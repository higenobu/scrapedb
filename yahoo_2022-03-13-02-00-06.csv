More than 2,000 residents of the southern city, which is now under Russian control, protested outside the city administration building to demand the release of the mayor, Ivan Fedorov, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the president's office, said. A call between Scholz, Macron and Russian President Vladimir Putin was underway, the French presidency said. Russia has not commented on the fate of Fedorov, who Ukrainian officials said was kidnapped by Russian forces on false accusations of terrorism. Zelenskiy said his country could not stop fighting but was upholding a ceasefire around an agreed humanitarian corridor out of the southern port of Mariupol, which has been under an almost two-week siege, and called on Russia to do the same.

3/13/2022,"By Michael Martina WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ukraine's stiff resistance against the invasion by Russian forces could be a model for Taiwan to defend itself should China choose to violate the island's ""sovereignty"" by attacking, a senior U.S. defense official told a Senate hearing on Thursday. The United States, like most countries, does not have formal ties with Taiwan but is its main arms supplier, and has long urged it to buy cost effective and mobile defense systems – so-called ""asymmetric"" weapons – to counter China's more powerful military. ""I think the situation we're seeing in Ukraine right now is a very worthwhile case study for them about why Taiwan needs to do all it can to build asymmetric capabilities, to get its population ready, so that it can be as prickly as possible should China choose to violate its sovereignty,"" Mara Karlin, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans and Capabilities, said. Under the United States' ""one China"" policy, Washington only acknowledges China's stance that the island belongs to it, but takes no position on Taiwan's sovereignty. China bristles at any reference to democratically self-governed Taiwan as independent, and Beijing's ambassador to Washington warned in January that U.S. encouragement of independence could trigger a military conflict between the two superpowers. China's embassy in Washington did not respond immediately to a request for comment on Karlin's remark to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Jessica Lewis, Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs, told senators that the United States continues to urge Taiwan to procure asymmetric systems, which had been ""used to great effect in Ukraine."" Taiwan needs to prioritize short-range air defense, naval sea mines and coastal defense and cruise missiles, Lewis said, adding that the United States and Taiwan were increasingly seeing eye-to-eye on what qualified as an asymmetric system. ""We're working with them on that today. I think we have a much deeper understanding of that right now,"" Lewis said. Lewis said Taiwan also needed to take a cue on reserve force reforms from Ukraine, which has volunteer territorial defense units and around 900,000 reservists, and that its population ""has to be ready to fight."" ""Obviously we don't want there to be a conflict in Taiwan,"" Lewis said. Taiwan has just created ""an all-out defense mobilization organization"" and is working with the U.S. National Guard in the development stage, Lewis said.

3/13/2022,"An unarmed, ""elderly"" Ukrainian couple who stood up to a group of Russian soldiers on their property is gaining international praise after video of the encounter went viral. ""#UkrainianHeroes,"" the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine tweeted Friday. ""Today we salute this elderly couple, who stood up to three Russian soldiers."" Surveillance video shows armed, uniformed troops breaking through a gate in the couple’s driveway with a dog barking somewhere nearby. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES After they walk out of the camera’s view, a loud gunshot can be heard. The video then cuts to another angle inside the gate, where the couple, wearing blue sweaters and black pants, approaches the soldiers. They can be heard shouting back and forth. A fourth soldier waited at the edge of the property as the argument heated up. After several minutes arguing, the soldiers turn around and leave. The couple walks them toward the gate, then closes it behind them. According to Ukraine media, the exchange took place in Mykolayiv Oblast, about 80 miles east of Odesa in the country’s south. UKRAINIAN LAWMAKERS, CEOS JOIN FIGHT AGAINST RUSSIA: ‘WE WILL FIGHT TO THE LAST BULLET’ It’s not the first time the U.S. government has praised Ukrainians for their bravery in the face of a larger, better equipped invading Russian army. ""The Ukrainians have also retained a lot of their combat power,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said during a news briefing a week into Vladimir Putin’s invasion. ""And they’re fighting back. They’re fighting back bravely."" And Ukrainian defense forces stationed on Snake Island in the Black Sea earned international praise on Feb. 24 when they responded to a Russian naval vessel demanding their surrender with defiance. ""Russian ship, go f--- yourself!"" one of them said over a loudspeaker. The 13 marines and border guards were initially believed to have been killed in the ensuing bombardment. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said they would all be honored posthumously as heroes. But the Ukrainian navy later announced they were all alive, captured by Russian forces. Ukraine’s Defense Ministry claimed it sank the ship that attacked the marines earlier this week after troops in the port city of Odesa launched a rocket attack at ships approaching their shores.

3/13/2022,"US officials say a superyacht docked in Italy could belong to Russian President Vladimir Putin. People briefed on the intelligence, however, said no set conclusions have been made, per The NYT. The $700 million superyacht is currently docked on the Tuscan coast of Italy. US authorities believe a $700 million superyacht that's docked in Italy could belong to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The New York Times reported the news, citing several people briefed on the information. The superyacht, called the Scheherazade, which is currently situated on the Tuscan coast of Italy first came to light after The Times reported Tuesday that Italian authorities were examining the 459-foot-long vessel. While some believed it could belong to a Russian oligarch, locals told The Times they nicknamed it ""Putin's yacht."" Following the invasion of Ukraine, Russia has been hit with wide-ranging sanctions targeting oligarchs and their luxury assets. Superyachts have come under particular scrutiny in recent weeks. US intelligence officials have not concluded who owns the Scheherazade but said they found initial indications that it was associated with Putin, per The Times. The people with knowledge of the matter would not describe what information led them to believe the superyacht was linked to the Russian President, according to the publication. The ship's captain, Guy Bennett-Pearce, told reporters earlier this week that Putin was not the owner of the ship and that he had never been on the yacht. He didn't, however, rule out the possibility of the owner being Russian. Meanwhile, the US and the other countries are doubling down on efforts to confiscate oligarchs' high-end assets. ""We are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts, your luxury apartments, your private jets,"" President Joe Biden said in his State of The Union address on March 1. ""We are coming for your ill-begotten gains."" Some oligarchs have scrambled to try and escape the sanctions against them, taking their private jets and ships to places like Dubai and the Maldives. Others like Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich are resorting to selling off their assets. The Scheherazade has been undergoing repairs since June 2020 in the small Italian town of Marina di Carrara. Its features include a helicopter landing pad, a large pool, a cinema, and a drone crashing system, according to Superyacht Fan.

3/13/2022,"Nick Fuentes, identified as a ""white supremacist"" in Justice Department filings, made headlines last week for hosting a white nationalist conference in Florida. His father is also half Mexican American. The big picture: Fuentes is part of a small but increasingly visible number of far-right provocateurs with Hispanic backgrounds who spread racist, antisemitic messages.

Subscribe for free Driving the news: Cuban American Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the Proud Boys, a group the Anti-Defamation League calls an extremist group with a violent agenda, was arrested Tuesday and charged with conspiracy in connection to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. What they're saying: Experts tell Axios far-right extremism within the Latino community stems from three sources: Hispanic Americans who identify as white; the spread of online misinformation; and lingering anti-Black, antisemitic views among U.S. Latinos that are rarely openly discussed. Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State University, said in an interview that the trend is ""part of the mutation that takes place as the racist fringe tries to become more mainstream."" Racism is deeply rooted in Latin American and Caribbean nations, where slavery was common, Tanya K. Hernández, a Fordham University law professor and author of the upcoming book, ""Racial Innocence: Unmasking Latino Anti-Black Bias,"" told Axios. ""In Latin America, white supremacy is alive and well.” Even families who have been in the U.S. for generations can often bring those biases with them. Between the lines: The U.S. trend, fueled over the course of Donald Trump's presidency and the pandemic, extends beyond movement leaders to a broader network of participants, some of whom have faced hate crimes charges. Last month, Jose Gomez III, 21, of Midland, Texas, pleaded guilty in federal court to three counts of committing a hate crime for attacking an Asian American family, including two children, he believed to be responsible for the pandemic. In 2018, Alex Michael Ramos, a Puerto Rican resident of Georgia, was sentenced by a Virginia District Court to six years in prison for his role in a beating of a Black man in Charlottesville, Virginia, following the ""Unite the Right"" rally. Christopher Rey Monzon, a Cuban American man and member of the neo-Confederate group League of the South, was arrested in 2017 for attempting to assault anti-racist protesters in Hollywood, Fla. He later resigned from the group and said he regretted using slurs for Black and Jewish people. Context: At the conference in Orlando, which made headlines because U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) accepted an invitation to speak, Fuentes drew attention for comments of his own: ""And now they’re going on about Russia and Vladimir Putin is Hitler — they say that’s not a good thing..."" He then laughed and said, ""I shouldn't have said that."" Fuentes has questioned the Holocaust, criticized interracial marriage and defended Jim Crow-era segregation. The ADL describes him as ""a white supremacist leader and podcaster who seeks to forge a white nationalist alternative to the mainstream GOP."" Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio wears a shirt supporting Derek Chauvin, the police officer convicted of killing George Floyd. Photo: Chandan Khanna/AFP via Getty Images Tarrio, 38, has previously faced charges: He was sentenced to five months in jail for setting fire to a Black Lives Matter banner stolen from a historic Black church in Washington, D.C. ""I'm pretty brown, I'm Cuban. There's nothing white supremacist about me,"" Tarrio told Insider in 2020. But Tarrio was suspended from Twitter in 2019 for posting anti-immigrant threats, has denigrated transgender people and has used racist language to describe a Black actor. But, but, but: There are limits to how accepted some far-right Latino activists can become in white supremacist and neo-Nazi circles, Mark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow at the ADL's Center on Extremism, told Axios. Some extremists on 4chan and 8chan say Fuentes' Latino heritage disqualifies him from speaking on white supremacy, Pitcavage said. Meanwhile, some white supremacist elements of the Proud Boys dismiss Tarrio as a leader but so far he has withstood the criticism, said Pitcavage, who monitors the chats. Tarrio's lawyer, Lucas Dansie, did not respond to emails seeking comment. Fuentes' American First Foundation also did not respond to requests for comment.
