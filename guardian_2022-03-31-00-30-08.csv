3/31/2022,"Calls to regulate against the potential incompetence of people who check fire risks in buildings before the Grenfell Tower disaster were dismissed by government ministers because of an “ideological” aversion to increasing red tape, the public inquiry has heard. Two coroners investigating earlier fire fatalities, the London Fire Brigade commissioner and the government’s own chief fire adviser were among experts who asked ministers to toughen scrutiny of fire risk assessors, according to testimony heard during cross-examination of Brandon Lewis, the first government minister to give evidence. The inquiry heard ministers were urged to tighten rules on seven different occasions in the decade before the fire. It has since emerged that the fire risk assessor hired by the Grenfell Tower landlord to check the disastrous refurbishment works was not qualified to say the cladding complied with regulations. Carl Stokes made up letters after his name to suggest professional registrations that either did not exist or which he did not have. He wrongly concluded the combustible cladding was “fire rated” in a move an expert to the inquiry dubbed “professionally reckless”. Lewis, who was minister responsible for fire safety from 2012 to 2014 and for fire services from July 2016 to June 2017, had been warned in writing about the competence of commercial fire risk assessors and how a lack of accreditation means “that in effect anyone can offer their services”. The inquiry heard that a coroner investigating six deaths from the Lakanal House high rise fire warned ministers in 2013 to clarify uncertainty about the scope of inspections. In 2016, another coroner investigating the death of a firefighter, Stephen Hunt, found inadequate fire risk assessments contributed significantly to his death. They told the government to ensure fire risk assessors are properly trained and accredited. Andrew Kinnear QC, counsel to the inquiry, said: “Nonetheless you remained content that intervention wasn’t required.” “Yes,” said Lewis, adding: “we were always looking at how we could devolve power from central government”. Kinnear put it to Lewis the government had an “ideological presumption” against regulation. “It wasn’t just an ideological thing around devolving, it was also around what practically was making the difference,” Lewis said. Lord Pickles, the former communities secretary; Lord Barwell, the former housing minister; Lord Wharton, a former junior minister; and Stephen Williams, a former Liberal Democrat junior minister are also set to appear to give evidence. They face questioning over claims Conservative-led governments prioritised a “bonfire of red tape” over safety. In 2012,the prime minister David Cameron resolved “to kill off the health and safety culture for good”. The inquiry has already heard from an official in the department of communities and local government, Louise Upton, that there was a “political predisposition against further statutory intervention in this field.” Lewis agreed in the sense “we would also look at [whether] you require statute to achieve what you want to achieve”. But he added “we had a fairly strong record … of being very, very serious about the work we were doing to ensure fire safety”. In July 2013 government officials tabled a proposal for a national regulator for fire safety, but an internal memo recorded Lewis was “not keen”. He told the inquiry he didn’t want to “create another layer of regulation that doesn’t deliver anything meaningful”. Ministers wanted a “self-governing sector” a government memo showed. It warned “the government’s policy of standing back to allow the sector to fill the space vacated by government is risky” . The risks included a threat to the government’s reputation for safeguarding public safety.

3/31/2022,"It seems fitting that the world of male golf is giddy with excitement over the possibility of Tiger Woods making an unlikely return at next week’s Masters. Before then Ko Jin-young has scope to build on the kind of run reminiscent of Woods in his pomp. The major year does not in fact begin at Augusta National on 7 April; on Thursday, Ko and co tee it up at the rebranded Chevron Championship at Mission Hills. Since last July Ko has secured six LPGA Tour victories. This run in just 11 tournaments includes a tie for second, two shared sixths and a tied fourth. Ko’s 60th place at the Evian Championship appears disastrous in context of her otherwise imperious form. Ko has returned 33 successive under-par rounds. Tiger-esque? Too right. The 26-year-old Korean arrived in California with a warning when asked whether she has reached her best level. “Not yet, no,” she insisted. “I am trying to play better than yesterday and even better than two days ago.” Ko is the star attraction in a major that will miss Nelly Korda, following the diagnosis of a blood clot for the former world No 1. Ko’s touch understandably means she tops the standings and she is candid about her desire to complete a career grand slam of majors, having won both the Evian and the Chevron (then called the ANA) in 2019. “Major competitions are a motivation in themselves,” Ko said. “That makes me a lot more focused. I love this course. I love to play here.” Unfortunately for Ko, this marks the last playing of the event at Mission Hills before a move to the Houston area, which is linked to Chevron’s multi-year sponsorship deal. It remains a pity that Augusta’s women’s amateur event clashes with a tournament carrying a $5m prize fund – $750,000 goes to the winner – given the ongoing battles of the women’s game to attract eyeballs. There are five amateurs in the Chevron field. While Ko will attract much attention on the west coast, it would be unwise to discount the chances of Georgia Hall. It seems incredible to think almost four years have passed since she claimed the Women’s British Open at Royal Lytham & St Annes, with the intervening time not always being kind to the Bournemouth golfer. Hall slipped outside the world’s top 50 last year but her victory at the European Tour’s event in Saudi Arabia earlier this month served notice of a player bouncing back. Hall’s only other win since her Lytham glory was in Portland in 2020. Now ranked 24th, Hall first played in the ANA as a 15-year-old amateur. “This year I thought, well, I just want to take it to another level,” Hall said. “I’m really ready to do that and I feel eager to win a lot more events. Get as good a ranking as I can do, world No 1, I would hope. “I was very happy the way I performed. Winning by five shots, leading start to finish was something I was very proud of. Both my previous big wins have come late, in the second half of the year, August, September, so that’s kind of why I was really glad to start off really well this year. Normally I have a fairly very slow start to the year, so, I was very happy to get the win.” Patty Tavatanakit saw off Lydia Ko by two shots 12 months ago. Ko had to change plans to compete in Saudi Arabia after contracting coronavirus, confined to quarantine in Singapore. “I didn’t have a lot of symptoms,” she explained. “It came more during when I was in quarantine. But it was very mild. When I did test negative I had a little bit of breathing issues and I felt like I had never seen the gym before. I was walking 30 minutes and my mask was completely drenched. It was really weird. “I normally run and try and stay on top of my workouts, and I felt like I had not done any of that. I was just doing my laundry and was totally out of breath, which is not what should happen normally. In about a week or so it was a lot better.”",Sport/Sport,Dominant Ko Jin-young turns sights on Chevron Championship at Mission Hills,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/30/ko-jin-young-chevron-championship-mission-hills
3/31/2022,"Stephen Colbert opened the Late Show with tentative good news from the war in Ukraine: the Russian military announced that it would “sharply reduce military activity” near Kyiv, “an area where – and I’m sure this is just a coincidence – they’re getting their ass handed to them by the Ukrainians,” Colbert said. “In a related story from March Madness,” he continued, “after losing to North Carolina, St Peter’s has announced it will sharply reduce basketball activity near the final four.” Peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul have shown marginal progress, Colbert noted, but “the vibes at these meetings have been very uneasy.” According to reports, Ukraine warned its negotiators not to eat, drink or touch anything out of poison concerns. “So basically, New York subway rules,” said Colbert. In domestic news, a federal judge ruled this week that Trump “more likely than not” committed a crime in trying to block confirmation of Biden’s win in the 2020 election. “Him crime-ing seems like a fair bet pretty much any day,” said Colbert. Another indicator of said crime is that “there seems to be a poorly executed cover-up going on here.” The House committee investigating the 6 January insurrection has the White House phone records from that day, though the committee revealed Tuesday that there’s a gap of seven hours and 37 minutes in the records, including the period when the Capitol was under assault by a pro-Trump mob. “Instead, for all of those hours, all the White House phone records just say, ‘scam likely,’” Colbert quipped. “Here’s the thing: we know the former president spoke to people like Kevin McCarthy and Jim Jordan during those seven hours and 37 minutes,” Colbert said. Which is the why the House panel is investigating whether Trump used backchannels to communicate that day, including burner phones. “I wouldn’t be surprised – he already has a burner son,” Colbert joked over a photo of Eric Trump. In Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel traced more fallout from the unmissable moment of the Oscars, when Will Smith slapped Chris Rock on stage. “I feel like if they discovered a live chicken on the moon, we would talk about it less than we do this slap,” said Kimmel. Kimmel touched on some of the stranger responses, such as conspiracy theories that the whole incident was staged to promote a comedy tour for Chris Rock and Kevin Hart. “What would lead someone to a conclusion like this?” Kimmel wondered. “Will Smith destroyed his reputation on the night he won an Oscar so Chris Rock and Kevin Hart could sell concert tickets? Chris Rock and Kevin Hart don’t need help selling concert tickets. Kevin Hart alone sells out like the Grand Canyon. This is ridiculous.” Kimmel also touched on the over seven-hour gap in the White House phone records. “So now the big question is, which White House toilet did [Trump] flush them down?” he wondered. While the select committee looks into whether Trump used a burner phone, Trump released a statement saying: “I have no idea what a burner phone is, to the best of my knowledge I have never even heard of the term.” “Which is interesting,” Kimmel noted, “because his former national security adviser John Bolton today revealed that he and Trump have spoken about how people use burner phones.” “Whenever Trump doesn’t know about something, he claims to know everything about it, like ‘I know more about windmills than everybody,’” Kimmel noted. “When it comes to things he might get in trouble for, all of a sudden he goes, ‘burner phones? Never heard of them. Hookers? What are those?’”",Arts/Culture,Stephen Colbert on Trump’s missing phone logs: ‘A poorly executed cover-up’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/30/stephen-colbert-jimmy-kimmel-trump-missing-phone-logs
3/31/2022,"Dominic Raab said he plans to appeal against the Parole Board’s decision to free the mother of Baby P, who died after months of abuse. The board said on Wednesday that a panel had directed the release of Tracey Connelly, who was jailed indefinitely with a minimum term of five years in May 2009 for causing or allowing the death of her 17-month-old son, Peter. He had suffered more than 50 injuries with the extent of the cruelty inflicted on him causing widespread shock and revulsion. At the beginning of a speech in the Commons outlining plans to reform the parole system to stop the release of dangerous offenders from prison, Raab, the justice secretary, said: “In light of the parole board’s direction to release Tracey Connelly , I should inform the house that having carefully read the decision I’ve decided to apply to the parole board to seek their reconsideration.” If the board agrees that the grounds for reconsideration are met, Connelly’s case will be looked at again and there could be a new hearing. However, in general it says “it will be unusual for a decision to change”. Connelly was released in 2013 but was returned to prison two years later for breaching her parole conditions. She was subsequently refused parole in 2015, in 2017 and again in 2019. Before Raab spoke, a Parole Board spokesperson said: “We can confirm that a panel of the Parole Board has directed the release of Tracey Connelly following an oral hearing. “Parole Board decisions are solely focused on what risk a prisoner could represent to the public if released and whether that risk is manageable in the community. “Parole reviews are undertaken thoroughly and with extreme care. Protecting the public is our number one priority.” The board said all professional witnesses supported Connelly’s release in evidence at the hearing and the secretary of state’s representative confirmed this recommendation was accepted. It added that witnesses told the panel Connelly posed a low risk of reoffending. Connelly’s boyfriend, Steven Barker, and Barker’s brother, Jason Owen, were also jailed in 2009 for causing or allowing Peter’s death. The case prompted a series of reviews, having been described as one of the most severe child protection failures since the murder of Victoria Climbié. Peter was on an at-risk register and received 60 visits from social workers, police and health professionals over eight months during which the abuse took place. The “Baby P” effect was said to have led to record numbers of “at risk” children being taken from their families, as local authorities lowered the threshold to remove a child, in the hope that it would reduce the chances of deaths.",News/Society,Dominic Raab to appeal against release of Baby P’s mother from prison,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/30/baby-p-tracey-connelly-mother-appeal-release-prison-dominic-raab
3/31/2022,"Western officials fear a UN pledging conference this Thursday aimed at raising more than $4.4bn (£3.34bn) aid for Afghanistan is likely to fall well short of its target. One UN official admitted he feared the Taliban’s increasingly repressive rule would lead to a donor backlash. The new UN appeal, on top of the flash appeal for $600m in the immediate wake of the Taliban takeover in August, is hoping to raise the single biggest sum ever for a single country at a pledging conference. But the decision by the Taliban on 23 March to renege on a pledge to let girls above grade 6 return to education, leading to street protests, is likely to put many donors off. The World Bank has put four projects in Afghanistan worth $600m from its reworked Afghan Reconstruction Trust Fund on hold until the position is clarified. Plans to pay teachers salaries through the fund are being reviewed, at least in the schools where older children are banned from schools. The UN estimates that around 10 million children across Afghanistan urgently need humanitarian assistance to survive. The UK announced on Wednesday it is providing £286m this financial year, the same as last year, promising none of the money would go to reward the Taliban. The sum was criticised by the former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell, who said the UK traditionally would have offered £325m, or 10% of the target. The UK is co-hosting the pledging event along with Germany, Qatar, and the UN. Preparations for the event have been relatively brief, and a Yemen pledging event fell short. Western aid formed 75% of the Afghan government budget before the Taliban took over. It had been hoped the UN’s pledging conference would take place against an optimistic backdrop of older children having just started the new school year for the first time the Taliban seized power, making international recognition of the Taliban a realistic objective. Repeated assurances that older girls would be able to attend, had been given to western officials, and Unicef agencies, right up to the start of the new school year, by those Taliban leaders that favour normalisation. But western officials now say they think their interlocutors were trying to ease through the reform in a low key way, establishing facts on the ground, without the supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, being fully consulted. Since then a raft of other repressive measures have been imposed over the transmission of western media, such as the BBC, and new requirements for men to wear beards if working in offices. Women have also been banned from travelling by air independently. Taliban determination to be able to direct or to tax humanitarian aid is also said to be rising. Achim Steiner, head of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), in Kabul this week warned further delays in starting classes not only harmed the girls’ futures, but risked Afghanistan being ignored. “For us and the United Nations, this is a critical moment in which the world needs to understand Afghanistan,” he told reporters on Monday. “But the leadership of Afghanistan must also recognise that the world can very easily turn to other crises.” If there were any “technical constraints” in reopening the schools the UN would make it a top priority to resolve them, Steiner said. “But if it were to signal a more fundamental reversal on this principle, it would indeed create I think a crisis in the way that both the international community and the country could relate to one another,” he said. With the west’s influence hitting a roadblock, China looks to be jumping in. Yue Xiaoyong, China’s special envoy for Afghan affairs, will host a two-day meeting starting on Wednesday in Tunxi, in eastern China’s Anhui province, of foreign ministers of Afghanistan’s six neighbouring countries. The acting foreign minister of the Afghan interim government, Amir Khan Muttaqi, is due to attend, as well as the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. The Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, made a surprise visit to Kabul last week “and stressed China “respects the religious beliefs and national customs of Afghanistan”, and “never interfered in Afghanistan’s internal affairs”. The UN security council, through a resolution last year, backed up by as many as seven US Treasury statements, has had some success in reassuring donors and aid agencies that it is possible to operate in the country without risk of US sanctions, but banks and finance houses remain nervous. Diplomatic recognition of the Taliban, much more possible if the education for secondary age girls had been allowed, now remains off the table, leaving the cloud of uncertainty about whether aid activity becomes sanctionable. The UN is still required to fund some of its activities by sending large suitcases of cash into Kabul. A World Bank fund for Afghanistan has released £1.2bn for development work, and the Asian Development Bank has a $405m fund.",News/World news,"Afghanistan aid pledges could fall far short of target, officials fear",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/30/afghanistan-aid-pledges-could-fall-far-short-of-target-officials-fear-taliban
3/31/2022,"While The Fiver is happy to concede that it is invariably “a small minority” of England fans who tend to behave like strutting, entitled numbskulls, unfortunately it is they who tend to leave the most lasting impression. Just as the loudest, most stupid voices tend to get the most attention on social media disgraces, it is the loudest, most stupid Ingerland fans who tend to sing about German bombers, stick fireworks up their nether regions and “occupy” foreign city squares. Last night, they were at it again. As the England team was read out over the Wembley Tannoy, a loud chorus of boos greeted the name of Harry Maguire, prompting no end of post-match handwringing from those who considered it despicable that a player who has done little or nothing wrong for his country should be booed by his own team’s fans, while wondering what possible good could come of jeering a player before a ball has been kicked. “I thought the reception was a joke,” said England manager Gareth Southgate, sounding uncharacteristically spiky. “An absolute joke. I don’t get it. What he has done for us is phenomenal. We’re either all in this together or we’re not.” We have been here before. Maguire is simply the latest in a long line of completely inoffensive England players to have been inexplicably booed by their own in recent years. Of course, the Manchester United defender is a big boy who is unlikely to let a minority of no-mark bullies get him down, but he will have felt mightily heartened – if slightly patronised – to see his manager and so many teammates rush to his defence. While the sight of fans criticising their own players is not uncommon we rarely see the shoe go on the other foot. However, Declan Rice, Jordan Henderson and Harry Kane were among those who felt confident enough to cut loose on Twitter without worrying about their tirades having an adverse effect on those all important fan sentiment graphs. “To hear @HarryMaguire93 booed at Wembley before kick-off was just not right,” tweeted Kane. Rather strangely, his employers were also quick to voice their solidarity with Maguire, tweeting: “No player deserves abuse. We stand with you @HarryMaguire93”. Having set this weird precedent, those in charge of the Tottenham social media account are likely to be kept busy in the coming weeks should their own players’ performances dip during the Premier League run-in. Curiously, despite their own astonishing devotion to their various social media channels, Manchester United’s much ridiculed Twitter team didn’t see fit to mention or condemn the abuse heaped upon their club captain until 50 minutes after Spurs had beaten them to it. “It goes without saying that everybody at Manchester United is behind our club captain and we look forward to showing him our support at Old Trafford on Saturday, in the Premier League match against his former club Leicester City,” stated the article to which their particular tweet linked. As a group of fans who might actually feel some justification in booing Maguire given his current run of club form, we look forward to seeing the Stretford End rise above their basic urges should he revert to type and accidentally slice the ball into his own net.

3/31/2022,"The UK government has announced plans to block ferries with crews paid less than the minimum wage from British ports in response to widespread fury to P&O Ferries’ sacking of 800 workers without consultation. The transport minister, Grant Shapps, told parliament on Wednesday that the government would write to the operators of British ports telling them to refuse access to companies that did not pay the UK minimum rate, adding: “This will have the full backing of the government.” He also outlined plans to create “minimum wage corridors” on ferry routes between the UK and other countries. P&O Ferries drew an outpouring of criticism and calls for action after its chief executive, Peter Hebblethwaite, acknowledged in extraordinary testimony to a parliamentary committee that the company had deliberately ignored employment law which requires companies to consult staff before making redundancies. It intends to hire cheaper workers that would not be subject to UK minimum wage laws. Hebblethwaite, whose basic annual salary is £325,000, told MPs last week that the average pay of the agency crew is £5.50 an hour. The minimum wage in the UK for people aged 23 and over is £8.91 an hour. Shapps has written to the Insolvency Service, the agency responsible for regulating company directors, saying he believed Hebblethwaite’s actions amounted to “sharp practices” that should disqualify him from leading a British company. The government will seek to bring in primary legislation to amend the Harbours Act of 1965 to include the minimum wage provision. However, it is obliged to consult the public before making changes, so the government will seek to use the voluntary block to make sure “P&O Ferries can derive no benefit from the action they have cynically taken”, Shapps said. The government is also considering changes to employment law to target “fire and rehire”, a deeply controversial practice used by big companies to cut wage bills. Shapps said the government would look at allowing courts or employment tribunals to take into account the manner of a dismissal, and give them the power to award 25% more in employment settlements. The changes – some of which have been demanded by opposition politicians and unions for years – come amid criticism aimed at the government over its inability to respond to the sackings. Shapps said ministers had instructed HM Revenue and Customs to inspect P&O Ferries’ tax affairs closely to ensure it was meeting minimum wage requirements. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency, a government body, has also detained two P&O Ferries ships, the European Causeway in Larne, Northern Ireland, and the Pride of Kent in Dover. P&O complained that the agency was exercising “an unprecedented level of rigour” in the safety inspections it was undertaking, according to the Press Association.",News/Business,UK announces plans to block ferries with crews paid less than minimum wage from its ports,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/30/uk-announces-plans-to-block-ferries-with-crews-paid-less-than-minimum-wage-from-its-ports
3/31/2022,"Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and other social media platforms, is reportedly paying a notable GOP consulting firm to create public distrust around TikTok. The campaign, launched by Republican strategy firm Targeted Victory, involved op-eds and letters to the editor being placed in various publications, accusing TikTok of being a danger to American children, along with other disparaging accusations. The firm wanted to “get the message out that while Meta is the current punching bag, TikTok is the real threat especially as a foreign owned app that is #1 in sharing data that young teens are using,” wrote a director for the firm in a February email, part of a trove of emails revealed by the Washington Post. “Dream would be to get stories with headlines like ‘From dances to danger: how TikTok has become the most harmful social media space for kids,’” another staffer wrote. Campaign operatives promoted stories to local media, including some unsubstantiated claims, that tied TikTok to supposedly dangerous trends popular among teenagers – despite those trends originating on Facebook. Such trends included the viral 2021 “devious lick” trend, where students vandalized school property. Targeted Victory pushed stories on “devious lick” to local publications in Michigan, Minnesota, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Washington DC. But the trend originally spread on Facebook, according to an investigation by Anna Foley with the podcast Reply All. Campaign workers also used anti-TikTok messages to deflect from pushback that Meta had received for its privacy and antitrust policies. “Bonus point if we can fit this into a broader message that the current bills/proposals aren’t where [state attorneys general] or members of Congress should be focused,” wrote a Targeted Victory staffer. In a comment to the Post, a TikTok representative said that the company was “deeply concerned” about “the stoking of local media reports on alleged trends that have not been found on the platform”.

3/31/2022,"UK judges have withdrawn from Hong Kong’s court of final appeal, citing concerns that their continued participation would appear to endorse the current administration amid dwindling political liberties and freedom of expression in the Chinese territory. Lord Reed, the president of the UK supreme court, the country’s highest court, said he and his colleague Lord Hodge had submitted their resignations as judges of the Hong Kong court of final appeal (HKCFA) with immediate effect. In a statement, published on Wednesday, Reed said: “The courts in Hong Kong continue to be internationally respected for their commitment to the rule of law. Nevertheless, I have concluded, in agreement with the government, that the judges of the supreme court cannot continue to sit in Hong Kong without appearing to endorse an administration which has departed from values of political freedom, and freedom of expression, to which the justices of the supreme court are deeply committed.” Judges of the supreme court and its predecessor, the appellate committee of the House of Lords, have sat on the HKCFA since 1997 when the UK returned the territory to China. In recent years, Beijing has increasingly interfered in the Hong Kong administration, with a crackdown on dissidents in the city state leading to thousands of arrests, an oppressive national security law imposed by China in 2020 and opposition politicians being barred from standing in elections. Reed’s decision marks a change of heart since August last year when he said that he and Hodge would remain engaged with the HKFCA with the support of the foreign secretary and the lord chancellor. That stance attracted criticism from some who believed it was lending credibility to an anti-democratic regime. The UK’s consul general in Hong Kong, Brian Davidson, said the government could no longer “endorse serving judges on the court of final appeal here”. “We support the people of Hong Kong and the principles of freedom and democracy, as promised in the joint declaration,” he said. Benedict Rogers, the chief executive of the UK-based Hong Kong Watch, said the decision “reflects the sad reality that the national security law has torn apart the human rights and constitutional safeguards which made Hong Kong meaningfully autonomous”. “The British judges’ ongoing presence was providing a veneer of legitimacy for a fundamentally compromised system, and the British government is right to have taken steps to recall them. The two judges who have resigned have done the right thing and we hope all remaining foreign judges will follow suit.” Chung Ching Kwong, the Hong Kong campaign’s director for the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, said the decision came as a surprise, given expectations of a Westminster Hall debate on Wednesday morning. Kwong told the Guardian the campaigners had been seeking to have the British judges removed from the court of final appeal as their presence was “no longer acting as a moderating force, as the government has claimed, but was giving a false sense of legitimacy to the Hong Kong government”. Kwong said the non-permanent judges had no impact over political cases, and so there was no positive influence they could wield by remaining. “They are only in the court of final appeal, and when it comes to national security law cases the Hong Kong government gets to handpick which judges can sit on the panel. None of the British judges have ever been chosen.” Tom Tugendhat MP, the co-chair of the China Research Group, set up by Conservative MPs in the UK, said: “Beijing’s repressive control of Hong Kong has eroded liberty in the city and turned law from a defence against tyranny to the tool of the tyrant. “It’s sadly right that the UK shifts its stance in response to the changing situation on the ground. British judges should not provide a veneer of legitimacy to a legal system that is now being used to lock up Hongkongers without due process” The decision will shift the spotlight on to the foreign judges remaining in Hong Kong, including a former justice of Australia’s high court, Robert French. In September 2020, another Australian judge, James Spigelman, resigned from the HKCFA two years before the expiration of his appointment, citing reasons “related to the content of the national security laws”. The Hong Kong government claimed it had “revoked” Spigelman’s appointment but did not provide details. Revocation of a judge can only be performed by a chief executive on the recommendation of a tribunal comprising at least three local judges, for “an inability to discharge his or her duties” or for “misbehaviour”, and it must be endorsed by the legislative council.",News/World news,UK judges withdraw from Hong Kong’s court of final appeal,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/30/uk-judges-withdraw-from-hong-kong-court-of-final-appeal

3/31/2022,"Starbucks paid just £5.4m in UK corporation tax last year despite making a gross profit of £95m. The company, which has faced years of heated criticism for paying very little tax in the UK, paid out £26.5m in royalty payments – almost five times as much the UK tax it paid, according to accounts filed at Companies House. The royalty payments helped Starbucks, which is run by the billionaire Howard Schultz, make a global profit of $4.9bn (£3.7bn) in the same period. The UK division collected sales of £328m from its 1,000 UK stores in the year to 3 October 2021, up from £243m in the previous year when shops were temporarily closed during the pandemic lockdown. Starbucks Coffee Company (UK) made a £95.1m “gross profit” for the year, but after swallowing “administrative expenses” of £78m, its pre-tax profits were reduced to £13.3m on which it paid £5.4m tax. A year earlier the company received tax credits of £4.4m after recording a pre-tax loss of £40.9m. The UK arm of Starbucks has made cumulative losses after tax of more than £100m between 2010 and 2021, according to a Guardian analysis of its accounts. It reported a profit in only five out of 12 years, but tax experts say it is unclear whether they are a true reflection of the business. Paul Monaghan, chief executive of the Fair Tax Foundation, said: “Starbucks’ main UK subsidiary maintained its tradition of paying little corporation tax in the UK, and this was once again down to the payment of hefty royalty and licensing fees to entities further up the corporate group. “The numbers now have a certain predictability.” In 2012, it was revealed that Starbucks had paid just £8.6m in taxes on £3bn in UK sales since 1998, when it launched its first UK coffee shop. The company declined to comment on the royalty payments or the reasons for its very low pre-tax profits in the UK. Separate accounts show that Starbucks’ UK-based European business paid just $13m in tax last year, while paying the coffee giant’s parent company in Seattle a $164m dividend. Starbucks Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) collected royalty payments of $237m in the year to 3 October. It made a pre-tax profit of $190m, and paid $13.1m in tax. The company said the tax payment was low because “this dividend income has already been taxed in other jurisdictions before it is booked for accounting purposes as a profit in Starbucks EMEA Limited. As the income has been taxed already, it is exempt from further UK corporation tax charges.” Starbucks EMEA, which collects royalties from 43 countries including the UK, has built up shareholder funds to more than $2tn. Starbucks Corporation, the US parent company, made an “operating income” profit of $4.87bn in the year to 3 October 2021, on sales of $29bn. Shultz, who transformed Starbucks from an 11-store Seattle chain he took over in 1986 into the global coffee empire, earlier this month announced that he was returning as interim chief executive. Shultz, who has built up an estimated $4bn fortune, is rejoining for his third stint as chief executive after the retirement of Kevin Johnson.",News/Business,Starbucks pays just £5m UK corporation tax on £95m gross profit,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/30/starbucks-uk-corporation-tax-profit-administrative-expenses-royalties
3/31/2022,"The high court has directed that a protester against the HS2 rail line who was originally acquitted of aggravated trespass should be convicted after an appeal by the director of public prosecutions. In a decision that will come as a blow to protesters more widely, two judges, including the lord chief justice, Lord Burnett, ordered that the case of Elliott Cuciurean be remitted to the magistrates court with a direction to convict. In the magistrates court, Cuciurean’s counsel had successfully argued that finding him guilty of aggravated trespass would be a disproportionate interference of his rights of freedom of expression and freedom of assembly under articles 10 and 11 respectively of the European convention on human rights. They had relied on the judgment of the supreme court when quashing the convictions of Nora Ziegler and three others who had formed a blockade outside a London arms fair. In that case, in June last year, the UK’s highest court said there must be a test of “proportionality” weighing up the defendants’ rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly against the disruption caused. The ruling was a boon for protesters and was subsequently cited in other cases, including by six climate crisis activists for a protest that halted the Docklands Light Railway and the acquittal of four people over the toppling the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol. But Wednesday’s ruling by the high court placed limits on its applicability. The written judgment said: “Ziegler does not lay down any principle that for all offences arising out of ‘non-violent’ protest the prosecution has to prove that a conviction would be proportionate to the defendant’s rights under articles 10 and 11 of the European convention on human rights.” It also distinguished between offences, such as those in the Ziegler case, subject to a defence of lawful or reasonable excuse, and those which are not. Another distinction it made in the current case was that the protest was on private property, stating: “Articles 10 and 11 do not bestow any ‘freedom of forum’ to justify trespass on private land or publicly owned land which is not accessible by the public.” Tom Wainwright, a criminal barrister at Garden Court law, specialising in protests, who was not involved in the current case, said: “It may be that this case will get appealed to the supreme court and they can then clarify what they actually meant [in Ziegler] but it kind of puts us back in the position before the Ziegler case.”",News/UK news,High court overturns acquittal of HS2 protester after appeal by prosecution,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/30/high-court-overturns-acquittal-of-hs2-protester-after-appeal-by-prosecution
3/31/2022,"Iwas thrilled when I got my first booking as a professional photographer. Until then, I’d treated photography as a side hustle, something I experimented with around other work. But when a well known company approached me to shoot their new collections I felt I’d really arrived. We planned a few sessions, but about 30 minutes into the first one I was taken to one side and asked to crop out the model’s face. Apparently she didn’t look quite the way the client had imagined when looking at her portfolio. The person who spoke to me actually described her as “really ugly”. I’m ashamed I didn’t walk out there and then. I did later manage to free myself from that client, but the experience left me determined to never collaborate with anyone who thought that way. Though I was excited by the idea of working in fashion photography, it highlighted how narrow the concepts of beauty can be in the industry. This reiterated what I’d learned growing up in a small town in Austria where everyone I saw on TV was white and representations of disability were very stereotypical. There was a degree of diversity in my own family that I just didn’t see reflected. But I moved to London in 2019 and started working with an agency called Zebedee, which represents models and creatives with disabilities or visible difference. That became the focus for a commission I worked on with Adobe last year, when I was asked to provide 20 portraits. I was staying with my boyfriend’s family near Plymouth and put a call out on Facebook asking for models. One of the responses was from the family of Megan, who appears in this picture. Megan was five when I met her. She has Down’s syndrome and is nonverbal but we really connected, partly through play. We were blasting the Moana soundtrack and the music from Frozen, which she loved. It just happens I know all the words so that was a great way to break the ice. There was a lot of dancing around and laughter. Megan really reminded me of myself at that age. Just like her, I was unable to sit still for 10 seconds. That also meant it wasn’t easy to get pictures of her looking at the camera, but working with children is usually chaotic anyway – I just try to work around what they’re doing. In this case, I was more like a friend hanging out with the family. I’d only pick up the camera every once in a while. I got several shots I was happy with, including one taken through a blue plastic folder I had with me. Megan had an older sister, Mia, who I’d been told was too shy to be photographed but as soon as I saw them together, I realised how much Megan admired her sister. I really wanted to get a photo of the two of them. It was quite a moody day and the light in the room wasn’t great, but I try to work with natural light whenever possible, even on fashion shoots. Subjects, especially kids, tend to be more relaxed when they’re not surrounded by lights and lots of equipment, plus it means the shoot can be more spontaneous. I don’t think this shot would have happened in a cluttered set-up. When Mia kissed Megan’s forehead, the chaos surrounding the rest of the shoot fell away and everything seemed to stand still. When I first got into photography, I honestly never imagined my work having a positive impact on others, so it’s a real honour whenever anyone messages me to say they’ve been touched by one of my pictures. I remain determined to do everything in my power to change the way the industry operates. It still feels like there’s a long way to go – we don’t see enough images of people with disabilities just living their everyday lives. But it does feel like the inclusion revolution is gradually moving forward and I’m proud to be a part of it.

3/31/2022,"Israel has convened its security cabinet for emergency talks after the bloodiest attack in years in greater Tel Aviv, which marked the third such killings spree in the Jewish state in a week and has left Israelis and Palestinians bracing for further violence. “We are dealing with a new wave of terror,” the country’s far-right prime minister, Naftali Bennett, said in a statement ahead of the meeting. “As in other waves, we will prevail.” The defence minister, Benny Gantz, announced he had ordered 1,000 soldiers to bolster police forces, and Israel’s military presence in the Palestinian territories it occupies has been reinforced. The attacks come at a dangerous time. Next month, a rare convergence of Ramadan for Muslims, Passover for Jews and Easter for Christians is expected to raise tensions, with people off work and in the streets. Israel tightly controls access to Jerusalem’s holy sites for all three religions, which has previously led to confrontations. Those holidays also precede a series of delicate anniversaries in the coming weeks. Some, such as Israeli independence day and the Palestinian Nakba commemoration of their expulsion, are decades old. Others are fresher, such as the one-year anniversary of the 11-day May conflict that killed more than 250 people in Gaza and 13 in Israel. In the aftermath of Tuesday’s shooting rampage in Bnei Brak on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, one car’s white leather seats had been stained with blood, as were the front tiles of a nearby grocery shop, near multipacks of Coca-Cola bottles and a crisp packet stand. The victims were a diverse mix – two Jewish ultra-Orthodox residents, Yaakov Shalom, 36, and Avishai Yehezkel, 29; two unnamed Ukrainians living in Israel as constructions workers; and Amir Khoury, 32, a Christian Arab police officer who had engaged in a firefight with the attacker. Police identified the perpetrator as Diaa Armashah, 27, a Palestinian from the occupied West Bank. He had arrived in Bnei Brak with an M-16 assault rifle and opened fire on cars, cyclists and balconies. Amateur video footage showed a man wearing black walking into a street with a long gun as people ran away. At one of the victim’s funerals on Wednesday, Ovadia Yehezkel said his brother, Avishai, had used his body to shield his two-year-old son in a stroller. “You cared for your son; you did not give up,” Ovadia said in a eulogy, according to the Times of Israel news outlet. Israeli forces operating in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday arrested five Palestinians allegedly involved. The Palestinian Prisoner’s Club, a group that represents current and former Palestinian prisoners, said those arrested were Amarshah’s relatives. Bnei Brak’s bloodshed brought the total death toll in Israel in recent days to 11, the highest number of people killed by militants in such a short period outside wartime in several years. Last week, an attack in the southern city of Beersheba, in which four people were killed in a stabbing and car-ramming rampage, was carried out by an Arab citizen of Israel. On Sunday, an Arab assailant, a resident of a town in the north of the country, shot and killed two police officers in Hadera, a city north of Tel Aviv, before he was gunned down by other officers. Both those attacks were claimed by Islamic State, an organisation that is not known to have a large presence inside the country but which Israeli and Palestinian authorities fear could wield increased influence. Amos Harel, a military and defence correspondent for Haaretz newspaper, said Tuesday’s attack – which he said may have been a “copycat” attack by a sympathiser inspired by last week’s attacks – was “Israel’s worst fear come true”. “On three separate occasions, terrorists managed to reach the heart of cities inside Israel and carry out campaigns of slaughter unhindered,” he wrote. “None of the attacks were preceded by intelligence warnings. For now, the terrorists seem to be one step ahead of the security services, which still seem to be groping in the dark. Israelis’ sense of personal security has suffered a serious blow.” He added: “In the coming days, we will likely see more stormy demonstrations, calls for vengeance and perhaps attacks on Palestinians and Israeli Arabs. Similar things happened last May during the Hamas-Israel war in the Gaza Strip.” The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, who is based in the West Bank, issued a condemnation of the Tuesday night attack. “The killing of Palestinian and Israeli civilians will only lead to further deterioration of the situation, while we are all striving for stability,” Abbas said in a statement. Earlier this week, Israel hosted a summit of Arab foreign ministers from Morocco, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain in the Negev desert. Israel’s budding ties with former Arab foes, while continuing to control the lives of several million Palestinians living under occupation, have led to a sense of desperation and anger among Palestinians.",News/World news,Israel steps up security after Tel Aviv attack amid fears of ‘new wave of terror’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/30/israel-steps-up-security-in-aftermath-of-tel-aviv-attack
3/31/2022,"Ihave been having so many baby dreams recently. Nonsensical images of babies sliding down chutes and falling into deep water below. Dreams where I dive in and swoop the babies to safety, pushing the water from their lungs and wrapping them in soft blankets, lined up as I watch over them. I know why. There is no deep Freudian meaning to find – the publication of the Ockenden report into failings in maternity services in England has meant that the events of nearly 20 years ago, yet again, have begun to stalk both my conscious and unconscious mind. I gave birth twice at Royal Shrewsbury hospital. “Gave birth” sounds so everyday, so ordinary, so gentle, but in reality both of my experiences were visceral, violent and have stayed with me for two decades. For the birth of my first child, a son, I arrived at the ward, contracting regularly and close to needing to push. The baby was back to back so I was in lots of pain. I was given pethidine, a drug that rendered me drunk and forgetful, my agency gone. Perhaps it is a blessing that I can only remember snapshots of the next four hours; the abject terror on my partner’s face, the hastily inserted drip to restart my contractions and the fretful scribbling of the CTG machine showing them rising off the scale. After interminable hours, a doctor was called and then another. They attempted a ventouse delivery and I can remember the cup popping off the baby’s head and the doctor reeling backwards. Next the forceps were used and finally after hours of pain my son was delivered. He was big for a first baby and bore the scars of the forceps blades down both sides of his face. I was so dizzy with love for him that I just accepted what had happened, assuming that my body was somehow at fault for not being able to birth him “naturally”, without the aid of the instruments used. After all, I had read all the books and swallowed the dogma that natural birth was a desirable and attainable goal for all women. That the C-section that I probably should have had was in some way a failure, an indictment of my shortcomings as a childbearing woman. This was the prevailing ethos at Shrewsbury, an attitude that shamed women into blaming themselves when something went wrong. At the time, Shrewsbury was an outlier and in 2002 just 11% of births there were by C-section – a fact that was actually applauded by the Commons health select committee – while the UK average was 20%. It has not been recognised until recently that these figures represented a blinkered and dangerous approach. I foolishly thought, some years later, that my second birth would somehow exorcise the ghosts of the first. As full term approached, I would tell anyone who would listen that I could feel this baby’s shoulders grinding on my pelvis. At a checkup at 37 weeks, I was dismissed by my consultant when I enquired whether I might need a C-section this time. Due to the “natural birth” dogma I had ingested, it was something that I did not ask for loudly enough, too intimidated by this senior doctor who dismissed my fears and worries; telling me that a 4kg baby was not considered to be large. In what I assume as a compromise, I was informed that I would be induced on my due date. It was snowing that night. Everything seemed to be proceeding normally – my waters broke at 9pm and by midnight I was taken to a labour room. I was monitored again as I was considered a high-risk pregnancy. I could see marked decelerations in my baby’s heartbeat during each contraction and waited for the midwife to return so I could tell her. In what seemed a matter of moments, the baby was coming out and rapidly the head was born. Then nothing. The midwife told my birth companion that this was a sign of shoulder dystocia – where the baby’s shoulder gets stuck in the pelvis – and hastily banged the alarm bell on the wall. The midwife, eyes darting to and from the clock, shouted out various manoeuvres as she tried to free my baby; each failed. It was brutal and horrific. No additional staff arrived. My poor baby was being crushed by my body, starved of oxygen, primed to expand their lungs but unable to do so. Eventually the midwife managed to free the shoulder and there was my daughter, wrenched out on to the bed, navy blue and seemingly lifeless, an image I will never forget. Silence roared around my ears. No crying, no breaths even. At some point someone else must have entered the room. Resuscitation began and I waited, flattened by fear and panic, to hear her cry. She began to grunt, a sign, I later learned, of respiratory distress. The medical staff feared she had a chest infection, and she was taken to the special care baby unit (SCBU) – I didn’t get to touch or hold her and was given a Polaroid to look at instead. The paediatrician attempted to explain that her arm might be damaged. I was confused, I couldn’t understand what he was telling me, couldn’t understand the words. I felt as if I was at the end of a long tunnel where no one could reach me. I was in shock and the stitching had to be delayed as a result. I awoke hours later, still covered in blood, not sure, in her absence, if I had had the baby or not. I was wheeled to see her and found her dressed in borrowed clothes, in a plastic cot, pink now and sleeping. I began a cycle of self-blame and hatred that, yet again, I had been unable to give birth “properly”. For years I believed that a shoulder dystocia could not be predicted and that again my body had failed me. I have since learned that there are predictors – and that I ticked many boxes. It didn’t have to happen, it could have been prevented. If only I had insisted on a C-section, perhaps things would have been different. But I now know that I probably would not have been granted one anyway. It was Shrewsbury’s failure, not mine. I had a third baby. That baby was born in a different county after an initial meeting with the consultant at Shrewsbury where I was yet again belittled and my fears dismissed. I was once more refused a C-section. This time everything was different. My views and thoughts were listened to and I gave birth in a controlled and managed environment. My daughter carries a lifelong anxiety that I have been told by one of the many psychologists, psychiatrists and other health professionals I have employed to help her over the years, could be related to the trauma and massive bolt of stress chemicals she was subjected to at birth. The legacy I carry myself, apart from the scars, is in a box inside my head. Mostly it remains untouched, but sometimes I revisit it. My box has a baby, a child and now an adult in it. Many families were left with an empty box, left with no baby to take home. I weep for those families and for myself but there is also rage, a deep, scorching rage, that so many baby deaths and injuries were preventable. We must all weep and rage to ensure that what happened at Shrewsbury is never allowed to happen again.",Opinion/Opinion,Mothers were shamed and traumatised at Shrewsbury hospital.
