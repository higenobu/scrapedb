12/21/2021,"Trump's supporters booed when he announced he got the COVID booster shot. The audience cheered when Trump said he was opposed to vaccine mandates. But the reaction changed when Trump and Bill O'Reilly said they were vaccinated and got boosters. Supporters of former President Donald Trump booed and jeered when he announced on Sunday that he had received a COVID-19 booster shot and was in favor of the vaccine. Trump made the comments during an appearance on the former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly's ""History Tour."" Newsweek first reported on the remarks. At the tour, Trump noted that the COVID-19 vaccine was developed under his administration as part of Operation Warp Speed. ""Look, we did something that was historic, we saved tens of millions of lives worldwide when we, together, all of us, we got a vaccine done,"" Trump said. ""This was going to ravage the country far beyond what it is right now, take credit for it,"" Trump said. ""It's great, what we've done is historic. Don't let them take it away."" The former president drew cheers from the crowd when he said that he was opposed to vaccine mandates, adding, ""If you don't want to take it, you shouldn't be forced to take it, no mandates."" But the crowd's reaction shifted when Trump and O'Reilly revealed they were both vaccinated and had gotten booster shots. According to Newsweek, O'Reilly told the audience that he and Trump were both vaccinated. He also asked Trump if he received a booster shot, to which Trump replied, ""Yes."" ""I got it, too,"" O'Reilly said. Newsweek reported that the crowd then started booing Trump and that he had to tamp down the audience's reaction which appeared to be coming from one side of the arena. ""Don't, don't, don't,"" Trump said. ""That's alright, it's a very tiny group up there."" Trump's acknowledgment that he got a booster came a few months after he told reporters that he would not be getting an additional shot. ""I feel like I'm in good shape from that standpoint — I probably won't"" get one, he told The Wall Street Journal in a September interview. ""I'll look at stuff later on ... I'm not against it, but it's probably not for me."" Trump has repeatedly sent mixed messaging about the COVID-19 vaccine to his base, a big chunk of which remains reluctant to get the shot. While the Biden administration has pushed Americans hard to get one of the three available COVID-19 vaccines — which have been proven effective at significantly reducing the likelihood of hospitalization and death from the disease — Trump has said that while the shots are safe, Americans should not be required to get them. The former president first encouraged Americans to get vaccinated in March, months after the vaccine was first developed and after he left office. The New York Times reported that both Trump and former First Lady Melania Trump privately received their vaccines in January, before he left office. Trump's approach to getting vaccinated stood in stark contrast to that of other public officials, including former Vice President Mike Pence, President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and former presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and George Bush, all of whom received their vaccinations on camera to build public trust. The former presidents also released an ad campaign in March urging Americans to get vaccinated. Trump was the only one who did not participate in the video.

12/21/2021,"Far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) is using the new COVID-19 surge to sow more doubt about the coronavirus vaccines, which sharply reduce the chances of serious illness and death. Greene on Sunday tweeted a link to an article about New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker’s breakthrough case in which he credited vaccination for keeping his symptoms minor. “How many breakthrough cases of polio are there?” Greene wrote. Greene’s off-key comment comparing breakthrough COVID cases, which are mostly mild, with polio, which was mostly eradicated in the decades after a vaccine was introduced, landed with a thud. As usual, the anti-vaccine, pro-conspiracy lawmaker missed the point ― and was flat-out wrong, people on Twitter pointed out. Critics noted the near-universal compliance with the polio shot. Only 61% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated against the coronavirus ― and many who refuse the shots buy into anti-vaccine conspiracy theories pushed by the likes of Greene. They also schooled Greene on the COVID-19 vaccines’ proven protection against death and hospitalization, and provided some history about vaccines in America. And, yes, there have been breakthrough cases of polio and even measles, despite the game-changing inoculations. This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

12/21/2021,"Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa touched down to Earth on Monday (December 20) after a 12-day journey into space. It was the end of a practice run for his planned trip around the moon with Elon Musk's SpaceX in 2023. The 46-year-old fashion magnate and art collector launched from Kazakhstan on December 8 along with his assistant Yozo Hirano and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin. Maezawa, a space enthusiast, made the trip in a Soyuz spacecraft and became the first space tourist to travel to the International Space Station (ISS) in more than a decade. One of Japan's most flamboyant public figures, the entrepreneur returned to snowy conditions on Earth, with precipitation and sub-zero temperatures at the landing site. He entertained his social media followers from space by taking photos of his home province, showing how to make tea in zero gravity and discussing the shortage of fresh underwear. Maezawa will become the first private passenger on the SpaceX moon trip in 2023, as commercial firms including Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin usher in a new age of space travel for wealthy clients.",Science/Reuters Videos,Japan billionaire lands after 12-day space flight,https://news.yahoo.com/japan-billionaire-lands-12-day-133239691.html
12/21/2021,"Source: @pixabay / nappy.co Infamous image and dating consultant Kevin Samuels is at it again and of course, he comes barring another startling message for Black women. In a short clip captured from one of his most recent live streams, Samuels argues that Black women shouldn’t be concerned with their white female counterparts taking their men. He strongly believes “Hispanic” women are the group’s biggest enemy. “Your biggest enemy is the Hispanic women. She understands how to season food. She understands sensuality, feminity and she was raised in a patriarchal environment,” Samuels says. “The difference between feminity and fake feminity is amazing. Black women you have a problem– the Latina problem,” he reinforces. Samuels often puts his foot in his mouth. Clearly, he didn’t get the memo that Hispanic women are—in fact—white women and Afro-Latina women are indeed Black. While Kevin’s message may be a bit abrupt and misinformed, there is data that suggests an uptick in interracial marriage, not only for Black men but for Black women too. According to a Pew Research study conducted from 2014 to 2015, the data found that Black men were twice as likely as Black women to marry a spouse of a different race or ethnicity, that’s 24 percent versus 12 percent, respectively. The cause was linked to education rates among the group. Interracial marriage rates were found to be significantly higher among Black people who obtained a bachelor’s degree (21 percent). While only 17 percent of Black folks who had some college education married someone of a different race or ethnicity. The number dropped to 15 percent with those only holding a high school diploma or less. The same trend proved to be similar within the Hispanic community. “While 16 percent of those with a high school diploma or less are married to a non-Hispanic” the number nearly doubled to 35 percent among those with some college background. Hispanic men and women obtaining a bachelor’s degree or higher were 46 percent more likely to marry outside of their race than those with a bachelor’s degree or higher, but again the study doesn’t indicate enough evidence to support Kevin’s claims. However, the marriage gap continues to increase, particularly for Black women. Statistics collected by Vox Eu found that in 2006, “67 percent of white women between ages 25 and 54 were married” while “only 34 percent” of Black women were married – “a gap of 33 percentage points.” The publication attributed the drastic divide to the difference in societal issues impacting both groups, noting how poverty, crime, and incarceration rates drastically affect the Black family structure. So, while Black women might not be faced with a “Latina Problem,” social issues are a more evident culprit when it comes to jumping the broom—they may even spare us a few marital woes.
