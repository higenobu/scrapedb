5/20/2022,"(Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday said Russian forces had ""completely destroyed"" the industrial Donbas region and accused Moscow of carrying out senseless bombardments as it intensified its offensive. Zelenskiy also accused Russian forces of attempting to kill as many Ukrainians and do as much damage as possible, repeating his charge that Russia was carrying out a genocide. Zelenskiy said that while Ukrainian forces were continuing to liberate the Kharkiv region to the east of Kyiv, Russia was trying to exert even more pressure in the Donbas, which lies in the southeastern part of Ukraine. ""It is hell there - and that is not an exaggeration,"" he said in a late night video address, adding that 12 people had been killed in the ""brutal and absolutely senseless bombardment"" of Severodonetsk on Thursday. ""(There are) constant strikes on the Odesa region, on the cities of central Ukraine. The Donbas is completely destroyed,"" he said. ""This is a deliberate and criminal attempt to kill as many Ukrainians as possible, to destroy as many houses, social facilities and enterprises as possible."" STORY: A Russian soldier asked a Ukrainian widow to forgive him for murdering her husband, as a Kyiv court heard the first war crimes trial arising from the Russian invasion.At the second hearing on Thursday (May 19), Kateryna Shelipova, asked 21-year-old tank commander Vadim Shishimarin if he repented. “Yes. I admit guilt. I understand that you will not be able to forgive me. I ask for forgiveness.”Shishimarin had pleaded guilty a day before to killing the unarmed 62-year-old civilian. Oleksandr Shelipov died in the northeast Ukrainian village of Chupakhivka, a few days after Russia's invasion on February 24th.The widow told the court she heard shots fired from their yard and called out to her husband, who was wearing civilian clothes. He was already dead, she said. ""I screamed so much.""The Kremlin has said it has no information about the trial and that the absence of a diplomatic mission in Ukraine limits its ability to provide legal assistance. Elsewhere during the months of conflict, Ukraine has accused Russia of atrocities and brutality against civilians and has identified what it says are more than 10,000 possible war crimes. The International Criminal Court is leading a team of prosecutors investigating war crimes allegations in the country. Russia has denied targeting civilians or involvement in such crimes.Shishimarin is accused of firing several shots with an assault rifle at Shelipov's head from a car after being ordered to do so. Asked if he had been obliged to follow that order, he said ""no."" He could face up to life imprisonment if convicted.Ukraine is currently gripped by the fate of hundreds of its own soldiers who gave themselves up to Russia.Kyiv hopes Moscow will hand them over as part of a prisoner swap. But some Russian voices are calling for them to now be put on trial.

5/20/2022,"Elon Musk says he's wading into politics to stop the ""woke mind virus"" from destroying civilization. He replied to a question on Twitter about why he was focusing on politics and not on going to Mars. Musk's comments came following a report on a 2018 sexual misconduct claim against the billionaire. Elon Musk said on Twitter on Thursday that he is becoming politically active to stop ""the woke mind virus"" from preventing humankind from reaching Mars. Musk made the remarks while responding to a Twitter user's questions on an earlier tweet by the billionaire. On Wednesday, Musk posted on the platform claiming that ""political attacks"" on him would ""escalate dramatically in coming months."" ""Just curious...what is your motivation to become politically active? Why make yourself a target?"" the Twitter user asked. ""You are trying to get mankind to Mars and alert the public to the danger of AI. Why sabotage these worthwhile goals by wading into political controversy? Is it worth it?"" In response, Musk wrote: ""Unless it is stopped, the woke mind virus will destroy civilization and humanity will never reached Mars."" Over the last month, Musk has mentioned the ""woke mind virus"" on several occasions. On Wednesday, he called Yale the ""epicenter of the woke mind virus attempting to destroy civilization."" And in April, Musk used the term in a tweet, stating that it is ""making Netflix unwatchable."" While Musk hasn't outlined what he thinks constitutes the ""woke mind virus,"" the word ""woke"" has been co-opted and weaponized by right-wing figures to mock progressive causes. Musk also bashed the Democratic party in a tweet on Wednesday, calling it ""the party of division and hate."" In the same tweet, he doubled down on his resolution to vote Republican this election — several days after he first stated that stance during a tech conference. Musk's comments on Thursday came in the wake of a bombshell Insider article detailing how his aerospace firm, SpaceX, paid a flight attendant $250,000 to settle a sexual misconduct claim against the billionaire.
