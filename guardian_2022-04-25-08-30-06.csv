4/25/2022,"International travel should be protected in future pandemics, MPs have urged, describing the Covid restrictions imposed by the UK government as confusing, arbitrary and disproportionate. The Commons transport select committee said the government should learn lessons from the coronavirus pandemic to create a predictable and transparent system for future public health crises, to support travellers and the aviation industry. In a critical report, it said the curbs on foreign travel during the pandemic were “disproportionate to the risks to public health”. The cross-party committee said restrictions should be comparable to those applied domestically, and international travel should not be “singled out”. The report concludes that the “decision-making process was not transparent or consistent, nor based on scientific consensus”, resulting in rules that caused “a severe financial shock to the sector”. The committee also criticised ministers for abdicating all responsibility for the queues, cancellations and delays seen this Easter as airlines and airports struggled to recruit staff in time for a resurgence in passenger demand, after the sudden lifting of all Covid isolation and testing requirements. It said the government was attempting to “lay the blame on an aviation sector decimated by restrictions and a lack of certainty offered by ministers”, but should review its own recruitment and training processes. Airlines and airports have complained of delays in government security checks for job applicants. The committee’s chair, Huw Merriman, said: “Government action was inconsistent. It left industry and passengers confused and unable to plan ahead. This resulted in a severe economic deficit for the aviation sector. “Ministers must get on with protecting the sector against future economic shocks and reassuring passengers that future restrictions will only be implemented in extreme circumstances. Legislation is urgently needed to give the industry more flexibility to recruit new staff for the summer, to give the regulator more teeth to intervene on behalf of consumers and to provide protection from airline insolvencies.” He added: “Above all, we want ministers to be transparent with industry and passengers. Over Easter we witnessed a sector in the early stages of recovery and vulnerable to disruption. The increase in demand is encouraging but a sustained and supportive approach from government is vital to nurse the sector back to recovery.” The report calls for measures including publishing a promised aviation recovery plan; introducing an airline insolvency bill to protect consumers, employees and taxpayers; and giving the regulator more powers to fine airlines for not refunding customers when required. The Airport Operators Association said the report was “welcome recognition of the devastating impact the pandemic had on aviation”. Its chief executive, Karen Dee, said: “We join the committee in calling for a comprehensive recovery package that allows our sector to recover sustainably and prevents the UK from falling behind our international competitors.” The latest indictment of the UK’s Covid travel policies follows a critical National Audit Office report last week that found central government lost track of spending and made up rules on the hoof – as well as leaving the taxpayer on the hook for around £400m for quarantine hotels that ministers thought would be paid for by travellers. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “Our priority was protecting public health, and these measures bought vital time for the rollout of our successful booster programme as we responded to new and concerning variants. But we also ensured they were in place for no longer than absolutely necessary, and the UK was the first country in the G7 to remove all travel restrictions. “In future the government’s default approach will be to use the least stringent measures, to minimise the impact on travel as far as possible, and these will only be implemented in extreme circumstances.”",News/Business,"UK Covid travel rules were arbitrary and disproportionate, say MPs",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/25/uk-covid-travel-rules-were-arbitrary-and-disproportionate-say-mps
4/25/2022,"Fewer than 200 people who came to the UK without authorisation would have been sent to Rwanda last year, analysis of government figures has found. The Refugee Council said 172 people could have been sent to the east African country had a deal been in place. It estimates that this year the number is not likely to be much higher. The figures cast doubt on Boris Johnson’s claim that “tens of thousands” of people who have arrived in the UK without authorisation could be given a one-way ticket to Rwanda. People eligible for removal to Rwanda will be those judged “inadmissible” under the rules of the UK asylum system. The rules, introduced in January 2021, apply to those who arrived in the UK via another “safe” country, such as France, and therefore their asylum claim is considered their responsibility. So far only 2%t of people considered under the rules are ultimately served with decisions classifying them as inadmissible, Home Office figures unearthed by the Refugee Council show. Of the 8,593 people considered under the rules by the Home Office last year, only 172 would be deemed inadmissible, according to the analysis. Johnson claimed this month that he expected many people to be flown 4,500 miles to Rwanda. “The deal we have done is uncapped, and Rwanda will have the capacity to resettle tens of thousands of people in the years ahead,” he said. Government plans to punish people who have been forced to take an irregular journey to Britain could lead thousands of people seeking asylum to be convicted and imprisoned. Under the nationality and borders bill, which is in its final stages before parliament, the analysis suggests 19,288 people could be convicted and imprisoned each year for arriving in the UK via an irregular route. The proposal has been widely condemned as inhumane, illegal, unworkable and prohibitively expensive. Critics have included Tory MPs and peers, the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) and the archbishop of Canterbury, who said in his Easter Sunday sermon that the scheme “does not stand the judgment of God”. Enver Solomon, the CEO of the Refugee Council, said: “This analysis shows the real impact this bill will have on desperate men, women and children who are simply trying to find safety when fleeing the dangers of war and persecution. “Punishing people, treating them like criminals and human cargo to be expelled to Rwanda is not only inhumane, cruel and nasty but it will do nothing to address the reasons why people take perilous journeys to find safety in the UK. It will do little to deter them from coming to this country, but only lead to more human suffering and chaos – at a huge potential expense of nearly a billion pounds each year.” The bill, if it passes into law, will create a new criminal offence that will apply to all those who are intercepted in the Channel without prior authorisation to enter the UK. People prosecuted under the new law could face prison sentences of up to four years. The Refugee Council has used figures from the Home Office and Crown Prosecution to estimate that up to 19,288 could be convicted and imprisoned each year under the changes. It has estimated that the cost of prosecuting and imprisoning them could reach £835m a year. The estimate is based on the number of people crossing the Channel last year, the assumption that the government would seek to prosecute everyone arriving illegally, and a conviction rate of 69% over the last five years for similar offences in existing law. A Home Office spokesperson said: “This world-leading migration and economic development partnership will overhaul our broken asylum system, which is currently costing the UK taxpayer £1.5bn a year – the highest amount in two decades. “Under this agreement, Rwanda will process claims in accordance with national and international human rights laws. It means those arriving dangerously, illegally or unnecessarily can be relocated to have their asylum claims considered and, if recognised as refugees, build their lives there. “We do not recognise the figures derived from this analysis. The agreement is uncapped in terms of the numbers of people who may be sent to Rwanda.”",News/UK news,Refugee data analysis casts doubt on Boris Johnson’s Rwanda claim,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/25/refugee-data-analysis-casts-doubt-on-boris-johnsons-rwanda-claim
4/25/2022,"The government will seek to implement all 10 of the key recommendations of the fan-led review into English football, setting up the possibility of a sea change in the governance of the national sport. Five months after a landmark report led by Conservative MP Tracey Crouch called for the creation of an independent regulator for the game, alongside greater powers for supporters and an improved “owners and director’s test” for those seeking to control local clubs, sport minister Nigel Huddleston will tell parliament on Monday that the government endorses the ideas. A white paper bringing forward legislation will be published in the summer. Among the recommendations that are now to be brought forward include the creation of “shadow boards” consisting of club supporters that would allow fans to have a greater input into decision making in their clubs. Supporters groups would also get a “golden share” in their club, providing a veto on a number of key decisions, including whether to sell the club’s stadium, as well as heritage issues, such as the team’s crest or colours. There will also be a pledge to introduce stronger mechanisms to guarantee equality and diversity in football boardrooms. The key step, however, is a decision to fully endorse the idea of an independent regulator. The government has previously supported the idea in principle but there has been sustained lobbying from the Football Association and the Premier League, both of which want to keep governance effectively in house. While Crouch wrote in her review that she believed the FA could one day take on the role of regulator, she said the governing body of the game in England would have to undergo substantial reform itself first. The government appears to have come to agree with this view. The independent regulator’s primary role will be to maintain financial stability within the English game. It will have oversight of club finances and will have information-gathering, investigation and enforcement powers. Rules recently announced by Uefa, which would limit clubs in European competition to spending no more than 70% of revenues on player costs, are likely to be implemented across the English game. Furthermore the regulator will take on the responsibility of assessing owners’ suitability to run clubs. A new test for all club owners will be applied not only when an individual buys a club but thereafter. It will, according to government sources, also include an “integrity test” that could extend to investigating owners’ business links, as well as their prior actions. There is also a proposal for greater due diligence on the source of an owner’s money at the point of buying a club. Many of the new measures are already standard in other industries so Monday’s announcement will come with a degree of implied criticism for English football’s leadership. The government has commissioned its own research into club finances that is expected to show unsustainable business practices are widespread within the club game. One key decision that could improve stability within football, however, redistribution of wealth across the English pyramid, is expected to be left to clubs themselves to decide. The news comes 48 hours after the government launched a full-scale review of women’s football in England. Another idea recommended by Crouch, it will take on the primary task of looking at ways to increase parity with the men’s game, and further sustain growth in the professional and grassroots women’s game. The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, said: “Football is nothing without its fans and for too long the football authorities have collectively been unable to tackle some of the biggest issues in the game. “The government took decisive action to conduct the fan-led review and today we have endorsed every one of its 10 strategic recommendations and the approach set out by Tracey Crouch. “We are now committed to fundamental reform, putting football on a more sustainable financial path, strengthening corporate governance of clubs and increasing the influence fans have in the running of the national game.”",Sport/Football,Main proposals of fan-led review of English football backed by government,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/25/main-proposals-of-fan-led-review-of-english-football-backed-by-government
