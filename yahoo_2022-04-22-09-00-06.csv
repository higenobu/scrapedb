4/22/2022,"United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said customers who don't want to fly without a mask mandate can get a refund. Kirby said United has a flexible change policy and most tickets types allow the fare to be applied to future travel. A United spokesperson said travelers should call customer service for more information. Travelers who are uneasy about flying without mask requirements may be able to get their money back if they opt to cancel a trip with United. United CEO Scott Kirby told The Today Show on Thursday that the airline is prepared to give refunds or flight credits to customers who no longer want to fly after a federal judge struck down the mask mandate for airplanes and public transit on Monday. United is one of several airlines that have since opted to make masks optional for flyers since the ruling. ""All of our customers should feel free to wear a mask and many of them are,"" Kirby said. ""For customers like that, that are immunocompromised or that have other concerns or issues, we are working with those customers if they really don't want to fly."" United spokesperson Josh Freed told Insider that travelers seeking a credit or refund do not need a reason to make a change or cancel their flight, such as being immunocompromised or having a child under 5. These customers should ""call customer service to find a good answer for their situation,"" he said. Freed did not specifically confirm a refund will be an option in all cases, but emphasized United's flexible change policy, adding ""most ticket types allow customers to apply their fare to travel through the end of 2023."" Basic economy tickets do not allow changes, though. They can, however, be canceled for a fee with the remaining balance kept as flight credit, or the ticket can be upgraded to standard economy for a fee and then be changed, The Points Guy reported. United's decision comes as many travelers voice concern over the safety of maskless flights, though Kirby said he doubts the mandate will return ""anytime in the foreseeable future."" In response to the policy, several consumers took to social media to air their grievances this week. ""Mask mandate or not, wearing an N95 on planes and in other enclosed public spaces helps protect yourself and others from Covid-19,"" Psychiatrist Benjamin Venesss wrote on Twitter. ""I don't want to get sick, but also there are two elderly people opposite me; if I'm an asymptomatic carrier, I don't want to risk infecting them."" Dr. Emily Ricotta, a Baltimore-based epidemiologist, expressed similar sentiments on Twitter, writing she was double-masking on her Thursday flight. Despite the worry, Kirby told Today that planes and airports are two of the safest places to be in terms of COVID-19 because of the highly effective air filters. Still, he assured customers who don't want to fly will be given options.

4/22/2022,"There's no doubt about it: Soaring mortgage rates are an economic shock to the U.S. housing market. Over the past month alone, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has spiked from 3.11% to 5.11%. It's both pricing out some stretched homebuyers and causing some would-be borrowers to lose their mortgage eligibility. The swift move up in mortgage rates also has research firms re-gearing their housing forecast models. Heading into 2022, real estate research firms presumed the Federal Reserve would put upward pressure on rates—but not like this. On the year, the Mortgage Bankers Association forecasted the average 30-year fixed rate would climb to 4%, while Fannie Mae forecasted a 3.3% mortgage rate by year's end. We blew past those estimates weeks ago. Now, real estate researchers are dialing down their home price forecasts. On Wednesday, Zillow researchers released a revised forecast, predicting that U.S. home prices would rise 14.9% between March 2022 and March 2023. That's down 2.9 percentage points from last month, when Zillow said home prices would shoot up 17.8% over the coming year. ""Driving the downwardly revised forecast are affordability headwinds that have strengthened faster than expected, largely due to sharp increases in mortgage rates,"" wrote the Zillow researchers. ""Further risks to the outlook as well: Inventory levels remain near record lows, but have the potential to recover faster than anticipated, which could lower future price and sales volume projections."" The fact Zillow has cut its forecast shouldn't come as a surprise. After all, this swift move up in rates is creating a serious affordability crunch for homebuyers. At a 3.11% fixed mortgage rate in December, a borrower would owe a principal and interest payment of $2,138 on a $500,000 mortgage. That payment would spike to $2,718 if taken out at a 5.11% rate. Over the course of the 30-year loan, that's an additional $208,800. If Zillow is right and home prices do rise another 14.9% over the coming 12 months, it'd mark another historically strong year for home price growth. Over the past 12 months, home prices are up a staggering 19.2%. Each of those figures are outliers compared to average annual U.S. home price growth of 4.6% posted since 1987. ""Even with the downward revision from last month, these figures would represent a remarkably competitive housing market in the coming year,"" writes the Zillow researchers. But not everyone is as bullish as Zillow. Over the coming year, CoreLogic predicts that home prices are set to decelerate to a 5% rate of growth. The Mortgage Bankers Association says home prices are poised to rise 4.8% over the coming 12 months, while Fannie Mae predicts home prices will rise 11.2% this year, and 4.2% in 2023. Of course, there's a chance they're all wrong. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas has already found signs that U.S. home price growth is greater than underlying economic fundamentals would push it up. The title of the Dallas Fed paper is blunt: ""Real-time market monitoring finds signs of brewing U.S. housing bubble."" ""Our evidence points to abnormal U.S. housing market behavior for the first time since the boom of the early 2000s. Reasons for concern are clear in certain economic indicators...prices appear increasingly out of step with fundamentals,"" wrote the Dallas Fed researchers. While CoreLogic says a housing market correction is unlikely over the coming year, the research firm does say most housing markets across the country are overpriced. The firm calculated a market risk assessment for nearly 400 metropolitan statistical areas. The finding? CoreLogic deems 65% of U.S. regional housing markets to be ""overvalued."" Both homebuyers and home sellers alike might want to take housing forecasts with a grain of salt. Look no further than the housing forecasts published during the COVID-19 recession. In the spring of 2020, both Zillow and CoreLogic published economic models predicting that U.S. home prices would fall by spring 2021. That price drop never came. Instead, the housing market went on a historic run that continues to today. Follow @Newslambert on Twitter to see new housing forecasts as they are released.

4/22/2022,"Between where a 16-year-old Lauderhill girl got off the school bus and her home, police say she was forced to survive a box cutter put to her throat before being raped in a driveway last week. Police say the “calm demeanor and the manner in which he preyed upon the victim” suggest the suspect has done this before. That suspect, 39-year-old Jermaine Henderson, a 5-foot-6, 220-pound Miramar resident, has been in Broward County Jail since Tuesday. He’s charged with two counts of sexual assault with a weapon, sexual battery on a victim over 12 years old. No bond has been granted. Henderson bonded out after a 2019 misdemeanor arrest then forfeited that bond by not showing up for his arraignment. Henderson also had two civil writs of arrest for being in arrears on child support, according to his online jail records. The arrest warrant says the 16-year-old girl looked at a photo array and “pointed at the photo depicting Henderson while repeating ’That’s him,’ ” multiple times. The arrest warrant says the 16-year-old got off the school bus near the corner of Northwest 38th Avenue and Sixth Street and headed home around 4 p.m. on April 11. Surveillance video from a nearby home released by Lauderhill police shows the girl walking down the street as a white pickup truck pulls into a driveway in front of her. A man stops the girl and talks to her. The warrant says the victim described the man as heavy-set with hazel eyes, a beard, brush cut hair, around 5-foot-6 to 5-foot-7, wearing an orange construction shirt, work boots and khaki pants. She said he told her she got “from point A to point B pretty fast” and asked her if she was on the track team. He then asked if he could check out the multi-colored Crocs she was wearing. She put one up on the truck’s tailgate. He grabbed her ankle, she said, and put a box cutter to it. He told her to follow his orders and she wouldn’t get hurt. He then put the box cutter to her throat and walked her to the open front passenger side door. After opening the rear passenger side door to conceal them from casual passers-by, she said, the man raped her. The bleeding girl subsequently went to HCA Westside Hospital for treatment, met with Plantation and Lauderhill police officers, described the truck, then to the Sexual Assault Treatment Center for examination and a rape kit. Two days later, the warrant says, detectives went door-to-door in the neighborhood after walking through it with the 16-year-old, who remembered details such as where she crossed the street after getting off the bus and why she crossed where she did. On April 14, a resident emailed police that her surveillance video picked up something. After police viewed the surveillance video, a license plate reader search found a 2008 white Ford F-250 pickup truck with paper license tag DDI2994 later changed to a regular tag 28BMDQ. It was owned by a Plantation man who also appeared on a Plantation police department report from April 12. The truck’s owner had gone with a friend to USA Tires International to complain about work done on the truck and the disagreement got heated enough for Plantation police to be called. The friend actually had been the one to bring the truck in for work. The friend, the warrant said, was Jermaine Henderson.",U.S./Miami Herald,"A 16-year-old girl was raped in a driveway after school bus drop-off in Broward, cops say",https://news.yahoo.com/16-old-girl-raped-driveway-214518940.html
4/22/2022,"What’s more American than Sunday night football? According to one Utah college, hardcore pornography. Westminster College, a private institution in Salt Lake City, is facing backlash over a porn course being offered this year. “Hardcore pornography is as American as apple pie and more popular than Sunday night football,” the course description reads. The class is listed as one of the film courses available at the school where students will analyze “this billion-dollar industry is as both a cultural phenomenon that reflects and reinforces sexual inequalities,” according to the course’s description. Students can expect to watch pornographic films in class, according to the college, and “discuss the sexualization of race, class, and gender and as an experimental, radical art form.” The instructor of the course, Eileen Chanza Torres, told ABC4 that the course is meant to be critical of pornography and not for her students to “watch porn, giggle and go home.” “Westminster College occasionally offers elective courses like this as an opportunity to analyze social issues. As part of this analysis, Westminster College and universities across the county often examine potentially offensive topics like pornography to further understand their pervasiveness and impact,” the school said in a statement to KSL TV. “Descriptions of these courses, while alarming to some readers, help students decide if they wish to engage in serious investigation of controversial subjects.” Westminster College did not immediately respond to a request for comment from McClatchy News on April 21. The course is an elective, meaning that students do not have to take the class, according to the university. A petition to remove the class has been signed by more than 450 people as of April 21. The petition claims that “these are not Utah values” and that this “creates an unsafe environment for students and faculty and normalizes pornography in culture.” Principal told girls to follow dress code or boys might touch them, students in WV say Professor who refused to use student’s pronouns wins $400K lawsuit with Ohio college Viral TikTok prompts Indiana school to review use of Native American ritual at games Professor called police on students arriving late to class, Georgia university confirms",U.S./Idaho Statesman,Hardcore porn class offered to students at Utah college. ‘As American as apple pie’,https://news.yahoo.com/hardcore-porn-class-offered-students-211506732.html
