1/7/2022,"Jürgen Klopp is hoping to fill the sizeable gap in his Liverpool frontline by signing the nifty Porto forward Luis Díaz. With Sadio Mané and Mo Salah away at the Africa Cup of Nations, the 24-year-old is seen as just the right kind of pesky menace to help Diogo Jota and Divock Origi in attack as Liverpool try to keep sight of Manchester City’s coattails through January in the Premier League. The word is that the Colombian, who impressed Klopp in two appearances against Liverpool in this year’s Champions League, would cost around £60m. Liverpool will have around £12m to put towards the transfer fee when they sell their granite-headed centre-back Nat Phillips, with Watford leading that particular race. The Hornets will have a gap to fill in defence after telling Danny Rose to clear his locker and head further north if he likes.  Having scooped up Kieran Trippier from Atlético Madrid, Newcastle’s Saudi-led owners are hoping to waft enough riyal in the faces of West Ham beancounters so that they part with 24-year-old France centre-back Issa Diop. They’ll also try to convince Todd Cantwell to swap a relegation battle at Norwich for a more luxurious scrap at St James’ Park, with the proviso that he will have to do Jonjo Shelvey’s running for him. Attempts to sign Liverpool legend Origi look to be over, though, with Bournemouth’s Dominic Solanke a preferred option as back-up for the injured Callum Wilson. Rafa Benítez’s attempts to rebuild his 2017-18 Newcastle team at Everton have been scuppered after a bid for Sean Longstaff was rejected. The midfielder is out of contract at the end of the season but Newcastle are keen to get him signed up again and aren’t exactly lacking in the resources to do that. Benítez may turn his attention to Lyon’s Bruno Guimarães instead, though Arsenal appear to be in the box seat to sign the 24-year-old holding midfielder. Over at Manchester United, the word is that Cristiano Ronaldo will take his #CR7 brand to another club if he does not approve of the next poor soul to follow interim manager Ralf Rangnick. Mauricio Pochettino is desperate to take on that challenge as he can’t wait to get away from the PSG circus but Ajax’s Erik ten Hag appears to be first-choice and Ed Woodward is keen to seal the deal before he leaves Old Trafford in February. Having bullishly announced that Barcelona “are back”, club president Joan Laporta made some noises about snaffling goal-addict Erling Haaland away from Borussia Dortmund. The reality is that goal-starved Anthony Martial is a more likely option on loan from Manchester United and they may have to do battle with Newcastle for him. Barcelona also have Philippe Coutinho on Aston Villa’s wage bill now instead of their own too. Leicester have £33m at the ready and will hit the button just as soon as they can to bring the Club Brugge striker Charles de Ketelaere to the King Power Stadium. The 20-year-old midfielder has scored nine goals already this season but could be so good that Real Madrid come in for him and duly ruin his career. And Tottenham are readying a bid for Wolves’ rampant winger Adama Traoré, with Antonio Conte keen to install the 25-year-old at right wing-back.",Sport/Football,Football transfer rumours: Liverpool to sign Porto’s Luis Díaz for £60m?,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/07/football-transfer-rumours-liverpool-to-sign-porto-luis-diaz-for-60m
1/7/2022,"Aston Martin warned it would miss its annual profit target by about £15m after failing to deliver as many of its limited edition Valkyrie hypercar models to customers as planned. The British luxury car manufacturer said it had delivered 10 of the £2.5m vehicles in the fourth quarter, fewer than planned.  “The impact is timing only, all Aston Martin Valkyrie Coupes are sold and remain allocated to customers with significant deposits,” the company said in a full-year trading update. Lawrence Stroll, the executive chairman of Aston Martin Lagonda, said that the Valkyrie project had proved challenging since he “inherited” it when he led a consortium to buy the company in 2020. “We inherited a challenging project with Valkyrie but we are now producing these fabulous hypercars,” he said. The company said the profits from the delayed shipping of the vehicles, which had faced electrical problems, would be reflected in its profits over the next two years. The company said sales of its DBX sports utility vehicle, which is targeted at wealthy female customers, have been strong. It sold 3,001 of the vehicles, on which the company is pinning its recovery, last year, taking an estimated 20% share of the luxury SUV market. Overall, Aston Martin said that wholesale sales grew 82% to 6,182 last year, as the company changed strategy to limit the amount of cars it makes available for sale to increase its prestige status. “The evidence is there that our strategy is working, as retail sales are well ahead of wholesales supported by strong pricing and improving residual values,” Stroll said. “It is a very long time since the core business was in such good health as it is today.” Stroll said that the return to Formula One, part of his £500m rescue deal, had “significantly increased our brand exposure, perception and desirability”. He added that the completion of a first full year of DBX sales and new products, such as a “new generation of front-engine sports cars” coming in 2023, meant the company was on track to achieve its target of £2bn in revenues and £500m in adjusted profits by 2024-2025. Tobias Moers, the chief executive of Aston Martin, said there is “tremendous demand” for its limited edition cars, with the Aston Martin Valkyrie Spider two times oversubscribed by buyers since its launch in August. “Our core business delivered as planned while navigating a challenging external operating environment,” he said. “We have taken aggressive action on improving the efficiency and profitability of the business. Brand desirability is strong, with new customers being attracted to Aston Martin as we follow our demand-led, ultra-luxury business model.” The company said its cash balance at the end of the year was a better-than-expected £420m. Aston Martin reported a pre-tax loss of £98m in the three months to the end of September, as revenues jumped from £124m to £238m year on year for the quarter. Shares rose 2.5% on Friday morning.",News/Business,Aston Martin will miss profit target by £15m after Valkyrie delivery failings,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/07/aston-martin-miss-profit-target-by-15m-valkyrie-delivery-failings
1/7/2022,"The Ruby Princess cruise ship sparked concerns about a Covid-19 outbreak in San Francisco after a dozen passengers were reported to test positive. It is nearly two years since a Covid outbreak when the ship docked in Sydney resulting in over 900 infections and 28 deaths.  Local US media reported on Friday the ship docked in San Francisco on Thursday after a ten-day New Years celebration trip to Mexico and back, with concerns there had been a major Covid outbreak on board. A couple on board said there had been an outbreak among the performers on the cruise, NBC reported, leading to shows being cancelled and the couple isolating as a result. “It was kind of disturbing that there wasn’t more widespread announcements about that … I think the only reason they announced that is because the shows were cancelled,” Diane Castillo told NBC. Under a local mandate, 25% of the passengers were tested for Covid-19, and 12 came back positive. According to the San Francisco Chronicle there were 724 passengers on the ship. Princess Cruises reportedly said those passengers were asymptomatic and departed the cruise either by private transport or into hotel quarantine. The Port of San Francisco confirmed this arrangement in a statement to local reports. The US Center for Disease Control (CDC) reported the ship had met the yellow classification threshold for investigation, which is more than 0.1% or more passengers having Covid-19. The CDC said the investigation had been undertaken and the ship was now under observation. Guardian Australia has sought comment from Princess Cruises. A spokesperson told CBS the cruise was operating as a “vaccinated cruise” with rates close to 100% among guests and staff, negative tests needing to be provided, and rigorous cleaning on board. The company’s website says for cruises from the US and the UK, guests are required to have received their final dose of an authorised Covid vaccine at least 14 days prior to the cruise beginning, and proof of a negative test either PCR or antigen in the United States, or a free test at the port in the UK. Passengers are also required to wear a face mask indoors at all times, and outdoors when physical distancing can’t be maintained. San Francisco reported 1,803 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday, with the city experiencing a significant rise in cases that is also being seen in many other parts of the world. While a handful of cases on a cruise ship might not have too much of an impact on overall Covid-19 transmission in San Francisco’s Bay Area, the outbreak does draw attention back to the role cruise ships had in spreading Covid-19 across the globe in the early days of the pandemic in 2020. The Ruby Princess itself became notorious for spreading Covid-19 in Sydney at the start of the pandemic. The ship was deemed “low risk” at the time by NSW health officials and was allowed to dock on 19 March 2020. All its passengers were allowed to disembark and travel interstate and overseas. This in turn lead to over 900 cases of Covid-19 and 28 deaths. An inquiry into the debacle ultimately found that there were “no systemic failures to address” and there were no repercussions for the decision makers involved. The then-premier of NSW, Gladys Berejiklian ultimately apologised unreservedly “to anybody who suffered as a result of the mistakes … undertaken by individuals within the health department or the health agency.”",News/Australia news,Ruby Princess sparks Covid concerns after a dozen passengers reportedly test positive in US,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/07/ruby-princess-sparks-covid-concerns-after-a-dozen-passengers-reportedly-test-positive-in-us
1/7/2022,"My earliest reading memoryMy mum reading me Ladybird books, in Dollis Hill, north-west London, in 1971. Reading for myself began with comics, mainly the Beano, Whizzer and Chips, and in our house, The Broons and Oor Wullie, not because we’re Scottish but because my mum collected kids’ books and annuals from everywhere. My favourite book growing upThe Billy Bunter books. This is again to do with my mum being a collector, as they were written in the 1920s and 30s, and so out of date, even in the 70s, but she foisted them on me. And from the perspective of Dollis Hill in 1973, the crumpet-toasting adventures at Greyfriars School felt exciting. I became a fan and joined a Frank Richards appreciation society, The Old Boys’ Book Club, where I was 11 and everyone else was 80. I imagine if I returned to these books now they’d be a hive of racism, classism and body fascism, so I won’t.  The book that changed me as a teenagerWays of Seeing by John Berger, at 18. It introduced me to the idea that what we assume to be natural is often ideological. In the book, this is primarily about art(particularly how images of women in art are utterly encoded with the male gaze) but I took from it an understanding that nearly everything we create, indeed think, has an underlying unconscious ideological component. The writer who changed my mindJohn Updike. Again when I was 18, I read it without realising it was part of a sequence of books, Rabbit Is Rich. It converted me to the idea that, as Updike puts it, the job of art is to give the mundane its beautiful due – that if you are a good enough writer, your prose can make everything, even the most microscopic and ordinary things in life, rich and strange. The book I came back toI’m presently reading, or rather listening to, The Wings of the Dove by Henry James. I read a fair amount of James, particularly when I was doing a PhD in Victorian literature and sexuality, but although I found him interesting, I also found him soulless and convoluted. Now it’s clear to me that James was inventing psychological modernity in the novel. And to do that he’s prepared to go sentence after sentence refining complexities of mood and thought and expression. It’s hard but kind of thrilling. The book I rereadGeorge Eliot’s Middlemarch. I read it in my 20s and thought: meh. Now, in my late 50s, I think – unoriginally – it is indeed the greatest novel written in English. I can hear all of Eliot’s yearning and pain and nuance about time and tide and marriage and compromise and the pressure of the social order. It has passages of intense beauty, and also – in a way she never quite managed elsewhere – the most satisfying and elegant structure of all great books. The book I could never read againI imagine I wouldn’t like the Whizzer and Chips Annual quite as much as I did back then. The book I am currently readingI do have, in actual book form, waiting for me The Every by Dave Eggers. I very much liked The Circle, which I thought was ahead of the game about what the internet is doing to us, so I’m keen to read the sequel, if my eyes allow me. My comfort readI’m writing a book about atheism and have ordered a text of the Barcelona Disputation of 1263, which was a debate between a rabbi and a friar organised by King James of Aragon about who’s right: Jews or Christians? Only one way to find out: The Inquisition, as it turns out. No doubt that’ll be lovely to cosy up to in front of the fire.

1/7/2022,"The true number of deaths from the Covid pandemic in the US are likely being undercounted, due to the long-lasting and little-understood effects of Covid infection and other deadly complications that surged during the past two years. “We are seeing right now the highest death rates we have ever seen in the history of this business,” J Scott Davison, CEO of insurance company OneAmerica, told journalists on 30 December.  “Death rates are up 40% over what they were pre-pandemic,” he said, among working-age people between 18 and 64. Deaths among older Americans have also increased, with one in 100 Americans over the age of 65 dying. There have been an estimated 942,431 excess deaths in the US since February 2020, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hispanic, Black and Native American and Alaska Native populations have been disproportionately affected with high death rates, research shows. The pandemic pales in comparison to other previous crises, Davison said. “A one-in-200-year catastrophe would be a 10% increase over pre-pandemic [levels]. So 40% is just unheard of.” Many of the deaths aren’t counted in the official Covid tally, he said, because they happen months after Covid infections. “The deaths that are being reported as Covid deaths greatly understate the actual death losses among working-age people from the pandemic. It may not all be Covid on their death certificates, but deaths are up in just huge, huge numbers.” In addition to deaths from Covid-19, drug overdoses – already one of the leading causes of death for working-age adults – and homicides have also risen during the pandemic. Insurers are also seeing a rise in disability claims – at first for short-term disability and now for long-term disability, because of both long Covid and delayed care for other illnesses, “because people haven’t been able to get the health care that they need because the hospitals are overrun”, Davison said. It’s a trend ”consistent across every player in the business” of insurance. Deaths from long Covid have been particularly difficult to track, because the virus may no longer be present at the time of death, but it weakened organs or created fatal new ailments. “We’re seeing the statistics get written as we go, almost,” Micah Pollak, associate professor of economics at Indiana University Northwest, said. And high rates of mortality and disability will only continue as more people get infected, he said. “We really don’t know what the tail of this thing looks like,” Pollak said of long Covid. “The further you get out [from infection], the longer time you have to potentially develop some kind of complications.” The high rates of death haven’t surprised him, Pollak said, given the equally high rates of cases and the unknown effects of a novel virus. “There’s just so much evidence of these long-term effects of Covid that I naturally assumed people realized that, hey, we’re gonna see probably a lot of deaths down the road – not necessarily soon after infection, but indirectly as a result of infection, as well as not just deaths but disability.” He expects these losses to continue as the pandemic surges and hospitals pass their breaking points. “People say that we’re on the verge of the healthcare system collapsing and things like that, and I think we’re probably past that point,” Pollak said. “We don’t really know what’s going to happen in the next month or so as all these Omicron cases hit the healthcare system.” The crush of the latest surge is adding to two years of overload and burnout, which could have serious long-term implications for healthcare. “We’re going to come out of this with a healthcare system just incredibly diminished because of what it’s gone through,” Pollak said. “W​e have some very serious long-term consequences for our health care system that, if we don’t address them, you’re going to see more sickness, more preventable illnesses, whether it’s Covid or otherwise, showing up in the population that we just can’t deal with.” The economic fallout from the pandemic will probably be felt for years to come, with continued workforce shortages that are already being felt. “This worker shortage that we’re experiencing is not going to go away,” Pollak said. In addition to the large numbers of people dying, many are becoming disabled – making it difficult for them and their caregivers to work other jobs. “In the US especially, we just don’t have very good childcare benefits, elder care benefits, family care benefits,” Pollak said. “And as long as we don’t have those things, people are going to be making the choice to exit the workforce, if they can, to provide those services.”",News/US news,"True number of Covid deaths in the US likely undercounted, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/07/true-number-covid-deaths-us-likely-undercounted-experts

The promiseThis cheap, at-home hack could turn a sad hair day into a joyful one. But is smelling like laundry worth it?  The testThere’s nothing like a trend from your teens being hailed as a “new” hair miracle to make you feel ancient. Unbelievably, the science behind this hack makes sense. Tumble dried sheets are positively charged, and our hair negatively charged, so the sheets help eliminate static hair – and the conditioner in the sheets smooths it down. The method is delightfully simple. Before heading on a night out, I took a dryer sheet and glided it down my hair for instant smoothing. I even stowed one in my bag, and three margaritas later was rubbing it on anyone in my path. But as a friend noted, they do make you smell like fabric softener. When I tried it again, hungover the next day, I felt the conditioner from the sheet rubbing off on my hands like a slightly greasy, “meadow fresh” film. The verdictI can’t deny this works. But sadly, the sheets are mostly non-biodegradable. Try a tiny bit of hair moisturiser instead, like Aveda Nutriplenish Daily Moisturizing Treatment (£29.50), which smoothes and defeats static – without making you smell like a laundry basket.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Can tumble dryer sheets sort your hair out?,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/07/beauty-hacks-can-tumble-drier-sheets-remove-static-from-hair

The culture minister, Chris Philp, told MPs the “more we hear the national anthem sung, frankly, the better” in response to a suggestion from a Conservative colleague for the Beeb to play it at the end of their programming for the day.  The BBC already plays the national anthem at the end of every day on Radio 4. Andrew Rosindell, the Tory MP for Romford, told the Commons on Thursday: “I know the minister will agree that the singing of the national anthem is something that provides great sense of unity and pride in our nation. “So in this year of the Queen’s platinum jubilee, will the minister take steps to encourage public broadcasters to play the national anthem and ensure the BBC restores it at the end of the day’s programming before it switches to News 24?” The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, could be heard saying “fantastic” after Rosindell’s question. Philp added: “We fully support the singing of the national anthem, Her Majesty the Queen and other expressions of patriotism – including the flying of the union jack. “The more that we hear the national anthem sung, frankly, the better. Organisations like schools are free to promote it and the more we can do in this area, the better it’ll be.” The proposal was swiftly ridiculed online, with social media users telling him to get his priorities straight.

1/7/2022,"There was “nothing untoward” in the prime minister discussing a proposed “great exhibition” with a Conservative donor who was helping to fund his Downing Street flat refurbishment, a minister has argued. WhatsApp messages released on Thursday showed that Boris Johnson discussed the proposal with Lord Brownlow at the same time as requesting his help with the £112,000 revamp of his official residence at No 11, with the conversation leading to a meeting between the peer and the then culture secretary, Oliver Dowden.  Asked whether the conversation about a “Great Exhibition 2.0” amounted to corruption, the small business minister, Paul Scully, told Times Radio. He said: “Ministers get proposals all the time and what rightly happened was that this got pushed on to the Culture, Media and Sport Department (DCMS) where it sits. “Lord Brownlow made his own approaches and it wouldn’t have just gone to the prime minister, but the important thing is it’s not gone ahead … so there’s nothing untoward that’s happening out of, you know, a few lines in a WhatsApp.” Downing Street said the proposal for Great Exhibition 2.0 was not taken forward although the government is going ahead with Festival UK, which was first announced in 2018. However, ministerial records show that only two months after Johnson’s exchanges with Brownlow, the peer attended a meeting with Dowden to discuss the proposal. Labour said that if Brownlow had access to senior ministers because he was footing the bill for the refurbishment work it was “corruption plain and simple”. On Thursday, Johnson was forced to issue a “humble and sincere apology” to his standards adviser, Christopher Geidt, after he failed to inform him of the exchange with Brownlow when he carried out an investigation into the funding of work last year. Johnson said he did not recall the exchanges and that the messages were on an old mobile phone, which he no longer had access to because the phone number was published on the website Popbitch. Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said: “It appears that Lord Brownlow had access to the prime minister and culture secretary because he was paying for his luxury flat renovations. “It is pretty unbelievable that Boris Johnson didn’t know who was paying for his luxury flat renovations. If so, that is corruption plain and simple. No one should be able to buy access or exchange wallpaper for festivals. Boris Johnson has serious questions to answer.” In a statement, a No 10 spokesman said: “All prime ministers and ministers have proposals put to them at various points and ministers also meet stakeholders regularly as part of their engagement on an array of issues. “In line with normal practice, this idea was referred to the relevant department, considered and ultimately not taken forward by the government. “The government is taking forward Festival UK this year, which was confirmed in 2018, reaffirmed in the 2019 manifesto and is a cultural programme of events, called ‘Unboxed’, on arts, design and technology which will span the whole of the UK.”",News/Politics,"‘Nothing untoward’ in Johnson’s ‘great exhibition’ texts, says minister",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/07/nothing-untoward-johnson-great-exhibition-texts-tory-donor

As the country deals with a massive rise in case numbers due to the spread of the Omicron variant, with more than 78,000 Covid cases reported in a single day on Friday, Frydenberg tweeted the news that he had joined the statistics.  “Like thousands of Australians, I tested positive today to Covid-19.

1/7/2022,"With the French presidential campaign under way, one of the country’s most provocative writers, Michel Houellebecq, is back with a novel closely linked to the forthcoming election. The 65-year-old author of Atomised and Platform releases the French edition of his 730-page novel Anéantir (Destroy) on Friday, with a sizeable first print run of 300,000 copies. Anéantir begins during a fictional presidential election campaign in 2027. Marine Le Pen has stepped down as leader of the National Rally but far-right candidate Éric Zemmour is still sparking controversy. President Emmanuel Macron is another real-life figure who, while not named, seems to feature, as is Bruno Le Maire, the current economy minister. Le Maire, a friend of Houellebecq, is the inspiration for Bruno Juge, one of the story’s protagonists.  Juge is critical of the outgoing president (implied to be based on Macron), at one point declaring that the head of state “has one political conviction and one only … ‘I was made to be president.’” After two terms of this leader, Houellebecq presents a country that is on its knees, with high levels of unemployment and poverty. Previous satires by Houellebecq are thought to have had an influence on French politics. In his 2015 bestseller Submission, France elects a Muslim president, and the novel stirred up the fears of an Islamist takeover of France. (When asked by the Guardian at the time if he was Islamophobic, the author responded “probably”.) And his 2019 novel Serotonin, which criticised globalisation and the EU – Houellebecq is known to be fiercely Eurosceptic – seemed to predict the Yellow Vest movement. Reviews of Anéantir have largely been positive so far. Le Monde calls it a “political thriller that veers into metaphysical meditation”, although L’Obs magazine thought it was too long and described it as “a yawn”.",Arts/Books, Michel Houellebecq envisages 2027 French election in latest novel Destroy,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/07/michel-houellebecq-french-election-latest-novel-eric-zemmour
1/7/2022,"Rare bats that are breeding in south-east England for the first time in a century will be encouraged to rear their young in an innovative maternity unit – a tumbledown stable block. The derelict stables at a secret location in Sussex will next month be purchased for greater horseshoe bats by the Vincent Wildlife Trust and Sussex Bat Group after the endangered species was discovered breeding in region after a 100-year absence.  The protection of the stables comes after the remarkable return to Sussex of Britain’s rarest bat. The only known greater mouse-eared bat in the country has been rediscovered in a disused railway tunnel, two years after it was previously spotted. The 19-year-old greater mouse-eared bat – whose solitary life inspired a play – was assumed to be dead after it disappeared from the hibernation spot where it had been found each winter since 2002. But the venerable creature – whose wings can stretch to nearly half a metre in flight – was rediscovered during a bat count by enthusiasts shortly before Christmas. “It amazed me because we assumed it had run its course,” said Tony Hutson, of the Sussex Bat Group, who first discovered species. The adult male greater mouse-eared bat has never mated and for all of this century has been the sole representative of its species in Britain. According to experts, greater horseshoe bats and the greater mouse-eared bat are benefiting from climate change but may also be thriving in Sussex because of the spread of vineyards. Unlike many other bat species, the greater mouse-eared bat often feeds by swooping low and picking up beetles, and so may benefit from beetle-rich bare earth in organic or low-intensity vineyards, which are increasingly popular in Sussex. Research in Portugal has shown that the presence of bats around vineyards reduces pests that eat the vines and also lessens grape fungal infections caused by those pests. Fiona Matthews, a professor of environmental biology at the University of Sussex, is to supervise a PhD investigating relationships between bats and English vineyards. Matthews called on Natural England to investigate whether more greater mouse-eared bats were living undetected in their former range – the species was also once found in Dorset – and also consider reintroducing the species. “This individual bat is obviously getting quite geriatric now, it’s a fascinating thing, but I keep turning over in my head what could be done and why aren’t we doing more about this?” she said. “Given that we think Britain is probably going to become more suitable rather than less with climate change, why don’t we have a recovery programme for the greater mouse-eared bat? With climate change, we know this species is losing its range in southern Europe. They will probably need to move north for their survival. They are in northern France which is not that different and not that far away. Maybe they just need a helping hand across the Channel.” Matthews said the bat was known to roost in large roof spaces – in churches, stately homes and large barns – and genetic identification of bat droppings found in likely locations could detect if other individuals are at large. After decades of regional extinctions, the return of the rare greater horseshoe bat to south-east England has been boosted by the protection of its only known maternity roost east of Hampshire, with bat enthusiasts raising enough money to buy the £200,000 Victorian stable block where the animals were discovered rearing young in 2019. The Vincent Wildlife Trust and Sussex Bat Group must raise an additional £150,000 to repair the tumbledown block, install partitions for warmth and shelter, and ensure the air-flow and humidity is just right for the bats, which lost 90% of its population in the 20th century. Cameras will also be fitted so people can watch the maternity colony without disturbing it. The species’ recovery has been assisted by milder winters but also by the Vincent Wildlife Trust buying or leasing barns, churches and an old mill that house maternity roosts. It has 37 such “bat reserves” across Britain and Ireland, in which half the reviving population of 13,000 greater horseshoe bats raise their young. Lucy Rogers, the chief executive of the Vincent Wildlife Trust, said: “Buying one stable block seems like quite an extravagant thing but it’s not just the building – it’s bats returning to the whole of the south-east, and this is the most cost-effective and tried and tested way of making that happen. “We hope the colony will be safeguarded and can increase, and then we can work with partners and get some landscape-scale conservation going as well, which will enable this species to thrive in the wider area.”",News/Environment,Special maternity unit to be built for some of England’s rarest bats,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/07/special-maternity-unit-england-greater-horeshoe-bats-rarest-sussex
1/7/2022,"The newly erected statue of a grinning man with an enormous phallus has prompted delight and rage in an archaeological hotspot in northern Peru where it has been on show since the beginning of the year. Although perhaps not anatomically correct, the crimson fibreglass structure is a faithful representation of a ceramic vessel from Peru’s pre-Columbian Mochica culture, whose people lived in the region between 150 and 700 AD.  A 15-minute drive from the centre of the regional capital, Trujillo, the statue has already proved hugely popular with passers-by and tourists who pose beneath the 1.5-meter member for selfies. But despite its historical fidelity, the 9ft-tall fertility symbol has already been attacked by vandals who smashed a hole in the statue and reportedly fired shots in the air as they fled. Arturo Fernández Bazán, the mayor of Moche, the district named after the ancient culture, told local media: “At two in the morning three hooded criminals held a knife to the security guard’s neck to keep him from reacting or calling his colleagues on the radio, and two of them damaged the phallus.” The roadside monument to the ancient pre-Inca culture renowned for its sexually explicit ceramics has also drawn tourists, as the statue stands on the route between the imposing adobe temples of the sun and the moon, or the Huacas del Sol y la Luna. Fernández Bazán said he plans to erect up to 30 more statues representing the Mochica culture – about a third of them representing erotic acts or childbirth – along the archaeological circuit. “In our Mochica culture, these types of ceramics vessels were not considered erotic but represented the Godhead,” Fernández Bazán, who worked as a gynaecologist before entering local politics, told local media. “The [Ancient] Greeks had another type of representation. We have been more aggressive and more direct with our feelings,” he added. The statue has provoked diverse reactions posted on the Moche municipality Facebook page, some saying that they found the statue offensive or that it should not be viewed by children. Gisela Ortiz, Peru’s culture minister, said: “The idea that children shouldn’t see it or it’s too offensive belongs to the time of obscurantism.” She told the Guardian. “As Peruvians, we should all feel proud of our diverse heritage, including the sexual or erotic part, which is inherent to the human being.” She added while “nothing justifies the violence against the security guard”, she said greater efforts to explain the cultural significance of the statue to the local population could help avert further controversy.",News/World news,Peruvian statue’s giant penis thrills tourists but vandals are turned off,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/07/peru-statue-penis-phallic-symbol-tourists
1/7/2022,"A convoy of trucks laden with huge black granite rocks trundles along the dusty pathway as a group of villagers look on grimly. Every day more than 60 trucks take granite for export along this rugged road through Nyamakope village in the district of Mutoko, 90 miles east of Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare.  The air reverberates with blasts and heavy machinery noises as the mountain above the village is slowly reduced, slab by slab. Quarrying has been happening here since the 1980s. Mutoko stone is sought after for its lustre. It is a popular material for tombstones. An extension to the Danish royal library in Copenhagen, known as the Black Diamond, is clad in Mutoko granite. The Buja people who live here say that as mining companies extract wealth from the mountain, they leave behind a trail of damaged roads and bridges, hazardous pollutants and dirty air. Cracks can be seen on houses and blast debris is everywhere. Now 50 families in the village have been told by a Chinese mining company that they will have to leave their homes and land. People in four other villages in the district fear they will also lose their ancestral lands. Two families, including an 82-year-old villager and his wife, have already been relocated by Jinding mining company, which wants to build a polishing plant. “The 82-year-old man collapsed when he heard the news because he never anticipated it. He was later resuscitated at the hospital. This is how bad things are here,” says Claudine Mupereri*, 38. She says the man was told his house was within the area licensed to the mining company by the government. Zimbabwe’s Communal Areas Act gives the president power to decide the use of an area that makes up 40% of the country’s land, home to about 70% of the population. “These companies do not respect communities. If the government does not protect us, then where will we get the protection we need?” says Mupereri. Two other families were given $2,500 (£1,840) to rebuild their homes, but community leaders say this is insufficient. “There is uncertainty around this village. Right now, we do not have anyone willing to help us because our councillor does not want to help us. Anyone who dares to speak out is threatened. Whether they remove us or not, we are already scared to speak out,” says Anesu Nyamuzuwe*. The 40-year-old father of four fears losing five hectares (12 acres) of land, his only source of income. “I have a good farm with fertile soil. My farming always meets my household requirements. I had built a good home and I am close to Mutoko centre, so I am not sure if I will ever get such a piece of land again,” he says. “What is more important, investors or the villagers? We should have the right to reject these people from entering our community.” Jinding mining company in China could not be reached for comment. A manager and interpreter at the company’s plant in Mutoko says families who live within the 500 hectares the company is licensed to mine will be relocated, but adds: “the people who are giving out the claims [to mining companies] have a problem. Why are they giving them [companies] so much land? This land is almost 500 hectares, I am sure they already know that people live in this place.” Zimbabwe has enjoyed a close relationship with China for decades. But the bond between the two countries solidified when western states imposed economic sanctions on Robert Mugabe’s government. As credit and investments dried up, China stepped in. In 2018, Zimbabwe-Chinese relations were elevated from “all-weather friends” to strategic partners, paving the way for Chinese investors to pour money into the country, particularly in the extractive industries, where they have been accused of paying little attention to environmental damage by environmental and human rights activists. Those living near granite mines say companies are failing to restore the land after extraction. Open pits are left uncovered, endangering children and wildlife. Zimbabwe’s government has been accused of turning a blind eye to complaints because, critics say, it doesn’t want to anger its biggest investor. Mineworkers speak of poor working conditions. At another mine in Mutoko, workers give accounts of beatings and poor pay. “Imagine going to work every day for over 12 hours and getting $50 at the end of it all. When I get home I am tired. My home knows no peace,” one worker tells the Guardian. “My friend was beaten with a steel rod and another 17-year-old boy had his arm broken after coming to work late. He was given $250 as compensation after villagers complained.” In 2020, two workers were shot and wounded in Gweru, central Zimbabwe, allegedly by a Chinese miner after a quarrel over salaries. Evelyn Kutyauripo, a paralegal with the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Association (Zela), who has been rallying villagers in Mutoko to resist evictions, says local officials need to protect people. “I blame the headmen and the councillors because they are working with the Chinese. They should stand with the community,” she says, adding that companies were taking from communities and not helping them develop. “They are not developing anything in the community. They should have a strong corporate social responsibility because they are killing our environment. We are suffering, our houses are cracking and there is pollution. The government should come to see what is happening.” Another Chinese mining company, Shanghau Haoying Mining Investments, is also causing unease among Nyamaropa villagers. Last year, the company was reportedly given a government licence to mine granite on tracts of land belonging to local people. “I hear they want to remove us so that they take the rock, which is underneath, but the people do not want to. They will have to use guns to remove us here,” says Gladman Murape*, 34. Shanghau could not be reached for comment. Richard Ncube, a legal officer at Zela, says people in Mutoko were “extremely worried” about evictions. “The major challenge is they are living in the dark, and they are not sure what is going to happen.” He said people were too scared to challenge the company. “We have gathered that most of the communities [in Mutoko] are afraid to come forward and take these matters to court due to intimidation and fear of being victimised,” says Ncube. Attempts to challenge the mining companies elsewhere in Zimbabwe have had mixed results. In November, Heijin mining company lost its mining licence in Murehwa, a district about 55 miles from Harare, after local leaders complained to the government that the company planned to evict locals. In 2020, Zela was involved in the successful fight to overturn licences to mine coal in Hwange national park, the country’s largest national park, home to 40,000 elephants. Following protests, the government banned mining in all its national parks.However, in September, hundreds of people in Chikomba district, 80 miles south of the capital, were evicted from their ancestral homes to make way for a $1bn iron and steel mining project. The Zimbabwe government says it has not received any reports of abuse of workers in Chinese-owned mines, but it did encourage workers to report any incidents. Deputy mines minister, Polite Kambamura, urged villagers to approach the ministry if they had problems. “We haven’t heard of any Chinese company which has relocated people in Mutoko. If villagers are not happy, they may approach our provincial mining office in Marondera or come directly to the ministry,” he says. “We understand that if ever there is a company that wants to relocate the people, they should engage the community, to buy that social licence from the community.” Kambamura adds that an environmental impact assessment – to ensure the environmental, social, economic and cultural issues related to any mining project are considered before it begins – must also be conducted by the company and should address any concerns. The Chinese embassy in Zimbabwe did not respond to numerous requests for comment. Mutoko leaders were also approached for comment. * Names have been changed Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",News/Global development,"‘They want to remove us and take the rock’, say Zimbabweans living near Chinese-owned mines",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/07/zimbabwe-china-mines-pollution-evictions
