4/8/2022,"The high-profile Bundaberg mayor, Jack Dempsey, has announced he will contest the federal election as an independent, running against the federal resources minister, Keith Pitt. Dempsey is a former Liberal National party state minister, who held the police and Indigenous affairs portfolios in the Newman government. He told the Guardian last month the LNP had become “obsessed by coal” and was out of step with regional people, a theme he built on in a statement announcing his candidacy. “As the minister for coal, Mr Pitt is out of touch with the local community on climate change, the housing crisis, flood mitigation and coal mining,” Dempsey said. Pitt holds the seat of Hinkler by a comfortable margin of 14.5%. The electorate stretches from Hervey Bay – an area where the population skews older, and which Labor unexpectedly won at the state election – to the regional city of Bundaberg, where Dempsey has served as mayor since 2016. He was the LNP state member for Bundaberg from 2006 to 2015. His candidacy has long been rumoured and throws out the form book in a seat the Coalition would have been expecting to hold comfortably. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Dempsey has in recent years taken several progressive positions, including opposition to a cashless welfare trial and issuing a formal apology for the historical practice of “blackbirding”. In his statement, Dempsey said the region had untapped agriculture potential that could turn around the local economy. “Hinkler is the food bowl of Australia and with positive change we’ll become the nation’s capital for agricultural technology and bio-energy,” Dempsey said. “It’s unacceptable that Hinkler continues to be one of the most socially disadvantaged parts of Australia.“It’s clear that after nine years in office that Keith Pitt has no ideas to boost employment and economic development, or to address inequality.” Dempsey said he will take leave from the council when the election is called. Pitt released a statement calling on him to resign. “It’s very clear that he hasn’t been interested in [his constituents] for quite some time,” Pitt said. “He’s been relentlessly pursuing a federal agenda for many months. “Who is paying for the mayor’s campaign? Has the mayor handed back his ratepayer-funded car and phone? Are council staff assisting on the mayor’s campaign? Who will his preferences go to? These are all questions ratepayers deserve an answer to.”  ",News/Australia news,‘Minister for coal’: Keith Pitt to face challenge from former LNP state minister Jack Dempsey,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/08/minister-for-coal-keith-pitt-to-face-challenge-from-former-lnp-state-minister-jack-dempsey
4/8/2022,"Dozens of evacuation orders have been issued for parts of south-west Sydney with the Hawkesbury and Nepean rivers expected to reach major flood levels on Friday. Water levels at the Upper Nepean River at Wallacia were tipped to exceed last month’s flood peak, while the Hawkesbury at North Richmond was expected to reach 10.5 metres by 10am, and as high as 11.8 metres at noon – just below the level seen in the devastating floods in February 2020. More than 150 schools across New South Wales have been closed, and residents have been ordered to evacuate houses and caravan parks. It follows a day of torrential rain across Sydney, parts of the south and central coasts, the Illawarra and Hunter regions and southern and central tablelands. Mona Vale on Sydney’s northern beaches received 74mm of rain in the 24 hours to 8am and nearby Cromer recorded 70mm. Showers continuing today but easing along the coast. The chance of 25 - 50mm for some coastal areas as well as inland parts. Chance of severe thunderstorms inland with heavy rain.Monitor warnings and check forecasts: https://t.co/Ss766eSCrL pic.twitter.com/e4A3Thf9lQ With rain falling on already saturated catchments, Warragamba Dam again spilled. The State Emergency Service conducted 38 flood rescues in the past 24 hours, and received 1,299 calls for assistance. There are currently 23 evacuation orders across NSW affecting 2,400 people, and a further 16 evacuation warnings affecting 1,700 people. “It’s really important that people in areas that are currently under evacuation orders and warnings are following the advice of emergency services,” SES spokesperson Adam Jones said. He warned that the danger had not faded for other parts of Sydney, with heavy rainfall and sodden ground combining to create a risk of flash flooding. “If it’s not essential to go out, just stay at home,” Jones said. A further 25mm to 50mm was expected to fall in coastal areas on Friday, with rain forecast from Lismore to the Victorian border. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Bureau of Meteorology said major flooding was likely along the Hawkesbury and Upper Nepean rivers, with moderate flooding in the Upper Colo River. A major flood peak above levels seen during the April 1988 floods was recorded at Menangle on Thursday afternoon, where the Nepean River reached 16.83 metres before falling back to 11.75 metres by 7am on Friday. Residents in Camden and Chipping Norton in Sydney’s south-west and Woronora, Bonnet Bay and Gronos Point were earlier ordered to evacuate as flood waters began to rise on Thursday. People were also warned to prepare for evacuation in parts of Ebenezer, Emu Plains, Mulgoa, Sackville North, Pitt Town Bottoms, Camden, Elderslie, Wallacia Weir and North Richmond. Three evacuation centres have opened in western Sydney. The commissioner of Resilience NSW, Shane Fitzsimmons, told Channel Nine that having to repeatedly evacuate due to flooding was “really taking a toll with people right across NSW”.",News/Australia news,Dozens of evacuation orders in place across NSW as rivers expected to reach major flood levels,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/08/nsw-weather-flood-warnings-evacuation-orders-flood-flooding-hawkesbury-nepean-river-schools-closed-sydney-rain-forecast
4/8/2022,"The Kremlin has admitted suffering “significant losses” of troops since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, in a rare admission of how badly the war has gone. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he hoped the besieged city of Mariupol would be “liberated from nationalistic battalions” sooner rather than later. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has highlighted the bravery of his nation in his latest late-night national address. “Being brave is our brand,” he said, while calling for bolder sanctions on Russia. He also claimed Russian troops were preparing “elaborate propaganda scenarios” to make it look like civilians they had killed in Mariupol were killed by Ukrainian soldiers. A Russian airstrike on a railway near Barvinkove station in Donetsk Oblast has blocked three evacuation trains from leaving, according to reports. Thousands of passengers who were meant to be evacuated on the trains have been placed at the station, according to the Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said 26 bodies had been found under two ruined buildings in Borodyanka, a town about 25km west of Bucha. She did not say if the authorities had established the cause of death, but accused Russian troops of carrying out airstrikes on the town, which is being searched by Ukrainian authorities after Russian troops occupying it withdrew. Ukraine is bracing for a renewed Russian offensive on its eastern front, as Russian forces withdraw from the shattered outskirts of Kyiv to regroup and intensify their attacks across the Donbas region. The Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said the besieged southern city of Mariupol was holding out and that he believed the Russian efforts to surround Ukrainian troops in the east would be in vain. The mayor of Mariupol, Vadym Boichenko, says more than 100,000 people still urgently need to be evacuated from the city. Speaking on national television, he described the situation in the Russian-besieged Ukrainian port city as a humanitarian catastrophe. Zelenskiy called on the Greek parliament to use its influence to rescue the remaining population in Mariupol, which has had large ethnic Greek populations for centuries. In his address, Zelenskiy said that the “Russian state and the Russian military are the greatest threat on the planet to freedom, to human security, to the concept of human rights.” In Mariupol, he said, “the same cruelty, the same heinous crimes” that occurred in Bucha and in the Kyiv region were being replicated, accusing Russian forces of re-staging the war to suit their country’s propaganda. The United Nations general assembly has voted to suspend Russia from the UN human rights council over reports of “gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights” by invading Russian troops in Ukraine. Ninety-three countries voted in favour of the US-led motion, while 24 countries voted against and 58 countries abstained. Russia will probably renew its attack on Kyiv if it succeeds in taking full control of the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, the deputy chief of staff of Ukraine’s ground forces, Oleksandr Hruzevych, said. The Ukrainian deputy defence minister, Hanna Malyar, earlier today warned that Russian forces were biding their time as Moscow ramped up intelligence operations there and learned how best to fight Ukrainian troops. The mayor of Dnipro, a city in central-eastern Ukraine, has urged women, children and elderly people to leave because fighting with Russia is expected to intensify in eastern regions. Filatov’s warnings follow similar calls by authorities in the Luhansk region, east of Dnipro. On Wednesday, the regional governor of Luhansk urged all residents to evacuate while they still could in relative safety. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said allies had agreed to strengthen support for Ukraine, and were providing “a wide range” of weapon systems, as well as cybersecurity assistance and equipment to protect against chemical and biological threats. There was no sign Vladimir Putin intended to pull back, he added. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, called for more heavy weaponry from western allies and “ruinous” sanctions against Moscow, warning: “Either you help us now – and I’m speaking about days, not weeks – or your help will come too late, and many people will die.” G7 foreign ministers condemned “in the strongest terms” the atrocities committed by Russian troops in Bucha and a number of other Ukrainian towns. In a joint statement, ministers spoke of “haunting” photographs of mutilated bodies, alleged executions and reports of sexual assaults by Russian troops. German intelligence agencies have intercepted radio messages from Russian soldiers discussing the killings of civilians in Ukraine, according to reports. Two separate communications are said to have been intercepted in which Russian soldiers describe how they question soldiers as well as civilians, and then proceed to shoot them, the Washington Post cited an intelligence official as saying. General Mark Milley, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, had grim warnings for the millions desperately hoping Putin sees sense and stop the attack on Ukraine. “It’s going to be a long slog,” Milley told the US Senate armed services committee in a hearing in Washington DC. Soldiers fighting for Ukraine appear to shoot a Russian prisoner of war outside a village west of Kyiv in a video posted online. The footage was originally shared on social media app Telegram. The New York Times said it had verified the video and the BBC said it had confirmed the location north of the town of Dmytrivka and found satellite images showing bodies on the ground. The Nobel laureate editor-in-chief of the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta was attacked with red paint while he was on a train, he said. The investigative newspaper had suspended publishing until the end of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, after Russia’s communications regulator warned them to cease their reporting. – Léonie Chao-Fong, Joanna Walters, Guardian staff",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 44 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/08/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-44-of-the-invasion
