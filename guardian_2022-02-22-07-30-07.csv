2/22/2022,"Days before a new legislative map for North Dakota was set to be introduced in the state house, leaders of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and Spirit Lake Nation sent a letter to the governor and other state lawmakers urging them to rethink the proposal. “All citizens deserve to have their voices heard and to be treated fairly and equally under the law,” they wrote, arguing that the proposed map was illegal, diluting the strength of their communities’ voice.  But instead, in early November, the Republican-controlled legislature approved the map, with only minor changes. And the Republican governor, Doug Burgum, quickly signed it. “Our voice is going to be muffled once again,” the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa chairman, Jamie Azure, told the Guardian. “It’s getting a little sickening, tell you the truth.” The nations have sued the state, alleging that the map, which was meant to account for population changes identified in the 2020 census, doesn’t comply with section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The lawsuit, filed earlier this month, claims the map packs some Indigenous voters into one House subdistrict, while putting other “nearby Native American voters into two other districts dominated by white voters who bloc vote against Native Americans’ preferred candidates”. It adds that complying with the Voting Rights Act would mean placing the two nations in a single district, where they would “comprise an effective, geographically compact majority”. Azure said: “We never want to enter into lawsuits; we never want to do these things. But, you know, at a certain point, the goodwill just goes out the window. And, you know, we’re tired of being disrespected. And that’s how we feel with this lawsuit.” North Dakota’s secretary of state, Al Jaeger, the top election official for the state, told the Guardian in an email that they do not comment on ongoing legal cases. Indigenous people in the US have faced generations of voting restrictions. Although Indigenous people were granted citizenship in 1924, it took more than three decades before they were considered eligible to vote in every state. Since then, they have continued to face a host of roadblocks in the form of scarce polling locations, lack of access to the internet and language barriers. The National Congress of American Indians reported that they have the lowest voter turnout in the country, with 34% of Indigenous people not registered to vote. In North Dakota, the state only recently reached a settlement with two nations over a law requiring voters to have a valid identification card with a home address (many homes on reservations don’t have a street address). The state ultimately agreed to allow Indigenous people to vote without a residential address. In this new case, the legislative map divides District 9, which includes Turtle Mountain, whose members tend to favor candidates on the political left, into two subdistricts. Since they have a majority in one subdistrict, but not the other, the result is the nation has one less House seat in which to elect their candidate of choice, explained Michael Carter, staff attorney at the Native American Rights Fund, one of the groups representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. It also moved the Spirit Lake Reservation to District 15, grouping it with counties farther north. Spirit Lake tribal members are also known for favoring progressive candidates, while this area tends to be more conservative, Carter explained. The result, he said, would be an Indigenous candidate of choice winning about 5% of the time. “This is just another one of those loopholes that they’re throwing around at us. But we have remedies for it. The remedy that is proposed would work for us and the state,” said the Spirit Lake Tribal chairman, Douglas Yankton, Sr, referring to the proposal to put both nations into a single district. Jean Schroedel, political science professor at Claremont Graduate University and author of Voting in Indian Country: The View from the Trenches, described the redistricting as a “violation in what has previously been the interpretations of section 2 of the Voting Rights Act”. But, she added, “the court seems to be moving very much away from that.” She cited the recent supreme court decision stating Alabama did not have to redraw its congressional map before the 2022 midterm elections despite a lower court ruling the map discriminated against Black people. North Dakota is home to five federally recognized nations, with American Indian and Alaska Native people making up about 6% of the state’s population. Some tribal members in the state do support the new map, as the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation in western North Dakota was placed in a subdistrict, as it requested. But for Yankton, who said committee members never came to the Spirit Lake or Turtle Mountain reservations during the redistricting process despite requests, the map is the latest voting rights injustice for Native people: “It’s violating our democratic right, as citizens of North Dakota, to participate and support people who choose to run for whatever offices. And it hinders us from even having a chance as Native Americans to run for offices.”",News/US news,Indigenous nations sue North Dakota over ‘sickening’ gerrymandering,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/21/native-american-tribes-sue-north-dakota-gerrymandering
2/22/2022,"Is it strange, or is it wrong, that I hadn’t thought of them in a while? Or is that, in fact, the way it should be? Should we let monsters endure in the memory or should we deny them as much space in our lives as we can? There was no sign that any such questions had been asked before or during the making of Channel 4’s new three-part documentary Moors Murders: The Witness, which dragged the heinous crimes of Ian Brady and Myra Hindley before us once again. I looked for a reason for it – the marking of some terrible anniversary, perhaps, or the beginning of a new search of Saddleworth Moor for Keith Bennett’s body, which remains the only one of the couple’s five victims not yet found. There seems to be none.  The hook on which the programme hangs is some “never before seen” letters from Brady and Hindley to Janie Jones. She had been serving a sentence for vice charges in HMP Holloway in the 1970s when Hindley was there, and potentially saved the latter’s life when she was attacked by another inmate. They stayed in touch after Jones was released. Over the years, as further evidence about Hindley’s involvement in the crimes emerged and the stories told to Jones became inconsistent, Jones started writing to Brady to try to collate facts. “My psychology was – I’d do one serial killer against the other,” says Jones, with a degree of sang-froid that begins to chill one’s own blood. It also features interview footage with David Smith (who died in 2012), Hindley’s brother-in-law and friend of Brady who witnessed the murder of Edward Evans and testified to it in court, helping to secure their convictions and life sentences. We hear the shocking story Smith told the court of Brady murdering 17-year-old Evans in front of him with an axe. Hindley had, it appears, deliberately brought Smith over to witness the killing so that Brady could have a hold over him. What they didn’t expect – a small but telling indication of their distance from normal morality – was that he would go home, tell his wife (Hindley’s sister, Maureen) what had happened and the next morning, when people were around and he felt safe, call the police and tell them everything. This basic tale, bleak in summary and bleaker in the telling of it, is padded out by interviews with Jones, readings from the letters and analysis by a psychologist and a criminologist that is so trite and unilluminating you wonder how far down the list of potential contributors the producers had to go to find someone willing to give their two penn’orth and whether this should not, at some point, have given them pause for thought about the value of the programme they were putting together. Because really, there is none. The letters only reinforce what we already know about the killers – that Brady (diagnosed as a psychopath in 1985 and an inhabitant of high-security Ashworth hospital until he died) was a mass of grandiose delusions, cruelties, manipulations and narcissism. Hindley refused to take any responsibility for her part in the murders no matter who she was talking to or how much she claimed to trust them, blaming Brady and his hold over her until the end. Smith was saying what he has already said, with purpose, in court half a century ago. It was as if somebody at Channel 4 had simply decided that enough time had passed to make it OK for us all to hear about it again. There is an argument that says silence can be complicity. If we don’t keep the knowledge of what terrible things people can do alive in collective and cultural memory, we risk allowing them to happen again. The counter-argument is that there comes a point when we have learned all we can from individual horrors such as Brady and Hindley, the foul but extraordinary outliers. And that by concentrating our attention on these singular and singularly extreme monsters, we allow ourselves to ignore greater but less spectacular, obvious horrors – rampant child abuse in the home, perhaps, endemic violence against women by “ordinary” men, or a police force so corrupted by misogyny and racism that it is barely fit for purpose, to name but the first few that immediately occur to me. To my mind, we have long stripped the Moors murders of anything valuable they can teach us. And that was never too much – you can safely say there has always been a consensus against child murder. Varying public attitudes towards male and female murderers are a known phenomenon and we move to arm ourselves against its unjust effects. To rake these murders up again at this point in history requires a strong justification to defend against charges of simple salaciousness, titillation or ratings-chasing. Perhaps this will emerge in the remaining two episodes. I hope so.",Arts/Television & radio,Moors Murders: The Witness review – these heinous crimes have nothing more to teach us,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/21/moors-murders-the-witness-review-these-heinous-crimes-have-nothing-more-to-teach-us
2/22/2022,"You couldn’t make it up. “Now was the time for personal responsibility,” said the prime minister with no sense of personal responsibility. His whole life has been conducted with a reckless disregard for other people. Boris Johnson is a man who has always done exactly what he wants, when he wants to do it, and has a trail of broken marriages and promises to prove it. When the rest of us mugs were doing our best to follow the letter of the rules that he made, he was busy enjoying himself at one party after another. And when he was caught, he didn’t have the decency to apologise. Instead he chose to brazen it out. Cheapening himself and his party still further. No matter. Do as I say, not as I do and all that. In any case the changes to the Covid rules that the Suspect was announcing in his Commons statement had little to do with what was scientifically proven. Rather it was to win over the libertarian rightwingers in the Tory party who had always been against any form of lockdown restrictions and on whom he was relying to support him through his ongoing Partygate difficulties.  So here was how Covid was going to work from now on. Basically we would be acting as if it was more or less over. After all, it certainly was for the 175,000 people who had died from the virus over the last two years and it was time for the rest of us to get with the programme. And if anyone was unlucky enough to get Covid then they should just knuckle down and do the right thing. Whatever that was. Johnson tugged at the toddler haircut. We were in a world of moral relativism. It might be fine for some to carry on as normal. That would be people who couldn’t afford tests and who would no longer have access to statutory sick pay from day one. They could work and infect vulnerable people. For others – that would be the better off – not so much. It turns out you can put a price on personal responsibility. Still, Omicron hadn’t turned out to be as bad as all that so it was time to end compulsory self-isolation, get rid of expensive test and trace programmes and see what happens. And if some of the elderly, vulnerable and unvaccinated died, then they died. They probably had it coming to them anyway and in any case they could all die happy knowing that life for the rest of the country would be free from health restrictions. There was one small caveat. Covid may not actually be over after all. It may return as a deadlier variant. In which case the decision to end all free testing could prove to be a huge advantage. Apparently. The Suspect hadn’t quite thought this one through. So he ad-libbed. We’d just be relying on the ONS survey to detect future Covid strains: even though there would be far fewer tests to detect them. There again, on the plus side, the fewer tests that were done, the fewer infections would be registered. Put this way, you could eliminate Covid completely by just stopping all testing. Why hadn’t he thought of that before? Understandably, Keir Starmer was less than impressed. While not against the idea of loosening restrictions in principle, he just wasn’t sure they didn’t have more to do with party management than the nation’s health. After all, they seemed to have been cobbled together at the last moment. So much so that the chancellor and the health secretary had been having a standup row over the cost of some of the changes that very morning. And judging by the frown on Sajid Javid’s face, the health secretary still wasn’t happy at having come off second best. The Suspect merely laughed this off and went out of his way to deliberately misinterpret what had been said. Either that or he’s dimmer than we thought. The Labour leader had grabbed the stick by the wrong end yet again, he said. Except he really hadn’t. Only Johnson didn’t care. No more than he did when other opposition MPs asked why it was that the World Health Organization and the British Medical Association weren’t backing the changes. Or that there were no safeguards to protect the clinically vulnerable from being infected by their carers. Or countless other serious objections to plans that had been made on the hoof. Just rely on personal responsibility. Said the man without any, repeatedly. Because this was all about him feeling the love from his own backbenchers. A national health policy designed only to please 250 or so Tory MPs. And in that it appeared to be wholly successful. Because not a single one found fault with a word he had said. The intellectually challenged Graham Brady sought guarantees there would be no more lockdowns. The equally intelligent Edward Leigh merely asked for a guarantee of no more lockdowns for ten years. The length of time he expected the Suspect to remain prime minister. Really. John Redwood wondered if the same ingenuity that Johnson had used on the pandemic could be applied to the cost of living crisis. That would be billions of pounds of state aid and several tax rises. So much for the free marketeers. But the prize for maximum stupidity and toadying went to Matt Hancock. He declared it was entirely down to Johnson’s self restraint and personal responsibility that the UK was now the first country to have seen the back of the pandemic. To think he was health secretary once. How badly must he want to be loved by Boris. The Suspect was rather more guarded in his later press conference – apart from insisting the country should be proud in ending restrictions: as proud as he had been to break them presumably – but then this time he was flanked by Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance. Both of whom seemed to think that Covid was far from over and that the measures that had been lifted could easily be reinstated at just a couple of week’s notice if a subsequent variant – and there would be variants, they were certain of that – proved to be more infectious and vaccine escaping. And as for self-isolating, it wasn’t a matter of personal responsibility, it was a national necessity, Johnson just stood there and sucked it up. He’d done what he set out to achieve in getting Tory MPs back on side and that was all that mattered. If he broke his promises and had to impose a further lockdown in nine months’ time because he’d screwed things up, then what the hell? He’d deal with that as and when. For now, as so often, he was just fighting for his life in the here and now. And under those circumstances, anything goes. Especially when you’ve no sense of personal responsibility.
