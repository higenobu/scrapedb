3/8/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- As equity markets sink around the world, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. strategists say a perfect storm looks to be gathering.

This is a potential “game-changer,” eroding their conviction on the prospects of risk assets, they wrote. Earnings delivery is “paramount” at a time when liquidity is being sucked out by central banks across the world, the Citi strategists said. “Removing this support could leave some indices floating on air.” A ferocious rally in developed market stocks came to an abrupt end at the start of this year amid concerns that record inflation readings will cause central banks to aggressively tighten policy. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered another spike in commodity prices, adding to fears that economies are heading to a stagflationary shock. Several major benchmark gauges across Europe have dropped more than 20% from their recent highs, while the S&P 500 is hovering around a 10% correction. With gas and oil prices soaring, Citi and Morgan Stanley strategists say “demand destruction” may now be unavoidable. Optimists Wavering “Any relief should be sold,” said Wilson. “We recommend staying defensively oriented by running less risk than normal and searching for companies with superior operational efficiency and earnings stability.” While the Morgan Stanley strategist has consistently been one of Wall Street’s most outspoken bears, even optimists are now wavering.

3/8/2022,"What do you get when you combine: a fading stock market, frozen central bank assets (including oligarchs), widespread credit downgrades, getting kicked off SWIFT, potential cyberattacks, spiking inflation, evaporating fiscal and monetary stimulus, and Fed interest rate hikes? In my opinion, the perfect recipe for collapse. DOW DAILY CHART: Stocks may be entering the sharp breakdown I’ve been forecasting. Strong downside follow-through that finishes below the February low (32,300) would confirm a repeat of the 2018 taper-tantrum and project a decline to 29,700 by March 25 (+/- a trading day). If selling accelerates faster than anticipated (very possible), then a trip to fill the open price gap at 28,500 becomes likely. I don’t like being so pessimistic, but things could get ugly over the next few weeks. Markets could plunge further than expected. If prices do plummet, I’ll be on the lookout for rare opportunities.

3/8/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Russia threatened to cut natural gas supplies to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline as part of its response to sanctions imposed over the invasion of Ukraine, a move that could heighten the turmoil in energy markets and drive consumer prices even higher. Most Read from Bloomberg Ukraine Update: Russia’s Gas Threat; Cease-Fire Talks Struggle China Warns U.S. Over Forming Pacific NATO, Backing Taiwan Biden to Sign Crypto Order as Firms Face Sanctions Pressure Covid Can Shrink the Brain as Much as a Decade of Aging, Study Finds Stakes Rise as Putin Says His War in Ukraine Will Continue Russia has the right to take actions that “mirror” the penalties imposed on the Russian economy, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak -- who’s also in charge of energy affairs -- said in a televised speech late Monday. He said no decision to shut off Nord Stream 1 has yet been taken, and the pipeline is currently operating “at its full capacity.” The comments come after a day of wild swings on European gas markets, with prices at one point surging by almost 80% amid fear of disruption to supplies from Russia. Europe’s reliance on Russian energy has been a key factor in efforts by the continent’s leaders to agree on how to respond to the invasion of Ukraine. Last month, Berlin shelved the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, and European Union officials say they’re working on a plan that could cut the bloc’s import needs from Russia by almost 80% this year. But many EU politicians remain wary of immediate action, one reason why Germany has pushed back against proposals for a ban on oil imports. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Monday that Russian oil and gas are of “essential importance” to the European economy. Roughly 40% of EU gas imports and one quarter of its oil come from Russia. Novak said that Russia has other options for selling its oil if the U.S. and EU ban Russian imports, and he warned that any such move could have “catastrophic consequences for the world market” with prices surging to $300 a barrel or more.

3/8/2022,"We’re closing in on two weeks since Russian forces invaded Ukraine, starting Europe’s largest land war since 1945. So far, the Western nations have avoided commitments to oppose Russian arms directly, and have responded by sending munitions and humanitarian aid to Ukraine while instituting sanctions against Russia. The situation is complicated by Russian’s position as a major producer in the global energy markets, and Europe’s increasing reliance in the past decade on Russian natural gas exports. For the financial markets, the immediate effect of the war was to spark off a round of increased volatility. In this environment of uncertainty, investors are starting to look for financial ‘safe havens,’ somewhere to put their money that will weather the current storm. According to David Kostin, chief US equity strategist for Goldman Sachs, the logical place to look is among the high-yield dividend stocks. In a recent note, Kostin lays out his belief that the S&P companies will work to attract nervous investors this year by paying out richer stock dividends. This effect, in his view, will be most pronounced in the energy sector, where rising crude oil prices will make up for supply chain snarls or production backups. Overall, Kostin sees the S&P companies showing 10% dividend growth year-over-year for 2022, up from his previous prediction of 8%. But the Ukraine war and its impact on the energy trade is not the only factor to support dividends. “High dividend yield and high dividend growth stocks also typically outperform during periods of high inflation and currently trade at attractive valuations,” Kostin added. With this in mind, we’ve used TipRanks’ database to seek out three stocks whose profile justifies the entry risk in today’s unsettled conditions. All three are backed by several analysts, enough to earn a “strong buy” consensus rating. And better yet, for income-minded investors, all three of these stocks show high and reliable dividend yields. Let's take a closer look. Valero Energy Corporation (VLO) First up is Valero Energy, a major player in the market for refined oil products. In fact, Valero is the world’s largest independent petroleum refiner and the second-largest producer of renewable fuels. The company’s products include gasoline and kerosene, jet fuel, diesel oil, and lubricating oils, as well as non-fuel petroleum derivatives like asphalt. While political pressures are pushing the industry toward renewable fuel products, Valero’s strong position in that market provides the company with a degree of protection from pricing pressures. The upshot of this is that Valero’s stock has been rising in the difficult environment of recent months. The shares hit their bottom last August, and are up 46% since then. They have found support from both rising revenues and rising earnings. At the top line, revenues in 4Q21 jumped 116% year-over-year, passing the $28.6 billion forecast, to hit $35.9 billion. At the bottom line, adjusted earnings came in at $2.47 per share, the third quarter in a row of EPS profits and far above the year-ago quarter’s $1.06 EPS loss. These strong results supported a vigorous policy of returning profits to shareholders. In Q4, the company paid out $401 million in dividends, and returned $1.6 billion for all of 2021. For the full year, this came out to 50% of the net cash flow from operations. Valero’s current dividend payments stands at 98 cents per common share. The last declaration, made in January, was paid out early this month. At the current rate, the dividend annualizes to $3.92 and gives a yield of 4.5%. The company has a 9-year history of maintaining, and slowly increasing, the dividend payment. In coverage for Raymond James, 5-star analyst Justin Jenkins is crystal clear that Valero has solid prospects ahead. He writes: “We believe Valero remains extremely well-positioned to capitalize on the continued improvement in global refining margins/demand, especially as the ripple effects of the global natural gas price surge add to the advantages of VLO’s portfolio. The company’s disciplined strategy in recent years has positioned VLO at the forefront of top-tier refining operations, while the footprint in both renewable diesel and now carbon capture is well ahead of energy industry peers. We think both trends represent a further 're-rate' story for the stock, while the broader macro lurches even further toward the U.S. refining industry's favor.” In line with these comments, Jenkins rates VLO shares a Strong Buy, and predicts a price target of $35, for a 21% one-year upside. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~25% potential total return profile. (To watch Jenkins’ track record, click here) Overall, the bulls are running for Valero Energy. The stock has picked up 11 positive reviews from Wall Street’s analysts, for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus. Meanwhile, the $98.09 average price target suggests an upside potential of 14% going forward. (See VLO stock analysis on TipRanks) TotalEnergies (TTE) Next up is the French-based energy giant TotalEnergies. As the name suggests, TotalEnergies operates in more than just oil and gas. While hydrocarbon exploration and extraction make up a large part of the company’s operations, Total is also deeply involved in transport and refining of crude oil and natural gas, as well as their distillates, and other petrochemical products. The company is also a major power producer, and a leading player in the European chemical manufacturing industry. Rising prices throughout the hydrocarbon sector in the past year have been a huge boon to producers, and TotalEnergies is no exception. The company has seen its earnings rise from just 2 cents per share in 2Q20 to $2.55 per share in 4Q21 – for six consecutive quarters of sequential EPS growth. Top line results have been solid, too. At $55.2 billion, revenues were up 70% year-over-year, and like EPS, revenues have shown 6 quarters of sequential growth. TotalEnergies pays out its dividend in Euros, and has kept it constant at 66 Euro cents per common share for the past 10 quarters. Adjusting for exchange rates can cause the payment to shift slightly in USD equivalent; the most recent payment, came to 74.8 cents US. At an annualized rate of $2.99 per common share, TotalEnergies's dividend yields 6%. Analyst Ryan Todd covers TTE for Piper Sandler, and he sees the company in a sound position to keep paying out high dividends. Explaining this view, he writes, For the second quarter in a row, TotalEnergies demonstrated its advantaged exposure to the current energy environment, reporting a strong 4Q beat, driven primarily by a robust iGRP performance, led by Total's leading LNG positioning. Despite higher-than-expected organic capex that more than offset a CFO beat (FCF $4.7B vs. PSC $6.6B), we continue to see a material acceleration in FCF and likely upside to shareholder distributions in 2022."" Backed by these comments, Todd sets an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on TTE shares. His price target, at $72, suggests an upside of 46% in the next 12 months. (To watch Todd’s track record, click here) Are other analysts in agreement? They are. Only Buy ratings, 4 to be exact, have been issued in the last three months. Therefore, the message is clear: TTE is a Strong Buy. Given the $74.1`0 average price target, shares could surge ~51% in the next year. (See TTE stock analysis on TipRanks) Amcor, Plc. (AMCR) Now let’s shift gears, and move over to an industrial stock. Amcor produces packaging, the ‘stuff’ that the world’s finished products are packed into for shipping and sales. Amcor works in over 40 countries and has a global reach, providing packaging for everything from pet care products to the food and beverage industry. While the supply chain disruptions of the past year have put a headwind in Amcor’s way, the overall economic opening has given Amcor an hefty boost. Revenues are up year-over-year, and earnings have matched or beaten estimates in each of the past four reported quarters. That most recent report, for the first half of fiscal year 2022, showed net sales of $6.9 billion for the six months ending on Dec 31. This was up 12% from the previous half-year. EPS for the half matched the forecasts, at 36 cents, and was up 20% from the 30 cents reported in fiscal 1H20. While Amcor reports by halves, it pays the dividend quarterly – and has a 2-year history of reliably keeping up the payments. This includes the whole of the pandemic crisis, during which Amcor not only continued the payments, but importantly did not reduce the dividend. That dividend, at 12 cents per common share, annualizes to 48 cents – and yields a strong 4.2%. BMO's 5-star analyst Mark Wilde is upbeat about this industrial stock, writing: “We like AMCR. It is focused on mix management and has identified priority segments, including protein, healthcare, coffee, pet food, and hot-fill beverage. Rigids should return to earnings growth in F2H. AMCR is not ‘cheap’ at 11.7x F2022E EBITDA. However, capital returns are ramping up, it has a hefty dividend yield, and the balance sheet is strong.” Wilde’s stance is supported by an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on the stock, and his $14 price target shows his confidence in a one-year upside of 24%. (To watch Wilde’s track record, click here) This stock hasn’t managed a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating – but the analysts do line up 3 to 1 in favor of the Buys over Holds. The shares have an average price target of $13.09, which implies an upside of ~16% from the current trading price of $11.29.

3/8/2022,"What can we make of the markets right now? On Friday, we saw the February jobs numbers – and they were far above the expectations. The economy added 678,000 jobs in the month, against a forecast of 400,000, and the official unemployment rate ticked down to 3.8%. It was the best jobs print of the ‘pandemic era.’ But it didn’t move the dial. The war in Ukraine did, and that movement wasn’t positive. All three of Wall Street’s major benchmarks are down as this week gets started, capping a weeks-long string of high market volatility overlaid on a downward trend. The NASDAQ leads the way, down 2.3%. This leaves the average retail investor wondering just how to recognize stocks with real potential. After all, one of the few certainties of unsettled market conditions like we’re seeing now is that the ‘normal’ signs and signals have broken down. So maybe it’s time to check in with the market’s major institutions, the ones that, to a degree, set the rules in the first place. This can bring us to a Wall Street giant like JPMorgan. JPMorgan isn’t just any giant bank; it’s the giant of the giants, the largest US bank, and the world’s fifth largest by total assets. And this behemoth to the market has picked out two beaten-down stocks that investors need to watch for a rebound. Using TipRanks’ database, we found out that the rest of the Street is also on board as both have earned a “Strong Buy” consensus rating. Grid Dynamics Holdings (GDYN) We’ll start with Grid Dynamics, a provider of consulting, analytics, and engineering services in the digital transformation niche. In short, Grid Dynamics is a tech company that helps other companies make digital upgrades, especially upgrades to cloud-based operations. This Silicon Valley tech firm has taken a hard hit in recent months. The stock peaked in December of 2021 with a price just above $42. Since then, it has tumbled badly, losing 75% of its share value in just over 2 months. That loss came even as the company expanded its operational footprint and reported solid quarterly earnings. On the expansion side, Grid Dynamics announced in February that it was entering the Indian market via a strategic partnership with Cygnet Infotech. The move gives the company a larger presence in South Asia, a rapidly growing economic region with a population of some 1.5 billion. The partnership is the first phase of a long term plan for South Asia expansion that will go into next year. On the earnings side, the company reported its 4Q21 results early this month, and showed a record level quarterly top line of $66.5 million, more than double the $30.1 million reported in the year-ago quarter. At the bottom line, the non-GAAP diluted EPS came in at 10 cents, 2.5x the 4 cents reported one year ago, and 11% higher than the 9-cent forecast. However, like many tech firms, Grid Dynamics hires talent where it finds it – and the company had found a lot of such talent in Ukraine. Grid Dynamics’ website lists 217 positions open in Kharkiv, 206 in Kyiv, and another 196 in Lvov. The company’s exposure to the Russia-Ukraine war is a headwind that cannot be avoided. In covering GDYN for JPMorgan, analyst Puneet Jain notes this exposure, but believes the stock price has fallen far enough to reflect that headwind. “Given the recent Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, we are proactively setting a lower bar for 2022 growth. We assume a reasonably adverse case scenario in which the ongoing turmoil persists for more than a few weeks, and leads IT buyers to delay new projects or award them to other countries (no impact on existing work). We'd also expect the company to increase focus on ramping up other countries/regions, and service incremental demand from elsewhere, but conservatively assume a near term headwind (mostly 1Q/2Q) to get 16% organic growth in CY22 (vs. 20% before). However, we think that recent stock weakness more than adequately discounts the risk of a slower revenue growth rate,"" Jain opined. Looking forward, Jain gives this stock an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating, along with a $23 price target that implies an upside of 137% for the coming year. (To watch Jain’s track record, click here) While Grid Dynamics has fallen sharply recently, Wall Street still gives it a Strong Buy rating. That consensus is based on 5 recent reviews, including 4 to Buy and 1 to Hold. The shares are selling for $9.82 and their $21.70 average price target suggests ~121% upside potential. (See GDYN stock forecast on TipRanks) Singular Genomics Systems (OMIC) Now we’ll change pace and head over to a medical research company. Singular Genomics is working on multiomics technologies, the next generation of genetic sequencing and the tools that are set to build a new wave of genetically-based medicines and medical products. Singular Genomics made another large stride in that path last quarter, 4Q of 2021, when it launched its G4 platform. This platform, the company’s latest, is a benchtop genome sequencer, offering greater accuracy, flexibility, speed, and power to boost applications in oncological and immunological research. G4 instrument kits are now in production, and first kits are in internal testing. The company expects to commence deliveries in 2Q22. G4 deliveries, when they start, will be a major leap for Singular Genomics, as it will also mark the start of a revenue stream. For the now, the company remains highly speculative for investors, dependent on raising capital to offset operating expenses and losses. Singular Genomics went public last year, with an IPO at the end of May, and since then has seen the share price gradually fall by 73%. JPMorgan's 5-star analyst Tycho Peterson lays out a strong case for Singular Genomics to reach profitability in the near future, writing: “Overall, we are encouraged by the continued early launch progress of the G4 and the pipeline. While 2022 is set to be a busy year for the sequencing industry with multiple recent and upcoming competitive launches (ILMN, PACB/Omniome Element Biosciences, Ultima), OMIC remains confident in its competitive differentiation around throughput and cost (and accuracy once HD-Seq launches). With a differentiated technology and strong IP position, as well as unique value propositions in target applications, OMIC has an encouraging prospect of driving attractive revenue growth and margin expansion, and we believe solid commercial progress will drive multiple expansion over time…” To this end, Peterson gives OMIC shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and sets a $25 price target that indicates his confidence in a robust 250% potential upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Peterson’s track record, click here) Judging by the consensus breakdown, opinions are anything but mixed. With 3 Buys and no Holds or Sells assigned in the last three months, the word on the Street is that OMIC is a Strong Buy. At $23, the average price target implies ~222% upside potential.

3/8/2022,"Stocks may be well off their highs amid rising concerns on the Russia-Ukraine war, but now doesn't mark a great buying opportunity, warns UBS strategist Stuart Kaiser. ""We are definitely not buyers of the dip at this point. For perspective, we were worried about the first half of this year before the Russia-Ukraine conflict even started just based on the Fed and the growth in inflation dynamics. The geopolitical stuff just reinforces that,"" Kaiser said on Yahoo Finance Live. Markets would seem to agree with Kaiser's hot take. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite declined on Monday, but came off session lows from pre-market trading. Traders piled into safe haven assets, notably gold as prices briefly jumped above $2,000 per ounce for the first time since September 2020. Investors took their cues from spikes in the energy complex on worries the West will ban Russian oil exports. Brent crude oil prices surged to nearly $140 a barrel on Sunday evening, but have since settled to below $130 a barrel. Meanwhile, gas prices have risen to an all-time high. Shares of ExxonMobil, Chevron, Occidental, Transocean and other oil names had some of the most active ticker pages on Yahoo Finance through midday Monday. To be sure, Kaiser isn't alone on the Street in practicing extreme caution on risk-taking. ""Sell any relief rallies from oversold conditions,"" said Morgan Stanley strategist Mike Wilson.

3/8/2022,"A financial research company has raised eyebrows by saying there is a 10pc chance of civilisation being destroyed in a nuclear apocalypse – while urging clients to keep buying shares regardless. BCA Research, a Canadian business, told clients to “stay bullish” on stocks and “largely ignore existential risk” as their investments will become “irrelevant” if the Ukraine crisis leads to nuclear armageddon.

It put the chance of a civilisation-destroying nuclear war in the next 12 months at an “uncomfortably high” one-in-10, as tensions between Russia and the West escalate.

Peter Berezin, chief global strategist at BCA, wrote: “Despite the risk of nuclear war, it makes sense to stay constructive on stocks over the next 12 months.

“If an ICBM [intercontinental ballistic missile] is heading your way, the size and composition of your portfolio becomes irrelevant. Thus, from a purely financial perspective, you should largely ignore existential risk.”

He concluded: “The risk of Armageddon has risen dramatically. Stay bullish on stocks over a 12-month horizon.”

The Kremlin has put Russia’s nuclear forces – the largest in the world – on “high alert” and has argued that Nato’s onslaught of financial sanctions are “akin to an act of war”.

Global stock markets tumbled last week as Vladimir Putin doubles down on the invasion of Ukraine.

The FTSE 100 suffered its worst week since March 2020, when the pandemic first struck with the rout wiping more than £130bn off the UK’s blue-chip shares. Mr Berezin said: “If Putin concludes that he has no future, the risk is that he will decide that no one else should have a future either.”

BCA warned that markets could experience a “freak-out moment” over the next few weeks even if World War III is ultimately avoided.

Defence secretary Ben Wallace has played down the threat of nuclear war, saying Mr Putin is touting his arsenal in a “battle of rhetoric”.

Mr Wallace said last week: “This is predominantly about Putin putting it on the table just to remind people, remind the world, that he has a deterrent.""
