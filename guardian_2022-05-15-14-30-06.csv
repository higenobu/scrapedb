5/15/2022,"Scott Morrison has promised Australians a “new era of opportunity” if re-elected, while pitching a fight with Labor over housing with a centrepiece policy to allow first home-buyers to tap into their superannuation savings. Setting up a contrast with Labor for the final week of the election campaign, the prime minister used the Liberal party’s official campaign launch to promise a new super home buyer scheme that would allow people to access up to $50,000 of superannuation savings for the purchase of a first home. He said the super scheme would be a “game changer” for people entering the housing market and that Labor’s alternative housing policy of a shared equity scheme wanted to “put the government at the centre of everything”. “This is about increasing the choices available to you, with your super. It’s your money,” Morrison said. “This will be a game changer for thousands of Australian families. They sit and look at the money on their balance and go: if only I had that to help me now.” The policy is in addition to an extension of a retiree housing policy to encourage downsizing that was also announced on Sunday, a new $375m cancer centre for Queensland and a $450m boost to defence. Urging voters to stick with the Coalition as Australia emerged from the pandemic, Morrison promised a “big plan” for the next term of government that was about unlocking the aspirations of Australians. “I’m seeking a second term because I am just warming up,” Morrison said. He spoke about his belief that the country was moving to better times ahead after enduring “one of the most challenging times we have ever known”, acknowledging it had been an “exhausting time” and people were over politics. Morrison said that the nation, after standing on the edge of an “abyss” when gripped by fear and uncertainty during Covid, was now ready to “put this pandemic behind us”. “We’ve been building a bridge to the other side economically in a time of global uncertainty, and here we are. We now stand on a different edge to the one that I spoke of before: one where fear doesn’t dominate, but aspiration – something we know a lot about as Liberals and Nationals – for the Australian people. “This requires a very different approach from us as a government to the mode we’ve had to be in over these many difficult years, but it’s also been one that we have been preparing for and we are ready to get on with. “We stand on the edge of a new era of opportunity; better days now are ahead, but we cannot take them for granted. As a government, we have the higher gears to secure that opportunity and I know our economic plan is working because Australians are working, and we are heading in the right direction.” The pitch for a better future comes as Morrison seeks to recast his image in the final days of the election campaign. On Friday, he acknowledged that he had been a “bulldozer” at times, and was now ready to shift to a different gear in the wake of the pandemic. Morrison’s unpopularity has dominated much of campaign. There is particular concern among MPs in so-called teal seats that his poor standing among voters will lose the Coalition previously safe Liberal-held electorates. The prime minister said on Sunday that while he had not got everything right, he had poured his “heart and soul into this job every single day”. “You do all you can to help Australians achieve their aspirations. You don’t get everything right. I’ve never pretended that I have. But I tell you what, I never leave anything on the field,” he said. “It’s a great privilege to serve in this role. It’s the great professional privilege of my life and I’m seeking a second term to ensure that we can take this to the next level, to those better days. “We have worked so hard together, friends, to get to where we have needed to get to. We have worked so hard and our plan will take us … to where we have been working hard to get to. “Our team will continue to put it in every single day because we all love our country and we love our fellow Australians.” The first part of Morrison’s speech focused on the government’s pandemic response, with the prime minister talking up the role played by Australians to get through the pandemic – and the interventions, such as jobkeeper, that the Coalition had introduced. “We kept our head in the crisis,” he said. “We made sure we got it right as best as we could, but we weren’t perfect. And not everything went to plan but you know, when it didn’t, and while others were criticising, we just worked feverishly to turn it around and make it up. “What followed was the largest economic and public health response in Australia’s history,” he said. “We gave our fellow Australians that assurance in those very difficult times that tomorrow would be OK, so they could say the same thing to their children, to their employees, and I’m quite sure, indeed, to themselves.” He said that at this point he had needed to display “strength” and push through. “I had one focus, as your prime minister: save the country.”",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison uses Liberal party campaign launch to set up housing battle with Labor,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/15/scott-morrison-uses-liberal-party-campaign-launch-to-set-up-housing-battle-with-labor
5/15/2022,"The back is broken of the heavy lifting. Howard and mine, too. But we are in. Branch Hill allotments are near unrecognisable. The wildness is dimmed. But the organic gardeners are gathering and this will soon change. We are greeted at the gate by stacks of sacks. We have ordered 50 bags of “heavy horse manure” for the plot: 25 each for Mary and us. The new allotment soil is thin and sandy. It will need love and work – and worms. We have three giant ‘dumpy bags’ of soil conditioner (a mix of manure, composted bark and grit) to be shovelled into barrows and wheeled to the plot. Howard is the perfect companion. And within a day or so it is done. We lay three longish piles through Mary’s part of the plot. We stack bags near her seedling beds for easy access. It is good work. I have spotted a couple of baby red orache, a 1in sunflower and, of course, nasturtiums on the stripped-bare bank next door. They were blown from our precious previous life. I gather them gently, re-home them on the plot. Something of the past to carry forward. We dig, we hoe, we rake. We lay a new path. We try to stand up straight. By the end of Sunday of the early May bank holiday, the summer plot is starting to take shape. The work will largely be about soil now. Around us, people are returning with leggy seedings from their windowsills to be given their forever home. We are waiting on pea sticks and bean poles, so I sort through sacks of seed. I want the first sowing to be from the crops we saved from late last year: Hopi Red amaranth, calendula and climbing nasturtium. There is our coriander to be grown again for its delicate flower.

5/15/2022,"It was Nina’s 88th birthday, and she marked it by leaving behind everything she had known. Volunteers, not particularly young or fit themselves, carried her down three flights of stairs from her flat, past the irises about to bloom in her neighbour’s patch of garden. Apartment buildings hid the ruins of the local school, destroyed last week by a Russian missile, but the war intruded on the yard anyway, the regular thump of distant artillery echoing through the sunny afternoon. This corner of Donbas is one of the few parts of Ukraine still threatened by an advancing army, and fear has largely emptied the town of Konstiantynivka of its families. Defeated in Kyiv, pushed back from Kharkiv, Moscow has thrown its anger and many extra troops into long stretches of the eastern front. Targets are pulverised by artillery and airstrikes, then Russian soldiers move forward a few miles and declare the “liberation” of places such as Popasna – more ruin than town when it was captured, survivors say. “There is no Popasna now,” said Oleh, a construction worker who had tried to ride out the fighting in a basement shelter with his family until their own home was hit. “Even when you look at photos and videos, your brain can’t understand what you are seeing. It’s hard to know that this is where you lived.” Residents of places that might be next have been urged by government and relatives to leave while it is still possible, advice that many heeded weeks ago. Driving through the region is a journey through ghost towns, with empty streets of shuttered shops, deserted homes and abandoned parks. An eerie quiet interrupted only by air raid sirens or explosions hangs over these half-abandoned communities – from Bakhmut, the last major Ukrainian-held outpost before the frontline at Popasna, west to Kramatorsk, site of a bloody attack on civilians waiting for an evacuation train, or south through Druzhkivka to Konstiantynivka. Only the hospital trauma wards are bustling, filled with the terrible shrapnel wounds of a war waged mostly by rocket and artillery, bringing severed limbs and lacerated bodies. Those who gambled on staying – hoping the Russians won’t arrive or their homes won’t be hit – are mostly the old, the sick and the poor, who can’t physically leave, fear they can’t afford to live somewhere else, or simply can’t face starting again somewhere new so late in life. “I’m too old for this,” said Oleksandr, 67, his face crumpling into tears as he waited to be driven away from his home of 33 years, with his wife, Tanya, 64. He is a stroke survivor who can barely walk, and his daughter had badgered the couple into accepting an evacuation offer from Druzhkivka before they become trapped there by a rain of Russian shells. “I’m a little scared,” Tanya admitted. “We’ve been hearing heavy bombing for a week now, there was one last night.” As she waved goodbye to a few hold-out neighbours, all retirees like themselves, one woman in sandals asked how she could get on the list for a ride. Like so much of the civilian response to the Russian invasion, this evacuation is an unlikely and improvised effort run by volunteers willing to risk their lives for strangers. They help those who are too ill to leave in ordinary cars, or can’t afford to pay for their own travel, or are daunted by the logistics of fleeing across a country at war. Vlad is driving the lead car, finding addresses and reassuring the evacuees. Mark Poppert, an American who has left his home in Doha to volunteer with a local Ukrainian charity, Vostok SOS, is at the wheel of a van that serves as a rudimentary ambulance for evacuees who can’t sit up. They have already called at Druzhkivka to collect Oleksandr and Tanya; now the makeshift convoy has arrived in Konstiantynivka. Poppert wears a Stetson as a nod to his Nebraskan roots. “So the Ukrainians know they have international support,” he says, although it is unclear how many locals pick up on the gesture of solidarity. The two men use Google Translate to communicate, because they have no shared language to manage their urgent shared mission. Russian bombs are not the only threat residents of these small towns are trying to balance. The pressures of war has thrown daily life into chaos and made people vulnerable in other ways. Nina and her daughter Irena, 60, were both being treated for cancer at Kramatorsk hospital, but with the Russian advance their doctors leftand the oncology ward was . Nina’s grandson Anatoly, 43, is disabled and Irena is clearly frantic with worry about what the interruption to her treatment could mean for him. “We had no relatives to help us organise healthcare,” said Irena. “My mother is paralysed and can’t talk, but we couldn’t even get any painkillers. We are going to Dnipro now: someone said they will help us get into hospital there.” After Nina is carried down the stairs by their rescuers, she is laid carefully on a bedding roll spread on the floor of Mark’s van, her head protected by pillows, for the two-hour drive to a special evacuation train leaving from Pokrovsk. Signs in the windows read “invalids”, more for the railway guards than for Russian attackers. When the convoy arrives, everyone on the platform is slightly nervous, after last month’s strike on nearby Kramatorsk station. For many of those climbing on board, this escape from immediate danger will be the most painful but straightforward step in a long and difficult journey towards some kind of new life. Also in Vlad’s car are Irina, five months pregnant, and her nine-year-old daughter Amina. “I was afraid to be alone with a child on the way, they said the town was being encircled and we should leave,” said Irina, after making a final reading of the gas meter and handing the key of her rented flat over to her landlady. She leaves behind an aunt who is like a mother to her, a job at a local gas company, and – like all the others who are going – the only place she has ever called home. Pregnant and with a child, she is striking out into the unknown with little more than a phone number of a friend in Poland. “She said we could stay, I’ll call her when I get near Warsaw and she will give me the exact address,” she said. Charities have been warning about the trafficking of women like Irina, vulnerable and alone, as they cross into Europe. The risks of this journey into the unknown is one reason some stay near the frontline. “We have relatives in the west, but we don’t have any job. How will we support ourselves when we get there?” said Oleh, who drove his wife, son, daughter-in-law, two granddaughters and their cat through heavy shelling to Bakhmut. After the intense battle for Popasna, the ghost towns of Donetsk seem like something of a haven, and they have free beds in a shelter, so they plan to stay in Bakhmut for now, despite a steady increase in shelling. “One recent hit was on a student dormitory. Children had been playing there half an hour before, but fortunately they had just left,” said Bakhmut deputy mayor Maksym Sutkovyi. He estimates that at least a third of the town’s prewar population of about 100,000 have stayed, a number swelled by people escaping from fighting to the east. “Of course I’m worried: we understand that the war in its next phase can come here,” he said, but he plans to stay, along with the rest of the town council. “Those who stay need basic living conditions, and we have to maintain critical infrastructure … people will better support our army and country if we are here.”",News/World news,‘I’m too old for this’: the harrowing flight from Donetsk’s perilous border towns,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/15/im-too-old-for-this-the-harrowing-flight-from-donetsks-perilous-border-towns
5/15/2022,"Fewer than half of people in Scotland say they support retaining the monarchy, according to a major new poll that reveals the cultural divides emerging within the union. Almost six in 10 people across Britain want to retain the monarchy for the foreseeable future, with only a quarter saying that the end of the Queen’s reign would be an appropriate time for Britain to become a republic. The overwhelming majority, some 85%, expect that Britain will still have a monarchy in a decade’s time. However the poll, by the British Future thinktank, found that only 45% in Scotland said they wanted to retain the monarchy – with 36% saying the end of the Queen’s reign would be the right moment to move to a republic. Some 19% either rejected the choice, or said they didn’t know. It also revealed weaker support among young people and ethnic minorities across Britain. Only 40% of 18 to 24-year-olds backed keeping the monarchy, while 37% of people from an ethnic minority did so. The revelations come at a crucial time for the monarchy, as Prince Charles takes on more of the Queen’s most important public duties. Last week, he delivered the Queen’s speech for the first time, after she was forced to pull out because of mobility problems. The occasion marks one of the monarch’s most important ceremonial duties. Her absence came just weeks before her platinum jubilee. The four-day celebration is set to include several outings for the Queen, including a service at St Paul’s Cathedral. The palace has said she currently plans to attend. British Future’s study exposed clear issues among certain groups. Younger people expressed ambivalence about the future of the monarchy, with 37% feeling that the end of the Queen’s reign would be the right time to move on and become a republic. Among those aged 16-18, only 36% agree that “we should keep the monarchy for the foreseeable future”. The clear drop in support for the monarchy in Scotland compared with Britain as a whole also comes at a time when the union is under continued pressure. The SNP has said that it is committed to retaining the monarchy should Scotland vote for independence. A Panelbase poll last summer, which was worded differently to British Future’s survey, found that 47% of Scottish adults would vote to keep a royal head of state, compared with 35% who would favour an elected head of state. Further growing splits were identified in attitudes to other symbols of national identity such as the union flag. Most respondents associated it with the monarchy (72%), Team GB (71%) and the armed forces (68%). However, a quarter of people (25%) associate it with racism and extremism – an increase of 10 points since 2012. The England flag is more contentious. While 60% of the public and 62% of minority groups think it represents pride and patriotism, almost a third of the public as a whole (32%) see it as representing racism and extremism, including 43% of those from an ethnic minority. There were also suggestions that the forthcoming jubilee could be used as a vehicle to further unite Britons, but there is a relative lack of interest in Scotland. Only 48% of people north of the border are interested in the jubilee – fewer than said they were interested in the World Cup in December, despite the fact that Scotland have not yet qualified. This contrasts with 73% of people in Wales and two-thirds across England who are interested in next month’s events. The findings are included in a forthcoming British Future report looking at how attitudes have changed in the 10 years since the last jubilee. Polling was carried out for the study by FocalData. Sunder Katwala, director of British Future, said the jubilee provided a chance to unify the country: “Major events can bring people together if they are done in an inclusive way that broadens their reach and appeal,” he said. “Getting this right would be good for our society – and for the monarchy too, helping address some of the challenges it faces to stay relevant in modern Britain, particularly in Scotland.”",News/UK news,"Scottish support for monarchy falls to 45%, poll reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/15/scottish-support-for-monarchy-falls-to-45-poll-reveals
5/15/2022,"It seems ironic that, in a system where the majority of multi-academy trust CEOs are very well-paid males, it should be so difficult to recruit and retain men in classroom roles (“No place for young men? Male teachers quit as pay levels drop”, News). It’s not just the take-home pay that is the issue, eroded as it has been by pay “pauses” (aka freezes). The ever-widening pay gap is exacerbated by performance-related pay, which regularly delivers bonuses to the top, but much less reliably to the lower echelons. School budgets often can’t run to rewarding hard work and high performance for teachers. Yet workload remains excessive and rising. Weekends and holidays are snaffled by preparation, extra teaching (revision) and accountability. The ratio of pay to hours worked is more unbalanced than ever. Promotion is less financially rewarding now that the 2022 pay arrangements target higher rises at new teachers and hardly enhance remuneration for more experienced and senior staff. Teachers in it for the long haul should also keep an eye on their pensions. The independent sector is removing itself from the teachers’ pension scheme; how long before academy chains follow suit if the government subsidy is withdrawn? Teaching has become an under-rewarded, unrewarding stressful profession – and it isn’t just men who are disillusioned.Yvonne WilliamsRyde, Isle of Wight Teacher low pay, for women and men, is a problem created by those Conservatives and academy managers who sneer at classroom teaching as temporary work. Because Conservatives have an eye on the next election, the use of exam results and league table positions in electioneering helps academies turn classroom teaching into arduous, short-term, exam-factory work. This is seriously at variance with the long-term purpose of teaching. The tension it creates is reported daily as the crisis in student mental health and the shortage of teachers. A coherent solution includes securing well-paid, psychologically literate classroom teachers whose professional knowledge rivals those in countries the UK trails behind in international comparisons.Dr Miles SeckerHeckington, Lincolnshire If Philip Hoare (“Why monsters tap into our fear of the unknown”, Focus) wants to continue to fear and wonder at what might lie beneath the surface of seas and waterways, he might like to take a plunge into the Trent and Mersey canal, as I did a couple of years ago. I saw stuff in there that still gives me nightmares.Ian GrieveGordon Bennett, Llangollen canal Along with over half a million other Australians, I signed Kevin Rudd’s petition calling for a royal commission into NewsCorp: what he called “a cancer on democracy”. It’s even more necessary now. As a leftwing socialist, I disagree with Nick Cohen on many things, but full marks to him for calling for sanctions on the Murdoch press for its toadying to Putin.Prof John TullyDover, Tasmania, Australia The real seismic event in Northern Ireland is not Sinn Féin’s “victory” (“Seismic Sinn Féin victory fuels debate on future of the union”, News). Its share of the vote barely changed and it gained no seats. Rather, it is the surge in support for the non-sectarian Alliance party, which had the largest increase in votes and more than doubled its number of seats. Thus, the debate that should be fuelled is how to change the Good Friday agreement to allow non-sectarian parties a role in how Northern Ireland is run.Jon BurdenLondon W14 The latest World Health Organization report has led to a debate about which countries handled the pandemic best (“Sweden? Japan? UK? Debates over who had a ‘good’ Covid won’t end”, Comment). The only real winner here is scientific progress. We’ve seen unprecedented research into vaccines, drug development, wearables, apps, microscopes and more. It doesn’t matter who had a “good” Covid. It’s how we use these scientific advancements that counts.Charlie RappleOxford No, Andrew Rawnsley, no: Jeremy Corbyn’s years were not an “electoral catastrophe” for the Labour party (“Boris Johnson’s Tories exhibit the morbid symptoms of a fin-de-siècle regime”, Comment). In 2019, his Labour party’s share of the vote was greater than Miliband’s in 2015 and Brown’s in 2010. The party’s loss was rather due to the cynical stitch-up between Johnson and Farage, with the result that the latter’s Brexit party took much of the working-class vote in the north of England. Take that out of the equation, and watch Johnson’s 80-seat majority vanish like snow in summer.Wal CallabyWhatfield, Ipswich Your excellent leading article analysing the local election results (“A poll with one clear truth: it was grim for the Tories”) surely missed one even clearer truth: given an increasingly fractured electorate, neither of the two major parties today can form a coherent coalition embracing different priorities without fracturing themselves in the process. When a “majority” party in Westminster is disdained by an increasing minority of voters nationally, the first-past-the-post system is no longer fit for purpose. This is not democracy. Proportional representation, as used widely in many other countries and successfully in parts of the UK, would both address and resolve the problem. Its time has surely come.Philip Bushill-MatthewsLeamington Spa, Warwickshire Living with partition, imposed by an imperial power as the price for peace, can indeed be compatible with preserving national independence (“Surrendering land is not the same as defeat – if a stronger Ukraine emerges from the ruins”, Comment). There is an example of that far closer to home than Georgia or middle Europe. The human cost can be heavy, as Ireland experienced over the last century: civil war, distorted politics and the agonising decades of the Troubles. But the attempt to reverse Ireland’s independence by military force ceased. It looks as though Ukraine may have to accept partition as the price for peace, and pay the human cost that this will bring – although first it will need to force Russia to accept that way out. But living with partition need not mean that Ukraine would ever have to recognise it as right or as permanent, any more than Ireland has.Kevin McGrathHarlow, Essex Catherine Bennett’s piece about rich New Yorkers at play and their apparent indifference to suffering elsewhere (“What do you get when a lack of taste meets a shedload of cash? Anna Wintour’s ball”, Comment) put me in mind of one of my favourite scenes in Billy Wilder’s Some Like It Hot, where Tony Curtis masquerades as a millionaire in order to impress Marilyn Monroe: Monroe: “You own a yacht? Which one is it? The big one?” Curtis: “Certainly not.

5/15/2022,"The dilemma My boyfriend proposed to me a couple years ago. I was delighted. Sadly, his family were less than impressed. Although I have a PhD, I’m American and his British family look down on me because I’m not British, and I didn’t attend Oxbridge. It’s ironic: none of them have anything near a PhD. I told my mother about this and she subsequently refused to communicate with my partner’s mother. The plans trudged on and both mothers became unbearable. My partner’s mother is toxic. She tore down every decision I made regarding my wedding. We chose a dreary venue, just to appease her. My partner and I wanted to hire a food truck for an evening snack, but she responded that she “hates” foreign food. Her solution? Food by the cook at the local boarding school (the food is terrible: think dry ham sandwiches). Covid meant we couldn’t have our wedding as originally planned. I was thankful I wouldn’t have to put up with either family. My partner now wants to get married, but I don’t want to if either set of parents are going to be present. I want to elope: I love him very much and I want to marry him. But he refuses to get married without his parents present. His mother and sister both accused me of stealing him away from them. This hurt and I will never forgive them: I never not once prevented my chap from attending a family event or anything like that. He tells me I can’t change them, I need to accept it and to be nice to them. Sorry, but no. No one seems to care what I, the bride, thinks. I feel really stuck. Philippa’s answer What you seem to want is a witness to back you up. You tried to get such a witness with your mother and that has made the whole situation so much worse. When you don’t have a witness for how you feel and how you experience the world, life can feel like a battle as you search for justice. My hunch is that any unfairness you may have experienced throughout your life may have been bottled up for a long time and it is all coming to a head with this current wedding crisis (it is a crisis for you, I can see that). Not having the wedding or eloping won’t make any of this go away. When we don’t feel safe in the world, we need enemies. Then we find them to try to feel in control again. That emotional charge within us seems to need to find people we can consider wrong, to make us feel right. The man you love says you can’t change his family and that you need to accept them and be nice to them. It seems that in order to do that you feel that you would somehow lose out or be annihilated but, I promise, you won’t. They are important to him, so if only for his sake, you need to try to understand them, rather than judge them. Take a bird’s-eye view of the situation: see yourself down there, trying to fight this battle, and don’t take sides. What do you notice? See if you can do this without thinking who is right and who is wrong, but just watch it unfold as you fly above it. Now you have some distance from it, you can see what part you play in this scene. What does it look like? What are everyone’s fears? How are they each handling them? How do they differ in what they dread? How are they similar? I expect everyone has feelings they are handling the only way they know how. Be curious about their feelings and about yours. Get to know how they all feel and feel for them. You might think: why should that be me? Why don’t they care how I feel? It has to be you because you feel stuck and want to come unstuck and you are the only one you have any control over. It has not been helpful to you to interpret everything they say as an attack on you, because then you feel like counterattacking. So rather than: “I haven’t prevented him coming to any family occasion” instead try: “I can understand it must be frightening to feel you’ll see less of such a lovely man, someone so important to you. I’ll try to share him.” Look for the feelings behind how they speak to you, empathise with those feelings, try to get on the same page. Accepting people isn’t always easy. We sometimes have to imagine what it is like to be them, and how they must feel and then feel with them. Rather than damning them with judgments I think your life would be better if you remained open with curiosity. I know they seem to judge you, but two wrongs will not make anything right. A marriage is not just one day, it is for life. You do not want to be playing a game of who is right and superior and who is wrong and inferior for years and years. For the best outcome, aim for understanding and empathy rather than judgment and victory. One day you might become a mother-in-law yourself and experience all this from the other side of the coin.

5/15/2022,"North Sea oilwells should be taxed more heavily and so should the production of natural gas. Energy companies are making record-breaking profits from the sale of hydrocarbons that lie in the deep water that surrounds Britain and that should shame the industry when the people paying the highest price are the poorest in society. It should shame them into willingly parting with some of the gains, especially when the price of oil and gas is dictated by global markets that are driven at the moment largely by the conflict in Ukraine. These are not super-profits that can be attributed to the ingenuity of their staff or foresight of company directors. It’s true that the economic recovery after the worst of Covid-19 was over has played a part, creating a mismatch of supply and demand. But Russian aggression and the west’s necessary sanctions on Moscow have delivered the exceptionally high prices we see today and the longer the conflict in eastern Europe continues, the longer prices will remain high. Illustrating the industry’s role for investors, BP reported last week that its profits in the first three months of the year more than doubled to $6.2bn (£5bn). This was the highest quarterly profit since the last time shortages of black gold prompted prices on global markets to rocket after the 2008 financial crash. Shell, the other major oil producer listed on the London stock exchange, also delivered bumper profits. The record-breaking $9.1bn (£7.3bn) generated in the first three months of the year beat the $6.3bn in the final quarter of 2021 and $3.2bn during the first quarter of last year. BP’s chief executive, Bernard Looney, let slip last November, when Brent crude hit $85 a barrel, that the business was “a cash machine at these types of prices”. His chief financial officer said in February after Brent crude went above $105 a barrel: “Certainly, it’s possible that we’re getting more cash than we know what to do with.” Looney, whose pay almost doubled last year to £4.5m, was asked later what investment projects he would cancel if a windfall tax was imposed on the firm’s profits. None, he replied. Proposals for a windfall tax, backed by Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, have become irresistible because, layer by layer, those attacking the industry have peeled away its lines of defence. Oil industry supporters said a windfall tax would be seen as an attack on all corporations, which would live in fear of a similar move. Yet nobody has suggested a windfall tax on other industries. If anything, major corporations from other sectors want a tax on the oil firms. John Allan, the Tesco chairman, said last week that a surcharge on oil companies was needed when the country was facing “real food poverty for the first time in a generation”. There was a suggestion that a tax on BP and Shell would hit the “widows and orphans” who rely on dividend income. Then it was revealed that UK pension funds own less than 0.2% of Shell and BP shares. Of the total market value of UK-listed shares, UK pension funds account for just 2.4%. A broader measure of indirect ownership via investment funds adds only another 6%. Rishi Sunak’s last stand against those calling for a windfall tax is to repeat the threat from the oil majors that it will stifle investment. Looney, backtracking on his earlier comments, said an £18bn investment plan represented 15% to 20% of the group’s global capital expenditure, up from the 10% to 15% that BP has historically deployed in the UK. Yet relatively small sums are being directed at renewable projects and the company’s bosses cannot unsay their comments last year that the firm is a cash machine and has more money than it knows what to with. Under Labour’s proposal, firms such as Harbour Energy, the largest oil and gas producer in the North Sea, and London-listed Serica Energy, which is responsible for about 5% of the UK’s gas production, would be caught by a tax that was on course at the time of the budget statement in March to raise around £2bn, but could be as much as £3bn today. BP would contribute about £250m, barely a blip on its financial radar. Earlier this month, this newspaper argued for a three-pronged approach to resolving the cost of living crisis. First, economic policy needs to target rising productivity and ensure the spoils are shared evenly with employees through increased wages; second, the real-terms cuts to benefits and tax credits of the past decade must be reversed; and third, the government must implement structural reforms to tackle the high cost of living, most importantly housing. One estimate suggested lower-income households will face a drop in income of £1,300 this year. A £3bn tax would go some way to redressing the balance, but the government should go further. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has told his officials that he objects to singling out North Sea firms because there are so many other companies involved in the supply and distribution of oil, gas and electricity making hay. It’s a good point. He should identify them and add them to the list of firms due a surcharge tax. However, Labour’s plan has the virtue of simplicity and so it is likely to be the option Sunak eventually agrees to implement. The chancellor has spent recent weeks telling MPs and TV audiences that he is mulling over the idea, but it is understood that only now is he considering the options compiled by his advisers in No 11. He needs to move quickly. Fairness demands it.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on the urgent need for a windfall tax on the energy giants | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/15/the-observer-view-on-a-windfall-tax-on-the-energy-giants
5/15/2022,"Jeff Bezos knew this day was coming. Back in April the Amazon boss warned of an impending market slowdown, tweeting that the epic tech boom experienced during the last two years could not last for ever. “Most people dramatically underestimate the remarkableness of this bull run,” he said. “Such things are unstoppable … until they aren’t. “Markets teach,” Bezos added. “The lessons can be painful.” For years the tech industry has led the stock market with bust-out profits, fueled by a pandemic that moved much of the world online. Now all that has changed, with trillions in market value lost in recent weeks. Once-hot startups are being ditched by investors, and even the tech giants seen as stable investments have faltered. Apple is no longer the most valuable company in the world, after losing $200bn in market value this week. It joins a number of other tech companies in a slump that began in late 2021, and brought the larger Nasdaq Composite down more than 13% in April – a more than 30% drop from record highs the previous year. Meta lost a record $230bn in market value in February after a disappointing earnings report in which it revealed its Facebook platform had experienced its first ever user decline. Amazon reported its first loss since 2015 in its most recent earnings report last month. Alphabet revenue fell short in its first-quarter report. Smaller firms are also struggling, with pandemic success story Peloton seeing shares plunge 20% this week as demand for indoor exercise equipment fell. Twitter announced in an internal memo on Thursday it was freezing new hires, and Meta did the same last week, citing an expense guidance given in its recent earnings report. Amazon said in a recent earnings call its warehouses were “overstaffed” and while it is not considering layoffs it is “working to remedy that”. Startups are seeing similar trends, with layoff tracking site Layoffs.fyi showing at least 55 tech firms have reported layoffs since the start of 2022 – compared with just 25 in the same time period of 2021. The hiring slowdown comes even as the broader market experiences employment growth, adding 431,000 jobs in April. The freeze is evidence that the boom in the market came from a confluence of unique factors, and was not a long-term trend, said Investing.com senior analyst Haris Anwar. “Overall market sentiments are reversing from the very bullish sentiment we’ve seen during the pandemic, during which the companies saw a huge boom in demand. In the post-pandemic world, that demand is now coming to more normalized level,” he said. As Covid-19 hit in early 2020, companies such as Peloton, Zoom and Netflix boomed as offices shuttered and people spent more time at home. Zoom saw its value explode more than 500% in one year, but in recent days has seen stock fall nearly to pre-pandemic lows. Netflix, which added more than 36 million subscribers during the first year of the pandemic, has lost more than half of its value since reporting disappointing results on 19 April. This kind of growth cannot be predicted, nor can it be maintained forever, said Raj Shah, analyst at digital transformation consultancy Publicis Sapient. “Revenues are down, costs are up, and tech companies are going to do what every other company in this situation would do – cut costs through freezing hiring, get rid of costs like unused real estate, push for higher productivity and re-examine investments,” he said. “Is this a tech bust? It remains to be seen,” he added. Pandemic recovery is not the only component slowing tech companies’ runaway growth, experts say. The war in Ukraine has had an effect on advertising spending and has accelerated supply chain problems already introduced by the pandemic, a difficulty cited in a number of recent earnings calls. “The war in Ukraine, which is a real tragedy on a humanitarian level, has also had an impact on our business,” Meta’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, said in a call with investors accompanying its first-quarter earnings report. “We’ve been blocked in Russia and we decided to stop accepting ads from Russian advertisers globally. We’ve also seen effects on business globally following the start of the war.” Such headwinds are likely spooking investors, said Brian Wieser, the global president for business intelligence at GroupM, accelerating the slowdown. “There’s an overwhelming sense of fear and concern a lot of decision makers have around all things economic right now,” he said. “The war certainly catalyzed a lot of it, but inflation and supply chain issues were already a problem.” US inflation was higher than expected in April, nearing a 30-year high at 8.3%. Inflation broadly impacts consumer spend, which can have a major impact on companies that rely on e-commerce. Fears that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates to the point where the economy will slip into recession is further affecting investor decisions, said Anwar, as many shy away from high-growth tech stocks. “Markets always thinking in advance,” he said. “Many investors are acting as if a depression is a done deal. Is that going to happen? It’s a big question mark. But it is why we are seeing an exodus from these stocks.” The tech slowdown has not been limited to the traditional market. As cryptocurrencies took a major nosedive this week, and Bitcoin fell well below $30,000 for the first time in nearly a year, wiping more than $200bn off the broader market, some declared that “crypto is dead”. Crypto’s stumble has been attributed, in part, to a recent shake-up in the market when a popular “stablecoin” called TerraUSD collapsed. Stablecoins, a type of digital currency pegged to the US dollar, are thought to be less volatile than traditional cryptocurrencies. Its fall has investors spooked that this is perhaps not true, said Tammy Da Costa, Analyst at DailyFX, as evidenced by the collapse of Terra coupled with a dismal earnings report from major crypto exchange Coinbase. “A major concern is that many retail traders have invested in bitcoin and cryptos in an effort to receive higher returns in a low interest rate environment,” he said. “Now, as price pressures mount and the cost of living continues to soar, fears [have raised] that a systemic shock may occur if large institutions continue to withdraw funds from their crypto portfolios.” Aside from digital currency blunders, the same market forces influencing big tech companies could also be affecting digital currencies, said Wieser. Although crypto has traditionally been thought of as separate from the market, it cannot escape the war in Ukraine and other major headwinds. “Higher interest rates make everyone more conscious about investing and the choices they’re making when it comes to momentum driven assets,” he said. “It doesn’t take a lot to send these kinds of markets the other direction.” While many are panicking, Wieser is quick to note that it’s not as if these companies are failing – it is that the explosive growth seen over the last two years is not sustainable. “Deceleration is not the same as decline,” he said. “If you’ve grown 20-30%, and then you are suddenly growing just 10%, it might feel like a significant change. But it’s not a crash.” While tech companies seem to be slowing hiring patterns, there are not yet indications that mass layoffs are on the horizon for leading companies such as Meta, Twitter, and Amazon – all of whom have all expressed that they have no plans to downsize. Still, rumors have been roiling that big cuts are on the horizon for smaller firms. “The next 6-8 weeks is going to be a bloodbath,” tweeted JD Ross, co-founder of the music investment platform Royal. “I’m hearing rumors about a ton of companies preparing to lay off 20-40% of their team.” The slowdown is coming from a confluence of factors affecting companies across the entire market, said Shah of Publicis Sapient: inflation, the war in Ukraine, supply chain woes, and changing consumer behaviors. Big tech companies will probably remain “safe harbors” – long woven into our digital lives and more likely to weather the storm of the market. But how the larger industry will be altered remains to be seen. “Tech shares are in for a bumpy ride,” he said.",News/Technology,‘Unstoppable until they aren’t’: are tech market losses signs of a bust?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/15/tech-market-boom-bust-stocks
5/15/2022,"Frances and Bobbi (Alison Oliver and Sasha Lane) are students in Dublin who, after performing at a spoken word night, are befriended by celebrated author Melissa and her “trophy” actor husband Nick (Jemima Kirke and Joe Alwyn). They quickly embark on a complex ménage à quatre, with Frances and Nick – the quieter two of the pack – soon forming a relationship. In terms of plot, this 12-part adaptation of Sally Rooney’s novel is simply about an affair. But it is the Rooney-verse details – tightly-packed dialogue, observations on class, growth and identity, and an endless space for intimacy – that always make her well-studied characters get under the skin. Hollie Richardson For reasons that aren’t altogether clear, Tom Cruise leads the all-star bill of this Windsor Castle-based bonanza – the first live event to be broadcast as part of the jubilee celebrations. Cruise will host one of the four performances, which collectively promise to take us on a “gallop through history” – including Helen Mirren’s turn as Queen Elizabeth I. Katherine Jenkins, Ant and Dec, Mo Farah and David Jason will also take part in this very odd but undoubtedly entertaining night. HR Anne and Ann’s status at Shibden Hall continues to draw heat; from an “idiotic” marriage announcement in the Halifax Guardian to comments from “tiresome, inarticulate men”, including those closer to home. “People are laughing at us,” frets Ann, who later drops a bombshell revelation. Ali Catterall Faces drop when the amateur boxers find out who they’ll be up against at next week’s fight night in east London’s renowned York Hall. Before then, they head home to see friends and family, returning to prove to Elba that they’re ready (or not) to get in the ring. HR Season three of the German drama breaks the surface of televisual waters like a brooding U-612, as the crew are ordered on a treacherous mission to the southern hemisphere under the command of Robert Ehrenberg. Meanwhile in Lisbon, Hagen Forster uncovers a plot to steal plundered wartime loot – but is his conscience getting the better of him? AC Polish Peaky Blinders, anyone? Based on Szczepan Twardoch’s novel, this pacy drama follows the often brutal machinations of gang life in pre-second world war Poland. The focus is a power struggle for control of a mafia-style syndicate but there’s a political edge too, with fascists, socialists and Jews scrapping it out and wider European conflict looming. Phil Harrison Ordinary Love, 10pm, BBC Two Lisa Barros D’Sa and Glenn Leyburn’s devastating drama is a masterpiece of observation. Lesley Manville and Liam Neeson play a couple who find themselves tested when she is diagnosed with breast cancer. While cancer films can err on the melodramatic – or worse, the schematic, using the illness as shorthand for character motivation – Ordinary Love never once takes its eye off the ball. If you’ve never been through anything like this, you’ll empathise. But if you have, you will recognise yourself, and that’s the best possible compliment to give. Stuart Heritage Louis Theroux: My Scientology Movie, 11:25pm, BBC Two Now that he’s a newly minted TikTok rapper, it might be the right time to look back at one of Theroux’s most ambitious endeavours. After decades on TV, his first theatrically-released documentary was designed to pitch him straight into the dark heart of an infamous religion. If the goal was for Theroux to disassemble Scientology from the inside, it isn’t a spoiler to say that the film was a failure. But as a look at one man struggling to land a punch on an intangibly sinister organisation, it ranks among Theroux’s best.

It’s as small and spare a film as you could imagine – two bored kids steal a police car abandoned by a corrupt sheriff, and are forced to outwit his attempts at vengeance – but the attention to detail is second to none.

5/15/2022,"Acme Fire Cult, Abbot Street, London E8 3DP. Snacks and small plates £3-£9, large plates £14-£24, dessert £6, wines from £31, beers £5-£6 When chefs Andrew Clarke and Daniel Watkins announced their latest venture together, in London’s Dalston, it was described as: “More than just a restaurant.” Really? What is it then? An amusement park? A fetish club? A branch of Ikea? One of those might prove handy. “It’s a cult.” Oh my. In fairness, if you were hunting for a London cook to head up a raging, devoted religious movement, Clarke would fit the bill. He has a foot-long beard that can house small mammals or be plaited into viable rope, and so many tattoos that he’s become a walking secular challenger to the Sistine Chapel ceiling. Or perhaps not. While he might make a good figurehead, I know him to be a thoughtful chap, who probably wouldn’t be comfortable with all the coercive control a true cult demands. He has been involved with significant projects tackling mental health issues in and around the hospitality business, and has talked in a compelling way about his own challenges. So take the bombast of the name Acme Fire Cult with a pinch of quality, artisanal sea salt. It really isn’t more than a restaurant. There are tables and chairs, both in the functional dining room and on the rugged deck outside, where heat lamps dangle. There are menus and waiters. You order and they bring, from the wood-fired grill outside, their only kitchen. It’s an interesting development in the live-fire cookery movement, which Clarke helped popularise through the much glossier St Leonard’s restaurant he ran with Jackson Boxer in Shoreditch. For obvious reasons to do with the caveman imagery of burning logs and woolly mammoths, live fire cookery has associations with hunks of meat. If you have the time, it can be a good way to cook the cheaper cuts from corners of the animal that, having worked harder, have more connective tissue, and need longer to break down. There is some of that on this menu, developed during a series of pop-ups over the past couple of years. For the most part, however, it is thrillingly, impressively vegetable led, part of a self-declared determination to get away from the whole “dude food” culture around fire and smoke. For this reason, I want it to be so much more than a cult, because cults tend to implode quickly under the weight of their own filthy impropriety. This needs to endure. Acme is also a collaboration with 40ft Brewery with whom they share a space, in a rough old yard next to the Dusty Knuckle Bakery, the wellspring for much of north London’s overly developed sourdough habit. The brewery doesn’t just provide beers to go with the food. By-products from brewing, such as yeast and spent grains, are used to make ferments and sauces. So far, so achingly “grim up north London”, for the Private Eye readers among you. Statement of the obvious: none of this would be important if the food wasn’t good. A great beard, tats and leaping flames do not dinner make. Happily, much of it is good. We start with their devilled eggs. Mary Berry would, I think, give these a basilisk stare. The traditional 1960s stalwart involved the boiled eggs being halved, the yolks removed, mixed with mayo and cayenne pepper and so on, whipped and returned. Here, the eggs have been cooked so the yolks have reached a perfect jellied state. They have then been drenched in a sweet-sour tamarind-like sauce and scattered with crisply fried onions. Even though I wished the devil to have more of a voice, a theme in a number of dishes which shy away from chilli heat, I could do damage to successive servings of these. They also make their own Bombay mix. It’s rich in toasted peanuts and cashews, which are usually in short supply for cost reasons. There is a certain amount of what could come across as innovation for its own sake among the small plates, except it all works. Leeks are grilled until the point of surrender, when they are sweet and soft. They are then served at room temperature with their own version of romesco sauce, in which the ground almonds have been substituted with ground pistachios. It’s a study in verdant shades of green. There’s a welcome acidity to the grainy romesco. New potatoes have been smoked and are lubricated by a tahini mayo and a nutty chilli oil or rayu, made with grains from the brewery. Grilled cauliflower florets come in a ripe, buttery Indian-accented mess of a sauce under ribbons of pickled onion. Meat and fish do not appear on the menu until the large plates. There’s mutton merguez with a wild garlic salsa verde, the ingredients for which I pray have not been harvested from the fox-sprayed canal verges of Dalston. There’s a Tamworth pork chop and a whole butterflied mackerel. We order the ox cheek. It’s the least whelming of dishes. The mustard greens have heft and there’s a powerful umami-tastic ancho chilli koji condiment. But the cheek simply hasn’t spent long enough on the grill. It fights back against the knife and fork. It almost wins. So much better is the hearth vegetable plate, a fabulous collection of beefy roasted tomatoes, courgettes and fennel, with white beans and squash purées, dressed with another big old salsa verde. This singular £14 dish makes the argument for the whole venture. It is a demonstration of the virtuous interplay of the best vegetables and the most acutely managed indirect heat and smoke. There is just one dessert tonight: a deep, dark chocolate ganache topped by hazelnuts and a beer molasses. It’s impressively powerful, but could have done with a soothing dollop of chilled whipped cream. It’s clear they want you to get deeply stuck into the brewery’s offering with this food: into beers with names like Dalston Sunset and Disco Pils, all at £5 or £6 a pint. There are only half a dozen wines, and the cheapest white, a dry Tokaj, is £38 a bottle, which is unfriendly. It’s also at odds with the reasonable food pricing. Perhaps they simply don’t care much about wine drinkers – which is, I suppose, fair enough. Then again, I came here for dinner, rather than for an act of unquestioning cultist worship. And dinner, a really engaging one, is what they gave me. I may not be a devout follower of the cult. I may not be on my knees before the blessed grill. But I do have faith. The onward march of top steak continues. Hawksmoor have announced that, following openings in Manchester, Edinburgh and New York, they are now expanding into Liverpool. The steakhouse group has always utilised grand buildings with history and the same is true again. Hawksmoor Liverpool will be located inside the Grade II-listed India Building on the corner of Brunswick and Fenwick Streets and will open later this year. ‘It’s an amazing site,’ co-founder Will Beckett has said. ‘We’re really excited to do it justice’ (thehawksmoor.com). The ever-interesting chef Jay Morjaria is on to his next project. Having finished his Korean-inspired residency JAE at Untitled bar in London’s Dalston in February, he has now opened at the Shelter Hall food market on Brighton’s seafront. Tiger and Rabbit offers Morjaria’s take on Korean barbecue, with rice, lettuce wraps and appropriate condiments, including samjang aioli and kimchi (shelterhall.co.uk). And while there are new openings, there’s also bleak news. According to accountancy firm Price Bailey, more than 1,300 British restaurant became insolvent in the year to the end of March 2022. This was a significant rise on the previous 12 months, when 926 restaurants went bust. The increase has been attributed to the end of the government’s various programmes to support the industry through the pandemic.

5/15/2022,"Nyetimber Queen’s Jubilee Limited-Edition Classic Cuvee Multi Vintage, (£37.50, nyetimber.com) Depending on whether you’re a royalist or a republican, the upcoming long weekend is either a four-day feast of pomp and circumstance or a small but welcome compensation for putting up with all the fundamentally undemocratic parasitism. But for drinks producers it’s also very much a marketing opportunity. Certainly, British drinks brands are lining up to make the most of the patriotic pound, with a flurry of special releases, events, promotions and the like. The English wine scene, which for the most part has a very Bake Off/Waitrose/Middle English vibe to its marketing, is inevitably at the forefront of making the most of the Royal moment and the accompanying expected boom in domestic tourism. Kent’s Gusbourne Estate, for example, is lining up a very British celebration, inviting guests to its rather lovely Boot Hill Garden from 30 May to 2 June for a Platinum Jubilee Sparkling Afternoon Tea for £100 for two, while rivals Nyetimber have gone for a specially labeled Platinum Jubilee bottling of its excellent Classic Cuvée. Luscombe Damascene Rose Bubbly (£21.30, 12 x 270ml, luscombe.co.uk) Other English wine contributions to the Platinum celebrations include Langham Wine Estate’s Jubilee Extravaganza, a “sumptuous buffet -style banquet of classic English and Dorset Fayre” put on in the grounds of this excellent Dorset sparkling producer on 5 June; while The Royal Collection has its very own Platinum Jubilee Special Edition English Sparkling Wine (£39, royalcollectionshop.co.uk). Another very British drink, gin, is also getting in on the act, with special bottlings from the likes of Cotswold’s Distillery, whose Limited Edition Platinum Jubilee Gin (which I’ve not tasted) is made with the very seasonal ingredients of strawberry and raspberry, as well as pink pepper. For Devon fruit drink producer (and Royal Warrant Holder) Luscombe, it’s a matter of helping out Kirstie Allsopp-style: the company is offering free “Street Party Boxes”, complete with bunting and paper cups, for anyone who buys two or more cases of fruit drinks – such as the delightful, gently floral Rose Bubbly – from its website and enters the code JUBILEE. Taylor’s Platinum Jubilee Very Very Old Tawny Port, Portugal NV (£290, bbr.com) Events such as the Jubilee are a bit like Manchester United or the Olympics in the sheer, ludicrous range of “official partners” willing to come on board. Inevitably in these Covid times there is an offical hygiene partner, as well as an array of posh and medium posh food brands and retailers, from M&S and Waitrose to Fortnm & Mason, plus the inevitable McDonald’s, which seems to be the official fast food for every event known to man or woman. For wine, big names include two French brands, Moët & Chandon and the delicate Provence rosé of Whispering Angel from Château d’Esclans, which is on elegant, incisive form in the Jubilee Edition 2021 vintage I tried (£20, Waitrose, Sainsbury’s, Majestic). By far the best of the Jubilee-marking drinks I’ve tried however is Taylor’s Very Very Rare and very very special (as it should be since it’s very very expensive) Tawny Port. A blend of Ports that have been ageing in cask “since the Queen acceded to the throne”, it’s full of life and endless mellow complexity.
