1/14/2022,"The combination of the voice of Veronica Bennett, who has died aged 78, and Phil Spector’s studio-built Wall of Sound became one of the most potent and distinctive sounds to emerge from the fast-changing world of pop music in the early 1960s. Ronnie Spector, as she became when she and the producer married, was the lead singer of the Ronettes, a New York trio whose hits included Be My Baby, Baby I Love You, (The Best Part of) Breakin’ Up and – her own favourite – Walking in the Rain. With their towering black beehive hairdos, extravagant eye makeup and tight sheath dresses, the Ronettes brought a whiff of sex and danger to the wholesome girl-group genre of the early 60s, previously dominated by the romantic songs of the Shirelles, the Chiffons and the Cookies. The sisters Veronica and Estelle Bennett and their cousin Nedra Talley projected an image that was a long way from any parent’s idea of a perfect prom date.  Among those they beguiled were the Beatles, whom they met at a party in Mayfair in 1964, and the Rolling Stones, with whom they toured the UK and hung out in New York. John Lennon took a particular shine to Ronnie as the American girls – who had begun as dancers in the Peppermint Lounge, a New York club – showed the four boys from Liverpool how to do the Pony, the Jerk and the Nitty Gritty. They dated in London, in a foursome made up by George Harrison and Estelle, sometimes accompanied by the girls’ mother, who was paying her first visit to London. Ronnie and John met again in the US, but her relationship with Spector was becoming more serious. Forty years after their heyday, the Ronettes – and Ronnie in particular – would inspire the look developed by Amy Winehouse, who piled her hair high and drew winglets at the corners of her eyes in homage to the style they created during their teenage years in Harlem. Veronica was the daughter of Louis Bennett, a subway worker, and his wife, Beatrice. He was white, she was black, and their combined ethnic heritage – African American, Native American, Irish – gave Veronica and her sister a paler skin tone and straighter hair than their fellow pupils at their Harlem school. “Hey, half-breed,” Veronica would be told, “get back on your reservation.” At one point she reacted by trying to dye her skin darker. Music was a significant presence in the family. Her father played the drums, and groups of aunts and uncles formed vocal trios and quartets. Veronica sang from an early age, accompanied Estelle, the elder by two years, to dance classes, and knew from the age of 12, when she heard Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, another bunch of Harlem teens, singing their hit Why Do Fools Fall in Love, that she wanted to be a performer. When Lymon, a star at 15, paid a visit to the Bennett house, she found herself having to resist his advances. Her father had left the household and moved to Florida, suffering from alcoholism, by the time she enrolled at George Washington high school, where she decided that wearing nice clothes was a route to popularity. To pay for them, she took an after-school job serving meals to patients in the geriatric ward of a local hospital. At 15 she, Estelle and three girl cousins, including Nedra, and a boy cousin, Ira, performed Lymon’s hit during an amateur night at the celebrated Apollo theatre. Ira was due to take the lead part; when he froze with nerves at the microphone, Veronica stepped forward and earned applause that, she remembered, “made me feel like a star”. Singing lessons for Veronica, Estelle and Nedra at a professional studio in midtown Manhattan led to a meeting with a songwriter, Stu Phillips, who gave them a song called What’s So Sweet About Sweet Sixteen and arranged for them to make their first records for the Colpix label. Two singles were released without success, but their career took a step forward when they auditioned as dancers at the Peppermint Lounge, a mob-run joint where celebrities were dancing the Twist to the music of Joey Dee and the Starliters. Despite being under the legal age to enter night clubs, and with tissue paper supplied by her mother to pad out the bras under their yellow taffeta dresses, they were hired. Plans for them to appear alongside Dee in a movie titled Hey, Let’s Twist! foundered on the casting director’s verdict: “They’re too light to play black girls and too dark to play white girls. We can’t use them.” But the influential disc jockey Murray the K put them on his shows at the Brooklyn Fox in the spring of 1962, which was when they started teasing their hair into upward coils and applying the mascara with a more emphatic touch. It was during the following year that they made a call to Phil Spector, whose hits with the Crystals (He’s a Rebel, Da Doo Ron Ron) and Bob B Soxx and the Blue Jeans (Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah) on his own Philles label had made him the hottest producer in pop. The Wagnerian scale of the orchestral arrangements on his records often threatened to overwhelm his singers, but in Veronica he found the perfect figure to stand atop his mountainous soundscapes. Ronnie’s voice, marked by a slow, wide vibrato, combined the sweet optimism of adolescence with a sultry undertone that hinted at a more knowing sophistication. When Spector unleashed his echo-swathed battalions on a song called Be My Baby, it gave the Ronettes an immediate smash hit – and one that made a profound impression on other would-be hitmakers, including Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, who listened to it endlessly. Now they were the stars they had dreamed of being, and Ronnie was falling for her svengali, who was still married to his first wife. It was not until 1968, after the string of hits had dried up and Spector’s sound had fallen out of favour, that they were married. After a first, fruitless attempt to revive her career with a single called You Came, You Saw, You Conquered on the A&M label, in 1969 they adopted a son, Donté, Spector having made his wife wear a pillow under her clothes in order to convince the world that she was giving birth. Phil Spector’s old friendship with the Beatles paid off when, in 1970, he was invited to finish off their Let It Be album and to produce solo records for Lennon and Harrison. He also took the opportunity to record one of Harrison’s songs, Try Some Buy Some, with Ronnie, again to minimal response, despite its release on the Beatles’ Apple label. By now the marriage had been undermined by Phil Spector’s pathological jealousy. He locked his wife up in their Beverly Hills mansion and took away her shoes, allowed her to go out in a car alone only with a model of himself in the passenger seat to deter interest from other men, and threatened her with guns (a presentiment of the murder in 2003 of Lana Clarkson, for which he would spend the rest of his life in jail). In 1972 he surprised Ronnie by presenting her with adopted twins, Gary and Louis, but within weeks, recognising that she and her husband were both suffering from alcohol addiction, she left him, after a violent exit in which her mother fought him off. A lengthy and contested divorce eventually came through and in 1975 she began an independent solo career, which was given impetus by the attention of fans including Bruce Springsteen, his lieutenant Steve Van Zandt and Billy Joel. A duet with Eddie Money called Take Me Home Tonight returned her to the charts in 1986. At 38 she had the first of two sons with Jonathan Greenfield, a stage production manager whom she had met in 1978. He became her manager and they married in 1982. In 1988 she and her fellow Ronettes began the long process of suing Phil Spector for unpaid royalties. An initial award of $2.6m (£1.9m) was overturned, but eventually a settlement was reached in which they received an estimated $1m. In 1990 Ronnie wrote an autobiography, Be My Baby: How I Survived Mascara, Miniskirts and Madness, and in 2007 the Ronettes were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Keith Richards. Ronnie released her final solo album, English Heart, in 2016. Estelle died in 2009. Ronnie is survived by her husband, her sons, Jason, Austin, Donté, Gary and Louis, and her cousin Nedra, the third Ronette.

1/14/2022,"Marks & Spencer may have once looked on the ropes but it has bounced back with its strongest festive period for years. The 138-year-old chain had its best ever Christmas on food and claimed its highest market share in full-price clothing since 2013 as shoppers emerging from last year’s lockdowns sought out the retailer.  On food, M&S has undoubtedly benefited from replacing Waitrose as Ocado’s retail partner. While its sales via Ocado were not included in Thursday’s trading update, the tie-up since September 2020 has raised the retailer’s profile with a younger audience and helped broaden its appeal. That deal built on and underpinned an existing effort to draw in family shoppers by cutting prices on basics, offering larger pack sizes and modernising its food ranges with more vegan and organic products. Sales of milk and cheese, for example, rose 12% this Christmas on two years ago. The food boss, Stuart Machin, has also stirred in a larger dose of fun by widening its use of in-house creations such as Percy Pig and Colin the Caterpillar, alongside new ideas such as snow globe gin and light-up shortbread biscuit tins, more than 1m of which were sold in December. However, the real turnaround is on fashion. This Christmas, M&S partly benefited from a general surge in clothing sales, with fewer restrictions on socialising this year prompting a national wardrobe refresh. M&S’s sales of bras surged by 13% and jeans by 12% as shoppers were able to try items in stores. Concerns about the environmental impact of fast fashion have also sparked more interest in M&S, which is known for its better quality, more durable garments. “There is a trend for longer-lasting products rather than disposable fashion continues to play to our strength,” Steve Rowe, the chief executive, said. M&S has also helped itself by improving its online service, after fixing serious problems at its main warehouse and tightening up its fashion ranges to offer fewer and better products, so it is less reliant on discounting. Online sales are up 50% on two years ago as M&S was able to capitalise on the general shift to ordering from home with slicker deliveries, including using stores to select and send products to customers for the first time this year. A new strategy of selling other brands online, such as FatFace, White Stuff and Hobbs, as well as collaborating with interesting adjacent brands such as Ghost and Nobody’s Child, is also likely to have drawn more shoppers to the website. Under the clothing and home boss Katie Bickerstaffe, the retailer has concentrated on getting its everyday basics, such as nightwear and knitwear, to look more stylishly accessible. Sales of those categories rose 25% and 5% respectively, despite M&S already being responsible for an enormous chunk of jumper sales each Christmas. It has also broadened its appeal by, for example, shifting the focus of its children’s clothing to affordable kit that is not just for special occasions, and introducing the successful Goodmove brand of exercise gear. Launched only two years ago, Goodmove has become M&S biggest own label, selling 1.6m items annually. “While clothing and home has formerly been M&S’s main handicap, it has now seemingly turned a corner in its overhaul,” said Pippa Stephens, a retail analyst at GlobalData. “As well as revamping its own-brand clothing ranges to be trendier and more inspiring, the incorporation of popular third-party brands like Nobody’s Child and Ghost has also helped it acquire new customers. These more appealing ranges will have allowed M&S to significantly reduce the proportion of products being discounted.”",News/Business,Fashion turnaround helps M&S celebrate Christmas in style ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/13/fashion-turnaround-marks-spencer-christmas-style-sales-covid
1/14/2022,"The folk musician Eliza Carthy has asked fans for financial support to aid her parents, celebrated musicians Martin Carthy and Norma Waterson, after their income from live performances “dried up” during the Covid-19 crisis. Waterson has long been unable to perform owing to illness, Eliza wrote on the fundraising website Ko-Fi, and is currently hospitalised with pneumonia.  “Right now the Carthy family, as many others, is struggling to survive the pandemic,” wrote Eliza, who moved closer to her parents 11 years ago in order to help care for Waterson. “They urgently need funds to tide them over until the pandemic lifts and Martin and Eliza can return to touring and again become self-sufficient.” Martin Carthy, 80, is one of the most influential musicians in British folk. He has released more than 40 albums as a solo artist, a member of Steeleye Span and the Albion Country Band, in collaboration with the late fiddle player Dave Swarbrick and with his wife and daughter as Waterson-Carthy. In 2014, he received the lifetime achievement award at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. He was named “arguably the greatest English folk song performer, writer, collector and editor of them all” by Q magazine, and inspired peers such as Bob Dylan and Paul Simon. Waterson, 82, is one of the original members of traditional group the Watersons and a collaborator with Richard Thompson and members of Pentangle along with her family members. She received the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards lifetime achievement prize in 2016. In December, UK Music chief executive Jamie Njoku-Goodwin wrote to chancellor Rishi Sunak about “the devastating impact the growth of the omicron variant is having on the UK music industry”. Many musicians have felt no choice but to postpone their immediate forthcoming tours given uncertainty over safety, including UK bands Wolf Alice and Blossoms, despite a lack of government support for cancelled events. A UK Music report published in October said that one in three jobs in the UK music industry were lost during the preceding 18 months of the Covid-19 pandemic. Martin and Eliza Carthy are due to play live throughout the UK this winter, with an intermittent run of dates kicking off in Durham on 27 January. Eliza wrote that she had recorded a new album during the pandemic, proceeds from which would also help the family. More than 2,500 people had supported the Carthy campaign at the time of publication. “I am a long-standing folk traditionalist,” wrote supporter Stephen Lyons. “Where would we be without these two? Eh? Love to them.”",Arts/Music,Carthy folk dynasty appeals for financial support after income ‘dried up’ during pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/13/carthy-folk-dynasty-appeals-for-financial-support-after-income-dried-up-during-pandemic
1/14/2022,"Nearly a quarter of the world’s population experienced a record hot year in 2021, as the climate crisis continues to unleash escalating temperatures around the globe, according to new data from leading US climate scientists.  Last year was the sixth hottest ever recorded, with the global temperature 1.1C above the pre-industrial average, a new annual analysis from Nasa and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) found. “Science leaves no room for doubt: climate change is the existential threat of our time,” said Bill Nelson, administrator of Nasa. While 2021 did not top the record heat set in 2020, which was only fractionally hotter than 2016, scientists said last year was yet another demonstration of the long-term global heating that is being caused by human activity, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is now at levels not seen on Earth in the past four million years. Earlier this week, the European climate agency Copernicus said 2021 was the fifth hottest year on record, with the last seven years the hottest ever documented. A slight edge was taken off last year’s temperatures by a La Nina, a periodic climatic event that cools the waters of the Pacific ocean. Despite not being the hottest individual year on record, 2021 did contain a number of extraordinary signs of climate breakdown. July last year was the world’s hottest month ever recorded, with Death Valley in California recording what may be the hottest temperature ever reliably measured during this month, at 54.4C (130F). A total of 1.8bn people, approaching a quarter of the world’s population, live in countries that did experience the hottest year on record, according to a separate analysis released on Thursday by Berkeley Earth. A total of 25 countries, including China, Nigeria and Iran, recorded a record warm annual average in 2021. “No one lives at the global average temperature,” said Robert Rohde, lead scientist at Berkeley Earth. “Most land areas will experience more warming than the global average, and countries must plan their responses to this.” Last year also saw a cascade of disasters that scientists have determined were worsened by the world’s excess heat. Floods devastated parts of Germany and China, while the Pacific north-west of North America saw an unprecedented, and deadly, heatwave that scientists said would have ben “virtually impossible” without climate change.",News/Environment,"Nearly quarter of world’s population had record hot year in 2021, data shows",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/13/hot-year-temperatures-climate-crisis-2021
1/14/2022,"Commercial debt management companies are placing Facebook adverts that could give the impression they are linked to official government schemes, Guardian analysis has found. Debt management companies help people consolidate and restructure their debts, charging customers fees for a solution or earning commission on referrals to debt advisers.  Debt advice charities can arrange management plans and other support for free. One such company, Stepchange, has described ads that promote debt write-off schemes containing logos similar to the government crest, placed by Facebook pages called WiseoldMary and Mums In Debt, as “deeply misleading”. Another Facebook page named itself Debt Respite Scheme UK, the same name as a government scheme that gives legal protection from creditor action for 60 days. Several Facebook pages also used images of Boris Johnson to promote their services. WiseoldMary and Debt Respite Scheme UK are “lead generators” for other companies and do not offer debt advice themselves but earn commission on referrals, according to their privacy policies. The cost-of-living crisis is likely to exacerbate the issue of problem debt in the UK, with Citizens Advice warning in November that one in ten families were at risk of serious financial hardship this winter. The Advertising Standards Authority ruled in 2020 that a series of adverts placed by TFLI Limited, which runs WiseoldMary, did not make sufficiently clear that they passed leads on to a third party and did not clearly state the potential fees and risks associated with solutions offered. A spokesperson for TFLI said internal processes had been changed after the rulings by the ICO and ASA and that running a credit broker did not prevent the company helping people in debt. The Facebook page and associated website for Debt Respite Scheme UK were taken down shortly after the Guardian approached Trifik Ltd, listed on the website as the data controller, for comment. A spokesperson for Trifik said: “The assets were removed at our client’s request as unfortunately they are no longer trading. “Facebook Ads guidelines were followed when running promotional ads on behalf of our client and the website stated that it was an independent website working with regulated advisers.” Guardian analysis of data from Facebook’s ad library found 35 pages offering debt management services advertising on Facebook, spending up to £100,000 a month in total. The Guardian also found two companies that advertised debt support while also running credit brokers and payday loan companies. While this is not illegal, customers may not be clear that the companies managing these pages are also credit brokers. Debt Solvo, which offers customers “an easy and stress-free way to finally solve that debt problem”, is a trading name of Nouveau Finance Limited, which runs a number of payday loan brokers. Payday SOS loans, Bizzy loans, and others owned by Nouveau Finance advertise an APR of up to 1721%. WiseoldMary is a trading name of TFLI Limited, which also runs a credit broker called “cheaploans.co.uk”. In 2018, the company was fined £80,000 by the Information Commissioner’s Office for sending more than 1m spam texts. A spokesperson for Stepchange said: “It’s a real problem working out which companies really sit behind the ads. Often these firms are lead generators at several removes from the firms who might actually set up a product for the client. “If you give your personal details over to one of these companies you may not know where the information is going or who’s going to then get in touch with you about that solution.” A number of the ads analysed by the Guardian claimed customers could write off “up to 85%” of their debts. A spokesperson for StepChange said: “It’s clearly an advertiser dangle – we do think it can be deeply misleading.” A spokesperson for TFLI Limited said: “We have worked consistently with the ASA to ensure that all our advertisements are clear and transparent. “We clearly inform customers that the average debt write-off using our service, based on actual data from our partners, and drawn from direct ASA advice, is 67% although it is absolutely possible to write off up to 81%. “With regards to your accusation that we are implying a direct affiliation with the government, we absolutely refute this claim. TFLI are simply referring to the fact that IVAs are a result of government debt legislation.” Mums in Debt and Nouveau Finance Limited did not respond to requests for comment.",Lifestyle/Money,Debt advice charity condemns ‘misleading’ write-off ads on Facebook,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/13/debt-advice-charity-condemns-misleading-write-off-ads-on-facebook
1/14/2022,"Geva Mentor has warned England’s Roses not to read too much into Australia’s lack of international action or their new-look squad before the start of the Netball Quad Series this weekend. Excitement has been rising in the buildup to the first Quad Series for three years with the Diamonds travelling to the UK with a new head coach, Stacey Marinkovich, alongside a handful of new caps and a lack of international gametime over the past two years. But Mentor, the 37-year-old former England captain who has played in Australia for nearly a decade, believes this could make the Australians even more dangerous when the five-day, four-nation tournament gets under way at London’s Copper Box on Saturday.  “The team that’s unexpected is a lethal team,” she says. “Every single player in the Diamond side are elite at what they do. This is probably the first time the Diamonds have brought a team that has got so much versatility.” However, Mentor does add a caveat. “Yes, individually their team is really strong but together, how does that fit gel?” England, New Zealand and South Africa will all be wondering. Usually, Australia would be a sure bet to win the Quad Series; even though they’ve lost the Commonwealth and World Cup titles in the past four years, they did so by just one goal each time. They are a relatively unknown quantity this time out, so it is the hosts who find themselves going into the tournament as favourites thanks to their recent wins over Jamaica and New Zealand. It is a position unfamiliar not only to the Roses, who until their breakthrough gold at the 2018 Commonwealth Games were regularly thrashed by the teams either side of the Tasman, but also to Mentor, who first donned England colours back in 2001. How the Roses will fare with the pressure of being top pick is another of the key questions waiting to be answered in the series. The Silver Ferns, the reigning world champions, will look to show what they have learned since England’s historic win on their turf in September last year, while South Africa are dogged on the court even without star players Karla Pretorius, Lenize Potgeiter and Shadine Van der Merwe, and will no doubt be thinking about next year’s World Cup hosting duties. Over the five days, the four teams will face a round of head-to-heads culminating in a final and a third/fourth-place play-off. The format is physically gruelling and will be an ideal barometer of progress for the world’s best in the lead-up to this summer’s Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. “The quick transitions playing four games in five days and every single nation is going to be bloody tough,” says Mentor. “How do we debrief quickly? How do we learn from what we put out there to then move forward and take it into a different style?” England do have to contend with an unplanned player absence following shooter Jo Harten’s positive Covid-19 test result. However, under Jess Thirlby England can now turn to the likes of Jamaica series standout Eleanor Cardwell or Georgia Fisher to replace Harten, and that depth, for Mentor, is what distinguishes this Roses side from previous squads. “This is probably one of the toughest teams to pick,” she says. “I’ve been in England sides before where you can pretty much name your starting eight, maybe nine and then there’s a few others you can put in there. Now we’ve got 15, 16, almost up to 20 athletes that you could actually put in and bring something different into the squad, which is great.” The final question worth asking is: to what standard should the Roses be held come the conclusion of the series? The answer for the defending Commonwealth champions can only be: the highest. “We want go out and win,” says Mentor. “How great would it be to have this practice at being a favourite and actually coming through with the goods to back it up for Comm Games?” Should the Roses walk away first-time winners of this year’s Quad Series then their campaign in July will truly be bolstered. Anything less and tough questions will follow.",Sport/Sport,England’s Geva Mentor wary of Australia in Netball Quad Series,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/13/england-netball-legend-geva-mentor-quad-series-london
1/14/2022,"Newcastle United unveiled their second purchase of the January transfer window on Thursday morning and for the many fans hoping to see the club – who recently swapped one tyrannical ownership regime for a far more unsavoury one – slide out of the Premier League it must seem disappointingly shrewd. In signing Chris Wood for £25m from Burnley, Newcastle have not only got themselves a grafter who is generally good for 10 or more goals a season, but also weakened direct relegation rivals who are believed to be spitting feathers at the loss of a striker who still has at least seven goals left in his account for the current campaign.  While we can only speculate as to how apoplectic with spittle-flecked rage most Newcastle fans would have been if Steve Bruce had spent this much to bring somebody as unfashionable as Wood to St James’ Park under the previous administration, many seem to be reserving their ire for the naysayers on social media disgraces who say the 30-year-old could scarcely be less box-office if he changed his name by deed poll to Hudson Hawk. As things stand, the transfer certainly constitutes “a good signing” in so far as Newcastle wanted Wood and have now got Wood, and with that half of the battle won, only time and results will tell if he was worth a fee that might seem a lot of money to your cash-strapped Fiver. While Burnley manager Sean Dyche is understood to be furious that Wood has not only left Burnley but signed for fellow strugglers, it had been widely reported the club had no option but to sell because a release clause in his contract had been triggered by their canny rivals. In the past two days, however, TalkSport sidekick Simon Jordan has claimed he has it on good authority said clause only related to summer transfers, a state of affairs that – if true – would leave Burnley’s hierarchy facing potentially tricky questions from their fans. “I don’t actually know the wording or anything like that,” knocked Wood. “I knew it had been sitting in there from the day that we agreed a new deal two-and-a-half years ago, but my agents know more about that and that side of it. I just get on playing football. I don’t really worry about what’s in the contract and that sort of thing.” It was the correct answer from a man who may receive a less-than-warm welcome when he returns to Turf Moor for what could prove to be quite the crucial final game of the season. For now though, Wood will be rapturously received as the latest in a long line of potential new messiahs when he runs out to face Watford at St James’ Park in another six-pointer on Saturday afternoon.

1/14/2022,"Clean air campaigners have warned leaders in Greater Manchester that pausing plans to charge polluting vehicles in the region “would be a serious blow for people’s health”. Greater Manchester authorities announced plans on Thursday to ask the government to partially delay the rollout of the biggest clean air zone in the UK, citing evidence that global supply chain issues could increase the costs and reduce the availability of cleaner vehicles.  The first phase of the zone, designed to tackle illegal levels of air pollution, will go ahead as planned in May. It will cover 10 local authority areas and will charge buses, HGVs and some taxis to enter the zone. Unlike clean air zones in Birmingham and London’s Ulez, Greater Manchester decided to exempt the 285,000 private cars licensed in the region that already breach air pollution limits, as well as mopeds and motorbikes. Lorries, buses and coaches that breach nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions standards will be asked to pay £60 per day, while vans, taxis and minibuses will be charged from £7.50 to £10 to combat the 1,200 premature deaths caused in the region by breathing dirty air. There are 152 locations across the 10 local authority areas with illegal levels of NO2. In a statement, Andy Burnham said ministers will be asked to “undertake an urgent and fundamental review of the policy for the second phase of the clean air zone”. The mayor of Greater Manchester also asked the government to consider excluding motorhomes and horseboxes. The government has awarded £120m in funding to help those eligible switch to cleaner, compliant vehicles, but Burnham has said it is not enough to support those on the lowest incomes with the oldest cars. “Everyone in Greater Manchester deserves to breathe clean air but we have always said this cannot be at the expense of those who cannot afford to upgrade their vehicles to make them compliant in this timeframe,” he said. “Clean air can only be achieved by the right package of financial support to help people upgrade their vehicles, and this latest evidence highlights significant challenges in this area. We are worried about what this could mean for those businesses and individuals impacted, and their ability to upgrade as well as our ability to deliver the clean air plan.” The mayor added that he was listening to those who had been in touch. On Wednesday, campaigners boarded a bus with a sheep and a Shetland pony to demonstrate their opposition to the plans, while a petition in favour of scrapping the CAZ has amassed more than 25,000 signatures. Other critics include cab drivers, farmers and small business owners, who say the costs of the scheme could be insurmountable. The children’s health campaign group Mums for Lungs wrote to Burnham on Thursday, expressing concerns at any delay to the scheme. “Manchester’s children deserve the same commitment” as that shown by London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, they wrote. One of the signatories, Ruth Todhunter of Little Lungs, based in Levenshulme in Manchester, said that Burnham had posed for a photograph alongside children campaigning for cleaner air at the COP26 conference in Glasgow last year. “How can you have that photograph taken and then possibly delay the clean air zone?” she said. Katie Nield, a lawyer at the environmental law charity ClientEarth, said that “pausing plans for a CAZ would be a serious blow for people’s health, especially for those on low incomes, who suffer disproportionately from the impacts of toxic air”. The charity, which took the government to court three times, resulting in a 2018 judgment forcing ministers to draw up plans to bring air pollution levels within legal limits in the shortest possible time, said that if the delay was approved, it would not “hesitate to act to stop [it] happening”. “Cleaning the air is a moral obligation, which should be enough of a motivation for the region’s leaders. However, there is also a legal obligation, in place to protect people’s health,” Nield said.",News/UK news,Campaigners warn against plan to delay Manchester clean air zone,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/13/campaigners-warn-against-plan-to-delay-manchester-clean-air-zone
1/14/2022,"Humanitarian organisations in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia are running perilously low on food and fuel stocks as an intensified wave of airstrikes further hampers a threadbare aid effort already stymied by lack of access. In what it calls a de facto blockade, the UN says fighting between Tigrayan rebels and forces loyal to the Ethiopian government has rendered the main supply route into the war-torn region unusable since mid-December.  Diminishing supplies of fuel are causing particular concern as, without sufficient supplies, humanitarian workers are unable to distribute already meagre food stocks to a region where hundreds of thousands of people are thought to be living in famine-like conditions. The UN says it needs to distribute basic food supplies to 870,000 people in Tigray every week to reach 5.2 million in a six-week cycle. It says, however, that it only has enough food in the region for 200,000 people, and there is not enough fuel to deliver even that. As of Monday, the UN said its food partners had less than 7,000 litres of fuel left in Tigray, excluding contingency stock. To deliver the food supplies it would require 60,000 litres. An aid worker said: “We need 90 trucks of food every day and another 10 trucks of other supplies every day. So that’s 100 trucks every day. We haven’t had that since July.” Since mid-December, when the road from Semera in the neighbouring Afar region to the Tigrayan capital, Mekelle, became unusable, even that trickle of supplies has dried up. Claire Nevill, WFP’s spokesperson in Ethiopia, said: “WFP hasn’t been able to get humanitarian supplies into Tigray since mid-December and our food and fuel stocks are running perilously low. We’ve already had to scale down food distributions to the communities and prioritise remaining fuel stocks for delivering urgently needed nutrition treatment for children. “We need guarantees from all parties to the conflict of safe and secure humanitarian corridors via all routes into the region immediately, so supplies can flow in and reach millions in need of life-saving assistance at scale.” Aid workers say the shortage of fuel is also further impeding healthcare services, which are already extremely stretched because of a lack of supplies. A measles vaccination programme for children under five, for example, will have severe limitations, one humanitarian worker said, because staff will be unable to travel to rural areas. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, said on Wednesday he was deeply concerned about the deadly combined effect of airstrikes and a lack of medicine and food on the civilian population of Tigray. “There is a blatant measure that’s being taken – a blockade and siege – for more than a year, [affecting] 7 million people, and since especially July, no medication was allowed from WHO. None whatsoever,” said Tedros, himself from the northern Ethiopian region. “Nowhere in the world are we witnessing hell like in Tigray,” he said. Dr Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergencies programme, said it was an “insult to our humanity, to allow a situation like this to continue, to allow no access, zero access”. Since the prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, ordered a military action in Tigray in November 2020, the conflict has been marked by accusations of widespread human rights abuses, some of which the UN has said may amount to war crimes. On Thursday the Norwegian committee that awards the Nobel peace prize issued a very rare admonition to Abiy, who won in 2019 in part for making peace with neighbouring Eritrea. “Abiy Ahmed has a special responsibility to end the conflict and contribute to peace,” the committee said. “It is unacceptable that humanitarian aid is not emerging to a sufficient degree.” As the fighting has spread, so too has the humanitarian strife, with the number of people classed as “food insecure” in the region of Amhara, south-west of Tigray, doubling, from 1.5 million in June to an estimated 3.7 million now. In recent days repeated airstrikes are believed to have resulted in the highest civilian casualties since October, with more than 70 people killed in multiple strikes so far this year, according to medical and aid workers. A strike on a refugee camp on 5 January reportedly killed three Eritreans, two of them children, while a strike on a flour mill in Mai Tsebri on Monday killed 17, mostly women. On 7 January a night-time drone strike on a camp for internally displaced people in Dedebit killed at least 56 people, injuring dozens more, aid workers and medical staff said. The Ethiopian government has previously denied targeting civilians. The Dedebit airstrike came just hours after Abiy was credited with making a gesture towards peace by releasing several Tigrayan political prisoners. Gezahegn Kebede Gebrehana, the country director of Oxfam in Ethiopia, said: “We are alarmed by the continued reported deaths of unarmed people in the northern Ethiopia conflict. The continued violence means that humanitarian agencies in northern Ethiopia are unable to provide lifesaving assistance to the best of their abilities. “Oxfam calls on all parties to de-escalate the conflict, prioritise the safety of civilians, re-establish basic and adequate public services, and allow communities in affected areas to safely access available assistance and resources to survive and rebuild their lives.”",News/Global development,Warning over fuel and food stocks as ‘hellish’ Tigray reels from airstrikes,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/13/warning-fuel-and-food-stocks-hellish-tigray-reels-from-airstrikes
1/14/2022,"As consumers, we have increasingly grown more accustomed to shopping online – but we’ve also become more adept at it. Which means it isn’t enough for retailers to just cater for e-commerce consumers – they also need to take into account their savviness. “What the pandemic has done is accelerate the journey that we were already on,” says Kirsty Morris, managing director of specialist sales at Barclaycard Business. “If you look at the past 10 years, it’s not hard to see a shift in consumer behaviour toward being much more comfortable shopping online.”  For businesses, keeping both new and old e-commerce customers happy is vital for retaining their custom. As such, the e-commerce space has become a “real battleground” over the past 18 months, says Morris, as it is “forcing retailers to create even better online experiences”. Clunky websites are likely to make online shoppers run a virtual mile, whereas slick user experiences could win their loyalty. “There is genuine value, for a consumer, in having a really nice experience,” says Morris. “If I have a positive experience when I first come to a website, I might not even bother looking elsewhere.” Fast, frictionless payments – one-click payment processes that minimise purchase barriers, such as the need to enter card details – are also a must for increasingly demanding e-commerce customers. “The most successful retailers, going back over the past five or 10 years, are the ones where payment is slick,” says Morris. Payment solutions need to create a simple checkout experience for customers by storing card details securely for future frictionless payments. Morris says: “Mobile handset manufacturers have done a massive amount in this space as well to make the handset better and the interface better, so that it stores your card details in a secure way.” Consumers also expect delivery options that will suit their lifestyle – such as home delivery for home workers, or click and collect for those working from the office. It’s all part of the personalised experience people now want from online retailers. “If I’ve shopped with you before, I expect to be able to come back and you should know me, you should know what I want, and you should know how I want to pay,” says Morris. It doesn’t matter what sales channel a customer uses; they’ll expect the same high-quality, personalised experience regardless. That’s because, from a consumer’s perspective: “I don’t care if I’m shopping with you online on a desktop computer or on my phone, or if I’m on a phone shopping with you in a store,” says Morris. “It’s just my shopping experience with you, Mr Retailer, and you should be able to handle that.” As well as nudging more people to shop online, the pandemic also encouraged manufacturers to offer direct-to-consumer sales. In fact, research by Barclays shows that 57% of consumers are now choosing to buy directly from manufacturers, citing better prices and better service as factors in their decision. The most frequently bought items through the “direct approach” are clothes (39%), electronics (30%), and food and drink (27%), as well as larger items such as household appliances (24%) and furniture (22%). Shoppers are increasingly comfortable buying goods from overseas, too, providing they know they will receive them in a reasonable time frame and delivery doesn’t cost a small fortune. Solutions such as Barclaycard Multicurrency have helped to enable this shift by allowing more businesses to accept payments from cardholders in their local currency. “Regardless of Brexit, the online transacting space is easier in many ways than it’s ever been,” says Morris. Savvy online shoppers are also using comparison sites and other tools to nab the best deals. Thanks to the wealth of reviews and product videos now available, customers are increasingly comfortable researching and buying big-ticket items too – though they may want the option to view something in store before making a purchase. However, retailers shouldn’t bank on a mass return to the high street. “It’s not like stores reopened and everybody rushed back in,” says Morris. “We saw people wanting to go shopping in a physical environment, definitely. But it wasn’t a cliff-edge ‘I’m done with online, it was rubbish, I can’t wait to go back in-store’.” So, in a more competitive online space, how else can retailers further differentiate themselves from their rivals? One way is through their loyalty schemes, says Morris. Barclaycard’s commerce platform helps to build other digital connections between consumers and retailers. Retailers could, for example, offer discounts via the Barclays mobile banking app, or add digital receipts and loyalty points to a customer’s Barclays wallet. These integrations will ultimately make life easier for online shoppers and, together with slicker, more personalised experiences, ensure that even the savviest of them become loyal customers.

1/14/2022,"Chris Wood has readily admitted he never envisaged a club triggering the £25m release clause in his contract at Burnley but, once Newcastle United activated it, he felt powerless to say no to Saudi Arabian-controlledclub. “I knew the clause was sitting there but I don’t think anyone ever thought it would ever be triggered,” said the New Zealand striker, hours after becoming the most expensive 30-year-old signing in Premier League history. “But that’s the way football can be sometimes … You never know, in six months’ time you might look back and say: ‘That was a great deal.’”  Burnley, and their manager Sean Dyche, most definitely did not want to sell Wood to a key Premier League relegation rival and, judging by the current mood at Turf Moor, he may not receive the warmest of welcomes when Newcastle visit on the final day of the season. “For me, there’s no bad blood,” Wood said. “It wasn’t an easy decision and, to be honest, I wish I’d left when Burnley were further up the league but that’s just how football is sometimes. I spent four and a half years great years at Burnley. Every single year I really enjoyed myself there. My teammates, the staff and the club as a whole were fantastic. “I have nothing but great memories of Burnley but it was a case that this was a massive opportunity at a massive club and something I couldn’t turn down. It’s a great opportunity for me.” Burnley and Newcastle are level on 11 points in 18th and 19th place respectively but Dyche’s team hold two games in hand. “I’m only thinking about one thing and and that’s fighting hard to stay in this league with Newcastle,” said Wood after signing a two-and-a-half year deal. “I think we’ve got more than enough quality but we need to start showing that on the pitch and getting [positive] results sooner rather than later. “I’m under no illusions Newcastle is going to be a big challenge for me but I know it can be potentially great for the club and for me. I’m a firm believer that you have to get out of your comfort zone to achieve greatness – or some sort of great footballing talent.” Wood becomes Eddie Howe’s second signing behind Kieran Trippier, and the Newcastle manager is now hoping Sevilla accept his board’s renewed bid for their Brazilian central defender Diego Carlos.",Sport/Football,Newcastle’s Chris Wood admits he never imagined £25m release fee being paid,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/13/newcastle-chris-wood-admits-he-never-imagined-25m-release-fee-being-paid-burnley
1/14/2022,"In retrospect, the first season of Cheer felt a little like the last good thing to happen to humanity. It blazed in out of nowhere in January 2020; a scrubbed-up, more accessible version of American football series Last Chance U, and effortlessly won over a world that didn’t know what was about to hit it. A documentary series about the world of competitive college cheerleading, it was not only spectacular to watch – brimming with sequences of young women being pinged miles into the air without a safety net – but packed full of heart. There was a joy to Cheer, and the grab bag of underdog stories it chose to tell. This week, the second series of Cheer dropped on Netflix and, well, the first season of Cheer still feels like the last good thing to happen to humanity. What a weird, unbalanced, curdled few hours of television this is. Just like the rest of the world, Cheer has spent the past two years growing shapeless and morose. It still qualifies as appointment TV, just don’t expect to actually enjoy any of it.  Part of the issue is that world events conspired to break Cheer apart. You can get a sense of what the show was supposed to be like by sitting through its first four episodes. They begin where the last season ended, in a cavalcade of life-changing success. The Navarro College cheer squad has won the prestigious nationals at Daytona Beach and dominate all they survey. What’s more, their Netflix show has turned the entire squad into overnight celebrities, and everyone wants a piece of them. They meet Ellen! They hang out with Oprah! They spend every free moment recording Cameo videos for $50 a pop! The message seems to be: these kids have reached the top, but can they retain their focus long enough to stay there? Here’s the thing: we never find out. And that’s because – after watching the squad train and fight and sweat and vomit in preparation for the next set of nationals – Covid comes sweeping into town and everything gets shut down. Daytona Beach. Navarro. Cheer production. Everything. It all comes screeching to a halt, robbing the show of any semblance of a neat arc. And so, for the season’s final four episodes, we begin anew. We have skipped a year and Navarro are in training for the 2021 nationals. By necessity, this involves a heavy personnel change. Some of the show’s best-loved characters have now finished college and left without a proper goodbye, and in their place are a clutch of bright young things who never quite get the time to properly familiarise themselves. To offset this, the producers smartly devote a portion of time to Trinity Valley Community College, the raggedy neighbouring upstarts who see themselves as Rocky Balboa to Navarro’s Netflix-bloated Ivan Drago. It means that, when the nationals do finally take place, you find yourself with torn allegiances. It isn’t the neatest way to go about things, but as a necessary workaround it is pretty effective. But the reason you’ll watch Cheer this year is the episode that sits between these two halves. Entitled Jerry, it is as gut-wrenching an hour of television as you are ever likely to see. If you happened to follow the news at the time, you will know that season one’s breakout star Jerry Harris – a joyful effervescent figure whose charismatic interjections on Cheer made him a prime candidate for mainstream fame – was arrested in September 2020, accused of production of child pornography; then, when more teens came forward, soliciting sex and explicit photos from minors. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. This is the episode where the show attempts to deal with it all. For the most part, it succeeds. Much of the hour is handed over to the alleged victims; two twins who were 13 years old when they first met Harris. They, and their devastated mother, patiently detail how Harris introduced himself to them, what he asked them to do, and the uphill struggle they faced getting anybody to believe them. It is a profoundly upsetting thing to watch, due to the predatory nature of the allegations and the culture of silence when it comes to child abuse in the sport. This is where the episode falls down. It is long on testimonies from Navarro alumni who are shocked that a bad apple like Harris could have slipped through the cracks, but the most rudimentary Googling will reveal that he is far from alone. Just months after his arrest, two more Navarro figures were also arrested. One of them, Robert Joseph Scianna Jr, pleaded guilty to charges of indecency with a child. This hints at something grotesquely institutional, and the episode could have had much more impact by digging just that bit deeper. And, in viewing terms, the episode wildly unbalances the season. By not dealing with Jerry Harris upfront, you feel as though Cheer wants to spend four hours ignoring the elephant in the room. And then, once it’s done, diving straight back into the trivial world of cheerleading can’t help but feel crass. Should it return, we can hope that season three of Cheer will stay on the tracks and recover some of its old magic. But for now, it has given us a dark and knotty show for a dark and knotty time. It isn’t particularly pleasant, but there’s still value in it.",Arts/Television & radio,"‘Weird, unbalanced, curdled television’: how Netflix’s Cheer was ruined",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/13/weird-unbalanced-curdled-television-how-netflixs-cheer-was-ruined
1/14/2022,"It can sometimes feel as though shopping was simpler in the past. There were goods; there was cash; and – voilà! – a transaction. Now, with myriad ways to pay for something – from your smartphone to your smartwatch – having more choice can seem complicated. And it’s not just shoppers who feel bemused. According to the Office for National Statistics, online sales hit a record high of 38% of all retail spending last January, up from 20% in January 2020 before the first pandemic-related lockdowns. So it’s no surprise that businesses are thinking about payment systems – and how to make the process smoother.  All businesses accepting electronic payments online, no matter how small, require the virtual equivalent of a credit and debit card reader to make that happen – a one-stop solution to handling virtual transactions, from online grocery shopping to selling a round in a pub via an app. In other words, they need what’s known as a payment gateway. As consumers who increasingly shop online, we’re mostly blissfully ignorant of the technology that makes this possible. However, for businesses it’s crucial to understand the importance of what’s going on behind the scenes of each transaction. “People don’t actually take much interest in the technology behind what’s happening,” says Jackie Allen, director of gateway product management at Barclaycard Business. “In the simplest terms, payment gateways are the technology that captures payment data from the cardholder and authorises that payment through the acquirer to the issuer. It all happens in milliseconds.” In essence, a payment gateway authorises credit card or direct payments processing for businesses, and ensures enough funds are available for the retailer to get paid. “As cardholders, we’re looking for convenience,” says Allen. “Payment gateways are important to [the retailer] because they have to make it easy for the cardholder to pay: whether that’s on a mobile phone, getting in and out of a taxi, shopping online or going into a store. Having a payment gateway enables merchants to provide a unified experience.” Research by Barclaycard shows that 44% of UK consumers will abandon a purchase if their preferred payment method isn’t available, and 58% say they would stop a purchase altogether if the checkout process is complicated. “If merchants [retailers] haven’t got a gateway or a webpage that is seamless to the consumer, you get cart abandonment – when a customer puts everything in their shopping basket and then goes: ‘I’ll go back to that later’,” says Allen. “Then you have a merchant that was expecting to sell goods and doesn’t.” Luckily, a range of associated products in the Barclaycard commerce platform can help merchants get a better handle on these problems, and can provide them with data that tells them what percentage of people abandon their online shopping carts. Sometimes, Allen says, merchants can be too cautious when it comes to fraud, which risks them losing business. “If the merchant has overly stringent fraud rules, we could give them the analysis that shows that this is resulting in declining genuine purchasers unnecessarily.” Transact, a product in the Barclaycard commerce platform, can help merchants fine tune their payments and filter out the fraud. It helps to confirm someone is who they say they are when inputting their card details, and can conduct a risk analysis to check if the shopper can pay. If the risk level is low, the transaction will skip strong customer authentication (SCA) checks, which can require customers to take extra steps to confirm their identity, and authorise the purchase. This can help to create a frictionless payment journey and reduce the risk of the shopping cart being abandoned. In March, retailers will have to implement SCA for card-based e-commerce transactions under rules from the Financial Conduct Authority. Tools like this are essential to merchants – but ultimately you need a payment gateway in order to benefit from them. Now that people aren’t just buying goods but are also buying “experiences”, payment gateways are more important than ever, says Allen. “If you go to the pub, you can order at the table with an app. That’s changing the online shopping experience. Paying with a stored card makes it easier and quicker to get your drinks served. It can potentially drive more loyalty to [the establishment] as well.” For both merchant and shopper, payment gateways really are as simple as opening your wallet to pay for something. “A merchant’s day job is selling goods,” says Allen. “They shouldn’t be worried about fraud or compliance or regulations. Payment gateways take a lot of pain away from the merchant.” To find out more about how payment gateways can create a frictionless experience for your customers, click here",Retail reimagined,The gateway to growth: the invisible systems transforming e-commerce,https://www.theguardian.com/retail-reimagined/2022/jan/13/the-gateway-to-growth-the-invisible-systems-transforming-e-commerce
1/14/2022,"It used to be a rule of thumb that the less time someone had to wait for an online delivery, the more likely they were to commit to buying. But new ways of living and working mean that online norms are changing. For instance, next day delivery isn’t always optimum in a world of hybrid working that combines some days in the office and some days working from home. Assumptions and practices have been upended by the growth of online shopping as a result of the Covid pandemic. Research by Barclaycard found that shopping online proved popular throughout 2021, growing 63% since 2019 compared with face-to-face retail spending, which saw a smaller rise of 0.6%. As a leading global payment business, Barclaycard processes nearly £1 in every £3 spent using credit and debit cards in the UK.  “Quick delivery is a modern expectation of shopping online,” says Nick Carroll, associate director of grocery and e-commerce research at Mintel. “This is something that the pandemic has only served to intensify.” But retailers increasingly need to consider when shoppers would really like their order, which isn’t the same as assuming they would like it as soon as possible. “Speed is important, but equally as important is choice,” says Carroll. “Not all products are required immediately, but all deliveries are desired when the customer is available to receive them. That is why alongside speed efficiencies we are seeing more businesses look to provide more accurate delivery information, from real time updates to shortened delivery windows. Indeed, 30% of shoppers now say that exact delivery slots would encourage them to shop with one retailer over another.” Paul Martin, head of retail at KPMG, says the key thing is to get better at knowing your customer: “It’s really important to understand who the customer is and why they are making a purchase decision. The big challenge is that most retailers don’t know enough about you as an individual consumer, and even if they do, they don’t always understand your shopping mission. That will be a big area of future investment, with all of the caveats around data protection.” One way to potentially gain more insights is through the digitisation of receipts, with products such as Barclays Digital Receipts. According to one survey, more than 11bn receipts are produced in the UK each year, but more than 90% are lost, damaged or discarded. As well as being costly and environmentally damaging, these receipts are a missed opportunity for businesses to gain valuable data and insight about who their customers are and how they shop. Once you better understand your customers, delivering on a customer’s specified date and during their desired time slot still requires speed – after all, efficiency begets timeliness. For an order to turn up quickly, every aspect of the transaction needs to run seamlessly: from the payment process via a gateway to locating the stock in the warehouse and getting it out for delivery. Or to use retailer parlance: first mile, which involves getting hold of the stock from factories; middle mile, the bit in the warehouse, where orders are picked; and last mile, when the goods are on their way to someone’s home. One way for retailers to speed up the process is to automate their warehouses and invest in robotics to get orders ready to ship more quickly, says Miya Knights, publisher of Retail Technology magazine. “We’re seeing robotic supply chain providers get lots of funding and grow incredibly quickly.” Ultimately, however, speedy deliveries are all about being efficient, especially during the crucial last-mile stage. “We are seeing greater investment in smaller, but closer-to-shopper fulfilment centres, cutting down last-mile times,” says Carroll. “Stores are also increasingly being used as ways to shorten last-mile delivery times, with grocery in particular embracing courier-based platform partners to achieve this since the pandemic hit.” Martin warns that the biggest challenges are usually expected in the final mile. “[Retailers] still need a delivery vehicle and a driver, and that is a fixed cost that is comparatively expensive. Using a third-party logistics fulfilment provider to service that final mile means handing over a very significant chunk of margin.” Pioneering online retailers have shaped customer expectations when it comes to online shopping. For example, “Amazon raised expectations, and rapid delivery has become a competitive differentiator,” says Knights. Another aspect retailers can get right more easily is to ensure the buying experience is simple for customers. A payment gateway should offer customers low-friction, user-friendly pathways to make easy, quick and secure payments. And this will ultimately help avoid abandoned shopping carts. As many as 70% are abandoned, according to research by the Baymard Institute, which analyses online user experiences. Not all of those will be lost purchases as some will be from people who were simply browsing or doing price comparisons. But a significant chunk of abandoned carts will still represent lost sales. Since the start of 2021, almost 4 million UK consumers have actively used open banking-enabled products, such as Barclays Bank Pay, which lets customers pay straight from their bank account, instead of using card details. The product can help to simplify the payment journey and reduce cart abandonment, by making it easy for shoppers to access their online bank account from either their mobile or their desktop computer to finish their transaction. Whether it’s the payment process or the logistics that lie behind delivery slots, it all comes back to tailoring your service to the customer.

1/14/2022,"It is one of the most inaccessible guesthouses in Britain, on a tiny Hebridean island that is home to 15 people and a two-hour sail from the mainland. Undaunted, more than 100 people have inquired about running the place. Interest about taking over Tighard guesthouse on Canna, an island south-west of Skye just 4.5 miles long and one mile wide, came from across the world. The island’s owners, the National Trust for Scotland (NTS), are now whittling those down to a shortlist of 10 applicants.  Gaelic for high house, Tighard sits on a hill with a commanding view over Canna’s shallow bay, a natural harbour that in the summer months can be crowded by yachts touring the inner Hebrides. The guesthouse has picture-postcard views of Rùm, framed in the distance by the mountains of Skye and the western Highlands, its skies patrolled by eagles and seabirds. But applicants have also been warned that living on Canna, which is part of the Small Isles archipelago that includes Eigg, can be challenging and lonely. Canna’s isolation, its small and close-knit Gaelic-speaking community, long winters and tempestuous weather means incomers need to be resilient and adaptable. Tighard, an Edwardian villa built in 1904, has only one private bedroom, ruling out couples with children. With only three ferries a week in the winter and four in summer – a service dependent on weather and the reliability of CalMac’s ageing ferry fleet – and three guest rooms to service in high season, the new leaseholders will be expected to provide breakfasts and dinners and share their living room with guests. Jim Whyteside, a spokesperson for NTS, said the trust had been “thrilled by the quality and diversity” of the applicants. “It comes down to two things. Firstly, the reality of island life, from getting supplies to getting a break from work, fitting in with the community and helping the community meet its aspirations,” he said. “People have to understand that what they’re taking on. It is not an escape. You’re going to be working very hard. “Second, what can you bring to that community? There may be skills and other attributes it will value, because that’s very much part of becoming one with the community. Everyone is very serious about making sure that that can happen.” The 10 applicants have each been asked to produce a business case which will be scrutinised by NTS staff, before a shortlist is selected. Those shortlisted will then be taken to Canna for a tour and to meet the island’s community development trust, before hopefully moving in around Easter, in time for the summer season. This testing recruitment process was introduced after NTS oversaw disastrous attempts a decade ago to find new islanders to bolster Canna’s declining population, including one worldwide competition that attracted 350 applicants. Annoyed by strict rules restricting housebuilding on the island, previous incomers had been ill-prepared and had quit the island in anger, alleging they were misled about what was involved. In 2017, NTS changed tack and gave islanders greater say over how Canna was run and its services modernised. The island’s development trust is now building new homes for rent, has installed solar panels and a wind turbine, and hopes to double its population to about 30 permanent residents.

1/14/2022,"The Queen has been asked by more than 150 military veterans to strip Prince Andrew of his honorary military roles amid what they described as their “upset and anger.” Writing to her in her capacity as head of state and commander-in-chief of the army, navy and air force, an open letter from former members of each of the services said that it was “untenable” for the Duke of York to retain his position.  “Were this any other senior military officer it is inconceivable that he would still be in post,” they say in a letter sent on the day after a Manhattan judge rejected Prince Andrew’s efforts to dismiss Virginia Giuffre’s sexual assault lawsuit against him. The duke denies the allegations against him. Buckingham Palace, where a spokesperson said that it had no comment on the letter, has said previously that the duke’s military appointments are in abeyance after he stepped down from public duties in 2019. But he still retains the roles, leaving eight British regiments, including the Grenadier Guards, where he has held the title of colonel, in limbo more than two years on. His other British honorary military titles are: honorary air commodore of RAF Lossiemouth; colonel-in-chief of the Royal Irish Regiment; colonel-in-chief of the Small Arms School Corps; commodore-in-chief of the Fleet Air Arm; royal colonel of the Royal Highland Fusiliers; deputy colonel-in-chief of the Royal Lancers (Queen Elizabeths’ Own) and royal colonel of the Royal Regiment of Scotland. The veterans add in their letter, which was partly coordinated by the campaign group Republic: “Officers of the British armed forces must adhere to the very highest standards of probity, honesty and honourable conduct. “These are standards which Prince Andrew has fallen well short of. It is hard not to see, when senior officers are reportedly describing him as ‘toxic’, that he has brought the services he is associated with into disrepute. “We are therefore asking that you take immediate steps to strip Prince Andrew of all his military ranks and titles and, if necessary, that he be dishonourably discharged.” The letter concludes with a pointed and personal request to the Queen, who has long been reported to regard Andrew as her “favourite” son. It states: “We understand that he is your son, but we write to you in your capacity as head of state and as commander-in-chief of the army, navy and air force. These steps could have been taken at any time in the past 11 years. Please do not leave it any longer.” Judge Lewis Kaplan’s Wednesday ruling means that Prince Andrew will remain embroiled in lengthy – and embarrassing – legal proceedings for the foreseeable future.",News/UK news,Veterans ask Queen to strip Prince Andrew of honorary military titles,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/13/veterans-ask-queen-to-strip-prince-andrew-of-honorary-military-titles
1/14/2022,"We’ve all got our teas?” checks Daniel Hay-Gordon, looking around the circle of people sitting in a rehearsal space in Brixton, south London. Mugs clutched, things can start, and the discussion is about the early 20th-century poet Edith Sitwell. Hay-Gordon and fellow dancer-choreographer Eleanor Perry set about describing Sitwell to the gathered group: her unhappy childhood, her distinctive appearance, “wonderful slightly hooked nose and big, hooded, very beautiful eyes”, says Perry. Sitwell had Marfan syndrome, a genetic disorder that caused her to have unusually long limbs and fingers, Perry explains. “She felt her hands were as expressive as her face.” This chat is not just cultural history, it is preparation for a performance. In a few weeks’ time, the dancers in the circle will be embodying the poet, transforming on stage into eight Edith Sitwells, complete with headdresses, rings, robes and mannerisms. Sitwell, Perry tells the group, overcame her challenges, and other people’s judgments of her, “by being extremely singular and very proud of who she was”, and that strikes a chord with the assembled dancers, who all come from Corali, a company of performers with learning disabilities. They know what it’s like to subvert expectations and be unashamed of their own difference.  “I do relate to that,” says Corali’s Jackie Ryan, a quietly spoken woman who will be playing one of the piece’s imagined versions of Sitwell and who turns out to be a confident communicator with a talent for one-liners. “I like performing to show people what I can do. My personality comes out on stage,” she says. “I like to see how the audience reacts.” Corali has been running for more than 30 years. Originally founded by a social services worker in Southwark, south London, it has become a pioneering organisation for artists with learning disabilities. They perform and run workshops in hospitals, schools and community centres, but have also collaborated with the Tate galleries and Sadler’s Wells theatre. The partnership with Hay-Gordon and Perry might seem an unlikely one. Known on stage as Thick & Tight, the idiosyncratic duo came through the dance conservatoire system but now make surreal work that sits between cabaret, dance and lip-sync, delving into queer history. Thick & Tight reanimate characters from the past, whether it’s Barbara Cartland, Marlene Dietrich, Diana, Princess of Wales or Marilyn Monroe, in vignettes that traverse high camp and deep pathos. The two companies seem to occupy different spheres, but the way Hay-Gordon sees it, both are on the fringes, championing outsiders. And working together has enriched everyone’s creative life. “They are all amazing performers,” says Perry of Corali, “and they’re so supportive of each other and welcoming to us that it’s just a total joy every time to come back and think of new ways we can work together and what they can bring.” “We gel so well,” says Housni “DJ” Hassan, another of the show’s Sitwells, who brings an infectious buzz to the room. He is constantly moving. When Hay-Gordon describes Sitwell’s expressive hands, Hassan’s fingers immediately start to twirl. He talks about the alchemy between the two companies: “The formula comes together and … Bam! Look what has happened, incredible energy!” Thick & Tight previously made a piece with Corali about the last years of Derek Jarman’s life, set to the music of Stockhausen. “It was to challenge some preconceptions about the sort of work that we could do and the music that we could use,” says Hay-Gordon. Corali’s longtime artistic director is Sarah Archdeacon, who loves how confident her performers are. “Teaming up with Thick & Tight, the audiences are surprised by what they see, but in a really positive way. We can be confident in the difference that we’re celebrating, and we have strength in doing that alongside each other.” As well as the pleasure and pride of performing, Corali’s work offers its members chances to forge relationships they might not otherwise make. “It’s a good opportunity [to work] with people who haven’t got disabilities,” says Ryan. “To trust and help one another as a team. Because you don’t [often] get a chance to work with other people.” To that end, Perry and Hay-Gordon have also invited friends from their network to work with Corali. “There’s a glass ceiling above a lot of artists, and what we can do is shatter that a bit,” says Hay-Gordon. “I think that’s where dance is going; big companies are going to have to start employing artists with disabilities. It’s too separate [now] and it doesn’t work.” Corali stands out as a company that doesn’t put any limits on the kinds of performances it can make, and also for the commitment of the dancers, most of whom have been performing together for nearly 20 years. The secret, Hassan says, is that: “We’re unique, we’re powerful, we understand each other. We know how to do things properly in a fun, creative way, and we’re never negative,” he says. For Hassan, dance is second nature. “I love to transform the way I move,” he says. “It opens up my vocabulary, it transforms my body, I just love moving in a completely different way to what I normally do.” People with disabilities who come to see Corali perform are inspired by seeing people like themselves on stage, notes Ryan. “Some people do get surprised because they don’t know what to expect.” she says. “If someone in the audience is shy or nervous, I make them laugh so they feel comfortable.” Sitwell was the subject of Thick & Tight’s first piece a decade ago (she had tea with Schubert), and they thought she was the perfect subject to revisit with Corali. “Everyone here can do such amazing comedy work,” says Hay-Gordon, “but can also be incredibly touching and make audiences cry. There’s something about that balance … everyone’s going to show a different Edith Sitwell in this work.” “I can’t wait,” says Hassan. “I want to get to know her. I like going back through time, and there are people out there who’ve got so many stories to tell, just like us, and we want to understand where they’re coming from.” The Sitwell piece will be one of nine in Thick & Tight’s new show. Others include encounters with Sid Vicious, Rasputin, Twiggy, and – that famous avant-garde duo – John Cage and Elaine Paige. Their performances are reliably outre – in an early piece, Hitler and Cath Kidston tyrannised the world with their imagined ideals – but Thick & Tight don’t tone down their ideas for their Corali collaborations. “Absolutely not,” says Hay-Gordon, who is frequently found in drag. “If anything, it challenges us to make something even more interesting and explain it properly.” Being honest about who they are means everyone becomes more open-minded. “You see Danny doing these performances, wearing women’s shoes, and there’s nothing wrong with that,” says Ryan. “Give people respect.” She leans over to Hay-Gordon: “Well, you have got a nice pair of legs,” and the room erupts with laughter. Perry says that, through working with Corali, they’ve been learning about social models of disability, the way external factors prevent people from doing things, rather than their own abilities. “There can be an assumption that we want to not be disabled,” says Archdeacon, “that we want to be the same as other people.” But that’s not the case. Corali are not trying to ape non-disabled dancers, they’re bringing their unique selves to the stage. “We’re doing something that’s about difference, and, as Danny said, the dance world is waking up to how brilliant that difference can be.” “We are blessed for who we actually are,” says Hassan. “The experience, the knowledge, the importance, the value. What everyone has been saying here, we’re even more.” Thick & Tight: Short & Sweet is at the Barbican Centre: The Pit, London, 25 to 29 January.",Arts/Stage,‘Bam!

1/14/2022,"The Tories woke this morning to survey the wreckage in their own press, where they find the state of their party and its leader as trashed as No 10’s garden was reported to be after that 20 May bash. The few stalwarts praising the prime minister’s non-remorse today will be of small comfort to him, given their ranks include Ann Widdecombe and Patrick O’Flynn of the Express, while another of their ilk, the Telegraph’s Allison Pearson, has jumped ship altogether. “Never again will these idiots take us for fools,” she writes.  However passionately some editors have backed Boris Johnson as their Brexit champion, even they realise that whatever outrageous untruths they have sold their readers in the past, there is a limit to how far they dare take them for fools. They know their readers balk at Johnson expecting us to believe he thought a party with booze, crisps and sausage rolls was a work event. The rage and pain of bereaved families gets full throttle across their pages because editors know that’s how their readers feel: each one of them remembers the emotional deprivations of their own lockdown. Editors dare not say it’s absurd that a 25-minute appearance at a boring office party should bring down a prime minister: they know this is personal to all of us. They don’t yet call for his head on a platter, but warn that’s where his blond mop will be if he doesn’t do whatever list of things they want: get a grip, cut tax, use Brexit to deregulate everything, abolish all Covid rules and so on. Like the party’s MPs, the Tory press weighs up the pros and cons of keeping Johnson, but the mood is tipping perilously against him. The jaw-dropping duplicity of the rightwing press matches the Tory MPs in their comically sudden discovery that Johnson is a rule-breaking sociopath. Who knew? Here’s the Mail with great acres of space given over to his “litany of lies” over all the years of his life, reprising his every (well-known) public and private disgrace. Well, wow! Watch the scramble as everyone tries to dissociate themselves from everything they always knew in the mealy-mouthed and long-delayed tweets of half-hearted support from his ministers. But Johnson was never the problem. He was only the symptom of what had become of the Conservative world that selected and boosted him. This is what the political poison of Brexit did to them, as the old party morphed into Ukip. A Tory Rip Van Winkle waking from decades of sleep to look round that cabinet table now would be aghast. An extraordinary, pinch-yourself moment came last night on Newsnight with the bizarre spectacle of Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the house (Rip would be agape), telling Kirsty Wark that the leader of the Scottish Tories, Douglas Ross, was only “a lightweight figure”. Ross calling for Johnson to resign is backed by the great majority of his Tory MSPs, facing May’s elections with the Westminster cabinet anathema north of the border. Since the Ukip take-over, the Conservatives stopped being the unionist party, cavalierly throwing the Scots and the Northern Irish under the wheels of their Brexit bus. This is save-our-skins time for each Tory MP facing local Labour and Liberal Democrat leaflets listing which sins they have voted for. Rees-Mogg may reckon no one but Johnson would give him a job. Rishi Sunak vanishing into deepest Devon, cancelling local press interviews yesterday, ranks with Johnson’s attempt to escape journalists by hiding in a fridge during the last election campaign. It may show Sunak’s political greenness that his disloyalty marked him down, splashed over a Tory press inclined to prefer Liz Truss. The Mail gives her a lovely story of her own today: “Liz: Let’s unleash the true potential of Brexit.” How little this ship of fools has learned from their last disastrous leadership selections. Brexit still boils their blood, though it no longer ranks as highly among voters, who are now more concerned with the pandemic and the economy. Johnson’s further plunges in ratings and a 10-point lead for Labour may concentrate their minds; Sunak’s polling has plummeted below zero, too – with his April cost-of-living crunch still to come. The Teflon is permanently scratched off the prime minister, leaving a pan where everything now sticks. Labour hopes he stays in the job for the next election, as Wes Streeting told Newsnight. He described Johnson as “unfit to govern” and called for his resignation, despite saying it was in Labour’s political interests for him to stay. Indeed, a damaged, untrusted and now ridiculed opponent could in theory be a better prospect than the Tory party yet again remodelling itself with a new leader. But a fresh start isn’t in them. Tory MPs and members are destined by their Ukip DNA to select one of their own kind. They are no wiser than they were when they made the disgracefully unpatriotic decision to foist a lying, cheating, self-obsessed scoundrel on the country, knowing his every fault and his full unfitness for office. They are most to blame.
