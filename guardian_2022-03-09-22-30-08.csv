3/9/2022,"A 33-year-old submarine engineer is set to become landlord of a pub with a unique perk: he will pull pints and be king of a tiny, idyllic island which was once the launchpad for an invasion of England. Piel Island is half a mile off the Furness peninsula in Cumbria. It has a castle, a few cottages and a pub, the Ship Inn, for which the local council has been seeking a new custodian. Aaron Sanderson, from Barrow, has been named as the council’s preferred candidate after a recruitment process which saw more than 190 people registering an interest. More than 30 people ultimately submitted an application. The job comes with downsides and upsides. The negatives might be the isolation and running a pub with no mains gas or electricity on an island where there can be more seals than people. Part of the brief is managing and maintaining the whole island. The upsides are the history, the nature and the large numbers of locals and tourists who flock to the island when the weather is good, either by ferry or guided walk over the sands. Plus the landlord is known as the king or queen of Piel Island with a coronation that sees them sitting on their throne while beer is poured over their head. The pub is a challenging place to run and was closed for 21 months before reopening under a temporary arrangement last summer. Sanderson, who works as an electrical team leader at BAE Systems, said many people had been sad to see the pub closed. “I’m looking forward to getting it back up and running and serving visitors … that’s how it should be. “I have very happy memories of visiting Piel as a child and throughout my life. The prospect of me applying for the role was mentioned and from that point I couldn’t get it out of my head. “Personally, it represents both an incredible risk and a wonderful opportunity. I am in a secure and well paid role, but I am willing to give that up for the chance to bring the glory days back to The Ship Inn.” Piel Island is a place steeped in fascinating history, most famous for being the launchpad of an invasion of England which, in 1487, saw the arrival of a ragtag army of 8,000 soldiers consisting of English dissidents, poorly equipped Irish fighters and tough German mercenaries. They were supporting 10-year-old Lambert Simnel who, it was claimed by his Yorkist supporters, was the rightful king of England. They said he was Edward, Earl of Warwick, son of Edward IV’s brother the Duke of Clarence. In truth the young pretender was the son of an Oxford craftsman. The army was soon on its way from Piel towards ignominious defeat by Henry VII’s much stronger army at Stoke Field near Newark, considered the final battle of the War of the Roses. Simnel was a king of Piel and one story says that the landlords running the pub are his direct descendants. The tradition sees the landlord being crowned king in a ceremony involving a rusty sabre and buckets of beer. Any punter who unwittingly sits on the throne has to buy drinks for everyone. Sanderson said he planned to move to the island with his partner Anita Palfi. A precise date for the reopening has yet to be announced. Ann Thomson, the leader of Barrow borough council, said: “This was a very competitive process and we are delighted to be moving to the next stage with our preferred bidder.",News/UK news,Submarine engineer from Cumbria to become Piel Island ‘king’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/09/submarine-engineer-from-cumbria-to-become-piel-island-king
3/9/2022,"The Order of Friendship of the Russian Federation is a star-shaped golden medal, encrusted with blue enamel, showing a map of the world. Last year, as Russia was beginning to ration supplies of gas to Europe and Vladimir Putin was planning his assault on Ukraine, Roger Munnings announced he had been named as the medal’s latest recipient. The former long-serving head of KPMG’s Russian operations, Munnings is a director of three firms of major strategic importance Putin’s regime: Lukoil, Nornickel and the banking to telecoms conglomerate Sistema. Munnings is a busy man. As well as his three directorships – which pay out an estimated $707,000 a year combined, according to company filings – he also heads the Russo-British Chamber of Commerce, which promotes closer ties between the two countries. Now, these ties are fast unravelling as western governments tighten sanctions on Moscow and businesses cut all dealings with Russia. Scores of directors have relinquished roles in the 35 Russian firms suspended from the London Stock Exchange last week, and there have been departures from a clutch of other Russian controlled companies with their main listings in the UK capital. The exodus began after the Institute of Directors urged Britons to uphold their “moral duty”, with the clarion call: leave now. While many have heeded the call, Munnings, who lived in Russia for more than a decade, is staying put. He did not respond to requests to comment on his decision. Outrage over the war in Ukraine has forced a moral dilemma on companies and left time-honoured governance mechanisms in shreds. Several boards face the potential problem of not having sufficient numbers left to make decisions in the proper way. The momentum driving the departures heightened when the Conservative peer and former UK energy minister Greg Barker on Monday quit as the executive chair of EN+, the metals group part-owned by the sanctioned Russian Oleg Deripaska, after intense political pressure. Joan MacNaughton, an influential climate change figure who joined EN+ in 2019, had already stepped down from the board on Friday. The gold and silver producer Polymetal announced on Monday the resignations of six directors, including the British chair and mining veteran Ian Cockerill. He received an annual fee of $544,000 in 2021 – up from $483,000 the year before, the 2021 company report shows. Four directors left the board of Russian supermarket chain Lenta, after the billionaire Alexei Mordashov, who has a majority stake in the London-listed company, was put on the EU sanctions list last week. Headed by Vladimir Kiriyenko, who was sanctioned by the US for his links to the Kremlin, the social media site VK Group was hit by six of its directors resigning in only three days. They include VK’s managing director and chief financial officer, Matthew Hammond. On Friday, James Rutherford stepped down as a non-executive director of the Roman Abramovich-backed Russian steelmaker Evraz, which dropped out of the FTSE 100 last week after investors sold out in droves and the share price plunged by 68% following the invasion of Ukraine. Evraz, which announced a dividend worth $450m to Abramovich, has so far not been hit by the sanctions targeting firms with strong links to Russia and it retains a number of British directors. Other British directors, including one with connections to the royal family, remain at Evraz. Sir Michael Peat, the accountant and former private secretary to the Prince of Wales, retains his seat, for which he earned $214,000 last year, according to the annual report. So does the ex-Ford Motor Company executive Stephen Odell ($138,000), and the former Deloitte director Deborah Gudgeon ($322,000). They did not respond to a request for comment. The moral turmoil is also hitting companies that are not focused on Russia. Uladzimir Boltach, a British national originally from Belarus, last week left his 14-year post as operations director of a Belarusian autorecycling firm with an office in Lancashire because of Belarus’s indirect involvement in the war. “It was one of the hardest decisions I’ve ever made. I helped organise aid to Ukraine and thought it was my moral obligation to change the course of my career. “I still remember my grandmother who was shot in the leg during the second world war telling me stories about Germany invading Belarus. Nobody in Belarus wants this to come back again and it is heartbreaking to see what 10 days of war has done to Ukraine and its people.” Carl Hughes, who specialised in the energy industry during his career at Deloitte and remains as an EN+ board member and chair of the audit committee, has taken a very different stance to Boltach, putting up a strong defence of his decision to stay in his $264,000-a-year post. Hughes said: “25,000 employees of EN+ are located outside of Russia, including 4,000 employees at the group’s alumina refinery in Ukraine. Providing practical financial support to our Ukrainian workforce has been a key focus over the past fortnight. “My current focus is on my fiduciary duty to the group and its shareholders, and also to its employees and customers, all of which extend well beyond Russia.” Xavier Rolet, ex-chief of the LSE, is another Russia remainer. He still sits on the board of the fertiliser firm PhosAgro as an independent director. The mining firm Severstal still features two Britons on its board, Christopher Clark and Martin Angle, despite the resignation of other directors Philip Dayer and Alun Bowen, following the EU sanction on Mordashov, Severstal’s chairman. Robert Edwards is holding fast on the board of Nornickel, the world’s largest nickel producer, which counts the Russian billionaire Vladimir Potanin as its controlling shareholder. At Polyus, Russia’s biggest gold producer controlled by the US-sanctioned executive Suleiman Kerimov, there remain two British directors on the board: Alexandra Maria Beckwith, and Tony Antoniou, who also works for MTS, Russia’s largest mobile network provider that is majority-owned by Sistema. They were approached for comment. The Queen’s cousin Prince Michael of Kent is for now still listed as a patron of the Russo-British Chamber of Commerce, although this week his spokesperson confirmed he had handed back his Order of Friendship medal to the Kremlin. All eyes are now on Munnings, who has much more than a medal to loose from this conflict.",News/World news,The moral dilemma facing Britons on Russian boards,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/the-moral-dilemma-facing-britons-on-russian-boards-ukraine
3/9/2022,"A man has died after falling about 300 metres (1,000ft) down Ben Nevis, and 17 others had to be rescued in “ferocious” conditions during an eight-hour operation on Britain’s highest mountain. After a 28-year-old man fell down an icy slope at Red Burn, on the west side of the mountain, members of an army group went to his aid but ended up requiring multiple rescues themselves. Seventeen people, including about a dozen military personnel, either were airlifted off the 1,345-metre-tall (4,413ft) mountain by coastguard search and rescue helicopters from Prestwick and Inverness or were walked off the hill by some of the almost 40 rescuers who went to their aid. Members of Lochaber and Glencoe mountain rescue teams and a police mountain rescue team were sent to Ben Nevis after the alarm was raised at about 2.15pm on Tuesday. Donald Paterson, the deputy team leader of the Lochaber team, said the conditions on the mountain were “classic Alpine – springlike in the glen but above the snow line everything is solid and an ice axe and crampons are essential, and knowing how to use them”. He said: “This chap had fallen conservatively about 300 metres. Then others went to help him and they, too, ended up in trouble. One had a broken ankle and another multiple abrasions. As the night wore on, the conditions got worse. “Members of the party could have been better prepared for the conditions. We would like to express our condolences to the deceased’s family and friends.” Brian Bathurst, the deputy team leader of Glencoe mountain rescue team, said the conditions were “ferocious”. “The snow fields are glazed over with ice and are quite lethal. One slip and you will go a long way,” he said. “The conditions last night were very difficult. As well as the ice there were very strong winds and rain. The helicopters did an amazing job.” The military group were believed to be from the Edinburgh area. It is not clear whether the individual who died was a member of their party. It was the third death in the Highlands in a week, and hopes are fading for a missing hill walker. Lochaber mountain rescue team said the past five days had been “especially busy”, with 12 callouts and 26 casualties recovered. “Unfortunately three of these shouts resulted in fatalities and we’d like to extend our heartfelt condolence to the friends and family of those involved at this difficult time.” It added: “It would be remiss if we didn’t stress just how important it is to be adequately prepared for winter in the hills. Having the ability to competently navigate with map and compass as well as having and being able to use crampons and axe are vital skills to have if you’re venturing into the hills.”",News/UK news,Man dies and 17 rescued in ‘ferocious’ conditions on Ben Nevis,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/09/man-dies-17-rescued-ferocious-conditions-ben-nevis-scotland
3/9/2022,"Gatwick is expecting 3 million passengers a month this summer as the easing of travel restrictions and the return of takeoff and landing slot rules help the airport recover from its pandemic slump. The airport reported narrower losses of just over £1m a day in 2021, down £95m on 2020 to £371m, despite passenger numbers falling further to 6.3 million last year. Gatwick is expecting more than 30 million passengers in 2022, operating at 85% capacity in the summer, aided by the return of slot rules that ensure airlines use their alloted takeoff and landing slots at least 70% of the time. The south terminal, mothballed to save money, will reopen at the end of March, when British Airways will also return to short-haul flying from the airport. Gatwick’s biggest airline customer, EastJet, is planning to expand to record levels with 120 routes this summer, partly using slots leased from BA. Gatwick said the decision to restore airport slot regulations, put on ice in 2020, would “restore discipline” and be more efficient and economically beneficial for the region, but denied it would lead to any “ghost flights”. Chief executive, Stewart Wingate, said load factors on flights were already high, before the new rules come into effect, adding: “My biggest worry has been having a ghost terminal.” He said the end of travel restrictions had increased demand and businesses at the airport had been recruiting for more than 2,000 new posts over recent months. Wingate said the airport was “very alert” to the risks from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but said that at present, “in terms of our business, presuming that the conflict doesn’t escalate, there is a very small direct exposure. On oil prices, the majority of large airlines are well hedged”. The airport completed a public consultation into developing its standby runway for routine use at the end of 2021, the next step on a path that it hopes will lead to the government approving its capacity expansion in 2024. Wingate said the airport hoped to exceed pre-pandemic business levels in 2025. He added: “Fully restoring consumer confidence will take time and I urge government to make 2022 the year when all travel restrictions are removed completely, including the unpopular passenger locator form.”",News/World news,Gatwick forecasts 3m monthly passengers this summer as losses narrow,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/gatwick-forecasts-3m-monthly-passengers-this-summer-as-losses-narrow
3/9/2022,"The impact of the cost of living crisis on children in the UK already living in poverty would in some cases prove “fatal”, the food writer and campaigner Jack Monroe told MPs, adding: “And that’s not a term that I use lightly.” Children and disabled people experiencing food insecurity risked being trapped in a “never-ending loop of difficulty”, including chronic health conditions, mental illness and depression, Monroe told the Commons work and pensions select committee. Monroe described the situation faced by millions of children living in poverty as “already untenable”, having become increasingly so over the last decade, and called for social security benefits to be uprated in line with inflation. Individuals on the lowest incomes had been hit hardest by increases in the price of everyday food essentials, and the reduced availability of value product lines, she told MPs. A £20 food shop now bought about two-thirds the amount of goods it did a few years ago. “And that’s not people deciding not to go to the theatre or not have legs of lamb or bottles of champagne; that is people deciding ‘we won’t eat on Tuesday or Thursday this week’ or ‘we’ll turn the heating off’ or ‘we’ll skip meals’,” she said. Last month Monroe successfully campaigned for Asda, her local supermarket in Shoeburyness, Essex, to reintroduce value food lines, and drop prices on a number of basic products such as rice and pasta, which had in some cases gone up by more than 100% in a year. Asda reintroduced the items and prices in all its UK stores and online. Asked by the committee chair, Stephen Timms, why she thought supermarkets had withdrawn their value range, Monroe said: “They thought they could get away with it. They did it for a very long time. They probably thought no one would notice, and the people who did notice weren’t the people who tended to be listened to.” She added: “I’m grateful they have listened but exasperated that it took a late-night rant on Twitter in order for anybody to pay any attention.” It was wrong that food retailers in effect were deciding whether customers could access sufficient food, she suggested “The onus on ensuring that people are able to feed themselves adequately and decently and nutritiously should not fall on the price point of pasta in a supermarket.” Monroe urged the government to increase social security benefits by at least 6% from April, rather than the planned 3.1% rise. “Even 6% is not going to adequately cover the difference in cost of living, plugging the gap for what people haven’t had for so long, but it’s a start.” She disputed the notion that it would be difficult for the government to come up with an adequate level of benefits. “It’s simply a matter of giving people the dignity and the advocacy to say ‘this is what I need’ and give it to them. No one is asking for the moon. People just want to be able to pay their rent and feed their kids.”Monroe said people on low incomes were cutting down on food to cope with the soaring costs of rent and energy. “In my experience of 10 years on the coalface of anti-poverty work, I can tell you that people are just eating less or skipping meals or having less nutritious food, bulking out on that 45p white rice and 29p pasta in lieu of being able to have fresh fruit and vegetables and nutritionally balanced meals. “It’s not that food has got cheaper because it certainly hasn’t. It’s that everything else has got more expensive so there is less in the household budget for food.”",News/Business,"Cost of living crisis could be fatal for some UK children, Jack Monroe tells MPs",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/09/cost-of-living-crisis-fatal-some-uk-children-jack-monroe-food-writer-tells-mps
3/9/2022,"More than a quarter of Britons believe that Covid-19 was likely to have been a biological weapon intentionally spread by the Chinese state, according to new polling highlighting the spread of conspiracy theories. The findings are contained in a major report by the campaign group Hope Not Hate (HNH) warning that the rise of Covid conspiracy theories and the anti-lockdown movement are fuelling the recruitment of young people to far-right ideas and movements. It also says the economic hardship of the past year and worries about the future have created an environment in which far-right activists may return to the streets. The same polling – commissioned to form part of the annual State of Hate report – highlighted that faith in democracy and the political establishment is extremely low. A total of 1,492 people were surveyed by Focaldata on 25-26 February, though it remains to be seen whether Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may have an impact on support for democratic values. More than half of people (57%) were not satisfied with the way democracy is working in the UK, while 58% believed that getting involved in politics was “a waste of time because nothing changes”. In terms of how conspiracy theories had infiltrated the mainstream, the polling found 6% thought it was definitely true that “coronavirus is a bio-weapon intentionally spread by the Chinese state”, with a further 23% thinking it was probably true. The findings echo those about the reach of the same conspiracy theories in other states, though levels of belief were even higher in countries such as the US. Nick Lowles, the CEO of Hope Not Hate, said: “After years in the political wilderness, the crises we’ve collectively faced over the past two years have emboldened cynical far-right activists to exploit our fears and uncertainties and return to traditional methods of campaigning.” “In 2021, we saw far-right activists marching on our streets, leafleting, and now they are preparing to stand in local elections.” While the country had “moved on” from Brexit, which had marginalised the British far right, he said there had been a loss of confidence in political leaders amid vaccine hesitancy, growing opposition towards lockdowns, the Partygate scandal and a looming cost of living crisis. “This has all created fertile ground for far-right activists to exploit people’s fears and twist narratives to suit its hateful ideology,” he added. Other polling by Focaldata for HNH – surveying 1,082 people of black and minority ethnic heritage carried out between the 17 December and 4 January 2022 – found that racism remained an everyday experience for many people of colour. More than half of respondents had witnessed (24%) or experienced (28%) racial abuse in the last year. Two-thirds of people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds believe black and Asian people face discrimination in their everyday lives. Hope Not Hate, which campaigns against racism and fascism and has also mounted campaigns against Islamist extremism and antisemitism, says in the report it is particularly worried about the growing numbers of young people being attracted to far-right politics and dangerous conspiracy theories. New trends which it highlighted included moves by the far right to recruit via online fitness groups, whose popularity soared during the pandemic. As far-right activists began to emerge on to the streets again conducting leafleting campaigns, the report also recorded that during 2021 there were 125 protests outside hotels, hostels and other accommodation centres housing refugees and asylum seekers. But it also said that, as “deplatforming” of far-right activists on more mainstream social media platforms had increased, many had moved across to alternative social media spaces where they are out of reach of regulators. Stephen Yaxley-Lennon – who calls himself Tommy Robinson – remained the best known far-right figure in the UK, with 57% of the British public having heard of him, according to HNH’s research. He was singled out as having the biggest reach, with more than 180,000 followers on the alternative platform GETTR, 155,000 followers on Telegram and 28,000 subscribers on the video-sharing platform BitChute.",News/World news,"29% of Britons think China likely to have spread Covid on purpose, poll says",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/29-of-britons-think-china-likely-to-have-spread-covid-on-purpose-poll-says
3/9/2022,"For a while, this NFL’s offseason’s quarterback carousel barely moved. Tom Brady retired. So did Ben Roethlisberger. And despite a much-analyzed Instagram post from Aaron Rodgers that could have doubled as a retirement statement, the back-to-back MVP is staying put in Green Bay. This came after weeks of speculation that Rodgers might be headed to the very quarterback-needy Denver Broncos. Much to the dismay of Broncos fans and players, Rodgers took the sensible route on Tuesday and stayed in the city where he’s had nothing but success. And his favorite teammate is sticking around too. So all appeared to be pleasantly boring on the quarterback front until shortly after Rodgers confirmed he was staying in Wisconsin. And then Seattle dropped a BOOM louder than any produced by their storied defenses of the mid-2010s. The Seahawks traded Russell Wilson and a fourth-round pick to the Broncos for two first-round picks, two second-round picks, a fifth-round pick, plus quarterback Drew Lock, tight end Noah Fant, and defensive lineman Shelby Harris. That, folks, is what we call a blockbuster. There is much to dissect about the trade. Will Wilson follow in the footsteps of Peyton Manning and Brady and win a Super Bowl ring with a second franchise? Who will be Seattle’s starting quarterback? Because surely it can’t be Lock, even for one season. Will they use their newly acquired ninth overall selection on a quarterback or trade away draft picks for the rights to Deshaun Watson? Watson is clearly the biggest quarterback talent pining for a new team, but he’s also mired in serious legal troubles. Grading a trade of this magnitude is a fun exercise but, in this case, highly irrelevant given the number of draft picks involved. Just because Seattle have a recent history of mostly whiffing in the draft (see: first-rounders LJ Collier, Rashaad Penny, and Germain Ifedi), doesn’t mean that trend will continue. In truth, we may not know this trade’s “winner” for years. What we do know is with Wilson’s migration to Denver, the AFC West has instantly become the NFL’s splashiest division. Franchise quarterbacks are gold and Wilson joins Patrick Mahomes, Derek Carr, and Justin Herbert for a foursome that would be hard to refute as the best divisional group in NFL history. There have been divisions stacked with star quarterbacks before – for example, the 1993 AFC East featured Jim Kelly (Buffalo), Boomer Esiason (New York), Drew Bledsoe (New England), and Dan Marino (Miami) – but not one where everyone was a star quarterbacks. (Jeff George, Indianapolis’s starting quarterback, was also in the AFC East that year.) In Wilson, Mahomes, Carr, and Herbert, the division has quarterbacks that have won MVPs and Super Bowls, been in the MVP conversation, or are expected to be soon enough. The quartet has three of the top-five passing yard leaders from last season: Mahomes, Carr and Herbert combined for a whopping 14,657 passing yards in 2021. Add in Wilson, who has never had a playbook designed to let him air it out for an entire season yet has made his mark as one of the greatest magicians the NFL has ever seen. Except for Herbert, who is just getting started, these are all quarterbacks in their prime. If the NFL doesn’t douse its 2022 primetime slate with AFC West games, the league needs new schedule makers. How Wilson adapts to the Broncos, and how they react to having their first bonafide franchise quarter since Manning retired in 2015 will be fascinating enough. But Seattle without Wilson is an unfathomable reality to grasp. Wilson has been synonymous with the city since he was drafted by the Seahawks in the third-round a decade ago. Soon after news of the trade was made public, the Seahawks posted a now deleted tweet of the famous scene from Castaway in which Tom Hanks’s character cries out for his friend, a volleyball named Wilson, as it floats away into the deep blue ocean. Looks like Russell Wilson isn’t the only person who no longer works for the @SeahawksFairly certain they just fired their social media manager too 😂 pic.twitter.com/oYA5GALWI5 It was an awkward clip to post given the rawness of the news. But also because the scene perfectly encapsulates how Wilson’s departure (the quarterback not the volleyball) will affect the city of Seattle. The release of eight-time Pro Bowl linebacker Bobby Wagner hours after the Wilson trade confirmed the obvious. The Seahawks are officially in rebuild mode. Usually, we let the dust settle before determining where a player ranks in the NFL’s pantheon. It’s one reason players are not eligible for the Pro Football Hall of Fame for five seasons once they retire. But when it comes to the Russell Wilson Era in Seattle, the narrative is clear. Few quarterbacks have done more with less. Sure, Seattle were led by the Legion of Boom for a nice chunk of Wilson’s tenure – the Seahawks led the league in scoring defense between 2012-2015. But it was after the “boom” faded that Wilson really made his mark. He kept up his wizardry on a freakishly consistent basis, all with a perennial low-end offensive line. Doug Baldwin and DK Metcalf have been big playmakers for the Seahawks, but Wilson is the reason Seattle had been a playoff mainstay, no matter the roster or challenges. Everything fell on Wilson’s shoulders in recent years. Now he will bring his bag of tricks to Denver. The expectations will be high but the burden will be less considering the Broncos’ solid defense and collection of young playmakers on offense. This new chapter in Wilson’s career will be rooted in comparisons to his AFC West quarterbacking brethren. And rightly so. If all four quarterbacks stay on their current trajectory, the NFL is going to need as much AFC West as possible.",Sport/Sport,"Wilson, Mahomes, Herbert and Carr: is the AFC West the hardest division in NFL history?",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/09/wilson-mahomes-herbert-and-carr-is-the-afc-west-now-the-nfls-group-of-death
3/9/2022,"Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK has told MPs that 100,000 of his citizens could come to Britain to escape the Russian war machine and said he would be “happy” if visa requirements for Ukrainians were lifted. Vadym Prystaiko also said he planned to ask Priti Patel why Ukrainian citizens on work and student visas were not allowed to invite their family members to join them in the UK. In a damning assessment of the UK’s immigration system, he called for a “simplified” process for refugees fleeing to the UK and disclosed that his own wife struggled to get a visa before the Russia conflict. His comments will increase pressure on the government as MPs from all parties and their constituents call for the easing of restrictions to allow Ukrainians into the UK. So far, just 760 UK visas have been granted to Ukrainians fleeing their homeland out of 2 million conflict refugees. In an appearance before the home affairs select committee, Prystaiko said he did not wish to interfere in UK immigration policies, but that lifting barriers could help his country. Asked if he would like visa requirements to be waived altogether, in line with moves in the EU, he said: “I understand how sensitive it is for your society, especially after the immigration crisis, refugee crisis with Syrians, which we believe was manufactured by Russia pushing out these people from Syria, flooding with immigration, wave after wave, to Europe. “That would definitely resolve all the issues, but how reasonable, how justified it is with your own system, that’s frankly for you to decide. We will be happy if all the barriers are dropped for some period of time when we can get maximum [numbers] of people, then we will deal with that.” In an appearance in the Grimond Room in Portcullis House, he said there were usually about 50,000 to 60,000 Ukrainians in Britain. “I guess that people will unite with their families, and if you have 50-60,000 of them, I would expect 100,000 – at least – to come here to their relatives, some of them just members of families of your citizens who have no Ukrainian blood but for different reasons they have connections … which we are not aware of,” he told MPs. At present, those on temporary work visas or student visas are not entitled to invite their relatives to join them. The SNP’s home affairs spokesperson, Stuart McDonald, asked if the Ukrainian government would like the rules extended. Prystaiko expressed surprise at the current rules and said he would raise this with the home secretary. “I didn’t know, that’s a good point, thank you very much. I thought that this covered [the] principle that everyone who is legally here can use the system. Thank you for clearing … I will talk to secretary Patel about this because I would expect this would be the natural way,” he said. Prystaiko also called for an easing of the “bureaucratic” processes that were hampering asylum seekers’ attempts to come to the UK. By way of an example, he told MPs how his wife was initially denied a visa when he was appointed Ukraine’s envoy to Britain. “When I was coming here as ambassador, I got my visa on time. Although I was already approved by your government, my wife didn’t have it,” he said. He said Ukrainians did not want to be a burden on the UK system, adding: “Most of these people are well educated and have their own business ideas – most of them are in professions which can be done remotely, like IT.”",News/UK news,Ukrainian ambassador calls on UK to simplify process for refugees,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/09/ukrainian-ambassador-calls-on-uk-to-simplify-process-for-refugees
3/9/2022,"A new study has found that neighborhoods in which the federal government discouraged investment nearly 100 years ago – via a racist practice known as redlining – face higher levels of air pollution today. Looking at more than 200 cities across the nation, researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, found that people who live in neighborhoods that were once categorized as “hazardous”, based on racist factors such as how many Black or “foreign-born” people lived there, now breathe 56% more of the freeway pollutant nitrogen dioxide than those in top-rated areas. Those formerly redlined neighborhoods also suffer from higher levels of the sooty particle known as PM 2.5, the study found. And both pollutants are associated with health effects, including higher rates of asthma, cardiovascular disease and even Covid-19. “The people who made the decision [to redline certain neighborhoods] aren’t even alive any more,” said Joshua Apte, a UC Berkeley environmental engineering professor, who co-authored the study, published in Environmental Science and Technology Letters on Wednesday. “But the decisions made a long time ago still matter quite a lot for the disparities experienced today.” In the 1930s, the federal government created a series of maps that indicated where Black people, immigrants, and other groups of the people that they considered “too risky” to have as neighbors lived, and used those maps to discourage mortgage lending in those neighborhoods. This process was known as redlining, because the makers of those maps shaded those areas in red. The Berkeley research illustrates how those discriminatory maps, created by the federal Home Owners’ Loan Corporation between 1935 and 1940, shaped urban development and real estate practices for nearly a century afterwards. It concludes that the maps helped to shape present-day locations of roads, freeways, industrial facilities, ports, and other major sources of pollution, thus influencing which neighborhoods have clean air today. “Our findings illustrate how redlining, a nearly 80-year-old racially discriminatory policy, continues to shape systemic environmental exposure disparities in the United States,” wrote the study’s lead author, Haley Lane, a researcher in civil and environmental engineering at UC Berkeley. The authors acknowledged the federal mortgage maps were not the first or the only instance of racist policy that determined long-lasting patterns of settlement and development in the US, but they said the maps provided a lens for studying how the racism of earlier generations still dictates winners and losers today. The study compared the estimated 2010 pollution levels for each census block to historical redlining maps digitized by the Mapping Inequalities Project of the University of Richmond. The racist logic for shading each area of the map can be seen by clicking on individual neighborhoods in the maps, which cite supporting documents compiled by the federal loan agency. Neighborhoods that received the highest grade, “A”, were shaded green on the maps and deemed minimal risks for banks and other mortgage lenders. Blue-shaded neighborhoods were deemed “still desirable” and yellow were labeled “definitely declining”. Homes in red-shaded “D” neighborhoods were labelled “hazardous” and were typically ineligible for federally backed loans or favorable mortgage terms. Yvonka Hall, an environmental disparities expert and the executive director of the Northeast Ohio Black Health Coalition, has seen the results of redlining play out in her own Cleveland neighborhood, which was colored red and yellow in the maps. She said the discriminatory investment patterns highlighted in the mapping resulted in highways being constructed right through the center of the neighborhood and polluting industries being allowed to locate all around it, while positive investment was kept out. And she said the area now suffered from all types of pollution. “The African American community faced decades of environmental neglect,” said Hall, who herself has chronic bronchitis and has seen her neighbors struggling with all kinds of long-term illnesses. “What you see is the disparities of redlining persist [over time]. These areas are now more likely to have health issues, lead poisoning, asthma, lung cancer, heart disease, and don’t forget Covid.” Julian Marshall, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of Washington and co-author of the study, said even though the Clean Air Act, passed in 1970, had reduced pollution for nearly all Americans, immediate action was needed to reduce the systemic racial inequalities tied to air pollution. “Environmental inequalities are immediate and local, but they’re also systemic and long term,” he said. “So that means the solutions also need to last longer than one presidential administration. We inherited this problem, but we need to act now to prevent it from continuing in the future.”",News/US news,How US redlining led to an air pollution crisis 100 years later,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/09/redlining-air-pollution-us-cities
3/9/2022,"Russian oligarchs will be able to exploit legal loopholes around Britain’s art market to evade sanctions and launder money, experts have warned, despite Boris Johnson’s claim there will be “nowhere to hide” from a clampdown on Kremlin-linked wealth. It comes as the Labour MP Chris Bryant warned that “valuable assets” are likely to be traded by supporters of Vladimir Putin, and called on Christie’s and Sotheby’s – the leading auction houses – to refuse to handle them. However, experienced advisers said the ultimate “beneficial” owner of priceless art works could still be concealed, aided by the market’s global scale and increasing online presence. Kremlin-linked cash could also be laundered through collectibles such as stamps, wine and the burgeoning market in non-fungible tokens (NFTS), which do not feature in UK money-laundering regulations dating back to 2017. The concerns come amid questions about whether Sotheby’s and Christie’s will keep their offices in Moscow, with calls for a boycott of Phillips, a major auctioneer owned by a Russian luxury goods company. Tremors from the invasion of Ukraine have already rippled through the art market, with Christie’s citing “the current world’s situation” for the postponement of a recent auction of rare Russian avant garde art books, and an ex-CEO of rival auction house Bonhams leading calls for the boycott of Phillips. Phillips, which is owned by Russia’s Mercury group, told the Guardian that “it is business as usual” and that its auctions were going ahead as planned. However, the company has already faced criticism for proceeding last week with a £30m London sale of works by artists including David Hockney, Claude Monet and – a favourite among wealthy Russians – Francis Bacon. While the company announced that it was donating the full net proceeds of the auction to the Ukrainian Red Cross Society – raising £5.8m – it continues to be challenged. Phillips is listed by Companies House as having two owners “with significant control” – Leonid Fridlyand and Leonid Strunin – Russians who give their address as the company’s Mayfair headquarters and their countries of residence as Monaco and Cyprus respectively. Both men have yet to comment, but the company’s CEO, Stephen Brooks, said it unequivocally condemned the invasion of Ukraine and “called for an immediate cessation of all hostilities in the strongest possible terms”. Sotheby’s, Phillips, Christie’s and other companies stress that they comply with all anti-money laundering and “know your client” obligations, carrying out due diligence to ensure individuals and institutions targeted by sanctions are unable to do business through their salesrooms. In response to Bryant’s comments, Sotheby’s said it conducts business in strict compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including global sanctions. It is “absolutely rigorous” about following the present sanctions, and is monitoring closely for any updates to the lists. Its Moscow office is currently closed to the public. Christie’s, which said its Moscow office “currently” remains open, said it had immediately taken action through its client identification and screening processes. It added it was not permitting individuals or companies designated on applicable sanctions lists to transact with it. “Politically exposed persons” were also subject to enhanced due diligence. However, Prof Louise Shelley, director of the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center at George Mason University in the US – warned that the global nature of the market and “gaping holes” in US safeguards rendered London highly vulnerable. “A lot of buyers in the UK market are in the US, a jurisdiction where we are simply not doing enough. You can have someone represent a corporation which can be shielded on numerous fronts and no one will have an idea who is behind it,” she said. She added: “There is clearly a lot of desperate movement of all kinds of commodities and resources through investment vehicles at the moment, but art markets are the ideal way of moving wealth and hiding the beneficial ownership. “We have a gaping hole in our laws here in the US at the moment which ultimately means that it’s possible to buy art in other jurisdictions quite easily. Oligarchs and their nominees would be busy exploiting every gaping hole that they can find.” London-based experts said that larger auction houses had started to put more resources and time into due diligence since the money-laundering regulations introduced in 2017, but smaller companies may struggle . “It has become more difficult to hide the identity of the ultimate beneficial owner, but you can do a number of thing such as structure your affairs so you have nominees here and there. Or you can just lie,” said one. “If someone wants to find a way of hiding the ultimate beneficial owner, then they will always find a way.” At the moment, sanctioned oligarchs and others connected to the Putin regime could be viewing the art market both as a means of monetising art that they are sitting on – albeit taking a hit on the price – or as a way of putting money into a highly mobile investment that can also be physically stored offshore in a discreet way. Brexit, which rendered it more cumbersome to bring art into the UK, means the second scenario is likely to be more attractive. Other experts highlighted more glaring loopholes in the 2017 legislation and shortcomings when it came to its limited definitions of what is art. “Think of collectibles that are not caught by those regulations. If I was inclined to use art to move dirty money, I would be thinking of things like stamps, vehicles and other expensive kit out of that scope,” said one. HMRC has been approached for comment.",News/UK news,"Russia oligarchs still able to exploit UK art market loopholes, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/09/russia-oligarchs-uk-art-market-legal-loopholes
3/9/2022,"It is more than 33 years ago since Neneh Cherry swaggered around the Top of the Pops stage in big white trainers performing Buffalo Stance with the fierce energy of a woman who was having a fine old time and wanted everyone to know about it. Around her neck hung a huge medallion and she wore a golden bustier and matching jacket. But it wasn’t her outfit that was the talking point at secondary school the next day – but the seven-month pregnancy bump that stuck proudly out of her Lycra miniskirt as she lip-synched along. It was the first time many of us had seen a pregnant woman being, well, visible and certainly the only time we’d seen one looking so sensationally cool. Allegedly, a journalist was daft enough to check with Cherry that it was safe for her to go on stage in her state of pregnancy, to which she sighed: “It’s not an illness.” It was footage of the Pakistan captain, Bismah Maroof, holding her six-month-old daughter Fatima at the Women’s World Cup in New Zealand that instantly brought back memories of that Thursday night watching Cherry. Although Maroof was dressed in her pine-green Pakistan tracksuit and had her hair pulled back in a sportswoman’s ponytail, she radiated the same power to inspire change. Seeing female cricketers with their children is not unknown, and there are eight mothers playing in the current World Cup – Maroof, the New Zealand captain, Amy Satterthwaite, and her wife, Lea Tahuhu, West Indies’ Afy Fletcher, Australia’s Megan Schutt and Rachael Haynes, and Lizelle Lee and Masabata Klaas of South Africa – but it is practically unheard of on the subcontinent, where marriage and/or childbirth is usually the end for a cricketing career. A fantastic article by Annesha Ghosh in The Cricket Monthly, looking at motherhood and cricket, summarises that only three of the 81 female cricketers contracted by India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are married. Maroof, then, is an outlier, not only leading her country but showing that motherhood does not have to spell the end to sporting ambition. Maroof tells Ghosh that even during her own career, some of her teammates have had to give up the game: “Batool [Fatima], Nain [Abidi], Asmavia [Iqbal], Qanita [Jalil] and several others – they were all Pakistan teammates of mine who either couldn’t resume cricket for a long time after marriage or had to leave it altogether for good.” However, the increased professionalism of the game over the past few years, and Maroof’s own pregnancy, nudged the Pakistan Cricket Board, during Wasim Khan’s spell as chief executive, into a maternity leave policy. This gives women a year’s paid leave (and men a month) plus shared costs of a support person to help with childcare – in this case Maroof’s mother, who has been seen cuddling Fatima in the stands. The standout photos of Maroof and her baby came after the World Cup game between India and Pakistan on Sunday, won by India (therefore cementing their 100% record against Pakistan in one-day internationals). In them, members of the Indian team surround Maroof who is holding Fatima, cooing over the altogether cuteness of the baby in her red headband, playing peek-a-boo and trying to get her to look at the camera. The sheer delight shared between the two teams is not something that is usually demonstrated between the Pakistan and Indian men’s teams, whose matches in international tournaments are often hijacked by politicians and fans and turned into some kind of ridiculous proxy war, often ending in violence, either in the stands or on the streets. The lower profile of the women’s matches, and the friendship between the players, has led to a far happier conclusion. “Coming back post-pregnancy in six months and playing international cricket is so inspiring,” wrote Smriti Mandhana on Instagram. “Bismah Maroof setting an example for sportswomen across the globe. Lots of love to baby Fatima from India and I hope she picks the bat just like you because lefties are special.” Despite the disparity in achievement between the two teams – India are ranked four and Pakistan eight – it is actually Pakistan who have taken the lead in franchise cricket, with Ramiz Raja, the Pakistan Cricket Board’s player-chairman, announcing a women’s branch of the Pakistan Super League to be played next year. Meanwhile the BCCI continues to stonewall on the possibility of a women’s Indian Premier League, with the secretary, Jay Shah, saying it would happen “soon”, despite the obvious talent pool of female cricketers and a ready supply of foreign players desperate to be part of the story. But, in the hours after International Women’s Day, our thoughts should rest most with cricket-loving girls in Afghanistan, where the future of the women’s cricket team is still unclear, and most teenage girls have now gone 173 days without returning to school after the Taliban took over. In November, the Afghanistan Cricket Board’s chair, Mirwais Ashraf, said: “Women’s cricket is one of the major requirements of the ICC. Therefore it is committed to obtaining it.” However, most of Afghanistan women’s team are believed to have fled the country and on the ACB website there are no photographs of any female players, no details of any upcoming women’s fixtures. In fact, no details on women’s cricket at all.  This is an extract from the Guardian’s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

3/9/2022,"Ihave to admit: I was initially skeptical of The Dropout, Hulu’s new limited series about the rise and fall of Theranos and its founder Elizabeth Holmes, the billionaire Silicon Valley darling turned convicted corporate fraudster. I’ve been struggling with based-on-a-true-story fatigue. In recent weeks, a wave of TV shows trained on some locus of tech culture, the myth of the messianic founder, the gall of a scam – especially if the scammer is a (white, blonde) woman – and the thrill of exposing a scheme have largely fallen flat. Inventing Anna, Shonda Rhimes’s nine-part Netflix limited series on the “fake heiress” Anna Delvey, was largely an overlong and underwhelming disappointment that cast its inscrutable subject’s ambition in too hazy a glow. Super Pumped, Showtime’s anthology series on the ruthless rise of Uber under disgraced CEO Travis Kalanick, lacquered fourth wall breaks and narration by Quentin Tarantino over paper-thin insight into the relentless drive for profit. Peacock’s Joe v Carole was an uneven and generally unwelcome rehash of Tiger King, the curdled Netflix docuseries on violence and enmity in the world of private zoos – call it the scam of one’s personal realm – but with Kate McKinnon in a wig. It’s yet to be seen how Apple TV’s WeCrashed, out later this month, handles the story of WeWork and its eccentric founders, Adam Neumann (Jared Leto) and wife Rebekah (Anne Hathaway), but safe to say it will fly or flail by the same basic recipe of scam intrigue. This lackluster true-con TV wave has made me wonder: it makes basic business sense to adapt headlining scams into scripted TV, but what do we want from these shows? The speculative power of fiction does allow for new insight; dramatization can fill the emotional crevices of a mosaic of source material – the real-time news coverage, documentaries, podcasts, TV news investigations and commentary. It’s always intriguing to see if an actor can pull off the transformation into a famous figure, one whose ubiquity/notoriety we lived through online. There’s pleasure in playing voyeur to the boardrooms and yachts and open-floor offices where comically vast amounts of money change hands, lies are peddled and consequential decisions are made. But these recent shows have so far felt … off, like plaster cast versions of recent history. Except for The Dropout, which answers the scam show question with a tricky, delicate balance of curiosity and consequence. The eight-part Hulu series from New Girl creator Liz Meriwether, based on the ABC News podcast of the same name by Rebecca Jarvis, traces how Elizabeth Holmes, played doggedly straight by Amanda Seyfried, built a house of cards from the foundation up without indulging in feminist anti-hero refashioning. It’s hard not to compare The Dropout to Inventing Anna: two shows about two ambitious bottle blondes with conspicuously bad split ends and distinctive vocal tics (Delvey’s harsh accent from nowhere, Holmes’s bizarrely lowered pitch) who, despite off-putting behavior, amassed clout in the 2010s through capriciousness and brazen fabrications. Unlike Inventing Anna, The Dropout doesn’t change any names or scramble the timeline. Its journalist character, the Wall Street Journal’s John Carreyrou (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), who appears in later episodes, is actually good at his job. (More scam content: Carreyrou’s book, Bad Blood, itself the basis for Alex Gibney’s 2019 HBO documentary The Inventor, has been optioned by Apple TV for a film by Adam McKay that is, as of now, still in development.) And whereas Inventing Anna seemed in thrall with its subject – the story is framed around a fictional journalist impressed by Anna’s audacity – The Dropout imagines the desperation and emotional extremity undergirding Elizabeth’s lies without obscuring their cost. Take a scene in the third episode when Elizabeth and Theranos head scientist Edmond Ku (an excellent James Hiroyuki Liao) visit an oncology clinic in Nashville for a validation study with Pfizer. (The first three episodes premiered last week, with the final five dropping weekly.) It’s 2008, and Theranos has built a small reputation and a sizable war chest of investments but no functioning blood-testing device. Elizabeth sees the trial as a value-less hurdle – “it’s not supposed to work, it’s a trial” – while Edmond, correctly, sees feigning accurate results to terminal cancer patients as crossing the Rubicon. When a stage 4 breast cancer patient praises Elizabeth, Edmond fumbles the charade and walks out. Elizabeth follows. “These people know that they are participating in a trial, this is how these things are done,” she says, and commands him to continue. Torn between his job and his ethics, he caves. It’s one thing to watch the scammer in action – Seyfried’s Elizabeth here is a stupendous mix of reckless naïveté, genuine greed, astounding compartmentalization and monstrous self-delusion. It’s another to see how people react in real time – the justifications one makes to keep going or trusting, the struggle to square bad behavior with the better person they thought they knew. It’s possible to believe, watching this scene, that Holmes was truly convinced the trial was fine as long as Theranos got the tech eventually. It’s also possible that nothing mattered nearly as much as the appearance of success, as much as the cancer patient taking her hand in gratitude and admiration. It’s possibly both, but it also doesn’t matter; the true horror of the scene, the stakes of The Dropout, is that patient – a person’s health used as a game by Holmes, the real victim of all that investment tossed around like play money. The Dropout allows for all of those readings, and paints Elizabeth Holmes less as a visionary outcast, as some have argued, than as a prolific imitator. She copies the timelines of Jobs and Gates, putting immense pressure on herself to come up with a world-changing idea in early college, then copies again when the idea is promising enough to drop out of Stanford in 2004. She rips off Jobs’s turtlenecks. When investor Larry Ellison (Hart Bochner) tells her to “get the fucking money”, she repeats it with deranged excitement until its mantra-cum-persona. An Apple Genius bar employee accidentally deletes Elizabeth’s data and breaks down in tears, and Elizabeth, seemingly stunned by her sincerity, then channels her in a board meeting scheduled to oust her. (This is nearly a decade before Theranos actually collapsed! The Dropout shows a prolonged, gradual metamorphosis.) “I’m a girl who had a dream to change the world, and I just didn’t know how hard it would be … ” she cries, then slips into the Apple employee’s words verbatim: “I did everything right! I followed all the steps! I was just too quick … ” The board, cowed by her tears and semblance of humility, allows her to stay and bring on her “old friend” / secret boyfriend Sunny Balwani (Naveen Andrews) as COO. Does she believe anything she’s saying? It doesn’t matter. Elizabeth rips off and doubles down on elements of the culture around her, sure, but in the show’s logic, the question of blame isn’t as pressing as the consequences, the tightening of the screws. Not all of The Dropout works; there’s the distracting introduction of iconography – Holmes looking in the mirror in her signature black turtleneck, signature green juice in hand – and heavy-handed moments, such as when her mother Noel (Elizabeth Marvel) refuses to say “I love you” back. But on the whole it achieves what Inventing Anna, Super Pumped and other scam shows have not: a portrait of a real human who perpetuated real, costly, legible harms; an outline of a culture that helped create a myth and benefited from it; depictions of gut-twisting mental gymnastics and the courage needed to blow the whistle. It’s maybe not what we need from TV, but definitely much closer to what we want in a headlining scam story.",Arts/Television & radio,How Theranos drama The Dropout gets scam and tech culture right,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/09/how-theranos-drama-the-dropout-gets-scam-and-tech-culture-right
3/9/2022,"In Dear Evan Hansen, a socially anxious high school senior becomes emotionally enmeshed with the family of a fellow student who has taken his own life. Yet, the character who launches into the show’s opening number is Heidi, Evan’s mother, who is raising him alone and finds herself struggling to support her child as he grows up and away from her. Anybody Have a Map?, Heidi’s heartfelt admission of maternal cluelessness, is a soliloquy cum rock ballad performed straight to the audience. It’s a treat to see maternal preoccupations – fear of failing your children, frustration at your inevitable shortfalls – voiced with such candour. “There is that underpinning of guilt that just always hangs around,” says Rebecca McKinnis, who stars as Heidi, and is a single parent herself. “It’s like, ‘are we doing the right thing?’ No one knows, everyone’s just trying to do their best.” Currently playing in London’s West End, the Tony, Grammy and Olivier award-winning show explores the stresses and strains of two very different parent-child dynamics. On the one hand there is Heidi, whose work and studies leave her little time for her son Evan. On the other there’s Cynthia Murphy, played by Lauren Ward, a stay-at-home mum interrogating her relationship with her son, Connor, in the aftermath of his suicide. Heidi and Cynthia don’t appear to have much in common – in terms of either background or personality – yet their impassioned performance of Anybody Have a Map?, which develops into a duet between the two women, points to a shared feeling. Neither mother knows what she’s doing; each is working things out as she goes along, as we all are. “You can identify with lots of different things depending on when you see it – whether you’re a young mother, an older mother, a grandmother,” says Ward, who has three children herself. She recalls seeing Dear Evan Hansen for the first time during its 2016 Broadway run: “I just sobbed when I saw it; I think it depends on what’s going on in your life.” Not that these are issues only mothers deal with, of course. There are plenty of fathers who will identify with the themes of Dear Evan Hansen. But as the show points out – via Evan’s absent father and the dysfunctionality of Cynthia and her husband Larry’s relationship – it’s all too often mothers who end up shouldering the greatest load when it comes to child rearing, which leads to self-reproach. For Cynthia, it’s the guilt of having not been able to save Connor from the despair that led to his death, while for Heidi it’s the more general day-to-day guilt of not being there for Evan because her time and emotional energy is taken up with material considerations. “You’re paying all of your rent, all of your bills, as opposed to sharing that burden. Hence why Heidi, as a single parent, has to work two jobs, hence why she’s not present as much, and then finds herself feeling a little bit distant from Evan and not really knowing what’s going on with him,” says McKinnis. “As a parent, it’s upsetting and frustrating when suddenly your child is not sharing things with you and you don’t know what’s going on in their head.” Not that we should let Heidi off entirely, she says, particularly when it comes to Evan’s online life, which spirals out of control as he participates in a social media campaign against loneliness that’s based on an elaborate lie. “Heidi could delve deeper if she wanted to,” says McKinnis. At various points in the narrative, Heidi remarks to Evan that he slams shut his laptop every time she comes into his bedroom, yet she takes at face value his explanation that all he’s doing is schoolwork. “She’s letting this go on,” says McKinnis. The show doesn’t make a bogeyman of social media – on the contrary, it highlights the opportunities the internet offers when it comes to sharing experiences and creating support networks. It also acknowledges the important role it plays in the lives of the teenage characters in Dear Evan Hansen, while flagging up the potential for misunderstanding and confusion between these digital natives and their more analogue parents. Having another parent around may make finances easier, but doesn’t necessarily solve any communication issues. We see this in Cynthia and Larry Murphy’s conflicting approaches to their son Connor. While Larry is strict, Cynthia lets him get away with everything, says Ward, not because she doesn’t care but because she’s “worn down from experience after experience” of failing to save her son from his demons. As a result, Cynthia and Larry are not on the same page. “If you’ve got a parent hardlining rules, and you’ve got the other parent undermining those rules because they don’t agree, well, it’s not going to work,” says Ward. Dear Evan Hansen doesn’t present either of these approaches as inherently right or wrong. It focuses instead on the isolation and sense of failure the Murphys, Cynthia in particular, feel in relation to their son, both before and after his death. But, as Ward points out, the show also stresses the power of forgiveness. When Cynthia can forgive herself and her husband for the mistakes they made – as well as Connor for the decision to end his own life – she is able to move on from this painful experience. McKinnis agrees, citing So Big/So Small, the show’s penultimate song, as the moment in which Heidi acknowledges her own failures, forgiving herself and in so doing paving the way for a more open, loving, communicative relationship with her son. It’s a message that all parents could benefit from, McKinnis believes, though forgiving our parenting failures is easier said than done. “We are very, very hard on ourselves. It’s much harder to forgive ourselves than it is to see other people and go: ‘You’re doing fine.’ And we should forgive ourselves because it’s hard – it’s blooming hard work!” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

3/9/2022,"After six seasons and a trip to Japan, Netflix’s Queer Eye franchise is taking its message of love, acceptance and regular haircuts to Germany – without the Fab Five that viewers of the US show know and adore. This is a makeover of the makeover show, and it introduces a brand new German fab five: a Fab Fünf, who are there to spend a week with deserving recipients of their care, attention and insights into efficient shelving units. At first, watching Queer Eye Germany – which launches today – is like visiting an old house long after you have moved out. It looks the same and the structure is just as it was, but the furniture is all different and there’s a photograph of a new family on the wall. Looking at the German hosts is like visiting a seaside waxwork museum, and the Jonathan Van Ness statue is sort of wonky. But it only takes a few moments to adjust to the fact that these are five new people looking at an iPad in a big car on their way to a new town. And it is quite amusing to hear the German language peppered with phrases such as “Go girl!”, “Yas queen”, and, to my surprise, “one-pot”, as in one-pot cooking, which clearly needs no translating. What is most striking is how little of this Queer Eye feels different at all, in the end. There are surface changes: there are certainly more facial tattoos, more piercings, more colourful hair dye and more references to schnitzel. Ultimately, though, the idea of Queer Eye is to restore confidence to people who may have lost it somewhere along the way, and that is a universal state, internationally familiar. In the first episode, we meet the blushing Björn, a single father to an 11-year-old boy, who worries that he isn’t doing a good job as a parent, has a touch too much enthusiasm for sports memorabilia, and dresses almost exclusively in camouflage or slogan T-shirts. The Fab Fünf talk him through his hair and beauty regime (this is the role of David, who is clearly the star and knows it), his wardrobe (Jan-Henrik, a dandy who chooses not to push his penchant for bow ties on to others), his life and emotions (the lovely, empathic Leni), what he cooks at the end of a busy day (Aljosha, who loves a one-pot meal, wholewheat pasta and eyeshadow), and what their house would look like without walls covered in football souvenirs (the ever-smiling Ayan). By the end of it, Björn is ready. Previously, he was too nervous to ask his date any questions about herself. Now, armed with a crossbody bag – the German show’s equivalent of the french tuck, it seems – he is confident enough to not only go on a date with a woman, but to engage with her and enjoy a full, two-sided conversation. The changes are superficial, but you always get the impression that they go much deeper than a beard trim and a new pair of boots. It’s so bloody lovely, and as with the US version, it is hard to watch without getting choked up. Every episode takes the same blueprint and spins it into individual strands of gold. The gang meet a person who, for whatever reason life has thrown at them, has lost the ability to believe in themselves, or to take care of themselves. That’s not to say these people are in dire need of intervention, but they need a treat, a boost, someone like Leni to look them in the eye and tell them they are not alone. The five meet a closeted football coach (who comes out to his wonderful parents mid-makeover); a woman in her 40s who has lost her lust for life; a Star Wars fan who has had depression; and an 18-year-old with a story so sad and harrowing that she deserves every bit of happiness that a life makeover might bring. It is so heartwarming and so human and decent. Feelgood TV travels well, no matter what language it is in. And as they say in Germany: go, girl!",Arts/Television & radio,Say hello to the Fab Fünf!

3/9/2022,"During a psychotic episode, the artist picks up his knife and cuts off his ear, the blood spills on to the canvas and blooms into a bunch of beautiful sunflowers. As Plato said, “All of the good poets are not in their right mind when they make their beautiful songs.” They are mere receptacles through which suffering flows and translates itself into art. This is, of course, absurd. The image of the tortured artist has evolved and become increasingly entrenched, romanticised in order to paint a neat picture of the link between suffering and art.The truth is far more complex. Very often artists make great work in spite of their suffering. Many others are unable to work at all. Imagine a gallery full of the great works of art made if we could have prevented the hardships that were insurmountable obstacles to so many. Grayson Perry suggested the economic impacts of Covid could be a good thing, clearing out the “dead wood”.

Géricault’s, survivors of the raft, my friend Ali’s experiences of blindness and war, and my own buried traumas. I wanted to pull back the curtain, to get inside the complex network of processes that see suffering translated into art. But also to move beyond the spectacle of it all, to think how art might help, might offer a light in darkness – as these books do. 1. The Iceberg by Marion CouttsCoutts is a celebrated visual artist, and her husband, Tom Lubbock, was a renowned art critic. The Iceberg meticulously charts the journey from his diagnosis with a terminal brain tumour, through to his death. As Lubbock’s words are stolen, their child learns to speak. The surgical precision with which Coutts uses language to recall this is a deeply affecting counterpoint. Always searching for and finding the right words, because in that search, through all the pain, it is a portrait of, and hymn to, love. 2. The Death of Francis Bacon by Max PorterSet in the final days of the artist as he lies in a convent hospital bed in Madrid, Porter looks to enter Bacon’s mind, life and body, and the paintings he made. He uses language like paint, or a surgeon’s blade. It is visceral, messy stuff, words chucked and smeared like body fluids spilling over the page in wild imagistic flurries. Porter really gets Bacon, really understands that under all that noise there is always beauty, that the truth beneath is a deep well of mourning and melancholy. 3. The Lonely City by Olivia LaingIn this meditation on loneliness, Laing finds herself caught in the paradox of city life, the teeming masses only exacerbating her feelings of alienation. She moves fluidly from Edward Hopper’s iconic, theatrical scenes of urban isolation, through to Andy Warhol’s lifelong presentation and performance of mechanistic separation and connection. Her portrait of outsider artist Henry Darger is moving and original, recontextualising his violent, beautiful, unsettling eroticism not as certified signifier of a disturbed mind but as indicator of the damage caused by a society that forces people into the margins. Laing’s book, like Darger’s work, is a call to be heard and seen. 4. Red Comet by Heather ClarkWith its focus on new research materials Clark manages to bring a fresh line of inquiry to Sylvia Plath’s life and work. So often Plath’s extraordinary poetry is overshadowed by the preoccupation with her suicide, her troubled relationship with Ted Hughes and her mental health. The suffering is never ignored here, but it doesn’t ever overwhelm or seek to lazily imply it is the root of Plath’s genius. Instead, we are left to revel in a mind capable of occupying an unlimited number of lives, experiences and feelings. 5. What the Water Gave Me by Pascale PetitA collection of poems inspired by the paintings and life of Frida Kahlo. It is a life full of suffering and the poems never shy away from this: they are suffused with feeling, sensation and Jungian explorations of the subconscious. Yet it is the paintings, conjured by the poems, which offer the most compelling portrait of an artist, words acting like threads in a tapestry of staggering complexity and beauty. This is a collection which never shies from the wounds, which demonstrates the healing that can happen when trauma is transformed into paint, and then again into words. 6. Artemisia by Anna BantiBanti saw her home destroyed by German bombs in Italy, taking with it the first draft of her novel. The resulting rewrite is not an act of replication, but seems suffused with the connection that Banti felt through this loss. At points, the novel is dreamlike in its retelling of the life and work of the baroque painter and trailblazer Artemisia Gentileschi. Gentileschi suffered a litany of abuses, but her rape and the subsequent trial threatened to be life defining. It is through her work, and through this reimagining of a life by Banti, that this is not allowed to happen. 7. Bright Stars: Great Artists Who Died Too Young by Kate BryanA stunningly produced book, covering the work and lives of 30 artists who died before they were 40. Each text is accompanied by a vibrant portrait of each artist by illustrator Anna Higgie, and examples of their key work. Yet Bryan intelligently challenges the often simplistic links between biographical suffering and the work produced. The resulting texts are full of nuance and sensitive analysis. The book’s real strength is its focus on artists such as Francesca Woodman, Khadija Saye and Helen Chadwick, managing to not shy away from the suffering they experienced by keeping the lens focused on the power of their work. 8. Citizen: An American Lyric by Claudia RankineRankine’s book-length lyric poem/essay about race relations in the US moves fluidly between discussion of everyday racism through to the explicit and structural. The entire fabric of society meets her gaze, from the artwork of JMW Turner to the writings of James Baldwin and Robert Lowell, anecdotes of microaggressions, analysis of the media around police shootings, the YouTube performances of Hennessy Youngman and her collaboration with John Lucas. 9. Maus by Art SpiegelmanA graphic novel in which the Nazis are cats and the Jews are mice, an extraordinary oral history of Vladek Spiegelman’s life. A metatext in which his son, Art, tries to come to terms with his father’s past and their subsequently difficult relationship. The graphic novel format enables Maus to artfully move between the unimaginable suffering of the Holocaust, survivor’s guilt and the more mundane suffering of old age, petty familial and domestic arguments. Its focus on the specific and the personal are what make it capable of tackling metaphysical and existential questions around human cruelty and the nature of suffering. 10. Book of Mutter by Kate ZambrenoA book that collages fragments of memory, mourning and essayistic engagements with art, photography and text. Principally about Zambreno’s experience of grief following the death of her mother, but becoming a wider meditation on time, and on writing as a form of repair. The book takes its form and feeling from Louise Bourgeois’ cell sculptures, offering up the possibility that the screams and silences of pain might be assembled and circled, but never circumscribed. It writes into and around absences, a sacred secular prayer to the past.  Wreck: Gericault’s Raft and the Art of Being Lost at Sea by Tom de Freston is published by Granta.
