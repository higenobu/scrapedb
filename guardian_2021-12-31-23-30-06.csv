12/31/2021,"The crisis engulfing the Chinese property sector appears certain to intensify in 2022 as companies face debt repayments in the new year that are double those of the final months of 2021, risking what one China expert calls a systemic crisis for the world’s second-biggest economy. Although concerns about the stricken giant China Evergrande have receded in recent weeks behind a massive state-led restructuring operation, it missed a bond repayment of $255m (£190m) on Thursday and the debt problems that have pushed the second biggest developer in the country into default are blighting many other firms.  In total, China’s developers owe $19.8bn in dollar-denominated offshore debt in the first three months of 2022, analysts at Nomura said. That is almost twice as much as the $10.2bn they were faced with in the final quarter of 2021 – a burden that caused default at Evergrande and the threat of default at several other developers such as Kaisa. Nor is there any respite in the second quarter of 2022, when they must find another $18.5bn. The bond repayment burden threatens to worsen the crisis for developers, who have ridden a 30-year boom in the Chinese housing market on a business model based on cheap credit and never-ending demand from the country’s huge, upwardly mobile population. But Xi Jinping’s anger at the sector’s excesses and his pursuit of “common prosperity” led to a crackdown that removed access to unlimited funding, and now key metrics are spelling the end of the good times. Prices fell 0.3% in November, the biggest fall since 2015, while the value of home sales plunged by 16.31% and new construction starts as measured by floor area fell 21.03%. Crucially, China’s population is shrinking with the number of marriages – and therefore demand for new properties from young couples – down 31% in the six years to 2019. Michael Pettis, professor of finance at Peking University, says the situation could morph into a systemic crisis that undermines the whole debt-ridden economy – the stuff of nightmares for Beijing’s political class, who are desperate to prevent contagion from the property crisis hurting ordinary Chinese. “Everyone made the same bet on inexorably rising property prices, especially the developers, who levered to the hilt, overpaid for land at auctions, and scooped up as much real estate risk as they could take on,” he said. “The problem of course is if property prices ever stop rising, because everyone has made the same bet everyone’s balance sheet starts unravelling at the same time, and it immediately becomes a systemic problem. That is what has happened in China.” Debt to foreign investors are not the only problem. Developers owe billions of yuan to Chinese bondholders but, in addition, Nomura says they must also find 1.1tn yuan ($172bn) in backdated pay owed to construction workers before the lunar new year starts at the beginning of February. There were also reports that workers at subsidiaries of Evergrande in states such as Guangxi and Shanxi have gone on strike over unpaid wages. “Failing to pay deferred wages could be severely punished by both the central government and related local governments,” the Nomura analysts said. “There is tremendous reputational risk for those developers and constructors that could not pay deferred wages in a timely manner, especially if social protests are triggered.” Evergrande’s woes become apparent in September when it admitted it could not meet the most pressing of its mammoth $300bn debts or even complete the 1.6m homes it had already taken payment for. After much brinkmanship, it made some of its payments but eventually slipped into default in early December – later confirmed by rating agency downgrades. The prospect of civil unrest over unpaid wages, unfinished houses, and uncertain return from wealth management products set up by developers is front and centre in Beijing’s battle to contain the fallout from the property sector’s problems. Although the Evergrande chairman and founder, Xu Jiayin, pledged this week that the company was going “full steam ahead” to finish homes that customers had paid for, Shasha Dai, managing editor at credit intelligence, data and analytics provider Reorg in New York, said the Chinese government was “deeply involved” in Evergrande’s restructuring and that the number one priority was to maintain “social stability”. The government was “putting a mould around Evergrande” to make sure its troubles didn’t spill over to other developers, she said. The goal was for someone “reputable” to come in with access to finance, complete the buildings Evergrande has not finished, and get people into homes that they have paid for. “Maintaining social stability is the government’s number one priority. They can’t have protests with people going round to offices demanding money back – it’s a bad image. Homebuyers have to get what they paid for.” However, the spiralling nature of the problem might make it impossible even for Beijing, with all its levers of control, to contain given that so many developers could run into trouble. A report in October by S&P, for example, said that one-third of China’s listed developers could experience liquidity problems in the next 12 months. As Prof Pettis says, the crisis has deep-seated roots and will not be easily solved. “This isn’t about ‘bad apples’ or even bad policies,” he says, “so it cannot be fixed by firing the right people, putting some in jail and improving policy responses.” The impact will be felt far and wide if the contagion spreads, not least to China’s reputation for sound economic management. Tim Symes, a partner at the international law firm Stewarts in London and a specialist in insolvency and asset recovery, said the Evergrande restructuring could go on for years. But the wider question for China was important. “This is a test case for China and could shape risk appetite globally, affecting inward investment. “This is going to run and run and the fear is that China may favour its local creditors. Offshore bondholders will feel the loss and that will ripple through the world. It brings home the risks in lending to China.”",News/Business,Evergrande: ‘Everyone bet on inexorably rising Chinese property prices’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/31/evergrande-chinese-property-sectors-debt-crisis-to-intensify-in-2022
12/31/2021,"Born in South Africa, educated privately in the UK, settled with his wife and three children in the hipster heart of east London but speaking today from Rome, Johnny Flynn gets around. The actor-musician (half-brother to Jerome Flynn of the chart-topping acting-singing duo Robson and Jerome) is currently shooting a new TV version of Patricia Highsmith’s The Talented Mr Ripley. This one is being adapted and directed by Steven Zaillian, who wrote Schindler’s List and The Irishman, and stars Andrew Scott as the amoral antihero. Flynn, who has long forks of blond hair, as well as a scar in the shape of a question mark rising from the bridge of his nose (the result of a dog attack when he was three), plays Ripley’s idol-cum-quarry, Dickie Greenleaf. It is the role for which Jude Law was Oscar-nominated in Anthony Minghella’s highly regarded 1999 film version. Daunting? “I won’t lie,” he grins when we talk via Zoom. “It’s definitely something I’m trying not to think about, which is an effort because I love that film.” This new spin, he says, is “quite beautiful and quite noir. It’s in the Fellini zone.”  The shoes he fills in the new wartime yarn Operation Mincemeat are even more illustrious than Jude Law’s loafers. The film concerns a real-life bit of second world war deception involving fake papers planted on a corpse to convince Hitler that the Allies were heading for Greece rather than Sicily. As a pre-James Bond Lt Cmdr Ian Fleming, Flynn is on the outskirts of the action, tapping away at his typewriter and amassing ideas for his future novels. Matthew Macfadyen – toadying Tom from Succession – is one of his fellow goodies. “Matthew is the sweetest, loveliest guy,” he says. “It’s quite a leap for me when I watch him as Tom. He’s really silly on set, loves giggling. We got told off a few times.” Flynn goes wide-eyed as he considers his other co-stars: “Colin Firth. Simon Russell Beale. Oh, Kelly Macdonald! I had such a crush on her when I was growing up, from Trainspotting.” He wrinkles his brow. “Sorry, that’s kind of creepy.” Then a rethink: “I’m sure it’s OK, lots of people did who were a certain age when that film came out.” Now 38, he would have been 13 at the time: I think he’s in the clear. Do he and Fleming have similar backgrounds? “I suppose so. The private school thing.” His memories of those years – first at the Pilgrims’ school in Winchester, then Bedales – are not entirely happy ones. “I was sent off to boarding school at the age of eight on a music scholarship, which was quite traumatic. Now my kids are around that age, it’s really poignant to me. It’s definitely something I think about.” He looks suddenly downcast. Talk of Fleming leads to Bond. Would he care to throw his hat in the ring? “I don’t think I’m hard enough,” he says, practically retreating into his cosy brown pullover. “I literally don’t think I could hack the training. It’s potentially a poisoned chalice. It can be so defining, and I do like the freedom to do lots of different projects.” In the past decade, this has included everything from the Netflix romcom Lovesick and a featherweight film of Jane Austen’s Emma (he was Mr Knightley) to the arthouse gem Clouds of Sils Maria, in which he shared a scene with Kristen Stewart, Juliette Binoche and Chloë Grace Moretz. If he has a brand, it’s rustic: he was an archaeologist in the Sutton Hoo drama The Dig and a charismatic poacher and possible serial killer in the Jersey-set thriller Beast, as well as popping up in the plangent BBC comedy Detectorists, for which he provided the lilting theme song. He has done a fine job of balancing acting with albums: his latest folk collection, Lost in the Cedar Wood, was co-written with the nature writer Robert Macfarlane, inspired by The Epic of Gilgamesh, and characterised, as Flynn himself is, by an earthy, rough-hewn beauty. One blip last year was Bowie. Playing him in Stardust, set during the singer’s pre-Ziggy days, Flynn was in the firing line before so much as a frame of the film had been seen. Bowie’s son, Duncan Jones, threw shade at the movie on Twitter; fan fury and bad reviews followed. It was all very much not hunky dory. “I didn’t go into it with my eyes closed,” he says now. “But I hoped people would take it for how it was intended. It was supposed to be this tiny independent film about a young artist, who just happened to be David Bowie, trying to find his voice, which I thought was a valid story to tell. It got judged for what it wasn’t rather than what it was. I was unhappy with some of the marketing around it. As the trailers were coming out, I could see mistakes being made and I felt sad that it wasn’t going to be seen. I’m still proud of it. These things are your babies. You put everything into them, and you want people to see the best in them.” There are always other babies. On its way is The Outfit, a period crime drama with Mark Rylance, his stage co-star from plays including Jerusalem. Then there is The Score, a heist movie with Will Poulter in which the characters burst into song. Flynn’s own songs, to be precise. He’s thrilled with that one, he says, and generally happy to watch himself. “I’m always interested to see how it turns out. You think: ‘I was sure that bit was gonna be shit but it’s good.’ Or: ‘My hair looks better than I thought it would.’” Operation Mincemeat is released 22 April.",Arts/Film,‘I couldn’t hack being Bond’: Johnny Flynn on playing 007-creator Ian Fleming,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/31/johnny-flynn-talented-mr-ripley-bond-ian-fleming-operation-mincemeat
12/31/2021,"What have you achieved this year? Perhaps that question causes your chest to swell with pride – or perhaps you are now looking back at the vista of a somewhat disappointing year, good intentions fallen by the wayside, vowing to do better in 2022.My year is a tale of two halves. I spent the first six months in a frenzy of activity – finishing off and then promoting a book, ticking off solid, bankable achievements, and then … well, not very much since. That wasn’t the plan: I had imagined that after a long holiday after my book was published, I’d return to full productivity in the autumn, pre-emptively making to-do lists and outlining my goals – but the energy to do those things has yet to materialise. In fact, I have written barely anything in months.  It’s not burnout – I don’t think. I’ve experienced burnout before, but this feels different. It is more of a general (and wholly involuntary) slowing down, one that’s forced me to drastically rethink my desired goal of being 100% productive, 100% of the time, and the idea that that’s even humanly possible. It’s been a tough pill to swallow. I find myself ricocheting between frustration and shame about my recent lack of productivity, and feel intense guilt about doing only the bare minimum, which is all I can muster the energy for right now. I feel I am letting myself down, that I am wasting my time. And yet I know that I have more to offer the world than just my labour. I don’t believe that my personal worth is defined by my productivity – but I am keenly aware that my material reality is. Especially being self-employed, my professional success and my finances are tied to how productive I am, and so the stress of not working is acute, because if I am not working, then I am not earning money, or even laying the groundwork to do so at a future date. Where does the idea that we can achieve, or should even be aiming for, endless productivity come from? Arguably we’ve been barrelling towards this conclusion for as long as capitalism has existed, but the technological advances of the past few decades have further eroded the barriers around work that stop it seeping into every aspect of our lives. There is a widespread cultural fetishisation of productivity, with overwork framed as a virtue by employers desperate to find ways to motivate a workforce for whom the traditional rewards – a decent salary, pension, job security – often no longer apply. There has been some pushback against this in recent years, specifically with the rise of the anti-work movement – the notion that we might begin to claw back our time from the crushing grind of overwork. But even as I vow to reframe my views on productivity, I have to confess that only half of me really wants to – the other half just wants to work. The process of coming to terms with my reduced productivity has borne an uncanny resemblance to the five stages of grief: denial (pushing through); anger (at myself); bargaining (allowing myself a holiday in exchange for the increased productivity I assumed would subsequently follow); depression (I think that one’s pretty self-explanatory); and now I find myself tentatively, begrudgingly, edging towards acceptance. Still, I’m prone to occasional pangs of envy. How does she do it? I whisper to one friend about another, who seems to juggle an unfathomable number of commitments without pause. I am half hoping to hear that said friend injects herself with a cocktail of miracle vitamins each morning, something I could emulate. It is not her achievements I covet, but rather her energy levels, and what I, too, could achieve were I able to apply them to my own life. Even though I know at an intellectual level that one cannot constantly operate at full force, I am still working on applying that logic to myself.So that is my big realisation of 2021. That my brain’s natural limits are not something to be outmanoeuvred or somehow “hacked”. That work needs to be counterbalanced with periods of rest – probably more rest than we generally think necessary, given a working culture that typically only allows for 25 days of annual leave a year (if you’re lucky). That the need for rest is especially pressing when one is operating in a state of constant high alert – during, for example, a global pandemic – when the conditions of everyday life can change from moment to moment, and where the mere act of existing feels suspiciously like work. So I’m allowing myself a little grace. If your year has been less fruitful than you’d planned, I hope you’ll allow yourself some, too.

12/31/2021,"In 1979, the Stasi entered Ralf Winkler’s Dresden studio and trashed the place. It was the culmination of a harassment campaign against the artist, who found fame under the pseudonym AR Penck, for refusing to make social-realist propaganda. Instead, his paintings featured oft-repeated hieroglyphs, odd symbols and signs, seemingly child-like naive scrawls and simple stick men (often with outsized penises). The authorities were right to be suspicious of this new painterly style: Penck sought the construction of a new language, one that mixed the linguistic and pictorial, that was both “universal” and “democratic”. It was a wish born of the trauma of the second world war, particularly witnessing the destruction of Dresden as a child, and the ensuing dystopia of the German Democratic Republic.  Penck’s visual language, which he termed “standart” is, on the surface at least, one that could be mastered by anyone. There is a “building block system”, as he once said; a glossary of motifs to be picked out and played with on a whim. In fact, few would bring the rhythm and lyricism that Penck, a jazz fan, brought to the canvas. With their profusion of wide eyes, humanoid forms, beasts and birds, his paintings are suggestive of the real world, but they also lean on theories of abstraction, in which noughts, crosses and other symbols flirt across a work’s surface with a pride in pure painterly gesture. Escaping his censors, Penck smuggled paintings to the west with the help of Cologne gallerist Michael Werner, whose gallery the artist worked with until his death in 2017, and who now represents the Penck estate. A new show at Werner’s London townhouse gallery traces the artist’s career, from his beginning to the international stardom he eventually found. Most accounts note it was the Stasi raid that catalysed his defection in 1980 but, more likely, the East Berlin regime sold the artist to their counterparts across the wall as part of the lucrative and highly secret Häftlingsfreikauf programme, which allowed the GDR to bring in much-needed foreign currency and rid itself of intellectual troublemakers. Either way, for Penck, it came as a relief. Settling in Cologne, the artist hung out with Georg Baselitz, Jörg Immendorff, Anselm Kiefer and Sigmar Polke, a gang the press dubbed the Neue Wilde – the Young Savages. More formally, throughout the 1980s these artists developed neo-expressionism between them, a form of painting characterised by its rough emotional pull. While Penck’s importance to this new genre was confirmed by his appearance in key survey shows, Zeitgeist at the Gropius Bau, Berlin, in 1982, and New Art at the Tate, London, a year later, the artist’s source material reveals a more nuanced set of references. The science fiction Penck read as a child while the RAF carpet-bombed Dresden remained an enduring influence, while a set of rarely seen textile sculptures, included in the new Werner exhibition, underline his interests in genetics, ecology, systems theory and cybernetics. With his work, Penck sought to understand how people, objects and ideas rubbed up against each other, how thoughts could be expressed beyond words and how a path out of the inherent conflict of the world might be mapped. Untitled, 1966 In one of the earliest works in the exhibition, the artist’s interest in systems are on show. A man is seen picking a fruit, before he is shown eating and lastly defecating. Far from demonstrating man’s divine supremacy over nature, his internal organs are reduced to nodes in a natural ecosystem. tskrie VIII, 1984 Penck also spent time in London. The title of the largest work in the show is an anagram of “strike”, and is a homage to the miners’ struggle. Despite the harassment he received in East Germany, Penck was sympathetic to socialism. “Everything is paradox and schizophrenic … reactionary and progressive, decadent and fascistic,” he said of his work’s politics. “So am I! So are you!” Y, 1978 We can assume this is a self-portrait, even though the stick man has no features. “Y” was one of a number of names Penck exhibited under (others include “Mickey Spilane” and “Theodor Marx”). Werner would arrive at his studio, dropping off forbidden music, books and, as Penck became successful, bags of West German marks. In return he would smuggle out paintings signed under the fictitious guises. Reaktor, 1990 Penck wanted children to enjoy his work, despite its intellectual underpinnings. His felt sculptures are playful, but dozens of sketches included in this new show reveal that he designed the interconnecting tubes and balls with a molecular understanding of how humans have altered the very building blocks of nature. This work was made four years after the Chernobyl disaster.

12/31/2021,"New year resolutions in relation to booze almost always involve self-denial, but let me suggest an alternative: drink less but better. The problem with giving up for an extended period is that at some point you have to adjust to drinking again. Having just one drink a day in January (my preferred strategy), or taking two to three days off a week (and maybe even four, at least for this month), creates a more healthy drinking pattern. Combine that with an emphasis on quality over quantity, and it becomes a sustainable lifestyle. You may quite reasonably point out that you haven’t got cash to splash at this time of year, but I’m not advocating increasing your booze budget, rather reallocating it. Add up what you spend on alcohol in the average week (average perhaps not being the run-up to Christmas), and spend it on something better – you could pick up a more than decent bottle for the cost of a couple of cocktails, for example. Plus, you should still be able to take advantage of Christmas offers this weekend, as well as bin-end and sale reductions during the coming month.  Drinking better doesn’t just mean spending more, however; it also means drinking with a spirit of adventure. Explore a new country, wine region or grape variety each month. Overcome your prejudices. I’ve never been much of a fan of vouvray, for example, which I generally find too sweet, but I recently had a glass of Huet’s 2016 Demi-Sec at Noble Rot in London and was blown away by it. (Incidentally, Noble Rot’s list is available in cutback-friendly 75ml glasses.) You could also think of buying your wine in alternative formats – half-bottles, say, or even cans. (The Banks Brothers’ canned wine range from South Africa, fronted by chef Tommy Banks and his brother James, is an unusually good one.) Buying in bigger quantities such as wine boxes, meanwhile, may seem counterintuitive, but if you’ve got the self-discipline to pour yourself just one small glass, a box could last the best part of a month. Wine boxes aside, there is also the issue of how to keep your wine fresh if you don’t drink the whole bottle. Air is the enemy of wine, so once a bottle is only half full, decant it into a smaller bottle and keep it in the fridge. There’s also a nifty little gadget called Sayv (£4.95 slurp.co.uk) that sprays a layer of argon gas over the wine to keep it fresh, which is especially useful when you want to open more than one bottle at once.

12/31/2021,"My husband and I and our two children (aged six and two) recently moved into a bigger house so my mum could come and live with us. She is in her late 70s and was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. We work part-time and share childcare, and agreed to have my mum with us so we could provide a stable home as she was no longer able to live alone. I am keen that, where possible, I am not her carer – we have two assistants who help with personal care, medication and medical appointments.  However, we often end up “caring” for her in terms of cooking, washing, taking her on days out and so on. One thing we struggle with is when we ask her what she needs or would like, and she turns the question round to ask what we need, or how she can help us. In reality, there is little she can do, though we are happy for her to wash up or hang laundry, even if this takes a long time and ends up incomplete. When she persistently tries to offer help, it becomes a flashpoint for my husband and me, and makes what should be a simple interaction stressful and upsetting. This behaviour predates the dementia – she was a wonderful and kind single mother who has always gone out of her way to look after others. We want so much to look after her, but it would be so much easier for us if she could accept the help with a simple “thank you!”. It’s wonderful that you’ve brought your mother to live with you, but you’ve taken on a lot, with work and young children. I wonder if you’ve let yourself acknowledge that? I used to think looking after older relatives was about the physical impact, but the psychological one is far greater. There’s also a shift between you and your mum, with you taking on a more parental role. And that’s really hard: for both, there’s often an unspoken loss at its core. I suspect this has become a flashpoint not because of what she says, but because of what it triggers in you. I wonder if next time she says it, you could consider how it really makes you feel? Because I do think there’s an unvoiced emotion here. I contacted Julie Green of Dementia UK: “You’ve done a fantastic thing, but you are a carer for your mum and a mother. When there’s no time for self, that’s when people can get resentful.” She also pointed out something vital, which is that “every one of us has the need for meaningful activities; we need to feel valued, [and] that we are here for a reason.” Your mum wanting to help is what defines her, and she may be suffering a loss of self-confidence and self-esteem. You may not be able to stop her saying it, but you may be able to handle it differently. Green suggested looking at chores and writing a list so your mum could tick off what she’s done, and you could also give her feedback. This will save not only time in the long run, but frustration, too. Then when your mum asks how she can help, you can say, “You’ve already done this. How about doing something for fun?”. Here Green suggests looking at what your mum likes to do: knitting, singing, anything she usually enjoys. A vital piece of advice I want to pass on is not to get caught up in what is or isn’t happening, but concentrate on your mum’s feelings. Your mum may forget things, but facts don’t matter here; feelings, however, do. How you make someone feel is crucial. But how you feel is also really important, so please get support. If things get too much, please don’t feel bad about looking into short-term (a few days’) respite care at a local residential home for your mum.

12/31/2021,"Hundreds of mourners queued outside Saint George’s cathedral in Cape Town, waiting to pay their respects before the plain wooden casket bearing the remains of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who died six days ago aged 90. Clerics, family members, close friends and dignitaries will attend a requiem mass for Tutu, the icon of the fight for freedom in South Africa, on Saturday morning. Their numbers will be restricted due to Covid regulations. President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to read a eulogy.  Though the former archbishop of Cape Town had largely retreated from public life in recent years, Tutu had continued his lifelong fight for causes he believed in, forcefully supporting LGBT rights, equal access to education and the assisted dying movement. Tributes from world leaders poured in after Tutu’s death was announced on Sunday, and within South Africa, many have been deeply moved by the passing of the last great hero of the struggle against the repressive, racist apartheid regime. In a national address earlier this week, Ramaphosa called Tutu a man of “extraordinary intellect, integrity and invincibility against the forces of apartheid”. Church bells have been rung at noon across South Africa every day and flags flown at half-mast for the man often described as the “moral compass” of his country. There have been dozens of memorial services, South Africa’s cricket team wore black armbands on day one of the first Test against India in South Africa, and Cape Town’s Table Mountain was lit up in purple in Tutu’s honour. Tutu, who requested a funeral without lavish expense or ostentation, would be cremated and his ashes interred beneath the floor of St George’s behind the cathedral pulpit, church officials said. Since Thursday morning, mourners have filed through the cathedral to light candles. Many sat in the pews to pray and reflect. The cathedral, the Anglican church’s oldest in southern Africa, dating back to 1847, was converted by Tutu into a centre of anti-apartheid activity during the 1980s. When the apartheid regime banned political gatherings, Tutu held meetings in the cathedral where participants bowed their heads ostensibly in prayer and heard political speeches. Nelson Mandela, a close friend of the cleric, called it the “People’s Cathedral”. Among the mourners were young activists who said they had been inspired by “The Arch”, as Tutu was known locally. “We believe the Arch stood for the same values that we want to aspire to in society,” Irfaan Mangera, a pro-Palestinian South African activist, told Reuters as he waited in the long queue, draped in the Palestinian keffiyeh. “[Tutu] was one of the figures who continuously united us … and we want to continue in that path as young South African activists who emulate the values of non-racialism and non-sexism.” Others remembered Tutu’s modesty. “He was a very humble man but to sit in the same room with him, you could feel the strength of his presence, of his convictions,” said Rev Maria Claassen, an Anglican priest in Cape Town’s Durbanville area. “He inspired us and now we celebrate his life.” Amanda Mbikwana, 29 and born shortly before the end of apartheid, said she had come to remember Tutu for “all he has done for us as Africans”. Tutu’s career in the church began after he resigned a sought-after teaching post in protest against South Africa’s discriminatory laws in 1958. By the late 1970s, the diminutive cleric was one of the leaders of the freedom struggle best known overseas and played a leading role in forcing western leaders to confront the moral cost of cold war calculations that led to tacit support for white-minority rule in South Africa. In recent years, Tutu did not shy away from criticism of the African National Congress party, in power in South Africa for 27 years, attacking the party’s failures and alleged corruption. The service will be an Anglican requiem mass led by Michael Nuttall, the retired bishop of Natal, who was known as “number two to Tutu”, church officials said. After the viewing on Friday, Tutu’s body will remain alone in the cathedral, “a place that he loved”, according to a statement from Archbishop of Cape Town, Thabo Makgoba.",News/World news,Hundreds pay respects to Desmond Tutu ahead of low-key funeral,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/31/desmond-tutu-funeral-hundreds-pay-respects
12/31/2021,"Boris Johnson comes out of hiding to announce that the government’s ‘sensible and cautious approach’ of letting people do exactly what they liked over New Year’s Eve has paid off as Covid cases have declined to zero. The newly knighted Sir Chris Whitty later admits this may be due to there being no LFTs or PCR tests available to determine whether people are ill or not. All hospitals are now officially full. Jonathan Van-Tam refuses to take part in any further Downing Street press conferences until he too is also knighted. Prince Andrew takes up residence in the Ecuadorian embassy after the Queen kicks him out of Windsor Castle. Lord Geidt announces that the Downing Street refurb was far too complicated to investigate properly so he is going to exonerate everyone because he doesn’t want to upset anyone. Johnson immediately invites him to take over the investigation into the Downing Street parties.  The coldest spell since the last coldest spell grips the country. Boris Johnson comes out of hiding to say that no one could possibly have predicted extreme bad weather in February and urges everyone to wrap up warm. Mainly because no one can afford to keep their central heating on as fuel bills have quadrupled in the last six months. Johnson insists that no one could have possibly predicted that gas prices would rise so rapidly, despite everyone having done just that. The worst floods since the last worst floods devastate many towns and villages as the weather turns milder. Boris Johnson comes out of hiding to put a sandbag in the wrong place. Coronavirus cases reach their highest recorded figure yet. Boris Johnson comes out of hiding to claim that the government is a victim of its own success. With LFTs and PCRs once again available, people have been testing themselves too frequently. To bring the numbers down, everyone will now only be entitled to take one test every three weeks. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, describes this as a masterstroke. Patrick Vallance, now Lord Vallance after also having a hissy fit over Chris Whitty’s knighthood, suggests that everyone needs a fourth jab to manage the ongoing pandemic. Steve Baker, Mark Francois and Julia Hartley-Brewer set up an online petition calling for an end to the nanny state of vaccine passports. It is time for the weak and vulnerable to stop being so selfish. Boris Johnson comes out of hiding to say he would never dream of implementing another booster programme. With tax rises coming into effect and inflation now running at close to 6%, most people have never felt quite so broke. Boris Johnson comes out of hiding to declare that he knows how badly the country is hurting as he is struggling to pay for seven or eight children and that the Labour government of 1977 is to blame for the current crisis. Carrie Johnson announces that she and Boris are expecting twins late on in the year. Dilyn the Dog makes history by becoming the first mutt ever to officially request he be taken away from his current owners and be rehoused elsewhere. Boris Johnson opens a new door, to replace one that was broken, at St George’s hospital and declares the government has now delivered on its promise to build 40 new hospitals. He also announces yet another booster vaccination programme. Much to his surprise, as he has spent the past few weeks campaigning against perfectly sensible public health measures, Sir Graham Brady, chair or the 1922 Committee, discovers that he has been sitting on the necessary 54 letters to trigger a leadership election for at least two months. Boris Johnson comes out of hiding to declare he intends to prorogue parliament and that the leadership challenge is all a cunning plot by EU member states to discredit the UK. Keir Starmer points out Boris has managed to do all that on his own. Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss briefly suspend their leadership election campaigns that have been running all year to pay tribute to Johnson’s immense contribution to screwing up the country and making their lives so much easier. Lord Geidt hints that he may soon be ready to publish his report on parties in Downing Street. To everyone’s amazement, Matt Hancock nominates himself a second time for Tory leader, saying it is time for a proper “Sex God” to be running the country. He releases two publicity photos, one of him in a black roll-neck sweater and the other of him stripped to the waist. “It’s time to turn the country back on” is his catchy slogan. Rishi Sunak takes on a punishing series of Q&As in his trademark sliders, insisting that it had been an entirely different Dishi Rishi who had been the chancellor responsible for hiking the tax take to its highest levels since the 1940s. The Tory leadership election comes down to a two-horse race between Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, after Michael Gove yet again fails to get any support from his fellow MPs. Proving that they do have a sense of humour after all, the Tory party chooses Truss to be the new prime minister. Her first speech outside Downing Street, in which she promises to level up the driveways of peers and Tory donors, has to be delayed after it is revealed that Boris Johnson is refusing to leave No 10 on the grounds that he doesn’t have anywhere to go. Friendly billionaires are unwilling to let Boris and Carrie stay in their private villas now they are all washed up, and it is the unfortunate Lord Brownlow who is again strong-armed into helping the couple find a room in a refuge centre. Lord Geidt gives his strongest hint yet that he is almost ready to publish his report. Twitter crashes for a couple of days as news leaks that the fourth series of Succession will be filmed in real real time. Not pretend real time, like 24. Any mistakes just become part of the script. Jeremy Strong is said to have been doing intensive method preparation for Kendall’s 10-minute lavatory break, which is set to be the pivotal moment of episode four. Brian Cox’s lines have been reduced to a minimalist “Fuck the lot of you, you fucking fucks.” Cricket writers herald a golden dawn for English Test cricket after Joe Root and Jos Buttler put together a 50-run partnership, England’s highest stand for more than three years. Root goes on to make a cultured 37, before playing at a ball he could easily leave and being caught at slip, an innings some older cricket supporters compare to Len Hutton in his prime. Boris Johnson comes out of hiding to announce that he has been deselected by his constituency and is now broke. “I have been morally bankrupt for years,” he sobs, “but now I am also financially bankrupt. Even Lord Brownlow won’t lend me a tenner.” HarperCollins have cancelled his delayed biography of Shakespeare on the grounds they have just realised Johnson doesn’t have anything to say about him that you couldn’t find in Wikipedia. And none of the usual agencies that specialise in $250K-a-pop after-dinner speaking for ex-prime ministers and failed heads of states have been able to get Boris any gigs, as everyone has already heard all the gags and are bored of the lies. Even the Daily Telegraph won’t give him his columns back as the editor has belatedly realised he always writes the same thing over and over again. Charles Moore calls it “a national tragedy that Britain’s finest ever leader since Owen Paterson has been deserted in his time of need”, before going hunting for the rest of the day. At the Tory party conference, Liz Truss insists that from now on she be called “Gloriana, Empress of the United Kingdom and all her Colonies.” Rishi Sunak announces that enough is enough. The tax take is too high for even someone with a wife with a billionaire father to get by on, so he is leaving politics and going back to Goldman Sachs to offshore more of his loot. Truss barely bothers to hide her lack of disappointment and says she will be taking over his job. As she never got round to replacing either herself at the Foreign Office or Priti Patel, whom she sacked as home secretary, this is the first time the four great offices of state have been held by the same person. Opinion polls also show Truss to be now even less popular than Johnson had been. She responds by banning anyone – not just civil servants – from using the word “Brexit”. It is now to be replaced by “The Great Success”, as UK trade with the EU and the rest of the world tumbles to an all-time low. Liz Truss says that nothing is going to stop the UK having the best Christmas ever. A day later the World Health Organization reports the existence of the Pi coronavirus variant, which is four times as transmissible as Omicron. Lord Vallance and Sir Chris Whitty suggest an immediate fifth booster vaccine programme and a circuit-breaker. Truss conducts a solo press conference from a golden throne in which she insists that the British DNA is now resistant to Covid and that the England football team will still be going to Qatar to play in the World Cup. The first 1,000-page volume of Dominic Cummings’s memoir, Why I was Right about Everything, covering the first seven years of his life, becomes the first book to be remaindered within a week of publication. With the Pi variant now seemingly out of control, Liz Truss waits until three days before Christmas before imposing a lockdown. No one is too bothered as they had already cancelled their arrangements on the grounds they didn’t trust the government to come to a sensible decision. Piers Corbyn, Toby Young and three-quarters of the Tory party write an open letter to the Daily Telegraph saying they alone understand the science and calling for someone to do something clinically insane. Despite the entire team getting Covid, England win the World Cup by default as no other country bothers to turn up to the tournament. Truss proclaims them all to be heroes. Sir Chris Whitty rounds off a perfect year by winning Strictly Come Dancing – his salsa is a sensation – and is elevated to a peerage. Lord Vallance and Sir Jonathan Van-Tam are gutted. Lord Geidt says he is nearly, nearly ready to publish his report. A Farewell to Calm by John Crace is published by Guardian Faber, price £9.99.
