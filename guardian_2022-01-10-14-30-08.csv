1/10/2022,"It was 7.55am one February day in 2018 when members of an elite Italian police squad raided the Naples office of small news website. The previous day it had revealed links between elected politicians and organised groups in an illegal waste dumping racket, and its staff already at their desks looked on incredulously as the officers searched through their files. The story sent shock waves through the political establishment and helped make fanpage.it what it is today: one of Italy’s most successful news sites.  “That day was a turning point,” said Sacha Biazzo, the journalist behind the investigation, who, with a hidden camera and the support of a former mobster, filmed meetings between members of the Neapolitan mafia and politicians. “Since then, people realised we weren’t just a small online news and gossip outlet. They began to view us as an investigative website that could strike at the heart of political power. Readers began to deliver pizzas to our office as a gesture of gratitude for what we had done.” Nearly four years on, and now with 67 journalists and editors, Fanpage has become a thorn in the side of politicians, mobsters and common criminals, and gets 3 million unique visitors a day. When it was founded in the early 2000s, the outlook was completely different. “At the beginning, Fanpage was just a Facebook page containing general news and videos on a range of topics,” said Francesco Cancellato, its editor-in-chief. “Over time, the publisher realised that we could aspire to do something different, so he started hiring journalists to write the first articles. From a Facebook page, Fanpage became a news outlet with few opinion stories and a lot of news that ranged from gossip to crime. Then we opened an investigative team […] our goal was to bring new leads to the attention of the authorities investigating corruption and criminality.” Nicknamed Backstair, the Fanpage investigative team is staffed by undercover journalists with hidden cameras whose assignments can last up to two years. Its stated goal is to “reach the highest levels of power without succumbing to vertigo” and “plumb the depths of the darkest corners of society … filming everything, verifying it all and publicising the truth.” In a digital age that has presented challenges to some traditional models of journalism, Fanpage is breaking some of the biggest scandals involving the church, politicians, businessmen and criminals. In 2017 a Fanpage journalist posing as a seminarian recorded an elderly priest’s account of sexual abuse of dozens of hearing-impaired people in an institute in Verona. This October a series of video investigations on the relationship between rightwing political parties and neofascist movements, including alleged financial contributions, was awarded the European Award for Investigative and Judicial Journalism, and led to an MEP from the far-right Brothers of Italy party being placed under investigation by the Milan prosecutor’s office. The MEP said in a statement suspending himself from the party that he had never received illegal funding and did not hold racist, antisemitic or extremist views. Corrado Formigli, a TV host who rebroadcast the investigation on his PiazzaPulita talkshow on the TV channel La7, said Fanpage’s strength was its long-term commitment to stories. “It has created an investigation team capable of working on a project for months, if not years, which is very difficult today given that newspapers and television are often forced to deal with current affairs,” he said. “Behind Fanpage’s use of hidden cameras there is a deep, thorough work which involves creating a false identity for the undercover journalist and a patient approach to sources. The end result is extraordinary and it works great.” Over the last four years dozens of people involved in illicit activities have been arrested after Fanpage investigations and numerous politicians have resigned. The site continues to turn a profit and has opened newsrooms in Rome and Milan. What makes Fanpage even more remarkable is its southern Italian origins. It was founded in Naples, the biggest city in one of Europe’s most disadvantaged regions, plagued by high unemployment and enduring social and economic challenges. “From Naples, Fanpage has not only reported on the south’s problems, it has also hired many young southern Italians, many of whom struggled to find a job in Italian mainstream journalism,” said Adriano Biondi, who started at Fanpage as an intern and is now its deputy editor. “The south, and Naples in particular, are some of the most culturally fertile areas of Europe. There is an enormous untapped resource in terms of human capital, especially among women. If we consider education, women have higher levels than men in Italy, yet Italian women have some of the highest unemployment rates in Europe.” The majority of Fanpage’s journalists and editors are under 30. The oldest is 44. Most of Fanpage’s unique visitors are in their 20s. Fanpage’s success is based on not just hiring young people, but also its ability to speak to them. From the beginning it invested heavily in its social media profile. Its YouTube community equals that of La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera combined, and it is also the only Italian news website with more than 500,000 TikTok followers. “Fanpage’s merit is that of having reached that vast demographic of young, disillusioned readers who didn’t follow the established dailies because they had no intention of reading the daily news,” said Anna Girardi, 27, the deputy political editor. “We knew that if we wanted to include them, we had to speak their language. Covering political or financial issues means having an awareness that there are readers who may have never heard some of the technical terminology.” Cancellato said: “Our main concern is never to grow old. We mustn’t make the mistake of growing old with our readers. We have no intention of taking over La Repubblica or Corriere. We’re Fanpage, we’re something else, and our desire is to change the way news is done in Italy.”",News/World news,Fanpage: the Italian website that went from gossip to award-winning scoops,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/10/fanpage-the-italian-website-that-went-from-gossip-to-award-winning-scoops
1/10/2022,"Each morning, from the moment when Joan Moliner unfolds his bicycle for the ride to work to Barcelona city centre, he is on a mission, one eye on the road, the other on builders’ skips. His quarry, if that’s the word, is cement floor tiles. All over the city, 19th-century apartment blocks are being made over into luxury flats. In the process, a vital part of Barcelona’s heritage – its decorative tiled floors – is ending up in a dump.  Conservation of the architectural heritage rarely extends beyond listing the facade, despite the wealth of interior detail in buildings erected at a time when Barcelona was a mecca for artists and artisans. “I see these old buildings as a conversation between all the different parts – the walls, the floors, all the details,” says Moliner. “Preserving the facade and nothing else doesn’t make much sense. It’s part of our evolution as a society that we’re throwing away.” Moliner, who when he gets off his bike at the end of his commute works as an employment adviser, picked up his first tile seven years ago. Stirred by the memory of the tiled floors in his parents’ house, he started collecting manufacturers’ catalogues and researching the history. Every tile tells a story, he says, surveying the 1,600 of them stacked up on his terrace. One such story is Antoni Gaudí’s Panot, a hexagonal tile featuring marine creatures manufactured by Escofet, Barcelona’s biggest tile company. It was originally intended for his Casa Batlló, but was eventually used on the floor of the Casa Milà on the nearby Passeig de Gràcia. In 1997, as a tribute to its most famous architect, the city relaid the elegant boulevard’s pavement with a reproduction of the Panot. The tiles Moliner collects came about thanks to the creation of cheap and versatile portland cement in the early 19th century by the Englishman Joseph Aspdin and were used to floor most of the buildings constructed in Barcelona from 1870 to 1950. Easier to lay, they did not need to be fired and could be produced by hand by a team of four artisans working a hydraulic press. Furthermore, they could be printed with any pattern, freeing artists from the rectilinear restraints of mosaic to produce the images of flora and fauna that are a trademark of modernisme, the distinctly Catalan version of art nouveau. “Escofet was one of the first manufacturers to employ artists to design the tiles,” says Moliner. The advent of the hydraulic cement tile coincided with a massive building boom in Barcelona, when it broke out of the confines of the medieval city to create the grid-like Eixample (Extension), where the Catalan bourgeoisie flaunted wealth that was often made off the back of slave labour in the textile and sugar industries. Moliner believes it’s important to conserve this part of the city’s heritage, even if the tiles can’t remain in situ. “There’s been talk for a long time about putting them in a museum, but nothing’s come of it so far.” He says he’s not interested in making money from his passion. However, he is hoping to collaborate with a centre for disabled people where they could refurbish, frame and perhaps sell the tiles. This article includes content provided by Instagram.

Meanwhile, he uses an app to recreate entire floor patterns based on the tiles he finds matched to catalogues and then puts them on Instagram at rajolesdebarcelona. “I got around 3,000 likes almost overnight so obviously it’s not just me who finds this interesting. “What I like is that it’s all handmade,” he says. “The tiles are handmade, they were laid by hand and then someone digs them up by hand and throws them out and I clean them by hand. I feel this connection with over a century of manual labour.”",News/World news,A man on a mission to preserve Barcelona’s decorative floor tiles,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/10/a-man-on-a-mission-to-preserve-barcelonas-decorative-floor-tiles
1/10/2022,"Pharmacists warn they may not be able to provide free rapid antigen tests to lower income Australians under the national concession card scheme because of supply issues, as the government says it won’t procure extra kits for businesses. The prime minister Scott Morrison on Monday said his government would not be distributing any rapid antigen testing kits to pharmacies as part of the concessional scheme, and that instead he expects chemists to source supplies themselves to meet the additional demand.  “They’ll come through the pharmacies and the pharmacy is responsible for securing their private supplies to meet that demand,” Morrison said. Details as to how the scheme will work are yet to be finalised, however it is understood pharmacies will be paid a fee per testing kit they give out under a payment system split evenly between the commonwealth and the local state or territory government. In the days since the scheme was agreed by national cabinet last Wednesday, pharmacies have come to realise they will be required to source the additional rapid antigen tests for concession card holders, but they are unclear as to how much they will be paid for each test. The free testing scheme will be run in contrast to how the vaccine rollout works, where providers order supplies from the government and don’t have to deal with commercial suppliers in the market. Patrick Carrig, who manages Carrig Chemists in Adelaide, is furious at the government. So far, Carrig has only placed one order for rapid tests – on Christmas Eve, just after the South Australian government announced they could be used in the state – and they are still yet to arrive. He is unsure of what demand will be like and is yet to place orders for the government’s free scheme for concession card holders because he wants to understand how much pharmacies will be paid per test and how long they must wait to receive the payment. “We are presumably meant to spend our days scrounging for the cheapest tests so that we can at least break even on the deal,” Carrig told Guardian Australia. “We are expected to source our own tests and then provide them at whatever the government is willing to pay.” Carrig warned that many pharmacies would not have sufficient cash flow to afford large orders of the tests only to give them out for free and wait potentially weeks to receive payment from the government. “They’re expensive. You’ve got to spend thousands of dollars. Not really sure what the price will be, what the government will pay you for each one.” Carrig said if the government did not change its position to also distribute the testing kits to chemists, some business owners may be forced to consider if they can take part in the scheme. “This puts us in a dubious ethical position. If the tests fall under the PBS (pharmaceutical benefits scheme), we’re not allowed to not supply them. But if it’s going to be a separate thing, well, not every pharmacy may be able to afford to do it,” he said. The owners of Bannockburn Pharmacy in Victoria are also concerned as to how they will source rapid tests for the scheme. “It came to our attention late Friday that the Federal Government WILL NOT be providing RATs DIRECTLY to pharmacies to give away for free to concessional card holders as per their announcement last Wednesday,” the pharmacy posted on its Facebook page. “Pharmacies were under the impression that the federal government would be allocating stock they have ordered directly to us pharmacies. “Instead we have been informed the Federal Government expect pharmacies to source their own RAT’s to give away to concessional card holders and then somehow the government will reimburse us to cover our cost of buying them. Pharmacies still haven’t been informed how this will occur,” the pharmacy said, calling on eligible customers who struggle to access a free RAT to contact their local MP.
