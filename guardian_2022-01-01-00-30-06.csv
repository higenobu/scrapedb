1/1/2022,"The FTSE 100 has recorded its best year since 2016, as UK stocks recovered from the pandemic shock of 2020. London’s leading index of blue-chip shares rallied by 14.3% during 2021, a year after falling 14.3% in its worst drop since the 2008 financial crisis. It closed at 7384 points on Friday, having started the year at 6460 points.  Stocks were lifted during the year by economic optimism as Covid-19 vaccines allowed economies to reopen, with stimulus packages from governments and central banks boosting growth. Investors largely shrugged off worries about inflation, ongoing supply chain disruption, and variants such as Omicron. The more domestically focused FTSE 250 index gained 14.6% over 2021 to end the year at 23,480 points, having hit a record high of 24,353 in September. Many other stock markets also rose strongly through the year, with the MSCI World index of global equities gaining 17%. Ashtead Group, the industrial equipment rental company, was the best-performing FTSE 100 stock. It rallied by 73%, after its revenues were boosted by the global economic rebound as major building sites reopened. Aerospace group Meggitt surged 58%, following a takeover approach from US rival Parker Hannifin that is being scrutinised by competition authorities. Mining company Glencore (+62%) was lifted by rallying commodity prices, while Royal Mail jumped 56% thanks to strong demand for parcel deliveries. Specialty chemicals producer Croda gained 53%, after a record performance including producing ingredients used in Covid-19 vaccines. Banks and oil companies also had strong years, but some of last year’s “pandemic winners” suffered, with Ocado falling 26%. IAG, British Airways’ parent company, fell 10% during 2021, on concerns that the travel recovery will be delayed by the Omicron variant. London lagged behind some other major European indices, with France’s CAC soaring 20% and Italy’s FTSE MIB up 23%. The pan-European Stoxx 600 hit a series of record highs, lifted by technology firms and financial stocks. Luxury also did well, with LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s shares firmly in fashion, up over 40%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 finished 2021 at its highest year-end level since 1989, rising almost 5% during the year. It is still about 25% below its record peak 32 years ago, before the Japanese stock market bubble burst. Wall Street led the way, lifted by major tech companies such as Alphabet which surged by around 66%. The S&P 500 index of US stocks rallied by 27% over the year, achieving 70 record closing highs, as corporate profits were lifted by higher consumer spending, and cash flooded into equity funds. “On the whole, 2021 has been an excellent year for equity returns,” says Richard Flax, chief investment officer at digital wealth manager Moneyfarm. “The second half of the year has seen a little more volatility than the first half – thanks largely to the Omicron variant causing uncertainty – but the likes of the US, Europe and Japan have seen strong growth.” Despite this year’s recovery, the FTSE 100 is still 6.5% below its peak of 7903 points set in May 2018, while the US, German and French markets all hit record highs this year. Oil prices rebounded by around 50% during 2021, lifted by higher demand and cautious production increases by the Opec group and its allies.

1/1/2022,"Robert Garry, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Tulane medical school in Louisiana, got a call from his university management telling him that agents from the FBI and CIA had requested a chat about his research into the origins of Covid-19.  Garry agreed and on 30 July three agents flew down to Louisiana to talk to him in person. The meeting, held at a university conference room, began at 9am and ended at about 5pm. “I presented my evidence to the agents, who were properly trained scientists themselves. They asked all the right questions,” Garry told the Guardian. “I told them: there is no way this virus could have been a manufactured weapon. There is also no evidence to suggest it was a lab leak. But I’m also conscious there are people out there who will always disagree.” Their conversation came two months after Joe Biden ordered US intelligence to investigate how the pandemic began. In normal circumstances, investigating an emerging infectious disease outbreak is a purely scientific inquiry, as was the case with Sars in 2003 and with Mers a decade later. But the search for the origin of the Covid pandemic has come in the middle of a global controversy that has mixed public health, domestic politics and international diplomacy. It has also coincided with the west’s growing distrust in the Chinese government and Beijing’s “wolf warrior” style of aggressive public diplomacy, which has resulted in many western capitals recalibrating their relationship with China. “It takes two to tango,” said Prof Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow in global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, a thinktank in New York. “At the beginning Beijing seemed to acquiesce to being the country of origin of the outbreak,” he said. Chinese officials seemed to acknowledge that the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan was where Sars-CoV-2 first emerged. “What happened after was that all kinds of wild theories began to pop up from both the US and China,” said Huang. Some of the those sprung up on Twitter. They included tweets from the Republican senator Tom Cotton on 30 January that linked the virus to a laboratory in Wuhan, and another on 12 March from the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, that promoted the theory that the US military brought coronavirus to Wuhan. “That’s how things began to go [in a] downward spiral,” said Huang. Despite the tit-for-tat rhetoric, there has been some progress. Almost a year after the pandemic was declared, a team of scientists from the World Health Organization was in January finally allowed to enter China to carry out an investigation. It was a politically charged mission from the start, with every single interaction between the scientists and the Chinese authorities heavily scrutinised by the world’s media. The team concluded it was “extremely unlikely” Covid had leaked from a lab and said the virus may have jumped from animals to humans. However, the WHO scientists presented little in the way of proof to dismiss the first hypothesis or back the second one after the trip. And the conclusion did not convince those who have long cast doubt on the WHO’s credibility. Referring to the investigation, Dr Alina Chan, a molecular biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard University, told a British parliamentary committee in December: “Let us be clear that this was not a scientific process.” She suggested the WHO had been incompetent in organising the investigation and was too credulous in trusting the Chinese authorities. Richard Horton, the editor-in-chief of the Lancet medical journal defended the organisation during the same hearing. “There was no silencing of the WHO; there was no silencing of the investigation team that went to Wuhan,” he said. The credibility of the investigation did seem to be dented by the fall from grace of the British scientist Dr Peter Daszak, a leading figure in the mission. In June, he was accused of conflict of interest owing, primarily, to his “close relationship” with the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the laboratory at the centre of the leak theory, and the person in charge of it, Dr Shi Zhengli – widely known as China’s “bat woman”. The plot thickened further in July, when the head of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, urged China to be transparent and said it was premature to rule out the lab-leak theory. A month later, the WHO said again that all theories on the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak were “on the table”, and urged Chinese scientists to carry out their own investigations. Later in August, the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a summary report that the investigation ordered by Biden in May was inconclusive about the virus’s origins. A full report was released in late October said the virus was not weaponised and was unlikely to have been genetically engineered, but the US intelligence community remained divided over its most probable origins. “All agencies assess that two hypotheses are plausible: natural exposure to an infected animal and a laboratory-associated incident,” the report said. China dismissed the report as “political and false”. Beijing has also threatened proponents of efforts to trace the origin of the virus from the start, with Australia among those to feel its displeasure. China regards the calls from the international community as “politicisation” of science, but critics say Beijing’s response has been just as political, if not more so. Others, including the US infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci think the way China responded is typical of how its vast bureaucracy deals with matters of this nature. “Even when they’re not hiding anything, they act that way,” he told the New York Times in June, referring to China’s initial response to the Sars outbreak in 2003. “Yet if you look at the way they acted early on, that’s the nature of the way the Chinese, when they have something that goes on in their own country, they just act in a very put-offish way. They’re not forthcoming with information. Does that mean that they’re really lying and hiding something? I don’t know,” Fauci said. In early October, the WHO announced it had assembled a group of 26 experts to revive the stalled inquiry into the origins of the pandemic. One senior official said it may be the “last chance to understand the origins of this virus” in a collegiate manner. Garry welcomed this development. He noted that despite the political rows, substantial progress had been made in the last few months. In September, for example, scientists found three viruses in bats in Laos were more similar to Sars-CoV-2 than any previously known ones. “This is a huge breakthrough, and adds further evidence to a nature origin hypothesis,” he said, adding that he was “100% certain” the Huanan seafood market was where the virus first emerged. “We are now seeing more evidence of that after investigations into stall owners, some of whom were believed to be selling wild animals such as raccoon dogs.” Huang said Garry’s interpretation was one of the many theories on which the global science community needed to reach a consensus. “But what’s unfortunate is that China and the west are entering an impasse. China is not forthcoming and the west does not trust China,” Huang said. “In the process of the tit for tat, the window of opportunity for scientists to find the real origin of the virus is closing. The state of affairs is making the origin-tracing even more difficult.”",News/World news,‘Tit for tat’: why hunt for Covid’s origins still mired in politics and controversy,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/31/why-hunt-for-covid-origins-still-wrapped-in-politics-impasse-china-west
1/1/2022,"For the past 20 years there have been a handful of constants in my life: my family, my best friend and Neighbours. Not neighbours like the people you borrow a cup of sugar from, but rather that sunshine-filled Australian soap you probably stopped watching once you left university. When I graduated, I carried on. First, out of habit (I needed to know the fate of Toadie’s mullet), but later for its nostalgic continuity and reassurance.  As my personal life began to get busier and more complicated, this saccharine and simple soap provided me with a 30-minute retreat every weekday, where my mind could empty as familiar faces filled the screen, offering up plotlines in which the moral good always prevails and the sun always shines. I hadn’t realised how committed I was to the show until we were thrust into lockdown. With my dad self-isolating on the other side of London and my brother in his own flat, I was alone. As the world outside spiralled, I turned to the TV for normality. Alan Fletcher, who plays Dr Karl Kennedy, began his stint on Neighbours only seven months after I was born. As I have grown up with the show, he has been a constant patriarchal presence, albeit one with multiple affairs, divorces and galahs. And throughout 2021, whether I was in lockdown or adapting to the uncertainty of London reopening, Dr Karl was a parasocial stand-in for the family I wasn’t able to see – and a man playing a character that got me through the loneliness and anxiety of 2021. “Neighbours is my happy place,” Fletcher says on a video call from his home in Melbourne in October, only hours before the city is due to come out of the world’s longest Covid-19 lockdown. “No matter what’s going on in my life, the minute I arrive at Neighbours I’m back in my bubble.” Neighbours only took a month off production in 2020 due to Covid and was one of the first shows to resume filming with a new Covid safety plan. It has been onscreen ever since. Such consistency has been as much a saving grace for Fletcher as it has been for viewers like me. “We know it’s really bad out there, but when we get to Neighbours, I’ve got my old friends in the cast and crew, and we focus on making joy and good drama because we know that people out there want to see it,” he says. Chuckling through his lockdown goatee, Fletcher seems genuinely honoured that he is the person that got me through this year. It turns out I’m not the only fan. “A lot of people have gotten in touch over the course of the pandemic to find out how I’ve been getting on,” he says. “They’ve also said how Neighbours helped to sustain them, which is really flattering.” As well as having Neighbours and his family to comfort him through 2021, Fletcher turned to another of his loves: music. A country and Americana aficionado, he was spurred on by the recent death of the singer-songwriter John Prine to take his craft more seriously. Under the tutelage of the musicians Lachlan Bryan and Damian Cafarella, he spent the year recording an album, due for release in 2022. “I think Covid has helped a lot of people to focus more on what’s important to them,” he says. “Those two guys really helped me and got me through 2021.” Country stardom notwithstanding, Neighbours is, thankfully, still Fletcher’s priority. “I have a lot of contact with my fans and it’s very sustaining to know that you’re part of a community,” he says. “Shows like Neighbours will always be there – it’s not like other dramas that come and go. I know that, at the end of the day, I can turn on the telly and that theme will play and we’ll be there for everyone.” As we continue to live in the flux of Covid, I will keep watching the show for its hammy storylines and soapy performances. After all, Neighbours should be there for one another.",Lifestyle/Life and style,The person who got me through 2021: Dr Karl Kennedy in Neighbours was strangely reassuring,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/31/the-person-who-got-me-through-2021-dr-karl-kennedy-in-neighbours-was-strangely-reassuring
1/1/2022,"The picture is a joyful one. Laure, a midwife at a health facility in Ndu, a village in the Democratic Republic of Congo, holds a healthy newborn girl. The baby’s mother, Ester, was at the health centre for a postnatal appointment after giving birth to twin daughters. A couple of weeks earlier, when she was heavily pregnant and due to go into labour at any moment, Ester was forced to leave her home in Bangassou, on the other side of a river, in the neighbouring Central African Republic.  In January, a coalition of armed groups attacked the city seeking to overturn December’s presidential vote, forcing thousands of people to flee their homes. When rebels moved on the capital Bangui, 10,000 refugees arrived on a single day in the Democratic Republic of Congo across the Ubangui River. Others went to Cameroon, Chad and the Republic of Congo. Ester and her eldest daughter, Princia, reached Ndu, about 4km (2.5 miles) away, where she went into labour. She sought medical attention from the village’s health facility but there were complications and she needed more specialist help, which was only available at the hospital in Bangassou. Mid-labour, she was taken on a canoe back across the river to Bangassou regional hospital, which has been supported by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) since 2014. There she had an emergency caesarean section to deliver the twins. Alexis Huguet, a French photojournalist who has been based in central Africa since 2017, was covering the humanitarian crisis along the border for Agence France-Presse and MSF. “When [people] fled in early January, they were really scared,” he remembers. “[The forces] attacked with heavy weapons. There was bombing in Bangassou. People heard the bombing and gunshots and ran to the river to cross to Congo. Some tried to find canoes, some swam. Some of them were pregnant. It was a mess, it was crazy.” This wasn’t the first time Huguet had been to Bangassou and Ndu. He was in the area covering a similar situation in 2017. “It was almost the same,” he says. “Back then, Bangassou was attacked by an armed group and tens of thousands of people had to flee their homes.” In 2018, the situation improved and people returned home, only for more unrest and conflict to unfold three years later. “It’s a symbol of what happened in Central African Republic over the last years. Authorities, with the support of donors, tried to rebuild the country. In a few weeks they lost almost everything,” says Huguet. He met some of the same people who fled three years before. “I asked what they were doing here. They told me they had to flee again because the situation deteriorated really quickly.” He saw them return to rebuild the former makeshift shelters that they had used three years before. He adds: “It was really sad.” When Huguet met Ester at her postnatal appointment, she told him that she hoped that the situation would calm down enough to return safely to Bangassou with Princia and the twins Rhode and Laure, named after the midwife who helped Ester. He has no idea where she and her daughters are now, or what they are doing.

1/1/2022,"With the pandemic, workers have been saying “I quit!” in their droves. In the US, employees packed in their jobs at such pace that a new term was coined – the Great Resignation – and alongside it, countless newspaper articles appeared about career-switching. But in the UK, are as many people quitting as we think? And would the greatest new year’s resolution be to join in? I asked Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies. Is the Great British Resignation under way?We’ve seen more people resign from their jobs than at any point before: it was roughly 400,000 in the three months from July to September 2021, up from 270,000 in the same period in 2019 – the last non-pandemic year. The UK has a dynamic labour market, with a high turnover, particularly in low-paying work. And when large parts of the economy reopened, more jobs were created.  What does this mean for the record-breaking 1m open vacancies we heard about last September?It means we’re now at 1.3m. Why can’t we fill all these vacancies?In the UK, we don’t have an unemployment crisis, we have a participation crisis. There are about a million fewer people in the labour market than there would have been had the previous trend of more people entering the labour market continued. That trend was partly driven by immigration, but also by having more women in work and an ageing population working for longer. Last year was the first time since the 90s that the workforce got smaller, partly due to people stopping work through ill health, but mainly as a result of older people retiring, particularly women. These people weren’t working during the pandemic, due to job loss or being furloughed, and thought: “I don’t want to go back to that. The conditions aren’t great.” So for all the headlines about young professionals leaving the rat race for a higher calling of luxury candles or whatever, it’s actually older people driving the seismic change? Pity, because I was enjoying blaming labour shortages on Brexit.We can’t blame all of it on that. Yes, we have a lot of low-paid and insecure work, but of the 4m jobs created in the past decade, more than 90% were in relatively high-skilled work. We’ve talked a lot about job creation and destruction. Is there such a thing as a job for life any more?If you want a job for life, then join the royal family. But it’s a pretty hard club to get into. Otherwise, no, there isn’t. You don’t sound fazed by that. What about the romance of “I’m a carpenter. My father was, too”?It’s an important issue. Many communities have been defined by industries, and there can be psychological scarring when their identities are disrupted, such as during the deindustrialisation of the 1980s and 90s. But throughout history, we have always dealt with massive changes, even when they have been imperceptibly slow. It is important we train people for the jobs that exist and the ones that don’t yet, and support people so that no one is left behind. It’s what we call inclusive growth. One last question, Tony – is this a good time to quit our jobs?It might be a good time to ask for that pay rise – telling your boss you’ve seen there are 1.3m vacancies, and that the Institute for Employment Studies says there are loads of high-skilled, well-paid jobs out there.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Should I quit my job?

1/1/2022,"Mikel Arteta has admitted frustration at being forced to watch Arsenal’s meeting with Manchester City in isolation as he recovers from Covid but is still hoping to have an influence from afar against the runaway Premier League leaders. With Arteta recovering after what he described as “a couple of rough days” with the virus, his assistant Albert Stuivenberg will take charge at the Emirates as Arsenal attempt to record their first Premier League victory over City since Pep Guardiola’s arrival in 2016. Who will be alongside the Dutchman, an assistant to Louis van Gaal at Manchester United and Ryan Giggs with Wales before joining Arsenal in 2019, remains uncertain given the large number of cases within the coaching staff.  Arteta will watch at home via a feed provided by the club but intends to leave most of the instructions to his trusted deputy. “I will need a big room so I can walk and move a little bit because I won’t be able to just sit on my sofa,” he said. “We will be in touch but as well I want to give them the responsibility and freedom to make decisions on the pitch and express themselves. It’s totally different being on the touchline close to the players and the action so I’m going to be there to support in certain moments but they have to get the momentum of the game and communicate with the players themselves.” Arteta added: “It’s not going to be easy – it will feel frustrating and like I have a lack of options. I haven’t been in training sessions or been able to prepare the players but we have to adapt to it.” The Arsenal manager – who confirmed that Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had been allowed to report early for Africa Cup of Nations duty with Gabon after being stripped of the captaincy – spent more than three years working under Guardiola at City as an assistant. He revealed that he had spoken with his compatriot on Thursday “because we have that relationship” and believes Arsenal have improved immeasurably since their 5-0 thrashing at the Etihad in August when Granit Xhaka was sent off in the first half. “It was a real challenge and we suffered,” said Arteta. “But sometimes that helps you to become a better team. You need to stick together to understand what the level is and the mistakes that you cannot make against this type of opposition. We know the opposition that we are facing but I’m focused on trying to compete in every moment. The most important thing is that we have the belief that we can go and win the game.”",Sport/Football,‘I will need a big room’: Arteta frustrated at having to watch Arsenal from afar,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/31/mikel-arteta-frustrated-watch-arsenal-from-afar-covid-albert-stuivenberg
1/1/2022,"With the release of Matt Reeves’ The Batman now just three months away, and the debut of yet another (this-time Catwoman-focused) trailer this week, we’re starting to get a pretty decent picture of how the new dark knight will return to multiplexes. Reeves promised us a vision of the caped crusader re-engaging with the traditional role of “world’s greatest detective” in which he’s often seen in the comics (not to mention the bravura 90s Batman: The Animated Series TV show), and it seems Bruce Wayne will be plunged into a Seven-esque race against time to stop Paul Dano’s Riddler from completing a murderous spree.  It’s a fascinating proposition for those of us who love the character first introduced by Bob Kane and Bill Finger in 1939 so much that we would happily sit through just about any Batman movie (provided it isn’t one in which our hero starts wielding guns and trying to take down Superman). The problem for Reeves is that he needs to do better than this. Why? Because Jon Watts’s Spider-Man trilogy has just shown everyone exactly how to bring back a superhero nobody was that impatient to see again. Only seven years ago, after the anticlimactic events of 2014’s The Amazing Spider-Man 2, the idea of the masked wallcrawler once again being top of the superhero tree for Christmas was almost impossible to imagine. After the events of Spider-Man: No Way Home, Peter Parker is the coolest thing in comic book movies since Samuel L Jackson was cast as Nick Fury. But Watts got pretty lucky. Peter Parker’s introduction to the Marvel Cinematic Universe via his startling cameo in 2016’s Captain America: Civil War allowed the film-maker to completely avoid the tired old Spidey origins story played out in Sam Raimi’s original 2002 Spider-Man and The Amazing Spider-Man. Spider-Man: Homecoming in 2017 then took advantage of the character’s newly confident position within the MCU by teaming him up with Robert Downey Jr’s Iron Man for what turned out to be an inspired, odd-couple pairing. Furthermore, Watts gave us a completely new take on Aunt May, banished both Spidey’s regular comic book squeezes (Mary Jane Watson and Gwen Stacy) and delivered a much sillier, far more charming and insouciant (not to mention suitably diverse) take on Midtown High School. The question now is quite how Reeves is going to freshen up Batman without having any of the same tools at his disposal. The film-maker has already confirmed that his take on Gotham’s dark knight will not be living in the DC extended universe, so is unlikely to ever meet Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman, Jason Momoa’s Aquaman or Ray Fisher’s Cyborg. Nobody will be taking bets just now on Ezra Miller’s The Flash showing up at some point, given his film, due in November, will dive deep into the DC multiverse and could theoretically end up meeting Adam West’s version of Bats if Warner Bros really feel like making it happen. But the chances are that this Robert Pattinson’s Gotham City will be one in which the caped crusader is going to be working on his own. So where exactly is the excuse going to come from for bringing Batman back for his sixth incarnation in three decades? It can’t just be that nobody could possibly be as bad in the cape and cowl as Ben Affleck, surely? A look at the latest trailer certainly suggests Dano’s Riddler will bear little resemblance to Jim Carrey’s irritating emerald-suited puzzler-poser. But will the challenge he presents to Bruce Wayne really be so different from the anarchic, unhinged threat of Heath Ledger’s Joker in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight? We’ve already witnessed Catwoman in two Batman live action movies, 1992’s Batman Returns and 2012’s The Dark Knight Rises, so how will Zoë Kravitz’s differ? She certainly has more feline-related japes up her sleeve than the relatively reserved Anne Hathaway in Nolan’s film, but are wisecracks about having nine lives really so different to Michelle Pfeiffer’s PVC-coated, pun-wielding turn all those years ago? For those of us who are Batman obsessives, these little details probably don’t matter. But for the wider cinemagoing public, Reeves will need to prove he’s giving us a Gotham City we haven’t seen many times before. Could the Riddler’s campaign against Batman be something to do with the sins of his father, as has been heavily hinted in previous trailers? Oops, we’ve already seen evil Thomas Wayne in the recent Joker. No doubt Reeves will find a fresh way to dig into the Wayne family’s past. He will certainly need to do so if The Batman is to escape the geek ghetto and find its way to the kind of wider audience that Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy secured. Let’s hope we’re in for some shocking Bat-twists – for despite what we hardcore caped crusader fanboys might like to think, there are only so many filmgoers ready to lap up new movies about Batman and Catwoman every few years, like bowls of increasingly tepid milk.",Arts/Film,Can Robert Pattinson’s The Batman defeat Tom Holland’s super-cool new Spider-Man?,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/31/can-robert-pattinsons-the-batman-defeat-a-rejuvenated-super-cool-spider-man-
1/1/2022,"Russia’s top diplomat has warned the west that its “aggressive” approach to Ukraine and threat of sanctions could force Moscow to “eliminate unacceptable threats to our security”, after a high-stakes conversation between Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden failed to deescalate the crisis. The remarks by the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, were published shortly after the Russian and US presidents held a 50-minute telephone call in which the two sides traded threats regarding tensions over Ukraine.  During the phone call, Biden told Putin that the US would impose serious sanctions on Moscow in the event that Russian forces, which include tanks, artillery and even short-range ballistic missiles, launched an attack on Ukrainian forces. Yuri Ushakov, a Kremlin aide, said Putin responded that fresh sanctions could lead to a “complete breakdown in ties between our countries”. “Our president also mentioned that it would be a mistake that our descendants would see as a huge error,” Ushakov told reporters late on Thursday evening. The US and other western countries have said Russia is massing military equipment on Ukraine’s border for what could be a potential invasion force. Thousands of Ukrainian civilians have taken part in combat training in preparation for a potential Russian assault, although the situation in the country is largely normal ahead of the new year holiday. Earlier this week, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security council, Oleksiy Danilov, said Kyiv was concerned about Russian troops on the border but added that there was no panic. He said: “As for the troop buildup near our borders reported by foreign media – we do not see that. There is a certain increase of [Russian] military and we closely monitor what’s happening at our borders.” Ukrainian military intelligence had previously warned of a massive buildup of Russian military equipment on the border and the potential of a large-scale Russian offensive by mid-January. Russian delegations are set to meet then with US, Nato, and Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) officials for a series of high-stakes talks on European security. Lavrov, in an interview with the news agency RIA Novosti, said Russia insisted on US and Nato military officials taking part in the negotiations next month. Moscow would not allow the talks to be dragged out by western nations, he said. “If there is no constructive response within a reasonable time and the west continues its aggressive line, then Russia will be forced to take all necessary measures to ensure strategic balance and eliminate unacceptable threats to our security,” Lavrov added. An analysis by the Conflict Intelligence Team, a group of bloggers and analysts who collect open-source intelligence on Russian military movements, showed that Russian military equipment had continued to arrive in the area to the north-east of Ukraine and to Crimea in the past month. The group concluded that “by the new year the concentration of vehicles near Ukraine’s borders and in Crimea has reached an unprecedented scale, most likely surpassing the April figures”. Russia held a massive buildup of troops earlier this year, leading to a summit between Putin and Biden in Geneva in June. However, Moscow is not yet ready to launch the operation, the group noted, adding that a limited strike on the Ukrainian military was more likely than a large-scale operation to seize and hold territory.",News/World news,Russian foreign minister warns west over ‘aggressive line’ in Ukraine crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/31/russian-foreign-minister-warns-west-us-ukraine-border-crisis
1/1/2022,"More than 6.5 million people in working families had no savings when the Covid pandemic began, analysis from Labour has shown, as the party warned a looming tax rise would hit those already hard up and mark a “miserable” start to 2022. According to the latest figures released by the government, many people had little or no money to fall back on just before the coronavirus struck.  There were 6,644,281 people in families where at least one adult was working who had no savings, the Labour analysis found, rising to 22,455,726 for those who had less than £1,500. The number of those whose savings only reached £3,000 was 26,680,605. However, there were 8,728,847 people who said their savings outstripped £20,000. The figures for those who declared no savings in 2019-20 were difficult to compare with the previous year, because the government had changed the definition of “no savings” in the latest set of data. The Department for Work and Pensions said it now counted those who declared “no savings” and those with less than £1,500 in the same category. With the energy price cap set to be raised next April and the rise in national insurance rise due to come into effect in April, the shadow work and pensions secretary, Jon Ashworth, claimed working families struggling to stay afloat faced a cost of living crisis – even before inflation. Seeking to blame people’s hardship on the government’s record, he said: “Eleven years of the Tories has seen family finances hammered and now it’s shaping up to be a miserable January with heating bills rocketing, prices going up and punishing tax rises on the way. This is a crisis made in Downing Street. “The simple truth is people are skint with little if any savings to fall back on. Ordinary working families shouldn’t be forced to pay the price for Boris Johnson’s economic failure.“Unlike the Conservatives, Labour wouldn’t be hitting working people with a tax hike, and as heating bills rise, we’d help ease the burden on households by cutting VAT on domestic energy bills now for the winter months” Ashworth said the problem would be exacerbated by a freeze in the income tax personal allowance, the universal credit uplift having ended and a rise in council taxes. A government spokesperson said: “We recognise people are facing pressures, which is why we’re taking £4.2bn of decisive action to help. “We are providing extensive support to those on the lowest incomes – including putting an average of £1,000 more per year into the pockets of working families on universal credit, increasing the minimum wage and helping with the cost of fuel bills. “Our £500m household support fund is also giving more help to the most vulnerable, and councils have been given an extra £65m to support low income households with rent arrears.”",Lifestyle/Money,"Millions with no savings hurt by Tory ‘failure’, says Labour",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/dec/31/millions-with-no-savings-tory-failure-says-labour
1/1/2022,"The number of NHS staff in England off work or isolating due to Covid has doubled over the last two weeks amid Omicron’s rapid spread, figures reveal. On Boxing Day, a total of 24,632 personnel in acute NHS trusts were absent because they were sick or quarantining as a direct result of either the Delta or Omicron variant.  That was more than double the 12,240 who could not work for that reason on Sunday 12 December and 31% up on the 18,829 recorded on the Sunday before Christmas, 19 December. The total number of NHS staff days lost because of Covid-related absence also increased sharply in the runup to the Christmas weekend – rising from 124,855 days in the week up until 19 December, to 176,914 in the seven days that ended on Boxing Day, the figures released on Friday show. The Liberal Democrats said that staff absence because of Covid at a time when the NHS is under such huge pressure was so worrying that Boris Johnson should convene a Cobra meeting to look into possible solutions. “Today’s figures confirm the worst: hospital and ambulance services are stretched to breaking point under the weight of devastating Covid staff absences, just as the government was warned”, said Daisy Cooper, the party’s health spokesperson. “It really is now or never for the government to get a handle on a crisis that is quickly spiralling beyond their control. Boris Johnson must call a Cobra meeting without delay to thrash out a comprehensive rescue plan.” The surge in staff sickness led Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, to warn that “the NHS is facing a perfect storm of Covid hospital admissions and illness rising at a very alarming rate alongside increasing numbers of frontline workers being off sick”. On Sunday, the Midlands had the largest number of staff off as a result of Covid (4,812), followed by London (4,580), the north-east and Yorkshire (4,179) and the north-west (3,966). NHS England’s latest “winter sitreps” data also showed that in all, 68,082 staff were off work at acute trusts on Boxing Day for sickness of any kind, which includes colds, flu and mental health problems as well as Covid. That was up 6% on the week before and 20% on two weeks earlier. Manchester University hospitals NHS trust had the most all-cause absences (2,407), followed by Sheffield teaching hospitals (2,093) and Nottingham University hospitals (1,982). Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, said the “worrying spike” in staff absence “is the biggest immediate challenge for trusts as they deal with the surge in micron cases together with continuing pressures on emergency care, urgent planned care that cannot be delayed any longer and the ongoing vaccination programme”. Taylor urged the public to behave responsibly, pointing to the 189,213 new cases of Covid across the UK and 2,082 new hospital admissions in England announced on Thursday. “While the government seems determined not to increase restrictions in England it is vital we all behave in ways that will not exacerbate an already dangerous situation”, he said. The British Medical Association renewed its plea to the prime minister to introduce new curbs in England to minimise Omicron’s impact, including cancellation of large social gatherings, limits on social mixing and reduced contact between households. “With Omicron now spreading so rapidly in the community, and daily cases nearing 200,000, the pressure this is placing on the NHS, through staff absences and rising hospitalisations, is becoming unsustainable”, said Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA’s chair of council. “Further public health measures are needed urgently to prevent the health service becoming completely overwhelmed, and today’s figures are further evidence why this is needed now”. Almost one in eight frontline ambulance staff in Wales are off sick or isolating because of Covid, with the numbers expected to continue to grow over the next week or so. Jason Killens, the chief executive of the Welsh ambulance services NHS trust, said that 322 people were off because of Covid – about 12% of frontline staff. Adding in “normal” sickness absenteeism, the number off rises to around 17%. Killens said: “We are starting to feel the pinch because of the absence rate. We are expecting that to grow over the next 10 days.” More armed services personnel are joining the ambulance service in January, bringing the number driving on the frontline up to around 250, with more doing backroom roles. Killens said the service had its highest numbers of referrals from the NHS 111 service on Monday and Tuesday. The pressure iwas increased by delays in patients being admitted, leading to queues of ambulances at hospital A&E departments. “We expect it to get very challenging in the next 10-14 days,” Killens said. “Some patients are waiting much longer than we would like.” Hopson added: “It will be particularly important in the coming days to look out for evidence of severe Covid-19 symptoms affecting older, vulnerable patients and impacting on critical care, as we saw earlier in the year. We haven’t seen that on a major scale yet but it still could arrive.” He and the BMA asked ministers to ensure that NHS staff have easy access to tests to diagnose if they have Covid or not amid ongoing shortages of both PCR and lateral flow tests. The BMA and Royal College of Nursing are also demanding that frontline personnel have access to the best possible personal protective equipment, including FFP3 masks.",News/Society,Number of NHS staff in England off due to Covid doubles in fortnight,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/31/number-of-nhs-hospital-staff-in-england-off-with-covid-doubles-in-month
1/1/2022,"Thousands of flights within the United States and internationally were delayed and hundreds were canceled early on New Year’s Eve, adding to the tally of delays and cancellations during the holiday week due to adverse weather conditions and rising cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant. Over 2,400 flights were canceled globally as of early Friday, including over 1,100 flights within the United States or entering or departing it, according to a running tally on flight-tracking website FlightAware.com. There were nearly 4,000 global flight delays in total.  The Christmas holidays are typically a peak time for air travel, but the rapid spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant has led to a sharp increase in Covid-19 infections, forcing airlines to cancel flights as pilots and crew need to be quarantined. The sudden arrival of Omicron has brought record-setting case counts to countries around the world. Transportation agencies across the United States are suspending or reducing service due to Covid-19 staff shortages as the Omicron variant surges nationwide. On Thursday, for the second day in a row, the United States had a record number of new reported cases based on the seven-day average, with more than 290,000 new infections reported each day, a Reuters tally showed, as US officials weigh the impact of the Omicron variant. US airline cabin crew, pilots and support staff are reluctant to work overtime during the holiday travel season despite offers of hefty financial incentives. Many workers fear contracting Covid-19 and do not welcome the prospect of dealing with unruly passengers, some airline unions have said. In the months preceding the holidays, airlines were wooing employees to ensure solid staffing, after furloughing or laying off thousands over the last 18 months as the pandemic crippled the industry.

1/1/2022,"The photographer Sabine Weiss, who has died aged 97, established her considerable reputation within the French “humanist” school of black-and-white photography, which aimed to capture the universal human experience through images of everyday street life. Images such as that of a horse kicking up its heels, tethered on snowy wasteland by the Paris flea market at the Porte de Vanves, or of a child illuminated only by a sparkler, are seen on a par with those created by her friends and near-contemporaries Willy Ronis, Brassaï, Izis Bidermanas and Robert Doisneau, the last of whom introduced her to his photo agency, Rapho, in 1952. Yet throughout her long career, Weiss worked across the medium, including in advertising, travel and journalism. She opened her studio on the Boulevard Murat in Paris in 1950, across from a fellow Swiss artist who had relocated to the city, Alberto Giacometti. Weiss always insisted that she was an artisan rather than an artist. Primarily, this was because, she said: “From the start I had to make a living from photography. It was never just about the art.” However, she demonstrated artistry even in advertising. Her images of products such as cognac and perfume explored themes of evanescence and flight: scent vaporises from a well; a centaur flees the flames of ignited brandy.  Weiss also documented avant-garde creatives, many of whom became her friends. In music they included Benjamin Britten, Stan Getz and Igor Stravinsky; in fine art, Jean Dubuffet, Fernand Léger, Robert Rauschenberg and Giacometti; the writers F Scott Fitzgerald, André Breton and Françoise Sagan; and actors such as Brigitte Bardot (whom she photographed in exceptional colour) and Jeanne Moreau. The Rapho agency became the perfect outlet for her photojournalism and personal work; she started as one of only two women working for them. Her stories were published in Vogue, Life, Paris Match and the New York Times magazine, and she was included in the Postwar European Photography exhibition (1953) at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. She participated in Edward Steichen’s groundbreaking exhibition The Family of Man, which began at MoMA in 1955 and toured for eight years to 38 different countries. Above all, Weiss loved photographing children, with whom she had a special rapport, as shown in the books Poussettes, Charrettes et Roulettes (2000), Intimes Convictions (1989) and Des Enfants (2000). Their capacity for play fascinated her, a favourite image being Enfants sur Arbre (Children in a Tree). Shot in 1951, it depicts three boys struggling to balance atop a thin wintry tree; a younger boy attempts to prop a metal bedstead against the spindly trunk. Born Sabine Weber in St-Gingolph, Switzerland, she fell in love with photography early, buying her first Bakelite camera with her pocket money at the age of eight, and “printing” her images by exposing contact sheets to sunlight on her windowsill. Her first mentor was her father, a chemical engineer, who gave her, she told me in an interview for the Independent in 1987, “a very practical liking for the subject”, which was “something of a salvation as I was always more visual than intellectual”. The Weber family moved to Geneva and, aged 15, Sabine took the first opportunity to exchange formal schooling for a photography apprenticeship with the 80-year-old François-Frédéric Boissonnas. Boissonnas, whose family had owned a photo-studio almost since the camera’s invention, taught her composition, and encouraged stylistic experimentation. In Geneva, Sabine came to know members of a French-Jewish community in exile from nazism. When survivors returned to Paris in 1946, she made her home there too. A contact introduced her to the fashion photographer Willy Maywald, whose studio assistant she became: “I worked in conditions unimaginable today – no water or telephone – but with him I understood the importance of natural light. Natural light as a source of emotion.” She remained with him for four years, using his studio to devise commercial jobs and his darkroom to start developing her own work. Fashion gave her access to “le tout Paris”, including Christian Dior’s 1947 launch of his New Look. In 1949 she met the American painter Hugh Weiss, who encouraged her in the use of colour. Then, too, her fascination with line and form emerged, both in visually framing her images and in the rearrangements that could be subsequently achieved with the application of darkroom processes. They married in 1950, and adopted a daughter, Marion. Weiss recalled it as a happy period, personally and creatively, when “a kind of national optimism” overcame the humiliation caused by the German occupation. That year she also began working with the Armenian-Egyptian-French photographer Alban, travelling between studios in Brussels and Cairo, where the light inspired her to properly begin working in colour. During this time she published a mix of reportage and travel features from around the world in Vogue, Life, Holiday, Time and Picture Post. Across a further 60-plus years of photographic work, Weiss’s international reputation steadily grew. More than 40 books and exhibition catalogues document her diverse interests, from grassroots theatre companies to artists’ monographs; Paris street markets and fairs to rural musicians; country profiles from Bulgaria to Burkina Faso. In 2017, she donated her entire archive to the Musée de l’Ēlysée in Lausanne. In 2020, she won Kering’s Women in Motion photography award. When I interviewed her, I met a warm, conversational woman, happily at home in the same studio that she had moved into when it was a hovel without electricity or an indoor toilet. Recalling how she was so poor that she traded her portraits for vegetables on the local market, Weiss still looked back with gratitude and affection. She said it was the people she came to know through her photography that pleased her most, “whether on street markets, in famous galleries, or working at Printemps”. Yet when I asked why she thought her most-reproduced non-commercial image was of the horse bucking itself free of its tether, she said: “That one, to me, is a portrait of solitude. My world, as a photographer, has to be about loneliness. And so it is I’ve learned to love solitude as well as all the rest.” Hugh died in 2007. Weiss is survived by Marion.
