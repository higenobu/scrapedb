4/4/2022,"""Putin is at war not with Ukraine. He's at war with the United States and NATO,"" Mikhail Khodorkovsky told CNN. The exiled oligarch said propagandists have ""already been started to prepare Russian society for an attack on NATO countries."" If Putin decides he has won in Ukraine, he will prepare to invade the Baltic countries, Khodorkovsky said. Exiled Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky said in an interview with CNN Sunday that the next step in Vladimir Putin's war may be the invasion of the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. ""We must understand that, in his head, Putin is at war not with Ukraine. He's at war with the United States and NATO,"" Khodorkovsky said. ""He said this more than once."" Khodorkovsky, a former oil tycoon, was considered the wealthiest man in Russia until 2003 when, for what he says were political reasons, Putin charged him with financial crimes and imprisoned him for nine years. Since Khodorkovsky's release in 2013, he has been an outspoken critic of the Kremlin and Putin's regime. ""His propagandists have already been started to prepare Russian society for an attack on NATO countries. They're constantly talking about this,"" Khodorkovsky said. ""And this is the preparation of Russian public opinion for this."" Earlier this month, Khodorkovsky predicted the invasion of Ukraine would end Putin's regime. However, in his Sunday interview with Fareed Zakaria, he expressed concern that Putin went ""insane"" when Ukrainians resisted the invasion and that the attacks could escalate. ""I'm absolutely convinced that, if Putin decides that he has won in Ukraine, this is not going to be the last step, the last war,"" Khodorkovsky said. ""The next steps will be the Baltic countries."" The Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are all members of NATO. President Joe Biden has previously said the US will ""defend every inch of NATO territory"" and has moved American troops into the region.

4/4/2022,"This story contains graphic descriptions and images Macabre new details have emerged about the Russian rampage through Ukraine, where Vladimir Putin’s forces are accused of indiscriminately killing civilians. A survivor named Igor told The Insider one woman who was making food on the street was killed when she went inside as Russian soldiers walked by. “They opened fire on her with an automatic rifle—they killed her right through the door,” Igor said. “I don’t know with whom they are fighting.” Ukraine’s defense ministry tweeted horrific photos showing dead naked women, some of whom had been burned, along a road in Bucha, outside of Kyiv. Mass graves and corpses with gunshot wounds were also left behind. A man gestures at a mass grave in the town of Bucha. Satellite images of Bucha show an approximately 45-foot-long trench dug around the grounds of the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints, according to satellite imagery that Maxar Technologies, a space technology company, shared with The Daily Beast. The images were captured March 31. Satellite image captured March 31. The carnage was a backdrop to a Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s declaration that Moscow is bent on “genocide” and a Human Rights Watch report detailing alleged war crimes by Russian soldiers. Despite the shocking images and global outcry, Russia continued to pound Ukraine this weekend. Thick black smoke was seen billowing over the once-picturesque port of Odessa on Sunday morning after Russian strikes obliterated a fuel depot in the city that had previously see little fighting since the Russian invasion on Feb. 24. Both Russian and Ukrainian military confirmed the hit on their Telegram channels. “This morning, high-precision sea and air-based missiles destroyed an oil refinery and three storage facilities for fuel and lubricants near the city of Odessa, from which fuel was supplied to the group of Ukrainian troops in the Mykolaiv direction,” the Russian military said in a statement on Telegram. Smoke rises after an attack by the Russian army in Odessa. Odessa Mayor Hennadii Trukhanov confirmed the hit and said no one had died. “Today the occupiers struck Odessa’s critical infrastructure objects with missiles,” he said on a televised statement that ran on Ukrainian media channels, according to CNN. “There’s fire, there’s smoke. Luckily, there are no casualties. Only buildings are damaged. The situation is under control.” As Russian troops continue to retreat, regroup and restock, they have left a macabre trail in their wake. Ukraine’s defense ministry tweeted horrific photos showing dead naked women, some of whom had been burned, along a road outside of Kyiv where Russian troops had been stationed. Mass graves and corpses with gunshot wounds shot at point blank range were also left behind. The war, now entering its second month, shows no sign ending soon, in part thanks to Ukraine’s fierce resistance, backed by Western donations of money, war machinery, and ammunition. On Sunday, the U.K. Defense ministry applauded Ukrainian efforts, saying they had greatly hindered Russian air capability. “Russia’s inability to find and destroy air defence systems has seriously hampered their efforts to gain broad control of the air, which in turn has significantly affected their ability to support the advance of their ground forces on a number of fronts,” they tweeted. The body of a man, with his wrists tied behind his back, lies on a street in Bucha. Still, no one has claimed responsibility for a strike on a fuel depot in Belogrod, on Russian territory, after Russian military blamed Ukraine for what would be the first cross-border offensive if confirmed. On Sunday, Ukraine added to their gains, reclaiming the ghost town of Pripyat, which has been abandoned since the 1986 meltdown of Chernobyl nearby, which Russian troops claimed early on. “Today, April 3, units of paratroopers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine took control of the area of the city of Pripyat and the area along the State Border of Ukraine with the Republic of Belarus,” Ukrainian military said in a Facebook post that included a photo of the Ukrainian flag flying overhead. —Shannon Vavra contributed reporting.

4/4/2022,"Four teachers have resigned from North Joshua Elementary school after they made students, who had home-packed meals, use their school lunch card to get food from the cafeteria and then give it to certain teachers to eat, the school district said in a social media statement. Joshua Independent School District said this year its students had the option for free lunches under the National School Lunch Program to assist families affected by COVID-19 or food insecurity. Four teachers admitted to abusing the program by telling students with packed lunches to use their lunch card, go through the lunch line and get a free lunch for staff members. “This practice occurred consistently throughout the school year and was captured on District security cameras,” Joshua ISD said. “The teachers then voluntarily and of their own volition admitted to this behavior and resigned from employment. Not one teacher chose to fight potential termination, but again, admitted guilt, and voluntarily resigned.” The school district issued its statement to clear rumors that the staff members were fired. “The district denies all inflammatory allegations and any suggestion that the district took any actions contrary to state or federal law. These claims are baseless and entirely without merit,” the statement read, adding that “there is more to this matter.” After meeting with the staff members involved, the school district is also considering future legal steps. “While many in the community have stated the students were performing ‘an act of kindness’ and that this was one mistake which should not merit a separation of employment, such is not the case,” Joshua ISD said. “The act of receiving federal free lunches which one is not entitled to is fraudulent behavior, abuse of official capacity, and theft of federal funds, carrying with it criminal sanctions.” The school district added that the incident can cause it to lose federal funding beyond the lunch program, and that the superintendent will report to the State Board of Educator Certification because of evidence of educators who “illegally transferred, appropriated, or expended school property or funds.” “Joshua ISD assures its community that no students are to blame for this matter, rather only the staff members,” the statement read.",U.S./Fort Worth Star-Telegram,Four teachers at a Joshua school quit after admitting abuse of free lunch program,https://news.yahoo.com/four-teachers-joshua-school-quit-154113893.html
4/4/2022,"After 8 years in jail with no conviction, Emmanuel Fair is finally free. In 2008, Fair was named as the lead suspect in a murder case following a party that ended in the sexual assault and strangulation of a 24 year old Indian woman named Arpana Jinaga. Jinaga was one of several hosts of a Halloween party that took place between several apartments, including her own, in the Valley View Apartment complex located in Redmond City, Seattle. Following the murder, local authorities zeroed in on Fair due to him being the only Black man at the party, and his past criminal record. According to reporting by Rolling Stone “based on more than a thousand pages of case files and legal documents,” Fair was arrested in 2010, and was housed in the King County jail for eight years, seven months, and 14 days without ever being convicted of a crime. “I’ve never seen a worse case,” says Corinne Sebren, one of Fair’s lawyers. “There’s very little justice left to salvage.” Read more &#39;You Got McDonald&#39;s Money?&#39; and Other Phrases We Remember From Childhood &lt;i&gt;Black in the Day&lt;/i&gt;: Barrettes, Blue Magic and Other Ways We Laid Our Hair Cheat Sheet: What is Critical Race Theory? Toasted: Jerk Chicken Empanadas and Mango Chili Sauce But Fair is going after it all, suing everyone responsible for keeping him wrongfully imprisoned for so long. Fair filed a lawsuit against the county, the city of Redmond, and the Redmond Police Department. Fair also filed a lawsuit against Detective Coats, the lead detective on the case who after reviewing photos from the party and noticing that Fair was the only Black man present, said he looked like “an outsider” and seemed to have it out for him from the very beginning. Fair’s lawsuit claims the detectives on the case “ignored and failed to gather evidence that did not align with their theory of the case,” and almost nine years later, he was released. This past week, his legal team also filed a new complaint. The suit contends that if Fair had not been a Black man, he would have never ended up in jail, and certainly not for the length of time he was imprisoned. According to Rolling Stone, the investigation was described as being, “so badly handled it can only be characterized as bizarre.” From racial discrimination to insufficent evidence, to calling in a psychic medium, Fair was wrapped in a circus that kept him locked up for years, robbing him of his youth and a chance to be a thriving member of his community and society at large. Now at 38, Fair is attempting to start life anew, and lives in his aunt and uncle’s home Seattle’s Central District. He now faces the same issues most Black men face once released, whether or not their arrest and imprisonment was just; difficulty finding employment, housing, and financial instability. “I’m out,” Fair says, “but I’m not free.”",U.S./The Root,"After A Wrongful Conviction, One Black Man Is Suing Everyone Involved In His 8 Year Incarceration",https://news.yahoo.com/wrongful-conviction-one-black-man-164500791.html
