1/16/2022,"The game had entered the 87th minute when Eddie Howe bellowed a command from the technical area. “Relax,” screamed Newcastle’s manager as his team failed to retain possession. With hindsight “concentrate” might have been the better word as, within seconds, João Pedro had headed Watford’s late equaliser and it seemed Howe’s players had taken him too literally.  In fairness to Jamaal Lascelles and his fellow defenders the preceding cross from substitute Kiko Femenia was world class but João Pedro reacted first hurling himself at the ball and prompting a heartfelt roar of relief from Claudio Ranieri as it hit the back of Martin Dúbravka’s net. Until then it had seemed that, thanks to Allan Saint-Maximin’s wonderful individual goal, Newcastle were about to register a second win of the season while clambering out of the bottom three but Howe’s side were never remotely convincing and Watford deserved what is, incredibly, only their second draw of the campaign. It arrested a run of seven straight defeats for Ranieri’s team – who now travel to Burnley on Tuesday and entertain Norwich on Friday – and keeps them 17th, two points and two places ahead of Newcastle. Ranieri gave debuts to his three new January signings, the former Nice left back, Hassane Kamara, the ex Udinese centre half Samir and Edo Kambeye, a midfielder acquired from Eupen. Samir swiftly found himself hurled in the deep end, marking Chris Wood, Eddie Howe’s own £25m new boy. The Brazilian defender started well but, even so, Wood swiftly showed off his ability, the former Burnley centre forward serving as a decoy, dragging two defenders out of position and permitting Joelinton to flick the fallout from Ryan Fraser’s whipped in cross against the bar. When Jamaal Lascelles subsequently nodded Kieran Trippier’s corner into his path, Wood might have scored but instead headed fractionally off target. At this juncture, Newcastle dominated possession but did not do too much with it. Far too many of their final balls were snatched and this rather rushed approached offered a deep sitting Watford cause for mild optimism. Ranieri was bolstered by the return of his leading scorer Emmanuel Dennis but, initially, the Nigerian forward struggled wide on the right where he was offered precious little room for manoeuvre by Paul Dummett. Back at left back after missing the first half of the season through injury, the latterly much-missed Dummett offered Newcastle reassuring stability but when, partway though the first half, Dennis switched flanks he very quickly made life tough for Kieran Trippier. Dennis’s ability to dodge the England right back – hitherto an attacking force down Newcastle’s right – highlighted Watford’s, albeit sporadic, counter-attacking threat. At their best Ranieri’s players zipped the ball around with menacing rapidity but, all too often, the gifted, if frequently infuriating, João Pedro flattered to deceive. Watford’s only consolation was that Allan Saint-Maximin, Howe’s own mercurial game changer, was, in the first half at least, below his best and, once on the ball, tended to flicker rather than flare into life. Perhaps Saint-Maximin was merely lulling the visitors into a false sense of security. Or perhaps he did not properly wake up until the 49th minute but suddenly the French winger was dispossessing Jeremy Ngakia before swerving past two more defenders as he accelerated into the box and ultimately sent a left foot shot curving inexorably away from Ben Foster’s reach. When, very shortly afterwards, Moussa Sissoko sent Saint-Maximin crashing, painfully, to earth with an accidentally on purpose reckless tackle it seemed to symbolise Watford’s collective frustration. As Sissoko – an unloved figure by the end of his stay here a few years ago – was roundly booed by his former public. Josh King, once one of Howe’s Bournemouth players, very nearly ruined his old boss’s mood, after bisecting Newcastle’s backline and leaving himself with only Martin Dúbravka to beat but King’s first touch let him down, enabling Dúbravka to make a vital, and potentially season-defining save. The Slovakia goalkeeper reacted smartly but Ranieri’s crestfallen expression confirmed it was a big opportunity missed. Watford though refused to surrender and an almost palpable edginess continued to pervade the bulk of the 52,223 crowd, with the tension, at times, almost unbearable. When Lascelles made a horrible error, miscueing what should have been a routine square pass and Dennis played in an unmarked Sissoko, St James’ Park held its collective breath but the France midfielder shot narrowly wide and Lascelles looked mighty relieved. Femenia and Pedro would eventually wreck his weekend but Watford’s lack of celebration at the final whistle offered confirmation that they, like Newcastle, remain in real relegation peril.",Sport/Football,Watford’s João Pedro strikes late to dash Newcastle’s hopes of vital win,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/15/newcastle-watford-premier-league-match-report
1/16/2022,"Bruno Lage recently misunderstood a question about Europe as an enquiry about his plans for a mid-season warm-weather training camp but there was no mistaking what the Wolves fans were singing about as they dispatched Southampton to rise to eighth in the Premier League. The substitute Adama Traoré completed the scoring, a couple of minutes after Romain Perraud headed against the upright in search of a Southampton equaliser. Wolves looked comfortable but it turned into a grandstand finish after James Ward-Prowse leathered a late swerving free-kick in from 30 yards.  These are two managers with little sympathy for their rivals submitting postponement requests to the Premier League. Ralph Hasenhüttl has been critical of the league for allowing clubs perceived wriggle room to delay games to suit themselves and a look at the Wolves lineup reflected the lengths they have gone to ensure they have adequate numbers to fulfil their fixtures during a strained period. Without Romain Saïss, who has captained Morocco to the knockout stages of the Africa Cup of Nations, and Ruben Neves after he returned a positive Covid test, Lage shuffled his pack and handed the 22-year-old Toti Gomes a debut in defence, one of three players recalled from loans this month in order to bolster a thin Wolves squad. The Wolves head coach also named two goalkeepers and three teenagers among his substitutes. Wolves were determined to foster further momentum after starting the year with an impressive victory at Manchester United and breezing into the FA Cup fourth round here last weekend. Southampton arrived fresh from beating Brentford in midweek and despite making a promising start they were on the back foot when Jimenez sent Fraser Forster the wrong way from the penalty spot. Jan Bednarek made a cumbersome challenge on Rayan Ait-Nouri inside the box and, despite initially awarding a corner, the referee, Michael Salisbury, changed his verdict after visiting the VAR monitor. Hasenhuttl was still cussing a couple of minutes later, shaking his head on the touchline. Southampton came close to an equaliser before the interval but the Wolves goalkeeper Jose Sá twice saved from the head of Mohammed Salisu. Oriol Romeu scooped a cross towards the back post and Salisu made clean contact but Sá scrambled to his right to repel his header and, in first-half stoppage time, Salisu again threatened in the air, meeting Ward-Prowse’s corner and nodding at goal, only for Sá to tip his effort over. Hasenhüttl crashed back in his chair in disbelief and then it was Wolves’ turn to bemoan the messy officiating, with the referee blowing for half-time just as Joao Moutinho telegraphed a wonderful ball behind the Saints defence. Hasenhuttl stuck with the same team and system that started on Tuesday to match up Wolves’ three-man defence, but reverted to his favoured 4-2-2-2 formation at the interval, with the striker Che Adams replacing Ibrahima Diallo. But Southampton lacked the thrust that saw them score four against Brentford and failed to break down a notoriously trusty, if different, Wolves back line. Wolves had no such problems and had Forster to thank when they doubled their lead approaching the hour. Aït-Nouri sent a free-kick towards the back post and Forster wandered out of goal to meet the ball, only to halt his run halfway. Max Kilman did not think twice and sent a header looping over Forster and against a post. The rebound was there for taking and Coady obliged. Ward-Prowse rattled in from distance to tee up a tantalising finish but it was Wolves who had the final say.",Sport/Football,Traoré clinches win over Southampton as Wolves maintain push for Europe,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/15/wolves-southampton-premier-league-match-report
1/16/2022,"The video was, according to former Ukip leader Henry Bolton, evidence of the declining quality of MPs. Anthony Grayling, the philosopher, described her as a “bald-faced emetic” and Philip Pullman, the author, said he was “aghast”. Their collective outrage was directed at the words of Rosie Holt who, asked by an interviewer whether she attended any of the Downing Street parties, said that until Sue Gray completes her report “your guess is as good as mine: I don’t know whether I attended the party”.  Holt added: “If there was a party in lockdown when we told everyone they couldn’t even attend funerals, but no one knew about it, was there a party?” At a glance, Holt may be hard to distinguish from the declining number of Tory MPs prepared to stand up for the prime minister, but she is in fact a satirist – an actor and comedian with a strong line in parodies of the political speech that veers into drivel. This video sketch has taken off – 6 million views on Twitter so far – partly because “an awful lot of people” think it’s real, she said. “I don’t go in there to hoodwink people,” she told the Observer. “I get a bit unnerved when lots of people think it’s real because that’s not what I’m trying to do. “But there’s also an awful lot of people who do get it. And I’m quite good at screening out the negative stuff. Some people say ‘oh, you shouldn’t joke about things like this – it’s a serious subject’. “But I’m a big believer in laughing at things that make you sad and angry. And there’s so many things happening with this government at the moment there is always just so much material.” This particular video was created by splicing Holt’s footage with questions from a Sky News reporter to Boris Johnson in which he dodged questions about whether he had gone to the 20 May 2020 garden party. Others have featured Holt as a disingenuous columnist or online commentator, putting forward arguments about issues such as Shamima Begum or the Edward Colston statue. Social media has been flooded with jokes and memes since partygate began. After Johnson’s claim that he “believed implicitly that it was a work event”, people posted pictures of other “work events”: people dancing at festivals, in bars, at pool parties, and England football fans lighting flares between their buttocks. When news emerged that Downing Street staff had taken a suitcase to a supermarket to fill it with booze, supermarket wine shelves were Photoshopped under an “office supplies” notice. Holt’s first sketch appeared in June 2020 during the Black Lives Matter protests. The 30-something actor, who trained at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, had been about to go on tour in The Crown – Live, a parody of the Netflix series, when the first lockdown began. “I moved back with my parents for lockdown one in Somerset and, like a lot of creators, was going a bit mad,” she says. Her first video was prompted by comments by people outraged that Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, planned to remove a statue of slaveholder Robert Milligan from outside the Museum of London Docklands. “All these people were saying ‘you’re trying to destroy history’, ‘this is against democracy’. There was so much rage. It was extraordinary – this visceral reaction of people wanting to protect the statues of slave traders. I had the idea of taking someone who is following those ideas through to their logical conclusion. So I put up a sketch where this character says, ‘oh, it’s terrible, they’re erasing history. Just like Stalin did. Who, incidentally, I have a statue of in my garden’.” Another video about Colston features Holt’s rightwing commentator asking if things have gone too far – will people start demonising men from the past for beating their wives, for burning witches or for Victorian child labour? Holt was nervous about her early videos, and did detailed research on the news to make sure she didn’t make mistakes. “When I started reading the Telegraph and [online magazine] Spiked, they’ll put forward an argument while omitting huge gaps. One issue that keeps getting put forward again and again is that ‘slavery was all right, everyone was doing it’ but there was still a really strong abolitionist movement. They put forward these really strong opinions without evidence to back them up any more, and I find that quite worrying.” Holt’s agent, Hatch Talent, is negotiating various offers that have come her way. Why does she think things have taken off for her now? “I think people are really angry about the parties. So it has hit a nerve,” she says. “I find this government in general quite abhorrent. And I think the problem is that when Boris came to power, he seemed to prize loyalty over competence. So he got rid of a lot of the competent Tories. “And as a result, you’ve got this cabinet of people who are largely, well, morons, really. They are incompetent morons. And so, if Boris does go, who are we going to get instead? Liz Truss? Oh God. How awful.”",Arts/Culture,Rosie Holt: the satirist whose ‘Tory MP’ video had so many fooled ,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/15/rosie-holt-the-satirist-whose-tory-mp-video-had-so-many-fooled
1/16/2022,"Rafael Benítez’s job as Everton manager was under increasing pressure on Saturday night as Norwich recorded just a third win of the season over his Everton side at Carrow Road. An own goal from Michael Keane and a cute finish from the impressive Adam Idah in the first half were enough to claim three vital points for Dean Smith’s side in the battle against relegation. A frenetic and furious Benítez, meanwhile, was left looking over his shoulder as the travelling support unfurled banners calling for his departure and that of the Everton board at full time.  Norwich deserved their win as they showed composure and a level of quality that has almost been entirely lacking so far this season. The visitors, meanwhile, recorded a decent second-half display and halved the deficit with a goal from substitute Richarlison. But in the round there was not enough on display and Everton are now just six points off the drop zone themselves. Norwich began the game the stronger as they dominated possession and looked confident on the ball despite having lost six Premier League games on the spin. That they did not look particularly dangerous in front of goal would not have surprised many, those six games were scoreless too, but the Canaries were able to rely on generosity from their opponents to open the scoring when Keane turned into his own net. It came in the 16th minute after a long spell of possession ended up at the feet of Josh Sargent at the right side of the Everton byline. The American has had a torrid time in front of goal this season but on this occasion delivered quality: he moved beyond Vitalii Mykolenko and found a low cross that spelled danger in the six-yard box. Idah was interested and it was the Irishman that Keane sought to cut off, but his toepoke onto the ball was all wrong and shot past Jordan Pickford into the net. Norwich doubled their lead straight from kick off. Anthony Gordon surrendered possession in the Norwich third, but the home side broke with purpose through Brandon Williams down the left. Dean Smith has praised the Manchester United loanee for his character in Norwich’s fight against relegation but here it was first pace, then precision, that counted as he played Idah in behind a retreating Everton backline. Idah’s first touch was off but his second was cute and he curled a shot beyond Pickford for his first Premier League goal of his career. Faced with a real deficit, Everton were woken from their slumbers, or perhaps it was the pitch invader, flicking his fingers at Benítez and getting applause from the visiting fans, that did it. Either way their intensity rose for the remainder of the first half, without having much in the way of chances to show for it. Benítez waited till 10 minutes in the second half to change things up, moments after Idah almost had a third after a calamitous backpass from Mykolenko. Yerry Mina and Richarlison came on for Seamus Coleman and Salomon Rondon and within five minutes the substitutes combined to bring Everton back into the game. It came from a corner, Tim Krul struggled to clear after he entered a melee in the box. The ball was whipped back in and Mina put the Norwich goalkeeper under pressure again. Krul’s punch was weak, it did not clear his area, and Richarlison – the blond Brazilian returning to the side for the first time since 12 December latched onto it to sweep a perfect overhead kick into the net. Now Everton had a spring in their step, and their passing clicked for the first time in the match. But Norwich, customarily unused to leading a Premier League football match, managed the game well . As the clock ticked down Everton could count just one half chance, a low effort from Gordon that was blocked by substitute Dimitris Giannoulis. Seven minutes of added time were held up and Benítez was up and down from his seat as Smith prowled the technical area. Idah had another chance on the break that Mina blocked and Milot Rashica hit the post with the last kick of the match.",Sport/Football,Adam Idah seals Norwich win to pile pressure on woeful Everton and Benítez,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/15/norwich-everton-premier-league-match-report
1/16/2022,"Doctors at Tigray’s main hospital are urging the Ethiopian government to allow supplies of insulin to be airlifted into the region, warning that their stocks will run out within a week and that patients with type 1 diabetes are “at serious risk of death”. At the Ayder referral hospital in Mekelle, the largest in the region of 7 million people, staff have been told they only have 150 vials of insulin left and no oral diabetes medicines, according to a statement late on Friday.  “This very limited amount will only allow us to serve our patients in need for less than a week,” warns the statement, published on the website of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and signed by a group of experts, some of Tigrayan origin. The stark warning is a further sign of the intense strain placed on the region’s healthcare services by the 14-month conflict between Tigrayan and federal government forces, which has been marked by widespread human rights abuses and deepening humanitarian strife. If left unresolved, doctors fear the insulin crisis could affect thousands of people. More than 6,000 people were being treated for type 1 diabetes throughout the region before the war began, about 2,500 of them at Ayder. The Observer has not been able to independently verify the claims. The UN accuses prime minister Abiy Ahmed of maintaining a de facto blockade on the region to deprive it of basic resources including food, fuel and medical supplies. The government denies this, saying forces loyal to the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) have disrupted supplies by attacking critical infrastructure and seizing aid trucks. “In conflicts there are always many wrongs, often on both sides, but we feel denying medical care to innocent civilians under any circumstances is unethical. We appeal to healthcare professionals around the world … to help avert this blockage of critically important, life-saving medicines,” says the statement to the IDF. “In 2022, 100 years after the discovery of insulin, please let us not deliberately sentence our type 1 diabetes population to inevitable and agonising death through collective inaction.” Doctors at Ayder have not received any diabetes medicine from the government in Addis Ababa since July and have been using expired medicines since September, the statement says. Now even those supplies are dwindling, it adds. “A diabetes catastrophe is … unfolding as people with type 1 diabetes cannot live without insulin,” warn the doctors. The hospital has also run out of IV fluids, they add, forcing them to treat patients with acute diabetic complications with just water. This is “extremely difficult because of co-existent nausea and vomiting, resulting in avoidable deaths,” the statement warns. An additional complication is the fact that so many patients are coming in to hospital malnourished, “further reducing their resilience”. The UN’s World Food Programme estimates that around 5.2 million people in Tigray are in need of food assistance. In the statement, signed by the IDF’s president, professor Andrew Boulton of Manchester University, the medics say Ayder hospital has been assured that insulin “earmarked for Tigray” is available in Addis Ababa. They urge authorities to allow supplies to come in on the weekly flights for humanitarian staff that still operate between Mekelle and the national capital. Last week, the director general of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, attacked the Ethiopian authorities for the humanitarian crisis in Tigray, saying that the WHO had not been permitted to send medical supplies to the region since July. It was “dreadful and unimaginable”, he said, that “a government is denying its own people for more than a year food and medicine”. The foreign ministry reacted furiously to the condemnation, accusing Tedros, who is Tigrayan, of spreading misinformation and compromising the WHO’s “reputation, independence and credibility”. Earlier this month, when doctors at Ayder raised concerns about supplies of various medicines and equipment, government spokesman Legesse Tulu told Reuters: “What is happening in Tigray currently is the sole responsibility of TPLF.”",News/Global development,Medics in Tigray plead with Ethiopia for insulin airlift as supplies run out,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/15/medics-in-tigray-plead-with-ethiopia-for-insulin-airlift-as-supplies-run-out
1/16/2022,"Next month brings the likelihood of a 0.25% interest rate rise from the Bank of England, and possibly two more over the rest of the year, as Threadneedle Street seeks to dampen Britain’s overheating economy. At least that would be the reason if the economy were overheating and in need of higher interest rates. In fact, the central bank is simply revealing itself to be weaker than it was in 2011, when inflation jumped to 5% and investors, fearful of runaway prices encouraging workers to demand sky-high wages, demanded action. Interest rates then remained at historic lows.  The logic of the position the Bank took last year – that inflation would be temporary and externally driven, and for that reason beyond its influence – was reminiscent of 2011. And given the underlying weakness of the economy, that same logic still applies. Of course, inflation is a problem for households that are facing higher food and utility bills, and especially poorer households which have mostly missed out on working from home. They haven’t saved large sums during the pandemic. To solve that problem, why not reinstate last September’s cut to universal credit? Its removal amounted to a loss of about £1,000 a year, and the money would easily make up for the intangible costs of Covid as well as the more tangible gas bill rise. Meanwhile, the better-off can afford higher prices. The Bank is only concerned by the average worker’s response to inflation and whether it will be characterised by rocketing wage demands – driving incomes higher this year and next. There is little evidence for this, and it seems implausible when so many businesses have successfully driven wedges between their workers, denying them any possible collective action. What about sky-high vacancy rates? Weren’t they supposed to force almost all employers, including those that shunned unions, to pay megabucks – protecting workers against inflation and maybe offering a bit more on top? On this point, the Resolution Foundation has pulled together the latest data from the ONS surveys of online job adverts. In October, transport and logistics firms were looking for about 350,000 workers. By 6 January this had fallen to 200,000. Similar drops in demand were seen in catering and hospitality and construction, knocking another 150,000 off the 1.1m vacancy total. It’s true Omicron played a large part in the decisions employers made about needing extra staff over the festive period. Yet there was also something more fundamental going on, as the foundation’s director, Torsten Bell, says in an accompanying analysis, arguing that a messy reopening of the economy was always going to cause temporary jobs mismatches, adding that over time “capitalism is quite well set up to adjust to shifts in demand”. How else is the economy overheating? The focus is on the latest GDP figure, which shows the economy surpassed its pre-pandemic level in November and, after an Omicron dip that will mar December and January’s figures, looks like picking up again once working from home comes to an end in February. You would think the Bank would look a little deeper into why the British economy has grown, rather than just at the top line, because it is far from being a straightforward story of success, or “a testament to the grit and determination of the British people”, as the chancellor would have it. Much of it is due to the massive increase in health spending over the past two years that countries with larger and better-funded healthcare systems – France and Germany, for instance – had less need for. The construction of a Nightingale hospital feeds into GDP, as does the mothballing and deconstruction of the same shed and beds. It makes no difference to the statisticians that the temporary hospital went unused. Consumers have played a significant part in the recovery while businesses have largely kept their powder dry, holding back on investment until the outlook is clearer. But without business investment, recoveries usually lack the impetus needed to sustain them and quickly tail off. Then there are the tax rises in April that will hit employers and households – mainly the 1.25% national insurance increase, but also the freeze on income tax thresholds. The one dissenting voice on the Bank’s monetary policy committee is Silvana Tenreyro, a former professor at the London School of Economics. She argues higher prices and tax increases will have their own dampening effect without the need for the committee to change course. She makes a good point.",News/Business,"Another interest rate looms, but Britain doesn’t need this one either",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/15/another-interest-rate-looms-but-britain-doesnt-need-this-one-either
1/16/2022,"I think about food 80% of the time. I guess the other 20% is sleeping. My favourite episodes of Off Menu [Gamble’s food and drink podcast with fellow comedian James Acaster] are the ones that just spin off into ridiculous stories, or dig down into how weird people are. Serge from the band Kasabian said when he was growing up, he couldn’t eat food if there was a magician on the telly. No one’s ever said that. Then he says: “I just started thinking about how their props bag must really smell.” So we were like: “That’s the weirdest thing we’ve ever heard.” Well, actually, James was like: “No, I think I understand that.” And I’m like: “Of course you do.”  I always rejected the children’s menu. They’d hand you a horrible menu covered in sticky fingerprints, with crayon scribbled all over it that only offered fish fingers or chicken nuggets. Just base stuff for children, which is a mad way of going about things. At no point did I want to eat that. I wanted what my mum and dad were eating. My friends’ parents loved me coming over, because you could treat me like a little human dustbin. I was a lot fatter than the other children. I enjoyed every single morsel presented to me. Which I’m glad of; it gave me a good basis in food. And now that’s a large part of my job. My mum made an amazing chicken noodle dish, a really nice mozzarella pasta bake, and a chicken and sweet potato casserole. It’s really sweet, she sent me away to university with a book she made with all the recipes. And obviously I didn’t cook them once. Actually, I might have cooked the chicken noodle dish once in the third year to try and impress some people. But it was just an absolute pizza feast for three years. I didn’t expect when we met Jamie Oliver [for the podcast] that he’d get into talking about his underpants so quickly. And I certainly didn’t expect him to come back into the room at the end of the interview to show us the underpants he’d just been to the toilet to take off. But the company in question sent us some underpants, I’m wearing them right now. Any diabetic will tell you, it’s like having another, 24-hour job. Especially if you really like food and you like trying new things. Because every time you try something new, you don’t necessarily know how your body will react to it. So I really think about the impact it is going to have, but quite often I’ll go: “I’m going to eat it anyway.” I was vegan for about nine months, I gave that a go. That sums me up a little bit. If I decide I want to do something, I’ll really stick to it quite intensely for a long time. Then one day, wake up and go: “Well, I’m not doing that any more.” And I’ll go completely in the opposite direction. I got really into barbecuing during the lockdown. It became an issue. I was barbecuing five times a week when it was really nice weather. But then I did a roast lamb on the barbecue when it was snowing and I’ve done ribs when it was pissing it down with rain. Washing up is in the family genes. My grandad used to claim he was the Northern Ireland junior champion of washing up. And I believed that for a long time, because someone made him a certificate and he had it on the wall. It took me until I was about 21 to realise it was a joke. Food Slow-cooked meat. Or anything slow-cooked, really. I like the feeling of putting together ingredients and just giving it time and a little bit of heat. And then hours later pulling out something that just works and is comforting and warm. Drink A Californian cabernet sauvignon is always a pretty good bet. Restaurant The Quality Chop House in London. That’s the first place I went after the last lockdown was lifted and we sat on a little table outside and just ordered far too much.

1/16/2022,"The Nolan Show (BBC Radio Ulster) | BBC SoundsJimmy’s Jobs of the Future | apple.comNow You’re Asking with Marian Keyes and Tara Flynn (BBC Radio 4) | BBC SoundsRoom 5 (BBC Radio 4) | BBC Sounds “Stephen, I use my milk until I see all the wee white bits floating around on the top of the cup,” announces Norman from Bangor. “I remember getting a packet of crisps and they were a year out of date and I ate them and they tasted as good as the crisps you’d buy tomorrow in a shop.”  It’s Tuesday morning, the morning after the revelations about the No 10 bring-your-own-booze lockdown party. On Radio 4’s Today programme, on 5 live and LBC, the talk is of little else. Even Mike Graham on TalkRadio is spluttering at Johnson’s hubris: “All of you who say it doesn’t matter, move on: I’m afraid that’s not going to happen.” On LBC, James O’Brien is waxing loopily about Johnson’s psychology: “The only question is, why do people land on his hand like a little sparrow and start pecking these grains of dishonesty, what do they get in return?” But on Stephen Nolan’s mid-morning BBC Radio Ulster show, Nolan and his listeners are chatting about whether “the sniff test” can determine whether your food is edible. What about ice-cream, for instance? Does it go off? “I bought a tub of Caramel Chew Chew ice-cream,” says Nolan. “I got it on offer and I actually drove about three miles up the road to get the offer. But then I forgot about it for three days! I was raging! I didn’t touch it! The Caramel Chew Chew!” The show also discussed whether unionist politicians will refuse to go into government if Sinn Féin wins in the forthcoming assembly elections. But the sniff test chat was much more enjoyable. Speaking of No 10, which we definitely aren’t, the fourth series of the Jimmy’s Jobs of the Future podcast began last week, in which former Downing Street adviser Jimmy McLoughlin interviews “top entrepreneurs” about modern jobs. (It’s usually something disruptive in childcare, or finance, or gas and electricity.) The interviewee? Rishi Sunak. Sunak was perfectly nice, though it did seem as if he and McLoughlin were speaking from another country to, say, Nolan. “From your phone, it’s easy to look at your portfolio, make selections,” said Sunak. “If you have an interest in ESG [environmental, social and governance] investing, or net zero, or emerging markets, whatever you want to do. Make it easy, make it personalised.” As though everyone has spare money to invest, or spare time to monitor what they’re investing in. We’re too busy sniffing our food to see if it’s edible. If you’re after more cheer, and Nolan is not for you, then there’s plenty of warm-hearted joy to be found in Now You’re Asking, a new Radio 4 show in which the actor Tara Flynn and writer Marian Keyes tackle listeners’ problems, such as how to deal with a neighbour putting pink flamingos in the communal garden. Nobody thus far has a Caramel Chew Chew query, but you feel such a dilemma would be ideal for Flynn and Keyes, especially if given a personal twist, eg the ice-cream is your poorly mum’s favourite; should you refreeze and serve it to her? Their advice is funny and surprisingly touching, and the show flies by. Also on Radio 4, producer/presenter Helena Merriman has a new series, Room 5. As she made the excellent cold war investigative podcast Tunnel 29, you might expect this show to be a look at, say, an interrogation room during a war. Actually, Room 5 refers to something more personal. In 2019, in Room 5 at her doctor’s surgery, Merriman was diagnosed with a relatively rare medical problem – otosclerosis – that required a tricky operation and a long, bumpy recovery. Her life was changed forever by her diagnosis, and in this series she interviews people who’ve been through something similar. A sensitive and intelligent interviewer, Merriman is interested in what happens after the Room 5 moment. The medication, the rehabilitation, the strain. The real-life consequences of a couple of sentences said in a room. Her first interviewee was Bex, who, aged 20, suffered a rapidly worsening series of symptoms that culminated in her being in a state of almost continual psychosis. She heard voices, had seizures and believed everyone was conspiring against her. She couldn’t tell what was real. A neurologist noticed that Bex had become very attached to a toy penguin, and it reminded him of similar case he’d seen many years ago.

1/16/2022,"In 2009, when Amazon’s Kindle ebook was launched in the UK, it seemed impossible to imagine that a dozen years later booksellers would be reporting a record year of sales of paperbacks and hardbacks. Despite the fact that bookshops were closed for three months early in 2021, figures show that the rejuvenation of the printed word has gathered pace. That trend undermines the tech companies’ seductive promises that apps and platforms will always and inevitably eclipse physical objects. The unexpected triumph of printed books – partly a result of their enhanced design values – proves that not all upgrades represent progress.  As the great after-hours polymath Tom Waits once observed to me: “If I want to walk out in the desert and heat up a tin of beans on a fire, I still can. In movies such as Gattaca, the space-age stuff is always all there is. But in the world there is never just one way of living. It’s more like a big junkyard. Put it this way: I’m not afraid I’m going to end up on a space station in aluminium-foil underwear.” Among the more surprising books that currently feature on bestseller lists are those devoted to the biography of the ground beneath our feet. Merlin Sheldrake’s mesmerising Entangled Life, his quest into the subterranean kingdom of fungi, began that trend. I’ve subsequently been hooked on Susanne Wedlich’s uncovering of 3bn years of Slime and Robin Wall Kimmerer’s cultural history, Gathering Mosses. If these books share a thread it is that life is fundamentally cooperation; its principle “we”, not “I”. As the magically named Sheldrake puts it: “A mycelial network is a helpful reminder that all life-forms are processes not things. The ‘you’ of five years ago was made from different stuff than the ‘you’ of today. Nature is an event that never stops.” British people find it hard to take lawyers to their hearts. An exception might have to be made, however, for Jolyon Maugham and his Good Law Project. On a busy news day last Wednesday, with the competing shame of the prime minister and Prince Andrew dominating the headlines, Maugham’s latest victory in the high court, proving the illegality of the government’s “VIP lane” for PPE procurement, was relegated downpage. As the full detail of the billions squandered in the chaotic early response to the pandemic emerges, however, it may well prove the story that most defines the unravelling core belief of Johnsonism – that laws are for other people. My journalistic highlight of the past couple of years was visiting 93-year-old Jan Morris at her home in north Wales. Morris, the most mercurial of spirits, was full of a powerful presentiment both of her mortality and what might come next. She gaily imagined an afterlife that involved both a great love affair with Lord Jacky Fisher, former admiral of the fleet, and the haunting of her two spiritual homes: the River Dwyfor beside her house and the cliffs of Trieste, where she would again “watch the nightingales swarm”. Her life exemplified a belief that there’s no need to settle as a single being. That shape-shifting spirit is alive and well in the new posthumous collection of Morris’s essays, Allegorizings. In one, she dreams of an alternative Britain in which Princess Diana, our “patron sinner”, still bewitches the world in a “summer dress of blazing crimson and an amazing hat”, eternally uttering the fond farewell Morris always aspired to: “It HAS been fun!”  Tim Adams in an Observer columnist",Opinion/Opinion,Book readers have realised that you can’t replace the feel of turning a real page | Tim Adams,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/15/book-readers-have-realised-you-cant-replace-the-feel-of-turning-a-real-page
1/16/2022,"Nearly 9,000 people in England are waiting for home care services according to figures obtained by the Observer, but the true figure is likely to be much higher with the situation having worsened dramatically since last spring. Home care is provided to elderly or disabled adults in their home to help with essential tasks, such as cooking and personal care.  According to Freedom of Information responses from 96 councils in England, 8,808 people have “unallocated” or unsourced hours of home care, meaning they are not getting the home care they have been assessed as needing. The overall number of unsourced hours rose from 15,905 in April 2021 to 60,664 in December. People with unsourced care may be going without, but are more likely to be receiving care in a less appropriate setting, such as in hospitals or care homes, or being looked after unpaid by family members. Caroline Abrahams, Age UK’s charity director, said: “It comes to something when so many paid-for hours of care are not being used, all because there aren’t enough staff to put them into effect. This inevitably means that growing numbers of older and disabled people are going without the care and support they need, and that where unpaid carers are helping their loved ones, they are being forced to do more for longer, unaided and with no chance of a break. “The prospects for anyone who is waiting for care and on their own, without family or other support, are extremely grim – one has to wonder how some of these people are managing to carry on at all. “It is tempting for policymakers to place all the blame for the growing care workforce crisis on Covid-19 … but it’s been coming for a long time. Where we are now is what happens when there is no effective workforce planning over many years. It would be hard to exaggerate how worried we are about what’s going to happen to home care this year, and to the millions of older and disabled people who rely on it every day.” Jane Townson, chief executive of the Homecare Association, said retention and recruitment of care workers is “more difficult than ever”, blaming “inadequate government investment in social care”. Many staff, she said, leave for better paid jobs in sectors such as retail and hospitality. “We are struggling massively to have any support whatsoever,” Ellen Fenby, whose 19-year-old son is severely disabled, told the Observer. “There’s a lack of staff, there’s a lack of people in the industry, there’s a lack of being able to train people to come in and support us. Since July of last year we have had no support in the home whatsoever.” Fenby’s son has multiple medical needs including brain damage and internal organ problems. Last summer he had to have a PEG tube fitted, which allows feeding directly into the stomach, after he developed severe problems swallowing. “He went from a young person eating normally like everybody else does, to all of a sudden not being able to eat by his mouth, everything by his PEG. We were having to do that feeding, we were having to manage the care of the stoma site, the care of his food and making sure his nutrition and hydration was correct. So his care need grew significantly.” Their local council assessed he needed more care – two hours of home care every eveningfor personal care and his feeding regime. The council increased the funding for Fenby’s son but the family can’t spend it as no provision is available. “It’s sitting there. We’ve been paid the money from the council, and we simply cannot find anybody to be able to actually take those hours,” said Fenby. “It has been very stressful. Both my husband and I have full-time jobs, we have three other children. Trying to make sure he still has his care needs met while trying to seek other agencies – I’m constantly emailing all the agencies in the area to try and see if there is anybody. There is a massive lack of anybody that is PEG-trained.” Nor can they spend the money on other forms of care. Her son’s mental health has suffered, his needs have grown and new elements of his disability have emerged. “We have come to a point where we are a family in crisis, because the need has grown significantly that we are struggling to cope,” Fenby said. The Department for Health and Social Care did not respond to a request for comment.",News/Society,Vulnerable adults left without care in England as staff crisis worsens,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/15/vulnerable-adults-left-without-care-in-england-as-staff-crisis-worsens
1/16/2022,"“Trust has been broken.” “A line has been crossed.” “The prime minister’s position is no longer tenable.” While Conservative MPs have largely nursed their anger privately at the barrage of lockdown-busting party revelations from Downing Street, their Scottish MSP counterparts were blunt and unbridled last week, calling for Boris Johnson to quit in a rebellion that was as unprecedented as it was united. Almost all the 31 Scottish Tory MSPs publicly supported their leader, Douglas Ross, after he became the first senior Tory figure to “regretfully” call for Johnson’s departure, following the prime minister’s admission at PMQs last Wednesday that he had attended a party at Downing Street in May 2020 which contravened his government’s own lockdown rules.  While Ross’s predecessors, Ruth Davidson and Jackson Carlaw, have likewise called for the PM to go, the Scotland secretary, Alister Jack, is the only one of six Scottish Tory MPs to openly back Johnson, suggesting his Holyrood colleagues “reconsider” their position if Sue Gray’s report exonerates Johnson. But the MSPs’ support for their leader’s stand appears to have been solidified by outrage at the response from the leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, who dismissed Ross as “lightweight” and – wrongly – accused him of serial disloyalty. Sotto voce suggestions from some English colleagues that Scottish Tories were playing to the gallery, or pre-empting Scottish Nationalist criticism at Holyrood, are dismissed by those more familiar with the local dynamics. There are frustrations and tensions within any political party, says one senior source, but this was an exceptional circumstance given Ross had stated explicitly both earlier last week and last month that Johnson should resign if it emerged that he had misled parliament: “Douglas Ross is very principled: he resigned over Dominic Cummings, he called out Nicola Sturgeon [when she was accused of misleading parliament over the Alex Salmond crisis], and he had no alternative here.” The reasons for this escalation in long-recognised and sometimes creative tensions with the Westminster party are both principled and practical, says Adam Morris, a communications consultant and former head of media for the Scottish Conservatives: “Douglas had no choice but to ramp up his position. He’s taken a strong position on this before and was not comfortable with taking responsibility for something he didn’t do and wouldn’t have done.” Morris points out it is not as easy to hide at Holyrood: the MSP group was doorstepped on their way in to first minister’s questions last Thursday, where Sturgeon said Rees-Mogg had illustrated the Tories’ “utter contempt” for Scotland. “If they can’t even show basic respect for their own colleagues, what chance do the rest of us have?” she said. On his way to the session, Jamie Greene, the Scottish Tory party’s justice spokesman, urged Rees-Mogg to “go and have a long lie down, maybe not in the House of Commons,” referring to the notorious image of the minister lounging on the green benches. Others vented frustration that remarks such as Rees-Mogg’s not only write the pro-independence playbook, but make it substantially harder to convince Scottish voters that the UK Tories genuinely care about Scotland’s place in the union. Morris says that, while Ross probably laughed off the remarks, he remains angry about the wider circumstances. “Why is he getting put through all this weeks before the first elections he has fought as leader in the Holyrood parliament? He is furious at the distraction.” Ross was still to be re-elected as an MSP and had been leader for just nine months when he successfully defended all Scottish Tory seats at last May’s Holyrood election, despite the continuing Brexit fallout and the popularity of Sturgeon’s pandemic leadership. Sources suggest support within the MSP group for Ross’s position was not heavily orchestrated, but happened naturally. It is understood that many MSPs are disheartened at the lack of airtime to discuss their own policy agenda, or indeed Scottish government failings, because of scandals emanating from Westminster. Even before his election as UK leader, senior Scottish Conservatives feared Johnson could be a “catastrophe” for the UK, turbocharging the campaign for Scottish independence, and reportedly codenamed attempts to foil him “Operation Arse”. Last month, Ipsos Mori recorded its lowest ever approval levels for the prime minister among Scottish voters. MSPs appeared in contemplative mood over the weekend, with some reportedly shocked at the extent of the backlash from Westminster: what may smart more than Rees-Mogg is the usually soothing Michael Gove’s dismissal of Ross as being “in Elgin and the national Tory leader is in London”. Nonetheless, anger from England is more than matched by the anger of Scottish constituents. MSP Sue Webber described Ross’s call for Johnson’s resignation as “a decision with potentially far-reaching impact”. Already the discussion is moving to the possibility for a breakaway or allied centre-right party, first proposed by respected veteran MSP Murdo Fraser a decade ago. More pressingly, if Johnson clings to his premiership, the rift with Westminster can only deepen as the council elections approach. What will the impact of such a toxic stalemate be on the doorstep for MSPs who are desperate to discuss their own ideas for a right to recovery for drug addicts or scrapping the “not proven” verdict to benefit sexual assault complainers? And how will it benefit a Scottish Labour party – which pledged last week it would stand only pro-union candidates – desperate to beat the Tories back into third place?",News/Politics,"Scottish Conservatives are furious, and in no mood to be rebuked from London",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/15/scottish-conservatives-are-furious-and-in-no-mood-to-be-rebuked-from-london
1/16/2022,"A mother whose baby was stillborn while she was in hospital with Covid-19 has urged people to get vaccinated to save themselves the “agony” of becoming seriously ill with the virus. Rachel, 38, from Bilston in Wolverhampton, who did not wish to use her surname, was so unwell she did not realise she had given birth to her son Jaxon, at 24 weeks, in August, and was in a coma and in hospital for three and a half months after contracting the virus.  She had gone to get her vaccine while pregnant, but was discouraged by guidance at that early stage of the rollout advising expectant women to perhaps not have it. She said she and her family were “devastated” by the death of her baby, and urged everyone eligible to take up the offer of jabs. She told PA: “I did initially go to get the vaccine, but at the time the advice was not to have it. “I thought I’d have the vaccine when I’d had the baby, but it wasn’t meant to be.” Earlier this week the government launched an advertising campaign encouraging expectant mothers to get vaccinated and boosted, after data had previously shown the vaccine to be safe in pregnancy. The Department of Health and Social Care cited statistics from the UK Obstetric Surveillance System which showed 96.3% of pregnant women admitted to hospital with Covid-19 symptoms between May and October were unvaccinated, a third of whom required respiratory support. In December, the UK’s vaccines watchdog made pregnant women a priority group for vaccination after research showing they are vulnerable to more serious illness and pregnancy complications if they are infected with Covid-19. In November last year, experts warned that while uptake of the vaccine among pregnant women was improving, they were worried about some groups shunning the jabs, including younger women, those in the most deprived areas and women from black and minority ethnic communities. Rachel, who thanked staff at both New Cross hospital’s integrated critical care unit (ICCU) and Glenfield hospital in Leicester for their care, said it was “really important” everyone had their vaccines. “I would say take [the vaccine] – it’s a two-minute thing that can save months of agony if you end up like I was,” the bereaved mother said. Speaking about her loss, she said: “I didn’t actually know I had given birth. I was on drugs so they wanted to tell me when I wasn’t sedated, and the obstetrician informed me a few days later. “My emotions were disbelief – one minute you’re having a scan and a gender reveal, naming the baby and getting excited, and then there was this sudden loss. “I was only able to see him once. Normally I’d have been able to spend a lot more time with him and to hold him. But I didn’t get to do that because of the circumstances.” She said things have been difficult for her partner and her 18-year-old son. “We’re all devastated at our loss,” she said. “We were all very excited at this new life, then we were left with nothing.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Mother who gave birth to stillborn son while in Covid coma urges people to get vaccine,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/15/mother-who-gave-birth-to-stillborn-son-while-in-covid-coma-urges-people-to-get-vaccine
1/16/2022,"Protesters have taken to the streets in cities across the UK to rally against the police and crime bill, which is reaching its final stages in parliament. The police, crime, sentencing and courts bill, sections of which have been condemned by human rights activists as an attack on the right to protest, will be voted on in the House of Lords on Monday.  Hundreds of “kill the bill” protesters rallied in London on Saturday, while demonstrations also took place in cities including Bristol, Cardiff, Coventry, Newcastle, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Sheffield and Plymouth. Police just asked to look inside the coffin! pic.twitter.com/OobFiEdkF8 In the capital, demonstrators marched from Holborn to Parliament Square carrying signs reading “defend the right to protest”, while one protester carried a coffin with the words “UK democracy – murdered by the Tories” printed on its side. Many also carried Extinction Rebellion flags. Terry Matthews, 69, from south London, told PA Media: “I think we’re facing a really vitriolic attack on our rights to protest and our freedoms to show our dissatisfaction with the status of the government and the country. And it’s a really dangerous step to try to take.” Addressing the crowd in Parliament Square, the Labour peer Shami Chakrabarti said the bill’s anti-protest provisions “represent the greatest attack on peaceful dissent in living memory”. “This rightwing, authoritarian government used to encourage pro-Brexit demos and statue defenders when it suited them,” she said. Chakrabarti accused the government of hypocrisy, saying it “bangs on about free speech and whinges about cancel culture” and other countries “where fundamental rights are under attack” while clamping down on rights in the UK. “Free speech is a two-way street. And you know what? The ultimate cancel culture, it doesn’t come with a tweet – it comes with a police baton and a prison sentence for nonviolent dissent,” she said. The bill’s anti-protest measures grant police the power to ban marches and demonstrations that they consider to be “seriously disruptive”, including those deemed too noisy. Gypsy, Roma and traveller communities would effectively be criminalised by measures against residing on land without authorisation, while police would also be granted expanded stop and search powers and sentences of up to 10 years could be handed down for damage to memorials or statues. Labour members in the House of Lords will oppose last-minute amendments to the bill, it was announced on Friday. The amendments added in November, which focus on new powers to control protests, include new offences for “locking on” – where protesters attach themselves to objects or each other – and would give police the power to ban named individuals from protesting.",News/UK news,Protesters rally across UK against police and crime bill,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/15/protesters-rally-across-uk-against-police-and-bill
1/16/2022,"More than 125 years ago, representatives of a number of rugby union clubs from the north of England gathered at the George hotel in Huddersfield. The meeting resulted in the formation of a new sport, known today as rugby league. Now a row between the local council and those wanting to honour the sport with a museum at the site of its formation threatens to overshadow the sport’s legacy. The idea began harmoniously when, several years ago, leading rugby league charity Rugby League Cares announced plans to create a National Rugby League Museum. Towns and cities from across the sport’s traditional northern heartlands were invited to apply to host the project. Huddersfield won the bidding process in 2020, beating competition from the likes of Leeds, Bradford and Wigan, with the local Kirklees council offering the George as the venue for the new museum.It was a deliberate offer with deep significance to the sport. The fact that Huddersfield’s bid was centred on the George was seen as crucial by many insiders as to why Kirklees council beat off competition from other towns and cities that were arguably better resourced to take on such a significant cultural project.  “There aren’t many sports where you can pinpoint the exact location it was founded,” said Professor Tony Collins, social historian and chair of the independent panel that awarded the museum to Huddersfield.However, the council has now decided it will not use the George for the museum, instead offering a different location in the town. This was greeted with horror by many league supporters, Rugby League Cares and the Rugby Football League (RFL). It has even led to calls from local politicians for the resignation of the council’s leader, Shabir Pandor. “A lot of people feel betrayed by Kirklees council,” said Collins. “Because of what they promised initially, but also the importance of the George to not only the heritage of the game, but also British sport. It highlights a bigger issue for the heritage of Huddersfield, because a major part of the town’s real history is at risk of being lost. One of the town’s key claims to fame is being the birthplace of rugby league and that’s now in danger of being left behind and abandoned.” Talks continued late last week between the council, the charity and the chief executive of the RFL, Ralph Rimmer, and the possibility of an alternative venue in Huddersfield has been raised. But the Observer understands there is little appetite for a different site from either the governing body or the charity. Last night, RFL said: “Rugby League Cares and the RFL are continuing to seek clarification from Kirklees council about both their volte-face on the viability of the George Hotel and the actual location of an alternative venue.” Collins also poured scorn on the idea of a different Huddersfield venue. “The council don’t have a viable alternative, nor do they have a track record of suggesting they have the capability of supporting a museum somewhere else. To say it’s disappointing is an understatement and it’s such a shame for the sport.” The George was home to a predecessor of the proposed museum, the Rugby League Heritage Centre. That project was the brainchild of former Great Britain international Mike Stephenson and opened in 2005 to great fanfare from the sport’s supporters, but closed several years later. Before its closure in January 2013, the George was regularly visited by fans of the game from across the globe, for its significance in the sport’s formation. The building was bought by Kirklees council in 2020 for £1.8m. Pandor has previously claimed that failing to walk away from the deal could have cost local taxpayers in excess of £20m. Kirklees council failed to respond to requests for comment by the Observer. All of which suggests the National Rugby League Museum is likely to end up somewhere other than the sport’s spiritual home. The Observer has been told at least three towns across the sport’s heartlands would be interested in putting together a bid if the project went back to tender.Wigan’s original bid, for example, was believed to be so strong in the initial tender process that only the attraction of the museum being housed at the George made the difference and saw Huddersfield awarded the project.",Sport/Sport,Huddersfield scrum: row over siting of new museum engulfs rugby league,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/15/huddersfield-scrum-row-over-siting-of-new-museum-engulfs-rugby-league
