12/28/2021,"The biggest success of the fossil fuel industry’s decades-long campaign to push doubt about climate science is that it forced the conversation about the climate crisis to centre on science. It’s not that we didn’t need scientific research into climate change, or that we don’t need plenty more of it. Or even that we don’t need to do a better job of explaining basic science to people, across the board (hello, Covid). But at this moment, “believe science” is too high a bar for something that demands urgent action. Believing science requires understanding it in the first place. In the US, the world’s second biggest carbon polluter, fewer than 40% of the population are college educated and in many states, schools in the public system don’t have climate science on the curriculum. So where should this belief – strong enough to push for large-scale social and behavioural change – be rooted exactly?  People don’t need to know anything at all about climate science to know that a profound injustice has occurred here that needs to be righted. It’s not a scientific story, it’s a story of fairness: people with more power and money than you used information about climate change to shore up their own prospects and told you not to worry about it. That story is backed up by not only the internal memos of various oil companies, and the discrepancies between those internal communications and what they were telling the public, but also by their patents. In 1973, Exxon secured a patent for an oil tanker that could easily navigate a melting Arctic. In 1974, Texaco was granted a patent for a mobile drilling platform in a melting Arctic. Chevron got a patent for its version of a melting-Arctic-ready drilling platform that same year. Shell was a bit behind; it got its melting-Arctic drilling platform design patented in 1983. When she was shown this evidence of oil companies’ preparations for a warming world, Lori French was shocked. French’s family fish for crab off the coast of California, and their business has been rocked by warming waters over the past several years. But she and her husband are not big “believers” in climate catastrophe. “We’re kind of both of the opinion that climate change has happened since the beginning of time,” she says. You might be surprised to learn that she told me this in 2019, shortly after her family and several other crabbers had signed on to support a lawsuit by their trade association against the 30 largest oil companies in the world for their role in delaying action on climate. Not because of science, but because of fairness. They were shown various documents detailing how the fossil fuel industry had been preparing to not just weather climate impacts but continue to profit as the glaciers melted. “When we saw that information, that was a definite gamechanger,” she told me. “It was like, oh there’s this higher thing controlling the choices you’re allowed to have. And I would like to believe, in my Pollyanna world, that most people are operating on an honest, level playing field. But they don’t.” For French, it didn’t really matter whether climate change is caused by burning fossil fuels or natural planetary force. She sidestepped the origin story of climate change and instead focused on the injustice inherent in preparing your own business for trouble while telling everyone else not to worry. Climate change is affecting fisheries all over the world, of course, and displacing entire communities. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), climate change is already affecting every region on Earth, in multiple ways, from rising seas to intensifying storms and wildfires. The World Bank predicts more than 200 million people are likely to migrate over the next three decades because of extreme weather events or the disappearance of their homelands. In 2020, 30.7 million people were internally displaced by disasters, over three times more than conflict and violence (9.8 million people). That displacement – like other climate impacts – is hitting communities in the global south first, and will disproportionately affect poor and working-class people all over the world. Meanwhile, in the same decade during which scientists’ warnings about climate change have grown more dire, social science researchers have discovered that there is almost no correlation between public understanding of climate science and risk perception, and thus little to no relationship between grasping the science of climate change, believing the scientists’ warnings, and doing anything at all about it. There is a relationship, though, between Americans’ awareness of inequality or injustice and their willingness to support social change. A Norwegian study surveying the impact of various climate stories found that those with heroes and villains had “a large persuasive impact” on readers. A study of students in six countries found that a justice framework spurred young people to act on the climate. For more evidence that a righteous sense of indignation, rather than a scientific understanding of problems, drives social change, you need only look at history. The US entering the second world war (the war effort people most like to compare with what’s needed to address climate change)? Check. The civil rights, consumer protection, women’s rights, anti-war and gay rights movements? Check again. All driven by moral outrage at the power being wielded by the few over the many. Climate crisis is not a scientific or technical problem, it is an issue of justice and political will. Acting on it calls into question not just our energy source, but our power structures, catalysing widespread social change. The only thing that’s ever really succeeded in doing that are justice movements – public outcries over blatant injustice and a demand for change. If progressives and climate activists want to have any hope of spurring the kind of movement necessary to shift political and economic interests away from fossil fuels, it’s time to put aside “believe science” and instead embrace a broad fight for justice.

12/28/2021,"Britons are concerned that hypocrisy by politicians will affect the public’s willingness to change their own behaviour to tackle the climate crisis – and doubt that Cop26 commitments can be met unless they are legally binding. The opinions come from the latest in the Net Zero Diaries, a project run by the consultancy Britain Thinks to examine evolving attitudes to the pursuit of a net zero emissions target, the first collation of public views from the cohort since the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow.  The focus group project involved 40 people keeping diaries of news events and their everyday climate encounters, and hearing from a range of experts. Post-Cop26, many said it was the first climate summit they had engaged with, with several feeling “excited and hopeful” at the gathering of world leaders. The researchers examining the diaries found those who were originally less engaged on climate issues tended to believe Cop26 had been a resounding success because of the extensive coverage. But even those who described themselves as having a strong interest in the environment were unable to name detailed specifics on what had been agreed on issues such as coal and deforestation. There was considerable criticism of the role of richer countries as opposed to aid for the developing world. One described the outcome as “mean-spirited as the developed world made pledges of support to the developing world yet had failed to uphold previous promises”. Two key moments in particular stood out to diarists from throughout the conference: the US president, Joe Biden, appearing to fall asleep during one discussion, and Boris Johnson flying to London for a dinner after opening the summit. “It clearly didn’t get people involved if they were falling asleep during it,” one said. “I feel Boris Johnson was very hypocritical travelling by plane in between this – surely he could have utilised technology or at least travelled by an electric vehicle,” another pointed out. Some diarists felt these moments undermined the importance of Cop26, and fuelled diarists’ concerns that powerful global leaders are not taking the issue seriously. Participants were also deeply sceptical about some of the agreements, and whether they would stick. “None of the agreements are legally binding and are phrased as quite vague statements,” one diarist wrote. “On the main points, the countries mainly responsible did not sign those agreements.” Most participants, given an article to read about the conference, picked up on the fact that commitments are self-policing and expressed concern that they would not be upheld, with those who were more engaged pointing to the fallout from the commitments made at the Paris summit. Overwhelmingly, the most popular and best-understood pledge was the global commitment to end and reverse deforestation, with commitments from leaders including Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro. Land-clearing of forests contributes almost a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions, with clearances for the growing of agricultural products such as palm oil, soy and beef. Several diarists said the pledge was believable because it linked specifically to a practice that drives the climate crisis and because it was backed by a multi-billion dollar finance package. The research was commissioned by the energy company Ovo, Citizens Advice, WWF and Lancaster University, and diarists were recruited to reflect differing views on climate, from engaged activists to low-engagement regular consumers.",News/Environment,Britons think politicians’ hypocrisy will hamper tackling climate crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/28/britons-think-politicians-hypocrisy-will-hamper-tackling-climate-crisis
12/28/2021,"Clashes have reportedly broken out between hunters and protesters during a tense Boxing Day meet in Wiltshire. Video footage shared on social media appeared to show punches being thrown from both sides as mounted riders moved through Lacock village, near Chippenham, for the annual Avon Vale Boxing Day hunt.  The Hunt Saboteurs Association (HSA) has accused hunters of resorting to violence on one of the biggest days in the hunting industry’s calendar. Like many hunts of its kind, the Boxing Day hunt took place on 27 December because this year’s holiday fell on a Sunday, traditionally a day of rest for the hunting community. Punches thrown as violence erupts at annual Boxing Day Hunt in rural Wiltshire. Clashes and scuffles broke out at the Boxing Day Hunt in Lacock, near Chippenham. Several dozen protesters were demonstrating against the Avon Vale meet and least 2 were injured. #BoxingDay pic.twitter.com/fZ4yWcP9y4 It is not clear how the fighting broke out or who was involved. Footage showed anti-hunt protesters shouting “shame on you” at a group of riders and in another video, a woman holding a sign is pushed to the ground. Wiltshire police said officers attended the hunt at about 11am after “concerns were raised about tensions between those involved in the hunt and protesters”. They said the two groups were dispersed and no arrests had been made at this stage. A statement from the Avon Vale Hunt said: “The hunt has been made aware of an incident that occurred just after the hounds had left the meet in Lacock today. We do not know the circumstances but we do not condone violence even in the case of extreme provocation by anti-hunting protesters. “We would like to thank the many hundreds of people who peacefully attended today in support of our hounds.” Despite the worsening Covid-19 situation and growing calls to ban the practice on public land, many Boxing Day hunts went ahead this year. Critics are demanding the prohibition on public land of a sport they believe is often merely a front for illegal foxhunting. The Scottish Greens renewed their call for an outright ban on foxhunting in Scotland. An HSA spokesperson said: “Foxhunters’ backs are against the wall and they’re increasingly resorting to violence as the pressure increases.”",News/UK news,Protesters and hunters clash at Boxing Day meet in Wiltshire,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/27/protesters-and-hunters-clash-at-boxing-day-meet-in-wiltshire
