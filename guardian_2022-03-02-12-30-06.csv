3/2/2022,"Median home prices in Sydney could drop below $1m by the end of next year, new modelling suggests. In Melbourne, the median price could drop to about $700,000. Finance website RateCity has used the Commonwealth Bank of Australia’s housing market forecasts – which show increasing interest rates and falling house prices – and applied them to units and apartments as well. In Sydney, the median house price at 28 February was $1,410,128. The forecasts show that would drop by almost $200,000 to $1,213,686 by the end of 2023 with a drop of 3% this year and 9% next year. Once that is expanded to all dwellings, the median price now is $1,116,219. It would fall by $146,651 to $969,568. Melbourne would drop from $799,756 to $701,842. All other capital cities showed further increases this year, followed by decreases next year, leading to overall price increases. Nationally, there would be an 8% drop in dwelling and house prices. The website’s research director, Sally Tindall, said it could signal “the beginning of the end” of property price peaks in Melbourne and Sydney. “If CBA forecasts are realised, the median dwelling price in Sydney could fall by almost $150,000 by the end of 2023,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “If house prices follow the same trajectory, we could be looking at drops of almost $200,000 for a median-priced house in Australia’s largest city from today to the end of 2023.” New Australian Bureau of Statistics and CoreLogic figures published yesterday show house price growth slowed in February despite record housing loans. The Grattan Institute’s economic policy program director, Brendan Coates, said lower prices would make housing more accessible for first homebuyers, but that they would face higher interest rates. “Lower rates have been the biggest driver of rising prices, so you should expect the inverse to hold as well,” he said. “There’ll be one-third of the population that celebrates house prices falling and two-thirds that lament it.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app Tindall said any price drops came “off the back of monumental gains” that had sent equity “skyrocketing”. “People might not like the idea of losing equity in their home over the next couple of years, but it’s worth looking at the bigger picture,” she said. “While falling property prices can be stressful for anyone buying at or near the peak, if they keep their head down and their mortgage repayments up, they should be able to ride out any dips.” On the other hand, Tindall said, price drops could help people enter the property market. “However, would-be first homebuyers should crunch the numbers before they pop the champagne,” she said. “If property prices fall on the back of rising rates, buyers might not need to stump up as much for a deposit. They will, however, need to make higher monthly repayments, which means they won’t be able to borrow as much from the bank. “First homebuyers should think carefully about overextending themselves in a market where rates are set to rise and prices are forecast to fall. Make sure you have a buffer to ride out any bumps.”",News/Australia news,"Median home price could fall below $1m in Sydney and about $700,000 in Melbourne next year",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/02/median-home-price-could-fall-below-1m-in-sydney-and-about-700000-in-melbourne-next-year
3/2/2022,"Getting runaway prices in America under control is “my top priority” Joe Biden told Congress on Tuesday in his first State of the Union address. Soaring inflation - now at a 40-year high - has hurt Biden in the polls and the US president bluntly acknowledged “too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills. Inflation is robbing them of the gains they might otherwise feel”. The US has added 6.6m jobs since Biden took office and the unemployment rate has dropped to 4%, down from a pandemic high of 14.8% in April 2020. But soaring inflation has overshadowed his economic successes, rising at an annual rate of 7.5% over the year through January. Biden said he would cut energy costs, the price of prescription drugs, and childcare in the US while ​​increasing competition between companies and making sure “corporations and the wealthiest Americans start paying their fair share”. “Economists call it ‘increasing the productive capacity of our economy’. I call it building a better America,” said Biden. Biden’s plans face heavy headwinds. On Tuesday, oil prices spiked again, passing $100 a barrel again as the war in Ukraine escalated. The rise will further increase costs for US consumers who are already paying high prices at the pump due to Covid 19-related issues. The average gallon of gas in the US was $3.61 as of 1 March, compared with $2.72 a gallon one year ago. Many of Biden’s initiatives will also struggle to pass in a deeply divided Washington as the US heads into midterm elections this November, with polling suggesting Republicans could take control of Congress.

3/2/2022,"Oksana Markarova, the ambassador of Ukraine to the US, was given a standing ovation at the US Capitol on Tuesday nightduring Joe Biden’s first State of the Union address to Congress. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine dominated the early part of Biden’s speech, as the president condemned Vladimir Putin’s “tyranny” and announced he would ban Russian aircraft from US airspace. Putin “thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over”, Biden said. But then, the Russian leader “met the Ukrainian people”. “Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees, teachers, turned soldiers defending their homeland,” Biden said. “In this struggle, as President Zelenskiy said in his speech to the European Parliament: ‘Light will win over darkness,’” Biden said. “The Ukrainian ambassador to the United States is here tonight. Let each of us here tonight in this chamber send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world.” Markarova, who was invited to the speech as a guest of Jill Biden, the first lady, was visibly moved as she stood and thanked the attendees, prompting a standing ovation in the House of Representatives. Clutching a Ukrainian flag, Markarova was embraced by Jill Biden as the applause continued. In a sign of support for the Ukrainian people, the first lady had an embroidered appliqué of a sunflower, the national flower of Ukraine, sewn to the sleeve of her dress near her wrist. Markarova was appointed ambassador by Zelenskiy in February 2021, having previously served as Ukraine’s finance minister. She met with a bipartisan group of senators on Monday night, where she asked for increased military support from the US, the Wall Street Journal reported. Chris Murphy, a Democratic senator for Connecticut, was present at the meeting and said Markarova had “made clear that they’re going to run out of Stingers and Javelins [missiles] really fast”.",News/World news,Ukraine’s ambassador to US gets standing ovation at Biden’s State of the Union,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/ukraine-ambassador-standing-ovation-state-of-the-union
3/2/2022,"After 697 days and one false start, the “hermit” state of Western Australia is on the precipice of rejoining the rest of the world – again. The premier, Mark McGowan, has promised to throw open WA’s gates from midnight Wednesday as the state moves headlong into its first full-scale Covid wave of the pandemic, with daily case numbers swelling into four digits. Perth has just emerged from its hottest summer on record and the state is still grappling with a food supply crisis caused by flood damage to the country’s only east-west rail link. For many, being locked inside WA for the best part of two years has been a nightmare. Some businesses have crumbled from a lack of tourists and foreign workers, while families and friends have grieved the forced separation. Others have lived the dream. With just a scattered couple of short lockdown events, Western Australians have faced mild restrictions and the devastation of the Covid pandemic was locked out – until now. The number of active infections is nudging 6,000, and although WA’s health system is poised to move from amber to red alert when the border opens, McGowan admits continuing to seal off WA is a waste of time now that the main Covid threat is coming from within the state. He says the state leads the nation’s vaccination program with close to 99% of the population above the age of 12 double-dosed. Third-dose vaccination rates have hit 64%. “The government intervened in ways other states haven’t in order to save lives and I think the evidence is there that the measures we put in place have worked,” McGowan says. There are currently 16 people in WA hospitals with Covid, some of them with other conditions, and no one in intensive care with the disease. “But the advice is, from our health professionals, that the numbers will grow rapidly in hospital and we have to put these [level 2 restriction] measures in place to save lives,” McGowan says. Controversial social distancing measures, which include forcing children from year 3 upwards to wear face masks, also come into effect from 12.01am Thursday. Among the new rules is that home gatherings will be limited to 10 people indoors and outdoors, except at weddings and funerals, and the 2sq/m restrictions will be enforced for venues such as hospitality, entertainment and night clubs. The long list of new restrictions is expected to stay in place for four weeks, the premier says. Meanwhile, the government tabled long-awaited WA health department modelling on the Omicron variant eight days ago in parliament. It projected that Covid would peak at the end of March at more than 10,000 daily new cases, and around four deaths a day. Forecasts say 443 people will be hospitalised at that time and 56 patients will need intensive care. In six months, about 500,000 West Australians are predicted to be have been infected. WA had been scheduled to reopen on Saturday 5 February when double-dose vaccination rates in the state hit 90%. McGowan dramatically backflipped on the timing just 16 days out from the promised opening date. He denied state hospitals weren’t ready, said Omicron had changed the game and he did not want to see an overwhelming wave like those in Sydney and Melbourne. The condemnation was swift, and so was the dip in McGowan’s polling numbers. Australia’s most popular premier nosedived from an approval rating of 91% in September 2020 to 64% by February 2022, according to a phone-based People’s Voice poll. At the time, the head of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Omar Khorshid, said the premier was a “one-trick pony” and labelled the border delay a dangerous decision. Khorsid wasn’t alone in opposing the delay and pushing the Omicron peak closer to winter with more than 1,000 WA doctors signing a petition opposing the hard border. At the time, McGowan had not released any modelling to back his decision. He instead said the advice from his chief health officer was that delaying the reopening would allow time for people to receive a third-dose vaccination – increasing protection from Omicron from 4% to 64%. The WA opposition leader, Mia Davies, says the premier’s inconsistent messaging has caused the public to lose trust in its leader. “There will be significant work to do in rebuilding WA’s reputation as an amazing place to live, work, and invest, after two years of telling people to stay away,” the Nationals leader says. “The McGowan government has starved our hospitals of resources for five years. It’s yet to be seen how the health system will cope with significant Covid-19 case numbers.” On the ground, one of Perth’s biggest beachfront restaurants has just dropped its breakfast offering. Odyssea City Beach managing director Fabio Hupfer says the new restrictions are keeping customers away and alongside a labour shortage for the past 20 months, the 366-seat venue had to sacrifice something to survive. “We have one of the highest inoculated regions and states in the world – why the heck do we have to have all these restrictions when it has such an impact?” Hupfer says. The Tourism Council WA chief executive, Evan Hall, says the border restrictions have devastated WA’s tourism business. “Events have borne the brunt of border closures and restrictions. Caps on events need to be lifted as soon as possible,” Hall said. “The eastern states are now removing business restrictions and travel testing requirements. “WA cannot afford to be more restricted than the east coast for longer than necessary or we will lose events, students, workers and tourists to states with less severe restrictions.” McGowan promises this time he will stay true to his word, but that the coming month will be WA’s most difficult of the entire pandemic. Tonight’s border opening will be the first test.",News/Australia news,Western Australia border reopening tests McGowan as Covid peak looms,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/02/western-australia-border-reopening-tests-mcgowan-as-covid-peak-looms
3/2/2022,"The deadly flooding in Queensland and New South Wales has sparked an outpouring of grief across the country, with Australians eager to offer assistance. The Mud Army is being reformed in Brisbane, coordinated by the Brisbane City Council. But with thousands displaced, more to be evacuated and authorities still wading through the wreckage, much more will need to be done in the coming days, months and years. Guardian Australia has compiled a list of how to best provide help to residents in Queensland and New South Wales. Donate to charities Donating money is the most practical way to offer immediate flood assistance, particularly as the flood waters begin to recede. A number of major charities, including the Australian Red Cross and Vinnies, are accepting donations to provide urgent relief and humanitarian support to flood-affected communities. The Red Cross is coordinating a disaster appeal across both states. Funds will be used to provide vital humanitarian support, including enabling volunteers and staff to help with evacuations, relief centres, outreach services and ongoing support. The SES and State Fire Service are working with volunteers to help those in the worst hit areas. You can donate to the Queensland SES here, and the New South Wales SES here. Clothes, groceries and unwanted goods are not, in general, appropriate items to donate unless they are specifically being requested by charities. Instead, check with local recovery committees to see what needs to be done and what specific items are needed, or – if you know those directly affected – check in on friends and family. Offer to wash and dry items to see what can be salvaged, or help empty a cupboard.

Via the platform users can donate items, funds or time depending on what specific requests have been made from people and communities affected by storms and flooding. Local charities and groups are also accepting assistance. Koori Mail has released a GoFundMe for the Bundjalung communities and missions that have been cut off due to Lismore floods, with donations going towards temporary accommodation and emergency supplies. Educate yourself and listen After the initial crisis, recovery from a severe weather event takes weeks, months and, often, years. It is in this time that people who have lived through the natural disaster are most in need of support. Trauma lingers long after the clean-up is over. Those who have lived through floods say it is vital at this time to allow family and friends to talk about what they’ve experienced once the volunteers have retreated. Those affected may need professional help. Those feeling anxious, lonely and distressed can be directed to the following agencies for help: Lifeline has a team of professional counsellors who can talk to you about your mental health concerns, or those you have for a loved one. You can call the 24/7 crisis support helpline on 13 11 14 or text or message them online here. Beyond Blue also provides a 24/7 counselling service over the phone. You can reach them at 1300 22 4636, or visit them online to direct message or email a counseller. Headspace also helps young Australians experiencing mental health concerns – call them on 1800 650 890 or contact them online here. Lifeline also has a Lifeline Community Recovery team who visit communities to provide counselling and psychological first aid in the weeks and months after major weather events.
