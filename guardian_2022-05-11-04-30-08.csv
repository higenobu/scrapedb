5/11/2022,"The process of adjusting to the rigours and intensity of a full tennis season always stood as a challenging task for Emma Raducanu in the wake of her US Open victory, but even so her inability to remain healthy throughout this season has been alarming. Some sort of ailment has followed her during most weeks of this year and it played a defining role once more in her Italian Open debut on Tuesday. After blisters, a hip injury, other back issues, illness and medical timeouts in most tournaments she has played this year, Raducanu’s struggles to find a sustained period of good health continued as she was forced to retire early in the second set of her high-profile first-round match against Bianca Andreescu in Rome with a lower back injury, an imperious Andreescu moving on after Raducanu retired as she trailed 6-2, 2-1. The retirement is naturally a concern for Raducanu leading up to the French Open, her next tournament, which begins on 22 May. Raducanu had arrived in Rome still nursing the back injury she struggled with in her run to the third round of the Madrid Open last week. During her practices in Rome, she reached for her back numerous times and her movement was limited. “Definitely disappointed with how today went,” she said. “But I guess I wanted to give it a try. I never really knew how bad it was until I kind of went out there. For me, like I’m still learning when it’s right to push my body and push through it, and when’s not. I guess that’s something I’m kind of learning at these tournaments.” The long-awaited contest between two US Open champions, played out on Grandstand, the second biggest but least attractive court in Rome, was one-sided from the beginning. Andreescu arrived on court attacking relentlessly and she maintained that intensity until the end, pressuring her opponent with brutal returning and delicate touches alike, controlling the baseline and attacking her heavy forehand relentlessly with minimal errors. Under such sustained pressure, Raducanu veered between passively dropping the ball too short or overhitting, her body language was impassive and her movement limited. After Raducanu dropped serve for 1-2 with a double fault, Andreescu battered a backhand return winner to take the second break. Down 2-5 and flailing, Raducanu took a medical timeout for her back. After a lengthy break, a measure of Andreescu’s confidence came as she calmly returned to serve out the set to love. She finished the set with 16 winners and two unforced errors, and blasted nine more winners to open the second set. Raducanu eventually put herself out of her misery, telling the umpire “I can’t move” as she retired. Despite the unsatisfying ending for Raducanu, the match still produced some constructive conclusions for her opponent. As she continues her first steps back from a six-month mental health break and a longer period filled with physical issues, Andreescu showed more glimpses of the quality and form that had marked her as one of the most hyped talents in her sport a few years ago. Both are playing through their first full clay court seasons, but for Andreescu this is particularly reflective of the injury struggles that have plagued the early years of her career. But here Andreescu is clearly building up rhythm, confidence and match fitness, and if she can remain fit then it is clear that she can mark herself as a threat for the biggest titles again. For Raducanu, the question remains what physical state she will be in for her first French Open. She has enjoyed a generally fruitful clay court season, winning matches, adapting to a surface on which she has minimal experience and appearing to enjoy her time again after a particularly difficult start to the year. But she is still constantly fighting her body. She has continually suggested that her body will eventually grow accustomed to the intensity that the sport demands of it and that it will eventually adjust. It remains to be seen how long that process will take. “For sure I need to make sure my back is fully right, however long that takes,” she said. “I need to just keep on it. I don’t want to play my next match with a feeling of limitation because I think that I learnt my lesson from this week, when to push, when not to push. Probably today wasn’t right.” Earlier on Tuesday the British No 1, Cameron Norrie, reached the second round with a 6-4, 6-4 win against Luca Nardi, a young Italian wildcard. Norrie, the ninth seed, will face Marin Cilic in the second round. Novak Djokovic, who received a first-round bye, also comfortably moved through his opening match in Rome, defeating Aslan Karatsev 6-3, 6-2 in their second-round encounter. Djokovic will face either Laslo Djere or Stan Wawrinka and he must reach the semi-final in Rome in order to keep his No 1 ranking from Daniil Medvedev going into the French Open.",Sport/Sport,Emma Raducanu’s injury woes continue in Rome exit to Bianca Andreescu,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/10/emma-raducanus-injury-woes-continue-in-rome-exit-to-bianca-andreescu
5/11/2022,"On the other side of the world, Britain’s Filipino community have not been immune to the divisions preceding the apparent landslide victory on Tuesday of Ferdinand Marcos Jr – son and namesake of the infamous ousted dictator. Even among the UK’s sizeable expatriate community – whose hundreds of thousands include many who form the backbone of Britain’s healthcare system – friends and family have split over the choice of their homeland’s new president. “I’m afraid that there are people who no longer speak to me, and when there have been community gatherings it’s clear that people have some very strong opinions,” said Araial Ilustre, a Coventry-based occupational therapist and supporter of defeated Marcos opponent Leni Robredo, who told of co-workers falling out and social media trolling. For Ilustre – whose own family history intertwined with that of the Marcos dynasty in the form of his father’s role as a senior figure in the security detail of Ferdinand senior – the election result this week is nothing short of “a regression”, fuelled in his eyes by the impact of social media. By contrast, the prevailing mood on the streets of Earl’s court – dubbed in the past as “Little Manila” on account of the Filipino presence – the prevailing mood was one of elation. On streets that are home to Filipino shops, cafes and restaurants, supporters of Marcos Jr – nicknamed “Bongbong” – wore red in support of his victory, apparently assured as unofficial results on Tuesday gave him more than 30.8m votes with more than 97% of the poll tabulated. Marcos Jr supporters included those who were not born when the politician’s father was ousted in a popular revolt that ended a brutal dictatorship, marked by thousands of extrajudicial killings and extensive use of torture. “Most people I know were supporting Marcos. It isn’t a surprise that he won but we were shocked by the gap between Leni and Bongbong,” said restaurant worker Kerry-Anne, 27. “Even though I don’t know much about him, I have spoken to my grandparents about him and they say that his dad was good back in the day – and I think they know better than me. That’s why I was supporting him.” A sense of trust in the family and a notion that he had “grown up in politics” was cited by others as a reason for their attraction towards Marcos, whose own time in the UK included a stint at Oxford University – albeit amid some controversy over whether he earned a degree. “It’s in his blood to run,” said business owner Michael Majdalena, 46. “For me, Marcos was the best candidate to win from all the candidates. He’ll be able to clear his dad’s bad reputation, we need to just give him a chance.” Salon owner, Jay, 58, went as far as expressing the view that the victory of Marcos would bring about a return of democracy back to the Philippines in the wake of strongman Rodrigo Duterte’s rule. “He’s the only qualified presidential candidate,” he says, “I believe in his aim to unify all the filipino people, no matter where they are from, the wealthy and the poor. I think Marcos is the sign of a better democracy and a more progressive Philippines.” That narrative was contested by others such as Araial Ilustre – who remembered the overthrow of Marcos senior in 1986 as a moment of hope and influential precursor to the fall some years later of the Communist dictatorships of eastern Europe. “To say we are devastated is an understatement,” admitted Mira Edgemore, who works in the UK education sector and described, with a chuckle, her activism alongside others in support of Robredo as “almost like a second job”. “We understand that democracy is very fragile, but while we process the results we are also telling ourselves that it’s a long game and there’s so much to take from the campaign. “Robredo started out from a very low base, not even as the principal challenger, and we have effectively been fighting against a decade of revisionism and rebranding about what the Marcos family stood for. We’re not going to give up.”",News/World news,‘Strong opinions’: how Marcos Jr victory has divided UK Filipinos,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/strong-opinions-how-marcos-jr-victory-has-divided-uk-filipinos
5/11/2022,"On the face of it this looks like the most basic piece of maths. Here is a move that can never be the wrong move. When life gives you lemons, sign Erling Haaland. When your squad doesn’t have a first-team player whose chief skill is scoring goals, sign Erling Haaland. When six years of careful team-building brings you a Champions League semi-final exit with 31 shots at goal: sign Erling Haaland. To date Haaland’s career has been a kind of extended marketing programme, a showcase for his preternatural ability to do exactly this. Here we have the cheat code player, a bolt-on goal-guarantee, the footballer as one-punch knockout artist. Manchester City want a goalscorer. Haaland is goals, a footballer who has pared back his role to the pursuit of football’s most basic unit. What could possibly go wrong? Except, of course, this is still a dazzlingly complex sport, an interlocking of endless additions and subtractions. Teams can be brittle, high-spec things. Dig a little and the signing of Haaland is something of a departure for Pep Guardiola, even quite a reckless tactical move. Or at least one that will require a degree of applied intelligence on both side. Haaland has become a far more complete player in the past two seasons. But the fact remains, a player who could have gone anywhere has signed for a coach who will instantly set about trying to change him. City have signed the one A-list goalscorer who looks an undeniably awkward fit. This is not to suggest the move will be a failure. That would be nuts. This is a mouthwatering prospect. Guardiola is a great coach who will work like a maniac to make this fit. Haaland is a grand, generational talent but also a modern, fully briefed, academy-reared footballer. Talent plus talent solves most problems. But it is also a first on various levels: the first time City have simply gone out and bought a fantasy player, a next-best in the world, their Neymar. As ever with City it has still been smart business. The release clause transfer fee makes that part of the deal a bargain. Factor in the full range of slices, fees, top-ups, and upfront lump sums, and it’s pretty clear this is what you might call an Uncle Monty deal: very expensive to those who can’t afford it; good business for those who can. The finances will look after themselves. The real gamble here, the real point of interest, is tactical. You have to hand it to Pep. He has gone all in. This is not a hedge or a fudge. Rather than shivering awkwardly on the edge of the swimming pool, he has instead jumped right in fully clothed and bombed the shallow end, signing not just a goalscorer, but a 100% pure uncut goalscorer. “Un mercato en folie pour les buteurs,” was Le Parisien’s take on a market going crazy for goalscorers, with moves lined up for Haaland, Kylian Mbappé and Robert Lewandowski. But of these only Mbappé is in the clearest sense an out-and-out buteur, a striker whose skills are honed to a fine point. At the end of which the team that obsess most over possession have signed a star player whose one weakness is his ability to keep possession. The manager who gave us the modern passing game has signed a striker whose passing is the least developed part of his game. Guardiola is often accused of being overly fixated on his own methods. To his credit, he is well out of his comfort zone here. This is not to suggest Haaland is a monomaniac goal obsessive. On Whoscored.com’s list of Europe’s current top 10 goalscorers he’s fifth on assists. He loses the ball less than Lewandowski, Mohamed Salah and Mbappé. Most of his goals (15 of 21 in the league) have been scored with his left foot, but that showreel of one-touch finishes and neat little runs suggests his movement fits with the way City like to attack. Then, there’s the other stuff, the data flags. Haaland doesn’t just make fewer passes than any other leading goalscorer in Europe. He’s miles back. Karim Benzema makes 41 passes per 90 minutes, Mbappé 38.9, Salah 35, Cristiano Ronaldo 32.4. Haaland is right down there on 22, ranked 129th out of 193 attacking players in the top five leagues to have played more than 18 games. Among players who have filled that slot for City this season, Phil Foden completes 40.5 passes per 90 minutes, Gabriel Jesus 36, Raheem Sterling 35, Jack Grealish 41.6. Haaland has one (yes: one) accurate long pass in the Bundesliga this season. Foden has attempted 26 of these, Jesus 22. Haaland hasn’t made a single accurate cross. Mbappé has 19 of them. Haaland will improve, and play differently in a different team. But this is still a massive disparity with other top players. The point here is simply that one side of this equation will have to change. Either Haaland adapts to fit the style, and there is no reason to assume he can’t (or indeed, as yet, no reason to suggest he can either). Or City successfully adapt a system that, while it lacks a pure finisher, is based almost entirely on working that overload of passing players in midfield and attack. It is certainly a select club that Haaland is joining. Guardiola hasn’t signed a specialist goalscorer since Jesus in 2016. Before that the complete list in 16 years as a head coach reads: Lewandowski, David Villa and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. But his record of working with goalscorers is also phenomenal. Lionel Messi scored 30 league goals in two and half seasons pre-Pep, and 88 in his next three under Pep, glossed and tweaked into the prefect modern day false 9. Sergio Agüero scored more goals under Pep than before Pep. A poacher who looked a poor fit at first enjoyed the best years of his career under the great midfield obsessive. This seems to be about will and character as much as anything else. Thierry Henry has talked about the way everything in this system is based on subjugating the ego, keeping to your position, allowing the rest of the team to set patterns, to accept the game will be won this way, not your way. The early fallings out with Ibrahimovic and Samuel Eto’o were mired in talk of disrespect and the like, Guardiola refusing to bend to the needs of big-ego players, seeing only his own team-building zeal. Haaland will know all this of course. City and Pep will have done their own thorough due diligence. Plus Guardiola knows better than anyone that teams evolve, that Haaland brings his own edge and energy, that this can be a moment of addition not dilution. Both parties have a rare free summer to work at it, to find those new shapes and patterns. A simple sum in so many ways; but also endlessly complex.",Sport/Football,Erling Haaland to Manchester City is a tactical gamble that might just pay off | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/10/erling-haaland-to-manchester-city-is-a-tactical-gamble-that-might-just-pay-off
5/11/2022,"There had been no time to reprint the official souvenir programme, so the front page read: “The ceremonial to be observed at the opening of parliament by Her Majesty the Queen.” Except the Queen was nowhere to be seen as her 96 years had caught up with her and she had decided enough was enough. For now at least, though no one was counting on her reprising the role that she had performed at every state opening since 1963 when she was pregnant with Prince Edward. So this was quite the moment for the House of Lords and royal watchers. If not for Boris Johnson and his government. By any standards theirs was a Queen’s speech devoid of imagination and ideas. All the more so when the country is on its knees. Prince Charles and Prince William duly shuffled in behind the Rouge Dragon Pursuivant, the Clarenceux King of Arms and various other members of the aristocracy who had been let loose in the dressing up box. With minimal fuss the Commons was summoned and, on their way over to the Lords, The Convict and Keir Starmer appeared to enjoy a surprisingly jolly conversation. “What are you going down for?”, “I done nuffink. I was fitted up”, “Me neither”. That sort of thing. Prison talk. Then came the speech itself and Charles couldn’t have sounded more bored. A chip off the old block. His mother must be proud. She has a long record of making her disenchantment with the current bunch of politicians plain with a dull, monotone delivery. An objectivity laced with contempt. Her Majesty’s government will … Well, what would it do? Almost certainly nothing to address the cost of living. The current bunch were more interested in fighting culture wars than in making sure people could afford to eat. Her Majesty’s government will … Make sure that every child fulfils its potential. Some hope. Charles was well over 70 and nowhere close to fulfilling his. Though today was a step in the right direction. As for the bill of rights, this was the first one to impose restrictions on its citizens. More a bill of wrongs. Charles lapsed into silence, the whole event drifting into anticlimax. There was nothing here for anyone to get excited by. A couple of hours later the Commons reconvened for the first session of the new parliament and Lindsay Hoyle began proceedings by reminding members of how they were expected to behave. If anyone misled MPs inadvertently they should be sure to correct the record at the soonest available opportunity. The Convict nodded his head enthusiastically. It was clearly still just fine to deliberately mislead the house. So no need to stop lying. He was also cheered to discover that the Speaker was pressing the reset button and that all previous offences would be considered null and void. Now for the Metropolitan police to follow suit. Then came the two traditional government backbench speeches – one from an MP considered to be past it and the other from an MP thought to be on the way up – which begin every parliament and by and large they delivered on the brief. They were jolly enough and mercifully short. Graham Stuart played the thankless old duffer card and got in one good dig at the Labour leader, saying the only thing going up for Starmer in the north was a police investigation. His korma gag fell flat. All the curry puns have been done to death in the past few weeks by the rightwing tabloids. Time for some new material all round. Fay Jones took the role of the young upstart and just about fell the right side of entertaining. Though it was closer than she might have hoped. Long before the end she had lost the attention of many in the chamber. It’s a tough gig. Still, Stuart and Jones turned out to be a glittering high spot of the day compared with what followed. Next up were the leaders of the two main parties. Starmer began well enough with a reminder to Johnson that he was the first prime minister to have a Labour council, along with tributes to David Amess, James Brokenshire and Jack Dromey, who had died in the last parliament. But after that, he never really got out of second gear. Even his gags had punchlines that were telegraphed well in advance. It was as if the Beergate allegations had finally got to Starmer and he was sleep-walking through his speech. Hamstrung by his inability to attack The Convict’s integrity. He got all the right material in – the cost of living crisis, inflation and the Tories’ seemingly abject cluelessness: they know they don’t know what they’re doing, but just don’t give a toss providing they are the ones in charge of doing nothing about it – but just not in the right order. He went on and on about “a government of the moment” but no one was listening. Least of all on his own benches. He’ll need to up his game. Much more of this and some of his MPs will begin to hope he does get a fine so they can get a leader who doesn’t just have integrity but is inspirational with it. It was some comfort to Starmer, though, that The Convict was just as poor. He knew there was nothing of any substance to deal with the cost of living crisis in the Queen’s speech and he couldn’t even be bothered to conceal it. Who cared? Certainly not his MPs. He did briefly threaten an emergency budget before Number 10 had to confirm there were no immediate plans for one after all. He also lied about Labour’s immigration plans under Tony Blair. Start as you mean to go on. The Convict then appeared to get bored by his own speech and raced to a garbled finish. The words began to spew out in an unintelligible jumble and he didn’t even attempt to look apologetic. He just seemed knackered and washed out. Maybe Partygate is getting to him too. Not enough for him to do the honourable thing and resign, but enough to be causing him psychological disturbance. Even a narcissistic sociopath has a bad day. Labour took to trying to make interventions. To help them stay awake as much as anything. By far the most impressive speech came from Theresa May, who reminded the government and the DUP that they had both signed up to the Northern Ireland protocol and were bound to comply with it. She also lamented the lack of an employment bill. We’ve reached a point where the Maybot is a lone voice of morality. When she was prime minister, she was hopelessly incompetent. But at least she was useless for the best of motives. Now we’re in the political badlands. I miss her.",News/Politics,Charles’s Queen’s speech surpassed in dullness by Starmer-Johnson show,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/10/charless-queens-speech-surpassed-in-dullness-by-starmer-johnson-show
5/11/2022,"A federal judge in Cleveland has begun hearing demands that three of the largest pharmacy chains in the US pay billions of dollars in restitution after a jury found they helped drive America’s opioid epidemic. The size of the award against CVS, Walgreens and Walmart for recklessly dispensing narcotic painkillers in two Ohio counties will help decide the total payout in thousands of federal cases across the country involving drug makers, distributors and pharmacies accused of enabling a drug epidemic that has claimed more than one million lives over two decades. The hearing began after the criminal convictions of scores of doctors who were the leading prescribers for the US’s largest manufacturer of opioids, Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals. The Washington Post reported that 65 of the company’s 239 top pain pill prescribers in 2013, at the peak of the prescription opioid epidemic, have been imprisoned, fined or lost their medical licenses. Mallinckrodt at one point accounted for the single largest share of the high potency opioid pill market, taking over from Purdue Pharma, which manufactured OxyContin, the drug that kickstarted the epidemic after its release in 1997. According to documents and depositions made public as part of a legal settlement, Mallinckrodt joined other opioid manufacturers in pushing doctors who were already prescribing large amounts of narcotics to give patients even more drugs and at higher doses while severely underplaying the risks of addiction. Several of those doctors were arrested for running “pill mill” pain clinics that dispensed opioids without following proper medical procedure, fraud and other crimes. Among them was Fathalla Mashali, who ran four clinics in Massachusetts and Rhode Island where his employees had already complained to the authorities about his “unprofessional, unethical, and unlawful behaviour”. Mashali was arrested while attempting to leave the country and in 2018 was sentenced to eight years in federal prison. Another was George Griffin, a doctor who Mallinckrodt’s sales force valued for his prolific opioid prescribing and who was sent to prison last year for illegally distributing narcotics. The decision by the court in Cleveland centers on two Ohio counties, Lake and Trumbull, that are part of a bellwether federal case deciding the degree of culpability and amount of payouts for thousands of opioid lawsuits filed by municipalities, counties and Indigenous tribes across the country. Lawyers for the Ohio counties have said that each needs at least $1bn to deal with the fallout of opioid addiction and deaths. Those attorneys contend that about 400 pain pills were dispensed for every resident of Trumbull county when mass prescribing of opioids was at its worst. The parties in another bellwether trial involving distributors accused of illegally flooding West Virginia with opioids – driving the nation’s highest overdose rate – are awaiting a verdict. According to evidence presented during the trial, pharmaceutical executives circulated emails mocking “pillbillies” who became addicted to painkillers. Another prominent case set to be heard stems from a lawsuit by the Cherokee Nation against the drug distributor McKesson. But shocking revelations about the greed and cynicism of opioid makers such as Mallinckrodt, Purdue Pharma and Johnson & Johnson during the lawsuits’ discovery phases have increasingly pushed drug manufacturers, distributors and pharmacy chains to settle without going to trial. Collectively, so far, they have agreed to more than $40bn in payments, albeit without admitting wrongdoing. Earlier this month, CVS and Walgreens agreed to pay Florida hundreds of millions to settle claims over opioid dispensing. Last year, Johnson & Johnson announced it would stop manufacturing opioid painkillers after litigation uncovered disdain for patients among its sales force. In one company memo, a sales representative said she dismissed a doctor’s fears that patients might become addicted to opioids by telling him those who didn’t die probably wouldn’t get hooked.",News/US news,Ohio judge hears if pharmacy chains should pay for driving opioid crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/10/opioid-crisis-pharmacy-cvs-walmart-walgreens
5/11/2022,"The longer the war in Ukraine carries on, the worse the consequences will be for the climate, the US presidential envoy John Kerry has warned. Many countries are struggling with an energy crisis while also urgently needing to cut greenhouse gas emissions to limit global heating to 1.5C, he said. “If it’s a long period of time, obviously that makes [staying within 1.5C] very complicated,” Kerry said. “It depends on what happens with the war, where the war goes and how long it lasts. If miraculously we can somehow find a way to resolve some of the fundamental problems in the next six months, then maybe we could just accelerate everything together. I think we can make up some distance [in progress on tackling the climate crisis].” But he added: “The longer this goes on, the harder it becomes [to stay within 1.5C]. There are a number of scientists who believe we are on the edge of 1.5C now. Anything that is not part of the acceleration [of emissions-cutting efforts] gets in the way.” He said the agreement reached at the UN Cop26 climate summit last year would have “faced some big hurdles” if taking place in the current geopolitical circumstances, but there was still a chance of fulfilling its promises. “This is not easy, but it hasn’t fallen apart,” he told the Guardian. “[The effort to stay within 1.5C] has met with an unexpected barrier, the war, and it has met with an unfortunate and dangerous resurgence of business as usual by some parties that threatens the acceleration necessary to get the job done, and it’s going to be up to us to push back and continue with the process.” The world’s leading climate scientists recently warned it was “now or never” for the world to cut greenhouse gas emissions and avoid the worst ravages of the climate crisis. Kerry said this showed there was still a chance of holding to the 1.5C goal. “The IPCC said to us a few weeks ago ‘we’re behind, it’s not getting better at the pace it should be, emissions have gone up, but you still have time to do this’,” he said. “And my message to people is we have to take advantage of the fact that the science tells us we still have time, but we have to greatly accelerate what we’re doing. We have to speed up very significantly.” He said the disruption caused by the Ukraine war was forcing countries to reconsider their dependence on fossil fuels. “The promises of Cop26 were never going to be fulfilled in six months, or one year or two years. These are promises for 2030. A hiccup of a number of months may be something that we can work around or get through.” Kerry also said the US would increase its production of natural gas, despite its climate targets, to help allies replace Russian fossil fuels. He said gas from the US produced lower carbon emissions than gas from Russia, owing to more efficient extraction, and could provide a short-term solution while countries ramp up renewable energy. The US president, Joe Biden, has come under heavy criticism from green campaigners in the US for allowing the expansion of gas drilling, opening up new tracts of public land for exploration and development. Kerry said more gas was needed in the short term, to make up for supplies lost from Russia, but that companies should beware of building large amounts of new gas infrastructure that would be left as stranded assets when the energy crisis passes. “Gas has always been part of the transition away from dirtier fossil fuels and towards this new energy economy,” he said. “I’d take a gas-fired power plant in the near term – I emphasise near term – over coal or oil any day of the week. But we don’t want to build out a huge new infrastructure around gas that has stranded asset challenges or is unabated [not fitted with technology to capture and store carbon] after a number of years.” He hinted at moves to limit how long such plants could operate. “We have to decide how quickly we must have a requisite for abatement – maybe 10 years, eight years, who knows? But for the long run, gas is going to have to abate and live up to low emissions standards just like everybody else,” he said. With six months to go before the next UN climate summit, Cop27 in Egypt, Kerry said the focus must be on the G20 countries, the world’s 20 biggest economies, which are responsible for about 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The emissions-cutting plans these countries brought to Cop26 were inadequate to meet the 1.5C target, so they have been asked to come to Egypt this November with more stringent proposals. Kerry acknowledged that many countries were unlikely to meet the targets, including Russia, which is one of the biggest fossil fuel producers. He warned some countries were “indifferent” to the need to cut emissions, or have vested interests in not doing so. “The war is not the only thing that’s in the way of the acceleration – an unfortunate indifference in some quarters, outright disinformation in others, and people who just love the status quo is perhaps one of our biggest problems,” he said. But there were hopes that major emitters including China and India were embracing change, he added. “We’re prepared to try to help China or provide whatever China is willing to accept in terms of assistance.” He also pointed to India, currently suffering a massive heatwave, where a large expansion of renewable energy is planned that could enable the country to cut emissions in line with a global 1.5C temperature goal. Kerry said he was hopeful that the climate legislation currently stuck in Congress, largely because of the refusal of a single Democratic senator to pass it, would soon be resolved. He said other countries were unlikely to be discouraged from taking action themselves by the US’s own internal difficulties. “Maybe they’ll say ‘screw them, they can’t get their act together, we’re going to do it’,” he said. “I can’t predict, but I can tell you this: that President Biden is committed to moving forward and obviously he has administrative powers and can issue certain executive orders and do certain things. “Even while Donald Trump was president, pulled out of Paris, 75% of the new power that came online in the US was renewable. So the truth is that a lot of what happens in the US will be governed locally and some nationally by governors of states and mayors of cities who are deeply committed.”",News/Environment,John Kerry warns a long Ukraine war would threaten climate efforts,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/10/john-kerry-warns-long-ukraine-war-threaten-climate-efforts
5/11/2022,"Price increases driven by Brexit, Covid supply disruptions and war-driven commodity shocks are one matter. The heavy costs – unemployment, wage squeezes, poverty – that follow from a combination of rising interest rates, privatisation and public spending restraint are another. Yet the Queen’s speech, in which the government presents its programme for the next session of parliament, reveals that Boris Johnson appears to have little compunction in inflicting the second set of costs on top of the first. Mr Johnson claims that he will tackle the cost of living crisis by “grow[ing] the economy”. But he presented nothing on Tuesday that would do so. The prime minister has failed to redeem similar promises before. This is a pivotal moment for an unpopular leader. Voters want to know what the government will do to help them when they are in need. The problem for Mr Johnson is that the current economic shock threatens to persuade the public that society ought to move in a different direction from the one in which he wants to drive it. Most people support Labour’s idea of levying windfall taxes on energy firms to help those struggling with bills. The more severe this spell of low growth and high inflation, the stronger the urge for such policies. Yet instead of dealing with the very real economic problems confronting the country, Mr Johnson’s legislative programme creates political divisions with opponents. When an issue divides his party, such as net zero climate policies, the prime minister has nothing to say. Mr Johnson wants not to govern, but to mobilise the Conservative party’s core vote. In the Queen’s speech there were Brussels-bashing laws to frame his opponents as inveterate remainers. The government will bring forward a public order bill, to restrict demonstrations and cast environmental civil disobedience as “watermelon” protests – green on the outside but subcutaneously red. Replacing the Human Rights Act with a bill of rights is more an attempt to pick a bare-knuckle fight with liberal lawyers than a workable plan. Levelling up is the slogan supposed to define Mr Johnson’s premiership. Yet the flagship bill centres on a duty for ministers to produce a yearly progress report on how well they are doing in meeting 12 vague targets such as “restoring local pride”. There is no new cash to help regions and the dozen missions appear unambitious goals to be met by 2030. “Red wall” voters who “loaned” Mr Johnson their support in 2019 want help now – not years away. The Conservative party has been in power since 2010. It has pursued a policy of promoting the interests of owners of capital over labour. From 2008 to 2020, wages have stagnated but the top 10% most profitable firms were able to raise mark-ups – the difference between the price of a good and its marginal cost – from 58% to 82%. While market power grows, state capacity diminishes. With lengthening waiting lists, public satisfaction in the NHS has nosedived to 36%, down from a high of 70% in 2010. In schools, pupil funding fell by 9% in the decade before 2020 and it will be the mid-2020s before it recovers to 2010 levels. The courts system is under huge pressure, with about a fifth less cash than a decade ago. The Tories came to power claiming Britain was broken. In fact it was the next decade that broke Britain – and Mr Johnson has no plans to fix it.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the Queen’s speech: Boris Johnson fails to deliver for voters | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/10/the-guardian-view-on-the-queens-speech-boris-johnson-fails-to-deliver-for-voters
5/11/2022,"My father, Bill Goodhand, who has died aged 87, was a local historian, a champion of local politics and a strong supporter of the idea that small is beautiful. He was born in Louth, Lincolnshire, to Ethel (nee Evison) and Don Goodhand, a railway signalman. From the City school, Lincoln, he went to Birmingham University, gaining a geography degree (1955) and then taking a teaching qualification. His first post was at Bishop Vesey’s grammar school in Sutton Coldfield. In 1958 he married Marion Mableson, and they set off for Australia as “£10 Poms”, settling in Tasmania, where Bill was a geography lecturer at Hobart University. They had two sons in Tasmania before in 1963 returning to the UK, where their daughter was born the following year. The family moved to a farm in Welbourn, Lincolnshire, in 1969, when Bill became a geography lecturer at Bishop Grosseteste Teacher Training College (now Bishop Grosseteste University), remaining there until he took early retirement in 1991. Mill Farm was in bad repair and was to become a long-term project, as well as a much-loved family home, for the next five decades. Bill immersed himself in village affairs and became chair of the parish council, serving for 30 years. Left-leaning, Guardian-reading and widely travelled, he was proud to be considered a Lincolnshire “yeller belly”. He was also quiet, modest and fair-minded, which helped him balance different sets of interests and pressures within the village. Among the numerous community initiatives he was involved in were the acquisition, with lottery funding, of Castle Hill – the site of a Norman motte and bailey castle in the village – as a public resource; the renovation and purchase of the village blacksmith’s forge; the preparation of the neighbourhood plan; and working with landowners to establish field path walks around the village. He had a vast knowledge of village history and co-authored a book detailing the life of Welbourn-born Sir William Robertson (who rose from the rank of private to field marshal in the British army). He was a founding member of the National Association of Small Schools, which fought to protect small schools from closure, and a longstanding chair of governors for Welbourn primary school, where Marion was a teacher. In recognition of their civic roles, Bill and Marion were named Lincolnshire citizens of the year in 2014. Bill is survived by Marion, his children, Simon, Sarah and me, seven grandchildren and his sister, Jenny.",News/Politics,Bill Goodhand obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/10/bill-goodhand-obituary
