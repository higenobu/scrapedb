2/19/2022,"Andy Burnham has hit out at critics of Greater Manchester’s clean air zone (CAZ) whom he says have made “frankly disgraceful” false claims about his wife’s professional links to an electric car charging network. The Greater Manchester mayor accuses opponents of the CAZ of spreading false information about Marie-France van Heel, a marketing executive who married Burnham in 2000.  Van Heel is the strategy director and managing partner of a small marketing and brand agency, Heavenly. One of her clients is Be.EV, which has a contract with Transport for Greater Manchester to maintain and grow the region’s electric vehicle charging network. Burnham declared this at a Greater Manchester combined authority (GMCA) meeting in September 2021, recusing himself from a discussion of the region’s electric vehicle charging infrastructure strategy so that he was not part of the decision-making. But as opposition to the CAZ has grown, Van Heel’s relationship to Be.EV has been widely exaggerated online in order to suggest the Burnham family will personally profit if owners of polluting vehicles switch to electric cars as a result of the CAZ. There have been widely shared false claims that the couple own shares in Be.EV, that Van Heel will receive bonuses from the firm if their profits increase as a result of the CAZ, and that she has a financial interest in the cameras used to monitor vehicles entering the zone. The scheme, which would impose daily charges on some high-emission vehicles, excluding private cars, had been due to begin at the end of May. In 2017 the government ordered Greater Manchester to clean up illegal levels of air pollution after clean air campaigners won a case at the supreme court in 2017. Along with a number of other urban areas, it was told to use a charging zone as the “default option” in order to encourage people to scrap polluting vehicles. Despite the order coming from the Conservative government, Tory MPs and even Boris Johnson have become loud opponents of the Greater Manchester CAZ. At prime minister’s questions on 2 February, the prime minister said: “It has become clear that the scheme proposed by the Labour mayor in Manchester is completely unworkable and will do more damage to businesses and residents in Manchester.” Shortly afterwards the government agreed to delay the CAZ until July, after the GMCA presented evidence to the government showing that the impact of issues such as Covid-19 on supply chains and the price and availability of secondhand vehicles will make it harder for people to upgrade to cleaner vehicles. In the past year CAZs have launched in Birmingham, Bath and Portsmouth, with others schemes set for Bradford and Bristol by the end of the year. In a statement on Friday, Burnham explained why he declared his wife’s connection to Be.EV: “Even though this is a minor private interest in relation to EV charging – and not directly related to the CAZ – I still chose to declare it, and remove myself from any decision-making, so that there could be no perception of a conflict of interest nor any suggestion of privileged information being misused. More broadly, we do not own any shares in any company and receive no income other than our salaries. Given this, some of the claims that have been made about my wife are frankly disgraceful.”",News/Environment,Andy Burnham says clean air zone critics made false claims about wife’s interests,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/18/andy-burnham-says-clean-air-zone-critics-made-false-claims-about-wifes-interests
2/19/2022,"The trial of constable Zachary Rolfe has been running for the past two weeks in Darwin and is expected to run for at least another fortnight. Rolfe is charged with murdering Indigenous man Kumanjayi Walker in the remote community of Yuendumu, about 300km from Alice Springs, in November 2019.  He has pleaded not guilty to murder and alternate charges. Here is what the court has heard during the trial. The court has heard Rolfe shot Walker three times at a property known as House 511 in Yuendumu at about 7.20pm on 9 November 2019. He had been trying to arrest Walker, a 19-year-old Warlpiri man, in relation to an outstanding warrant. More evidence about the shooting was revealed when Justice John Burns amended previous suppression orders preventing the publication of body-worn camera footage of the shooting played to the court and of detailed descriptions of that footage. Rolfe’s defence does not dispute that he shot Walker – what is in dispute is whether two of those shots were justified in the circumstances. In his opening address, the prosecutor, Phillip Strickland SC, took the jury through body-worn camera footage of the incident. He said Rolfe and fellow constable Adam Eberl had entered House 511 looking for Walker and found him walking towards them. The officers entered via the only working door to the property, meaning Walker could not escape, Strickland said. Strickland said Rolfe and Eberl ushered Walker to his right so his back was against the wall and the officers were in front of him. Rolfe then held his mobile phone, which had a photo of Walker on it, against the right side of Walker’s face, to confirm his identity. Soon after, he asked Walker to put his hands behind his back. But Walker took a pair of surgical scissors from his pocket and brought them down in a stabbing motion into Rolfe’s left shoulder, the prosecutor said. Strickland said Eberl and Walker struggled towards the other side of the room and Rolfe fired his first shot, hitting Walker in the middle of the back, while the 19-year-old was standing about a metre away. Strickland has told the court that Walker then either fell or was wrestled to the ground by Eberl, who he described as physically larger than Walker. The pair then struggled on a mattress. Strickland told the court Eberl gained control of Walker, who he said was lying on his front and side, with Walker’s right arm – which had been holding the scissors – pinned underneath him. David Edwardson QC, for Rolfe, disputes that Eberl was in control at this time. The prosecution says Rolfe walked across the room to the couple, placed his left hand on Eberl’s back, and, while standing above Walker, extended his right arm, which was holding his Glock semi-automatic handgun. He pulled the trigger twice more when the barrel of the gun was so close to Walker’s body that it may have been touching it, Strickland said. According to Strickland, the second shot was fired 2.6 seconds after the first shot and 0.5 seconds before the third. Rolfe is charged in relation to the second and third shots. Edwardson said Rolfe would defend his actions as being reasonable and justifiable in the context of the danger faced by him and Eberl. He said Rolfe was acting in self-defence and to defend the life of Eberl when he fired the second and third shots – and his actions were supported by his training. The barrister cautioned the jury against placing too much weight on the footage – especially when being shown it multiple times. Edwardson argued Walker had a propensity for violence, having threatened different officers with an axe days earlier, and had attacked Rolfe in a dark and confined space. Rolfe “did not have the luxury of considering tactical options frame by frame”, Edwardson told the court. “He could not press the pause button.” Strickland says the prosecution case was not confined to Rolfe’s actions during the shooting but the context in which it took place. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The trial has heard evidence about what information was provided to Rolfe and his four colleagues from Alice Springs before they travelled to Yuendumu on 9 November 2019. The prosecution argues that evidence – and what the officers knew before they left Yuendumu police station – is essential for establishing the shooting’s context. They argue that the attempt to arrest Walker on the night he was shot was inconsistent with a plan to arrest him the following day. Sgt Julie Frost, the officer in charge of Yuendumu station, gave evidence that an email described as the operational plan was sent to four of the officers and other police about two hours before they arrived in Yuendumu. But the officers were already on their way from Alice Springs and would not have had mobile phone reception to check their emails for most of the journey, the court heard. Frost says she anticipated this and printed out copies for the officers, which she made available at the station when they arrived. She says she gave the officers a briefing about the contents of the plan, which included details of their duties that night, and mentioned the officers would meet back at the station at 5am the following day to prepare for Walker’s arrest. Two of the Alice Springs-based officers who were in the five-minute briefing and have given evidence, however, recall few details of the briefing and have denied seeing the plan prepared by Frost. Another officer, the dog handler Adam Donaldson, who arrived before the four officers from the Immediate Response Team (IRT) which included Rolfe, said he was given a copy of the plan by Frost.

She had told his family and community elders that he should hand himself in, and given him until after a funeral to be held in the community on 9 November to do so, but did not believe he would surrender. She said she had told the officers they should gather intelligence on where Walker was while they were patrolling the community on the night of 9 November and that if they came across him that night they should arrest him. Edwardson says the plan, even if it had have been seen by the officers, contained multiple flaws, including that it mentioned their deployment was not expected until 11pm (about four hours after they were actually ready to deploy) and that there was no intelligence about Walker’s location, meaning he could not be arrested the following morning as police did not know where he was. He has also sought to emphasise that in policing all plans need to be fluid to respond to changing circumstances. Regardless of what the officers knew before leaving the Yuendumu station, one thing is not in dispute: 15 minutes later Walker was shot. The prosecution alleges Rolfe acted against his training by drawing his gun while clearing a house during an earlier search for Walker; by allegedly failing to issue verbal commands during his confrontation with Walker; in how he used his weapon during this confrontation, and, along with the other officers involved, by not using cordon and contain techniques once they learned where Walker could be on the night of the shooting. Eberl, the prosecution alleges, was gaining “ground control” of Walker, as he had been trained to do, when Rolfe fired the second and third shots. As a member of the IRT, Rolfe had received more weapons and tactical training than general duties officers. The defence also considers police training to be important in the case, for different reasons. “He made a split-second decision to fire shots two and three, as we suggest, consistent with his training, he was required to do,” Edwardson said on the second day of the trial. Most police witnesses, of which there have been more than a dozen, have been asked by Edwardson about whether they were familiar with the phrase “edged weapon equals gun”, meaning police can draw their firearms once someone presents an edged weapon. They have also been asked about training in relation to the safe distance they should try to maintain from a subject with an edged weapon. Edwardson has also asked about training in relation to where officers are told to shoot offenders – at the central body mass. The court has heard evidence about Walker’s final days in Yuendumu, including from several family members who say he told them he planned to surrender. Eddie Robertson, the grandfather of Walker’s partner, Rickisha Robertson, and a respected local elder, said he told Walker after the axe incident on 6 November that he had to surrender. Walker, who the court has heard was quietly spoken, nodded in response, Robertson said at the trial. Louanna Williams, Walker’s aunt, said he also visited her after the axe incident and told her he planned to hand himself in after the funeral of a family member. She said Walker also told her he was “comfortable” having her brother, senior Aboriginal community police officer Derek Williams – who was not involved in the events around Walker’s death – arrest him and that he denied any involvement in a series of break-ins in Yuendumu. Local police suspected Walker had been involved in the break-ins which had prompted medical staff to leave the town. The break-ins and evacuation were both among the reasons used to justify the deployment of Rolfe and other officers from Alice Springs. The funeral was for the uncle of Leanne Oldfield, Walker’s adopted mother. Oldfield told the court that minutes before the shooting, she had been sitting outside House 511. She said Walker had been looking at a family photo of his cousins and an aunt in a swimming pool and laughing, she said, before he went inside the property. “Soon as he went inside, I seen the police coming through the gate,” Oldfield told the court.",News/Australia news,Zachary Rolfe trial: What the court has heard so far about the shooting of Kumanjayi Walker,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/19/zachary-rolfe-trial-what-the-court-has-heard-so-far-about-the-shooting-of-kumanjayi-walker
2/19/2022,"Three months, at most, from the next federal election, the seat of Hughes, in Sydney’s Sutherland shire, should be a prime target for the New South Wales Liberal party. After Craig Kelly’s defection to the United Australia party, the seat, which the Liberals won with a 10% margin in 2019, became a key battleground. In a normal year, the party would already have a high-quality candidate knocking on doors and nodding encouragingly behind Scott Morrison at press conferences.  Instead, this year, there’s no one. Kelly has renominated to run for the UAP, spending Clive Palmer’s money freely on newspaper and television advertisements, as have a handful of independents and Peter Tsambalas for the Labor party. The story of a missing Liberal candidate is repeated in a clutch of key seats across the state. In Dobell on the Central Coast, Tony Abbott’s former seat of Warringah, Parramatta in Sydney’s west, and also Bennelong, Eden Monaro and the party’s key NSW Senate spots. It’s not for a lack of trying. For months, the party’s NSW executive has, with increased urgency, tried to hash out a preselection deal which would finally get candidates on the ground. It hasn’t worked. An increasingly toxic factional standoff between the party’s competing tribes has turned the division into a morass, prompting threats of intervention from the prime minister and the prospect of a damaging supreme court battle. “I’m no longer optimistic we can get anything done,” one senior Liberal party source told the Guardian this week. Unpicking the factional grievances at play in NSW requires both a PhD in internal Liberal party politics and a lot of spare time, but at its heart, predictably, is power, as well as a handful of administrative rules introduced in 2017 with the intention of making the party more democratic. The so-called “Warringah rules”, championed by Abbott after he was rolled by Malcolm Turnbull as prime minister, introduced what was called a “one member one vote” rule, essentially creating local plebiscites in preselection ballots. The rules were aimed at making the party more democratic, while also making it harder for the state executive to overrule branches by requiring a 90% voting threshold to use its special powers to install candidates. “We didn’t like the insiders club, the closed shop which the NSW Liberal party has been for too long,” Abbott said at the time. “We will do even greater things now that we’ve got this mandate to be a genuine people’s party.” But by failing to protect sitting MPs, the rules have created a headache for Morrison in the lead-up to the election. Two ministers, Sussan Ley in Farrer and Alex Hawke in the Sydney seat of Mitchell, are yet to be endorsed, as is the influential moderate in North Sydney, Trent Zimmerman. All three have faced competitors in their nominations, and have had preselections on hold because of fears they might lose a ballot of the local membership. Enter Hawke, chieftain of the party’s centre right faction, of which Morrison is a member, and a key figure inside the NSW division. For months, figures inside the party’s right and moderate factions have claimed that Hawke was not making himself available for candidate vetting, a necessary step for the party to progress to preselection. As recently as this week Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, a Liberal senator from the party’s right who is also fighting to hold on to her spot on the ticket, accused Hawke of failing to “carry out his party functions as a member of the nomination review committee in a timely manner”.

They haven’t. Instead, a rump of members in the right and moderate factions have continued to block their endorsements using the new 90% rule. The reasons are complicated and contradictory, but relate both to a desire for local preselections and a failure to settle on a deal on the other remaining seats which can appease all three groups. A series of compromise deals have been floated, including one which would see the right’s Alex Dore – a nephew of The Australian’s editor-in-chief, Chris Dore – parachuted into Hughes while dividing the spoils of the other seats and saving the three sitting MPs. None of them have yet worked. This week, the saga took another unexpected twist. At a hastily arranged meeting of the party’s executive, members were presented with legal advice stating that if it did not hold an annual meeting by the end of February they would soon be in breach of their constitution. The advice suggested federal intervention was required to reappoint members of the executive until the party’s postponed annual general meeting was held in March. But it was fiercely contested by right-faction members who have for months believed Hawke and Morrison were attempting to generate a crisis to allow the federal executive to intervene. At Wednesday’s meeting the right faction’s Matthew Camenzuli presented competing legal advice that suggested a federal intervention was unnecessary, and figures within that faction are suggesting they are willing to take legal action to block any takeover. On Thursday, the state executive came up with what they thought was a compromise, asking the federal executive to intervene in a limited fashion allowing them only to reappoint the existing state executive until it was able to hold a general meeting next month. But the federal executive, of which Morrison is a member, came back with its own proposal: endorse the three sitting MPs within 10 days or else face federal intervention. The NSW executive now faces a daunting task. Either overcome the impasse, or else face a federal takeover. While members were in discussions on Friday ahead of a likely ballot decision next week, there is hardly a consensus on a way forward. “The problem is that the 90% threshold is just so prohibitively high,” one member says. “There are people on the executive from all factions that are just completely lacking in pragmatism. They’d prefer to risk it all because they don’t like one of the candidates or they’re not getting everything they want. I’d prefer to get 80% of something than 100% of nothing.” Hawke did not respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment.",News/Australia news,"In key election battlegrounds, the Liberal party is nowhere to be seen",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/19/in-key-election-battlegrounds-the-liberal-party-is-nowhere-to-be-seen
2/19/2022,"“People know there is genuine dislike between us and that this is a real grudge match which has been waiting to happen for a very long time,” Kell Brook says as he explains why it took just 10 minutes to sell 21,000 tickets and fill every seat in the Manchester Arena for his fight against Amir Khan on Saturday night. Brook and Khan are both 35 years old and so far down the wrong side of the unforgiving boxing hill that even two such proud men don’t dispute the fact that their best days were beaten out of them by superior opponents. Khan has not fought for two and a half years and the most vivid memories from the latter stages of his career are of him being knocked out frighteningly by Saúl “Canelo” Álvarez in 2016 and being stopped by Terence Crawford three years later. The fact that Álvarez and Crawford are two of the three best pound-for-pound fighters in the world at least shows that Khan was crushed by supreme talents.  The three painful defeats on Brook’s record were between 2016 and 2020 and also against stellar opposition. His last fight, when he was stopped brutally in the fourth round by Crawford in December 2020, was not as damaging as his earlier losses to Gennady Golovkin and Errol Spence – two brilliant fighters who each broke one of Brook’s eye-sockets. It does not take long to construct a sensible argument that both Brook and Khan should have opted for retirement. Instead they finally meet in Manchester 10 years after this bout was first hyped as an unmissable contest between two bitter local rivals from the north – with Brook being from Sheffield and Khan from Bolton. When they were both on the rise they were exciting and courageous, if always vulnerable, and credit should be given to both men for all that they have achieved. Khan proved himself as a multiple world champion who brought blistering hand speed to the ring. His world title win against Marcos Maidana was boxing’s Fight of the Year in 2010, and showed that Khan was as immensely brave as he could be quick and skilful. Brook’s finest night also came in the US, in 2014, when he went to California and outpointed the excellent American Shawn Porter in a gruelling fight to become the IBF welterweight champion. He also showed great heart in facing the much bigger man in Golovkin and then the dangerous Spence in back-to-back fights which almost ruined him. There is a terrible term in boxing which describes old fighters as “damaged goods”. That phrase has been applied to Brook and Khan for years, yet here they are, on the eve of a hotly anticipated British fight with no title at stake and their reputations diminished. “People want to see this fight because it’s real intriguing,” Brook counters. “No one knows what Khan has got left and people are wondering the same about me. We’re both coming to win but he doesn’t have much of a chin and we all know it’s going to be explosive in there.” In recent weeks, when I asked a range of boxing insiders to pick the winner, the split between those backing Khan’s speed to be decisive and those who believe Brook might stop his despised rival was marginal. Eleven out of 20 went for Khan but almost everyone stressed that the win would mean even more to Brook, whose animosity has simmered for years. Brook suggests that the contest will define their legacies. “It really will. I fought for world titles and against some of the greatest fighters, and Khan had done the same, but this one means so much. I’ve trained even harder for Khan than against Porter, Golovkin and Spence. This fight means everything to me.” Khan has never shown the same enthusiasm for the contest and, over the years, he has claimed that he had far more significant fights to chase in America than a domestic dust-up which won’t much mean much outside the UK. But does Brook feel that Khan wanted to avoid losing to him because defeat to a local rival would sting so much? “You’ve hit the nail on the head,” Brook says with relish. “There was some fear in him and he never wanted to fight me.” It’s unlikely that Khan ever feared him but he has spoken disparagingly of Brook and said: “He has lived off my name for years.” “It’s just him trying to get in my head,” Brook says with a shrug. “I’ve had more than 40 fights and been tested so often – so it doesn’t bother me what he says.” The enmity has escalated in recent days. Brook mocked Khan’s “poppadum chin” and has been accused of racism. “It’s so sad that he had to come out with a comment like that,” Khan said on Thursday. “It gives me an added push to stick it on him and give him a proper beating. At the end of the day we’re fighting each other but you still have some sort of respect for him – I think that’s gone out the window now. People shouldn’t be racist.” Brook denied the allegation and said Khan is “trying to get everyone on his side and think I’m some kind of racist character when I’m not. I just meant how delicate he is. Poppadoms just break, which is the same as his chin. There’s no racial angle there at all.” Khan, in turn, has been accused of homophobia by apparently questioning Brook’s sexuality. The Bolton boxer insisted that he had not said anything homophobic. I am more interested in trying to establish the cause of the feud Brook has stoked for so long. When did he first meet Khan? “I can’t remember the exact day or time, but it must have been where we were 15. He has been on my radar so long.” Khan has said that when they sparred as amateurs he was so much better than Brook he could outbox him using just one hand. Brook rolls his eyes. “He’s very deluded. He always has been. When we first sparred I noticed how fast his hands were and it took some getting used to. But after a couple of rounds I was OK.” Did the bad blood between them start when the teenage Khan was selected for the 2004 Olympic Games where, showing extraordinary talent, he won a surprise silver medal while Brook remained in obscurity in Sheffield? “That’s not correct,” Brook says. “I come from the Brendan Ingle gym in Wincobank and we were never liked by the amateur boxing people. Herol Graham and Prince Naseem Hamed led the way and I followed their style. We did not box in that stiff way like amateur boxers …” Brook holds up his arms like a robot and grins. “We were much better but our style was more suited to the pro game. So I was never that worried about the amateurs. I’ll tell you where the bad blood started. It was when we were both at [the promoter] Frank Warren and were told that we would build the fight like it were a tree. We would be like two seeds in a pot and we would grow into branches off this tree. And when we were both strong we would meet then. But it never happened. He always avoided fighting me.” In their promotional face-offs to build the pay-per-view hype around the fight it has become clear that Brook is much more emotional than Khan. In arguing that Khan has never shown him the respect he deserves, Brook has looked wounded. He might want to win desperately on Saturday night but he needs to find a way to control his emotions. “It’s also personal for Dominic [Ingle],” he says of his trainer, “but he has been reminding me that I have to stick to our game plan. I have to be very focused and not allow emotion to get in the way. “Khan still has great speed. He has really fast hands and feet. I know he’s good. You don’t become a world champion by doing nothing. He has won world titles and he is a good boxer. But he is not at my level.” Brook must feel some concern about the damage he has suffered in the ring because Golovkin, Spence and Crawford all hurt him. “I know what you’re saying but I am close to my family and my parents will tell me when it is time to stop. I had them two bad eye injuries but I have not been in many long wars. I didn’t suffer the drawn‑out beatings or those devastating KOs Khan had against Canelo and others. He has had much more punishment than me. I also don’t get hit much in sparring and I am eating well, drinking plenty of water and in great shape.” Despite his even longer hiatus from the ring, Khan said recently that he feels lost without boxing and that he has rejuvenated himself by switching to Crawford’s camp in America. He is now trained in Nebraska and Colorado by Brian “Bomac” McIntyre who is most famous for being in Crawford’s corner. Khan claims that his fight against Brook is not merely a money-spinning one-off but that he needs to keep fighting for his own peace of mind for he does not know what else he can do outside the ring. “I agree with him,” Brook says. “I am the same. I need the discipline and structure. I get lost without it. I would be scratching my head if I didn’t have boxing. What could I do? Boxing saved me.” I have interviewed Brook twice before, when he remembered being stabbed in 2014 and how he felt suicidal in 2018. How has he been the last year? “I remember them times and I have been in dark places. The last two years have also not been easy for any of us but the discipline and structure of boxing is helping me find ways to stay out of that dark pit. I feel really good right now because Dominic has been working me so hard. Whenever a sparring partner has looked tired after a few rounds he has thrown in a new guy. I have handled them all.” Brook has struggled for years to make weight and one of his stipulations in fighting Khan was that they would weigh in at 149lb – 2lb above the welterweight limit. “The weight is always difficult,” he concedes. “It’s tough and I have a very sweet tooth. But having a few more pounds [at 149] helps so much.” He is sufficiently confident of beating Khan that he talks happily about fighting one of the best young welterweights in Britain. “I would like Conor Benn next,” Brook says of the hard-hitting 25-year‑old who comes from a famous boxing family. “He is the young kid coming up, the son of Nigel Benn, and people are talking about him. But I don’t think he’s as good as everyone is saying. I’d love that fight.” He still has to beat Khan and Brook is experienced enough to know that all the bitter words, the pushing and shoving and the years of rivalry won’t help either man once the first bell rings. “It’s a lonely place – just me and him. But we’ll find out who really is the better man after all these years. I don’t think you can take much from the press conferences and the face‑offs but from what I could see he has looked up for it. But it’s going to be very hard for him in the ring. I am going to win this one. It matters so much to me.”",Sport/Sport,Amir Khan v Kell Brook: an intriguing clash of bitter rivals in decline,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/18/amir-khan-kell-brook-boxing-preview-bitter-rivals-in-decline
2/19/2022,"In the 1990s, Australia suffered a meningococcal disease outbreak in three different jurisdictions across central Australia. “They all had different ways of dealing with it, even though in many cases there were members of the same family involved in different states and territories,” says Prof Lynn Gilbert, microbiologist and infectious diseases expert at the University of Sydney. It was back then, she says, that the need for a national disease surveillance and control agency became clear. The campaign for the creation of a national disease surveillance agency in Australia, similar to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has been going for three decades and now, after two years of Covid-19 exposing cracks in the federated health system, it’s gathering pace.The Labor party is going into the upcoming election promising to establish an Australian Centre for Disease Control (CDC), and organisations including the Australian Medical Association, Australasian Society for Infectious Diseases and the Public Health Association of Australia all say it is past time for such a body.  The pandemic has highlighted the barriers. Terry Slevin, CEO of the Public Health Association of Australia says the “fractious nature” of Australia’s different jurisdictions has “absolutely tested the system like it’s never been tested before”. Adelaide GP and federal AMA vice-president Dr Chris Moy has also been frustrated by the lack of consistency in communication between states, territories and commonwealth. “Even though we had Atagi [the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation] there who were providing good advice, really good people giving good advice, it was the communication of that,” Moy says. The constant changes and mixed messaging – including to medical practitioners about how to deal with potentially Covid-infected patients – caused confusion which Moy says reduced trust in advice from authorities. The government has considered recommendations to look into national centre for communicable diseases control within the last decade, but in 2018 let go of the idea, arguing that the “national framework” model was better. “Clearly we need an operational communicable diseases agency,” says Prof Tania Sorrell, infectious diseases physician and co-director of the University of Sydney Institute for Infectious Diseases. But what would that look like? “There are various models, and the actual terminology of what people mean by CDC is not the same in different places.” The US CDC itself is a massive organisation, with a total budget for 2022 of US$15.4bn, more than 10,000 employees, and in excess of 200 laboratories across the US. Its role is to collect national data on both infectious and non-infectious – communicable and non-communicable – diseases, perform ongoing surveillance, research, diagnostic testing, advise governments, and train the US’s public health workforce. It is funded by the US government but – particularly during the Trump presidency – the agency’s scientific independence was sorely tested. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning There are a few universally agreed-to items on the wish list for an Australian version of the CDC, and independence from government is high on that list. Gilbert says an Australian disease agency should operate as an independent statutory body free from political interference, but also be transparent in its recommendations, “so that at least the public can see where the politicians are making decisions that differ from what the experts are saying and what the data recommend.” It also needs to be supported by secure, long-term core funding that’s not subject to the prevailing political winds, Gilbert says. “It should be accountable and open to review but not on a regular basis where it’s all a bit insecure.” Such an agency should also build on the existing strengths of Australia’s federated public health structure, Sorrell says, rather than scrap it all for a totally centralised model like the US CDC. “New South Wales demonstrated very clearly early on in this pandemic that an established set of networked public health units made it much more readily operational than the centralised systems which were in place at the time in Victoria,” she says. “Covid has demonstrated this really well, that actually where the action is where you need the people, you need the rapid diagnostics and genomics, you need the rapid epidemiology, you need the rapid response.” In fact, centralisation proved a challenge for the US CDC, particularly early in the pandemic when the organisation restricted Covid testing to only a few accredited laboratories. That, combined with an early problem of faulty test kits, created a bottleneck that resulted in a critical delay in the US response.

Formalising that laboratory network could set collection and reporting standards across the network, and provide a national platform for data sharing, Slevin says. “A CDC can set those national best practice systems … it can do so in cooperation with the states so that such mechanisms are well planned, well accepted, well embedded and adopted and create benefits for everybody in Australia, regardless of what jurisdiction you live in.” The other key component of a national disease surveillance and control agency would be the epidemiological analysis of laboratory data, the research that informs the public health response at national, state and local level during an outbreak but is also constantly on the lookout for the next disease threat. Australia does have an agency called the Communicable Diseases Network Australia, which sits under the auspices of the federal health department. Its remit is to coordinate and lead public health and “support best practice for the prevention and control of communicable diseases”. It also collects data on what are called national notifiable diseases – diseases considered of enough concern that they need to be monitored – which include everything from anthrax to tuberculosis. Gilbert, who was involved in establishing the Communicable Diseases Network Australia, says it had done a pretty good job of investigating disease outbreaks in the past, but its ability to respond to the fast-moving pandemic has been hampered by reporting delays and different privacy regulations at the state and territory level. It’s also not in a position to rapidly analyse and report on outbreaks, Gilbert says. “They learn from it and they write reports but there’s a lot of good information lost with every outbreak investigation.” The other issue with these existing organisations is that those involved with them do so on their own time, outside existing full-time jobs, Gilbert says. “There’s not nearly enough support specifically, in the way of either administrative secretarial support or technical support, for either committee to do the extra things that they could do and the information that they gather could get added value from.” This should be the role of the centralised component of a national CDC, says Sorrell: “A centralised authority which is there to really quickly and seamlessly receive laboratory and epidemiological information from the states, and integrate and analyse it at a national level in order to make national decisions.” Such a central authority should also have access to funds for research, which it can distribute quickly as disease issues arise. “One of the things that we’ve seen during the pandemic is that money has been stood up for competitive funding but it’s taken many months for grant applications to be reviewed and funds distributed,” she says. There are state-based infectious disease research organisations, such as the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Victoria and the Kirby Institute in NSW, whose epidemiological and modelling efforts have guided state, territory and federal government during the pandemic. But even Prof Peter Doherty himself says the institution that bears his name serves Victorian public health, and that superficially at least there is a need for a national CDC-like organisation. But he argues that rather than a centralised organisation, Australia needs networked and funded centres of excellence across the states. “The clever way to handle this sort of a situation, from the point of view from Canberra, is to put funding out in a way that while it maybe has its basis in one institution or other – like the ARC research centre of excellence grants – it’s a disseminated thing that draws on excellence in multiple centres across the country,” he says. Whatever the structure of an Australian CDC, Slevin says the lessons of the pandemic point to a need for a massive investment in Australian health infrastructure to strengthen its ability to predict, detect and respond to future epidemics and pandemics. “This really is an essential watershed moment for the Australian health infrastructure, and for us to now, unequivocally commit to building the best possible machinery to allow us to go into the coming decades with a greater degree of confidence that we are ready and prepared for whatever might be coming.”",News/World news,‘This really is an essential watershed moment’: is now the time for an Australian CDC?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/19/this-really-is-an-essential-watershed-moment-is-now-the-time-for-an-australian-cdc
2/19/2022,"Electric vehicles are finally becoming a common sight on Australia’s urban streets, with sales tripling last year. Until recently, though, limited battery size and a lack of fast charging stations meant out-of-town excursions required careful planning.  State governments and fuel suppliers including Ampol have lately announced plans to greatly expand the network of charging sites across inland Australia. Most, though, will take time to build – possibly not fast enough to meet the surge in EVs on the road. Over the recent Christmas period, I sought to test the EV facilities between our two biggest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, during peak driving season. To do so, I borrowed the Ioniq 5, which Hyundai says boasts a range approaching 450km on a full charge, one of the longest in the market. Over a week, we toured the high country of the Snowy Mountains, drove around Melbourne and out to Geelong, before taking the coastal route home, revealing a few pleasures and pitfalls along they way. We already own a small EV, which we charge overnight in the garage off the mains. Borrowing a bigger car with an unfamiliar plug and tapping public charging sites were novelties. As it turned out, a few others we met along almost 3,000km were novices too. At 200km from Sydney, Goulburn – a town known for its giant merino ram statue – was an obvious place to top up the Ioniq’s 72.6 kilowatt-hour battery. Ironically, the charging site we aimed for is located at a petrol station. This would not be the last time we plugged in as people gassed up, and there will be more of this in years to come. Ampol, for instance, plans a $100m national network of “future energy” projects. A veteran Tesla driver cheerfully helped us overcome the first challenge, downloading a necessary app, in this case for the Chargefox chargers. We found camaraderie among EV drivers to be a regular feature at charging points. People were happy to share tales, and had the time to do it, with charge-ups taking anywhere from 15 minutes to more than an hour, depending on the site capacity and range being sought. Less fortunate, though, was a young couple from Canberra, venturing out with their two young children in their new MG, en route to the coastal town of Kiama. “EV equals possible divorce,” the sheepish driver said, as he and his partner failed to download the app. With kids overheating the back seat, his frustrated partner declared defeat. “Let’s go back and get the fossil car.” Decent road trips, of course, require the odd detour off the highway. Skirting Canberra we powered on to Cooma, where we plugged into Snowy Hydro’s charger, presumably renewably sourced. The final 10% of charging is typically a lot slower. Impatient, as the car’s computer was telling us 90%, we figured we’d have ample charge to reach Albury from there. We had a range of 342km and the border town where we planned to stay the night was only 319km away. Some EVs account not only for distance but calculate conditions, such as changing elevation, to improve their predictions. Such capability would have been handy as we wound into the mountains, with no obvious charge points along the way. With instant torque and low centre of gravity – thanks for those batteries – EVs offer a touring experience few petrol vehicles can match. Plus there is no engine noise. Enjoyable though it may have been, we were still plugging up hills. To be safe, we drove with windows down and the AC off – except when summer thunderstorms rumbled over. We also cut speed to reduce the drag. Careful driving meant we outperformed the Ioniq’s estimate, and arrived in Albury with 79km to spare. Among Albury’s allures was free charging, at least for those willing to wait in line at the top of a shopping centre carpark. Apps such as PlugShare, ABRP and Evie help inform drivers of charging availability, and even allow for comments warning about damaged equipment. We meet a couple in a Nissan Leaf, with a 200km range. They were slowly hopping their way to Sydney. During previous tours they had discovered to their concern that their car seemed to overheat if they charged and then tried to drive immediately, so they were getting to know well the cafes along the route. Not every one of our charges went so smoothly. A lack of mobile reception at one site meant we could not use our app, and had to ring the operator to remotely release us from a plug that otherwise refused to let us go. At an overnight stop in Mansfield, there was no charger. However, the motel we stayed at knew the drill, stringing out a 25m extension cord to give us additional juice. “A few people ask for it,” a staffer said. Our final charge was at another big roadstop at Euroa. After that, we took the spectacular Maroondah Highway through the giant mountain ash forests, a road worth taking whatever your means of mobility. Melbourne, as you might imagine, has lots of charging options. But even then nothing is foolproof. A visit to the RACV headquarters in the CBD turned out to be a dud: Covid restricted charging to members only. (Memo: keep checking the apps.) Staying in the Bayside region in the city’s south-east, we made use of the local council’s charging bays on three occasions. Most Melbourne-Sydney road journeys follow the Hume’s north-south trunk but the more scenic – and challenging for EVs – path is the coastal one. Until there are more chargers, few EV drivers will take take the risk. But without the demand, not many private operators will set up shop without government support. The 1,000-plus kilometre route is popular for drivers with more time on their hands, in part because of the region’s beauty but also the less crowded beaches and forests. Heading eastwards into Gippsland was straightforward, until you hit Sale. This was a crucial destination, not just for our journey. During our wait to charge, a busy line-up of vehicles gathered nearby. Luckily, the Port of Sale location comes with a cafe and gallery to fill any down time, and there are river cruise options too, if the wait is a really long one. For those continuing on to NSW, a “long hop” awaits, as one driver, Tom, describes it. He normally wouldn’t charge his Tesla beyond 96% because it reduces battery performance over time. But, for this trip, Tom makes an exception and advises us to do so too. We take the 23 minutes extra to go from 90% to 100%. As we had been driving conservatively, our Ioniq reckons we have a 480km range departing Sale. Our destination, Bega, is 395km away – so we exit with confidence. However, this estimate doesn’t take into account windy roads, even if there are few steep climbs. We watch with growing intent as the battery buffer steadily shrinks. With about 130km to go, and the sun setting as we near the NSW border, the car starts to guess we might have a problem reaching our nearest charge point. We ease back on the pedal, trimming speed to 90km/h in 100km/h zones. Our ETA blows out by half an hour. With 40km to go, and about 10% charge, the car’s screens start to warn us to search for alternative recharging. This is what “range anxiety” looks like. We slow down further going up hills, and roll down the other side in a bid to recapture any extra charge we can from the regenerative brakes. We’re conscious that Bega sits on a plateau, so the last section will involve climbing. Thankfully it’s evening and we don’t need air-conditioning, but we start to wonder whether saving on lights might make a difference. Half in jest, we ponder how many more metres our phone batteries might offer. Cars bank up behind as they await the chance to overtake us. We’d heard carmakers build in some reserve at zero, much as combustion engines can run on “empty” for a while. With 1.6km to go to the charge point, and only 5km range remaining, if something goes wrong, we’ll have to find out if the Hyundai has hidden watts. Fortunately, we locate the charger without fuss, and find Tesla Tom from Sale topping up. Some rowdy locals declare us a “captive audience” so we bolt with a 14% charge, vowing to return in daylight. Charging points are often in poorly lit parts of town, we found. At 7am, Bega’s streets are clear, as is the charging bay. At 80% capacity, the battery generously tells us we have a range of 354km, not far shy of the 460km we’d need to make it all the way back to Sydney, with detours. From now on, though, there are many more refill options. We make the most of free electricity by NRMA, recharging at the three “Bs” – Bega, Batemans Bay and Berry. The whole return leg doesn’t cost us a thing. Just about 9.30pm, we park outside our Sydney home. The odometer’s clocked our journey at 2,861km. Since our drive, NSW has released plans to build 1,000 charging stations over the next four years. An indicative map suggests at least the south-east town of Eden will get a charger, shortening the “long hop”. Victoria, too, is stepping up its $100m Zero Emissions Vehicle Roadmap aimed at building on the 116 sites already supported by the state’s government. Those sites, and many others, could come in a rush, particularly if hotels and other resorts see EV charging a magnet. They might need to if they are meet the huge increase in such vehicles in coming years and the expectations of their cashed-up owners.",News/Environment,"Leading the charge: road-testing Australia’s EV stations on a 2,800km round trip",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/19/leading-the-charge-road-testing-australias-ev-stations-on-a-2800km-round-trip
2/19/2022,"Researchers at DNA Zoo Australia have mapped the genome of the numbat for the first time. The milestone is notable in its own right, motivated by a desire to improve conservation efforts for the endangered termite-eating marsupial, which is now found only in small pockets of Western Australia. But in announcing the development last week, scientists also had a more extraordinary suggestion: that the numbat’s DNA could be used as a blueprint to bring its extinct cousin, the thylacine, back from the dead.  The last known Tasmanian tiger died in 1936, but the apex predator – which once also roamed the Australian mainland and Kangaroo Island – continues to beguile and obsess even in extinction. It seems hard to imagine that the carnivorous marsupials might once again roam the Apple Isle in future, but recent advances in gene-editing technology have scientists convinced that de-extinction is no longer confined to the realm of science fiction. Can we really revive a species from extinction, and if so, should we? One de-extinction avenue scientists are exploring is to take the genome of a living species and edit its DNA to more closely resemble that of an extinct relative. The first step in this process requires an intact genetic blueprint of the extinct animal, says Prof Andrew Pask at the University of Melbourne. In 2017, Pask’s team sequenced the thylacine genome from a juvenile specimen held in Museums Victoria’s collection. “It’s one of the best genome builds we have for an extinct animal,” he says. “It’s in lots of little tiny pieces when we get it from an extinct specimen, so the DNA is broken up. “The problem with any mammal genome, not just the thylacine … is that half of our genome is made up of repeat sequences,” Pask says – repeating patterns of A, C, G and T nucleotide bases. “Those bits are really hard to put back together when you’re building your puzzle, particularly because we don’t have the picture on the box of the puzzle – we don’t know what [the thylacine genome] is meant to look like.” This is where the numbat genome could be helpful. Numbats and thylacines had a common ancestor that lived about 35m to 41m years ago – “not a long time in the evolutionary timescale”, says Parwinder Kaur, the director of DNA Zoo Australia and an associate professor at the University of Western Australia. Kaur estimates numbats and thylacines share 95% of their DNA, and that the living marsupial’s genome could be used as a reference to fill in the gaps for the thylacine, for which “we don’t have a complete blueprint”. Both species belong to the Dasyuromorphia order of animals, which also includes most of Australia’s carnivorous marsupials, such as Tasmanian devils, quolls and dunnarts. The genetic makeup of these animals “has been highly conserved in terms of keeping its DNA in the same order,” Kaur says. The comprehensive thylacine genome can then be compared to a relative’s genome to determine which sequences differ, Pask says. Using Crispr-Cas9, the Nobel prize-winning genome editing method, it is possible to “turn all of those bits that are different to look like thylacine DNA”. Though the numbat is genetically similar to the thylacine, it is not an ideal candidate for gene editing, Pask says. “We wouldn’t use the numbat because of its specialisation as an anteater. We would probably use another, like a Tasmanian devil or a dunnart … [which] eat meat, so they’re going to have a much more thylacine-like digestive system.” Currently, gene editing isn’t advanced enough to be able to change all of the differing sequences to thylacine DNA in a timely manner. “It would take hundreds of years to go through and do it with our current technology,” Pask says. Any de-extinction via this process would therefore involve prioritising which DNA sequences to target, yielding a gene-edited animal genome that isn’t exactly the same as the extinct one. Pask adds: “We then need to be able to turn a marsupial DNA-containing cell into a living marsupial, and we don’t have that technology developed yet either.” Another way to bring a species back from the dead is to clone it, à la Dolly the sheep, using a method called somatic cell nuclear transfer. The process involves taking a nucleus – the structure containing the genome – from the cell of an extinct animal and inserting it into an egg of a living relative species, which has had its own nucleus removed. It relies on intact cells from the extinct species, so is only practical when the last animal has recently died – which effectively rules the method out for thylacines. Scientists have already used the technique successfully, although the triumph was short-lived. In 2003, researchers cloned a Pyrenean ibex, a subspecies of the Iberian wild goat that went extinct when Celia, the last living individual, was killed by a falling tree. The team successfully cloned Celia, reviving the subspecies from extinction for several minutes, before the newborn animal died of a lung defect. The aptly named Lazarus project, led by Prof Mike Archer, a palaeontologist at the University of New South Wales, is taking a similar approach to try to bring back the southern gastric-brooding frog. The last known specimen of the frog, which was native to Queensland, died in 1983, but the team have some well-preserved tissues. Though the project has successfully produced early-stage embryos, no clones so far have survived to tadpoles or adult frogs. How to bring species back from the dead is one question; whether we should is another. Pask believes the thylacine is one of the best candidates for de-extinction efforts because there are sound ecological reasons for bringing it back. Apex predators like the Tasmanian tiger play an important role in stabilising ecosystems, he says. Archer agrees, citing the successful reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone national park in the US. “The primary habitat where the thylacine was is still there, and the animals that they fed on are still there,” he says. Archer – who previously led the Australian Museum’s 1999 effort to revive the thylacine, which was scrapped in 2005 – says de-extinction is “too enticing [and] probably too important” a research topic for the scientific community not to progress on. “There are those people who would argue that this is playing God … I don’t buy that,” he says. “This is about playing smart human to redress the times when we inappropriately played God by exterminating things.” In the US, an effort to bring back the woolly mammoth by editing the genome of the Asian elephant has been widely publicised, and also criticised. “Ecologically, it’s a very hard argument to make to bring that animal back,” Pask says, though he is personally excited by the project. “I don’t think it’s particularly good for the environment or the mammoth.” Because woolly mammoths have been extinct for thousands of years, it is more difficult to piece together an intact genome, Pask says. “It’s likely then that whatever the animal is that they bring back will be more of an amalgamation between the Asian elephant and the mammoth.” The project to genetically revive the mammoth “undermines the ongoing effort to save every sad species on the brink”, Mark Carnall, an Oxford University Museum of Natural History curator, wrote in this masthead in 2017. Pask agrees that money is better spent on conservation efforts for endangered species. “That is a much more noble pursuit than trying to bring back something that’s been dead for [thousands of] years.” But he believes the same approaches that underpin de-extinction efforts are useful in the short-term for marsupial conservation, particularly in the face of existential threats like increasingly severe bushfires. “The recent bushfires that we’ve had started to wipe out … populations of marsupials that have different genetic diversity. “If we were able to go out and collect cells [from fire-affected species], freeze them down, and then bring back members of that species with that genetic diversity, we could really help safeguard marsupials against things like these horrendous weather events. “We want to do that work for conservation benefits right now for marsupials,” he says. “It will one day then provide the basis that we would need if we want to consider bringing the thylacine back.”",News/Australia news,De-extinction puzzle: how decoding numbat DNA could help resurrect the Tasmanian tiger,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/19/de-extinction-puzzle-how-decoding-numbat-dna-could-help-resurrect-the-tasmanian-tiger
2/19/2022,"Back in the Howard era, we used to talk about dog whistles. The point about dog whistles is they are subtle things. The sound is supposed to be inaudible to humans. Scott Morrison holds power in a much noisier era. Everybody shouts, the prime minister loudest of all. There was nothing subtle or inaudible about the penultimate sitting week of the current parliament. It was one of the ugliest political weeks in recent memory.  The short version of this story is Morrison weaponised national security. The prime minister knows a significant chunk of voters don’t yet have a settled view about Anthony Albanese, so, generously, he filled in some blanks. Albanese was weak. He was sneaky. He was China’s candidate for the prime ministership, which of course made him deeply suspect. Morrison was very obviously trying to outrun the leaks and the disaster of the previous week. Trying to stay one step ahead of conservatives furious about his failure to deliver the religious discrimination package. Trying to keep level pegging with Peter Dutton, who is auditioning for the top job. Most of all, trying to capture the attention of disengaged voters who determine the outcome of elections, and consume their politics in broad brush strokes. Trying, like a boss. As Jenny Morrison shared about her husband on last Sunday’s 60 Minutes program, the prime minister is very task orientated. His current task orientation is twofold: don’t die wondering about whether you can pull off the second coming, and don’t worry too much about what it might cost. If you were watching the week, you’ll already know Morrison’s pre-campaign framing of Albanese and Labor was about as subtle as a meat axe. It was also reckless and destructive enough to trigger rare public pushback from Canberra’s national security establishment – both past and present. What you might have missed was Morrison’s pep talk to the party room on Tuesday. That was also pretty extraordinary, but in the cacophonous quest to unmask the Manchurian Candidate, it got much less coverage. A few quick points to explain this convention. Government MPs meet every Tuesday when the parliament sits. These discussions nominally happen behind closed doors, but the meeting is semi-public in the sense that a government MP provides a background briefing to journalists afterwards about the subjects canvassed, usually with a prime ministerial staffer hovering in the background. Now – to what Morrison said. There was an implicit apology from the prime minister. “You haven’t seen me as focused as I can be yet.” Morrison said he intended to get sharper. He gave MPs a predictable lecture about unity. Then he gave an unvarnished explication of the government’s immediate political objectives. Reviving the character test legislation (which makes it easier for the immigration minister to cancel visas) would highlight “the risk of Labor” more than any other piece of legislation, Morrison told his MPs. If Labor could oblige the government by voting against that measure, that would deliver some “sharp contrast”. Morrison urged his colleagues to put “the starkness of the choice in front of the Australian people”. The prime minister said: “I know how to do that, and I know that is how you win elections. I know what the path is and I’ll be following it.” I said a moment ago this contribution was extraordinary. Best explain. Extraordinary at two levels, I reckon. The first was how naked Morrison’s objectives were. A lot of political leaders would feel compelled to dress up their intraday political tactics in more lofty terms, particularly when the tactics are reductionist and brutal. But not Morrison. He relishes the mechanics. They aren’t a means to an end. They are the end. Which brings us to the second point. All of the focus in Tuesday’s presentation seemed to be on the nuts and bolts of winning. How you compete for attention in the attention economy. How you tenderise your opponents before landing the knockout blow. Lots about the how. Seemingly absent in Tuesday’s tutorial was the why. Some MPs wondered whether Morrison would get around to articulating a purpose for winning. Obviously there is an implicit purpose: keeping Labor out of office. When everything is this bareknuckle, and tribal, when cortisol levels are raised to the levels we witnessed this week, mired in the thrum of fight or flight, I guess that would feel like a goal of sorts. But it’s not at all clear what the agenda of a fourth-term Coalition government would look like, or even what this disparate group of people sitting behind the banner of the Liberal and National parties would want it to be. Thus far, the government’s pitch for retaining office is all backward looking.

He won an election three years ago with no policy, and no pitch, apart from Bill Shorten is the bill Australia can’t afford. I suspect a concrete agenda creates liabilities for a prime minister who wants to be able to pivot with maximum speed until he hits the precise formula to drag the Coalition across the line. If you think this last point is an overstatement, or a cynical eyeroll, just think about this past month, where Morrison has lurched between we must get government out of people’s faces, right now, because who needs government – to come to Big Daddy. Only a Coalition government is sufficiently present and muscular to save you from Xi Jinping and his useful idiots in Australia. Whiplash is for wimps. Morrison also won’t care about the institutional backlash that has accompanied his tactical hysteria this week. That’s a transaction cost of changing the conversation from deaths in aged care to national security. If the current play doesn’t work, he’ll pivot again. But out in the real world, voters really are entitled to know whether this government has a plan for them and for the country that extends beyond Morrison’s inveterate brinkmanship. Given Morrison hasn’t really articulated the why, funny then that the media narrative casts Albanese as the small target actor. It’s fair enough of course. The Labor leader is a small target. When the communist hunters rolled into Canberra looking for scalps, Albanese rolled Labor up into a tiny ball. Labor waved the character test legislation through the House of Representatives this week, and when the government regrouped around a second security wedge, a proposal to increase maximum sentences for firearms trafficking and mandatory minimum sentences of five years in prison offences, Labor promptly suspended standing orders to debate the bill, which then passed the lower house without opposition. The government had hoped for a succession of speeches from Labor MPs objecting to mandatory sentencing, given the current party platform is unequivocal. It states: “Labor opposes mandatory sentencing.” When it was obvious that wasn’t going to happen, Dutton crunched the proposal through to the third reading so it would clear the lower house without the political inconvenience of Labor being seen to support it. So small target, absolutely. But Labor does have policy out there that begins to map a story about the future. Albanese told the House this week the pandemic had shaped Labor’s policy thinking. A public health emergency was “an opportunity to take a step back and think about how you should emerge from the crisis even stronger”. “We in the opposition have been doing just that,” he said. His objective was creating “a better future for Australia as we emerge from this crisis – a stronger economy that lifts up living standards, delivers for working people and is more resilient going forward”. Albanese listed policy commitments Labor has already rolled out in energy and emissions reduction, enhancing sovereign capability in manufacturing, 475,000 free vocational education places in areas of skills shortages and 20,000 additional university places, additional health spending, an expansion of the national broadband network, and cheaper childcare. The Labor leader has the bedrock in place for a campaign. Albanese’s core strategy of surviving until the time comes to live has kept Labor in the contest. What remains to be seen, though, is whether Albanese can find an extra gear. He’ll need it, because Morrison isn’t bringing a knife to a gunfight.",News/Australia news,"After one of the ugliest political weeks in recent memory, it’s still not clear what Scott Morrison’s agenda is | Katharine Murphy",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/19/after-one-of-the-ugliest-political-weeks-in-recent-memory-its-still-not-clear-what-scott-morrisons-agenda-is
2/19/2022,"Ralph ‘Terry’ Gibbs believed he was “acting out of love” when he made an ill-fated dash across the Australian outback to bring his partner with dementia home, but the 80-year-old ended up with a suspended jail sentence and a two-year restraining order. Gibbs took his partner of 15 years, Carol Lisle, on 4 January from a nursing home in Mandurah – an hour south of Perth. The builder said he wanted to take her back to their Queensland home near the beach.  Police found the pair in unforgiving 43C heat, deep in the harsh and remote Western Australian desert – just an hour from the Northern Territory border. After two days on the lam, the 84-year-old, wheelchair-bound Lisle was reportedly found distressed, smelling of urine, and still in the same trousers and floral top she was wearing when taken. Gibbs, who the court heard had not slept properly for days, was interrogated, arrested and placed in jail. He was charged with deprivation of liberty and endangering Lisle’s life, but on 9 February he pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of unlawful detention. This week, wearing thongs and supported by a bare wooden crutch, Gibbs hobbled into Perth magistrates court and was sentenced to seven months’ jail, suspended for 12 months. Magistrate Raelene Johnston told Gibbs that although he was motivated by love, he had put his wishes above Lisle’s needs. “I accept that you believe you were acting out of love and that you were acting out of care for your partner and that you wanted to be with her, and you believed that she wanted to be with you,” Johnston said. “But objectively your conduct was extremely dangerous, and the objective seriousness of your offending was made clear by the reactions of those people who observed you.” The court heard that witnesses at a shopping centre in Kalgoorlie, about seven hours’ drive east of Mandurah, saw Gibbs leave Lisle in the car and suggested he take his passenger to hospital. Gibbs maintained she was happy and fine on the journey. He said he had plenty of food, water, medication and 11 jerry cans of diesel to fuel his recently purchased Mazda ute. He said the pair had traversed gravel tracks and slept in the car on the edge of the road during their trip. But Johnston, in her sentencing remarks, said the escapade could have ended in tragedy. For Gibbs it did. The sad reality is that a two-year restraining order now imposed on Gibbs, who has medical issues and reduced mobility, means he may never see his lover again. “I fear that I might never see my little girl again, she is fading quickly,” he told the media outside court. The case highlights the brutal toll dementia can take on families. Dementia is the leading cause of death for women in Australia and there are an estimated 487,5000 Australians living with the disease in 2022, according to Dementia Australia. Lisle has Parkinson’s disease and has suffered dementia symptoms for the past three years, Gibbs said outside court. She was placed in the Mercy Place Mandurah aged cared facility in March last year by the State Administrative Tribunal under a guardianship ruling. “Seeing her in the care home in Perth was devastating,” Gibbs said.

Gibbs said that since Lisle was taken from Queensland while he was in hospital, Covid restrictions have meant he had only been allowed into WA to visit her on four occasions. “The whole thing was very frustrating.” He said he treasured what little time the pair could spend together. “I sat there for the whole day, just holding her hand, that’s all I did. “All day every day she says, ‘please take me out of here, please take me out of here’, and when I would leave to go home she would say, ‘can I come with you?’ “She even wanted to walk to the airport.” A New Zealand native, Gibbs is the father of five children, two who still live in his birth country. His daughter Rochelle Gibbs has started a Go Fund Me page to raise money for her dad’s legal costs. In court, Johnston said Gibbs’ behaviour was in the “very high category of seriousness” for this type of offence, despite his love for Lisle. The magistrate labelled the crime premeditated but said there have been no long-terms effects on Lisle. She said sentencing was not an easy exercise in this case because Gibbs had acted out of love. At the time, Lisle’s disappearance sparked an extensive man hunt through remote WA before the pair were found near Warakurna, a large Aboriginal community on Ngaanyatjarra country. Lisle was taken to a nursing post in Warakurna before being airlifted by the Royal Flying Doctor Service. “As she was about to be taken to the plane she was asleep and I yelled out to her and everyone heard me say, ‘love you sweetheart’ and her eyes opened and she said, ‘love you too’,” Gibbs said. “That’s the way we were all these years.”",News/Australia news,"Man, 80, avoids jail after taking partner out of Western Australia nursing home in outback dash",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/19/man-80-avoids-jail-after-taking-partner-out-of-western-australia-nursing-home-in-outback-dash
2/19/2022,"The United Australia party has been criticised for picturing one of its candidates in military uniform in political advertisements, an act defence advocates say is “wrong” and could be interpreted as suggesting defence support for the party. Clive Palmer’s UAP is again running a vast number of candidates across every lower house seat. This week, the UAP used full-page ads in major Australian newspapers to publish the names, mobile phone numbers and pictures of each candidate.  One of the candidates, Benjamin Britton, who is running in the New South Wales electorate of Cunningham, was pictured wearing a beret. Defence has in previous elections warned political candidates against using their military uniform to campaign for political office, saying it threatens the independence of the Australian Defence Force. In 2019, it sent official notices to former military members standing for election, warning them against appearing in uniform during campaigning. The Australia Defence Association, an independent watchdog monitoring defence matters, criticised the UAP for picturing Britton in the beret, saying it was “wrong” and should cease. ADA executive director, Neil James, said the beret appears to be an older version of the beret worn by 3rd battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, indicating Britton is a veteran. James said representing military service in such a fashion, where it was the only available image of the candidate, suggested to voters that the ADF supports the person’s candidacy. He said the practice, if allowed to continue, risked politicising the military. “You’ve got to condemn this. No one will support this. No one in defence,” he said. “It’s wrong, I don’t care about how proud he is about his service, it’s wrong to misrepresent the ADF as endorsing his candidacy.” Britton, who did not respond to a request for comment, is not the first to use military uniform in this way. In 2016, the veteran turned Liberal MP for Canning, Andrew Hastie, was ousted from the army reserve for using campaign banners portraying him in uniform. At the time he defended their use, saying: “It’s just a hint at, ‘Hey, for the past 13 years, I’ve been serving in uniform’ and my formative experiences as a leader were with the Australian Defence Force’.” The ADA made the same criticism in 2020 when Scott Morrison used images of the military in advertisements about the government’s bushfire response. “It’s simple. You don’t use the defence force for party political advantage,” James said at the time. A number of other candidates either work with Palmer or are related to him. Martin Brewster, Palmer’s nephew and Queensland Nickel procurement director, is running for the Senate. James McDonald, also running for the Senate, was Palmer’s chief of staff and has worked for Palmer in other businesses. Domenic Martino, the party’s lead Senate candidate in NSW, also serves as an executive for several mining and gas companies, including coalminer Cokal.",News/Australia news,"Clive Palmer’s UAP ‘wrong’ to picture candidate in military uniform, defence watchdog says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/19/clive-palmers-uap-wrong-to-picture-candidate-in-military-uniform-defence-watchdog-says
2/19/2022,"The effectiveness of the Covid vaccine remains high in the first two months after receiving a booster, and then begins to wane, a report published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has found, providing insight into how immunity against the virus fares after a third shot. The CDC report says that during the Omicron-predominant period, vaccine effectiveness against emergency department visits and hospitalisation was 87% and 91%, respectively, in the two months after a third dose.  By the fourth month after a booster dose, this decreased to 66% and 78% respectively, which is still strong protection. By comparison, Australian data suggests influenza vaccination is associated with a 31% reduction in influenza-related deaths, though this changes depending on influenza strain and vaccine. It is still early days into Omicron, and we will need several months more data to determine if and how often further shots may be needed. Fourth doses are already recommended in Australia for the immunocompromised, who produce a lower immune response than the equivalent number of doses in healthy people. Most countries, including the US, Chile, and the UK, are taking a similar approach to Australia, focussing fourth doses on the immunocompromised. Israel, which began administering third doses in July, is the first country to administer a fourth dose more widely. There, anyone who is a health worker, immunocompromised, or over 60 has been eligible for a fourth dose since January, and the government is considering expanding eligibility to all adults even in the absence of strong data to support this. Preliminary data from Israel suggests among adults aged 60 and older, the fourth dose raises protection against severe illness by up to three times compared with those vaccinated with a third dose. But Dr Michelle Willicombe, from Imperial College London’s department of immunology, told the British Medical Journal that even if a fourth dose proves to further boost antibodies in healthy people, it does not mean it will be necessary, as other aspects of the immune system, aside from those induced by vaccination, also offer protection. “If you give someone a boost, and they’ve got a normal immune system, they’re going to get a boost in response,” she said. “The question is, is it needed? I don’t know the answer to that … the clinical efficacy data, not just infection rates but hospital admissions, deaths, etc, would guide that.” There is also a lack of safety data for a fourth dose and, while it is likely to be safe given what we know about third doses, Australian regulators require strong data before approving additional doses. It is important to recognise that it is very rare for any vaccine to provide sterilising immunity; that is, enabling the immune system to completely prevent a virus from replicating in and infecting the body. Measles, pertussis (whooping cough), polio and likely Covid-19 vaccines are all examples of vaccines that do not provide sterilising immunity. Yet measles and polio have still been eliminated in many countries, and their disease burden worldwide has been significantly reduced. This is because, just like the Covid-19 vaccines, the vaccines for these illnesses are extremely good at preventing severe disease and death. However, three doses of the Covid-19 vaccines are needed to get this strong protection against severe disease and death, particularly from the Omicron strain. “Vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease with the Omicron variant is substantially lower than against the Delta variant, with rapid waning,” data from the UK Health Security Agency says. “However, protection against hospitalisation remains high, particularly after three doses.” If it does turn out that more than three doses of Covid-19 vaccines are eventually recommended, it will not be unusual. The whooping cough vaccine, for example, is a five-dose course. The flu vaccination is recommended every year, although it is tweaked to target influenza strains predicted to circulate that season. Ass Prof Sanjaya Senanayake, an infectious diseases specialist at the Australian National University, said if a fourth dose is required more broadly, the preference would be for a variant-specific one. “Right now, both Pfizer and Moderna have updated their formulations to develop an Omicron-specific vaccine,” he said. “If the vaccines do well in trials, they will become available to the general public, but this may not be until the second half of the year. Hopefully the combination of natural immunity from these Omicron waves and lingering booster immunity, in combination with commonsense Covid-safe measures, will protect us till then.”Until then, it is sensible to continue to target a fourth dose at vulnerable populations, such as the immunocompromised, he said. Just over 51% of Australians over the age of 18 have received their third dose. While such a high proportion of the world has woeful access to vaccination, there is a higher risk of new variants emerging, including those that can evade available vaccines. Though vaccination is vital, countries like Australia would be better protected against new Covid variants in the long term if they also donated more vaccine doses to less wealthy countries, research shows.",News/Australia news,What happens when the Covid booster wanes? Will you need a fourth vaccine dose? Or a fifth? ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/19/what-happens-when-the-covid-booster-wanes-will-you-need-a-fourth-vaccine-dose-or-a-fifth
2/19/2022,"When Jacqui Coleman heard that Australia’s largest coal-fired power station was to close seven years earlier than planned, she initially didn’t believe it. Coleman is a retail worker in Dora Creek, the closest suburb to the Eraring power station on the shores of Lake Macquarie in New South Wales.  For years, she has been selling pies, coffees and sandwiches to some of the hundreds of workers who pass through the News ’n’ More grocery store on either side of a shift. On Thursday morning, Origin Energy announced it was bringing forward the station’s closure to 2025. Many workers at the site first learned their jobs were to be terminated seven years early when they heard it reported on the radio. As Coleman heard one customer after another talking about the news, she said “it hit home that it’s really happening”. “I feel for all of the people whose jobs are going to be lost, especially when some of them have been there for so long. What are they going to do?” she said. “I don’t think the boss is worried for the business because we’ve got enough of the community coming through. “But it’s the workers I worry about. They’ve got families as well. Who is going to support them?” Origin Energy said its decision reflected a rapidly changing energy market in which traditional power stations could not compete with cheaper, renewable options. The Nature Conservation Council of NSW estimated the exit of Eraring would avoid up to 87m tonnes of climate pollution, describing it as a “ray of hope for leaving a safe climate for our children”. But the council said the NSW and federal governments also had a task ahead of them to ensure a seamless transition for both the energy grid and communities affected by station closures. In the NSW Hunter region, four power stations are set to close – on current schedules – by 2033. AGL’s Liddell power station is first in 2023, followed by Eraring in 2025, Vales Point in 2029 and Bayswater no later than 2033. Governments have had years to prepare communities and workers for the transition to a green economy. And yet calls for action from the Lake Macquarie region have gone unanswered. Kay Fraser is the mayor of Lake Macquarie city council, which serves a population of 209,000 in centres including Belmont, Charlestown, Swansea, Toronto, Morriset and Warners Bay. She said the community was “devastated” by Thursday’s announcement, which would affect not only the 400 workers at the plant but thousands more in the supply chain, and the areas they live. “We’ve known this was coming but it’s like a train wreck,” she said. “What I want to see happen is a jobs package and transition package but I don’t want them to talk about it for two years. It needs to happen now.” The NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, has promised to announce a jobs package to support affected communities. Cory Wright, the NSW and ACT secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers’ Union, said that plan should have been ready when Origin made its announcement. “You can imagine that some of these workers had a 10-year plan in mind in which they were preparing to make a transition. That’s been cut down now,” he said. Wright said the union would be looking for a plan from Kean that supported not only the 400 directly affected workers but everyone downstream. “This has been bandied about for years, that’s how long we’ve been talking about a transition, and we’ve been begging employers and governments to put their money where their mouth is,” he said. The union’s NSW branch is one of the founders of the Hunter Jobs Alliance, a coalition of groups that historically have sometimes been at odds with each other. They include unions such as the Electrical Trades Union and the United Workers Union, alongside environment groups that have been pushing for a phase-out of coal power, among them the Lock the Gate Alliance, the Hunter Community Environment Centre and the Nature Conservation Council of NSW. For years, the jobs alliance has been pushing the NSW and federal government to establish a statutory authority to guide the massive shift in the region’s economy. Warrick Jordan, the alliance’s coordinator, said the first priority had to be workers and their families, some of whom had now had “their lives turned upside down”. “People have been advocating for years for a government authority and for specific programs to help workers and attract jobs,” he said. “If the closure of Australia’s biggest power station, with the loss of 400 jobs, isn’t a trigger for a Hunter Valley transition authority and workers support and investment attraction, then I don’t know what is.” Georgina Woods, usually known for her work with Lock the Gate, represents the Nature Conservation Council on the jobs alliance. Woods, who lives in Newcastle, said the Origin announcement was “a travesty” that could have been avoided were it not for Australia’s toxic climate politics. Instead, there was no architecture in place to support workers. “We can’t afford to let long term structural and environmental issues of this kind be held to ransom by the political process and elections,” she said. She pointed to the closure of BHP’s steelworks in Newcastle in the 90s, which took years of planning and attention to pathways for workers. “There was money from the federal government, there was investment in building stuff in Newcastle to provide new opportunities. It was a massive undertaking,” she said. “This [closure] is three years away. Origin needs to create a fund now that will be used to help the workforce transition and help the community of western Lake Macquarie.” Greg Piper is the independent state MP for Lake Macquarie. His son works at the Eraring site as a contractor. He said Origin’s decision was a welcome one for the climate and acknowledged there were people who would happily see the station close even sooner. “I have always supported a move away from coal but the fact is, the workers and this power station have been the heavy lifters in giving energy security to NSW,” he said. Piper said there would be workers who had qualifications that were not readily transferable and who would require retraining. He said it was important such opportunities allowed people to keep living in the region. “We can’t be patronising and say we’re going to offer you the opportunity to retrain and can you please move 100km away,” he said. “We’ve got to find opportunities for investment to keep people here.”",News/Australia news,‘A train wreck’: what happens to workers and towns when the lights go out on coal power?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/19/a-train-wreck-what-happens-to-workers-and-towns-when-the-lights-go-out-on-coal-power
2/19/2022,"A former French soldier has been sentenced to life in prison for the murder of an eight-year-old girl he abducted from a wedding reception near Chambery in the French Alps, which had triggered a six-month police search for the missing child that gripped France. Nordahl Lelandais, 39, who briefly worked as a military dog trainer in the French army, was convicted of the kidnapping and murder of the child, Maëlys De Araujo, who he had persuaded away from the wedding party and into his car in August 2017 while her parents and relatives were celebrating.  Lelandais was described by the prosecution as a “psychopath” who presented “a complete danger to society”. He was also convicted of separate charges of the sexual abuse of two other children. Lelandais is already serving a prison sentence for the brutal beating to death of a serviceman who disappeared while hitchhiking in the same area months before the eight-year-old was abducted. In a statement to the court just before it retired to consider a verdict, Lelandais admitted all charges against him and offered an apology. “I know the families will never accept my excuses, but I present them with the greatest sincerity,” he said, adding that he understood the “lengthy” period of introspection ahead of him which he said he has already started. The lawyer for Maëlys De Araujo’s mother said he doubted Lelandais’ capacity “to have any introspection on the crimes he has committed”. Police had searched for months after the eight-year-old disappeared from the wedding reception where Lelandais was a guest. He denied any involvement until investigators found traces of the girl’s blood in his car. He finally led them to her remains in February 2018. But he has refused to give a coherent account of what took place or exactly how she died. During the trial, the groom at the wedding broke down as he described how he hadn’t seen Lelandais for several years and had only invited him to part of the wedding at the last minute on a whim when he had telephoned. The groom described the panic at the reception when the child, the daughter of his cousin, couldn’t be found. He said a happy day had turned into a neverending nightmare. Lelandais had been at an earlier part of the wedding and had asked to come back for the late-night wedding reception. Lelandais was convicted in May 2021 for the killing of Cpl Arthur Noyer in the early hours of 12 April 2017. He had picked up Noyer, 23, as he hitchhiked after leaving a nightclub in Chambery.",News/World news,Maëlys De Araujo: former French soldier sentenced life in prison for girl’s murder ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/18/maelys-de-araujo-former-french-soldier-sentenced-life-in-prison-for-girls
2/19/2022,"Dizzee Rascal’s ex-fiancee has said she left the rapper because of “domestic abuse”, a court has heard. The rapper, whose real name is Dylan Kwabena Mills, denies assaulting Cassandra Jones at a residential property in Streatham, south London, on 8 June last year, as they argued about their children after their break-up.  Mills, who attended the trial at Wimbledon magistrates court on Friday, had two children with Jones before they split up in February 2021. Helena Duong, the prosecutor, said the alleged assault occurred in “the context of a domestic dispute” about child contact during a “fairly chaotic scene” when he dropped off their daughter at the property. The court heard that during the incident, Mills allegedly barged his way into the house carrying their son, started “shouting and screaming”, “put his forehead against hers and pushed her around the room” and “pushed her to the ground”. The prosecution said that during the incident, Mills “became very angry and started acting erratically, banging his head three times on the fridge with his son in his arms”. But the defence, Sallie Bennett-Jenkins QC, questioned “inconsistencies” in several witness statements Jones had made about the incident. She argued that both Mills and Jones were screaming at each other during the argument. Jones, who became increasingly upset during her cross-examination, replied: “Yes, because I was screaming to give back my son. “He said: ‘I cannot understand why you left me,’ and I said: ‘I left you because of domestic abuse,’” she added. When the defence questioned her on why she wrote that he “threw” her to the ground in one statement rather than “barged” her, Jones said: “I was in shock about what had happened and I was still caring for both our babies. “I’m sorry I used the wrong word but what happened happened and all I can do is speak my truth.” When the defence questioned her claims that Mills “nearly dropped” their son, Jones said: “He is listening and he knows he did that. He knows. He knows. He knows he nearly did that.” Jones had earlier told the court that Mills “was out of control” during the incident. She said that when Mills “nearly dropped” their son, the baby “was screaming for me and I said: ‘Please just give me him.’” “I was scared for my babies,” she added. Mills, of Sevenoaks in Kent, who was charged on 2 August last year, denies assault by beating. He released his debut album, Boy in da Corner, aged 18 in 2003 and scored a string of No 1s, including Bonkers, and Dance wiv Me, on 2009’s Tongue n’ Cheek.

2/19/2022,"British intelligence, so used to operating in the shadows, has been thrust into the spotlight during the Ukraine crisis, cited by Boris Johnson on Wednesday to warn that Russian troop numbers were still increasing or by the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, last month to warn of a possible coup in Kyiv. As the crisis has intensified, the warnings have, if anything, become even less subtle. An extraordinary video released on Thursday by the Ministry of Defence, billed in capital letters as an “intelligence update”, included a Dad’s Army-style map showing a possible Russian invasion plan and other assessments aimed at the general public.  INTELLIGENCE UPDATE: We have seen no evidence that Russian forces are withdrawing from Ukrainian border regions. Russia retains a significant military presence that can conduct an invasion without further warning. pic.twitter.com/qTYrItLxCf A female narrator carefully intones “our intelligence tells us” that Russia has been rapidly been building up forces near Ukraine’s border – as has been documented by independent analysts – and that “an invasion could happen within days”. On Twitter the two-minute clip has been viewed more than 66,000 times. Behind the scenes the effort has been matched by a string of off-the-record briefings from which information has emerged, supported by quotes sourced to officials. It marks an unusually determined and focused effort to seize control of the Ukraine story from the Kremlin, traditionally considered expert in what is sometimes described as information warfare. “It’s a very different approach from the past, when intelligence and information was more closely guarded,” said Prof Malcolm Chalmers of the Rusi thinktank. “What Britain and the west have learned from the last Ukraine crisis in 2014 is that if you don’t actively use your intelligence to shape the narrative, then you will lose ground to Russia.” Russia’s seizure of the Crimea in 2014 appeared to come as something of a surprise to an apparently sleepy Nato. And the image of the military alliance was further damaged last summer during the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, where the idea of a Taliban takeover was barely mentioned or discussed until the fall of Kabul. This time the thinking is that highlighting Vladimir Putin’s possible intentions leaves less room for Kremlin deniability. The west has for some time considered that Moscow is seeking to manufacture a provocation in Ukraine, a false flag, to justify an intervention – a concern that has heightened following false claims by Putin this week that there was “genocide” against Russians in Donbas. The UK supported US intelligence claims that Russia was considering making a “very graphic” video showing a faked drone attack to justify military intervention. “We are trying to expose Russian intent,” said one anonymous western official on Friday. They argued that any embarrassment from being wrong would be a small price to pay if Ukraine was not attacked. Nevertheless, bandying about intelligence assessments in the public domain can be fraught with difficulties. They are usually based around simple, headline-worthy conclusions – judging that a Russian attack was “highly likely”, as the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said last weekend. But often these come with little or no supporting evidence, making it hard to convince a public who can still remember the exaggerated accusations made about Saddam Hussein’s Iraq in the run-up to the 2003 war. Russia, too, is ready to exploit misjudgments. This week Kremlin officials gleefully pointed out that no invasion of Ukraine came on Wednesday after some unwisely precise predictions had emerged from the US over the weekend. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova called on western media “to publish the schedule for our upcoming invasions for the year” so that she could plan her holidays. Yet the reality is that in the era of social media, full of analysts and commentators making their own judgments about satellite imagery and online videos, relative silence for Britain’s secretive intelligence community is not an option. “Communications and the information space is one of those areas you have to contest,” said one Whitehall insider, one Dad’s Army-style visual a time.",News/World news,Ukraine crisis brings British intelligence out of the shadows,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/18/ukraine-crisis-bring-british-intelligence-out-of-the-shadow-warning-russian-invasion-information-war-with-kremlin
2/19/2022,"A woman who stole £4.2m worth of diamonds by swapping them for pebbles has been ordered to pay back less than £250.  Lulu Lakatos, 60, is serving a five-and-a-half year jail sentence after she was found guilty of conspiracy to steal in 2021. Southwark crown court heard she posed as “Anna”, a gem expert, in order to steal seven stones from the Mayfair jewellers Boodles, after being sent to value them on behalf of supposed wealthy buyers. The diamonds were to be placed in a padlocked purse and held in the store’s vault until funds were transferred. CCTV footage from the firm’s basement showed the moment the purse was put into Lakatos’s handbag and switched for a duplicate by an accomplice in 2016. Less than three hours after the switch, Lakatos and her accomplices fled the UK for France. When the purse in the Boodles safe was opened the following day, inside were seven small garden pebbles. The real diamonds have never been recovered. A proceeds of crime hearing on Friday was told Romanian-born Lakatos, from Saint-Brieuc, Brittany, is expected to be extradited back to France. Judge Alexander Milne QC said: “As far as the figures are concerned, there is a striking contrast between the benefit figure of £4,299,671 and the available assets of €293.57[£244].” Since the money has already been seized, he set a one-day default sentence with a month to pay. Christophe Stankovic and Mickael Jovanovic, who were involved in the plot, were jailed for three years and eight months after pleading guilty to conspiracy to steal. Prosecutors said it was the highest-value theft of its kind ever committed in the UK. Lakatos was wanted in Switzerland for an almost identical plot, where an envelope containing €400,000 was switched for a duplicate filled with paper. Lakatos has three previous convictions for theft in France. She arrived in London the day before the theft and was seen on CCTV with Georgeta Danila, 53, entering the Cricklewood Lodge hotel in London, before making a reconnaissance trip to Boodles with Stankovic and Jovanovic. Danila was acquitted after telling a jury she had no idea she had been involved in the crime.",News/UK news,Diamond thief must pay back £244 after record £4.2m heist ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/18/diamond-thief-must-pay-back-244-after-record-42m-heist
2/19/2022,"If Boris Johnson’s recent reshuffle had an overarching purpose it was to show Conservative MPs that a beleaguered prime minister was listening to them. This is the perspective in which the most eye-catching ministerial move, the appointment of Jacob Rees-Mogg as minister for “Brexit opportunities”, should also primarily be seen. Mr Johnson wants his MPs to be reassured that his faith in Brexit is undiminished and that he has installed another ardent leaver at his side after the departure of Lord Frost. What is less clear, though, is exactly what Mr Rees-Mogg is there to do. He has not simply taken over from Lord Frost, whose responsibility for negotiations with the EU was transferred to the foreign secretary, Liz Truss. But Mr Rees-Mogg’s extended job title gives a clue; in addition to his Brexit promotion role, he is also in charge of “government efficiency”. Mr Johnson is said to have told him to draft an action plan with “1,000 regulations we want to get rid of”.  What might these burdensome regulations actually be? On the Cabinet Office website, there is still a blank under the heading “Responsibilities”. On his first day in his new post, Mr Rees-Mogg was reduced to writing an article in the Sun in which he asked readers to suggest EU regulations that they would like to see abolished. But, in the same article, he made clear that his own view of “Brexit opportunities” is largely about economic and financial deregulation. He wants, he wrote, to lead a drive to scrap “obsolete laws”, to diverge from EU rules, and to cut “the red tape that binds your hands”. This is familiar stuff from the referendum campaign. But in nearly six years since the vote it has proved a vacuous and dishonest approach to policy. The reality of Brexit – in farming, fishing, road haulage, housebuilding, medicines and care homes among others, to say nothing of commercial links with Northern Ireland – has been more law, more rules and more red tape, not less. All derive from Mr Johnson’s desire to appease fanatics like Mr Rees-Mogg by leaving the free trading arrangements of the EU. At the end of January, the government produced a glossy 105-page publication called The Benefits of Brexit. The report is full of inflated and unsubstantiated claims. It celebrates four categories of change as the clear benefits of Brexit which are in fact no such thing: some are changes which the UK could have made as an EU member; others are indeed a result of Brexit but are disadvantages; a third group are unlikely ever to be made for practical and competitive reasons; and there is a final category that, as Professor Stephen Weatherill of Oxford University puts it, offers “little more than pie in the sky”. Mr Rees-Mogg’s own view of “Brexit opportunities” is deregulatory. His goal is to reduce legal controls on employers, markets and wealth. This is perhaps not surprising given that he is a major shareholder in an investment firm, Somerset Capital, which specialises in the emerging markets in which he is now tasked with finding “Brexit opportunities” for Britain. But this is at odds with Mr Johnson’s commitments to levelling up and to higher levels of government spending. Mr Rees-Mogg’s appointment may primarily be aimed at stopping Conservative backbenchers from ousting the prime minister. But he could do a lot of serious social damage in this role too.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Jacob Rees-Mogg: opportunities to do damage | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/18/the-guardian-view-on-jacob-rees-mogg-opportunities-to-do-damage
