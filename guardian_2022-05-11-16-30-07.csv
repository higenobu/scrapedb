5/11/2022,"The New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, says his government will not introduce a congestion charge but researchers are calling for the major road transport reform not to be ruled out so quickly. “There is no plan for a congestion tax and and we can rule it out completely,” he told reporters on Wednesday. The proposal to introduce a London-style congestion charge in Sydney was revealed in leaked cabinet documents obtained by Nine newspapers and was among several plans to reform how the state manages its road network. Under the plan charges would be applied to drivers who enter a 20 sq km area around inner-city Sydney or would be imposed at certain times to reshape how and when people travel. A similar charge was introduced in London in 2003 where drivers paid roughly $25 to enter the city centre. The leaked cabinet documents also contained plans to lower speed limits on inner-city streets to 30km/h and reconsider regional speeds, and to change the cost of public transport which has been subsidised. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Perrottet said “there was no plan for a congestion tax and we can rule it out completely”. However, Marion Terrill from the Grattan Institute said the government should not be so quick to rule out the idea. Terrill said the pandemic had pushed people away from public transport and the introduction of electric vehicles meant driving would become less expensive which could result in more car journeys – and more congestion. “Sydney is already quite a car-dependent city,” Terrill said. “A congestion charge is a politically difficult reform but it does tackle head-on the problem of congestion that does have costs for people. “It encourages people to take their trips at a quieter time of day, or get on the bike or walk if that makes sense for the particular trip they are doing. “I would hope it doesn’t get ruled out immediately for lack of political courage it takes to come up with an idea like this and it is given serious consideration.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Terrill said past research showed those in higher income brackets drove the most and the longest, while public transport connected working class people in outlying areas directly to the CBD. New research published by the Australian National University on Wednesday found Australia would fail to meet both its 2030 and 2050 emissions reduction targets if it continued to lag on electrifying its road transport fleet. Left unchecked road transport emissions would represent more than half Australia’s total emissions by 2030.

Electric vehicle drivers in WA will be able to claim a $3,500 rebate on the purchase of an electric or hydrogen vehicle valued up to $70,000 from 10 May – the most generous subsidy in the country. The Clean Energy Car Fund will include $36.5m to provide rebates for the first 10,000 EV drivers in the state and $22.6m will be set aside for the construction of new charging infrastructure across WA. Western Australia will also introduce an electric vehicle user charge with the charge expected to come into force from 1 July 2027 at a base rate of 2.5 cents a kilometre for electric and hydrogen vehicles, and 2 cents a kilometre for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. These rates will rise with inflation. Behyad Jafari from the Electric Vehicle Council said the policy was a “positive” development but “holistic” reform for the road transport system was needed not just in Western Australia but around the country. “What we see in WA is they’re doing some great immediate things, they have this longer term plan for chargers, but in between the now and the then, we need to ask what else we can fix as well,” Jafari said. “We know that pollution has an impact on emissions and public health where that cost right now gets passed on to the taxpayer through the health system. “As we look at things like the congestion charges, like the need to charge people for emissions coming out of their vehicles, an EV charge doesn’t do these things. “We need to have this more evolved discussion about how we pay for our roads in a way that improves emissions.”",News/Australia news,Dominic Perrottet rules out Sydney congestion tax after confidential plans leaked,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/11/dominic-perrottet-rules-out-sydney-congestion-tax-after-confidential-plans-leaked
5/11/2022,"“If Nottingham Forest are promoted to the Premier League and Notts County remain in the National League, would this create the biggest difference in league positions between two local rivals who had played in the same league before?” muses Makoto. Nottingham’s finest last played each other in the league in 1993-94, in what is now the Championship. If Forest are promoted and County stay in the National League, there will be four tiers between the sides. But there is a much quicker example, albeit involving a local rivalry that isn’t quite as intense. “Sheffield United and Chesterfield played in League One in 2016-17,” writes David Taylor. “By the end of 2019-20 United were ninth in the Premier League, Chesterfield 20th in the National League.” Bernd Wilms can see those four tiers and raise them. “There is at least one six-tier difference in Germany: Freiburg,” he writes. “From 1978 to 1982, Freiburger FC (the historically larger club) and SC Freiburg both played in the 2 Bundesliga. By 2009, FFC had fallen to the seventh-tier Landesliga and SCF had reached the Bundesliga.” There are plenty of other five-tier differences in Germany, which Bernd has also highlighted. FC Köln and Fortuna Köln; Hertha Berlin and Tennis Borussia; and VfL Bochum and Wattenscheid 09. “However, this is just counting rivals that were in the Bundesliga or 2 Bundesliga together,” he adds. “If you look at some of the teams that Hertha BSC, 1860 München or MSV Duisburg played during their 1980s stints in the (then third tier) Oberliga, you could probably get even bigger swings today.” Speaking of Duisburg and the Oberliga. “I can offer local rivals MSV Duisburg and Sportfreunde Hamborn 07,” offers Bernd Jatzwauk. “They played each other in the Oberliga Nordrhein at the end of the 1980s. MSV went on to get promotion to the Bundesliga, and played there, for example, in 1997-98, while Hamborn plied their trade as low as the Landesliga Niederrhein, then the seventh tier of German football.” There has also been a six-tier gulf in English football, involving one of the more evocatively named rivalries. “Can I present the Wool City derby?” presents James Mackenzie. “Bradford City and Bradford (Park Avenue) first played in the top flight in 1914. By the time City were in the Premier League, BPA were in the Northern Premier League, or tier seven.” But all of these pale in comparison to the chasm that once existed in the BB1 postcode area. “Local rivals Darwen and Blackburn Rovers were both in the old First Division in the 1893-94 season,” explains Alun Thomas. “Darwen folded at the end of the 2008-09 season when they were in the North West Counties League Division 1 (level 10) and Blackburn were in the Premier League.” “Due to the odd number of teams in the National League this year, King’s Lynn Town finished their season a week before everyone else, on 7 May. At that point, Stockport County still had three matches left. Has any other team finished their league season when another team in the same division still had three or more games to play?” asks Ian Waterhouse. They have indeed, and it involves one of the greater escapes of the pre-Premier League era. “In 1984-85, Coventry played four games after the scheduled final day, and needed to win the last three to escape relegation from the old First Division,” mails Richard Askham. “They did so, relegating Norwich, who’d completed their fixtures when Coventry still had three to play. It was events like this – and an infamous game between Coventry and Bristol City in 1976-77 – that eventually prompted the leagues to play the final matches of the season at the same time.” Fixture congestion comes from postponements, which makes certain parts of the world more susceptible than others. “The Scottish winter tends to play havoc with Highland League fixtures, leaving a lot of mopping up to do at the end of the season,” writes Jen Turner. “An extreme example came in 2017-18, when Buckie Thistle, Clauchnacuddin and Inverurie Loco Works were the only clubs to finish their campaigns on schedule, at which point Brora Rangers and Fort William each had five games in hand.” Finally, this is a belting bit of trivia from John Shirley. “In 1978-79 (Division 3) Mansfield played five home games after the season-end date of 5 May,” writes John. “The games were on the 7, 11, 14, 19 and 21 May. Four clubs finished their fixtures on 5 May.” In last week’s Knowledge, we looked at extreme examples of lower-league teams in huge stadiums and vice versa. And there are plenty more … “Wakefield AFC play at the 7,000-capacity Millennium Stadium, home of Featherstone Rovers,” writes Kevin Storey. “They are at level 11 in the Sheffield and Hallamshire League, but look like they’ll be promoted.” As with this week’s first question, Bernd Wilms is on the case. “Germany’s 3 Liga was a treasure trove for these (and has been for some time) as relatively strict ground licensing regulations meet with relatively poor promoted clubs. This season gave us: Türkgücü München playing home fixtures at the Olympic Stadium (capacity 60,000), average gate 1,376, lowest gate 388 v Zwickau TSV Havelse playing home fixtures at the HDI Arena in Hannover (capacity 49,000), average gate 1,136, lowest gate 210 v Freiburg II Freiburg II playing at the Dreisamstadion (capacity 24,000) – they generally drew over 1,000 when not capacity-restricted due to Covid .” Christian Schmidt highlights 1 FC Nürnberg, currently in the 2 Bundesliga, who play in the Max-Morlock-Stadium – which has a capacity of 50,000. “In fact, out of the 16 biggest German football stadiums, five have teams in the second tier and two in the third,” writes Christian. “And the 17th biggest is Vestische in Gladbeck, capacity 37,000. That’s bigger than half the current Bundesliga stadiums. Yet it has never had a professional team. The home team (SV Zweckel) are currently in the eighth tier, and in acute danger of dropping into the ninth.” From Germany to Italy, and one of David Platt’s old haunts. “Bari’s San Nicola stadium was built for Italia 90,” writes Jake Barnes, “and with a capacity of over 58,000 is the third-biggest football stadium in Italy – behind only San Siro in Milan and the Olimpico in Rome. In 2018 Bari were demoted from Serie B to Serie D, Group I for ‘financial problems’. That meant they were often playing regional teams, some from towns with a population that is five times smaller than the capacity of San Nicola. Attendances averaged 10,000, meaning there were regularly around 50,000 empty seats. It’s been a painful ride, and I know from first-hand experience – I am a Bari season-ticket holder.” Ian King wasn’t a season-ticket holder for Thames AFC in the 1930s, but he knows a lot about them. “Briefly league members in the early 1930s, they played at the West Ham Stadium in Custom House, which held 120,000 people,” he writes. “In December 1930, they set a record-low league attendance of 469 for a game against Luton Town.” Good luck beating that. “According to my records, in June 1951, Fluminense beat Arsenal 2-0 and Portsmouth 2-1 in Rio de Janeiro,” wrote Jose Sette in 2004. “Can anyone tell me more details about what these clubs were doing here in Brazil?” Both Arsenal and Portsmouth visited Brazil for a series of friendlies in 1951 and between them managed no more than a couple of victories in about 10 games. As well as Fluminense, they faced Botafogo, Sao Paulo, Palmeiras and Vasco de Gama. Apparently, on returning to England, Arsenal sent a letter to Fluminense paying homage to “the team who plays the best football in Brazil”. “Fulham and Norwich last played each other in the league in 2017-18, and have avoided each other by swapping divisions at the end of each of the four seasons since. What is the longest such continuous sequence?” asks Iain Mew. It’s been 100 league matches since Leyton Orient scored a penalty. Is that a record? If not, what’s the longest such run? “Aleksandar Mitrovic’s goal tally in the Championship this season is 43 but I wonder which player has scored most goals overall in football’s second tiers?” wonders Bogdan Kotarlic. “I’ve just seen that Scott Arfield of Rangers has made 100 league appearances for four different clubs (Falkirk, Huddersfield, Burnley, Rangers). Is this a record, or has someone done this with five?” ponders Jesse Pajwani. @TheKnowledge_GU Just thinking that Steve Evans at Stevenage has 8/9 of the letters of the football club he manages in his own name. Is this the closest a manager has come to spelling out the club with his own name? “Burnley v Aston Villa had two English managers facing one another, which is relatively rare in the Premier League these days. But more interesting, they were two scouse managers. When did that last happen?” writes Dom Parry.

5/11/2022,"Lenny Taylor made only a single fleeting appearance for Manchester United’s vaunted 1992 FA Youth Cup victors and never played professionally but he remains enchanted by his experience at the club. Taylor was released by Alex Ferguson days after David Beckham, Gary Neville, Nicky Butt and Ryan Giggs led Eric Harrison’s starlets to the 6-3 aggregate triumph over Crystal Palace that was the launchpad for their stellar careers. Yet 30 years later, and with close to 60,000 tickets sold for Wednesday’s final of the 2022 edition at Old Trafford between United and Nottingham Forest, Taylor exudes pride at a journey that began at a trial as a Birmingham schoolboy. “I was chosen for a mass game in Nuneaton,” he says. “I was a right-back and we all played a half each and Ferguson was there. We had a little conversation afterwards – it was around Valentine’s Day so we cracked a few jokes about that. I signed YTS forms, went and watched a United game and it did wow me – I met some of the players and started to think: ‘Hang on. This is completely different.’” Taylor took digs near United’s old training ground. “Around the corner from The Cliff, just off Lower Broughton Road,” he says. “Robbie Savage stayed there, and there was also Colin Telford, Giuliano Maiorana, Andy Rammell, Roger Sallis, Colin McKee.” Ferguson’s renowned network of informants stretched to Taylor’s landlady, who one night caught him using a novel way to gain entry. “Up a drainpipe,” he says. “No one was answering the door. It was late and everyone was sound asleep and I thought: ‘You know what? The lads are in bed so they’ll hear me if I’m tapping the window.’ They did and let me in. By that time, the landlady had caught me and I was reported. Eric Harrison pulled me in and the gaffer had a few words with me.” There was an escape, though, when Ferguson stormed an infamous party at Lee Sharpe’s house in Altrincham at which Giggs was an attendee too. Taylor says: “Me, John O’Kane, and Raph Burke [all trainees] were upstairs and heard a voice and realised it was the gaffer. We were like: ‘Oh, crap.’ He was bawling, kicking everyone out. Then, he says: ‘Right, is there anyone upstairs?’ We all looked at one another and thought: ‘Oh, shit, please don’t come up.’ We couldn’t wait for him to go so we could get our arses home.” The Scot was as diligent regarding on-field development. “If he wasn’t there personally, he’d be on the phone or get information from Eric or Nobby [Stiles, another coach] because he’d say: ‘I heard you had a great game,’” Taylor says. Stiles was a United legend who won the championship, FA Cup and European Cup at the club and was in England’s triumphant 1966 World Cup side. “We were very fortunate to have him,” says Taylor. “His mentality was beyond belief. There were times where he put us in our place and got a bit frustrated, but he wanted the best for us. He’d pull us aside, sometimes other lads, especially defenders like John O’Kane, and Gaz [Neville]. Sometimes he’d have a little one-on-one with us and say: ‘This is how you should approach things.’” Of a crop that also featured Paul Scholes and whose best players formed the nucleus of a United team that dominated domestic football, Taylor selects Giggs as the force. “Even at that age, you go: ‘Wow.’ You couldn’t mark him because of his awareness and pure pace. But don’t get me wrong, he didn’t like coming up against me in training.” Of the vaunted quintet who, with Phil Neville, became known as the Class of 92, Taylor says: “We didn’t think anything of them then. It was: ‘Let’s get training, win games.’ When you put on that jersey you’re playing in a cup final every day.” Giggs became United’s record appearance holder, playing 963 times. Gary Neville was made captain by Ferguson in the mid-2000s. By then Beckham was England’s leader and Butt had been selected in the 2002 Fifa World Cup team of the tournament. Phil Neville enjoyed 11 years in the first team. Although Scholes has a claim to be the finest of the six he did not feature in the Youth Cup run. “It sounds silly,” Taylor says. “But he had a few issues with his shin or his knees. Once these were over, you could tell he would be some player. He was cheeky – would have a smile for you if he pinged the ball a certain way or controlled it a certain way.” Taylor’s moment came in the semi-final second leg against Tottenham at White Hart Lane where a 2-1 win took United to the final. “Eric brought me on in the last few minutes and apologised for leaving it so late. I said: ‘Don’t worry.’ I’m not 100% sure if I even touched the ball – I probably did – but I was glad to be part of the team.” Taylor departed after the final. He says: “It was a bit soul-destroying. Eric mentioned Peter Reid [Manchester City’s manager] might be interested but nothing happened. I went to Port Vale for a trial and nothing happened either. Walsall were interested in taking me for a year but I declined. Maybe it was the wrong decision but I didn’t have someone advising me. I ended up going to Solihull Borough. I was there for about three years, but I was mainly in their reserves. “I was trying to work shifts and train and play, and in the end I said: ‘I’ve had enough.’ I went on to do what everyone else does: survive. I was about 28, 29. Since then I’ve worked in a metal coating factory, done labouring for an electrical company.” There is no bitterness though. “I had my crack,” says Taylor. “I said to my mum: ‘I apologise, I wish I could have made it so I could take care of you and all my family and friends.’ She said: ‘Don’t worry, son. You did yourself proud and that’s all we can ask for.’ I tell my 10-year-old daughter, Cyann, that. ‘Do yourself proud. If you’re down, pick yourself up.’” Taylor remains grateful. “We achieved as a group, whether I played in the final or not,” he says. “And some got in the first team, some made history: trebles, titles, FA Cup wins, Super Cup wins, European Cup wins. I was very lucky to be part of what led to that.” With his partner, Tina, Taylor is now a carer for her son, who has autism. “There are days when I think: ‘Ah, it’s such a shame.’ But you know what? Try and put a smile on your face and be a kinder person. What I experienced can’t be taken away from me ever.”",Sport/Football,Lenny Taylor: the forgotten man of Manchester United’s Class of 92,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/11/lenny-taylor-manchester-united-class-of-92-ferguson
5/11/2022,"An “explosion” in a food allergy poses a particular risk to vegans and vegetarians, one of Britain’s leading experts has warned. Cases of pollen food syndrome (PFS) have risen markedly in recent years as a result of global heating, worsening pollution and changes in pollen patterns, Dr Isabel Skypala said. Attacks of PFS are usually triggered by eating raw nuts, fruit and vegetables. However, they can also be prompted by foods popular among people who avoid animal products, such as soya milk, avocados, jackfruit, edamame beans and smoothies. The estimated 13 million Britons who are allergic to pollen, especially birch tree pollen, and suffer from hay fever are most at risk. PFS is caused by unstable pollen antibodies found in proteins in some raw – but not cooked – fruits and vegetables, nuts and soya. Skypala, the only consultant allergy dietician in the NHS, said: “The last research into the prevalence of PFS in Britain, which I undertook in 2008, showed that 2% of adults had it, including 4% of people in London. I suspect that it has probably doubled since then. “In my clinic at the Royal Brompton hospital in London about five out of every 10 people I see has PFS, whereas 10 years [ago] it might have been two. There’s a perfect storm of increasing PFS at the same time as you have a very great increase in people eating fruits and vegetables.” It is someone’s inherent sensitivity to pollen, rather than the fact they follow a meat-free diet, that puts them at risk, added Skypala. Most sufferers experience only mild symptoms such as itching or tingling in or around their mouth. However, growing numbers experience nausea, vomiting and even difficulty breathing because their throat swells up. “While a lot of people with PFS are having a mild reaction, severe reactions are more frightening and more dangerous,” she said. Skypala said PFS sufferers often end up very nervous about what they eat. “A PFS reaction, mild or severe, makes people extremely anxious, and they often cut out all fruit and nuts, because they are worried about having another reaction.” The surge in cases is adding to the pressure on the NHS. However, specialist services are under-resourced so patients often wait months to be seen, she added. Skypala has drawn up a new set of clinical guidelines for the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology. These also advise doctors how to differentiate PFS from a nut allergy, with which it is often confused. The Anaphylaxis Campaign said foods that can trigger PFS include raw apples, pears, kiwi fruits, strawberries, plums, cherries, cherry tomatoes, celery and carrot. Frozen fruit or vegetables can still provoke a reaction, and peeling potatoes or other root vegetables can lead to itching or swelling in the hands and eyes. “The rising prevalence of PFS comes at a time when there is a worldwide change in dietary habits, with more people adopting a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle. A vegan/vegetarian diet may also include soy and jackfruit, both of which can provoke severe PFS reactions,” the charity added. Margaret Kelman, a specialist nurse at Allergy UK, said: “The psychological effect of having PFS, especially where multiple foods are being avoided, can not only greatly restrict the diet but also can lead to anxiety and fear, and impact on an individual’s ability to carry out daily tasks.” Sufferers should stop eating the trigger food, rise their mouth with water, take an antihistamine medication if they find that helps, and try eating some of the foods baked or roasted instead, she added.",News/Society,Vegetarian and vegan diets linked to UK rise in raw food allergy,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/11/vegetarian-and-vegan-diets-linked-to-uk-rise-in-raw-food-allergy
5/11/2022,"Sometimes I see it in the big moments; often it’s in the small. The fact that Oz (our black-and-white lurcher) would rather sleep under the kitchen table when I’m writing, even though the sofa is by far the comfier option. The way he rolls on to his back when I greet him each morning, exposing his chasmic armpits for a tickle. Or the way he makes sure to lick and nibble both of my earlobes, left then right, with snuffling gusto. What other word is there to describe these joyful moments than love? I can barely bring myself to say it. I’m a science writer and science writers aren’t supposed to use human words such as love when referring to animal behaviours. The word is too contextual – too subjective. It’s just not scientific enough, the wisdom goes. And so, we are taught to use the word “attachment” when referring to closely bonded animal relationships instead. Thus, Oz is very attached to us. That’s what I should have written. But it all feels a bit bland, doesn’t it? Why can’t we label what some – but not all – dogs feel for us as love? After all, that’s what it seems to be. Researching the topic, it wasn’t the strength of a single study that convinced me of this. It was the breadth. That the emotional centres of dog brains (observable through functional magnetic resonance imaging scans) light up like human brains when we are reunited with family members. That the same hormones and neurotransmitters that power the positive emotional responses that humans in close relationships feel, also seem to rise predictably (and repeatably) in dogs during their interactions with us. That dogs behave, in the presence of strangers, just like human children gathering around their caregivers for security. That dogs, quite literally, have sociality written upon their genes. This is new ground for me as a science writer. I have long believed the concept of grief in animals should be used with caution, for example. But something about dogs and the breadth of these new scientific discoveries makes me think the word “attachment” just isn’t good enough to describe the unique relationship that has coevolved in this context. “Attachment” is too broad a term. And, like “love”, the word is still suggestive. After all, I am attached to this laptop. I’ve had it a while and I like it a lot. Likewise, I am attached to my favourite slippers. In fact, I am attached to all sorts of things. And yet, my relationship with my dog is something else entirely. So, for now, I’m going with love. And my hope is that it might encourage us to reflect on our relationship with dogs and the way that they are treated by us. Because if dogs can love us, then isn’t the responsibility on us to treat them with the emotional care and consideration they deserve? My hope is that a more liberal use of the L-word among scientists and decision-makers might encourage us to do more to secure the welfare of dogs. If the government can accept that animals are sentient (an acknowledgment that was removed from law post-Brexit and has subsequently been put back) why not accept, scientifically, that dogs can love us? After all, sentience is, to a degree, no less subjective than love. There may be benefits to this subtle shift in language. Accepting that dogs can love us might give a much-needed boost to the government’s commitment to clamping down on puppy farms. It might nudge the government to take more seriously illegal ear-cropping (reported cases have gone up by more than 600% in recent years). Or encourage the government to finally get around to tackling the overbreeding of flat-faced dogs, which can go on to suffer obstructed breathing and heart disease. Perhaps a formal declaration of love might encourage the government to curb the number of dogs used in experimental procedures. And so, if the L-word finds its way into our everyday scientific vernacular, I’d be broadly supportive. Anything that helps communicate more effectively the strength of the unique bond we have with dogs and the responsibility we have in ensuring it continues to prosper. Love is, after all, a scientific descriptive for the small moments that many of us see in our dogs each day: the frequent gazing; the excited tail that wags like a helicopter blade on our return.

5/11/2022,"Late afternoon, Friday 27 January 1922. The sky unzipped and snow began to fall in Washington DC. It came down steadily all night and right through the next day, shrouding the city. Trains were evacuated, cars abandoned in the street. By 8pm on Saturday, 28 inches had fallen. Undaunted, 300 citizens decided to brave the translated streets to see the silent film Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford at Crandall’s Knickerbocker theatre, a picture house so luxurious that the chairs in the orchestra pit were upholstered in silk. The audience howled as Wallingford sat on a tack. A second later the entire roof collapsed under the accumulated weight of snow, coming down in a single slab of stone and steel and crushing the people below. Ninety-eight died and more were mutilated or injured. This sounds like the very definition of an act of God, but the coroner’s hearing concluded that the disaster was a consequence of faulty design on the part of the architect, Reginald Geare, who had failed to correctly recalculate the load-bearing capacity of steel after the contractor, Harry Crandall, insisted on a last-minute change to cheaper material. Five years later, Geare took his own life. In 1937 Crandall too killed himself. In his heyday, he had run a whole chain of cinemas, and in a letter explaining his decision, he wrote: “Only it is I’m despondent, and miss my theaters, oh so much.” Everyone fails every day, but an architect’s failure is inescapably visible, a public humiliation, even when it doesn’t occasion loss of life. To make a building that doesn’t work, that’s regarded as ugly, or runs vastly over budget, isn’t just painful and embarrassing. Architects have to master material reality in a way that functions practically, not just aesthetically. What they make outlives them, so their disgrace is accompanied by the knowledge that it cannot easily be erased, but stands instead as a public epitaph. Perhaps this explains why certain buildings are dogged by rumours concerning the architect’s suicide. That the relationship between creator and creation can become so deleterious is a source of obsession for Charlotte Van den Broeck, a young Belgian poet. “My real question is: What makes a mistake larger than life, so all-encompassing that your life itself becomes a failure? Where is the line between creator and creation?” She visits 13 architectural failures, an elegant conceit. All are by men (no mention, say, of Lota de Macedo Soares, the Brazilian architect and partner of the poet Elizabeth Bishop, neither of whom were strangers to creative disaster). Her investigation takes her from a faulty swimming pool in her home town of Turnhout, in Antwerp, all the way to Colorado Springs. There’s the “perfect, perfect” Vienna State Opera, subject to such an unrelenting hate campaign in the press that one of the two architects, Eduard van der Nüll, killed himself. There’s Pine Valley in New Jersey, now the most exclusive golf course on the planet, which ran so far over budget and was so inhospitable to grass that its creator – you get the picture. And there’s Fort George in Ardersier, whose chief engineer is supposed to have rowed out into the Moray firth to admire his finished creation, only to end it all there and then when he caught sight of a chimney and realised his hidden fort was visible from the water. This last, of course, is pure myth. William Skinner, the engineer in question, died at his drafting table on Christmas Day 1780, decades after the fort was completed. Nearly half the stories Van den Broeck uncovers similarly dissolve away. The death in question happened later, or as a consequence of bereavement, or for reasons that cannot truly be pieced together (little is said here about mental ill-health or early life adversity). Slowly, it becomes clear that this isn’t really a book about architecture at all. The central character isn’t Francesco Borromini, the genius of the baroque, or the visionary Lamont Young, who wished to create a miniature Venice in Naples, but rather Van den Broeck herself. The subject isn’t twisted church towers and sinking swimming pools so much as a melodramatic and hyper-personal topography of creativity, a landscape that for Van den Broeck appears seamed with danger and fraught with risk. Never mind the hundreds of thousands of artists whose work does not destroy them but serves as a source of pleasure and joy. Surely the ones who die in misery, flat broke, reveal the truth of creativity’s sinister contract. Lest all this sound too glum, it’s a road trip, too: libraries in a sundress, fried chicken at a diner, wisdom from a passing waitress. The dead architects are set against a chorus of living women Van den Broeck encounters on her travels: Airbnb hosts and Uber drivers whose scepticism about her calling serves as a robust plainsong in counterpoint to her own aria on the exalted peril of the artist’s life. In Naples, Giulia cooks her an elaborate dinner and then startles her by asking for money to cover the groceries. Imagine creative labour having a price! Browsing in a used book store in Washington DC, Van den Broeck buys a copy of Oranges by John McPhee, a classic of reportage. “My hope is to learn from him how to be less present in the book I’m trying to write … he’s anything but a runaway extra blocking the view of his own subject matter.” I think it’s safe to say that McPhee himself might have excised this scene. Bold Ventures more closely resembles a pop version of Iain Sinclair’s psychogeography or Out of Sheer Rage, Geoff Dyer’s anti-biography of DH Lawrence; works in which the author is present and the journey lists inward. There’s no law against finding yourself interesting. The real structural flaw here – a misplaced strut, a failure to calculate load-bearing capacity – is to do with a kind of imaginative overreach. As the desire to build a romance of creativity exceeds Van den Broeck’s interest in her real cast, their status as props becomes uncomfortably clear. One, she admits, bores her. “Yes, I’d like it to be true. His alleged suicide would at least lift him out of his colourless slot in history.” Others require embellishment. In what appears to be a fictionalised episode, the cinema architect, Geare, is given a horrifying recurring dream of a young boy, caught in the wreckage of the theatre. This is a poet’s touch, to trim a scene from a newspaper and insert it into a real person’s psyche, but I’m not sure how easily it sits with the desire “to rehabilitate those architects, to pick up their lost faces and stick them back in place”. There’s such a thing as too much creativity, I guess.  Olivia Laing’s latest book is Everybody: A Book About Freedom (Chatto).

5/11/2022,"Good morning. Wow, the Queen’s speech is weird, isn’t it? Black Rod! An MP who gets taken hostage at Buckingham Palace (sort of)! Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer making polite small talk and pretending they aren’t trying to destroy each other’s careers! The actual content of the speech – which sets out the government’s legislative programme for the next parliamentary session – was also pretty surreal: Prince Charles, standing in for his mother, began by saying that the government’s priority was “to grow and strengthen the economy and help ease the cost of living for families”. He then gave an 874-word speech that had almost nothing to say about either of those things, but plenty on “street votes” to stop your neighbour’s extension and disrupting environmental protests. For this morning’s newsletter, I spoke to Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, about the scale of the cost of living crisis that went ignored, and what the government’s programme is missing that might help to fix it. That’s right after the headlines. Brexit | The government is seriously considering unilaterally tearing up parts of the Northern Ireland protocol after the Democratic Unionist party made it a condition of resuming power sharing at Stormont. Theresa May warned that doing so could harm Britain’s international reputation. Social media | Twitter’s ban on the former US president Donald Trump will be reversed by Elon Musk if he completes a takeover of the social media platform, the billionaire Tesla boss said. Musk called the decision “morally bad”. Ukraine | President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said his country’s forces are pushing Russian troops back in Kharkiv. Meanwhile Ukraine said it would suspend the flow of Russian gas through the country to Europe. Coronavirus | Doctors are re-emphasising the importance of Covid vaccination during pregnancy after a study found that vaccines not only protect expectant mothers, but also reduce the risk of stillbirth by 15%. Media | The prominent libel case between Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy, dubbed the ‘‘Wagatha Christie” trial, began with Vardy saying she deeply regrets unflattering personal remarks about Peter Andre in a newspaper interview. The cost of living crisis has become such a fixture in British political conversation that the phrase might begin to obscure the increasing poverty behind it. The typical household’s income will drop by about £1,000 in the coming year, and the poorest are least insulated from the impact by savings. That’s before the worst of the impact of inflation and spiralling energy bills even gets here. A new report published this morning by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research finds that 1.5m households across the UK will have food and energy bills greater than their disposable income in the next year. “It’s big families, and, increasingly, disabled households, where you’re seeing a lot of poverty,” says Torsten Bell, whose thinktank is focused on raising living standards for those on low and middle incomes. “When you listen to people on the lowest incomes, they’re already reporting struggling to pay their bills, making trade-offs they wouldn’t normally.” Here are some of the key takeaways from what the Queen’s speech had to say – and didn’t have to say – about it. Significant measures on the cost of living are being delayed The promise of help might have made the top of the speech read by Prince Charles – but in interviews, government ministers say frankly that we won’t see serious measures to soften the impact of inflation for months. “The autumn is when the cost of living is going to be most particularly in focus,” Treasury minister Simon Clarke told the BBC. Earlier, policing minister Kit Malthouse said that spending measures are “really for a budget rather than a Queen’s speech.” Of course, there’s nothing to stop measures like help on benefits being introduced sooner if the chancellor wants to do so. The bottom line, says Bell, is that “The Queen’s speech won’t make any material difference on the immediate squeeze households are facing. This is not the government trying, despite the pre-briefing, to solve the cost of living crisis.” Even the Daily Mail agrees, albeit arguing for tax cuts rather than benefit increases: “[Rishi] Sunak must not leave it too late,” its leader says today. “Struggling families need help right now.” Boris Johnson did project a sense of urgency yesterday – telling the House of Commons that there would be “more on this in the days to come”. But shortly afterwards, a Treasury source said they didn’t know what he was talking about. We’re starting from behind The delay is to coincide with a rise in the cap on energy bills due in September. Waiting for the budget to take bold steps, preserving as much headroom as possible to deal with any increases in the cost of borrowing in the meantime, might make sense in normal circumstances, says Bell. The trouble is, “there is a pattern in this crisis of being behind the curve. Everyone was warning at Christmas that this was going to be the biggest story of the year.” The measures in the spring statement “spread the jam wide” and “didn’t prioritise supporting those in real trouble”; meanwhile, a 3% rise in benefits has already been outstripped by the stunning rise in inflation – which looks like it will amount to a real-terms cut of about £11bn. So those who are most in need are already struggling to make ends meet. “You need to get on with it – there is a real cost to people on low incomes in not telling them what help you’re going to give,” said Bell. “People cut back because they’re scared about getting impossible bills in the winter months.” There are measures a Conservative government could take today As Richard Partington explained in First Edition a fortnight ago, the benefits system remains the most efficient way to help those who need it. “We already know we’re going to be increasing benefits by a very large amount next April,” said Bell. “We need to do that immediately.” And if this is simply brought forward rather than repeated, “it’s perfectly possible to provide more targeted support now without increasing spending indefinitely.” That’s not something you’d expect to see in the Queen’s speech, because it doesn’t require a new piece of legislation – but it would be possible to do it right away. “These debates are definitely live in the Treasury,” Bell said. “They’re thinking about both the principle and the practicalities of doing this.” Growth is a crucial part of the solution The government’s other point of emphasis in the Queen’s speech was on measures to stimulate economic growth – and in the long-term that has to be part of the solution, too, Bell says. He points out that a big part of the current crisis is stagnant wage growth over the previous decade. “We have basically fallen into a trap of low expectations, where low income growth has somehow been normalised and everyone stops thinking about how seriously you can have an impact on that,” he said. “And then when crises come it’s much harder to deal with them.” The Bank of England expects the economy to be just 1% bigger in 2025 than it is today – 6% down on previous expectations. One stark measure of the problem drawn from Bell’s excellent recent piece for the Fabian Society: if income had grown since 2005-6 in line with previous trends, average income in 2025-26 would be £11,000 higher than it is currently projected to be. That’s a difference of 43%. There is a shortage of big ideas – and not only from the government In the Queen’s speech, the government says that its plan for growth is to reduce debt, cut taxes, and “empower local leaders to regenerate their areas”. There’s are optimistic references to a bonfire of regulations and the Brexit dividend. “But the actual substantive measures are very small,” said Bell. “What we do see is the dialling up of traditional Tory deregulation, and the dialling down of ‘red wall’ economics, the idea of making the country a fairer place.” Nor has Labour come up with an effective way to talk about growth when the overall success of the economy is – like it or not – linked more to banking than manufacturing. “Even if you thought in previous eras the job of the left was simply to ensure that the gains of the growing economy were spread, nobody should think that’s enough for the left in 2022,” Bell said. And this isn’t a temporary problem. “It’s mad, the idea that the cost of living is a thing for this year, and then it’ll be gone – it’s for the birds,” he said. “British politics is going to be dominated by this until 2024.” “My overall view is that what it shows is that British politics hasn’t got a lot of ideas at the moment,” he went on. “When you have 1980s inequality with the stagnation of the 2010s coming together, that is a very dangerous place economically, but also for what it does to your society in the medium term. At a time of high inequality and low growth, we’re out of ideas.” Read more on the Queen’s speech “Charles lapsed into silence, the whole event drifting into anticlimax,” John Crace writes in his sketch. “There was nothing here for anyone to get excited by.” The Guardian’s leader: “Instead of dealing with the very real economic problems confronting the country, Mr Johnson’s legislative programme creates political divisions with opponents.” Rafael Behr says that “The volume of bills being proposed, 38 in all, testifies to a lack of focus and purpose. In the absence of one big plan, there are many little plans to look busy.” Peter Walker breaks down those bills and explains what they mean. In the Spectator, Isabel Hardman writes that divisions between Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson are central to problems with the government’s response to the crisis. The news that Roe v Wade may fall this summer has left many feeling dejected, but Melody Schreiber takes a look at the states that are working twice as hard to ensure women’s rights.
