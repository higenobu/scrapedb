3/20/2022,"15 Melvyn Jaminet Dealt with first high ball well, knocked on the next but was not flustered. Has quickly developed into an integral member of this side. 8 14 Damian Penaud Last-ditch tackle on Marchant and showed what an elusive runner he can be in buildup to Dupont’s try. Such a tricky player. 7 13 Gaël Fickou Knock-on after France had prised open England’s defence with a lovely set play but made amends with the opening try soon after. Key turnover too. 8 12 Jonathan Danty Storming run up the middle of the park and one remarkable kick over his shoulder. Another who can be pleased with performances throughout the tournament. 7 11 Gabin Villière Lost first aerial duel with Steward but responded with turnover at the breakdown. Such impressive workrate just never stops. 8 10 Romain Ntamack Clever bouncing pass to Fickou for opening try and showed an authority that rarely wavered amid a packed-out stadium going bonkers. 7 9 Antoine Dupont (capt) Sacked Itoje, who was standing in at scrum-half. Fitting that the skipper ultimately settled a contest he marshalled so well. 9 1 Cyril Baille Such soft hands for a loosehead prop. Genge looked good in parts but Baille is setting new standards in the position. 8 2 Julien Marchand Not too many of his gallops in open field but no complaints about his set piece before Mauvaka took over. 6 3 Uini Atonio Fine performance at tighthead from a consistent performer throughout this championship. Had Genge’s number at the scrum. 8 4 Cameron Woki Enjoyed pitting his wits against Itoje at the lineout and around the field he probably edged that absorbing individual battle. 8 5 Paul Willemse Performs the role of enforcer for France. This feels like the campaign in which he has truly proved he belongs on this stage. 6 6 François Cros Delivered a telling blow just before half-time. Plays a key role in French gameplan of softening up opposing defence. 8 7 Anthony Jelonch Early knock-on but made a bullocking run down the left. Back-row is an area of immense strength for France but Jelonch has justified his coach’s faith. 7 7 Grégory Alldritt Player of the tournament by a distance. Came up with crucial turnovers, tackles, carries and key assist for Dupont’s try. 9 Replacements: Gros (for Baille, 50) Solid 6; Mohamed Haouas (for Atonio, 55) n/a; Romain Taofifénua (for Willemse, 50) Added oomph 6; Thibaud Flament (for Woki, 72) n/a; Dylan Cretin (for Cros, 72) n/a; Maxime Lucu (for Dupont, 77) n/a; Thomas Ramos (for Jaminet, 77) n/a 15 George Furbank You cannot say the gamble paid off. One lovely pass to Nowell on left wing but a brain freeze when gathering Danty’s kick with a foot in touch. 4 14 Freddie Steward Roamed off his wing and had some joy in the air against France’s back three. Finished off a much-needed try too when England were on top. 8 13 Joe Marchant One of England’s best performers. Made some ground up the middle and almost evaded Penaud’s desperate tackle for a try. 7 12 Henry Slade Kept trying to find ways to create gaps in the French defence but rarely found a way though the wall of blue. Forced things a bit too much. 6 11 Jack Nowell Escaped punishment for taking Jaminet out in the air and suffered nasty looking injury that ended his evening with his next attempt. 4 10 Marcus Smith The odd goose step and carried out his instructions when it came to hoisting the ball high. Didn’t always look on same page as those outside him. 5 9 Ben Youngs Laborious at times and struggled to get England going. Kicking was fine, France knew exactly what to expect. Eddie Jones’s scrum-half policy still feels confused. 5 1 Ellis Genge Again gave everything with countless carries in the backfield and some heroic tackling. His scrummaging suffered as a result, though. 7 2 Jamie George Not able to reproduce his heroics against Ireland but it was not for lack of effort. Luke Cowan-Dickie likely to come back into side this summer. 6 3 Will Stuart Praised by Jones for his cameo against Ireland but didn’t reach the same heights here and was withdrawn with more than 30 minutes to go. 5 4 Maro Itoje Always tends to be one of England’s most eye-catching performers and will always exert some influence. France did well to shackle him, however. 7 5 Nick Isiekwe Got the nod in front of Joe Launchbury for his lineout work and few complaints about that. Offered England little else though. 5 6 Courtney Lawes (capt) Never threw in the towel and came to the fore early in the second half as England rallied but, in truth, a comeback was never likely. 6 7 Sam Underhill Largely anonymous in the first half after recall to back row but far more involved in the third quarter, thundering into everything that moved, before he was replaced. 6 8 Sam Simmonds Almost dropped kick-off but settled thereafter. Has rarely managed to find the open spaces he craves throughout this tournament, however. 5 Replacements: Joe Marler (for Genge 65) Scrum did improve 6; Kyle Sinckler (for Stuart 49) A little off the pace 6; Ollie Chessum (for Isiekwe 63) Busy 7; Alex Dombrandt (for Underhill 65) Almost grabbed try with trademark running line 6; Harry Randall (for Youngs 65) Injected tempo 7; George Ford (for Furbank 77) n/a; Elliot Daly (for Nowell 26) Looked bright after another early introduction 6",Sport/Sport,France 25-13 England: Six Nations ratings from the Stade de France,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/19/france-25-13-england-six-nations-ratings-from-the-stade-de-france
3/20/2022,"Having spent the best part of two days in the dirt watching Kraigg Brathwaite chalk up the third longest innings by a West Indian after Brian Lara’s two world records, it is over to England’s batters to see whether they can somehow advance this second Test and force an unlikely win on the final day. The tourists will resume on 40 for no loss and a lead of 136 runs, West Indies having finally been bowled out for 411 from 187.5 overs after tea in reply to 507 for nine declared. Brathwaite led the way for the hosts, not just turning his overnight 109 into 160 but also putting miles into the legs of his opponents. Brathwaite had also refreshed his own attack but inducing some late panic was never going to be easy on this surface. Though one scare followed when Zak Crawley reviewed an lbw decision on two, pinned in front by Kemar Roach only for Hawk-Eye to show it was missing leg stump by a whisker, he and Alex Lees survived 15 overs and will resume a possible charge for quick runs first thing. “Pressure can do funny things,” replied Saqib Mahmood, fresh from figures of two for 58 from 27 overs on debut, when asked if England can claim 10 wickets on day five. “I’ve got my head around putting the bowling boots back on. It’s been hard work so far but that is why we play the game.” It had been a serious slog just to get to this point, with only Lara’s scores of 375 (766 mins) in 1994 and 400 not out (778) 10 years on longer than Brathwaite’s 710-minute innings among Caribbean epics. “This was the first time my mother has watched me play,” revealed the Barbadian right-hander. “Scoring runs is always a great feeling and I’m very happy to get a hundred at home.” The soft-spoken West Indies captain prefers the road less travelled in these parts, having never played a professional game of Twenty20. His occupation is very much occupation and, after the hosts resumed on 288 for four, he ground down his opponents with a remarkable display of concentration that saw him notch up 400 dot balls out of the 489 he faced over two days. Over 200 of these had come out of the hand of Jack Leach and been repelled before the left-arm spinner eventually got one to pitch on middle, rag past a weary defensive shot and kiss the off stump before tea; the relief was palpable, with Root’s attack having already heard the dreaded words “third new ball” by this stage. Brathwaite looked downbeat as he walked off but at 385 for seven in the 169th over it was a case of mission accomplished, having provided the backbone for his side’s reply and doused the spirits of the travelling supporters to the extent that, when Sweet Caroline rung around the ground for the umpteenth time, they barely joined in. Their loudest cheers were arguably those that met the wickets claimed by Mahmood, recognising a wholehearted first outing and the agony he had felt when a maiden Test wicket was scrubbed off on the third day for a no-ball. After a soporific morning of 63 runs and one wicket – Ben Stokes removing nightwatchman Alzarri Joseph after 90 minutes of resistance – it finally came. Though the shot from Jason Holder after lunch was ugly, top-edging a slog, it still took a fine swirling catch from Matthew Fisher to get Mahmood off the mark. “I’m relieved more than anything,” Mahmood later said. “I felt the biggest criminal [after the no-ball]. When I got that one today, I had a little check there were no dramas.” The satisfaction of a simpler second for Mahmood came when Veerasammy Permaul, the No 9, was trapped lbw but this was another day of toil for England’s right-arm fast-mediums with no reverse swing owing to the early moisture on the ball. Fisher, the second debutant on show, was unable to add to his maiden Test wicket claimed way back on the second evening, Ben Stokes was worked the hardest and Chris Woakes was notably ignored for long periods by his captain. A wicket for Woakes eventually came as England picked off the West Indies tail, Roach given out lbw to a ball that was barely scratching leg stump. But it may be that the bowler England viewed as their attack leader on this tour has a breather in next week’s third Test in Grenada unless the floodgates open in the fourth innings. Ollie Robinson and Craig Overton are the spare seamers but if another pitch like this one is prepared, England will consider a second spinner – and another debutant – in Matt Parkinson. Certainly Leach could do with some help, sending down 69.5 overs for figures of three for 118 that were solid enough but also reflected a lack of air on the ball at times and West Indies eschewing risk. That said, the most recent first-class match played at the National Stadium in St George’s saw seamers to the fore and Leeward Islands roll Guyana by an innings in three days; a repeat might not generate the most revenue for the local cricket board but it would be livelier than the fare on offer to date.",Sport/Sport,Resilient Kraigg Brathwaite sets England tough task to win second Test,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/19/resilient-kraigg-brathwaite-sets-england-tough-task-to-win-second-test
3/20/2022,"Gareth Southgate says it is vital that sections of England’s support are given stronger assurances about their safety at the World Cup in Qatar, and that it will be “horrible” if people feel unable to travel because of human rights concerns. Among the many issues clouding this winter’s tournament is the fact that homosexuality is illegal in Qatar, while there are also serious problems surrounding women’s rights. While officials in the country have repeatedly stated that all supporters will be safe, there remains significant disquiet. Southgate explained that he has researched the problems that have caused alarm since Qatar was awarded hosting rights in 2010. “I think I’m quite clear on the areas of concern about this tournament,” he said. “The building of the stadiums was the first, and there’s nothing we can do about that now. They’re built. There are obviously ongoing concerns about the rights of workers and the conditions they live in and those areas. It seems universally accepted that’s better than it was, but not in the position where people think it could be. And maybe policies that have been put in place are not always enforced as they might be. “Then there are the issues that potentially threaten our fans when they travel: the rights of women and the rights of the LGBTQ+ community in particular. Sadly, through discussions that I’ve had, I don’t think some of those communities are going to go and that’s a great shame. “We stand for inclusivity as a team – that’s been the big driver of a lot of the stances we’ve taken in the last couple of years – and it would be horrible to think some of our fans feel they can’t go because they feel threatened or they’re worried about their safety. So there needs to be some clarity and some better communication that they are going to be safe, because they’re not feeling that.” Southgate said his squad, who will face Switzerland and Ivory Coast in friendlies during the forthcoming international break, will be apprised of these issues in particular. “What we’re going to try to do with the players is highlight that we think those are going to be the key areas,” he said. “There might be one or two others too.” The nature of any stand England might make to raise awareness, whether in Qatar or before, remains open to discussion. Denmark are displaying messages critical of Qatar on their training kit and reducing commercial activity around the event; Southgate said any display has to be meaningful but that there is also a limit to what he and his players can do, although talks are continuing. “I’m not sure that just wearing a T-shirt makes a difference,” he said. “I don’t totally know what we can do in every aspect. I think we have to be realistic about what that might be. There are some things we’re not going to be able to affect. Maybe there are some things we can affect; if we can and we think they’re worthwhile, we’ll try to do that. Without a doubt, one of the priorities in my mind is our own fans and how they’re going to be dealt with in particular. “Despite contradictory reports we are in regular contact with the NGOs. There are lots of conversations with organisations like Amnesty, so it’s not correct when they say discussions aren’t taking place. We’re trying to do the best we can. We’re going to get criticism here whatever happens. It won’t be deemed enough but we have always tried to affect things in the right way.” On the pitch Southgate is heartened by the fact that Harry Kane, whose form earlier in the season was a concern, is close to his best again. The England captain has scored seven in as many games at club level, suggesting he has shaken off any malaise brought about by his failed attempt to leave Tottenham last summer. “It’s been good to see Harry scoring,” Southgate said. “He’s always a happier animal when he comes in if he’s been scoring. Physically, the way Antonio [Conte] works and trains the team, I think that will have been good for Harry, to help get the best level out of him.”",Sport/Football,Southgate voices England concerns about human rights at Qatar World Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/19/gareth-southgate-england-human-rights-qatar-world-cup
3/20/2022,"Repudiating any suggestion Manchester City are having a wobble, Pep Guardiola has declared his pride at what his team have already achieved this season and urged them to enjoy the run-in as they pursue trophies on three fronts. City’s lead over Liverpool at the top of the Premier League has been trimmed from 14 points to one and they have failed to score in their past two matches in all competitions, a drought by their standards. On Sundaythey face a testing FA Cup sixth-round tie at particularly pesky opponents, with Southampton having drawn with them twice in the league this season. Guardiola says he wants his players to relish the high stakes. “These are the moments why we are here,” he said. “This is why we watched the Champions League draw together [on Friday]. We have fought since pre-season to arrive here. It makes me happy. Everyone wants to win already but the run we have been on to be where we are now makes me so proud. My expectations are so high but, at the same time, during the process I am satisfied. “We went to Peterborough [in the last round of the FA Cup] and we won and now we are going to Southampton. I congratulate the players and say ‘well done, good job’. Because I know how difficult it is. “I try to say to the club ‘enjoy these moments during the season. Don’t wait to win the Premier League, the Champions League or the FA Cup to be happy. Enjoy the day, enjoy the moment. “Like in Europe, enjoy being one of the elite clubs. Because one day maybe you will not be here. You will be out of the Champions League at the group stage or the last 16. Qualifying for the Champions League is difficult. People who believe you have to do that are wrong, that is a bad, bad message. Staying in the Champions League is a huge success, enormous. People say ‘no’ but you have to do a lot of good things to get there.” Guardiola said there is no reason for him or his players to worry about their 0-0 draw with Crystal Palace in their last outing. “Dropping points against Palace can happen. People believe – I don’t know why – that because we’re Manchester City we have to be 10 points clear of Liverpool. I don’t buy it. I know how difficult it is. How we behaved against Palace and how we will behave against Southampton, that’s what counts. “We don’t have to find explanations for something for which there is no explanation. One day a player puts the ball in the top corner from 20 yards, another day he misses the goal from five metres. Why? Because it’s football. Don’t find explanations for that.” Guardiola does, however, have an explanation for why Southampton have managed to frustrate his team twice this season, drawing 0-0 at the Etihad in September and 1-1 at St Mary’s in January. “Because they are good,” he said. “They are one of the intense teams, the rhythm they play with, their quality, their manager, their players.” That manager, Ralph Hasenhüttl, would pay to watch Sunday’s opponents and is looking forward to taking them on. Regardless of the result, he expects to learn something. “You take massive things out of his games,” the Austrian said of Guardiola. “When you can imagine about a challenge for a manager, this is the biggest one definitely. “Hopefully we see a really good Cup game and I am sure we will because it is two teams that want to play football, two teams that want to create chances, that are looking for an intense way of playing football. “They are so fantastic to watch – if I was a football fan, I would go there for sure.”",Sport/Football,Pep Guardiola tells Treble-chasing Manchester City to enjoy the pressure,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/19/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-southampton-fa-cup
3/20/2022,"Thomas Tuchel said he was impressed by his Chelsea players’ discipline and focus as, refusing to be distracted by the club’s impending sale, they swept Middlesbrough aside to reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup. “My players have not surprised me but they have impressed me,” said Tuchel following the 2-0 win which came 24 hours after the deadline passed for prospective buyers to submit bids to replace the sanctioned Roman Abramovich. “The trust and team spirit was impressive. That is the culture at our club. “No matter what we do and how much we worry we cannot change the situation so we have to find a certain way of accepting the situation and accepting what we can influence.” The German seemed more concerned about the more junior employees at Stamford Bridge than himself and his squad. “I’m absolutely OK,” he said. “I feel very privileged, but there are 700 or 800 people working at Chelsea and they are very worried about their position so it is my responsibility to show the right spirit and positivity in a situation we did not cause and cannot change. The players have huge talent but with it comes huge responsibility and they are doing it for the people at Chelsea.” Tuchel professed to lack inside knowledge on the progress of the sale. “I don’t know anything about the offers,” he said. “How many serious offers there are or who they are from.” The Chelsea Supporters’ Trust earlier confirmed discussions had been held with prospective new owners as it continues to push for greater fan involvement in Chelsea’s future. The trust has set out a number of expectations of any new owner, including a “golden share”, which would essentially give supporters the right to exercise a veto over certain important decisions. In a statement it said: “The CST has played an important role over these difficult weeks. We have held positive discussions with a number of prospective bidders.” The British property investor Nick Candy, leading a £2bn bid alongside the South Korean companies Hana Financial Group and C&P Sports Limited, has pledged to advocate for a golden share if his offer is successful, while the former British Airways chairman Sir Martin Broughton – leading a rival bid with Sebastian Coe – has also promised to increase the involvement of fans. Broughton told BBC Radio 4’s Today: “[Fans] can come and get all the benefits of ownership and veto rights for free, and we’re open to discounts and investments. We’d be interested [in selling shares at a discount] if that’s what the fans want.” Besides the bids led by Candy and Broughton, other offers are understood to have been made by the financial firm Aethel Partners, by the Ricketts family – owners of the US baseball team the Chicago Cubs – and by the Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss, who has linked up with the LA Dodgers co-owner Todd Boehly, the British businessman Jonathan Goldstein and the Conservative peer Daniel Finkelstein. The bidders now face a wait to learn if their bids will be progressed. Chelsea and Raine Group, the US bank handling the sale process, are expected to make a shortlist before naming a preferred bid, which will then require government approval. That process will involve proving the source of funds and where the sale proceeds go. The Turkish businessman Muhsin Bayrak, meanwhile, who had expressed interest, said that his company had not filed a bid to Raine owing to a misunderstanding with his lawyers over the auction procedure. “I am very upset,” he told Reuters.",Sport/Football,Thomas Tuchel lauds ‘trust and team spirit’ after Chelsea win at Boro,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/19/thomas-tuchel-lauds-trust-and-team-spirit-after-chelsea-win-at-boro
