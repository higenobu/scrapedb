3/23/2022,"Independent candidate Zoe Daniel has won the Goldstein sign stoush, with the Victorian supreme court ruling her supporters have not displayed her signs prematurely. On Wednesday Justice John Dixon declared that displaying the signs for a period of less than three months does not contravene Bayside City Council rules despite the fact the election has not been called. He restrained the council from taking action against those displaying election signs unless they remain up for more than three months or more than 14 days after the federal election. In February Liberal MP Tim Wilson wrote to local party members urging them to dob in allegedly unlawful Daniel campaign signs. The Bayside City Council first sided with Daniel then backflipped on its earlier ruling. It claimed that, because the House of Representatives election is not technically due until 3 September, signs put up before 3 June are unlawful – until the election is called. Daniel’s campaign director, Keith Badger, brought a case in the Victorian supreme court arguing the council had interpreted the law incorrectly, contradicted its earlier advice to Daniel volunteers, and its interpretation was contrary to the implied freedom of political communication. Dixon found that the election for the commonwealth House of Representatives “is an event” for the purposes of the rules “regardless of whether a writ” for the election had been issued. Dixon found the time limit for displaying signs – three months, or 14 days after an event – applied even if the exact date of the event was unclear. Scott Morrison has said the election will be held by May, making the theoretical possibility of a split half-Senate election with a House election to follow before September unlikely. Dixon found it was unnecessary to answer whether the council’s interpretation breached the implied freedom of communication. He suggested he was inclined to order Bayside to pay Badger’s costs, but invited submissions on that question. Daniel is backed by the Voices for Goldstein community group and Climate 200, which has raised millions to support independents running on a platform of greater integrity in politics and more action to combat climate change. In February Wilson told Guardian Australia: “Council has advised us that if we erect signs we will be in breach of the law and get fined, so we have complied and not erected signs.” Wilson defended his warnings about fines, arguing it was “other candidates” encouraging their supporters to erect signs putting them at risk.",News/Australia news,Independent Zoe Daniel wins court battle over election campaign signs,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/23/independent-zoe-daniel-wins-court-battle-over-election-campaign-signs
3/23/2022,"Ten years ago, at the age of 21, Sashi Kumari was admitted to hospital and told her kidneys were failing. She was diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), which requires four-hour dialysis twice every week and ultimately a kidney transplant. “I was very scared in the early stages of my diagnosis,” she said. “I thought about my family, my daughter and the financial burden.” In the decade since, Kumari, who lives in Nadi in the west of Fiji’s main island, has spent thousands of hours in treatment and tens of thousands of dollars paying for it. She now faces the burden of raising more than FJ$40,000 (US$19,000) for a kidney transplant overseas, a prohibitively expensive cost in a country where GDP per capita is less than US$5,000. “Right now, there’s no timeframe on when I’d go to India because I still have some more funds to raise for this,” Kumari said. Kidney specialists in the country suggest that more than 190,000 Fijians – roughly 20% of the population – were likely to be at risk of developing some form of kidney disease. Each year, at least 840 people are diagnosed with ESKD in Fiji and roughly 550 people die from it, with 40% dying within six months of their diagnosis. A huge factor in this mortality rate is the difficulties people face in accessing treatment. Kidney transplants are not possible in Fiji, and so people who require them, and most with ESKD eventually will, have to travel abroad, often to India, for the procedure, paying tens of thousands of dollars for travel, the surgery, accommodation and other expenses. Unless people are very wealthy, fundraising is one of the only options available to them. A search of popular crowdfunding platforms throws up dozens of pages of Fijians desperately seeking funding for a trip to receive a kidney transplant, or even just the funds to pay for life-saving dialysis. Salaseini Wainiveikoso, 25, from the province of Tailevu, is one of them. She needs a kidney transplant and is looking to travel to India to get one, but needs at least FJ$60,000 (US$28,500) to cover the costs. “I found out that my kidney function was at 3%,” said Wainiveikoso, who was diagnosed in 2018. “The first thing I could think of was that I was going to die. I was scared for my life. I didn’t know anything at all about kidney failure until I knew that I had kidney failure.” The cost of her thrice-weekly dialysis sessions has already stretched her family past their financial limit and forced them to look to GoFundMe for help. “I was paying $200 a session, so you can imagine how much has been spent on dialysis alone in three years,” she said. “The financial cost is definitely stressful, even depressing at times. I dread going for treatments but at the same time I need it.” The financial pressure eased a little when Wainiveikoso started receiving a new government subsidy in November. Last July, the Fijian government announced the allocation of FJ$1.5m (US$703,000) to subsidise kidney dialysis treatment to the tune of FJ$150 (US$70) per session. At private facilities, the gap fee is about FJ$50 a session, whereas at government facilities patients do not pay anything. But even with the subsidy, access to treatment is limited by lack of resources, says local nephrologist, Dr Amrish Krishnan, one of just three registered nephrologists in the country, with limited dialysis spots and staff to administer treatment. To help remedy this, in December, he opened the Kidney Hub speciality hospital in Nadi. For Krishnan the desire to start a kidney hospital came from the despair he felt as a young doctor when dialysis was even harder to access than it is now. “For many years I had seen patients suffering from kidney failure because they were not able to access treatment. When I returned to Fiji after completing my master’s training in New Zealand in 2015, I had broken the news of kidney failure to the parents of a 14-year-old patient,” he said. “Not having the means to provide dialysis, I had no resources and that just crushed me. I would cry with them, often privately. I just couldn’t accept it.” While the centre increases the number of beds available for patients, treatment at the private hospital is still too expensive for some. Krishnan said this was because of the high costs, adding that the hospital helped patients organise fundraising drives to get enough for a kidney transplant abroad. Dr James Fong, the permanent secretary of the ministry of health, said the Fijian government also supported people to fundraise for treatment by providing medical reports to assist patients in getting official permits to raise funds from the public. Fong said the ministry also focused heavily on the prevention of ESKD, as the overwhelming majority of cases of kidney disease and ESKD in Fiji were a complication of non-communicable diseases like diabetes and hypertension. Wainiveikoso agrees that prevention is key. “My advice through this journey is for people not to take anything for granted. Appreciate what you have and eat right. I used to skip meals and eat junk food. Don’t do that,” she said. “I think staying positive is very important. You don’t really appreciate what you have until it’s gone or gets taken away from you.”",News/World news,Fundraise or die: how Fijians are crowdfunding lifesaving kidney treatment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/fundraise-or-die-how-fijians-are-crowdfunding-lifesaving-kidney-treatment
