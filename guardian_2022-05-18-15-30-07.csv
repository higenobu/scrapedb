5/18/2022,"UK inflation soared to 9% in April – its highest level for more than 40 years – as the rising cost of gas and electricity pushed household energy bills to record levels. The escalating cost of food and transport also contributed to the rising cost of living, deepening the crisis affecting millions of low and middle-income families. The latest data from the consumer prices index shows a marked increase from March, when the rate was 7%, and February, when it was 6.2%. It will fuel demands for the chancellor to step up help for the most vulnerable with a new package of support. Rishi Sunak has indicated he may offer further measures to boost the incomes of those on the lowest pay, although it is understood the cabinet is split over how to fund the billions of pounds that campaigners say are needed in extra subsidies or welfare payments, with some favouring a windfall tax on oil and gas companies. Businesses in industries affected by an acute shortage of workers have complained that higher wages have also become an important factor in pushing up prices. Labour market figures released on Tuesday showed that average total wages increased by 7% in March, pushed up by bonus payments to staff and consultants working in the finance, IT, construction and professional services sectors. However, income growth has not been evenly distributed. The average pay rise without bonuses was only 4.2%, hitting millions of workers with a fifth consecutive month of falling real wages. A steep fall in the value of the pound on foreign exchange markets has also increased the cost of imports. Sterling has slumped since last month, from more than $1.30 to $1.24 after hitting $1.22 last week.

5/18/2022,"The probable demise of abortion as a federal right in the US will be a “catastrophe” for women in low and middle-income countries, with an emboldened anti-choice movement likely to raise renewed pressure on hard-won gains, doctors and activists have warned. The leak this month of the US supreme court’s draft majority opinion, which argued that the 1973 ruling effectively legalising abortion had been “egregiously wrong from the start”, stunned and enraged many in America. But those shock waves did not stop at the borders of the US, as pro-choice figures around the world – many in countries with restrictive abortion laws and high levels of social stigma around reproductive rights – warned that Justice Samuel Alito’s words would “send a really clear message” of inspiration to anti-choice groups. “I’m sure the pro-life or anti-choice movement in [Uganda] must be hoping and praying that the Roe v Wade legislation be overturned. I’m sure if that succeeds, it will be the biggest achievement the anti-choice movement [has] registered. I’m sure they will use it significantly to counter the work and the gains we thought we had registered,” said Kenneth Buyinza, a Kampala-based doctor. Abortion in Uganda is legal in certain circumstances but highly restricted and dogged by stigma and misinformation. A ministry of health report in 2010 attributed about 8% of the country’s maternal deaths to unsafe abortion. It is far from the only country in sub-Saharan Africa to see a strong link between stubbornly high levels of maternal mortality and unsafe abortions carried out by unlicensed practitioners, often in unsanitary conditions and without the proper equipment. In such countries, the potential for the US move to encourage anti-choice politicians, judges and activists and further hold back abortion rights could not be more worrying. “If Roe v Wade is reversed it would be a victory for anti-choice groups who finance the opposition in Africa and a catastrophe for us. It could influence policymakers and mean that in Africa we will keep seeing women dying. Whatever we have gained could be lost,” said Abebe Shibru, Ethiopia country director for MSI Reproductive Choices. Another region where Alito’s words have caused alarm is Central America, where three countries have total bans on abortion: El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua. In another, Guatemala, lawmakers recently increased prison sentences for women found to have had an abortion, legal only if the mother’s life is at risk. Eugenia López Uribe, regional director for the International Planned Parenthood Federation, warned the US move would inspire anti-choice policymakers in countries such as Guatemala. “They can see that if they change the laws and they go against women’s rights, they can do it without any consequence,” she said. “The sign they are giving now is that women’s rights can be on the table for negotiations. So this is very worrisome.” Sarah Shaw, head of advocacy at MSI, said the potential for legislative backsliding was clear. “A lot of the countries in which we work that have less restrictive abortion laws are probably a little bit ahead of where the country is socially. So they are very, very fragile. So it’s not going to take much to undermine them, overturn them,” she said. In recent years US funding has been essential to the anti-choice movement globally, and Shaw said she feared the overturning of Roe would prompt a surge in the flow of money. In countries where corruption is rife and political systems are vulnerable to “dark money” lobbying, the impact could be sizeable. The other major concern was that in countries heavily dependent on US aid for public health programmes the move could have a “chilling effect” on African governments’ commitment to abortion provision and other reproductive rights, making them “think twice about what they spend money on”, said Shaw. “If there’s a chilling on prioritisation and funding for services that are already massively deprioritised and massively underfunded it’s going to be catastrophic,” she added. Buyinza, who also works at the Uganda family planning consortium, said he worried the move could affect “fundraising and resource allocations to maternal and child health interventions”. He added that in Uganda – perhaps as in the US – anti-choice forces would be unlikely to stop at abortion, broadening their attacks on other areas such as LGBT+ rights. “[By] taking this kind of action, [the US] is actually holding the flag very high now for countries that are still struggling with human rights issues, like, for instance, Uganda, but many other countries. There is no doubt that having this legislation overturned is going to have a significant bearing, [and] most likely it is going to be negative,” he said. In his draft opinion laying out why Roe should fall, Alito concluded that the right to abortion was “not deeply rooted in the nation’s history and traditions”. Such reasoning was deeply problematic, warned Buyinza. “Someone might be looking at abortion rights in isolation, but … there are so many things that are not … rooted in Ugandan and African ‘traditions and history’. And that goes beyond just abortion rights,” he added.",News/Global development,US supreme court abortion reversal would be global ‘catastrophe’ for women ,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/may/18/us-supreme-court-abortion-reversal-would-be-global-catastrophe-for-women
5/18/2022,"The image of a forlorn Ben Whishaw standing in front of a vending machine in the recent TV adaptation of Adam Kay’s memoir, This Is Going To Hurt, did indeed hurt. For many medics, the show seemed less like a drama than a documentary, not least in its grim depiction of how we eat. Many times I’ve been that doctor flagging at 3am and toying with the quandary of whether a Twix or a Twirl should see me through to the end of my shift. I am an NHS anaesthetist and a self-taught baker who inadvertently took their hobby pro. After my appearance on The Great British Bake Off in 2015, I became a baking columnist for the Guardian but remained a doctor; professionally, you could say I lived something of a double life. The time I spent writing sweet recipes came with a certain amount of guilt. In a country facing soaring levels of type 2 diabetes and obesity, should I be churning out recipes that served to encourage the problem? The moral conflict had added depth, given my day job in the NHS. A large number of the patients I meet every day suffer from so-called “lifestyle diseases” related to diet and lack of exercise. So, you might wonder, surely I – of all people – should know better? There is an important and humbling lesson here: the wide gap that exists between knowing what to do and actually doing it. Doctors might be well informed when it comes to public health, but we’re just as fallible as everyone else when it comes to putting it into practice. And sugar is a highly emotive substance. Long before I’d ever written a recipe or thumbed through a medical textbook, it was an everyday pleasure and featured in some of my happiest moments. Baking cookies with my big sister; warm gulab jamun, bathed in golden sugar syrup, which we ate at Hindu festivals; handfuls of sweet popcorn in the cinema. But a simple desire for sugar can easily tip into reliance, like eating from a ward vending machine at 3am, or revising for my anaesthetics exams accompanied by a packet of Haribo. “Treats” can quickly become the norm. We all know that indulging every sugar craving and self-medicating with sweets at times of stress isn’t sustainable, but few will get to see the consequences of those behaviours in the way that those of us who work in healthcare do. I regularly meet patients whose lives have been devastated by complications of diabetes, obesity and heart disease. The costs for those patients, both personally and to the NHS, are spiralling. According to a Diabetes UK report about 10% of the NHS budget is spent solely on diabetes care, 80% of which is used to treat complications such as kidney failure, heart attacks and strokes. And with rates of obesity rising, that slice of the budget is predicted to rise to a staggering 17%. So when meeting these patients, a niggling thought surfaces: if I, with nearly 20 years’ experience of studying and working in healthcare, struggle to control my sugar intake, how can we expect that of patients? Over the past year I’ve been trying to cultivate a new relationship with sugar. Part of that has involved cutting down – using nutrition trackers such as My Fitness Pal to set targets and monitor what I eat throughout the day. Whereas before, I’doften rely on canteen food and snacks, now I’ll plan my meals, mostly around pulses – beans, lentils and chickpeas – to keep them both delicious and filling. I’ll also keep fresh fruit with me during the day in case I need an energy boost. The greater task, though, has been about reprogramming my attitudes to sugar. Going cold turkey was never an option; I take too much joy in sugar to ever do entirely without the likes of tarte tatin. But I’ve realised that having a pudding most evenings is a habit that I can no longer afford. I now try to live a more measured life during the week but save the weekends for baking: cherry pies, apple crumbles, cheesecakes. I make sure that I keep them small enough that my boyfriend and I can finish them between us (having a cheesecake that serves 12 in the kitchen would be hard to resist come Monday). I’m often asked if I have any tricks for cutting sugar: perhaps some wondrous calorie-free substitute that provides all the joy of sugar without any of the ills. Even if such a thing did exist, I don’t think it would help me. It’s the craving rather than the calories that I’m trying to control. That reflexive urge to reach for sugar as comfort. Identifying the situations that lead to stress sugar binges and doing what I can to mitigate them has helped not only to limit how much sugar I consume, but also to lose weight and improve my mental health. I’m not expecting it to be an easy path. Untangling decades of habits never is. But making a few small changes has helped me to live a healthier life and to find a balance between my medical and food careers, which have sometimes felt at odds with one another. I can’t say that I’ll never find myself in front of an NHS vending machine again at 3am, but I certainly do it much less than I did.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Have your cake and eat it: how to cut down on sugar,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/18/how-to-cut-down-on-sugar-tamal-ray-sweet-tooth
5/18/2022,"For Kathryn Mahan and her husband, Jamie, the front steps of their home in the northern New Mexico village of Las Dispensas were a family touchstone. The couple built the house themselves in 2015 and fashioned the steps out of concrete blocks. Every year they photographed their daughter, Rayyah, on them - as Rayyah grew, the steps stayed the same. The largest wildfire in New Mexico history has suddenly changed all that. The family evacuated on 11 April as a rapidly growing blaze on the nearby mountain of Hermit Peak roared toward their home, driven by winds gusting up to 70 miles per hour. Three days later they returned to find the house and all their possessions had been reduced to ash. The only thing that remained were the concrete steps. Rayyah sat on the blackened blocks to pose for a photo as her parents documented the devastation. The Mahans are one of many families who have lost everything in the huge blaze, now raging for more than a month. The Hermits Peak fire started on 6 April when a controlled burn conducted by the US Forest Service leapt its boundaries. It eventually merged with another wildfire called Calf Canyon, creating a mega blaze that has been largely unstoppable. The Calf Canyon/Hermits Peak fire has since ballooned to nearly 300,000 acres, as of Tuesday, making it the largest to ever hit the state. And while there have been no fatalities, thousands of people have been displaced for weeks as firefighters struggle to get the blaze under control. These evacuees are depending on local shelters that serve the largely rural area north-east of Santa Fe and south of Taos where the blaze has left a trail of destruction. Mahan is an ecologist who monitors forest health and was well aware of the threat of wildfire when she and her husband chose to build next to the Santa Fe national forest in the foothills of the scenic Sangre de Cristo mountains. The region is in a ponderosa pine ecosystem, like much of the upland south-west, and is especially vulnerable to wildfire in what has become the worst drought in 1,200 years. The family took precautions to reduce the danger, such as building up defensible space around the house. But their fortifications were no match for a convergence of extreme weather conditions, including hurricane-force winds and an exceptionally dry winter that left forests and grasslands parched. Many scientists believe these wind-driven spring wildfires are yet another unanticipated consequence of climate change in the American south-west. “We are using every trick in the book to fight this thing, but the constant wind we have been experiencing day and night is unprecedented,” says Andy Lyon, a spokesperson for the south-west area incident management team. Lyon notes the fire experienced explosive growth the week of 9 May, when there was a 95-hour period of non-stop red flag conditions (the highest alert level from the National Weather Service for wildfire danger), including 50-60mph winds. And while the winds have died down somewhat over the past few days, record high temperatures predicted for this week will continue to challenge firefighting efforts. The fire remains only 26% contained, as of Tuesday. “There are so many things going against us,” says Lyon. The fire is wreaking destruction on a culturally unique part of the south-west that was once the remote northern fringe of the Spanish empire, in the 17th century. Descendants of those Spanish colonizers continue to live on family homesteads that have been passed down for generations. The mostly unincorporated, centuries-old communities are nestled in stream-cut valleys and mountain foothills surrounded by national forest. Many residents are older, have lived their entire lives in the region, and take pride in their culture of self-sufficiency and connection to the land. Lyon says it has been hard to convince many of them to leave their homes amid the fire threat. In Las Vegas, a town of 13,000 and the largest in the region, displaced residents have been gathering at a shelter in an old middle school. The shelter was established by the Red Cross after the first evacuations in early April. Now led by an army of local volunteers, it provides breakfast, lunch and dinner to 100-200 people a day. On a hot, windy morning last week, the air was hazy with smoke and stray black embers occasionally fell from the sky. The middle school resembled a fast-food drive-through as vehicles waited in line to reach the front entrance. Pickup trucks arrived with pallets of water and toilet paper that were promptly unloaded by national guard troops. Evacuees pulled up in cars with belongings piled to the ceiling and pets in crates. They were looking for dog food, open campgrounds and information on when they could get access to their homes. Inside, the non-profit World Central Kitchen served meals cooked by local restaurants. The gym was filled with pallets of food and cots were set up in the corner. Toys, strollers and clothes lined a wall. T-Mobile was handing out phones with 30 days of free service, and the Federal Emergency Management Association was set up in a classroom to help people fill out disaster relief forms. Ruben Garcia, 85, has been living at a hotel in Las Vegas, New Mexico, since he was evacuated from his home more than a month ago. He is from the village of Rociada, 27 miles north-west of Las Vegas, and lives on 100 acres that have been in his family for multiple generations. Garcia’s house was spared by the fire but barns and farm equipment were destroyed. Rociada remains under mandatory evacuation while crews continue to put out wind-whipped spot fires. “I have had a rough time lately,” Garcia said as he ate lunch with his younger brother Leo at the shelter. Soon after being evacuated, Garcia fell and broke his ribs, compounding existing health conditions. His wife died last year. “Rociada is the most beautiful place in the world,” Garcia said, longing to get back to his familiar surroundings. “It is in the mountains and full of water.” Garcia’s son Michael, who lives in Denver, says going to the shelter for a hot meal and conversation with fellow evacuees is currently the one bright spot in his father’s life. “He and Leo are there every day,” says Michael. “They like to visit with people they know who are also displaced.” While approximately 20 displaced people sleep at the shelter every night, it is also a lifeline to hundreds more who, like Garcia, come for hot meals, supplies and other essential services. An older man walked up to the shelter entrance with a scrap of paper that contained three hand written phone numbers. He had just been evacuated from the community of Chacon and did not have a cellphone or a place to go. “Can you call my friend Larry?” he asked Janna Lopez, a resident who runs the shelter along with a team of local volunteers. Lopez tried the numbers but none were in service. “Sir, don’t worry,” Lopez said. “You should go inside and get a hot meal. We will take care of you.” Then she repeated her favorite Spanish saying, “A barriga llena, corazón contento”: full belly, happy heart. Lopez and about 50 other shelter volunteers have been working 12 hours a day every day for more than a month. Many are evacuees themselves and some, like Andrew Vigil, have lost everything in the fire. Vigil said he and his wife had worked non-stop for three years to earn enough money to buy one acre of land in the village of Teirra Monte. Vigil built a small cabin on the property and they also had a 24ft Winnebago. It was all destroyed in late April. Like most victims of the fire, they did not have insurance, meaning they’ll have to bear the full cost if they choose to rebuild. “When I went back to see the place, my gut was torn out of me,” said Vigil as his eyes filled with tears. Not long after evacuating, Vigil came to the Las Vegas shelter for lunch. Since then, he has been volunteering at the shelter every day for 10-12 hours. “It helps me to be here,” he said last week as he manned the front entrance to greet arriving evacuees. “I’m used to doing stuff and I want to go forward. I don’t want to go backward because there is nothing left for me to go back to.” It will be hard, if not impossible, for many longtime residents in this rural part of New Mexico to recover from the destruction. San Miguel and Mora counties, where most of the fire is located, have poverty levels of 20%. There is the financial barrier of trying to rebuild without the support of insurance as well as the environmental hazard of an increasingly severe fire season. “A spring fire season adds a whole new level of complexity to the problems caused by climate change in the south-west,” says Andrew Sanchez Meador, executive director of the Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona University. “Up until the last decade, wind-driven fire events in ponderosa pine forests were unprecedented.” Meador says one of the most important preventive measures is to reduce the fuel that a fire can consume. The ponderosa pine forests in northern Arizona and northern New Mexico are like tightly packed tinder boxes after a century of fire suppression, and the institute has long championed mechanical thinning and prescribed burns to get rid of excess fuel and reduce fire danger. But with record windy and dry conditions, the timing for conducting prescribed burns on national forest lands located near residential communities is becoming increasingly tricky. Officials with the Santa Fe national forest have apologized for choosing the wrong day for their burn that inadvertently started the Hermits Peak fire. While Kathryn Mahan is grieving the loss of her home, she takes the environmental hazards in stride. “For people now living in the rural west, the risk of wildfire will never go away,” she says. “It is like living in tornado country. Eventually a fire will come to your town.” Mahan and her husband did not have insurance but they have decided to rebuild. The concrete steps will once again be part of a house. Their connection to the community is more powerful than the threat of wildfire. “Everybody is taking care of everybody here,” she says. “This is where we belong.” ",News/US news,‘Nothing to go back to’: the way of life lost to New Mexico’s historic fire,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/18/new-mexico-wildfire-hermits-peak-calf-canyon
5/18/2022,"Older TikTok users are using the online platform, regarded as the virtual playground of teenagers, to defy ageist stereotypes of elderly people as technophobic and frail. Research has found increasing numbers of accounts belonging to users aged 60 and older with millions of followers. Using the platform to showcase their energy and vibrancy, these TikTok elders are rewriting expectations around how older people should behave both on and off social media. “These TikTok elders have become successful content creators in a powerful counter-cultural phenomenon in which older persons actually contest the stereotypes of old age by embracing or even celebrating their aged status,” said Dr Reuben Ng, the author of the paper Not Too Old for TikTok: How Older Adults are Reframing Ageing, and an assistant professor at Yale University. Interestingly, said Ng, most TikTok elders are women who “fiercely resist common stereotypes of older women as passive, mild-mannered and weak, instead opting to present themselves as fierce or even foul-mouthed,” he said. The immense reach that these older TikTok users have means they have the potential to transform negative age stereotypes that proliferate on social media. “There is considerable evidence that ageist stereotypes preponderate among the young on social media,” said Ng. These prejudices reached an all-time high during the Covid pandemic, during which the deadly virus was labelled a “Boomer remover”. “The strength of anti-age prejudices means the participation of older adults in social media is vital in ensuring that such ageist ideas are not left unchallenged,” said Ng, whose paper is to be published in the Gerontologist journal. The paper looked at 1,382 videos posted by TikTok users who were aged 60 or older and had between 100,000 and 5.3 million followers. In total, their videos, all of which explicitly discussed their age, had been viewed more than 3.5bn times. Ng found that 71% of these videos – including those from accounts such as grandadjoe1933, who has 5.3 million followers, and dolly_broadway, who has 2.4 million followers – were used to defy age stereotypes. A recurring motif was the “glamma”, a portmanteau combining “glamorous” and “grandma”, with videos including those of a 70-year-old woman joyfully parading around the streets in a midriff-bearing top. Almost one in five of the videos analysed made light of age-related vulnerabilities, and one in 10 called out ageism among both younger people and their own contemporaries. Other videos positioned older users as superior to younger people. “I may be 86 but I can still drink more than you lightweights” says one clip. “I may be 86 but I can still twerk better than you,” says another, showing an octogenarian leaping up from a fall down the stairs with a twerk. Analysis by the Pew Research Centre has found a remarkable uptake of technology by older Americans during recent years: in 2000, 14% of people aged 65-plus were internet users; in 2019, it was 73%. Only half of adults owned smartphones in 2014, 81% of those aged 60 to 69 have them today. Emma Twyning, the director of communications at the Centre for Ageing Better said: “We need to see much more diverse portrayals if we are to truly shift attitudes and cast off negative perceptions of growing older. Social media is the perfect platform to do this and to call out ageism more generally.” Stuart Lewis, the chief executive of Rest Less, said TikTok was the ideal platform for midlife influencers to take to the stage and defy ageist stereotypes. “Creators are encouraged to be original, raw and unedited – making it the ideal soapbox on which to stand if you want a space to debunk stereotypes and be your uncensored self,” he said. Prof Fiona Gillison, from the Healthy Later Living Network at the University of Bath, who is leading work on challenging stereotypes about ageing, said the study was important. But she added: “There is a balance to be struck in challenging stereotypes about ageing while also accepting that it is OK to want different things from younger people as we grow older, and accepting that our interests and abilities may change.” Ultimately, she said, people need to “take the stigma out of needing adjustments as we age while also challenging assumptions that can accompany these. For example that having a hearing aid somehow implies that we are ‘fragile’ or ‘infirm’ in other ways.” @grandadjoe1933 The 88-year-old Staffordshire man is TikTok’s wealthiest “granfluencer”, his videos apparently earning him about £134,000 a year. Grandad Joe has won 5.4 million followers and 156.7 million likes for videos including one of him giggling after his youngest granddaughter gives his grown-up daughter “attitude just like she gave me [when she was younger]”. @grandma_droniak 92-year-old Grandmother Droniak went viral, reaching 4.2 million followers, after laying down rules for her funeral including “Cry, but not too much,” “Bertha isn’t invited” and “Get drunk afterwards”. @grandmaann2 Grandmaann2 lures viewers to her account with the strapline “I’m old so follow before I die”. Two million people couldn’t resist, and to date they have given her lip-syncs and comedy skits 63.5m likes. @its_j_dog Jenny Krupa, 87, has won 2 million followers and 93m likes since a 2019 video accidentally posted by her grandson, Skylar Krupa, titled “Perks of being old” reached 1,000 views in about 15 minutes. @dolly_broadway The latest video for her 1 million followers shows 89-year-old Dolores Paolino dressing up in a Marilyn Monroe-type dress and telling Kim Kardashian she looks better in it than her.

5/18/2022,"Energy bills have gone through the roof, but that hasn’t curtailed the British government’s enthusiasm for gaslighting. Rather than take any responsibility for the cost of living crisis (or, God forbid, try to solve it), Tory politicians seem to be in competition to see who can dole out the most patronising advice. The latest example of Conservative condescension comes via Rachel Maclean, the safeguarding minister. Maclean told Sky news on Monday that anyone struggling with the cost of living crisis should consider working more hours or think about getting a better-paying job. Thanks, Rachel! Never considered that myself. Now that you mention it, though, I don’t know why everyone doesn’t just become a CEO or an investment banker. It is brilliant ideas such as this that get you a salary of £104,000 in 2020/21 and allow you to claim £218,000 in expenses on top of it, as Maclean did last year. Maclean isn’t the only Tory MP offering helpful life hacks. Lee Anderson claimed last week that food poverty isn’t actually a problem – the problem is the silly poor people: “They can’t cook a meal from scratch. They cannot budget.” Anderson also claimed that you can make a nice, nutritious meal for 30p. Uh, maybe 30 years ago. Conservatives across the Atlantic, I should note, are equally condescending and out of touch. One classic came from Fox News’s Laura Ingraham. Earlier this year, she argued passionately against the forgiveness of student loan debt by saying her mum worked as a waitress until she was 73 to help pay off college loans. “Loan forgiveness [is] just another insult to those who play by the rules,” she said. Sound like pretty terrible rules to me. Still, rule-abiders take note: inflation is nothing to worry about as long as you work more hours, get a better-paid job, cook 30p recipes and get your mother to waitress until she is well into her 70s.

5/18/2022,"The golden sands south from Cádiz form part of the Costa de la Luz and run to the southernmost tip of continental Europe at Tarifa. This is one of the least-visited stretches of Andalucían coast, but are a meeting place of cultures and continents: Africa with Europe; the Atlantic with the Mediterranean. From Tarifa, the hazy blue silhouette of Jebel Musa mountain in Morocco is visible – 14km away over the strait of Gibralta. Visit in spring and autumn to see skies filled with griffon vultures, eagles and storks on migration paths to Africa. Combine ancient history with a day at the beach at Playa de Bolonia, an hour’s drive south of Cádiz. Here lie the enigmatic ruins of a Roman port city, Baelo Claudia, where a statue of Emperor Trajan faces the sea framed by columns, now holding up only sky. A short walk uphill is La Peña Sacra de Ranchiles, an open-air altar carved in a prominent rock, possibly by the Turdetani, pre-Roman tribes. Wander from here to gaze up at Cueva del Moro, a cave facing out to Africa, with engravings 20,000 years old. Head to the nearby beach at Valdevaqueros for views of sweeping dunes and hundreds of kite surfers; beaches at Los Caños de Meca and El Palmar have become a surfers’ mecca. Enjoy surf, sand and a cerveza followed by a heaped plate of pescaíto frito, crispy fried fish, with Cádiz Experiences, which organises surfing and gastronomy experiences in the area. At the end of the day, bed down in a luxurious yurt at Finca Suerte Tierra (from €56 a night for two) just outside Tarifa, or, when it reopens in autumn, stargaze from a safari tent at Jabalina Tiendas outside Cádiz. The wooded hills of the Valle del Genal, 20km inland from the Costa del Sol, are a world away from the busier resorts. Hairpin bends and tight switchbacks echo the wily ways of its notorious 19th-century bandits, and lead to villages largely unchanged since their day. The Genal valley is home to some of the most picturesque pueblos blancos, or “white villages”, such as Atajate, Benarrabá, Algatocín. Head to Genalguacil in the first two weeks of August, when its streets are filled with contemporary artworks from its biennale (Pueblomuseo.es), or to the village of Gaucín, for its ancient castle with immense views over the Serranía de Ronda and the Genal valley. Great swathes of rich wilderness contrast with all the golf courses along the coast. You can hike up to Castaño Santo, an 800-year-old chestnut tree deeply rooted in the Costa del Sol’s history and reddish rock, whose gnarly girth saw the 16th-century Morisco rebellion under Catholic rule. The hike is 13km and starts behind La Quinta Golf and Country Club in Marbella (GPS ref: 36.5259, -4.9926). There is also idyllic wild swimming in the Genal, with hot springs at Baños de la Hedionda, a 15-minute drive from Estepona, hidden in overgrown ruins of Roman baths. Nearby, a deep lake, Lago de las Tortugas, offers an unexpected oasis. For a longer hike, the 700km Gran Senda de Málaga route encircles the entire province of Málaga. Take a stage of this footpath from the village of Benarrabá to Genalguacil to find a 3km detour along the River Genal (signposted left as you cross the river). It leads to La Venta de San Juan, (+34 952 152 055), a rustic restaurant close to several river pools: the chorizo and morcilla (Andalucían-style black pudding) are homemade. Casa Rural Ahora is a rustic guesthouse offering slow food, acres of wild gardens, and a spa with mud baths and whirlpool bath. Doubles from €278 for two nights full-board. South from Seville, you plunge into a different rhythm of life. To the east, endless, sunburned fields and olive groves give way to dusty, orange plains around the ancient towns of Osuna and Carmona. Miles of dead-straight Roman roads pass cortijos, farmhouses with faded grandeur peeling in the sun, storks nesting in bell towers, and palm trees. In a moment the scenery can shift – a fork in the road will lead you up into the Sierra Sur de Sevilla or down to a hidden watery oasis. Myrtle, rosemary and rockrose hide watchtowers and castles that formed part of La Banda Morisca (the Moorish Strip), a 13th-century frontier between the Muslim kingdom of Granada and Christian Seville. You can hike up and wander into one of these ruined castles, Castillo de Cote, signposted from the town of Montellano. Hike or bike along the Vía Verde de la Sierra, a 36km cycle route, which starts in the beautiful pueblo blanco of Olvera and follows an old train line to the town of Puerto Serrano. It winds by ancient dolmens, gorges and the gigantic limestone crag of Peña de Zaframagón. It’s home to a colony of griffon vultures, so pack some binoculars to watch them wheeling overhead. An hour’s drive south of Seville is the embalse (reservoir) of Torre del Aguila. The evening light catches the stone of its eponymous watchtower, reflected in the lake below. In this evocative place, it’s easy to see how folk tales have sprung up from the eroded landscape. They say it was at Gruta del Pontón, a hidden grotto about an hour from Torre del Aguila, that the famous bandit El Tempranillo negotiated his pardon with Ferdinand VII. At Mesón el Chaparrete (+34 625 03 79 92), a rural restaurant deep in the Sierra Sur de Sevilla, crusty loaves are still baked in old wood-fired ovens typical of the region. Camping el Peñón (camping from €4.90pp; bungalow €75 a night for two, €142 for six) sits beneath El Peñón de Algámitas, Seville’s highest peak, where great fingers of rock reach up 1,130 metres. About 20km inland from Almería, the eroded gullies and sun-scorched earth of the Tabernas desert begin. Its dusty canyons, cacti and ramblas ( dry riverbeds), provide the backdrop to numerous spaghetti westerns, most famously Sergio Leone’s masterpieces, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and A Fistful of Dollars. From the parking at the Oasys MiniHollywood theme park, the circular 9km Sendero del Desierto leads through desert gullies, passing abandoned cave houses and tunnels carved into rock gorges. A 20-minute drive north of the Tabernas desert are the foothills of the lesser-visited Sierra de los Filabres. From the village of Senés a signed footpath, the Sendero Hisn Xenex, leads 2km up to the lost ruins of a medieval Islamic citadel. The peaceful hills of the Alpujarra Almeriense, in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, are a 40-minute drive from Tabernas. A beautiful place to watch a sunset is the hilltop Ermita de los Desamparados, a chapel a short walk uphill from the hamlet of Almócita. One of the area’s best-kept secrets is El Paraje del Chef (doubles €340 full-board), with roaring fires, mouthwatering dishes, local wines and cosy cabins. Mossy walls wind along the lanes and valleys of Huelva province, across a landscape dotted with twisted cork oaks and mighty holm oaks. Bordered by Portugal’s Alentejo region to the west and by Extremadura to the north, this area sits between some of the oldest borders in Europe, with nothing to mark them but rivers and ruins. It’s famous for its black pigs, from which Spain’s highest quality jamón is produced, and it’s on the menu at many an onubense bar. Smuggling was, for centuries, a way of life for the townsfolk on each side of the border. Old contraband routes run along the Chanza River, dividing Spain and Portugal. Start at Molino de la Laguna, just outside the village of Paymogo, by the ruins of the old flour mills and follow the footpath upstream for 2km to pass rope bridges, olive groves and numerous places where you can swim across the border. An hour’s drive east takes you into the Sierra de Aracena, whose placenames – Alájar, Zufre and Almonaster – echo their Arabic past. At Almonaster a 10th-century mosque sits proudly above a tangle of white, jasmine-perfumed streets. In the village of Zufre in late August, there are horse races up the ancient, cobbled streets, cheered on from crowded balconies. The nearby village of Santa Ana la Real is a haven for hikers, with paths signposted for stargazing, geology, or forest book-swaps hidden in trees. Stay in a cosy mill house along the River Alájar at Molino Rio Alája, which has six stone cottages in peaceful surroundings (from €145 in El Aguila, sleeping two adults and two children. There’s birding, gastronomy and cycling here, too.

5/18/2022,"This is an intergenerational family drama, inspired by Greek myth, with a radical revisionism at its core. The ancient royals are replaced by working-class characters in Nottinghamshire and the play stretches across more than half a century in the lives of the Webster brood, whose trajectories we follow from 1965 to 2019. Beth Steel’s large canvas reflects brawny ambition and magnificent fearlessness as the dead walk alongside the living and the surreal interrupts the real. It is a kitchen-sink drama that incorporates state-of-the-nation politics, and the generational damage within family life is shown largely through its women. Directed by Blanche McIntyre, the play emanates a retro sitcom vibe at the start but detours into Dennis Potter territory, with hallucinatory scenes, seductive and dreamlike, often with song. Constance, played with grit and charisma by Anne-Marie Duff, is the fiercest of matriarchs – a toxic force in the family and the most magnetic character on stage. A thwarted singer who finds herself in the wrong marriage to placid Alistair (Stuart McQuarrie), she displays selfishness and cruelty but keeps hold of our compassion, too. Duff does Constance justice, singing exquisitely, quoting Bette Davis with a swagger or slink, and talking with a yearning ache of what could have been if she had been sent to the local grammar. A woman with a great reservoir of anger, she reflects on the grinding job of being mother and wife: “I didn’t want to clean this house. I wanted to smash it.” The others seem shrunken in comparison to Constance. Kelly Gough, who plays her quietly sacrificial daughter, Agnes, puts in a strong performance. Carol MacReady, as Constance’s mother, Edith, comes into her own in one quietly pained monologue but struggles with the Nottinghamshire accent and the character is a generic elderly figure in an armchair. Politically, the play has an almost uncanny resonance to contemporary world politics, from Roe v Wade in its plot line on abortion to the “toilet birth” scandal at Sports Direct (which is never named). Steel seems intent on taking risks and they can pay off with an astonishing power, such as when Alistair rises out of his body bag to have the father-son reckoning with Jack (Michael Grady-Hall) that they never had in real life. In one hair-raising moment, Constance’s hospital bed is shaken by the ghost of her youngest child Laura (Emma Shipp, a constant haunting in the play). In its main, gripping storyline of mothers, daughters and working-class womanhood, its horror and guilt carry echoes of Toni Morrison’s Beloved. Every scene with Constance at its centre brings a gale force of emotion. Other episodes are less convincing, like Aneurin Bevan’s visit to Alistair in his garden to talk politics. A puckish neighbour (Beatie Edney), laying out bodies and reflecting on our relationship to mortality, becomes a fabulous twist on the Greek chorus but it is confusing when this character doubles up to address the audience in the same style as the neighbour but now a loan shark. The play travels though such a large span of time that some characters feel skimpy such as Helen (Emily Lloyd-Saini), a Tory who marries Jack and creates fissures within this staunchly Labour-voting family, but whose presence is not divisive enough. While the script is strong, its realisation is bumpy, with uneven pacing and some scenes that are a little too short to hold potency. Actors double up down the ages to good effect, and there is further doubling on stage as characters from the past feature in parallel with their elder counterparts. This adds to the play’s haunting effects but the set begins to look squashed and it seems as if the drama is pushing at the sides of the stage to come into life more fully. Anna Fleischle’s set is flexible nonetheless, switching between different dimensions of time and reality. Despite its inconsistencies, The House of Shades contains nuggets of greatness. An enormous endeavour, it shows Steel is one of our most audacious playwrights.

5/18/2022,"I am a first-year student paramedic, having to self-fund my studies because this is my second degree course. Last December, I was told I had been granted £6,166 from the NHS Learning Support Fund and received the first term’s payment of £1,300. I have since received an email from NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA) saying that it has reassessed my application and that it has now been rejected. It is are now demanding that I repay the £1,300, which I can’t afford to do.NS, Farnham, Surrey You highlight what is, to my mind, a scandal. Paramedic students, unlike almost all other healthcare undergraduates, have been shut out of government funding, including student loans and NHS grants, if they are studying the subject as a second degree. This means that a graduate who wants to retrain as a nurse, dentist or midwife will receive financial support, but if they choose to become a paramedic they must find £27,750 in tuition fees and their living costs. The reason, according to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), is because paramedic science was only granted degree status in 2018 and therefore missed out when, in 2017, funding reforms allowed other healthcare courses to qualify for student loans. Since it became compulsory last September for new paramedics to hold a BSc degree, that effectively bars all but the most affluent of mature students from the profession. The NHS Learning Support Fund was introduced to help healthcare students through the lengthy unpaid placements they must do as part of training. However, the grant, which amounts to at least £5,000 a year, is only available to those receiving a student loan, and since pre-registered paramedic students don’t qualify for a loan, they miss out on the grant as well. Many paramedic students only discover that they are ineligible after they start their course, because the exemption is not made clear on most relevant government and NHS websites. I reported on this anomaly in March. You say you had previously begun a photography degree but abandoned it for personal reasons. Since then you have worked in hospitality on a modest income before deciding to retrain as a paramedic. The grant was a decisive factor, since the part-time job you juggle along with your studies and your placements only covers your rent. Unfortunately, the fact that a previous degree disqualifies you from a loan, and therefore from the support fund, was not picked up when you applied for the latter. All I’ve been able to do is to persuade NHSBSA to consider an affordable repayment plan for the money you have already been paid if you contact it. “We understand the confusion and frustration this situation may cause,” it said. “We undertake regular quality checks to review accounts and they will highlight any errors. This helps inform our ongoing training and improvement work to reduce any future errors.” The DHSC said that it was keeping funding arrangements under review but must balance the need to support students with value for money for tax payers.

5/18/2022,"Good morning. What does it mean to be mainstream? A day after the Guardian’s exclusive on the Prevent anti-radicalisation programme, that question’s been on my mind a lot. The story revealed a leak from the review being conducted by William Shawcross into the programme, which is supposed to be a way to flag vulnerable people at risk of radicalisation. Shawcross believes Prevent is treating “mainstream, rightwing-leaning commentary” as far-right, while Islamist propaganda is being ignored. That conclusion is uncomfortably timed, emerging shortly after the horrifying news of the attack in Buffalo, New York inspired by “great replacement” ideas that have made their way into US mass media – and while circumstances in the UK are very different, it’s highly contested by those who know the field best. But it may not be surprising coming from Shawcross, whose appointment was controversial from the start thanks to his previously expressed views on the “terrifying problems” linked to “quickly growing Islamic populations”. For today’s newsletter, assistant editor Nimo Omer and I spoke to radicalisation experts about their objections to Shawcross’s account of Prevent – and why his view of what counts as mainstream might need closer attention. That’s after the headlines. Conservatives | An unnamed Tory MP has been arrested on suspicion of serious sexual offences, including rape. Some of the offences, which took place between 2002 and 2009, are believed to have taken place in parliament. Economy | Tory MPs called on Rishi Sunak to make cuts to VAT and raise benefits amid dire economic predictions on the cost of living crisis. New data due out on Wednesday is expected to show inflation topping 9%. Brexit | The European Commission raised the prospect of a trade war with the UK if Liz Truss presses ahead with a plan to rewrite the Northern Ireland protocol. Truss set out a bill to make key changes but said she was open to talks. Extremism | The self-confessed white supremacist gunman accused of killing 10 people – most of them Black – in Buffalo, New York, was plotting the attack months in advance, online posts revealed. Japan | A man mistakenly sent ¥46.3m (£287,000/US$358,000) in Covid-19 relief funds gambled away the entire amount on his phone within a fortnight. The money was intended for 463 low-income households in the town of Abu. For most of its 19-year history, worries about Islamophobia have not been enough to fundamentally reform how Prevent works. If anything, it has got tougher: since 2015, education, social services and medical staff have been obliged to report anyone they view as ‘at risk’ of extremism. British Muslims may not have been shocked that once the claim was of a serious problem with how far-right extremism is defined rather than Islamism, the government has ordered a wholesale review. The extracts leaked to the Guardian from a draft of William Shawcross’ report, currently undergoing final checks before publication, will do little to assuage those doubts. According to Shawcross (pictured above), Prevent has mistakenly shifted focus away from Islamist extremism. He hoists red flags over the programme’s treatment of “mildly controversial” right-wing commentary while “[ignoring] Islamist narratives”. Julia Ebner, a research fellow at counter-extremism organisation the Institute for Strategic Dialogue and author of The Rage: The Vicious Circle of Islamist and Far-Right Extremism, takes another view. “The unprecedentedly high referral numbers on the far-right are not the result of a biased definition,” she said. “They reflect bigger trends that we’ve seen in our research consistently in the last few years.” Here are some of the key objections to what we know of Shawcross’ review so far: Radical tropes have entered the mainstream Perhaps the most arresting line from the draft of William Shawcross’ review is that Prevent has a “double standard when dealing with extreme rightwing [views] and Islamism”. In particular, he says Prevent’s definitions of far-right is “so broad it has included mildly controversial or provocative forms of mainstream, rightwing-leaning commentary that have no meaningful connection to terrorism or radicalisation”. The problem with that argument is that it ignores the uncomfortable reality that versions of far-right tropes have repeatedly slipped into the mainstream media in recent years. “There has definitely been a very strong trend of mainstreaming conspiracy myths,” said Ebner. “And sometimes media platforms give a platform to these extreme ideas without even realising where they first gained traction.” The most notorious case of that is the way the “great replacement” theory – the idea of white people being ‘replaced’ by people of colour, through immigration or interracial marriage, for example – has been refashioned and used by the Republican party and commentators like Fox News’ Tucker Carlson in the US. Yet that mainstreaming isn’t a solely American phenomenon – “that’s happening in the UK as well,” Ebner said. There are many examples, but Ebner points to the “breaking point” poster unveiled by Nigel Farage during the Brexit campaign, or Spectator and UnHerd columnist Douglas Murray, who has argued that Europe is “committing suicide” because the “native population” is being outgrown by Muslims. One problem, says Ebner, is that “far-right extremism is seen as coming from within ‘our’ own culture, and so it’s a more painful discussion to have. Whereas jihadism is something that can always be painted as coming from the outside.” The breadth of radical ideologies may be being underestimated While the leak of Shawcross’ draft report appears to suggest that the scale of radical right adherence is overplayed, Ebner argues that the opposite may be the case. “There is a problem of definitions,” she said. “There are many conspiracy theories which spread anti-minority ideas and violence which overlap extensively with the far right but are not the same thing – you see it in antivax communities, or QAnon.” Sympathy with misogynist violence is not included in the framework at all, she added. “There’s a whole universe of different ideological elements which are really hard to tag within Prevent.” Terror threats and Prevent statistics tell different stories As Vikram Dodd wrote on Monday, the nature of terrorist plots under investigation by MI5 has changed drastically in the last 15 years. Where once Islamist plots were viewed as by far the dominant threat, of the 32 assessed as aiming to cause mass casualties in the UK since 2017, 18 were Islamist related, while 12 were associated with the extreme right. In March, the head of Counter Terrorism Policing UK, Matt Jukes, said that three of the four advanced plots disrupted by police in 2021 involved right-wing extremists. But he also said that 80% of 800 live counter-terrorism investigations in the UK were linked to Islamist extremism – a figure that has been used to argue that the growth in Prevent referrals relating to right-wing radicalism is misplaced. But that argument relies on a fundamental misrepresentation of what Prevent is supposed to be for: not as a report card on the level of immediate terror threats, but a way to redirect those who might be vulnerable to radicalisation, who are typically younger and by definition not yet active. Today, the influence of the far right on younger people “has been a significant problem in the UK, and I would say compared to other countries it’s really been quite shocking,” Ebner said. It’s hardly surprising if the – undoubtedly real – threat of Islamist extremism is less visible among young people in the Prevent statistics: adherents are much less focused on proselytising than they once were. “What we see on the Islamist extremist side is there is more of a violent core that has remained active since the downfall of Isis,” Ebner said. “But the wider appeal of violence-inciting narratives is much stronger on the far right.” Viewing this as a problem with Prevent is a bit like seeing Manchester United’s youth development as inadequate because they haven’t identified Cristiano Ronaldo as a hot prospect. Dr Rob Faure Walker, the author of The Emergence of ‘Extremism’ who has his own experience of Prevent from his years as a teacher, points out another reason that the headline figures may obscure the big picture. He told Nimo: “If you look at overall right wing referrals compared to referrals of Muslims – Muslims are a small percentage of the UK population. Let’s say that generally far-right referrals are coming from the white population – Muslims are still massively over-represented within Prevent.” Some view Prevent as counterproductive anyway To Faure Walker, Prevent has a fundamental flaw. He remembers that during his time as a teacher, he was able to hold conversations with Muslim children who said they wanted to travel to Syria and white children who espoused racist views alike. After the Prevent duty to report came in in 2015, “regardless of how critical I am of [the programme], it would have been my legal duty to report those children to the police.” The conversations stopped. Ebner still thinks Prevent can be effective in some circumstances – but warns that the leak of the Shawcross review hints at an approach which could make things much worse. “It almost seems like we would return to the starting point where we were a decade ago, where we are downplaying the threat of far-right extremism,” she said. “I think that could be really detrimental, not just to UK public safety, but to our democratic future.” Frances Ryan unpacks comments from rightwing MPs that suggest the cost of living crisis is, in part, down to personal failures. “It is in the Conservatives’ interests … to propagate the idea that hardship is a result of an individual’s bad decisions,” writes Ryan, “rather than government policies.” Nimo After Jake Daniels became the first current UK male footballer to reveal he is gay since 1990, Thomas Hitzlsperger – who did the same after he retired in 2014 – reflects on the importance of the moment. “I will never regret coming out,” he says. “And Jake won’t either.” Archie The world recoiled at the killing of Palestinian-American Al-Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Aqleh. Guardian columnist Arwa Mahdawi writes about exactly what Abu Aqleh’s death means not only to her as a diaspora Palestinian herself, but to Palestine as a whole. Nimo 3D movies started as a 50s gimmick, returned a decade ago, and are making a comeback once again. That’s the theory, anyway: Stuart Heritage is entertainingly unconvinced. Archie I loved Zoe Williams’ interview with Margaret Beckett, Britain’s longest-serving female MP. It’s easy to think no other political moment is as bad as the one you’re currently in, but Beckett gives us some much-needed perspective as she reflects on her 58-year career. Nimo A man more familiar with a penalty box than a witness box took the stand yesterday, with Wayne Rooney watched on by his one-time England team mate Jamie Vardy, who accompanied his wife Rebekah to court for the first time. “Awkward” was the word of the day, as the two couples sat awkwardly together separated only by a barrister, and then Wayne revealed the “awkward” chat he was asked to have with Jamie about Rebekah’s behaviour at the 2016 World Cup. “I remember the conversation I had with Jamie. It was a bit awkward for me to have to speak with a teammate regarding his wife,” Rooney testified. “I sat down with Jamie Vardy and he had a coffee. It was such an awkward moment.” If he thought that was awkward, one wonders what England’s record goalscorer must think of the past fortnight … “Me sitting in this courtroom is the first time I’m hearing almost everything on this case,” Wayne Rooney said. “This week is really the first time I’ve had any understanding of what happened.” Football | Liverpool took the Premier League title race to the final day by beating Southampton 2-1 away from home. Jürgen Klopp’s team still need Manchester City to slip up if they are to win the league. Football | Arsenal and England midfielder Jordan Nobbs will miss the women’s Euro 22 tournament with a knee injury after being omitted from the provisional squad. Steph Houghton and Fran Kirby were named in Sarina Wiegman’s selection. Cricket | The chief executive of the England and Wales cricket board is to step down next month, the Guardian has learned. After an often controversial reign, his interim replacement is managing director of women’s cricket Clare Connor. The Guardian’s print edition leads today with “Sunak faces Tory clamour to act now on cost of living”. The Daily Mail’s splash is “Police arrest Tory MP over rape and sex offences” which the Telegraph has as “Tory MP held on suspicion of rape”, while in the Mirror it’s “New Commons scandal”, “Tory MP Rape Arrest”. The Metro says “Tory MP is arrested for rape”. The top story in the Financial Times is “Musk discussed Twitter deal with board before disclosing his stake”. The i has “Sunak plots 1p income tax cut this year” while the Times’ angle is ““Sunak plans heating bill discounts and tax cuts”. “So that’s why the Bank of England is helpless” – the Express says Andrew Bailey’s staff work four days a week from home. “Wazzatha” – the Sun’s coverage of the Vardy-Rooney court case continues.
