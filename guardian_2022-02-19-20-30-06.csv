2/19/2022,"What do you get when you bring together some of the most revered thinkers, most progressive-minded activists and one of the most celebrated novelists writing today to discuss the immense challenges we face? A debate about the Spice Girls, of course! For the Guardian’s Saturday magazine, Margaret Atwood wanted to gather some of her favourite experts from around the globe, to ask how they see the world we live in – and what they believe is key to creating the future they want to see. The lineup included bestselling author Raj Patel, dubbed the “rock star of social justice writing”; Senator Yvonne Boyer, the first Indigenous person appointed to the Canadian senate from Ontario; Akala, a writer, musician and poet; the excellently named Merlin Sheldrake, an expert on fungi; Kate Fletcher, whose speciality is sustainable fashion; Jessie Housty, a young Indigenous activist with a focus on decolonisation and community; and Yasmeen Hassan of Equality Now, which works to combat gender discrimination. The panel, hand-picked by Atwood, reflects the many disparate subjects the author is passionate about, and she was as keen to hear from them as they were to understand her vision and ideas.  Everyone was in different countries, pretty much no one knew anyone else, and the “round table” was actually on video, so it should have been a disaster, but the conversation flowed. In fact, it nearly was a disaster, because my recorder died five minutes from the end and, as Atwood said, “Everyone was saying such good stuff!” And they were. (Fortunately, my recorder recovered.) We talked about the power of music, the magic of mushrooms, and zombies. But first, the small question of how the world should be …–HADLEY FREEMAN Margaret Atwood My big overarching question is, what do we want the future to look like? Yvonne Boyer Generally, I would like to see a kinder, healthier, fairer future where everybody is on an equal footing. The area I’m focusing on is Indigenous people; I’ve seen some atrocities in my life and I’d like to see them remedied, and people healthy and healing, and living the way their [Indigenous] ancestors taught them to live. We’ve seen so much destruction of the Earth and the people, and we need to start working together to solve these problems. Hadley Freeman Yasmeen, you’ve been taking lots of practical steps towards improving the future. I wondered if you could share some of those, and what further steps you think we need to be taking? Yasmeen Hassan We’ve been very focused on the equality of women and girls. I come from Pakistan, and a lot of people are deceived into thinking we have achieved gender equality, but when I grew up it was very clear to me that the world was not equal. Then I started delving into what that means for the world. I realised that most of our problems – including wars and conflicts, inequality of income and distribution, and the climate crisis, which I think is one of the biggest threats that we face – are rooted in gender inequality. Conflicts happen in societies which are unequal and treat one half of their population – women and girls, but also Indigenous people and racial minorities – differently. That commands conflict. In a nutshell, if our work is successful then we will have a better world. Raj Patel The good news is that there are lots of peasant movements around the world that are taking the kinds of things that Yasmeen is saying very seriously. There are food systems that are agroecological, which means you grow in a way that builds on the synergies in the soil – and we’ll talk about mushrooms later on, I imagine – but also think about equality as a cornerstone of how we’re going to eat better in the future. While governments have been generally rubbish at supporting this kind of agricultural transformation, the international peasant movement La Via Campesina has 200 million members who are doing practical research every day, and are calling for agroecology and gender equality. So what we eat in the future will depend on where you find yourself, but ideally will come through social relations that are post-capitalist and are grounded in gender equality. MA Woo! HF Seeing as Raj mentioned mushrooms – Merlin, are mushrooms the way of the future? Merlin Sheldrake [Laughs] Well, mushrooms are the reproductive structures of fungi, and fungi are a kingdom of life. The history of life is, in large part, the history of fungi. And given that that’s been going on for more than a billion years, far longer than a lot of plant life, I’d wager that the future would also be a story in part of fungi and fungal relationships, and in part fungal relationships with humans. HF I want to discuss how culture improves the present and the future. Akala, I know you work so much with music … Akala I was originally a musician, but a lot of the stuff I’ve done is around education and culture. I wrote a couple of books: a social history of the British empire called Natives: Race and Class in the Ruins of Empire, and a young adult novel called The Dark Lady. So a lot of my work is around getting young people to see how important school is. There can be serious consequences – particularly coming from certain types of backgrounds – of not doing well in school, in terms of future rates of incarceration, limited job prospects, limited economic prospects and even life expectancy. So it’s about trying to make education something that is cool and aspirational and interesting. MA Do you put on shows with kids? A Yeah, we put on shows and do all sorts of outreach projects. I do a lot of talks at youth clubs, prisons. So, a range of things. Arts education is the cornerstone of trying to get people who are struggling back on track in school, or for people who are doing well, to give them that extra boost. MA Sounds like a lot of work. A Yeah, it’s tough, but it’s good. HF Kate, I wonder what you see as the biggest opportunity in terms of improving the future? Kate Fletcher The biggest opportunity for fashion is recognising that the future can’t in any way be aligned to an economic growth logic. We have to recognise that we’re on a finite planet and we have to work within planetary limits. Where the work needs to happen is to try to find new ideas about what fashion can be – beyond just buying more stuff and then styling yourself on Instagram. MA In terms of new materials and fabrics? KF Ultimately it’s a question of culture, not materials and technology. Materials are never going to solve the problems we’re facing. At the moment, the fashion sector is growing at something like 6% each year, and no material, however efficient, however regenerative, however useful for soil health, will ever undo the negative effect of that sort of growth. So what we’re facing is a fashion industry that’s going to radically reduce in scale and become way more localised; and also be much more plural – so have much more diverse representation, drawing upon all of the traditions that we know of in Indigenous groups. Jessie Housty I feel blessed to do a lot of land-based healing and education work with Indigenous youths and families, and I see the biggest threat to the future as being continued disconnection. We have faced generations, since first European contact, of Indigenous peoples being regulated away from our territories, our families being broken, relationships to place and territory and resources being fractured. And to be able to participate in the work of rebuilding those connections, building kinship, a sense of cultural identity that connects people to place, so that they feel inspired to protect it and love it, that feels like such important work. I think connectivity is the antidote to all of the social and environmental problems I see my community and neighbouring communities facing. HF I wondered if each of you could tell me if there was a book, a film, or a moment that woke you up to the problems facing the future? YB The one book that really woke me up was when I became a senator and started reading the Hansards [records of Parliamentary debates], which go back to confederation. And I realised that Jean Chrétien, who was the Indian affairs minister in the 1970s, was denouncing the forced sterilisation of Indigenous women. In the 1970s. And in 2022 we still have women being sterilised? It made me see how appalling the whole history of colonisation has been. And exactly what Jessie is saying, I hope there is hope for the future because we certainly haven’t learned much from the past. HF Jessie, I’d love to hear how you got inspired into your work? JH Through oral storytelling culture. It was a privilege to grow in my community surrounded by elders and generations of knowledge-holders who led me into the work I’m doing. More broadly, if I was going to recommend one thing to lead people into a beautiful, active, revolutionary life, I would tell people to read more poetry. HF Margaret, what was it that woke you up to how you want to change the future? MA I grew up with biologist environmentalist parents at a time when that was considered rather weird – we’re talking about the 40s and 50s. So I understood from a very early age that things are connected, that we are connected to the natural world, things within the natural world are connected to one another. I would be with Jessie – oral storytelling, but of a different kind. More about beetles! HF Raj, you are known as the rock star of social writing, what led you into that? RP I’m an activist around hunger, and I write because it’s something I can do for the movement. Again, it’s certainly about storytelling. Eating meals with people can be incredibly transformative, where you didn’t know that you could eat that, you didn’t know that you could cook things this way. And the sort of conviviality and political transformation that’s possible around the table is something I’ve been lucky enough to experience a few times. And that blows my mind, to be able to be sensual in new ways that feel like they’ve been taken off the table by capitalism and modern colonial relations. To experience food, in community, as a decolonising exercise is something I’m very grateful for. HF Akala, you work with young people. What is it that you recommend to them to awaken their social conscience, to alert them to what they want to do for the future? A There’s a book called How Europe Underdeveloped Africa by Walter Rodney, who was a Guyanese historian. That was quite seminal for me. It’s not necessarily one I recommend to teenagers, just because it’s very dense, but people in their early 20s, certainly. Music was also a big eye-opener for me – I grew up on Public Enemy and things like that. That’s one of the reasons we see music being used to sell so much vacuous celebrity culture – because music is so powerful. It can be driven in either direction. And a lot of the social consciousness that was in hip-hop, in particular, has evaporated. HF So what I’m hearing is you’re not a massive Spice Girls fan? A No, I love the Spice Girls. Don’t get me wrong, I think there is a place for everything! It’s important to have fun and listen to music that does allow escape and fantasy, and explores all these other realms of human possibility. I just think within that there needs to be some music or some art that also challenges us. HF Yasmeen, you work so much with women and girls, are there certain things you recommend to them to see, in terms of thinking about their future? YH The book that really impacted me – and Margaret, shut your ears – was The Handmaid’s Tale. Growing up in Pakistan, I was like, “Ooh, this is our reality, this is how we live.” And then I went to college in the US and studied feminist movements, and saw that everything Margaret had written about was true in some part of the world. That was my wake-up call – if we don’t get this thing right, this is where we are heading, this is where we’ve been and this is where we’re heading again, because in the last five years women’s rights have gone backwards. Another important book for me was Sex and World Peace, by Valerie Hudson, which really does deep-dive studies in linking the level of gender equality in a society with the level of peacefulness of that society. And I really wanted to bring this to the UN security council, because we are working on all these ways to prevent conflicts, but none focus on, “Let’s work on equality of women and more opportunities for women in a society as a way of preventing conflict.” YB I have a question, Yasmeen. Have you delved into matriarchal societies? YH We have. This is something Gloria Steinem, who’s on our board, is very into. We found some in south India, some Native American, and life was much better. This is why I come back to: our economic model’s not the right one, because those societies did not have what is now considered the capitalist model of growth. It was not about maximisation of profit, it was maximisation of happiness and fairness. MA There’s nothing built-in that says, as a species, we have to have hierarchical societies. We have had many different models of societies throughout history and pre-history. It does not have to be dog-eat-dog all the time. There’s a book called The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity, it’s by David Graeber and David Wengrow. I liked it because it suggests that we have many more possibilities to choose from than we have been traditionally told we have. YB I want to mention the Haudenosaunee society. It’s a matriarchal society, and they’re very much alive and well. I also want Jessie to comment, because she will have learned about communities where women were the anchors and made the decisions. JH I come from a matriarchal society, a matrilineal culture, and it is still very functional in my community. In our governance systems, men are permitted to wield a certain amount of political power and authority, but the moral authority rests with women and with matriarchs in the community. I certainly faced my share of barriers growing up, but my gender was never one of them. And that remains a core source of strength for youth in my community. HF Merlin, I wonder if you see the future differently now than you did 10 years ago? MS When I was younger, I tended to imagine the future as some kind of version of the present. But now I think of the future as a cloud of possibility, that is made up of a numberless quantity of past decisions. I reached this view from thinking about plants and fungi. Both plants and fungi grow from the tips of their shoots or cells, and they leave behind them these networks, like bodies, which are, if you like, maps of their past. And so they helped me to think about the present as being this place of choice-making, and the future as this place of opportunity. HF Margaret, who has contributed most to your vision of the future? MA There isn’t one future – as Merlin will tell us. So I try not to say “the future” because we have some choices about the kind of future we will end up in. Unfortunately, the further we go along the road of climate crisis, the fewer choices we have. But we still have some choices, and we really need to start making them. HF Would any of you want to live for ever to see how the future turns out? MA No. We’ve read the books about vampires and zombies, who live for a long time but end up being this heap of wreckage. Reading the myths, you don’t ask for long life unless you also ask for eternal youth. A If I was eternally fit and healthy, then sure. But without that, no. MS It’s a definite no from me. If someone told me I was going to die tomorrow, then my experience would take on a very vibrant quality. And if someone told me that I would never die, then I think the opposite might happen. MA What we would all like is not necessarily living for ever in our bodily forms, which could actually get quite boring, but the ability to pop in from time to time to see how things are coming along. HF Could you each nominate someone you think is contributing to improving the future? YB I think my daughters. My succession plan is for my two daughters to carry on the work I started, because they’re both lawyers and they’re both passionate about the work they’re doing. I’m comforted in that. MA The Greta Thunberg generation. The young people who are interested in these issues and understand these connections, those are the people who are going to carry it on. And we should be giving them help to the best of our ability. JH I work with youth every day, I see their power and resilience, I see them make tremendous change that I never would have thought possible. But rather than singling out any one of them, I really hope that we see the potential in every single one of them to make that kind of change. MA Thank you very much everyone for the informative and thoughtful conversation.

2/19/2022,"When Dr Nadine Burke Harris was first appointed California surgeon general, she set out to address the toxic stress and trauma plaguing the state’s most vulnerable residents. Then the pandemic hit. Suddenly, she found herself having to guide millions through statewide shutdowns, and persuade scared, skeptical Californians to get vaccinated against Covid-19 and wear masks to prevent the virus’ spread.  Burke Harris, who resigned this month, said the pandemic is “probably the greatest collective trauma of our generation,” and she, like all Californians she was sworn to serve – will have a long road ahead processing the last two years. Reflecting on her three years as surgeon general of the most populous US state, Burke Harris warned that “the health consequences of this pandemic will continue, even after the virus itself is contained.” More than 82,000 Californians have died from the virus, and during Burke Harris’ last week the state continued to tally about 200 deaths a day. The state, which was the first to enact stay-at-home orders two years ago, has seen the coronavirus overwhelm hospitals, exacerbate health inequities and disproportionately burden Black and brown Californians. When Burke Harris was named the state’s first-ever surgeon general in January 2019, she stepped into a historic role – one that California governor Gavin Newsom created just for her. Only three other states have surgeon generals. Drawing on her expertise as a pediatrician who specialized in recognizing and treating early childhood trauma, she made it a priority to screen children across the state for signs of extreme stress. By early 2020, her office had just launched an initiative to train health providers across the state to screen for childhood trauma and abuse and respond with appropriate care. When Covid-19 hit, “everyone had to put a lot of things on pause, to respond to the pandemic”, she said. Her office decided they couldn’t delay the training program. “Because we’re desperately going to need it,” she said. So far, more than 20,000 providers have been trained. Guided by Burke Harris and the surgeon general’s office, California also enacted a first-in-the-nation law requiring insurance providers to cover screenings for what pediatric health specialists call “adverse childhood experiences” – including the loss or death of a parent, abuse or neglect – which studies have correlated with a number of chronic health conditions later in life. Two years into the pandemic, an estimated 200,000 children in the US have lost parents or caregivers. Many more have seen loved ones hospitalized with prolonged illness, or crushed by the stresses of navigating a pandemic with inadequate social safety nets. All that distress, Burke Harris said, will be a heavy burden for children to process – and the state will need to continue investing in helping them do so. Burke Harris herself will be working to process the past two years. “Serving in a leading public health role during the pandemic,” she said, “is almost like a deployment.” It required a degree of unwavering focus and dedication. She wasn’t able to look away from its horrors, even for a moment. Not even when her mom ended up in the ICU and Burke Harris was unable to see her due to Covid restrictions. It helped “bring home for me what so many Californians were experiencing, having a loved one in the hospital”, she said. “And sometimes you’re standing outside. And you can’t get in, and you really want to see them – and you don’t know how it’s gonna go.” During her lowest moment, after she heard former president Donald Trump falsely declare an end to the pandemic in the spring of 2020, Burke Harris allowed herself a few minutes to cry in the restroom. “And then I came back to work,” she said. Burke Harris’ last day was 11 February , and she will use the time off to care for herself and family, she said. Stepping into her role will be the office’s chief health officer, Dr Devika Bhushan, who is also a pediatrician with expertise in childhood toxic stress. For Burke Harris, a doctor and public health expert who had dedicated her career to racial inequities in healthcare, seeing the pandemic immediately exacerbate disparities was “heartbreaking”, she said. “To look and see that some Californians are dying at dramatically higher rates than others – you can know about it, and you can study it, but when you see it and the impact on our communities,” she said. “It’s absolutely heartbreaking. And incredibly motivating.” In June 2020, as the US erupted in protest against police brutality, Burke Harris wrote in a Medium post: “I often hear the question ‘what it is about black and brown people that makes us more vulnerable to the virus? That question infuriates me.” Decades of research show that people’s experiences and environments can affect their biology, she continues. “Racist oppression ensures that black and brown children bear a disproportionate burden of dehumanizing and traumatic experiences. Science shows it is sickening them and killing them.” The work of dismantling oppressive systems, and healing the harms they cause is a “continual, ongoing effort”, Burke Harris said. After completing her undergraduate studies at University of California, Berkeley, medical school at University of California, Davis, and earning a master’s of public health from Harvard, Burke Harris founded a children’s health clinic in San Francisco’s Bayview-Hunters Point – a predominantly Black and underserved neighborhood in the city’s southeast corner. Burke Harris had set out to target health disparities in the city, but as she started seeing patients in Bayview she realized many of them needed more than routine physical exams, vaccinations, and prescriptions for inhalers. Many were showing signs of chronic stress, and their bodies were straining under the weight of poverty, societal adversity, and generational trauma. In 2012, she founded the Center for Youth Wellness, a clinic focused on identifying and treating that sort of stress in children. As surgeon general, Burke Harris made it her goal to bring the services the clinic was providing to children all over the state. One of her proudest moments, she said, was seeing Newsom approve a $4bn investment – made in consultation with her office – in behavioral health screenings and treatment for children and young adults. “California is leading the nation in our response to the effect that this pandemic has had on kids,” she said. As surgeon general, Burke Harris co-chaired the state’s Community Vaccine Advisory Committee, which worked to develop an equitable vaccine distribution plan. “One of my proudest moments when we’re looking at the data charting, and we saw the inequities being reduced when it comes to vaccine access,” she said. The disparities haven’t disappeared. Vaccinations among Black and Latino Californians continue to lag. As the governor pushes to lift mask mandates in schools across the state, vaccination rates among Black and Latino children are also lagging – fueling concerns that racial and ethnic inequities in coronavirus infections and deaths will be exacerbated in the coming weeks. “One of the challenges when it comes to addressing inequities is that people think that either you’re going to do a program, and that program should fix it. Or you’re going to do some kind of one-and-done intervention,” she said. “But it requires continual work, continual course correction, continual coordination.”",News/US news,California’s first surgeon general on Covid: ‘Greatest collective trauma’ of a generation,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/19/covid-trauma-california-surgeon-general

2/19/2022,"The next time you have a “what to eat for dinner?” emergency, reach for a jar of shop-bought tom yum paste. It brings a distinct sweet, sour and spicy profile to anything it touches, and I’ve used it to rescue meals for the best part of my adult life. You can buy it in large supermarkets, online or at Asian food stores. Combined with stock, you can easily create a speedy take on Thai tom yum soup, or toss it with roast sweet potatoes for caramelised wedges bursting with heat and umami.  From first chop to first slurp takes a quarter of an hour. It’s flexible, too: swap the protein or veg for whatever you have to hand.

Fill and boil the kettle again. Put the eggs in a saucepan and add cold water and a teaspoon of salt until the eggs are just submerged. Cover with a lid, bring to a boil, then turn down to a rolling simmer and cook for six minutes. Drain, run the eggs under cold water, then peel, cut in half and set aside. Fill another saucepan with 750ml boiling water from the kettle, add three tablespoons of the tom yum paste and stir to dissolve. Taste the broth and add more paste until you achieve your desired flavour intensity (brands differ, so the quantity of paste needed will vary). Bring the liquid to a boil, add the prawns, then immediately turn down the heat and poach gently for 30 seconds, or until pink and just cooked through. Stir in the mushrooms and take off the heat. Drain the noodles and divide them between two bowls. Pour the hot broth, prawns and mushrooms over the noodles and top with the beansprouts and egg halves. Garnish with a handful of coriander and serve immediately.

2/19/2022,"The awkward bare ankles of a shrub or deciduous hedge are not things of beauty, but there they often are. Nature doesn’t leave this spot bare for long, though: all sorts of things make the most of this sparse space. Right now, it is spring bulbs – first snowdrops, then aconites and bluebells, wood anemones, and later perhaps some lily of the valley. I mention these, not just because they are starting to unfurl, but as it is the best time to get hold of them to plant. So, if you have a threadbare hedge base or shrub or garden tree that could do with a ruffle or drift of flowers at its feet, get ordering.  All of these will come “in the green”, meaning that you will put your order in swiftly and the nurseries will lift the bulbs with their green foliage and perhaps a flower or two, wrap them in something damp, pop them in a Jiffy bag and send them to you quickly. Your job is to plant them in haste, as the quicker they get into the soil, the better they will settle in. All these bulbs establish better in the vigour of full growth, rather than as dry autumn bulbs. Bulbs sold “in the green” are available until April or early May. As these are woodlanders, they do best in soil that is rich and a little damp over the summer. The base of your hedge or shrub might be quite the opposite. So the best thing you can do to rectify this is add leaf mould as a mulch. If you don’t have this, add a good layer of peat-free compost before you plant, and mulch around the bulbs with more afterwards. If your ground is hard, then forking it over first will make a difference. You don’t have to turn the soil, as that will damage its structure, but just loosen it. This will make digging holes for the bulbs much easier. For the most naturalistic look you want to plant your bulbs in drifts. Bluebells need to be planted deep, so they can make the most of the damp below over summer – at least 10-20cm if you can get that low. You certainly need to get to the depth that they were lifted from – there will be a distinct pale line in the leaves and this is the minimum depth. Snowdrops need to be planted 5-10cm deep and will do better in a drier spot than bluebells. Wood anemones are almost surface dwellers, but again will need rich, damp soil. Lily of the valley and aconites similarly sit near the top, but aconites will grow anywhere, in pretty much any soil. Lily of the valley need a little more shade. Once the bulbs are in, water well and keep on watering, particularly if we have a dry, hot April. Don’t expect any flowers this year, and next year may be thin too, as the plants concentrate on getting their roots down, but after that your future springs are set.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Now is the season to plant snowdrops, bluebells, wood anemones, aconites and lily of the valley | Alys Fowler",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/19/now-is-the-season-to-plant-bluebells-wood-anemones-and-lily-of-the-valley
2/19/2022,"Fostering guide dogs was part of Gary Lyon’s plan to never get his heart broken again. It backfired spectacularly. It all started when Lyon, a 75-year-old retired plant pathologist, had to put down his pet dog, Zac. “He was a lovely boy,” says Lyon. “But he had all sorts of health problems towards the end, and was off his feet and not happy.”  Zac, a lhasa apso, always had a very responsive tail. When it was up, he was happy; when it was down, he was sad. “We noticed his tail was down all the time,” says Lyon, “and realised the end was nigh. After it was done, my wife Carol and I said we never wanted to go through that again.” It is the first of many times in our phone call that Lyon almost cries. Lyon lives near Guide Dog UK’s dog training centre in Forfar, north of Dundee, where puppies finish their training before being rehomed. “I’d seen people locally with guide dog puppies,” says Lyon, “and thought, ‘That’s a good way to go. That way, I don’t ever have to put another dog down.’” He signed up to be a trainer in 2014. For the first year of their lives, puppies live at Lyon’s home. He teaches them basic commands and more complex skills, such as how to lead people upstairs and how to stop at a curb and wait for the lights to change. “Guide dogs are some of the best-bred dogs,” says Lyon. “If there are any medical or behavioural issues, their parents are taken out of the breeding programme. They’re intelligent, inquisitive, confident.” Most are labradors, golden retrievers or German shepherds – or a mix of these breeds. One of the first dogs Lyon trained was Elvis, a labrador. Lyon taught Elvis how to identify a door. “What you do,” he says, “is say, ‘find door’, go to a door, rattle the handle, then give him a treat.” To test him, he took Elvis to a shopping centre in Dundee. “I said, ‘find door,’ and he took me to the nearest exit. We hadn’t even come in that way. I had no idea how he did it. I think he smelled the fresh air.” When he started working with Elvis, Lyon thought it would be easy to give him back. (Lyon usually gets the puppies when they are seven weeks old, and hands them back to continue their training when they are 14 months.) “When we first got Elvis,” Lyon says, “people said, ‘Won’t it be hard to give him up?’ We said, ‘Oh no, it’s not like putting a dog down.’ I had no idea. I just disintegrated when the dog went.” He chokes up again. The next dog Lyon trained was Murphy, a lab-retriever cross. “He was so cute it was unbelievable,” he says. Murphy went to Sarah Parkinson, who is 55 and lives in Newtongrange, just outside Edinburgh. “I became very depressed when my eyesight deteriorated about five years ago,” says Parkinson. “I had to give up work and felt completely confined to the house. But when I got Murphy life just started getting better. He enabled me to live a full life again. He’s changed my life completely.” Lyon, she says, is a truly remarkable person. “He’s so dedicated,” she says. “He produces such rounded dogs. They’re so loving and caring and well-trained.” Parkinson, Lyon and Carol are now friends: she comes to visit, and brings Murphy with her. Watching Murphy interact with his new owner is a bittersweet joy. Murphy looks up at Sarah with such love, Lyon tells me. He is emotional again. After Murphy, there was Rocky, a German shepherd. “God,” says Lyon, voice cracking. “He was lovely. I bonded with him big time. Floods of tears when he went.” The most recent dog was Forest. “He was the best,” says Lyon. “He was stunning. My wife bonded with him and said, ‘I can’t do it again.’” It’s a bitter irony, I point out, that a plan to avoid the heartbreak of putting down another dog has locked Lyon into a perpetual cycle of loss – only with many animals, not just one. “I am torturing myself,” he agrees. “But it’s worth it.” He says it is a privilege to train the dogs. “I’m doing something useful. You can’t always do something useful in life.” When asked about his treat from Guardian angel, Lyon is resolute: the only thing he wants are some fresh toys for his current charge, Danny, a 13-month-old labrador-retriever cross. “He loves soft toys,” Lyon explains, “but they don’t last long.” Online pet boutique Love My Human provides Danny with a box, which the puppy immediately gets to work on. “He’s shredded one of them already,” says Lyon. “It was a pig. There’s only a tail left now.” They’ve been playing tug-of-war with the remaining toys: it takes all of Lyon’s effort not to fall over. “They’re such strong dogs,” Lyon says. Watching Danny gambol and play with his new toys is a bittersweet experience for Lyon. “I’m not yet dreading him leaving,” he says. “That comes later, when they’re getting ready to go. I just want him to succeed.” Want to nominate someone for Guardian angel?

2/19/2022,"On any given Saturday, Rory would spend several hours glued to a screen flickering with hundreds of football and horse racing bets placed by customers of the Irish bookmaker Paddy Power. One of multiple insiders from firms including Paddy Power Betfair, Ladbrokes and William Hill who spoke on condition of anonymity, Rory was part of an obscure corner of the gambling industry that exists to maximise profits by clamping down on successful punters.  “The volume of customers they had, you could afford to get rid of anyone you thought wasn’t going to be profitable,” he said. Punters know the house usually wins, but most have no idea that bookies sharpen their edge via something called “stake factoring”, the process by which winning customers are dialled down, while losers are allowed to bet more. It works like this: when a customer opens an account, they might be given a stake factor of 1, meaning they can bet 100% of the normal maximum stake, for example £500. “As soon as people start winning or losing, that gets adjusted,” said Cameron, formerly of William Hill. “It starts with 50% and if they keep doing it [beating the bookie], it’ll keep going down. At William Hill it went down to 25% to 10% and eventually down to 1%.” Sometimes, such decisions are determined by other factors. “We’d make judgments based on what job you do, who you’re friends with on Facebook,” said Steve, who works as an odds trader at a well-known betting website. “It’s particularly true of any account with a female name,” he said, explaining this was often someone who had had their stake factor reduced on their own account and was posing as a spouse, sister or friend. A manual, handed out to employees of Paddy Power within the past six years and seen by the Guardian, offers further insight. It advises staff to restrict customers who “look like bad business” and to increase stake factors for “all customers that are regularly hitting their max [maximum bet]”. Those customers with a stake factor above 1 can wager more than 100% of the normal maximum figure. The guide also suggests traits that supposedly indicate someone is likely to be bad business, including “eastern European customers”, apparently based on concerns about locations in which past suspicious betting patterns have been identified. For the bookies, stake factoring is seen as a legitimate way of levelling the pitch against punters who they argue are resorting to unfair methods. One former trader at William Hill explained how the firm would be targeted by “latency cheats”, people who exploit the small delay between events at a match and the bookies’ TV pictures, either by accessing a faster feed or attending the event. “You see a bet come through from a brand-new account on a certain cricketer to score less than 25 runs, and they’ve put on as much as they can. You look up at the TV and he’s out that ball.” There is, too, always the risk of the stablehand or kit man with inside knowledge of a lame horse or a star striker with a tummy bug. Other areas, though, are less clear cut. Some insiders complain of “bonus abusers”: people who milk the offers that companies send out to lure in new gamblers. Much more common are the “arbers” or arbitrage gamblers, who scour gambling websites for obviously wrong odds. By identifying an event where the odds are clearly priced wrongly, arbers can place a conflicting bet with another operator and make a return regardless of the result. The practice can even be automated by using bots to place multiple small wagers, flying under the radar of systems designed to spot the practice. However, some traders fear that bookies have become trigger-happy, targeting not just cheats but canny operators, known in the trade as “warm” or “shrewd” punters, or simply as “bad business”. “It tends to happen now that everyone that beats the price gets put under the ‘arber’ banner, which is unfair,” said Fintan, who has worked at multiple operators including Ladbrokes. “I’d say it’s probably 65%-70% of punters that get factored where it’s definitely the right decision.” One ex-Paddy Power employee showed the Guardian a menu of stake factors that suggest the company was more than happy to restrict people who were simply canny. New customers were set at 1.0, the document said, unprofitable customers at 0.3, and “warm” customers at 0.1. “The people running these businesses are answering to shareholders,” said Connor, who works in the gambling industry. “The guys in the trading room didn’t want to be answering on a Monday morning why they didn’t close an account that was winning.” One gambler, Bernard Henry, shared the results of a demand sent to Coral to see what data it held on him, known as a subject access request. It showed he had won just £38 over four years but had been prevented from placing sports bets after the bookie realised he had beaten their odds 73% of the time. He was still allowed to bet on casino products where the house never loses over time. Henry believes bookmakers shared data about him with other operators, via software that companies are permitted to use which is intended to prevent fraud but might also be used to shut down a smart better. Everyone the Guardian spoke to said accounts were rarely closed completely, for good reason. According to Paddy Power’s manual, “warm” customers are “of use to us as marks”, meaning they are worth monitoring to assess if your prices are wrong. Even arbers, seen as cheats in the industry, would be set at a factor of 0.01. One former employee of Betfair believes this is about satisfying City investors, who see customer numbers as one measurement of success. “If they close all the bad customers, you go from 50,000 active users to 10,000,” he said. The flipside of factoring down winners is that losers have, over the years, been given more leeway to place ever bigger bets. The biggest stake factor Rory recalled a customer being allotted was 40. “He’s allowed to lose 40 times what anyone else was and it was astronomical what he was punting. There was no conscience to it.” In response, Paddy Power said its safer gambling checks would always override stake-factoring decisions. All of the sources who spoke to the Guardian said stake factoring was increasingly automated at the more tech-savvy companies. This, they said, meant there should be fewer arbitrary decisions made by bookies playing it safe. But Brian Chappell, founder of Justice for Punters, said he did not trust the industry to do right by its customers and feared unintended consequences. “Following intrusive, secretive profiling, only losing customers are allowed to choose how much they bet,” he said. “This is facilitating an unsafe and unfair UK sports betting market where unprofitable customers are more likely to consider the black market.” A spokesperson for Paddy Power owner Flutter said stake factoring was “common practice across the industry” but that it did not wish to restrict customers unfairly. They said the practice was “also critical in protecting the integrity of sporting events where we believe a customer placing bets has inside information”.
