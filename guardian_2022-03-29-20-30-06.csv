3/29/2022,"We wish to express our horror at the abuse Child Q faced at the hands of the adults who should have been keeping her safe in school. That she wasn’t is a damning failure of our society. But this isn’t about one child in one school in one area of the country; there is an urgent need to tackle the systemic racism that continues to affect children at every level of our institutions and society. Never again should a child be forced to suffer in this way. Schools must be places where all children are protected. Safeguarding training and relevant guidance for all teachers needs to be reviewed and strengthened, in line with the reviewers’ recommendations. We also believe that all safeguarding training that teachers undertake must include a specific element on racial bias, so teachers are more alert to the traumatic and lifelong negative impact that racism has on children. We urge the Department for Education to act quickly. The Home Office and police leaders also need to take action and review statutory guidance and training around searches to ensure that the safeguarding needs of children are paramount in every situation. Importantly, all bodies should ensure they consult properly with children and young people as they seek to implement these changes – to ensure youth voices are at the heart of relevant decision-making. And we all, as a society, must work together to tackle and challenge systemic racism which allows the horrific treatment of young people like Child Q to take place. We, collectively, promise to do everything we can as charities that support children to put anti-racism at the heart of everything we do. The safety and wellbeing of millions of our children depends on it.Russell Hobby CEO, Teach FirstLouisa McGeehan CEO, Just for Kids LawPeter Wanless CEO, NSPCCGwen Hines CEO, Save the ChildrenNdidi Okezie CEO, UK YouthLouise King Director, Children’s Rights Alliance for EnglandNick Jones Managing director of fundraising, communications and policy, Action for ChildrenLynn Perry CEO, Barnardo’sMark Russell CEO, The Children’s SocietyAnna Feuchtwang CEO, National Children’s BureauJo Hobbs CEO, British Youth CouncilRuth Marvel CEO, The Duke of Edinburgh’s AwardLeigh Middleton CEO, National Youth AgencyKathryn Morley CEO, OnSideTessy Ojo CEO, The Diana AwardAlison Peacock CEO, Chartered College of TeachingKathy Evans CEO, Children England",News/Society,We must all tackle the systemic racism that led to the abuse of Child Q  | Letter,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/29/we-must-all-tackle-the-systemic-racism-that-led-to-the-abuse-of-child-q
3/29/2022,"The saga of lockdown-breaking parties in and around Downing Street has reached a new stage after the Metropolitan police said 20 fixed penalty notices would be issued for breaches of Covid rules. Here is what we know so far: We only know the very basics: for taking part in a gathering in breach of the Covid lockdown rules in place in England at the time of the event. Police are investigating 12 separate events in 2020 and 2021, six of which Boris Johnson is said to have attended. The Met said it would not detail how many fines were issued for each event, as this could identify people involved. No. The police statement said those who were fined would not be named publicly, according to the professional practice guidance for fixed penalty notices (FPNs). Some forces do issue regular lists naming people given FPNs, and the offence committed, but the Met is not among them. Seemingly not yet. The 20 fines are believed to be those seen as most straightforward to issue, with others possibly following later. Johnson has vehemently denied that he breached any rules, and so is unlikely to fall into this first camp. Downing Street has said it will say if Johnson receives an FPN. It started in November last year when the Daily Mirror said Johnson made a speech at a leaving event a year earlier, when England was in the middle of a Covid lockdown, and that a Christmas party took place that December in Downing Street. No 10 insisted that rules were followed at all times, but more and more allegations followed. A week after the first allegations, a video was leaked to ITV showing Downing Street staff joking about an apparent party in December 2020. More than 15 alleged events have been reported, spanning a period from mid-May 2020 to April 2021. Among them were a cheese and wine gathering in the No 10 garden on 15 May 2020, of which the Guardian was sent a photograph; a “bring your own booze” party, also in the garden, five days later; an alleged party in Johnson’s flat in November 2020 on the day Dominic Cummings left his job; and two “boozy” leaving parties taking place in No 10 simultaneously in April 2021, the night before Prince Philip’s funeral. Mainly denial, with the extent and wording of the denials adjusted in line with new facts. Johnson’s first response, after the initial Mirror story, was to say “all guidance was followed completely in No 10”. When the video emerged showing No 10 staff joking about a party, Johnson said he was “sickened” but that he had been “repeatedly assured that the rules were not broken”. When the Guardian’s photograph emerged of the 15 May garden gathering, Johnson said it had been a work gathering. Significant. The political received wisdom appears to be that Johnson will not face intense pressure to resign unless he is fined, and even then possibly not, with the invasion of Ukraine having focused Conservative MPs’ minds elsewhere. But even if the 20 fines are the only ones imposed, they demonstrate mass disregard for rules in and around Downing Street while the rest of the UK was, for the most part, abiding by lockdown. Johnson had repeatedly denied any breaches, meaning he either had no idea what his staff were up to, or did not tell the truth. Neither is a particularly comfortable position to be in.",News/UK news,No 10 lockdown parties: what do police fines mean for Johnson and Tories?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/29/no-10-lockdown-parties-what-do-police-fines-mean-for-boris-johnson-and-tories
3/29/2022,"Locals at mainland Britain’s most remote pub are celebrating a community buyout of their beloved establishment after a year-long struggle to raise funds and secure a sale – and hope to be pulling pints again by Easter. The Old Forge is accessible only by ferry or via a two-day trek through the Knoydart peninsula on the west coast of Scotland. But it is a vital social hub for more than a hundred residents in Inverie, the main settlement. Jubilant residents say the pub will once again become “the place where everything happens” after having secured its future after 14 months of fundraising. After decades of private ownership, more than £320,000 was raised through a community share offer and crowdfunding, as well as funding from the Scottish Land Fund and Community Ownership Fund. It means there is now enough capital to buy the building and carry out essential renovations. “It’s a bit of a cliche, but when you live in such a small community the pub plays a much bigger role than just somewhere to eat and drink,” says Stephanie Harris, secretary of the Old Forge Community Benefit Society, which now owns the pub. “In the past it was where everything happened: birthdays, weddings, when a new baby came home from hospital that was the first place they visited. It was the place where everyone came together.” A consultation to gauge local opinion on seeking a buyout was held last spring, with the response being almost unanimously in favour. The area has a history of successful community ownership, having secured 17,500 acres of the Knoydart estate, which includes Inverie, in 1999 – one of the first community buyouts in Scotland. Under the community ownership model, profits will be reinvested in the business, not shareholders, and will fund wider community projects. The pub’s Belgian owner put it on the market last year, asking for offers over £425,000. There had been reports in recent years of growing friction with Knoydart residents, who raised concerns about its closure during the dark winter months. There were also fears that reduced opening hours, as well as a reduction in staffing, had hampered attempts to attract new people to the area. The pub is also a pivotal part of the area’s tourist trade: located about 30 miles north-west of Ben Nevis, it is on the main sailing route to Skye, the Outer Hebrides and the Small Isles. This attracts yachting enthusiasts as well as hillwalkers and boat-trippers. Harris told the Guardian the community’s plans for the Forge were simple enough. “We want it to feel welcoming, with friendly staff behind the bar and an affordable menu, where families feel comfortable, and we’ll be restarting the music sessions again.” The community is aiming to reopen on a drinks-only basis at Easter weekend while renovations on the kitchen continue, and is in the process of hiring staff. Harris says they “already have a number of local residents lined up, which is great, and means we are achieving one of our goals to provide new local employment”.",News/UK news,Locals secure buyout of mainland Britain’s most remote pub ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/29/locals-secure-buyout-mainland-britain-most-remote-pub-old-forge-inverie
3/29/2022,"UK shoppers are choosing to shop at discount supermarkets in greater numbers as grocery price inflation reaches its highest level in a decade amid a mounting cost of living crisis. Aldi grabbed its biggest share of the grocery market to date and Lidl matched its previous peak as grocery price inflation reached 5.2% in March, the highest level since April 2012, according to the latest figures from the analysts Kantar. Lidl confirmed its spot as the UK’s sixth-largest supermarket chain ahead of the Co-op with 6.4% market share while Aldi reached 8.6%, less than 1% behind the UK’s fourth-largest chain, Morrisons. Kantar said prices were rising fastest for pet food and savoury snacks, such as crisps, but were still falling for some products such as fresh bacon. Food price inflation, fuelled by the rising cost of basic commodities such as wheat and cooking oil as well as energy and packaging, is forcing shoppers to change their habits as price rises filter through to supermarket shelves. With headline consumer price inflation running at 6.2% – the highest level in three decades – families on tight budgets are seeking ways to save on basic necessities. Shoppers are increasingly turning to supermarkets’ own-label goods rather than well-known brands with more than half of spending on such items – 50.6% – up from just under half a year ago. Cooking from scratch, which rose in popularity during the Covid lockdowns, also appears to have remained more prevalent with the volume of flour sold up 28% on March 2019 while dry pasta sales are up 17% on pre-pandemic levels. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: “More and more we’re going to see consumers and retailers take action to manage the growing cost of grocery baskets.” Aldi and Lidl were the only big chains to increase sales in the 12 weeks to 20 March, recovering from a downturn during the first stage of the pandemic when there was more demand for home deliveries and less interest in shopping around. Morrisons and Asda were hit the hardest by changing habits, potentially losing out as their budget-conscious shoppers turned to discounters, while Tesco fared the best of the big chains, but with sales still down 5.2% over the three-month period. Overall spending in supermarkets dropped by 6.3% in the 12 weeks to 20 March compared with the same period a year before, as the return to the office and reopening of cafes, restaurants and bars damped down demand for home cooking. Independent retailers were the biggest losers, with sales down 13.4% as shoppers returned to big stores after shopping locally increased during the lockdowns.",News/Business,UK shoppers head to Aldi and Lidl amid cost of living squeeze,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/29/uk-aldi-lidl-cost-of-living-price-inflation-kantar
