2/7/2022,"Political interference in research grants poses an “existential threat” to universities, the Australian National University vice-chancellor has warned. On Monday Prof Brian Schmidt said he was “dismayed” that the education minister had interfered in the awarding of Australian Research Council grants before Christmas, and took aim at both major parties for backing the power to override independent recommendations.  On Christmas Eve the acting minister, Stuart Robert, revealed that the government had nixed six grants for proposed research relating to climate activism and China, prompting a widespread backlash from academics. In his state of the university address, Schmidt said there had only been “four known occurrences of political interference” in the Australian Research Council grant process – three of which were in the last three years. “As things stand, both major parties agree it is appropriate for the minister to wield this power,” he said. “Political interference has bipartisan support. I see this as an existential threat to Australian universities. “My strong view, a view held by many university leaders, whether they say it out loud or not, is Australia needs an apolitical system to allocate research funding and a review of the Australian Research Council.” Schmidt said political interference “can corrupt knowledge and slow down its creation” argued that academic independence is “one of democracy’s key advantages over other forms of governments”. “[It] allows us to pursue ideas across a broad spectrum of possibilities. We don’t just focus on what is known or thought relevant or acceptable at the time.” Schmidt asked: “What would our society be like when the study of history, politics and literature has to reflect the views of the minister of the day? “Where would we be if we hadn’t been working on climate mitigation strategies for the past 30 years while the merchants of doubt sowed their seeds? “What if we hadn’t invested in understanding the foundational properties of messenger RNA when it seemed just a dalliance with no practical benefits?” A petition with nearly 1,500 signatories, including those of high-profile authors JM Coetzee, Michelle de Kretser, Alexis Wright and Amanda Lohrey, has called for Robert “to reinstate the defunded projects and commit to legislating the complete independence of the ARC from government interference and censorship”.

In the speech Schmidt revealed that the ANU had run a surplus in 2021 due to a “better than expected result” because of one-offs including insurance payments, government research support and investment gains, alongside a “substantial amount” from unfilled positions. He committed to fill the positions, despite acknowledging this would result in deficits in 2022 and 2023. “We are still likely to need to take on debt over the coming years but I remain confident we will not have to make any more cuts,” he said. “We are leaner, but not meaner.”",News/Australia news,"Political interference poses ‘existential threat’ to universities, ANU chief warns",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/07/political-interference-poses-existential-threat-to-universities-anu-chief-warns
2/7/2022,"The Miami Dolphins have appointed San Francisco 49ers offensive coordinator Mike McDaniel as their new head coach. McDaniel will replace Brian Flores, who was fired on 10 January and has since filed a lawsuit that alleges the NFL “is racially segregated and is managed much like a plantation”.  McDaniel, who identifies as multiracial, is now one of only four minority head coaches in the NFL along with the Pittsburgh Steelers’ Mike Tomlin, the Washington Commanders’ Ron Rivera and Robert Saleh of the New York Jets. McDaniel is the first person of color to land a head coaching job in this cycle. We have agreed to terms with Mike McDaniel. Welcome to Miami, Coach! pic.twitter.com/Hk5gIQsc6l The 38-year-old McDaniel did not play football at any significant level and studied history at Yale before interning at the Denver Broncos. He slowly worked his way up the NFL ladder, becoming the 49ers’ offensive coordinator in January 2021. McDaniel is seen as one of a number of innovative young coaches in the NFL, and the 49ers reached the NFC conference game this season, beating the No 1 seed Green Bay Packers along the way. McDaniel helped develop Deebo Samuel into a dual threat as a receiver and rusher, and the player was named an All-Pro this season. “He’s one of the smartest coaches I’ve been around,” said 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan of McDaniel last month. “… He’s been huge to our team and huge for me throughout my entire career.”",Sport/Sport,Miami Dolphins hire 49ers’ Mike McDaniel as new head coach,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/06/miami-dolphins-hire-49ers-mike-mcdaniel-as-new-head-coach
2/7/2022,"The legacy of The Invisible Man is open ended. The 1897 tale by HG Wells is a thrilling read, but its lasting impact is less as a story than a concept. Where the novella gave us an arrogant scientist roaming unseen across the Sussex downs after violent attacks on the locals, subsequent adaptations have repurposed the idea of invisibility for their own ends. In Leigh Whannell’s 2020 screen version, the invisibility of Oliver Jackson-Cohen in the title role becomes a metaphor for his coercive control over Elisabeth Moss as his abused partner. Like many a gas-lighter before him, he does not need to be seen to be obeyed.  For actor-turned-playwright Philip Correia, the vanishing act is an analogy for social invisibility. Played by a brooding Daniel Watson, Simon Griffin is a young Northumberland man heading to a secure unit in Morpeth, thanks to a history of fire-raising. “No one in authority had known anything about Simon Griffin,” says one of his assessors. He has been excluded from school and excluded from society. Behind his illiteracy lurks an awesome intellect, but he is invisible to the world even before turning transparent. His psychiatrist Sara Kemp has the opposite problem. Played by a spirited Kate Louise Okello, she is “too white to be black, too black to be white,” and feels forever visible. She wants Griffin to be seen for what he is but, as the case becomes notorious, finds herself in the spotlight instead. All this is resonant stuff, but rather than drive the action, it mostly sits on top of it. Apart from a vicar who believes the poor are responsible for their own misfortune, we don’t see anyone actively excluding Griffin. Nor does anyone racially discriminate against Kemp. We only have their word for it. It’s not just that Anna Girvan’s production, in which every character is unaccountably bad tempered, is stuck in the psychiatrist’s room when it could be exploring the theatrical possibilities of invisibility. It’s also that, despite the questions of a public inquiry, a TV news reporter and Kemp herself, Griffin and his motives remain elusive – see-through to the last. At Northern Stage, Newcastle, until 19 February, and touring until 26 March.

2/7/2022,"Brick Lane author Monica Ali has said it felt like an “obliteration of the self” when people were confused that she chose to write a novel about what might have happened if Diana, Princess of Wales had not died in a car accident, rather than about “brown people”. The novelist said she became depressed when her 2011 book Untold Story was met with “bafflement”. She told The Big Issue: “I think I was really naive in thinking that I could write about whatever I wanted, like a white male writer can.”  Ali, who is of Bangladeshi and English heritage, gained national attention in 2003 with her debut novel, Brick Lane, which was shortlisted for the Booker prize and detailed the immigrant milieu of east London. Her fourth and most recent novel, Love Marriage, follows a 10-year gap in which Ali said she suffered a “catastrophic” lost of confidence. She told the magazine: “Ten years ago I stopped writing. And then I got depressed. … And the depression made me less able to write and so it became this downward spiral. I lost my confidence.” Ali said writing about “such a wide variety” of subjects following the publication of Brick Lane “confused people”. “The response was bafflement. I remember one critic saying about Untold Story, ‘a curious marriage of author and subject matter’. People would ask ‘Are you trying to get away from something?’ To me the question they really seemed to be asking was ‘Are you trying to get away from brown people? Are you trying to get away from your ethnicity?’” Ali said. “I understand that it confused people but … my mum’s white, my father’s Bengali, I was born in Dhaka but I’ve lived here all my life. So, I felt I was being entirely true to who I am. It’s taken me a lot of therapy to understand that, for me, that reaction felt like a kind of obliteration of the self,” she added. “That sounds like hyperbole, but actually, I’m not exaggerating; this idea that I have to choose to be one thing or the other – it’s existential. I’m not one thing or the other, I’m both. And I’m glad to be both. So, I think that critical reaction made me feel things which went very deep, which led to the loss of confidence and depression and all of that.”",Arts/Books,Monica Ali says reaction to previous novel caused 10 years of depression,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/07/monica-ali-says-reaction-to-previous-novel-caused-10-years-of-depression
2/7/2022,"Theresa May and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall are among figures backing a campaign to encourage survivors of sexual and domestic abuse to come forward for help through the NHS. The campaign, backed by a £20m boost to specialist services, comes on the first day of Sexual Abuse and Sexual Violence Awareness Week.  NHS England (NHSE) said the campaign was intended to highlight the support offered at dozens of sexual assault referral centres (SARCs) in England. The service is also creating two new clinical lead roles for domestic violence and sexual assault. NHSE said the 24-hour centres offered confidential specialist, practical, medical and emotional support to anyone who has been raped, sexually assaulted or abused, no matter when it happened. May, whose government introduced the domestic abuse bill that finally passed into legislation last year, said survivors needed to know “the NHS is there for them”. “Sadly incidents of domestic abuse and sexual assault increased during lockdown and the extra funding for services for victims of abuse and sexual violence is much needed,” the former prime minister said. “Dedicated domestic violence support for the NHS and integrated care systems is particularly welcome as local medical care plays an important role in identifying abuse and supporting victims.” Camilla has highlighted the issue of domestic abuse for a number of years and NHSE said she would visit a centre this week to meet survivors of sexual assault to hear more about their experiences and the care they receive through SARCs. A short video raising awareness of the help offered by specialist centres has been released as part of the campaign, which is supported by organisations and charities including the Survivors Trust, SafeLives and the Male Survivors Partnership, a NHSE said that despite official figures showing that domestic abuse and sexual assault had increased in the pandemic, the number of people receiving help from SARCs halved after the first lockdown compared with 2019. Laura Currer, the chair of the national NHS England sexual abuse and assault services lived experience group, said: “I know from experience how hard it can be to seek help in these situations, but after I was assaulted I will never forget the kind, caring and compassionate staff at SARCs who were there to hold my hand during one of the worst moments of my life. “They explained the whole process to me, and gave me the space and autonomy over my body that my attackers had taken away, and I will be forever grateful. “I urge anyone who needs support, no matter when it took place, to come forward – you are not alone, and the wonderful teams at SARCs are there to help 24/7.”",News/Society,Camilla and May back NHS campaign to help victims and survivors of abuse ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/07/camilla-and-may-back-nhs-campaign-to-help-victims-and-survivors-of-abuse
