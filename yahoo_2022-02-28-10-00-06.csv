2/28/2022,"As everyday Ukrainian people take up arms against Russian invaders in a desperate bid to hang onto their democracy, Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) on Sunday compared their situation to protesting truckers in Canada who didn’t want to get the COVID-19 vaccine. “I pray for Ukraine and I wish them the best. They have a great president right now who has really said clearly, ‘Live free or die.’ He said, ‘I don’t need a ride, give me ammunition. The fight is right here,’” Boebert said in an interview with Fox News personalities Kayleigh McEnany and Pete Hegseth at the Conservative Political Action Conference that aired on the Fox Nation streaming service. “But we also have neighbors to the north who need freedom and need to be liberated and we need that right here at home as well.” The gun-obsessed, extremist lawmaker had been referring to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s refusal of a U.S. offer to be evacuated from Kyiv, as Russian troops continued to press into the capital in an unprovoked attack that has shocked the world. Zelenskyy has vowed to defend the country with its citizens, saying, “We are not putting down arms.” The city’s residents have sheltered in underground bunkers and subway stations and accepted weapons from the government to join the fight in the streets as Russian airstrikes rain down on the capital and other cities. Boebert made the outrageous comments after Hegseth brought up Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and called him an “autocrat” because he quashed anti-vaccine protests that had paralyzed international supply chains for weeks. The demonstrators were against vaccine mandates and an assortment of other measures intended to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Boebert claimed President Joe Biden is “jealous” of the control that “tyrant Trudeau” has, adding that the Ukraine crisis is “all because of weakness in America.” She did not mention the actual cause of the Ukraine crisis, Russia’s authoritarian president, Vladimir Putin. Boebert is notorious for making hateful, bigoted and false statements with potentially dangerous repercussions. On Jan. 6, 2021, shortly before a violent mob of Donald Trump supporters broke into the U.S. Capitol to try and overturn a democratic election, she tweeted, “Today is 1776.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

2/28/2022,"Morgan Stanley Wealth Management CIO Lisa Shalett said the Russia-Ukraine conflict will keep markets in risk-off mode for weeks. She said a rapidly-changing situation often results in a flight out of risk assets, but this isn't a good strategy in the longer run. Russia invaded Ukraine on Thursday in the region's largest military operation since World War 2. Financial markets have been roiled this week after Russia invaded Ukraine following weeks of escalating tensions. Volatility has soared and investors are wondering what this means for their portfolios. Russia assembled vast numbers of troops around Ukraine — as many as 190,000, per US estimates — in the largest military operation in the region since World War II. On Thursday, Putin authorized a full-scale attack on Ukraine. In the hours that followed, explosions pounded cities around Ukraine, many hundreds of miles from the previous conflict zone. Ukrainian officials reported fighting on its borders with Russia, and dozens of casualties. Stock markets plunged, then rallied, then came under renewed pressure, while oil hit $100 a barrel for the first time since late 2014, on the back of concern about the impact to global supply should major crude producer Russia be unable to move exports. Morgan Stanley Wealth Management's chief investment officer Lisa Shalett believes that however the situation develops on the ground in Ukraine, it won't be a matter of markets rapidly returning to business as usual following the initial shock. ""I think it's a big deal. And I think it's a risk off factor in the next few weeks,"" she told Insider in an interview earlier in the week. She said Morgan Stanley continues to be cautious towards markets. ""When there are exogenous crises around the world, whether it's a war, whether it's 911, whether it's a trade war, or whether it's a political scandal, whatever it is, these things tend to make people want to reduce their exposure to the most risky assets,"" Shalett said. Since Putin said early on Thursday he had authorized military action, investors have ditched riskier assets like stocks and crypto and flocked to the safety of gold, government bonds and the dollar. She said this is the typical playbook that gets deployed in this environment is investors selling high beta, high growth stocks, such as technology shares, and buy defensive assets, like gold and bonds. But simply responding to a rapidly-changing set of catalysts isn't a good long-term strategy. ""The situation in Russia-Ukraine is completely fast moving and fluid,"" she said. ""People are de-risking portfolios. But that's not something that you can base a portfolio asset allocation or portfolio construction decision around.""""Anything short of a full-blown war is likely to be short-lived, in the context of long-term investing, which is what our clients tend to do,"" she said. ""And so this is the exact type of thing that we encourage them not to try to trade and not to try and react to, because invariably, you're going to get it wrong,"" she said.
