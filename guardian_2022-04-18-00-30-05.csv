4/18/2022,"Almost half of UK teachers, many of them triple-jabbed, tested positive for Covid in the last term, according to a new survey. Despite government insistence that it is “business as usual” in schools in England, 48% of teachers polled by the NASUWT teachers’ union said they tested positive during the spring term. In addition, nearly 30% said their school had been forced to close or send home either classes or year groups because of an outbreak of Covid. The NASUWT expressed alarm at the continuing high Covid rates in schools and called for more protection and support for teachers, many of whom have had Covid multiple times. More than a quarter (26%) of those who took part in the poll of 4,000 members said they felt under pressure to go to work even when they believed they had Covid-19 symptoms. Meanwhile, just under a third struggled to access free tests. “Regardless of what the prime minister tries to claim, the pandemic is still with us – continuing to disrupt children’s education because of the government’s business as usual approach,” said Dr Patrick Roach, the NASUWT general secretary. Almost one in three (29%) teachers polled said there had been a Covid outbreak declared at their school or college in the past term, but only half (53%) of those who took part in the survey were confident their setting had an outbreak management plan in place. Just over 7% of those who responded to the survey – about 260 NASUWT members – said after having Covid-19, they were asked to return to school prior to the sixth day of absence after a positive test. Three out of five (59%) said they felt generally under pressure to return to school when ill, and 28% said they did not feel that their school or college managed their health and safety well. “Teachers have been left vulnerable and unsupported since Covid-19 mitigations have been removed,” said Roach. “Without access to free tests and additional safety measures, schools will struggle to protect staff and maintain continuity of provision for pupils. “It is vital that appropriate action is taken swiftly to ensure that schools continue to operate safely and that teachers are supported rather than bullied when they are ill.”",News/Education,"Almost half of UK teachers had Covid last term, survey suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/17/almost-half-of-uk-teachers-had-covid-last-term-survey-suggests
4/18/2022,"The former chancellor Philip Hammond could see the value of his stake in the cryptocurrency firm Copper plunge after the company suffered a blow to its hopes of winning approval to operate in the UK, forcing it to explore a move to Switzerland. The Guardian understands that Hammond, recruited by Copper Technologies as a “senior adviser” in 2021, has “growth shares” that could be worth up to 0.5% of the company, implying a notional value of $15m after its most recent fundraising valued it at $3bn. The Conservative peer, who was chancellor between July 2016 and July 2019, has been a vocal advocate of the UK embracing digital assets. Earlier this year he said it was “frankly quite shocking” that Britain was lagging behind other countries in creating a regulatory framework for crypto. Copper is now struggling to negotiate the threadbare regulatory regime for crypto that already exists, putting its fundraising plans – and the value of Hammond’s stake – at risk. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which recently launched a hunt for a head of digital assets, requires crypto firms to apply to be registered, meaning they must prove that they have sufficient anti money-laundering controls in place. The regulator has granted full approval to 34 firms and rejected dozens that could not show that they had met sufficient standards, either because they missed red flags for money laundering or “do not have the controls necessary to raise red flags in the first place”. A smaller group of 12, including Copper, was placed on a list of firms with “temporary registration”, meaning that they were permitted to trade pending the outcome of their application. Despite the FCA granting an extension to the deadline for applications, to the end of March 2022, Copper is one of five that remain on the temporary list. The FCA said firms on that list “may be making representations […] or may have particular winding-down arrangements” and were “aware of what is required of them to conclude their application”. Copper, which says that $50bn in “notional” money flows through its “infrastructure” every month, told the Guardian that its discussions with the FCA were ongoing. However, a well-placed source said that Copper had begun exploring alternatives, including a move to Switzerland. The move would be likely to require more than 500 customers, including family offices, traders and private banks, to open accounts there. Copper said its international expansion required hubs in different countries. It already has an office in Zug, Switzerland. Hammond said earlier this year that crypto firms were increasingly considering relocating to countries such as Switzerland, Monaco and Germany because of a poor regulatory framework in the UK. Any failure of Copper’s UK ambitions could affect its plans to raise $500m from venture capital investors, via a fundraising effort targeting a $3bn valuation. Potential investors Accel and Tiger Global have considered pulling out of the funding process because of the difficulty in winning the FCA’s blessing, the crypto website CoinDesk reported earlier this month. Any disruption could affect the value of Hammond’s holding, understood to be in “growth shares”. Typically, holders of growth shares can cash out if the company is sold, hits a certain valuation or lists on the stock market but can’t receive dividends or vote on company resolutions. While securing approval from the FCA has proved difficult for some crypto firms, the government has taken steps towards creating a welcoming environment for digital assets. Earlier this month, Rishi Sunak – to date one of Hammond’s two successors as chancellor – stated his wish to turn the UK into a “global hub” for crypto. An FCA spokesperson said it was trying to ensure that firms “meet the minimum standards we expect – that those who run these firms are fit and proper and that they have adequate systems to identify and prevent flows of money from crime”. They said: “These are in place so our financial system is not open to abuse by those who want to move and hide money made from violence, drugs, corruption or the exploitation of others. “When we decide a firm does not meet the standard for registration, we are clear with them where they are going wrong. The money-laundering regulations don’t include a provision allowing firms to withdraw their applications. However, in some cases, we may allow a firm to withdraw, stop operating, make the changes necessary following our feedback and reapply. Firms that do not withdraw are issued a formal decision which they are able to appeal, including through the court.” Hammond was approached for comment.",News/Politics,Cryptocurrency firm linked to Philip Hammond still lacks UK approval,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/17/cryptocurrency-firm-linked-to-philip-hammond-still-lacks-uk-approval-copper-technologies
4/18/2022,"An exhibition of erotic art found among the ruins of Pompeii will aim to show inquiring minds that racy scenes were present in homes across all sections of society and public spaces and that the images were not looked on in a scandalous or embarrassing way. About 70 relics, including two medallions decorated with images of satyrs and nymphs that came from a ceremonial chariot found at the site last year, will be on display at Pompeii’s archeological park from 21 April. In addition, visitors will be able to tour the site, guided by an app, to check out homes along the Via del Vesuvio containing sexual frescoes, including one depicting the god of fertility, Priapus, weighing his manhood on a scale that was found in 2018, and another the scene of the figure of Leda being impregnated by the Roman god Jupiter, disguised as a swan, that was discovered in 2019. “Obviously, rich people’s homes had more paintings but [erotic images] were really very common in Pompeii,” said Gabriel Zuchtriegel, the director of Pompeii archaeological park. “Much had to do with how the Romans used Greek culture as a cultural code, as a lot of the art reflects Greek myth and stories taken from Greek traditions.” Art showing couples in explicit sex scenes has been found in excavated homes, similar to those revealed in the brothels of the ancient Roman city, which was buried by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD79. “Scholars have tended to interpret any rooms decorated with these scenes as some kind of brothel,” said Zuchtriegel. “But there was also space for prostitution inside homes.” Experts have often interpreted sexual wall paintings in the brothels as a menu of the services on offer. “It looks a bit like this as you have scenes above each single door, but it is always very risky to make this kind of simplification,” added Zuchtriegel. “The ancient daily life was just as complex as our own, and it’s risky to reconstruct what happened in these places just by judging from the images.” The exhibition will also feature art depicting homoerotic scenes, and includes a statue found in Casa del Bracciale d’Oro, or House of the Gold Bracelet, one of Pompeii’s richest homes, representing a young man who would have served his master during banquets, as well as sexually. “People look at the erotic images of Pompeii and see liberation but they also had written and unwritten rules, and it wasn’t actually this world of great liberty,” said Zuchtriegel. “Take homosexuality … it was certainly tolerated but that does not mean it offered the kind of participation and acceptance that we today are maybe wishing for.” The exhibition runs until 15 January 2023.",News/Science,Exhibition of Pompeii’s sex scenes aims to decode ancient erotica ,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/17/pompeii-sex-scenes-hint-what-happened-erotic-art-ancient
4/18/2022,"Labour said that a fresh Partygate revelation on Sunday implied that Boris Johnson instigated one of the No 10 parties that he has denied attending. The deputy Labour leader, Angela Rayner, spoke out after the Sunday Times reported that a gathering that took place in Downing Street on Friday 13 November 2020 only took on the nature of a leaving party after Johnson arrived and started pouring drinks. She said: “While the British public was making huge sacrifices, Boris Johnson was breaking the law.“If the latest reports are true, it would mean that not only did the prime minister attend parties, but he had a hand in instigating at least one of them. He has deliberately misled the British people at every turn.“The prime minister has demeaned his office. The British people deserve better. While Labour has a plan for tackling the cost of living crisis, Tory MPs are too busy defending the indefensible actions of Boris Johnson.” The revelation will intensify demands for a Commons debate this week about whether Johnson lied to parliament when he told MPs repeatedly that parties did not take place at No 10 and that Covid rules were followed at all time. The opposition parties have been discussing how best they could force a vote on this, and one possibility is tabling a motion saying Johnson has been in contempt of parliament. Johnson has already said that he intends to correct the record when MPs return to the Commons on Tuesday after their Easter break. It will be his first appearance in the chamber since accepting a fine for breaking lockdown rules at a gathering in June 2020 to mark his own birthday, and he is expected to issue a fresh apology for what he claims was an inadvertent breach of the rules. However, Johnson continues to insist that he never intentionally misled MPs in his many comments on Partygate in the Commons chamber. The ministerial code says intentionally misleading MPs – lying to them – is a resigning matter. Johnson is facing three more fines over Partygate, one of which relates to an event he attended to mark the departure of Lee Cain, his communications director, in November 2020. According to the Sunday Times, this did not feel like a leaving party until Johnson himself turned up. “He said he wanted to say a few words for Lee and started pouring drinks for people and drinking himself,” a source told the paper. This account has been confirmed to the Guardian by a source familiar with what happened. Nobody had organised a leaving do in advance – although it was usual at the time for staff in the press office to drink on Friday evenings – but apparently when Johnson encouraged people to join in, staff felt obliged to. The police are investigating this event and another gathering on the same day in the PM’s Downing Street flat, where his wife, Carrie Johnson, is alleged to have held a party to mark the departure of Cain and his ally Dominic Cummings, who had been Johnson’s chief adviser. In December last year, the Labour MP Catherine West asked Johnson directly at PMQs if there was a party in Downing Street on 13 November. Johnson replied: “No, but I am sure that whatever happened, the guidance was followed and the rules were followed at all times.” On Sunday, the Green party MP, Caroline Lucas, revealed that she had written to the Commons Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, asking if he would allow Johnson, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to be held to account by MPs for misleading parliament. Sunak also received a fixed-penalty notice last week for attending the birthday party for the PM –inadvertently, he claims – despite having told MPs he did not attend any parties. In her letter, Lucas said: “It is … appropriate that MPs have a way of scrutinising what’s happened, and for [Johnson and Sunak] potentially to be found in contempt of parliament.”Lucas added that the matter could be referred to the standards committee or the privileges committee, or MPs could hold a vote on a motion saying Johnson was in contempt of parliament. “The last would be quickest and therefore potentially most appropriate,” she said. The opposition parties, who have been discussing tactics before a potential vote, accept that Johnson would probably win because of the size of the Conservative majority. But they believe it would be embarrassing for Tory MPs to have to vote to exonerate him. On Sunday, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Brexit minister, told Radio 4’s The World This Weekend that he thought Johnson had spoken “in good faith” about Partygate. Referring to the birthday party penalty, Rees-Mogg said: “Many people would think that they were in accordance with the rules, when they were meeting people they were with every day, who happened to wish them a happy birthday, because that was the day it was. “I think that was a perfectly rational thing to believe. Now the police have decided otherwise and the police have an authority. But he wasn’t thinking something irrational or unreasonable, that that was within the rules.”",News/Politics,Report of Boris Johnson pouring drinks ‘implies he started lockdown party’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/17/report-of-boris-johnson-pouring-drinks-implies-he-started-lockdown-party-says-labour-partygate
4/18/2022,"A 30-year dispute over a fresco by the Renaissance master Piero della Francesca shows no sign of waning after an Italian court ruled that it must be returned to where it was originally painted, even though that location now predominantly serves as a cemetery. The Madonna del Parto depicts a pregnant Virgin Mary and is considered one of the greatest works from the Renaissance period. Completed in about 1460, it is believed della Francesca made the works, in situ, to adorn a wall behind the altar of the Chapel of Santa Maria di Momentana in Monterchi, a hilltop town in the Arezzo area of Tuscany. The wall and its fresco survived a devastating earthquake in 1785. The painting was later detached from the wall and displayed in an altar-niche in the rebuilt chapel, significantly reduced in size to make way for a cemetery. It was attributed to della Francesca only in 1889 and survived another earthquake in 1917 before being restored and moved in 1992 to the building of a former school in Monterchi that had been converted into the Madonna del Parto museum. The transfer to the museum, which today attracts about 40,000 visitors a year, some of them female pilgrims seeking protection during their pregnancy, sparked a tangled legal battle over the painting’s location between the council in Monterchi, the local diocese, regional authorities and the ministry of culture. The tussle entered a new stage when the Council of State, Italy’s highest administrative court, recently ruled for the painting to be returned to its original home. Alfredo Romanelli, the mayor of Monterchi, argued that the tiny chapel, located slightly on the edge of town and rebuilt again in 1956, no longer exists in its original form. “Putting the symbol of the nativity in a cemetery in the outskirts, among 3,000 graves, doesn’t seem like a good idea to me,” he told La Stampa. “It takes some imagination.” Romanelli added that the chapel is unsuitable for the masterpiece because of the light and has insufficient space to accommodate tourists. After the issue over the appropriateness of the chapel’s setting was raised in parliament, Romanelli was summoned to meet the deputy culture minister, Lucia Bergonzoni, on 20 April. He said he could not comprehend the “senseless” decision by the court and questioned who was behind it. Vittorio Sgarbi, an art critic and deputy with close ties to the former prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, said it was a good opportunity for the work to be transferred from “a vaguely clinical” location to the place where it was produced, arguing that the chapel could be expanded to make space for “religious tourism”. Della Francesca is believed to have made the painting in honour of his mother, Romana di Pierino, who was from Monterchi.",News/World news,"Piero della Francesca’s pregnant Mary to be put ‘among 3,000 graves’",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/17/italian-fresco-3000-graves-piero-della-francesca-monterchi-court
4/18/2022,"When Little Mix’s mega-tour finishes in May, the UK will be without a major girl group for the first time in decades. After winning the X Factor in 2011, Leigh-Anne Pinnock, Jade Thirlwall and Perrie Edwards have carried the torch for campy girl power, and in Newcastle, the trio show why their “extended hiatus” feels so bittersweet. Draped in neon feathers, Little Mix are suspended from the ceiling as they blast through the ultimate kiss-off anthem, Shout Out to My Ex. Confetti cannons explode and the sold-out arena crowd are going word-for-word on the track’s gleeful cutdowns. This is a show for the back rows: maximalist, assertive and heavily rhinestoned. For two breathless hours Little Mix give a lesson on the last 10 years of British pop. Bubblegum dance track Move is rightly introduced as “a bit of a classic”, while other major hits are given a refresh: reggae-pop track Woman Like Me explodes into a rock’n’roll dance break with full pyro and intensive hairography, and spiky Salute twists into Lil Nas X’s hit Industry Baby. When the feathers settle, there’s much to discuss. “So much has happened since we were last here,” Edwards says. “We’re mummies now!” she beams, gesturing to herself and Pinnock. “And … ” Her pause hangs in the air and for a second it seems like she’s going to address the absence of Jesy Nelson, who left the group in 2020. “… Jade’s a dog mummy!”“I miss those little bitches,” quips Thirlwall. It’s clear that Little Mix are joyfully taking control of their legacy. The set hinges on a transition from Between Us, a tribute to their endurance, and Love (Sweet Love), another new single that declares total independence: “I’m gonna give it to me”. Two of the three members have already announced solo careers. But their emphatic promise that Little Mix is forever (“2011 – always”) is teary and heartfelt. 2020 single Sweet Melody, the night’s closer, feels more a triumphant beginning than an ending, and Newcastle’s bars are blaring it out as the crowd find their way home.

4/18/2022,"Second-half goals from Guro Reiten and Ji So-yun ensured Chelsea eased into the FA Cup final with a patient defeat of toothless Arsenal. In front of a sold-out Borehamwood crowd the Gunners struggled to deliver a single shot on target, with Chelsea’s defensive solidity allowing them to absorb the early pressure and that they would build on in the second half. There has been very little to separate the two London teams this season. Perhaps, Chelsea, as holders of the FA Cup and the league leaders, had the edge over their title rivals going into this match. The Blues dominated from the off in a 3-0 defeat of the Gunners in the 2021 final in December. However, despite Arsenal’s league position, one point behind Chelsea, Jonas Eidevall’s team have taken four points from their two league meetings – the first three coming from a thrilling 3-2 victory at the Emirates stadium on the opening day of the season and the spoils were shared following a 0-0 draw at Kingsmeadow in February. In north London it was like time had stood still for more than two months, with the game kicking off with the same intensity and it was Arsenal, who spent much of the second half of that stalemate in February camped in Chelsea’s half, that began the brighter side. Within three minutes Beth Mead, fresh off the back of an international break in which she scored four against North Macedonia, collected a ball over the top and wrongfooted Jess Carter. But the England defender recovered to get a touch on to her pass and deflected it to the feet of defensive partner, Millie Bright, who cleared successfully. Just over 10 minutes later and Stina Blackstenius had similar success on the right, getting past the Dutch defender Aniek Nouwen and to the byline before pausing a little too long while weighing up whether to shoot or cut back allowing Chelsea to crowd the ball from her feet. For the visiting side, there was a disconnect with forward Sam Kerr, who struggled up against the new England captain, Leah Williamson. At Wembley in December Eidevall was without influential centre-back Williamson but just 10 miles north of the national stadium, at Borehamwood, it was Chelsea who were weakened by the absence of important players. Their captain and centre-back, Magda Eriksson, was deemed only fit enough for the bench, forcing Emma Hayes to begin with a back three of Nouwen, Bright and Carter. Meanwhile, England international Fran Kirby, whose third-minute goal and potent partnership with Kerr lit up the final, was ruled out for the foreseeable future by Hayes prior to Sunday’s game as the hunt for answers to Kirby’s fatigue problem continue. Despite the fluidity to their play Arsenal struggled to make it count. The fierce strike from the edge of the box from Vivianne Miedema that sailed narrowly over the bar highlighted their profligacy and the Gunners finished a dominant half on the back foot. First, Miedema gifted the ball to the Chelsea forward Erin Cuthbert before recovering the ball with a stunning sliding tackle. Then, Williamson was at fault, delivering the ball straight to England before dispossessing her international teammate shortly after as Chelsea upped the ante. At half-time the home side were without a shot on target, to Chelsea’s two, and the team’s lack of cutting edge in front of goal would prove to be their undoing. Within minutes of Mead swivelling in the box and firing wide, Reiten floated towards the edge of the D and lifted a curling shot across the goal and into the far corner. Sign up for our new and free women’s football newsletter Chelsea had a second just after the hour mark and, despite a defensive mess, Arsenal had cause to feel aggrieved after the full-back Steph Catley recovered possession for the home team but was penalised for handball despite it deflecting off her face. Bright lofted the resulting free-kick from deep within the Chelsea half to Kerr, the Arsenal defender Lotte Wubben-Moy was able to prod the ball away but her clearance fell to Ji who stepped past Lia Wälti and fired in to set up a final against Manchester City, who beat the Blues 3-1 in the Continental League Cup final on 5 March.",Sport/Football,Chelsea sink Arsenal to set up Women’s FA Cup final with Manchester City,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/17/arsenal-v-chelsea-womens-fa-cup-semi-final-match-report
