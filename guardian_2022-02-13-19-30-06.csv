2/13/2022,"Cable news ratings are in sharp decline, public trust in journalists is at all-time low, and one of most famous names in the media business is in a post-pandemic C-suite crisis ahead of an important midterm election.  But the money keeps rolling in, at roughly a billion dollars a year in profit to its parent company, AT&T’s WarnerMedia, while data-driven content decisions push the network toward tabloid-like obsessions and a tone rooted in exaggeration and alarm. CNN, the company founded in 1980 by Ted Turner on the back of revenue from one of the largest classic film libraries in the world, has found itself at a crossroads that internally at least resembles a crisis. Two weeks ago CNN president Jeff Zucker was abruptly fired for failing to disclose a romantic relationship with a senior colleague. Few believe the narrative, since the relationship had been common knowledge for years, and at least one CNN host, Don Lemon, shed on-air tears at Zucker’s departure. Zucker’s departure appeared more likely related to another scandalous firing, that of show host Chris Cuomo, who is suing the network for up to $60m after being axed for playing an outsized and undeclared role in shaping the defense of his brother, former New York governor Andrew Cuomo, against sexual harassment allegations. The scandals echo previous episodes in which executives at top American TV organizations have been accused of operating a culture of impunity for other senior, almost always male, executives. It seems to illustrate a broader problem in the top echelons of these firms: supremely powerful organizations whose leaderships seem to have assumed that normal rules did not apply to them. Take CNN’s great rival, Fox News. In 2016, Fox News chief Roger Ailes was fired after a sexual harassment scandal. A lawsuit filed by shareholders, naming Ailes’ estate as well as 21st Century Fox’s controlling shareholder, Rupert Murdoch, alleged that Ailes had “sexually harassed female employees and contributors with impunity for at least a decade” and that Murdoch and others had allowed Fox News anchor Bill O’Reilly to harass several female employees. The company paid out $55m to settle claims of sexual harassment, and lost top female anchors including Megyn Kelly, Greta Van Susteren and Gretchen Carlson in the aftermath. The Fox News scandal was followed two years later by a sexual harassment scandal involving CBS CEO Leslie Moonves that included allegations of an attempted cover-up by CBS executives. Moonves was later denied a $120m severance package. That followed the firing of Charlie Rose, co-anchor of CBS’s morning show, in November 2017 after several women accused him of harassment and misconduct. But CNN’s problems, while lacking comparable accusations against Zucker, whose relationship was consensual, suggests other problems are at play in a new sector in a state of near constant turmoil. CNN viewership in the first week of January was down 90% overall and in the critical demographic coveted by advertisers from a year earlier, while the network – like that of its ideological and previously scandal-plagued counterpoint Fox News – is drawing criticism for editorial positions. According to Ariana Pekary, public editor for CNN at the Columbia Journalism Review and MSNBC journalist who now focuses on the systemic flaws of commercial broadcast news, a narrative of a toxic, male-dominated culture does not fully describe the issues at hand in the US broadcast sector. Instead some of the problems involve what’s on the screen, not whose behind it. “Zucker was hyper-focused on ratings and financial incentives and that drove the changes in news toward opinion because opinion drives ratings,” said Pekary. “CNN is more about trying to creative a narrative that they think the audience will follow, so they build the coverage around certain characters that are in the news every day or will reappear.” Zucker had been brought in to CNN in 2012, two years after leaving NBC, where he had driven the entertainment division’s ratings with shows like Donald Trump’s The Apprentice, which helped re-establish his public image and, some argue, made his presidency possible. Despite Zucker’s background in reality TV and morning news, CNN’s then-parent company, Time Warner, hired Zucker to improve ratings and inject “more passion” into programming. According to the Washington Post, Zucker succeeded in making the network profitable, by expanding programming beyond news. Anthony Bourdain’s Parts Unknown was among the new offerings, along with a new documentary division designed to create programming for weekend viewers. Pekary walked out of MSNBC in 2020, writing on her website that coming from public radio, “where no decision I ever witnessed was predicated on how a topic or guest would “rate” , at cable news “I saw such choices – it’s practically baked in to the editorial process – and those decisions affect news content every day”. The pressure of making editorial decisions based on polling and audience data, Pekary explains, starts in the morning news meetings – where Zucker was famously an ever-present force at CNN. “That’s why the coverage from hour-to-hour sticks to the same stories and narratives. They make decisions on what they think is going to rate the best, based on what has done well, and to social media.” Pekary noted recently that in the absence of Donald Trump to drive ratings, CNN had pushed aggressively into “the realm of tabloid-like material”. There was Gabby Petito, the Long Island woman murdered by her boyfriend in Wyoming, and Alec Baldwin’s involvement in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. The problem is not exclusive to cable news, but only exaggerated. Devotion to ratings, reasons Pekary, has warped editorial control and the credibility of cable news and the news business overall. According to data from Edelman’s annual trust barometer, 56% of Americans agree with the statement that “journalists and reporters are purposely trying to mislead people by saying things they know are false or gross exaggerations”. An even larger percentage – 58% – said they thought that “most news organizations are more concerned with supporting an ideology or political position than with informing the public”. For CNN, the Cuomo saga began with Chris Cuomo often interviewing his brother on air – a clear conflict of interest – before morphing into a sexual harassment confrontation. After Jeffrey Toobin, a longstanding CNN legal analyst, exposed himself on a Zoom call with colleagues at the New Yorker, he was put back on air. Devotion to data has created opportunities for competition from other, occasionally contentious, sources. Two weeks ago, podcaster Joe Rogan found himself in a public feud with Neil Young and others over Covid misinformation. Pekary says that cable news could redeem itself if it focused more on news gathering and less on selling opinion, which is cheaper to produce outside the massive salaries for on-air talent. It matters less is who is in charge. But with CNN making $1bn in profit for its parent company, the incentive to change is limited. “No matter who is in charge I don’t see that format changing as much as I believe it should,” she said. “They spend an awful lot of time, especially in primetime, rehashing the outrage of the day when they could produce much better news programming with a different format that actually informs a larger audience but they’re going for the lowest common denominator.”",News/Media,How CNN’s crisis echoes previous episodes at top US TV networks ,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/13/cnn-jeff-zucker-chris-cuomo-fox-news
2/13/2022,"At time of writing, I am bored with being told that Boris Johnson’s government is on the brink of collapse. It’s been talked about constantly for weeks. The “senior” Tory backbenchers, the thrusting new “red wall” backbenchers, the “former ministers”, the “ex-chief whips” – I’ve lost count – all of them pissed off, not taking any more of this shit, saying he’s got to resign, he’s lost confidence, it’s over, I never liked him, his wife’s a bitch, etc. They’ve all been doing their letters, or thinking about doing their letters, to the 1922 Committee. No one knows quite how many letters there are – maybe they haven’t all been posted. Is it 30? It could be 40! It needs to be 54. David Davis even did the “In the name of God, go” bit in the Commons. Surely that’s the cue? He must be feeling embarrassed now, like he’s failed to get a Mexican wave going. Cromwell used that speech to usher in martial law, Leo Amery’s quoting it got rid of Chamberlain within a couple of days, but Johnson just ignored it and “got on with the job” of slandering the leader of the opposition and singing disco hits to his new director of communications.  I’ve been nervous to mention the prime minister in these columns recently, so fervent have been the assurances of dozens of his former allies that he’s about to go. I didn’t want to embarrass the print media by exposing its lead times. He won’t be prime minister by Sunday, so mentioning him will make the whole article irrelevant, I’ve been telling myself. But it’s getting ridiculous. So I’m taking the risk and if he’s out of office by the time you read this, it’ll be the first ever case of regime change expedited by sod’s law. The latest person solemnly predicting Johnson’s doom is a man called John Armitage, who is a major Tory donor, as well as, rather eccentrically, a minor Labour donor – seems like an expensive way of telling the Lib Dems you don’t like them. He’s very upset about things, saying he finds “the lack of honour inherent in modern politics incredibly distressing”, but he’s given more than £500,000 to the Conservative party since Johnson became prime minister, so it’s hard to think what more he could have done. Armitage’s interview with the BBC is remarkable mainly for his uncanny vocal similarity to former cabinet minister Rory Stewart. It’s quite weird. He could make good money as a Stewart impersonator if he hadn’t already made £600m from managing a hedge fund. When asked whether he felt the prime minister was “past the point of no return”, Armitage said: “Well, personally, yes.” And that means “prime minister past point of no return, says Tory donor” can be added to the litany of teasing. The problem with this prolonged period of anticipation is that all the voices raised in protest against Johnson’s government start to sound shrill, like Kermit the Frog endlessly introducing an act that never comes on. The prime minister has understood this from the moment the current scandal broke. He’s let the evidence of all the various No 10 booze-ups accumulate, until the specifics get jumbled – the summer party, the assorted leaving dos, the cheese and wine, the Christmas one, the one the TV lady resigned for, the eve of the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral drinks, was it? I think there was a birthday cake at some point? But not the one in the photo – that was presented to him by a school. He’s done a bit of piecemeal apologising as he went along, but for ages the main message was: “We have to wait for Sue Gray’s report so we can all find out what I’ve done. I’m as interested to hear as everyone else!” We waited for Sue to sort it out and produce a handy list, like a statement telling you exactly what items a fraudster has bought on your credit card, so we could organise our annoyance properly. But it never happened; before her report came out we’d already been told it wouldn’t be a proper one at the insistence of the relentlessly disappointing Metropolitan police. So the report is redacted and we’re waiting for the police to investigate. What could that possibly involve other than reading Gray’s report? Creeping round the cabinet room looking for remnants of party popper and carbon-dateable shards of Twiglet? No, they say they’re going to send round an email questionnaire that “must be answered truthfully”. That should do the trick. Some fines might be issued at some point. Perhaps the conclusions could be announced during the next World Cup. We all know that the longer this goes on, the more likely the prime minister will get away with it. There are so many distractions that could save him. There might be a war in Ukraine; he suddenly suggested he might end the legal requirement to isolate with Covid; he did a mini-reshuffle two days after refreshing his core team and he could always do another; even consternation about NHS waiting lists currently helps him because he can make Sajid Javid do the talking. The moaning Tories won’t fundamentally mind this. If he survives, they’ll stop saying he’s rearranging deckchairs on the Titanic and start saying he’s steadied the ship, refreshed by the sensation of a different cliche. They’ll congratulate themselves for having intervened, brought Boris to heel and bagged up all his little turds. But what are the opposition supposed to do? They’re still shouting about these parties, occasions of such hypocrisy, dishonesty and bad faith it beggars belief that they haven’t destroyed the government. More time passes and people get used to the parties. It’s not as if politicians seemed honest before the pandemic. Those who didn’t have to watch relatives die over Zoom will, if they don’t forgive, sort of forget, get bored. Another party photo emerged last week. You can feel the potency of the issue dissipating. It doesn’t look that shocking. An open bottle of champagne, crisps on the desk and tinsel round a man’s neck. If it’s a party, it’s a shit one. The Met announced that it will now review its previous decision not to investigate it. That sounds time consuming.",Opinion/Opinion,Sod’s law says Boris Johnson will be gone by now | David Mitchell,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/13/sods-law-says-boris-johnson-will-be-gone-by-now
2/13/2022,"On a hillside an hour from Madrid, not far from the sepulchral splendour of the Escorial monastery, with its royal tombs, imperial maps and sacred relics, lies another, rather less austere, treasure house. The Gladys Palmera collection, kept in a sprawling, tropical-hued complex crammed with 1950s Mexican film posters and prowled by the odd decorative monkey and jaguar, is the largest private archive of Latin American music in the world.  In its numerous niches and cabinets and on its many, many shelves sit 60,000 records, 50,000 CDs and countless cassettes and digital audio tapes, offering everything from bolero to garage rock, and from salsa to reggaetón. After a decade near the Spanish capital, however, the collection could cross the Atlantic as the woman who has spent the past 30 years amassing it ponders donating its riches to a worthy – and preferably noisy – new home. Among the archive’s scores of highlights are a rare green vinyl LP by the Cuban musician Arsenio Rodríguez, a pink-and-silver sequinned dress worn by the Afro-Cuban superstar Celia Cruz, and a recording of James Dean, released in 1957, behaving like a good coffee-house beatnik and playing the congas. The complex also houses an online radio network that plays classic, contemporary and rare tracks, an exhaustive online catalogue and a brand new record label. Although the collection now encompasses photos, posters, flyers, songbooks, magazines, books and personal memorabilia, it remains founded on one woman’s love for the songs she heard as a child. Alejandra Fierro Eleta, a Spanish-Panamanian radio broadcaster, grew up in Madrid listening to records by Toña la Negra, Elvira Ríos, Cuco Valoy, Cuco Sánchez, Lucho Gatica and Amalia Mendoza that her father brought back from his business trips to Latin America. “I was listening to all this music from the cradle,” says Fierro. “I started helping myself to his records when I was little.” By the time she was 12, she had also developed a passion for ham radio and for talking to people across the airwaves. “There came a day when I didn’t know what to do with my life and I said to myself, ‘Well, what do you like?’, and I thought Cuban music and amateur radio. So I thought I’d like a radio programme.” But her father had one stipulation: “When I told my dad I was going to be on the radio, he said, ‘Not with my name, you’re not’.” Casting around for a suitable alter ego, Fierro decided to use the name Gladys – a family joke with one of her brothers – and felt that Palmera (palm tree) would serve as a suitably tropical surname. “It came to me in a second and ever since then I’ve been Gladys Palmera.” After starting her radio career on a small station near Madrid, Fierro worked for a national chain before setting up Radio Gladys Palmera in 1999 to broadcast Latin music to Barcelona and then to Madrid and Valencia. A decade later, she had swapped FM for the internet and was learning more about collecting and conserving rare vinyl. Fierro and her small team have scoured the internet and record fairs to put together an archive made up of purchases from more than 40 countries, including several pre-existing collections. Her colleague José Arteaga once tried to work out how long it would take to listen to the entire archive. “I calculated it would take 62 years to listen to everything,” he says. “But that was a while ago. Perhaps it would be 80 years now.” But, despite the size of the archive, Fierro says it’s “not about quantity – it’s about really, really high quality”. At the end of last year, the collection launched its record label with the release, on 10-inch vinyl, of two late-1960s songs by the Guantanamo Boys. It will be followed over the coming months by a contemporary release, a compilation of 60s and 70s music from New York and the Caribbean, and some remixes. Fierro has an eye on the longer term, too. In 2009, she set up La Escuelita del Ritmo (The Little School of Rhythm) in Portobelo, a Panamanian town that reminds her of Gabriel García Márquez’s fictional Macondo. The free academy helps local children develop their musical, artistic and performance skills as they learn how to play instruments and build and decorate cajones, or drum boxes. Plans for residencies by DJs and production experts are also in the pipeline. Three decades and countless acquisitions later, Fierro has her own future to consider. She has set up the Gladys Palmera Foundation to ensure the survival of the collection and its attendant enterprises, and the search has begun for a permanent home for the archive – possibly in the US. “I’m trying to find a space for all this because I’m 63 and my health isn’t good,” she says. “This is a temple to music and I want to donate it all.” There will, inevitably, be conditions. Fierro wants the collection kept out of the cold, anonymous confines of a traditional museum. Wherever it ends up, it will need to be “a buzzing place with a multi-use space for concerts and exhibitions”. She gives short shrift to the idea that the collection is simply the culmination of decades of a very personal passion. “It’s not an obsession – even if it may look like one,” she says. “What I’m aiming for here is excellence; to build the best collection there is and to do it properly. This isn’t about me and my life – I don’t care about that – it’s about showcasing all this work here. It needs to be shared.”",Arts/Music,"The rumba radio station, the DJ … and 110,000 albums looking for a noisy new home",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/13/gladys-palmera-archive-madrid-latin-american-music
2/13/2022,"Five planes from Egyptian resorts returned to Boryspil airport yesterday, picked up new passengers and flew back. A plane also flew in from the Cuban resort of Varadero, where my friend, the publisher Anetta Antonenko, recently had 10 days rest. Ukrainians are already used to warming up and sunbathing in Egypt in winter. I do not know how they feel now, flying to warmer climes. Do they take with them documents for their property and everything that the Ukrainian government advised its citizens to put in one “emergency suitcase”, along with a supply of food for two days, a change of underwear and personal documents?  Actually, I checked the departures/arrivals website because the British embassy sent an email to my English wife with a warning that she and the children must leave while there are commercial flights. If they stay, they should not count on the help of the embassy. I am not British, I am a citizen of Ukraine. Nobody sends me emails demanding I leave as soon as possible. My wife decided to stay. As did our sons Theo and Anton, who do not want to go anywhere. The elder, Theo, works at an animation film studio and recently signed a contract until the end of May. Anton is 19 and waiting for spring to fix a 1974 Soviet Moskvich car he bought a year ago for $800. In the past two days, there have been many statements from the United States, Canada, Japan and other countries announcing that almost all diplomats are leaving Ukraine, as there is information that active hostilities, including city bombing, may begin in the next 48 hours. But as long as the planes are flying, I am calm. Not only that, my wife and I are going to dinner with the ambassador of Brazil tonight. Brazil has not yet made any announcements. My friend said that we should actually keep an eye on the Chinese embassy. As soon as it announces the evacuation of its employees, then the threat of war must be taken seriously. Russia will definitely warn China before bombing Kyiv. They are now strategic partners. The Chinese embassy is silent for now. Our close friends, an elderly Japanese-French couple, are at a loss. They have been living in Kyiv for a long time, they bought two large apartments in the centre. One is for rent, the other is for living, as is the case with many of the foreigners who moved to Ukraine. They too don’t want to go anywhere. The war barometer in Kyiv is exchange rates and statements by the president, Volodymyr Zelensky. If the dollar and the euro rise sharply against the hryvnia, then the war has become even closer. Today, the dollar and the euro have risen in price more than usual. But, in truth, in recent weeks they have already been at this level and even more expensive. Petrol has already risen noticeably in price too, but it is still cheaper than in the UK. Zelensky again reassured Ukrainians and said that everything was under control. He has repeatedly accused western politicians of exaggerating the danger of a Russian attack, though after his speeches, I feel as if he’s downplayed the threat. I am one of many Ukrainians who has to change euros and dollars regularly to pay for living and utility bills. My main income comes from selling books abroad. A week ago, I went to the exchange office, where the rate is usually very good. A young guy was standing at the window of the exchange office and changing several packs of $100 bills for hryvnias. An employee approached me and said: “This client has a very large amount, the cashier will be busy for a long time. How much do you want to change?” “One hundred dollars,” I replied. “Tanya, give me small change, for a hundred dollars!” Putting the hryvnias in my pocket, I went outside and for the first time thought about the fact that $100 no longer means so much in Ukraine. Prices in the country have long since become European, while ordinary salaries and pensions have largely remained post-Soviet. Most of my neighbours in the village receive a pension of just over $100 a month. But they usually have large stocks of vegetables and canned food in the cellar. However, civil servants in Kyiv receive salaries of thousands of dollars a month. They live in a different reality. Now both of these realities are under threat. Under the threat of war. Yesterday, I noticed that the exchange office where I changed money the other day had already closed. Disappeared. It is no more. But there are several other exchanges nearby. As long as banks and exchange offices are open, you can be relatively calm. Today, my friend invited my wife and me to one of the best restaurants in Kyiv for his birthday. Next Saturday, 19 February. Does this mean that there will be no war until 19 February? I really hope so. I’ve lost a lot because of the pandemic – trips abroad, book festivals and exhibitions and also, for we need pleasure, dinners in good restaurants. I wouldn’t want to lose everything again, this time because of the war. It’s so strange to think that the whole world now depends on what can happen in the head of a single, ageing man.",Opinion/Opinion,"I’ve a nice dinner date this week in Kyiv.

2/13/2022,"With a handshake and brief embrace, congresswoman Abigail Spanberger welcomed Joe Biden to her Virginia district last Thursday. The event was an opportunity to highlight the administration’s plans to lower the cost of prescription drugs, but it also provided an opportunity for the US president to promote the members of his party ahead of the midterm elections in November. “In every chapter in her career, in every chapter, she’s always been about one thing: service,” the president said of Spanberger, a Democrat whose competitive re-election race is on the front line of the battle for control of the House.  It is a crucial effort: Democrats already face a punishing political climate as they defend their paper-thin majorities in the House and Senate. The president’s party typically loses seats during the midterm elections and a president’s popularity is a key variable in determining the extent of those losses. Widespread economic discontent and frustration over the pandemic have battered Biden’s approval ratings, now hovering just above 40%, according to public polls. Underscoring the deep challenges confronting his presidency, Biden arrived in Culpepper, Virginia, hours after the release of another grim economic report, showing inflation rising by 7.5% over the last year, its highest level in 40 years. The present reality poses a dilemma for some Democrats: embrace an unpopular president or shun the leader of their party. Republicans have called the choice the “burden of Biden”, targeting members who appear with him, like Spanberger, over their support for the president while accusing those who don’t of avoiding him. Practically a perennial midterm predicament for the party in power, the question of whether to put daylight between vulnerable candidates and Biden comes as he prepares to ramp up travel outside Washington. This week he will travel to Ohio, where Democrats are trying to flip a Senate seat. Some Democrats are hopeful the personal appeal of Biden – known as the consummate retail politician – will help them sell their agenda and improve his party’s prospects later this year. “If you are trying to distance yourself from Biden, you’re doing it wrong,” said Lanae Erickson, senior vice-president at the moderate thinktank Third Way. Many of the most fiercely contested House races are anchored in the suburbs, which powered the party’s victories during the Trump years but where Democrats have struggled recently. Erickson said Biden remains the party’s best spokesman. A visit from him, she continued, telegraphs to swing voters that “this is the party of Joe Biden, it’s not the party of Bernie Sanders, and that’s what we’re offering when it comes to November”. In recent weeks, some Democrats have not attended events where Biden is speaking, giving grist to Republicans eager to amplify the narrative that they are avoiding him. On a trip to Georgia, where Biden delivered a major speech on voting rights, gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, a prominent voting rights advocate, was not in attendance, citing a scheduling conflict. In Pittsburgh last month, Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro, the probable Democratic nominee in the race for governor, did not attend the president’s speech on infrastructure – also due to an apparent scheduling conflict. Both insisted at the time politics had no bearing on their decision. Abrams and Biden flatly rejected any notion of friction. But there are other signs that Democrats in difficult races are trying to put daylight between themselves and the president. Asked whether he would accept Biden’s help, Beto O’Rourke, who is vying to become the next governor of Texas, told reporters he was “not interested” in receiving campaign assistance from anyone outside his state. Other Democrats have hedged, offering neither an emphatic yes or a definitive no. An analysis by Axios, using data compiled by Quorum, found that many at-risk Democrats avoided any mention of the president on their official campaign accounts since 1 September, when Biden’s approval began a precipitous decline after the chaotic withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. Still, several Democrats in key races have welcomed the president. Georgia senator Raphael Warnock, who faces a difficult re-election fight, appeared alongside Biden during his voting rights speech. Congressman Conor Lamb, a candidate for Senate in Pennsylvania, was in the audience in Pittsburgh when Biden mistakenly referred to him as “senator”. In December, Kansas congresswoman Sharice Davids flew with Biden on Air Force One to her district, where they touted the benefits of the bipartisan infrastructure law. And he also appeared at an event with Michigan congresswoman Elissa Slotkin to push for passage of the law. Presidential visits often drive fundraising and attract media attention.​ An appearance by Biden could help amplify Democrats’ economic agenda while serving to dispel concerns about his age, said Mike Noble, a pollster in Arizona, where senator Mark Kelly is defending his seat in one of the marquee races of the cycle. A recent survey of Arizona voters, conducted by OH Predictive Insights, Noble’s polling and research firm, found that the economy had overtaken immigration as a top priority for voters in the border state. At the same time, approval of his handling of the economy and the pandemic had fallen sharply. “You can either be reactive or proactive,” he said. “And we’re seeing that being reactive has not been great for his numbers here.” At a press conference last month, Biden said he planned to be more “deeply involved” in the midterm elections. And though he expressed an eagerness to travel on behalf of his party, it is highly unlikely Biden would appear anywhere he is not wanted. “We’re going to be raising a lot of money. We’re going to be out there making sure that we’re helping all of those candidates,” he said. “And scores of them have already asked me to come in and campaign with them, to go out and make the case in plain, simple language as to what it is we’ve done, what we want to do, and why we think it’s important.” But it is not easy. Once popular with a wide cross-section of voters, Biden’s appeal among conservatives has all but vanished as he attempts to lead a divided America out of a pandemic and economic crisis. His appearances almost always draw protesters, often waving vulgar signs as Donald Trump continues to spread lies about the results of the 2020 election. Alarming Democrats is his slipping support among critical parts of the party’s coalition, including Black, Latino, young and female voters deflated by his failure to enact a bold agenda and disappointment that life remains far from “normal” more than a year into his presidency. The collapse of legislative efforts to protect voting rights and enact police reform should worry Democrats more than an appearance by the president, said Cliff Albright, a co-founder of the Atlanta-based advocacy group Black Voters Matter. In a recent survey by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, nearly a quarter of Georgia voters named voting and elections as their top priority, the highest percentage of any issue, including the economy. Concern was especially pronounced among Black voters, whose disapproval of the president soared from just 8% in May to 36% in January. Even a marginal drop in Black voter turnout in November could spell trouble for Democrats in November, particularly in Georgia, where Biden won by less than half a percentage point. “We didn’t vote for him because we thought he was a great speaker or a great motivator,” Albright said. “We thought he would be able to govern and help pass legislation.” Four years ago, voter fury against Trump lifted Spanberger to victory over Republican David Brat, an arch-conservative. Spanberger has been a top Republican target ever since, but she held on in 2020, defeating her Republican challenger by less than two percentage points. This year she will run in a district that has been dramatically redrawn, and now tilts more heavily in her favor. Whereas Biden narrowly won her district in 2020, it’s projected he would have won the new district by seven points. But the increased margin is little comfort after Democrats’ stunning defeat in Virginia’s gubernatorial election last year, when Republican Glenn Youngkin stormed to victory in the state, which Biden won by 10 percentage points in 2020. The shocking losses in Virginia, thought to have turned reliably blue, came amid Democratic infighting over the size and scope of the president’s domestic agenda, which remains stalled in the Senate. In an interview after the election, Spanberger suggested that Biden had overreached with his expansive domestic agenda, telling the New York Times “nobody elected him to be FDR; they elected him to be normal and stop the chaos.” After the interview was published, Spanberger said she got a call from the White House. When Biden came to the phone, he teased: “Hello, Abigail. It’s president Roosevelt.” Speaking with reporters before Thursday’s event in Culpepper, Spanberger said she welcomed the opportunity for Biden to hear directly from her constituents, like ​​Joshua Davis, a 12-year-old with diabetes who introduced him. “I have the opportunity to literally give my constituents the opportunity to tell their stories to the president of the United States,” she said “That’s, for me, the height of what representation can and should be.” At this stage in the cycle, Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said the choice to appear with the president in a part of the state he won to discuss a part of his agenda that is wildly popular was an “obvious one” for Spanberger. He cautioned that much could change before November. “But if this were October, with these kinds of ratings,” Sabato said, “I think she’d have a scheduling conflict.”",News/US news,Embrace or avoid?

2/13/2022,"Iread recently that in the first age of computing doctors treated office workers for a condition named “turtle neck”, caused by long hours squinting at a screen. I just used to get RSI, but we’ll let that pass. Now, in the early days of the metaverse, there’s an altogether more unpleasant sounding hazard – “gorilla arms”. Rather than being seated, users of augmented reality and virtual reality devices are usually standing without support. Explains Jay Kim of Oregon State University: “By sticking your arms forward far away from your body, that creates shoulder strain that’s called gorilla arm syndrome.” So now you know. There have also been incidents of users punching walls, lampshades and ceiling fans. Alas, the medical profession has yet to come up with names for these conditions, but I eagerly await them. In the meantime, if you injure yourself lumbering about in the metaverse, blame that Mark Zuckerberg and add it to the increasing charge sheet against that wretched man and his supposedly brave new world.

A good pun should be truly groanworthy and Mr Pulsford acquits himself honourably on that front: “I used to work in a lighthouse – I still get flashbacks”; “Doorbells. You can’t knock ’em”; “Rocket countdowns? Don’t get me started.” Yes, I admit it - I’m a sucker for puns. And a special mention must go to another competitor, Chris Norton-Walker: “If you’re going to walk 10,000 miles, wear the correct footwear and consult a doctor. The Disclaimers.” My all-time favourite appeared in a local Essex newspaper, decrying a crisis in the county’s libraries: “Book lack in Ongar”. John Osborne must be turning in his grave.

2/13/2022,"Afew years ago, I had a fan. She had read my writing and listened to my podcast, and often replied warmly to my tweets. Occasionally, she would send me private messages, and eventually I started following her back. It was nice. At some point, the volume of communication increased – I began receiving emails, and the notifications and messages spread to Instagram. Then they grew more frequent, uncomfortably so. She wanted things from me: to work for me, to meet up with me, to know how my weekend had gone, to tell me how hers had gone, to tell me about the job she disliked, for me to help her with a project she was launching. My heart began to sink whenever I saw her name appear on my phone and I started responding less and less in the hope of discouraging her overtures. Then she came to an event I’d organised – the first time we’d actually met – and to my mortification, presented me with a bundle of gifts (which I obviously sent a thank you message for – I’m not a monster).  After a period where rarely a day would go by without some form of contact – invitations for coffee, lunch, to her house (all politely declined) – I texted a friend asking for advice. The attention had become suffocating, but I also felt a little guilty. She was pleasant enough, if somewhat intense. In the end, I chose the coward’s way out. I blocked her on social media and felt an immediate sense of relief as I did so. It probably wasn’t the kindest way of dealing with the situation, but I also reasoned that feeling anxious on account of a stranger’s expectations of friendship from me wasn’t what I’d signed up for as a writer. After that, I never heard from her again. I’d fallen victim to the consequences of a parasocial relationship. The term describes people forming intense – and crucially, one-sided – attachments to celebrities or public figures. I’ve seen that word, “parasocial”, used on social media to describe everything from speculation around Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck’s surprise reunion, to Taylor Swift fans’ feverish discussion of her relationship with ex-boyfriend Jake Gyllenhaal. Unsurprisingly, during the pandemic these sorts of relationships have assumed heightened importance. For many of us, periodically trapped at home and unable to socialise, our favourite creators and media personalities have stepped into the breach left by our real-life friends. We feel as if we know these people and, indeed, we sort of do – we know how old they were when they had their first kiss, and how long it took them to get over their last break-up, what their bathrooms look like perhaps, and where they’re going on holiday next month. We feel like we’re sort of friends, or would be friends given the opportunity. Now, I’m not actually famous, so the intensity of parasocial fandom my writing has invited is generally tolerable, and usually even pleasant – but I often consider what it must be like to have a bigger platform, and to have thousands, or perhaps even millions of people who think of you as a friend. “I think sometimes people with larger platforms or audiences have a level of protection,” says the actor Evanna Lynch, who rose to fame playing Luna Lovegood in the Harry Potter movies, and who says the messages she receives from fans are often prefaced with the assumption that she’ll never actually see them. “When you have a smaller, more intimate audience, I think people do expect a reply, and they feel like you’re very close.” This is the paradox of low-level fame – the kind bestowed on popular podcast hosts or minor media personalities; people who have a public profile, but are still “normal” enough for their followers to assume a degree of kinship. And, of course, social media, where dispatches from celebrities sit side by side with updates from our closest friends, actively encourages this sense of proximity and the blurring of lines. Our exposure to celebrities is no longer limited to the press junkets accompanying a movie release or album drop – instead the steady drip-feed of social media bestows on us constant updates on the minutiae of their lives. Having starred in one of the most successful movie franchises of all time, Lynch has a colossal following (3.8m followers on Instagram alone) – and though she emphasises the many positive encounters she’s had with fans who’ve reached out to her, the ease of access fostered by social media has also at times invited more uncomfortable interactions. “Sometimes it can go a bit too far with people expecting too much of you. I would find myself busy and not able to reply, and then they’d get angry – with some people even saying, ‘If you don’t reply to me, I’m going to do something to myself.’ “One guy – I’ll never forget – wrote me novel-length letters on Facebook every day, talking to me as if I was his best friend and telling me about his life. Sometimes he’d be really friendly and sweet, and other days he’d be furious because I actually never replied.” Lynch was a teenager at the time. “I sort of had the sense even then that there’s something not right here,” she adds, though she speaks about this particular fan with considerable empathy. Over time, she has changed the way she engages with fans. “I’m much more guarded now – I usually don’t reply to those messages, because there’s a fragility there that can be quite dangerous to entertain when you’re somebody who they revere so much.” If ever there was a media format that lends itself to parasocial fandom, it is the podcast. The way we consume them – one-to-one, a familiar voice chattering away in our ears, often in the privacy of our own homes – makes podcasts a particularly intimate experience, and for many listeners that “friendship experience” is a huge part of their appeal. This is something that Zara McDonald and Michelle Andrews, both 27 and co-hosts of one of Australia’s most popular podcasts, Shameless, know all too well. The duo were close friends before starting the podcast, and their weekly analysis of celebrity and pop culture now pulls in an impressive 1.6m downloads a month, mainly from 20-something women – but it’s their friendship as much as their musings on the latest Kardashian scandal that drives the podcast’s popularity. “People are invested in the dynamic between us and our bond,” Andrews notes. “Even now, four years into doing the show, we still on occasion receive DMs that imply we’re not actually friends, or that we’re trying to deceive people and don’t actually like each other – that we secretly fight behind the scenes and aren’t as close as we appear on the show.” As well as projections about the nature of Andrews and McDonald’s friendship, some listeners have also projected the expectation of friendship on to the duo. “We’ve been invited out to social events with listeners, who sometimes get a little confused when we don’t respond, or are quite surprised when we don’t want to go to dinner with them,” Andrews tells me – and the consequences of not indulging what fans perceive to be a reciprocal relationship can be disconcerting. The pair describe a “flipping of the switch”, where their most ardent fans have occasionally become hostile when the pair fail to engage with them, sending aggressive DMs and leaving critical comments about the show on social media. I, too, have experienced fans whose mood turns sour when they consider themselves spurned – one minute sending congratulations on the publication of my book, the next suggesting that I am “full of shit”. After Andrews and McDonald published a book in 2019, in which Andrews detailed the sexual assault she’d experienced at 18, she received hundreds of messages from women who’d suffered similar trauma – something she was totally unprepared for. Though she repeatedly took to social media to plead with her followers not to send personal accounts of their assaults, for the sake of her own mental health, she felt considerable pressure to provide the kind of emotional support one would usually expect from an actual friend – or a therapist. “I really struggled mentally with the tsunami of sexual assault stories.” she remembers. “I had some people get incredibly upset with me, that they’d sent me a story and I didn’t respond or give some form of mentorship. There was 1% of women who got very aggrieved or angry when those stories weren’t responded to.” It’s clear that the pair have learned the hard way to establish rock-solid boundaries as their profiles have risen. When I ask if any of their listeners have ever crossed the line from fan to friend, the answer is an unequivocal “no”. “We will always be polite and friendly with fans who approach us, but there won’t be a one-on-one situation where we’re DMing a fan back and forth over weeks.” And yet for every creator for whom parasocial relationships are an unintended byproduct of their work, there are many more – influencers, YouTubers, vloggers – who actively cultivate that faux-intimacy with their followers, softening them up so that they might more easily ply their wares, be that waist trainers or make-up brushes. The currency of personal information is something fashion influencer Camille Charrière is well aware of. As one of the industry’s most established influencers – Charrière has 1.2m followers on Instagram – she is refreshingly honest about the professional incentives to overshare online. “Sharing your children, your boyfriend, the inside of your home, perhaps about your mental health or other illness struggles, family stuff – all of that performs better on social media. Anything that is very intimate and relatable, and that other people can identify with. The things that used to work – keeping it impersonal and just showing your outfits, like we used to do – don’t really work any more. That’s something that anyone with a large social media following will be able to see: which posts generate higher engagement.” By design, social media algorithms reward the type of disclosure that invites parasociality. In the digital age, many creators’ livelihoods depend on that ever elusive and highly sought after metric of “engagement”, prompting them to offer up an access-all-areas pass to their lives – and the politics of personal disclosure are especially fraught for women. “I think there is something about women in [media] roles, where they are expected to share more of themselves,” McDonald suggests. Though she acknowledges that she and Andrews have freely chosen to share personal stories with their audiences, there’s no denying that there’s an expectation of women in the public eye to maintain a level of accessibility as part of their actual work, engaging in correspondence with their fans and sharing intimate details about their lives. “No decision exists in a vacuum. We’re making that decision for a reason,” McDonald adds, and her co-host concurs. “At some point along the line, I internalised this belief that if I have a platform, I must expose the most traumatic sides of my life to help other people,” says Andrews. “And for some reason I don’t see that being the case for the men around me.” That level of intimacy can be a difficult path to retreat from once you’ve embarked on it. “The more you give, the more people expect from you,” Charrière notes. If you occasionally engage with some of your followers, others feel affronted when you don’t respond to them. If you have demonstrated a willingness to share some personal information publicly, people begin to feel entitled to all of it. Gossip forums such as the notorious Tattle Life are rife with amateur detectives sleuthing often deeply personal information about influencers that’s hard to justify as being in the public interest, as per the website’s stated raison d’être. And yet there is a fear among many creators that publicly commenting on the discomfort of these expectations would risk appearing ungrateful for the audiences that, ultimately, sustain their livelihoods. And perhaps they’re wise to accept these dynamics as merely the cost of doing business, the Faustian pact of creative work wherein audiences’ investment in your personal life often bolsters your professional endeavours. Still, I can’t help but feel a little depressed by that attitude, and the normalisation of trading one’s boundaries for professional success – not to mention the implications for the type of creative work likely to be produced under those circumstances. Personally, I’m still torn over the right amount to share on social media, mindful of how easily parasocial fandom can tip into overfamiliarity, and of my own tendency towards petulance when it does. These days I flit between sharing the ins and outs of my ongoing flat renovation with all 37,000 of my Instagram followers, and with a more limited “Close Friends” only audience (about 50 people who are, I suspect, bored senseless by my prevarication over nearly identical swatches of white paint). While working on this article, I decided to remove the “Hi friends!” greeting I’d reflexively opened with in a newsletter I was drafting, suddenly conscious of slipping into the cadence often employed by people with sizeable followings when communicating with their audiences (or “communities”, as they are often called). For now I’ve settled on the slightly awkward sounding “Hello there” – though I still sign off my newsletter with an “x”. It’s a stab at taking a leaf out of McDonald’s playbook, and her assertion that, ultimately, it’s down to creators to manage the situation themselves. She and Andrews neither check nor respond to their DMs as much as they used to, and in the past year have decided to share less information about their private lives on air. “The responsibility is on us to create our own boundaries,” she concludes. “You can’t expect other people to do that for you.” We Need to Talk About Money by Otegha Uwagba is published by Fourth Estate at £14.99.

2/13/2022,"They are the lifeblood of many communities, but tens of thousands of pubs and breweries across Britain have closed down since the 1970s, with thousands more falling victim to Covid-19 lockdowns and restrictions. Now, leading British film-makers have taken inspiration from the near loss of their own community pubs to produce a feature film that they describe as “a love-letter to family, community, real ale and Britain’s forgotten rural traditions”. Writer-directors Meg Leonard and Nick Moorcroft – who made Fisherman’s Friends, one of the most successful British independent films of the past decade – are about to start shooting the uplifting story, which also explores serious issues, from the dying trade of pubs to mental health.  Titled Mother’s Pride, it is a comedy drama about a failing pub, a divided community and a grieving family whose lives are changed by brewing real ale and entering the Great British beer awards. Moorcroft said: “Pubs are really important for communities, bringing people together, which is especially pertinent with Covid as they tackle loneliness and social isolation. But on our location scouting, we were visiting pubs that have been empty for two years – and will never become pubs again. Each is filled with history and memories. It’s really sad.” Leonard said the losses were “particularly resonant when we’re all lacking human connection” because of Covid: “That’s why our film feels important to make now.” Filming begins in May in a Somerset village pub. James Spring, the film’s producer, said: “Somebody very valiantly tried to run it for a number of years and then, when Covid and lockdown came, that was the moment to call it a day.” Noting that some of the lost pubs had survived for hundreds of years until recently, he added: “With the lockdown, for a business that was tough anyway, that’s been the final nail in the coffin for a lot of them.” The film-makers have experience in their respective communities of pub closures and local people coming together to save those pubs. Leonard recalled her childhood memories of the Shoemakers Arms in the Brecon Beacons national park, an 1800s cottage once occupied by a shoemaker before becoming a tavern, and where she remembers horses tethered outside “to get round drink-driving”. “I grew up in a farming community in the mountains in mid-Wales, very rural and remote. This one pub was very important as a watering hole. There wasn’t anywhere else for people to meet, unless it was chapel. The mental health of the community is serviced by people being able to get together. This was a lifeline. When it was faced with closure, the community clubbed together and bought the pub,” she said. Moorcroft grew up in rural Essex where one of the local pubs was the Compasses, Littley Green, whose future was secured after it was bought back from a pub chain by members of a brewing family who had once owned it. Industry figures vary, but more than 11,000 pubs closed between 2012 and 2021, according to AlixPartners CGA Market Recovery Monitor. Tom Stainer, chief executive of the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), said pubs were crying out for government support and that their loss to communities was “immeasurable”. “A local can increase your number of friends, your wellbeing, your happiness and your mental health. Once a pub closes down, you lose all of that. There are big housing estates that have no communal space at all,” he said. Moorcroft said: “This is an industry under serious threat. The government needs to help them. The film is a call to arms.” The film-makers have an impressive track record. Fisherman’s Friends, based on the true story of singing Cornish fishermen who signed a record deal, had success worldwide and inspired a sequel, Fisherman’s Friends: One and All, to be released in cinemas this year. Their other hits include Finding Your Feet, a romantic comedy that has inspired a French remake. The same film-makers are also about to produce a biopic about Levi Roots, who found fame and fortune after securing an investment for his Reggae Reggae sauce on Dragons’ Den.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"New film is ‘a love letter’ to British pubs, an institution under threat",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/13/new-film-is-a-love-letter-to-british-pubs-an-institution-under-threat
2/13/2022,"A student whose photograph went viral after her arrest at a vigil following the murder of Sarah Everard said she “almost cried” when she heard Dame Cressida Dick had resigned as Metropolitan police commissioner. Patsy Stevenson was pinned to the ground at the vigil on 13 March at Clapham Common, south London, for Everard, who had been kidnapped while walking home before being raped and murdered by the serving Met officer Wayne Couzens.  The force was criticised over its policing of the vigil, during which women were bundled to the ground and arrested for breaching Covid-19 laws. In a Sunday Times interview, published ahead of first anniversary of her arrest, Stevenson, 28, a physics student, said she “stopped in the street and almost cried” when she heard the commissioner had resigned. She said: “I thought, thank God. Not only has she presided over a force where systemic misogyny and racism has been allowed to thrive, she’s failed to ensure the perpetrators are prosecuted. “But the fact that she’s out doesn’t fix what’s going on. This can’t be a token gesture. There has to be top-down, radical change.” Stevenson, who has since launched legal action against the police, said she was forced to the ground, handcuffed and arrested under Covid-19 laws, the same laws Couzens had falsely used to arrest and handcuff Everard as she walked home. She said officers used “brute force” to intimidate her and other women that night, adding she had previously trusted the force and thought police brutality was “rare”. “It felt like they were telling us not to mess with them. I’d always trusted the police, so it was unexpected and shocking,” Stevenson said. “I could never have imagined something like that could happen to me … I was confused and terrified. “All the time I was being handcuffed and taken away I was thinking, this is how Couzens got Sarah into his car. I knew they were going to put me in their van but I didn’t know what they were going to do to me or what they could get away with.” After the photograph of her arrest went viral, she said she experienced abuse on social media, “really, really in-depth death threats and extremely twisted misogyny from men who said they knew where I lived and they were coming to kidnap me. I don’t think I slept for more than an hour all that week”. Stevenson said her Tinder profile was liked by 50 serving Met officers. She said she knew they were serving police officers “because they were in uniform! And their bio says, ‘I’ve got handcuffs and a baton and they’re not the fluffy kind. Wink.’ I mean what are they doing?” she told the newspaper. She said she was continually worried about her own security, had been followed home by random strangers and had to move house. “After the vigil, a very nice decent police officer came round and gave me a barricade for my door and window locks, and I carry a vibrating alarm wherever I go,” she said. She still has a fear of police officers, saying: “I cross the road to avoid them,” and said she had nightmares of being forced to the ground, unable to breathe. “The feeling of being physically overwhelmed as they surrounded me will stay with me for ever,” she said. Stevenson is contesting a £200 fine for breaking Covid laws. Couzens is serving a whole-life order for his crimes, while prosecutors are separately considering charging three of his former colleagues over allegations they shared racist and misogynistic messages with him.",News/UK news,‘I almost cried’: woman arrested at Everard vigil expresses relief after Met chief quits,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/13/i-almost-cried-woman-arrested-at-everard-vigil-expresses-relief-after-met-chief-cressida-dick-quits

2/13/2022,"‘The idea of having a memorial to this catastrophe next to the mother of parliaments,” says Dr Martin Stern, “is brilliant.” He speaks of the Holocaust memorial proposed for Victoria Tower Gardens, next to the Palace of Westminster. He does not, though, feel the same way about a learning centre that is proposed to go with the memorial. He feels that this would be a “calamitous mistake”, both “ridiculously large” for the small park in which it would be located and “ridiculously small” for its intended purpose. Stern’s views should carry some weight. He is a survivor of the Theresienstadt concentration camp, where he was sent at the age of five. In 2018, he was awarded an MBE for his services to Holocaust education. He was an early backer of the memorial idea and was “induced to record a video” in its support before he saw the full extent of the plans. He tells me that “it distresses me greatly to upset people that I respect and like” who support the project. But he feels it is too important an issue to remain silent.  The UK Holocaust Memorial and Learning Centre has been contentious ever since David Cameron announced it in 2016. Objectors have questioned whether it is the most effective way of ensuring that the Holocaust is fully remembered in the future. They have also opposed its unquestionable impact on Victoria Tower Gardens and the threat its excavation poses to magnificent mature plane trees. The security aspect of putting it in the middle of Westminster is, as Stern puts it, “a nightmare. It’s an obvious target for nutcases.” The learning centre magnifies these issues. It has to be buried underground because there is nowhere else for it to go. It requires bag checks and security screenings. It bloats the project into something unwieldy and cumbersome and drives the cost up to a figure that is now more than £100m. Stern points out, as have others, that there is a much better place for such a centre, in the Imperial War Museum, which already has powerful and informative Holocaust galleries about a mile from the memorial site. There is more room there for a learning centre, he says, and it “could integrate with other organisations… it would have more space for expansion”. He would like to see a less grandiose but still eloquent memorial built next to parliament. Last year, the then planning minister Chris Pincher gave the project the go-ahead, after a public inquiry recommended approval, but the question is still not settled. Later this month, the high court will hear an appeal against the government’s decision, brought by the London Historic Parks and Gardens Trust. Stern does not make any claim to speak for all survivors, although he knows many others who feel as he does, but don’t want to speak out. Surely such an endeavour should respect voices such as his wherever possible. The best way to do that would be to place the learning centre in a location where it would flourish. It wouldn’t weaken the project’s ideals and objectives, but would strengthen them.

2/13/2022,"Afew years ago, I was interviewing the French novelist Laurent Binet and asked him what the most powerful motivational force in his creative process was. “A fear of humiliation,” he told me. Writing is a profoundly exposing act, a public baring of the soul, and this is why so many authors hide behind irony or flippancy, unwilling to commit fully to the deepest demands of their art. I thought about Binet, who described an almost paralysing anxiety that people would laugh at his writing, when reading Alex Hyde’s debut novel. This is a book that walks along the dangerous edge between seriousness and portentousness, between high art and parody. That it largely works is down to the very earnestness with which Hyde pursues her artistic ends, the sense of a writer entirely committed to her project. Drawing loosely on the story of Hyde’s own father’s birth and upbringing, Violets tells the story of two young women during the second world war, both of them called Violet. The first Violet we meet wakes in a Birmingham hospital with memories of an “enamel pail of blood”. She has had a hysterectomy after an ectopic pregnancy. Dreams of a happy family life with her husband, Fred, seem suddenly remote. What’s more, he is about to be deployed to Burma.  The other Violet is younger, in a small Welsh village, pregnant by a Polish soldier who’d been lodging with her family. On a whim, she signs up to the Auxiliary Territorial Service, who are “shipping out to Italy pretty quick. Naples”. Hiding her pregnancy, she flees to Italy. This Violet’s chapters are punctuated with passages of poetry addressed to the unborn child – “Pram Boy”. Some of these poems are more successful than others, with the occasional sense that they are there more as a signifier of formal daring than because they work either on their own as poetry or as part of the broader narrative. This is a profoundly unusual novel, an intricately composed and thoroughly corporeal portrait of the intertwined lives of two women during the war. Hyde is clearly a writer of talent and ambition: Violets suggests a glittering career ahead. Violets by Alex Hyde is published by Granta (£12.99).

2/13/2022,"Maria Friedman, 61, is a singer, actor and director who has a natural musicality (her parents were classical musicians) and knows how to get inside a song and make it her own – and ours – with emotional precision. An eight-time Olivier nominee (she has won the prize three times), she is known for her interpretations of Stephen Sondheim’s songbook, and is about to celebrate him and the composers Marvin Hamlisch and Michel Legrand in Legacy, a show at the Menier Chocolate Factory in London. Friedman is married to the actor Adrian Der Gregorian and has two sons. Tell me about the first time you met Stephen Sondheim…I was in my early 20s and in a gala as a replacement for a singer who had flu. I had two days to learn Broadway Baby [from Sondheim’s Follies]. The lyrics fitted me like a glove: it was about a girl with aspirations who wanted to land a great job and not work in cafes or live in a bedsit with no money. Everyone considered Broadway Baby Elaine Stritch’s song [she was also on the bill that night]. The music started and a spotlight went on to the middle of the stage. I took a deep breath and was about to start my song when, from the top of the gods, someone shouted: “Get off, we want Elaine!” I had tears in my eyes but dug really deep into those lyrics. It’s what I have done ever since. Sondheim’s work is extraordinary: when you trust it and live in it, it keeps you safe. The place went berserk. Sondheim was in the audience; at the party afterwards he asked: “Who was that girl?”  What was he like as a character?He came to see me later in Ghetto at the National, and it was after that I got cast as Dot in Sunday in the Park With George. Sondheim was the most curious person I’ve ever met. His intelligence was dazzling, but what I loved most was his capacity to laugh and to care and to listen. So was the nuanced bittersweet quality of his music in evidence in the man himself?Life is bittersweet and his music reflects that. He wrote about people’s complexities and relished them. There was never any judgment about people being fractured. He was a kind, loyal man, but God, he could be very … direct. I gather he was godfather to one of your boys?He was godfather to my son Toby and mentor to my younger son, Alfie. How do you interpret a song –?It’s gradual. You have a smell, a feeling about your connection. You feel it coming closer and closer until it becomes part of your marrow and suddenly it belongs to you. Sondheim’s genius was that he left space for every actor to bring their own life into play – he was open to new interpretations and would roar with laughter when you came up with something he had not thought of. Tell me about your show at the Chocolate Factory, which will celebrate not only Sondheim but the American composer Marvin Hamlisch and French composer Michel Legrand …I worked with them both, and travelled the world with them. I sang at Marvin Hamlisch’s memorial along with Aretha Franklin, Barbra Streisand and Liza Minnelli. Michel Legrand came to see me in one of my shows and actually played the piano, which was unbelievable. I sang at his memorial too. So this is in memory of absent friends?It’s about legacy, celebrating three people I miss. Sondheim had this idea that everything had to stay fresh. And so during the pandemic I got a lot of recently graduated young people to send me tapes and auditioned them, and they’re taking part. This was not out of sympathy but because they are amazing. Your father, Leonard Friedman, a violinist with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, left the family when you were five. How did that influence your life?Look at the men I’ve mentioned: three Jewish older men … we don’t need a psychiatrist to tell us about that [laughs]. I realised something about my dad recently. I hardly knew him but he got me up to the Isle of Mull for one of his festivals. He promised me the world – cellos and violins and everything – but I ended opening my show with small pipes and a banjo, for f’s sake. He was doing a concert down the road. Then, bit by bit, all the musicians came in and began making music, and that was the show that ended up at the Donmar because Caro Newling, who is Sam Mendes’s producing partner, was on a walking trip with her mother and came to see my little cabaret. I got my first Olivier award for that show. And that was because of my dad. Your sister is the leading West End producer Sonia Friedman. What do your other siblings do?My brother is a solo violinist and was leader of the Royal Ballet… he’s amazing. Sarah is a computer scientist and way, way cleverer than all of us. And wonderful Benjy was the director/producer of Bake Off and is now a documentary-maker. When you look back on your life, which has played the bigger part – luck or hard work?Not knowing the rules meant we walked into situations that somebody with more education and a conventional upbringing might not have walked into. The lack of formality in our family meant we were either going to drown or just scrabble to stay afloat. I’ve spent months of my life under water with a little snorkel, just managing. But in terms of luck, I feel blessed that music has been part of my life. I’ve worked hard at it but I love what I do so it doesn’t feel like work. Getting cancer in 2005 was obviously bad luck. How has that changed your perception of your life?A lot of people say cancer has made them bolder but it made me more afraid. I gave up the industry – nobody believed I would – and did concerts and jobs that were not going to take me away from putting my children to bed. I was 45. There are big consequences if you step out of the industry, but I didn’t have a choice. It was the right decision, yet part of me got lost. It’s good now because I’m coming back. How old are your sons, and does being a mother get easier as time goes by?Toby is 27 and has a degree in inclusive performance. He works with an autistic child at Chickenshed [theatre company]. My other son, Alfie, is 19 and a brilliant actor and has just got a great part in Peter Kosminsky’s new TV series The Undeclared War with Mark Rylance and Simon Pegg. As for being a mother … it does not get easier as time goes by! What Sondheim song would you choose to get you through the hardest times?Move On from Sunday in the Park With George – “Stop worrying where you are going … The choice may have been mistaken, the choosing was not. You have to move on.” It’s about taking one little step forward. Life changes and things pass. You can’t stand still. What’s the happiest song you sing?The Way You Look Tonight [by Jerome Kern]. It’s about capturing the moment when you know you’ll love somebody for ever and will grow old with them if you’re lucky. I used to sing that to my little grandma and know she was transported to when she was young dancing with her handsome husband. She was 96 and she was beautiful. I love that song.

2/13/2022,"This Is Going to Hurt BBC One | iPlayerChloe (BBC One) | iPlayerInventing Anna NetflixStarstruck (BBC One) | iPlayer If you’re expecting a baby, then perhaps it’s best to give the new seven-part BBC One drama This Is Going to Hurt a swerve and watch something more chilled with less gore: say, the Red Wedding massacre on Game of Thrones?  Adapted by doctor turned writer Adam Kay from his bestselling 2017 memoir of the same name, and directed by Lucy Forbes (In My Skin), TIGTH is like a medically sanctioned slasher movie. The opening scene involves obstetrics and gynaecology (“brats and twats”) acting registrar Adam (Ben Whishaw), fresh from sleeping in his car, encountering a woman whose unborn baby’s arm hangs out of her like a bloodied spindle. As the series unfolds (all episodes are on iPlayer), blood, guts and placentas are chucked around by the bucketful; trainees faint into caesarean incisions; foetal heartbeats vanish; vulvas are mutilated. As you’d expect, the carnage comes with socio-political undertones, showing the underfunded, overstretched NHS as broken. Medics lurch through drab corridors like zombie extras in The Walking Dead. Patients are sometimes stupid or racist. Nor are the staff presented, glowingly, reductively, as saints and angels. For his part, Adam is human, fallible and not that nice with it. He makes a terrible mistake and scrabbles to cover it up. Treated like a serf by his consultant (Alex Jennings), he’s correspondingly mean and sarcastic (“So near, and yet so shit”) to his nervous underling, played by Ambika Mod. Meanwhile, Adam’s personal life with fiance (Rory Fleck Byrne) is in tatters. A colleague wryly observes: “You should mention the gay thing at work. People might warm to you more.” The result is graphically reminiscent of Jed Mercurio’s Bodies, but this time from the perspective of an unintentional bad guy who also does good… it’s complicated. The tone chops so violently between light and shade that sometimes it forgets to take the viewer with it, but Whishaw effectively embodies the bloodshot-eyed desperation of a macho-hours work culture where every slip can mean life or death. If the medical profession is rife with impostor syndrome, then Chloe, the six-part BBC One thriller created, written and directed by Alice Seabright (Sex Education), is about embracing the fraud within in a social media-addled world where the heavily curated onscreen life is king. Erin Doherty (Princess Anne in The Crown) stars as Becky, first spied obsessively scrolling though the Instagram-feed of Chloe (Poppy Gilbert). Chloe’s perfect existence (big house, perfect marriage, yoga, blah, blah) appears to mock Becky’s reality: an office temp living with a dementia-stricken mother. When Chloe dies, Becky restyles herself as art-world somebody Sasha, and infiltrates Chloe’s social group, including her best friend (Pippa Bennett-Warner) and husband (Billy Howle). What is Becky up to, and what was her relationship with Chloe? Doherty gives a beautifully ambiguous performance in which it’s difficult to work out whether Becky is malignant or just messy. Her eyes shine coldly, victoriously, as she successfully navigates her new clique: an arty, voluminous dress here, a carefully calibrated accent there, laid-back entitlement everywhere. The real Becky keeps escaping through the cracks (hate, envy, need), but there’s honesty there too. She knows she’s a construct – a talentless Ms Ripley – but it’s still better than who and what she really is. I loved all this, I sucked it up like a superfood smoothie. But sadly, a few episodes in (again, the whole series is on iPlayer), Chloe turns sludgy and formulaic, with a denouement that’s as unlikely as it is overexplained. While still watchable, it wasn’t a patch on the earlier episodes, in which Chloe is a study of social climbing mores in the modern era, with mischievous flashes of Patricia Highsmith. Doherty is superb, barely needing to speak: her intense, hyper-vigilant face says it all. Another delicious impostor of the social media age arrives in the latest Shonda Rhimes offering, Netflix’s nine-part Inventing Anna, part-directed by David Frankel (The Devil Wears Prada) and based on a 2018 New York magazine article, How Anna Delvey Tricked New York’s Party People, by Jessica Pressler. Julia Garner stars as Delvey, real name Anna Sorokin, who posed as a fake German heiress, managing to dupe Big Apple high society, and (almost) the banking world into financing her multimillion-dollar schemes, including a Park Avenue social club. In real life, Sorokin was jailed for her crimes (after her release, she was detained again for overstaying her visa). I was expecting an examination of upmarket grifting on a major scale, but unfortunately Inventing Anna is a padded-out mess. Despite being swamped by her wigs, Garner is suitably fierce and commanding as Delvey – demanding private jets; denouncing people as “basic” – but after a while, her narcissistic shtick (“My father will wire over the money”) becomes droningly repetitive. Moreover, Delvey’s relationship with the journalist Vivian (Anna Chlumsky), presumably representing Pressler, is overplayed, as are the relentless sequences following journalistic process – we practically end up writing the piece with Vivian (I know we journalists are dead sexy and all, but Watergate this ain’t). Inventing Anna would have worked far better if it had focused on the flawed but mesmeric hot mess of Delvey, rather than on getting the story about Delvey. I was shocked to find myself bored and wondering if other viewers would last until the end. The first series of the UK-based millennial romcom-sitcom Starstruck was an unexpected hit last year. Created and co-written by the New Zealander comedian Rose Matafeo, it followed her character, Jessie, as she blundered into a relationship with famous actor Tom (Nikesh Patel). The six-part second series begins with Jessie not returning to New Zealand after all, and she and Tom continuing their adventures in odd coupledom. The script remains baggy, with Matafeo’s charisma doing some heavy lifting. Still, it’s a warm, easy watch. Minnie Driver reprises her role as Tom’s self-serving agent (“I recognise you from Instagram. You realise anyone can see that?”), and I’m sure we’d all love – love – to know who Russell Tovey based his obnoxious, laddish film director on. While Starstruck makes obvious nods to Notting Hill, the vibe remains zones 4-6, and it’s all the better for it. Imagine… Marian Keyes: My (Not So) Perfect Life(BBC One)Alan Yentob’s art series profiles the bestselling Irish writer Marian Keyes. She talks candidly about alcohol addiction, depression and the blatant chauvinism directed at “chick lit”. Direct, engaging, whip-smart, Keyes never disappoints. Love Is Blind(Netflix)It’s back – the second series of the hit dating show where couples meet in the dark and are then astounded to discover they might not have much in common after all. Preposterous it may be, but it’s also addictive. 60 Days With the Gypsies(Channel 4)In the raw, sometimes alarming opener of this documentary series, explorer Ed Stafford experiences the ups and downs of life with Romany Gypsies and Irish Travellers, with outsider distrust and evictions constantly forcing them to move on.",Arts/Television & radio,The week in TV: This Is Going to Hurt; Chloe; Inventing Anna; Starstruck,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/13/this-is-going-to-hurt-review-adam-kay-ben-whishaw-chloe-erin-doherty-inventing-anna-starstruck-2
2/13/2022,"Asking my friends for parenting advice is tough, because we all know next to nothing, but good because we do at least agree what we’re doing is very hard and we should be proud of ourselves. My dad, by contrast, is the exact opposite. He doesn’t really dispense parenting advice, even though he had 11 children and fostered half a dozen more. He’s basically the end-level boss of dads, the one you have to fight once you’ve dispatched Tom Hanks, Richard Madeley and Liam Neeson’s character from Taken. There’s nothing I’ve done as much, or for as long, as he’s done parenting, but when I ask him specific questions, he always seems slightly bemused I’m having any trouble at all, as if I’ve rung him up for a refresher course on tying my shoelaces.  ‘Just do what you think is best,’ he said on the phone a few days ago, when I related my trepidation around introducing the imminent baby to our son. He uttered this with the sort of breezy dismissal that suggested he’d feel more panicked sliding some keys off one fob and on to a different fob. Maybe deep investment in the small anxieties of fatherhood is just one of the first casualties of having so many children. What can trepidation really mean to someone who’s sat through more than 100 school plays? What could perturb a man who has been witness to the gory loss of 220 baby teeth – and had to shell out cold, hard cash for each? My fears about welcoming another child into our family fell on deaf ears, not because my dad is unfeeling, but because he has introduced a new baby to an older sibling no less than 55 times, and can’t remember it ever being much of a problem. My friends and I spend parenting chats nodding our frowning heads sympathetically, riveted by the noble difficulties of our challenging lives, and the fresh offering of new hurdles that come with every milestone. Not so my dad, who had seven kids under 10 by the time he was my age, and spent a period between 1999 and 2000 living with six teenage daughters at once – an experience which resulted in his capacity for anxiety being permanently cauterised. ‘Should I get him a wee present from the baby?’ I ask, hoping this leading question will force some specific advice from him in a pathetic act of ventriloquism. ‘Maybe,’ he says, ‘but then you’d better be ready for them to want a present from the baby every time they see them, so prepare for that!’ The financial sting of all those baby teeth clearly made its mark, I think to myself. My dad is, of course, merely a proponent of the theory that parents know better than they think they do, and experience has taught him that worrying about every little thing is useless. By the end of the call, I know it’s the best advice I could receive, precisely because it fails to flatter my problems the way I tend to prefer. Luckily, I relate his responses to some friends the following day, along with my frustration at being told everything will be fine. ‘That’s so hard,’ they say, and we frown, happily, once again.
