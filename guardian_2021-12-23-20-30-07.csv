12/23/2021,"On Sunday, Senator Joe Manchin finally said the word that many have expected from him for a long time: “no”. After a year of mammoth negotiations over the Biden administration’s social welfare and climate legislation, called Build Back Better, the senator from West Virginia told Fox News that it was time to stop trying and move on. At the same time, he released a statement blaming inflation, the national debt and Covid-19 – in other words, anything but himself – for the failure to reach a deal. The White House was reported to be “blindsided” by the news. But progressives have long seen this moment coming. All year long progressives in Congress have been negotiating with moderates like Manchin over the Biden administration’s legislative priorities. They agreed to support an infrastructure bill which the moderates badly wanted (and which was, to be fair, a good piece of legislation) in exchange for assurances that Build Back Better would also pass Congress. They stuck by this deal through thick and thin, even when Manchin insisted on defanging many of its climate provisions. They didn’t even balk when asked to drop their demand that both pieces of legislation pass Congress at the same time, which would have prevented Manchin from shirking on the agreement later.  In return, progressives got screwed – badly. For all the talk over the last few years of the emergence of a “tea party of the left” or moderate hair-rending over the social media antics of “the Squad”, progressives in Congress approached these negotiations constructively, reasonably, and in good faith. They put aside their concerns about Joe Biden and gave him the wins he wanted on centrist priorities, even when that meant delaying action on their own. And they did this even though the evidence is that the main components of the Build Back Better agenda are overwhelmingly popular with the public at large and might even help to save an administration which the public sees as badly adrift. This outcome is devastating for the future of trust and cooperation within the Democratic party. Progressives can hardly be expected to continue to subordinate their own goals to those of the moderate wing in the future or trust moderate leaders to work towards progressive goals. There’s not likely to ever be a “tea party of the left”, but progressives can be expected to start exerting themselves much more vigorously through public debate, legislative negotiation and launching primary challengers against the centrists who thwart their agenda. Progressives are also likely to be emboldened because Manchin’s betrayal provides additional validation for two important components of their critique of the Democratic party. The first is that the party has been too willing to put corporate interests above tackling social welfare and climate change. Manchin not only represents the coal state of West Virginia but also profits handsomely from the industry personally. This consideration can hardly have been far from his mind when he forced the removal from the Build Back Bill of a provision which would have done more than anything to force energy companies to phase out fossil fuels. With the future of the planet at stake and figures like Manchin blocking the party from doing anything about it, progressives can only conclude that the party itself needs transforming. The second progressive critique which has been vindicated by this turn of events is the charge that the Democratic party’s leadership is too complacent and chummy – some might also add old – to face up to the challenges facing America today. Throughout this year, Biden has barely lifted a finger in public to shepherd Build Back Better through Congress. If activists used to worry about the deals that got done behind closed doors in smoke-filled rooms, then 2021 was the year of the smoke-filled Zoom: a hazy interminable conversation between the president and Manchin which never seemed to yield any concrete results, but which did just enough to keep Biden quiet in public. If the president had seen himself as more of a crusader for progressive goals than a former senator still working the room, there’s no guarantee the outcome would have been different. But one thing is for sure: the approach he did take failed. Trust takes years to build and only a single act to destroy. And unfortunately, there’s no time now to rebuild it, because Manchin’s blow comes as Democrats have only a short time to pass major legislation before campaigning begins for the midterms. This could meanlosing out not only on salvaging some parts of Build Back Better, but also on crucial action on safeguarding voting rights. And without any significant new accomplishments, the party faces dim prospects in 2022 and 2024. As imperfect a vehicle for progressive hopes as it is, the Biden presidency may be the last in a long time with both the desire and the capabilities to tackle social inequality, hold back the rise of the oceans, and safeguard American democracy. Manchin and his enablers may have just killed it. Progressives will never forgive, and they will never forget.

12/23/2021,"When it comes to the surging Omicron variant of Covid, just about all I’m hearing is advice about holiday planning. Should one attend a holiday party? Travel? Meet friends at a restaurant? Much of the answer boils down to how to calculate one’s tolerance for risk when so little is known about Omicron except that it spreads easily. Experts are throwing around a lot of numbers. Columnists are sharing their own personal calculations.  I understand. We’re all a bit spooked and don’t know exactly what to do. Calculations offer a degree of reassuring certitude. But why does America need to turn this latest Covid surge — as we do so much else — into a question of individual risk, personal calculation, and self-concerned choice? Personal responsibility is important, of course. But I worry that this hubbub over individual risk assessment is distracting us from what we need to do now as a society to be readier for Omicron than we were for Delta or for the first Covid surge. It also plays directly into the hands of anti-vaxxers who want to believe Covid is only about personal choice. On Friday’s Fox Business, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis was asked if he was getting the booster. DeSantis smirked, shook his head no, and then went into a long harangue about why people should make vaccine decisions “for themselves.” This past weekend, at Turning Point USA, the Maga college Republican spin-off (whose founder died from Covid-19 last summer), Sarah Palin said it would be “over my dead body” that she got vaccinated (no pun intended). And Tucker Carlson (perhaps the most harmful person in America these days) railed against those who are urging vaccination, saying they just want to “punish people.” Carlson then praised the “naturally immune” who “earned it.” It’s too easy for the rest of us to respond to this rubbish by telling ourselves that anti-vaxxers will pay the price because they’re putting themselves at much higher risk of being hospitalized and even dying. But this kind of thinking reflects the same dangerous fallacy — that each of us must make such life-or-death decisions solely for themselves. On Friday, Jeff Zients, the White House Covid coordinator, inadvertently promoted this fallacy by telling reporters that while the administration will work to minimize Omicron disruption for the vaccinated, the unvaccinated should expect “a winter of severe illness and death for yourselves, your families....” In reality, all of us are in this together. And so far, all of us together are failing. America’s rate of deaths from Covid is the highest of all advanced nations. Fewer than 62 percent of us are fully vaccinated — the lowest of all advanced nations. Those who continue to refuse to get vaccinated are endangering the rest of us — and not just because they’re increasing the risk of a “breakthrough” infection in those of us who have been fully vaccinated. As Omicron surges, the unvaccinated are likely to overwhelm hospitals throughout the land, making it harder for our entire health system to respond to all health needs and emergencies. The unvaccinated are also incubators for the next variant. Anti-vaxxers aside, the emphasis on individual risk is allowing us to forget the social needs that became exposed when the pandemic first hit in early 2020 — most of which are still unmet. America is still doing almost no contact tracing compared to other advanced nations. Rapid Covid tests are still difficult to find, and too expensive. (The free tests that the Biden administration is touting won’t be available until next month.) N95 masks are still in short supply. There’s still little or no coordination among different levels of government. Biden’s order that large businesses require employees to be vaccinated remains stuck in the federal courts. Hospitals in many places still don’t have enough Intensive Care Units. We could once again face a shortage of ventilators. Too many workplaces are still unsafe. They’re still not required to test employees and report all Covid infections. They still don’t have to provide personal protective equipment. Workers still can’t stay home for fear of getting the Omicron variant at work because we still don’t have a national system of paid leave (thanks to Joe Manchin and senate Republicans). They can’t quit their jobs because extended unemployment insurance has run out. America still isn’t taking the lead in getting vaccines to poor nations around the world, thereby allowing more variants to emerge. I’m unable to advise you about whether you should attend that holiday party or cancel your travel plans. But I can assure you that what we’re facing is not just a matter of personal choice or individual risk tolerance. We’re facing another test of America’s capacity to respond to a public-health crisis. And the safety of every one of us depends on the nation doing better this time than we did before.

12/23/2021,"On Wednesday, the New York Times – and others – published what appeared to be good news. “Omicron infections seem to be milder, three research teams report” read the headline. Many readers must have been relieved to see this news, especially with cases sky-rocketing even as the holiday season is in full swing. As someone living with post-viral conditions exacerbated by Long Covid, I read the story carefully. I noted the preliminary nature of the data from South Africa, Scotland and England, and the prediction that the greater infectiousness of Omicron would still likely land many people in hospitals already strained to capacity.  But despite these caveats, I felt little relief or reassurance after reading the article. It contained no mention at all of Long Covid. Not one. This is not a benign oversight; it’s a fundamental and dangerous misread of our global predicament and the future that awaits us. We’ve still got a lot to learn about Covid-19, including this new variant. But one thing we know for certain is that “mild Covid” can be debilitating and lead to long-term or permanent disease and disability. We now know that at least 10-30% of those who survive any Covid infection (from asymptomatic or “mild”to severe) will go on to live with (and sometimes die from) long Covid – a long-term, lifelong, or even life-threatening or fatal, disabling chronic syndrome, the biological pathways of which are still largely unknown. Even before Omicron, the CDC estimates there have been at least 146.6m Covid infections in the United States alone – meaning at least 15 million people are estimated to have long Covid. And now, many formerly healthy people who now have long Covid face the Omicron wave made more vulnerable by conditions known to greatly increase risk of severe or fatal Covid – including long Covid-associated diabetes, strokes and lung disease. As Omicron entered the news in November, early reports from South Africa noted that many cases were mild. In some ways, this was utterly predictable – the nation has a relatively young population, and more severe disease often takes several weeks to develop. But the rapid dissemination of this speculation was not politically neutral. And the potential consequences are not mild at all. The “mild” theme was quickly picked up by leaders who have vowed to never repeat the lockdowns and other restrictions of previous waves. A faster-spreading strain in the lead-up to a holiday travel season in many areas of the world would have drastic economic implications.It also was an opportunity for dog whistles on “herd immunity”, the bot-fueled and misguided notion embraced by some of the same forces promoting climate science denial: that preventing Covid-19 spread would become unnecessary or even harmful by delaying natural immunity or the evolution of a truly globally insignificant dominant strain. But Omicron, less resistant to vaccines and natural immunity, is driving a huge global wave of infection. Thus, even if there’s a higher percentage of mild cases, we expect a terrible toll in mortality and strained health systems. One individual infection can rapidly spiral into a multi-generational tragedy, multiplied on a world scale. Any one young person’s mild infection this Christmas could rapidly become their grandparent’s demise. And few reports on Omicron even mentioned long Covid as a concern. If we were in the early, terrifying days of 2020, perhaps we could forgive the beleaguered general public and frazzled world leaders for not also referencing long Covid as a terrible consequence of a Covid surge. After all, those of us living with post-viral conditions – such as ME/CFS, dysautonomia, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (Pots) – are used to being ignored, disbelieved, or misadvised. We were on few radars before Covid; even now, the National Institutes of Health (NIH)‘s Recover Initiative on Long Covid has all but ignored post-viral researchers and sidelined patient advocates. But it’s been abundantly clear for more than a year that even asymptomatic infection brings a significant risk of long Covid – a wide spectrum of more than 200 symptoms and conditions that can appear months after initial infection or apparent recovery, and leave children, adults and elders disabled, chronically ill and desperate for medical care, income, housing or even recognition that their suffering is from real physical conditions. On 15 December, South Africa’s Dr Salim Abdool Karim, who co-authored Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant: a new chapter in the COVID-19 pandemic in the Lancet, told a global Zoom audience: “I have no idea what’s in store for us as far as long Covid is concerned … It’s a really important question, and it’s particularly so because Omicron is spreading so fast and so widely so quickly – the number of people getting infected is so big that … if it’s a common consequence of even mild infection, you can imagine, even if in 10% of people, there’s going to be a lot of people with long Covid. It’s certainly something we want to keep a beady eye out on.” As comrades in a terrible journey, people with post-viral conditions have shared all we have learned with people with long Covid – like the importance of resting and pacing instead of pushing through ME/CFS fatigue, and the jarring reality that ME/CFS has the lowest amount of NIH research funding relative to the burden of disease in the population. We now shudder to think that more will be joining our ranks. There is nothing mild about the massive wave of loss and suffering washing over our world. As a global community, we parrot phrases such as “the majority of cases are mild” at our peril. We’ve already lost too many lives from the false hope that Covid-19 will become more mild or subside. We’ve gone months without significant investments in indoor ventilation, distribution of effective masks and global vaccine access. We need sustained systems of benefits, housing security and basic income support for avoiding Covid infection or dealing with post-viral illness. It’s time to choose our words, and our policies, much more carefully. Let it begin by including analysis of long Covid and post-viral illness in any reporting, speculation or policies, starting with this Omicron wave.

12/23/2021,"Ghost pingos, unique ponds forged by the ice age and buried during the era of industrial agriculture, are to be excavated to revive wildlife on two former farms. Rare species including the scarce emerald damselfly and the northern pool frog are set to return to the pingos, which are being restored on farmland next to Thompson Common near Thetford in Norfolk, a little-known nature reserve whose 400 ancient ponds make it the pingo capital of Britain.  The first of 26 ghost pingos on Watering Farm is being excavated by Norfolk Wildlife Trust, a painstaking process which requires soil to be removed an inch at a time under expert supervision. The restorers hope to precisely locate the former bottom of the pond to open up the still-viable seed bank that remains from when the ponds were filled in by a desire to “improve” farmland over the last 150 years. “This is restoration from within,” said Jonathan Preston of Norfolk Wildlife Trust. “You can dig a pond anywhere but the unique thing with these is getting down to that original sediment which will unlock an ancient seed bank.” “Pingo” is an Inuit word for hill, and the ponds were the result of springs forming subterranean ice pinnacles during the last ice age. When these melted, hundreds of small round ponds were created. The pingos’ excavation will be overseen by experts led by Prof Carl Sayer of University College London, who has spearheaded the Norfolk Ponds Project, which has restored 250 lost ponds across the region. Sayer said: “We know from our research that often quite rare plants can be preserved. Can we bring back things that are lost even from Thompson Common? We’re disturbing sediment from a time when there were no sprays, no fertilisers and much wilder places, so plants can come back and say hello.” Once the original shape of the pond is excavated, the depressions will fill up naturally with an upwelling of water from the aquifer, releasing naturally filtered and nutrient-poor water in which sensitive aquatic plants and invertebrates such as diving beetles can flourish. Initial tests by Sayer’s team have identified the dark layers of ancient pond sediment and seeds within it on the 60 acres of Watering Farm. Norfolk Wildlife Trust is also planning to resurrect up to 40 ghost pingos it has identified on 130-acre Mere Farm, which it acquired after a fundraising appeal to expand the unique landscape of Thomson Common. The ghost ponds are first detected using old maps and aerial “lidar” laser scanning which reveals the ponds in hi-tech 3D maps. This joining up and restoration of wetland habitats is crucial for the prospects of rare species such as the northern pool frog, which was reintroduced in Thompson Common in 2005. The native frog, which became extinct in Britain in the 1990s, is doing well, but requires a network of warm pools with surrounding vegetation in which to thrive. Crucial to the success of resurrecting the ghost pingos is to remove subterranean drains that were installed in the 1970s when the land was intensively farmed. Traditional Breckland grassland will be revived around the pingos as a species-rich mosaic of glades, scrub and larger trees is allowed to develop. One of Sayer’s previous restorations brought to the rediscovery of grass-poly, a delicate pink wildflower that is one of Britain’s rarest plants and had been lost to Norfolk for a century. He said that some seeds in ancient sediments could possibly remain viable for hundreds of years. Sayer predicted that the ghost pingos would be brimming with life by this time next year. “When you restore ponds and go back there, sometimes it’s just gobsmacking. It’s almost the most successful form of restoration we know of in Britain – you create systems that are flourishing, alive and very quickly working again.”",News/Environment,Buried ponds to be excavated in Norfolk to revive wildlife,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/23/buried-ponds-to-be-excavated-in-norfolk-to-revive-wildlife
12/23/2021,"Chile always gave the lie to the cold war claim that the United States stood for democracy. When its voters in 1970 showed the temerity (“irresponsibility”, Henry Kissinger called it) to elect socialist Salvador Allende as president, Washington helped orchestrate the coup that toppled him, and backed the resulting dictatorship. It seems those “irresponsible” Chilean voters are at it again – on Sunday, they elected leftist Gabriel Boric as president by a 12-point margin, on the back of a campaign for a new constitution. But if Chilean democracy seems on the road to recovery from its Washington-backed disfiguration, prospects for democracy in the United States look rather bleak.  Sunday also saw Joe Manchin brandish the veto power the US system grants a senator representing fewer than 300,000 voters to tank the agenda of a president chosen by 80 million. And that was but the latest reminder that Americans are not governed by the democratic will of the citizenry. The US supreme court looks ready to strike down abortion rights supported by about two-thirds of the electorate, while Democrats in office seem unable or unwilling to deliver on basic social programs supported by a majority of voters, whether on drug prices or childcare or public health, and much more – or to prevent Republicans brazenly reengineering state-level laws and procedures to prevent voters of color from ever again making the difference they made in 2020. Minority rule is a feature, not a bug of the US constitutional system. Donald Trump was legitimately elected president in 2016 despite losing by 3m votes. And 6 January notwithstanding, the Republican party needs no coup to lock itself into power for the foreseeable future, even if it represents a diminishing minority of voters. The US constitution provides all the tools they’ll need: the electoral college; the US Senate (two seats per state means it can be controlled with less than 20% of the national vote); the supreme court the Senate effectively picks; and the state houses empowered to set voting laws and rules, and even redraw districts to partisan advantage. The framers of the constitution never intended that every American would have a vote, much less a vote of equal value. They created a system to regulate a society ruled by and for wealthy white male settlers engaged in the conquest and subordination of the country’s Indigenous and Black populations. Decades of bitter struggle on the streets have won Black and Brown people far more access to the US political system than the founders ever intended. Still, even the gains codified in the civil rights era are being consciously rolled back by a billionaire-funded white nationalist party looking to cement its hold on power for the foreseeable future against any demographic headwinds. Ineffectual appeals to “save our democracy” reflect the paralysis of mainstream Democrats in the face of the Republican offensive that has weaponized a minority-rule constitutional system. Nor is a majority of citizens easily able, within its rules, to change these anti-democratic provisions of the US constitution: even minor changes require agreement by two-thirds of each house of Congress, and three-quarters of the 50 states. Democratizing the United States – creating a system of government shaped by every citizen having the right to a vote of equal value – would require a different constitution, democratically adopted by a national community quite different from the one imagined by the founding fathers. But that’s what Chileans are attempting. Boric is a product of a student rebellion a decade ago that fed into a broader social justice movement focused on issues ranging from austerity, a failing social safety net, healthcare and economic inequality to gender violence and Indigenous rights. While even center-left governments were stymied from delivering on voter expectations, many in this parliament of the streets recognized that their grievances were products of the democracy deficit built into the dictatorship’s 1980 constitution to ensure continuity of its economic model. Although it allowed Chileans to elect their president and lower house of parliament, that constitution built in minority vetoes, such as appointing one-third of senators and much of the judiciary, as failsafe mechanisms to prevent democratically elected politicians from enacting the systemic changes demanded by voters. Thus the emergence of a democracy movement based outside formal political parties, which in late 2019 won a referendum to have a new constitution democratically drafted. That movement’s energy also propelled Boric to power. So, does Chile have lessons to teach US progressives? It’s a question worth investigating. Sure, the US is nowhere near a point where public opinion recognizes the need for a new constitution. But it’s equally clear that the US fails as a democracy – and the morbid implications of US minority-rule-with-a-democratic-face can’t credibly be avoided. Curiously enough, US conservatives have never been shy to follow Chilean examples: the shrink-government campaign that began in the Reagan era was road-tested by Chile’s dictatorship under the tutelage of US “free-market” ideologues. And President GW Bush, in his 2005 effort to privatize social security, cited Chile as the model to emulate. But the Chilean popular rebellion against that same neoliberal model, and the potential it has raised for a democratic reordering of power and of that country’s social contract, suggests that the right are not the only Americans who may have something to learn from Chile.

12/23/2021,"England have named a 16-player squad for their T20 matches in West Indies next month, with Eoin Morgan leading a group containing 11 players who reached the T20 World Cup semis in November.  With Chris Silverwood on Ashes duty, Paul Collingwood will coach the team in the five-match series to be played in Barbados from January 22-30. Marcus Trescothick, Collingwood’s former England batting partner, will join the squad as assistant coach. Two previously uncapped players in Gloucestershire seamer David Payne and Sussex’s George Garton, both left-arm seamers. Garton was called up for England’s one-day squad to face India in the summer but took no part in play. Phil Salt, who made his England debut last summer in the ODI series with Pakistan, could also make his T20 bow. Despite the absence of T20 regulars Jos Buttler, Jonny Bairstow and Dawid Malan, all playing out in Australia at the Ashes, the squad still leans heavily on the players who lost to New Zealand in the World Cup semis in the UAE. The next T20 World Cup takes place in Australia next October, and Morgan has hinted it may be his last assignment as England’s white-ball captain. Dawid Malan believes England can reignite their Ashes campaign by tapping into the mindset that has driven their success in white-ball cricket. When the sides met in the T20 World Cup just a few weeks before the Ashes, England romped home by eight wickets with 50 balls unused as Jos Buttler clubbed a century against a familiar looking bowling attack comprising Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc. The fearlessly aggressive methods that have transformed England into a gold standard limited-overs operation in cricket under Eoin Morgan - they are world champions in ODIs and world number ones in T20s - can hardly be transported into the five-day format, but Malan feels there are useful lessons about how to confront their rivals. ""The boys are hurting after our performances in the last two games. They realise we haven't been good enough across all facets of the game,"" he said. ""Speaking to all the guys everyone is up for the challenge, everyone is really keen to face up to the Australians. We do it in white-ball cricket, we take them on and there's a lot of the white-ball players in this group as well. ""Hopefully we can get that mindset and not just go into our shells trying to survive but actually try and take the game to them. The boys want to win the series still. I know it's a long way to come but we have to do well and play our best cricket to get ourselves back in the series."" “We have selected a strong squad with some serious batting power and a balanced attack as we begin preparations ahead of the T20 World Cup in Australia,” said Collingwood. ‘The next World Cup is less than a year away and there will be increased opportunities for the squad in the absence of those players who are with the Ashes squad. “I have good memories winning a World Cup in Barbados and I’m really looking forward to going back there with this squad to face a very good West Indies who will test all aspects of our skills.” Eoin Morgan (Middlesex – captain), Moeen Ali (Worcestershire), Tom Banton (Somerset), Sam Billings (Kent), Liam Dawson (Hampshire), George Garton (Sussex), Chris Jordan (Surrey), Liam Livingstone (Lancashire), Saqib Mahmood (Lancashire), Tymal Mills (Sussex), David Payne (Gloucestershire), Adil Rashid (Yorkshire), Jason Roy (Surrey), Phil Salt (Lancashire), Reece Topley (Surrey), James Vince (Hampshire).",Sport/Sport,Bowlers Payne and Garton named in England T20 squad to face West Indies,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/23/bowlers-payne-garton-named-in-england-t20-cricket-to-face-west-indies
12/23/2021,"‘Everyone’s done brilliant, not just me.” I’m chatting to Lucy, an artist with Project Art Works, about the Hastings-based collective’s Turner prize nomination (they lost out to Belfast’s Array Collective in the end). Today she’s in the character of Listey Cat; Lucy’s work revolves around her love of animals, which often manifests in the form of the bright, elaborate costumes she makes and has worn to give gallery tours. “It’s given us more independence and we get to work with other artists,” she says, of the collective. “I feel lucky and chill. It’s therapeutic.”Founded in 1996, Project Art Works collaborates with neurodiverse artists and those with complex support needs, providing them with studio space, materials and facilitators. Tom, who works with lead artist Lucy, is like many of the facilitators also an artist, and is keen to stress the collaborative nature of the practice: “It’s a mutual experience,” he says. “I support Lucy and she supports me.” Neurodiversity has become something of a buzzword in recent years. It’s about replacing the stigmatisation of people with conditions such as autism with the recognition that these are simply normal variations, with qualities of their own. The Turner nomination suggests that the art world finally seems to be catching on. Though perhaps not fast enough, if some of the attitudes Project Art Works CEO and artist director Kate Adams has encountered are anything to go by: “It was only about six years ago that a head of exhibition somewhere within an organisation said to us, ‘I don’t think it’s right [to have] people with learning disabilities in an exhibition downstairs with an artist of calibre upstairs. They shouldn’t be in the same building.’”  Such attitudes have been infuriatingly commonplace. Adams co-founded Project Art Works with fellow artist Jonathan Cole after attending neurodiverse classrooms with her son, who has complex needs, and noting the high standard of the work. Special schools were “these fantastic anarchic little kingdoms”, Adams tells me, producing talented artists the art world was oblivious to, and who lacked practical support. She set out with two goals in mind: to help create connections with individuals who are sometimes hard to reach, and to change perceptions though showing the work they were making. “It’s really important within an exhibition to curate a gradual insight in where the work comes from,” she says. “That tends to have a really good impact on people, because they’re seduced by these incredible artworks, many of which are extraordinary, abstract, spirited images. And then there’s a sort of deeper insight into how they were made and who they were made by.” Audiences, perhaps being less hung up on an artist’s background or identity, have always responded well. But it isn’t the audiences who are the problem. Project Art Works have spent years trying to open up institutions using the methodology they established, and for which they received Arts Council funding in 2017. Some, like MK Gallery in Milton Keynes, have been very receptive, but it hasn’t always been easy. “It’s been really hard to open up the cultural sector,” Adams says. “It is incredibly conservative, especially contemporary visual arts because it’s so aligned with theory, commerce and ego,” she says. Adams believes that they have benefited from what she calls “an existential crisis in the cultural sector about what it’s for. Covid has propelled that. And I think that’s one of the reasons why the Turner prize this year is artists’ collectives.” When they got the nomination, however, they still had to brace themselves. How has it been? “Interesting,” is the response. Some of the coverage has been patronising and dismissive, putting Project Art Works in a box marked “charity” and invoking a word that we both confess to hating: “worthy”. “That is a big put-down. It’s also a way of putting us in a box that says this isn’t real. We don’t need to take them seriously, they’re not real artists,” says Adams. “It’s a disgraceful aberration of actual thinking about what people are seeing.” Critics, she says, are heavily invested in the idea of the “artist with a capital A”, so this sort of collaborative practice simply doesn’t seem to compute. Nor does the fact that autism doesn’t somehow preclude a person from being an artist. “We never talk about our work as outsider art. It’s just art,” says Adams. People are hopefully starting to recognise this. “I think we’re in a moment. I can’t say that I absolutely trust it. But it’s a good move in the right direction.” In London, Studio Voltaire is currently hosting the first significant survey outside of the US of the American artist William Scott’s prolific 30–year practice. It features among its 80 works Scott’s utopian depictions of an alternative San Francisco, known as Praise Frisco, an inclusive place free from crime and violence, and his portraits of black politicians, celebrities and activists including Maya Angelou, Prince and Barack Obama. Refreshingly, the materials surrounding the exhibition focus on Scott’s status as an artist in his own right – as opposed to his dual diagnosis of autism and schizophrenia – and his artistic concern with community, activism and urban development. The Studio Voltaire exhibition is a collaboration with Creative Growth, a non-profit in Oakland, California, where Scott has practiced since 1992. It is here that I find him when I call him over Zoom to discuss his work and practice. His emphasis on “wholesome encounters”, he tells me, comes from a utopian desire to create a better city. “There was too much violence on the news,” he says, of his interest in architectural painting. “That’s why it makes me draw new cities … I can make a new world when I paint.”Creative Growth doesn’t just provide space, materials and facilitators for neurodiverse artists; it also acts as agents, bridging the gap between them and the art world. It’s been running since 1974, so they’ve witnessed a lot of change over the decades, though, as gallery director Sarah Galender Meyer points out, it’s been something of a slow burn when you consider that Jean Dubuffet introduced the concept of art brut in the 1940s. “Even in the past 10 years, there has been quite an increase in acceptance and excitement in the art world,” Meyer says. “It’s really being embraced, even without being under the umbrella term of ‘outsider art’, or ‘self-taught’, which is used, and it’s fine, but I think that they’re just contemporary artists. They warrant the same kind of inquiry that other artists do.” At the heart of this acceptance, Meyer thinks, may be the dawning understanding that neurodiverse artists offer something new and exciting. “Collectors and institutions and galleries … everybody’s really interested in our artists’ process. And in their work, as well. It’s not like anything that anybody’s seen before. It’s different than somebody coming out of an MFA programme.” The discovery of neurodiverse artists is often led by other artists, she tells me. “It has typically been a pattern that contemporary artists are the first to discover and applaud the work of self-taught artists. They themselves are steeped in artistic process and are attracted to other artists that embody innovative practices.” That’s not to say that there isn’t work to do in changing perceptions. “Even in major exhibitions they are not always received as contemporary artists, which further marginalises their work,” says Meyer. “There is an assumption that unless an artist has received formal training and respond to the canon, their process is not ‘legitimate’.” Encouraging artists to speak for themselves is part of Creative Growth’s ethos. As Scott says, “art can help make the world better. It will bring peace to the world, and bringing peace makes people feel lucky and happier.” Later that week I’m at Hart Club, a studio space in an old estate agent’s shop in Lambeth, London, looking at some of the work its members have produced. Though much smaller and much newer than Creative Growth and Project Art Works, it shares with them a dedication to championing neurodiversity in the arts by working closely with small groups of neurodiverse artists and exhibiting their work.I’m here to meet Yangdzom Lama, an artist who works here, and whose paintings are like a beautiful, colourful mix of Frida Kahlo-esque symbolism and Tibetan thangka paintings of Buddhist deities. “I don’t remember this, but my dad used to be a thangka painter, and apparently I used to watch him when I was really little. So I guess all the colours got ingrained into my life.”“I’d love to be in exhibitions in galleries. That would be a dream come true,” Lama says, when I ask what she hopes for. Hart Club has given her happiness and a sense of community. “I did a term of art school at Camberwell College of Arts but I didn’t really like that,” she says. “There was just too many people (there were 600 on art foundation). At the time, I didn’t know that I was on the autism spectrum either.”“One thing that’s really wonderful about [Hart Club] is they know that I’m on the spectrum and they’re really accommodating towards that and just really nice. Back in Camberwell, I felt like they weren’t really aware of that kind of thing.” It wasn’t that she didn’t make friends at art school, she explains, so much as the fact that the tutors felt very removed. “It was hard to figure out who you could ask for assistance.”Hart Club was set up by artist and art school graduate Helen Ralli in 2018 after she worked on an exhibition of neurodiverse artists’ work called Great Minds Think Different. “I was really blown away by the work that I saw,” she says. But there was a disconnect between the work’s quality and where it was being seen, which was mostly limited to a community setting, so she resolved to provide a platform for some of the artists to exhibit. “Those events were a really mixed crowd, very different from the kind of typical art openings that I personally was experiencing before,” says Ralli.Neurodiverse people are often excluded from such environments, not to mention art school. Ralli said she saw first-hand how “incredibly selective” it is: “It felt lacking in terms of a creative environment, because it was the same people.” Hart Club is an alternative that aims to provide time, materials and encouragement in a nonhierarchical environment, with an emphasis on co-working. “I don’t think it’s about emulating the existing structures. It’s not about ticking boxes. It’s about having to completely rework and rewrite what creative spaces look like.”Like others in the field, Ralli finds the charity label problematic. “That’s really not what’s happening here,” she says. “Whether they’re a facilitator, or one of the artists, everyone is learning.” She also stresses that a diverse environment is a gift to be embraced by neurotypical artists as well. “Until you’ve really experienced what it is to have a culturally diverse space, I don’t think the true value of it is understood. This is more exciting, enhancing and enriching.”  Turner prize 2021 is on display at Herbert Art Gallery and Museum, Coventry, until 12 January and William Scott is at Studio Voltaire, London, until 2 January.",Arts/Art and design,‘I was blown away by the work I saw’: the Turner prize and the rise of neurodiverse art,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/dec/23/turner-prize-rise-of-neurodiverse-art-project-herbert-coventry
12/23/2021,"Successful clubs crave stability because that is what keeps them at the top. It is a trait Arsenal have lacked on and off the pitch in recent years but Mikel Arteta is bringing it back and putting them on an upward curve. When Arteta arrived the team were all over the shop but he has brought together a cohesive unit thanks to his tactics and the club’s recruitment. The former midfielder has enjoyed plenty of highs and endured numerous lows in his two-year tenure while sticking to his principles, which is paying dividends.  A sign of the stability is that Arteta has picked the same starting lineup for the past four Premier League games. Players want continuity, especially when it comes to the goalkeeper and backline, so they can learn about their movements, strengths and weaknesses, allowing them to create an understanding and grow together. The defence is reaping the rewards and bringing a solid base for others to build on. Aaron Ramsdale, Takehiro Tomiyasu and Ben White have slotted into a defence that could stay together for a long time, which is fantastic news for the club. Arsenal are being smart in the transfer market, signing only players aged 23 or under. It makes business sense, gives the players room to grow and offers the club financial gains because those players should hold or increase their value. Previous windows have not worked in terms of some senior signings, so bringing in younger players gives a little more freedom to allow time for development. Young players are naturally eager and it is a coach’s job to harness that in training to keep them firing. They will be hungry for a couple of seasons because they want to get called up to their international squads, win trophies and keep progressing. There will come transitional periods where Arsenal need to freshen things up but they are on a really good path. It helps that they have a number of young players for others to look up to. Emile Smith Rowe and Bukayo Saka have come through the academy and become first-team regulars. It has been a privilege to watch them grow since they were blooded in the Europa League two seasons ago, because they show what hard work and talent can achieve. I was at the Carabao Cup quarter-final against Sunderland on Tuesday and it was further evidence of the positivity around the Emirates. It was in effect their second string but they showed that competitiveness is running throughout the squad. Training must be very intense at the moment, with players pushing one another for their place in the team to ensure no one can rest on their laurels. Nuno Tavares is one of those players putting pressure on the man in front of him. He arrived from Benfica in the summer almost under the radar having not been a regular for his previous club but he has stood in for Kieran Tierney and even been selected ahead of him a few times, and Arsenal have not missed the more experienced left-back. This is not the case throughout the squad and is one of the areas Arsenal fall short in. Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea have two players for every position to ensure continuity. That’s where you need to be if you have regular Champions League aspirations. Arsenal are going in the right direction but there are areas to improve on. The major position holding Arsenal back is centre-forward, where they have problems. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s absence is well documented but he has also struggled for form over the past 18 months; Eddie Nketiah is yet to sign a new deal; and Alexandre Lacazette is doing well currently but it remains to be seen whether he is the long-term future as the main striker. They need to find some gem who will give them 20 goals a season if they are to reach the next level. It is interesting to look at the Aubameyang situation. Arteta has come out and said some things but we do not know fully what has happened. He is trying to build a culture and set standards and is showing that everyone, regardless of their status, is required to follow the rules. That allows players to know where they stand, which will help with creating that stability. Arsenal have struggled this season to compete with the three teams above them, losing those games in meek fashion. They have conceded 11 and scored zero goals against Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea, a statistic they will need to improve on to reach the same level. The Gunners will hope to still occupy fourth spot at the end of the season. With everything going on in football and the outside world there will be plenty of twists and turns and it could be a case of who copes best with the ups and downs. If you look at the past two seasons the margins are minuscule when it comes to winning the league, earning Champions League spots and determining relegation. They just need to ride this wave of momentum, because you never know where it could take them. Regardless of where Arsenal finish, the most important thing is that they improve on the previous campaign’s eighth place and keep on the upward curve Arteta and the squad have created. That is a challenge in itself but one they look set to meet.",Sport/Football,How Mikel Arteta and Arsenal brought back the Emirates feelgood factor | Karen Carney,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/dec/23/how-mikel-arteta-and-arsenal-brought-back-the-emirates-feelgood-factor
12/23/2021,"Puerto Rico was once a thriving agricultural hub thanks to its tropical climate, rich biodiversity, and sustainable farming traditions. Today, less than 2% of the workforce is employed in agriculture and tens of thousands of acres of arable land sit idle. Meanwhile 85% of the food eaten in Puerto Rico is imported, grocery prices are among the highest in the US and last year two in five people experienced food insecurity. “Unemployment is brutal, prices are brutal, migration from the island is brutal,” said Denise Santos, who runs Puerto Rico’s food bank.  Puerto Rico, a mountainous Caribbean archipelago, is also one of the places in the world most affected by extreme weather such as storms, floods and droughts. In 2017, Hurricane Maria devastated the islands and people went hungry as ships were unable to dock at the damaged ports. In the face of so many challenges, a new wave of interest in food and farming among younger Puerto Ricans is flourishing, as part of a wider movement demanding political, environmental and social justice. Small scale sustainable farming known as agroecology is driving a resurgence in locally grown produce that chefs, farmers, entrepreneurs and researchers argue can help revitalize the local economy, improve food sovereignty and both mitigate and adapt to the climate crisis. Agroecology is low impact agriculture that works with nature and local conditions to produce food sustainably so as to protect biodiversity and soil quality while drawing carbon out of the atmosphere. It involves a set of farming principles and practices that can be adapted to any ecosystem, microclimate and culture – a way of life practiced for thousands of years by indigenous people and peasant farmers. Farmers often integrate crops, livestock and trees (agroforestry) in order to maximize ecological conditions, such as a fruit orchard that aids water retention and provides shade for crops and grazing animals who in turn fertilize the earth to improve the yield. Crop rotation and crop cover are fundamental to this holistic approach, that takes into consideration the well-being of the Earth, those who produce the food as well as the local communities who eat it. Like in nature, every part of every ecosystem – which includes the farmers – help and depend on each other in some way. Contrast this to intensive industrialized farming which guzzles water, depletes the soil and burns fossil fuels (for fertilizers and powering machinery) to control the environment for genetically identical monocrop production. Advocates say agroecology offers locally driven solutions to a myriad of interconnected crises including food insecurity, biodiversity loss, environmental degradation and global heating. Agroecology is a social and political movement seeking to influence public policies so that sustainable farming benefits from government support (tax breaks, subsidies, and bailouts) currently propping up the dominant industrial agriculture system which is a major cause of biodiversity loss and accounts for more than a quarter of global greenhouse gases. “We would be far better transitioning away from the mess of the fossil fuel, planet-warming, industrial agricultural system that fights against nature, to climate-sensible agroecology that would produce the food we need while helping cool the planet down and increasing our carbon capital,” said Ricardo Salvador, director of the Union of Concerned Scientists’ food and environment program. Here we profile three agroecology farms striving to change what and how Puerto Ricans eat by challenging the political, economic and agricultural status quo. El Josco Bravo, Toa Alta After graduating with a degree in agronomy – the science of soil management and intensive crop production – Ian Pagán-Roig founded the Josco Bravo project in 2004 in the wild Toa Alta mountains as an act of political and social dissidence. At the time, agroecology was either ignored completely or ridiculed as a hippy movement by Puerto Rico’s universities and government officials, so Pagán-Roig started the farm and opened a school to radicalize a new generation of farmers. “We grew up in a colonial regime being told that without the US we would die from hunger or end up like Cuba. Our ancestors and lands were exploited, agriculture was disparaged, but we are part of a new generation that sees sustainable agriculture and food sovereignty as an act of rebellion,” said Pagán-Roig, 32. Puerto Rico was one of the first places colonized by the Spanish, who for four centuries exploited the island’s natural resources through the violent displacement of indigenous people and forced migration of enslaved Africans – until the Americans seized it in 1898. Over time, both occupying forces profited from cash crop plantations where campesinos were forced to work in such miserable conditions that parents pleaded with their children to study hard in order to avoid ending up being a farmer. The poverty and stigma associated with farming helped the US to roll out its industrialization plan in the mid-20th century, leading to an exodus from rural areas as farmers switched to factories. Farmland was abandoned, as manufacturing and then tourism became the mainstay of Puerto Rico’s economy. “The agroecology revolution on the island is about psychological and social transformation to achieve food and political independence because it recognises our land and people as our most valuable resources,” Pagán-Roig said. In the past eight years, more than 600 young people have graduated the program, and more than half of them are women – itself a radical change from industrial farming, which is dominated by men. The course now works with several universities across the island, with all students learning scientific principles and sustainable production techniques within a broader social and environmental justice framework. Industrial agriculture remains dominant, but the influence of agroecology is growing in mainstream politics as global heating forces farmers to adapt or fold. At the farm, education and innovation go hand in hand since extreme unpredictable weather is the new normal. In dry periods they rely on an artificial lake built after the 2014 to 2016 drought – Puerto Rico’s worst in a century. Now they’re building a greenhouse to protect vegetables from heavy rain which set back several crops this year. But genetic diversity in crops is key for natural adaptation to a changing environment, and the small team is currently testing 30 varieties of six vegetables – carrot, cabbage, broccoli, onion, pickling cucumber, and zucchini – to identify which are most resistant to heat, pests and tropical diseases. The school hopes to celebrate the thousandth graduate during the project’s 10th anniversary, but access to land and capital continue to limit ambitions for small scale farmers. After hurricane Maria struck and destroyed 80% of crops across the island, Organización Boricua, the oldest food sovereignty and farm justice network where Pagán-Roig serves on the board, organized solidarity brigades to clean up and repair farms so they could quickly start producing food for their communities. Still, access to federal funds remains bureaucratic and painfully slow, and many small scale farmers were forced to sell up. In addition, land prices are rising as speculators and developers take advantage of tax incentives and desperation. At Josco Bravo, located just 20 miles west of the capital San Juan, only 5 of the 69 acres rented from the department of agriculture are being farmed. The densely vegetated terrain is very fertile but requires substantial investment to clear and there’s no irrigation system and limited road access. The government won’t rent smaller plots, and accessing credit is tough, so large areas of public arable land remain abandoned. Pagán-Roig said: “We saw with Maria it’s very risky to be dependent on imports for our food, and we have enough good land in Puerto Rico to sustain our fruit, vegetable and starchy dietary needs, but we lack capital resources and political will.” Güakiá Colectivo Agroecológico, Dorado The Güakiá project is the collective brainchild of four graduates from Josco Bravo whose main objective is to improve access to healthy affordable food for vulnerable local communities. The farm is located off a highway in Dorado, an economically divided municipality with both multimillion dollar beach homes and families living hand-to-mouth in houses without indoor plumbing. The land belongs to a New York-based order of nuns who agreed to rent them 11 acres in 2017 for a symbolic amount ($1 per acre per year) after they’d almost given up hope of finding somewhere affordable. Back then it was a mess, having been used for years as an unauthorized rubbish dump, and they were still cleaning up when Maria struck, leaving many without work, shelter, food or clean water. By the beginning of 2018, they were able to share the first crop – plantain, beans, yuca and papaya – with families going hungry. “Agroecology has always been a form of resistance against colonial capitalism, and here we are trying to rescue collective working and reject individualism by reconnecting people to the land and food, and building trust and solidarity,” said Marissa Reyes-Diaz, 32, a biology graduate who also works for the nonprofit El Puente: Latino Climate Action Network. (All four members of the collective have second jobs.) Agroforestry is a big focus here, and there are fragrant fruit trees growing alongside a variety of crops, which has created multiple small ecosystems that help keep precious nutrients and rainwater in the ground. (Diversity enhances a farm’s resilience, as different crops are vulnerable and resistant to different pests, climate extremes and soil deficiencies.) So far the orchards have helped them survive two very dry spells, but it’s not enough to sustain and grow the farm, even with rainwater tanks and water from a neighbouring farmer. They’re trying to raise $40,000 to build a well connecting to the underground aquifer as water remains the biggest obstacle to long term success. But Güakiá is not just a farm, it’s also a community hub where neighbors come to enjoy the green spaces and try unfamiliar produce such as beets, turmeric roots and wild basil, as well as taste tomatoes fresh from the vine. Some locals volunteer, others exchange their food waste (needed to make compost) for vegetables, and prices remain accessible. They’ve hosted festivals with live music, art exhibitions, self defence classes, yoga and dominos - a very popular Caribbean pastime - and have built an emergency shelter fitted with solar panels ready for the next climate catastrophe. Reyes-Diaz said: “Agroecology has never been just about producing food, it’s also about sustaining our physical and mental health and spiritual wellbeing.” Frutos del Guacabo, Manatí Efrén Robles and Angelie Martinez, the couple who founded Frutos del Guacabo, are foodies not farmers. With little land at their disposal, Robles, an industrial mechanic, and Martinez, a chemist, started out using a soilless growing technique known as hydroponics to grow herbs, watercress and lettuce that chefs at their favorite restaurants struggled to find. Over the past 12 years, they’ve introduced livestock and expanded their techniques and crops, but the close relationship with chefs remains at the heart of the operation which now includes a distribution network with around 50 small farmers and more than 200 restaurants. The focus is on niche produce that chefs can’t get elsewhere: they grow sishito peppers, a smoky sweet Japanese variety served sauteed coated in sea salt, and the mindblowing habanada, a fairly recent creation by an organic breeder that looks, smells and tastes like the fiery habanero without any of the heat. “We can’t compete with the main chillies and peppers, so we focus on specialties and delivering consistency, which is what chefs want,” said Robles, 40. His favorite plant is the lemon drop, a bright yellow bullet shaped solid flower, better known as the toothache plant as it contains a natural anesthetic which briefly numbs the tongue and gums – a bit like popping candy or mild pins and needles. Chefs are sprinkling a few crushed petals in drinks or sorbets as a fun palette cleanser. The farm hosts open-kitchens: demos where chefs showcase what they can make with non-native ingredients such as eggplants, turmeric and lemon balm, while farmers explain what will grow in their particular microclimates. Connecting small farmers across the island with some of its most celebrated chefs has played an important role in Puerto Rico’s popular farm-to-table movement. According to Robles, high-end restaurants play an important role in changing dietary habits. “We work with top chefs to create enthusiasm for new produce that then cascades down to cafes and communities.” The soil in the central northern part of the island, just south of the Tortuguero lagoon, one of only two natural lakes in Puerto Rico, is very sandy so passion fruit trees are among those planted in compost filled tyres to protect fragile flowers and herbs from the coastal winds. Amaranth, an ancient seed enjoying a resurgence as a superfood in the Americas but which isn’t popular in Puerto Rico, is grown at strategic pointsto serve as a natural pest control. Rabbits and sheep are raised for meat; goats for milk, cheese and dulce de leche, while trying to create new breeds suited to Caribbean conditions. They recently started experimenting with an intensive but pretty sustainable farming practice that has roots in ancient civilizations like the Mayans and Aztecs. Aquaponics involves raising fish like Tilapia in tanks and then circulating that nutrient rich water to nourish soil-free plant beds of herbs and salad greens, before recirculating the water to the tanks. But while innovative small farms, farmers markets, pop-up kitchens, vegetable box schemes and farm-to-table restaurants are gaining popularity in Puerto Rico, it’s not easy competing in an economy designed to favor foreign investments and US exports. Robles said: “Eating is a political act, and reducing our dependence on imported food will help create a locally based more sustainable economy and environment. We’ve a long way to go but I’m going to die trying.”",News/Environment,‘An act of rebellion’: the young farmers revolutionizing Puerto Rico’s agriculture,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/23/puerto-rico-agroecology-farmers
