4/26/2022,"A pair of ospreys have made the first breeding attempt in southern England for almost 200 years. Conservationists are delighted that a pair of the birds at Poole Harbour, Dorset, have produced an egg, which they are guarding at a nest in a secret location. Thanks to nest cameras, viewers can watch the female osprey incubate her egg on a livestream. The birds of prey were once common across western Europe, but due to persecution by humans as well as habitat loss, they became locally extinct in the early 1800s. Their nests were historically plundered for their eggs, and the birds were shot for taxidermy. Today, they are still regularly shot for sport in southern Europe. Since 2017, experts at the Roy Dennis Foundation and Birds of Poole Harbour have been working to reintroduce them to southern England, by relocating adult birds from Scotland. There is a breeding population at Rutland Water in the Midlands, after a translocation programme that began in 1996, and after decades of conservation efforts there are now hundreds of ospreys in Scotland. Paul Morton from Birds of Poole Harbour said: “To know there’s now an osprey egg in a Poole Harbour nest is just amazing. This is the culmination of seven years’ hard work. Projects like this are always going to take time, but it’s such a great feeling to know that the birds have reached this important milestone, and to see CJ7 incubating her first egg is stunning. “There’s still a lot for them both to learn as new parents, and breeding success is certainly not guaranteed. However, everything we’re seeing at the moment is looking really positive, and hopefully by late May we’ll begin to see them feeding their newly hatched fledglings.” It is hoped that the pair will produce two more eggs over the next week, and then a 35-40 day incubation period beginswith the possibility of osprey chicks hatching by late May. Poole Harbour was chosen for the project because it has an abundance of fish for the birds to feed on. Ospreys from other parts of the UK have been known to pass through the harbour on their way to and from Europe on their migratory route, and they stop to hunt for grey mullet and flounder in the harbour’s large shallow channels and bays. This pair flew to west Africa last autumn, and the Birds of Poole Harbour teamfaced a seven-month wait to see if they would return. The birds’ passage to Africa is fraught with danger, including adverse weather conditions and illegal hunting. They both arrived at the beginning of this month and have settled to breed.",News/Environment,Dorset ospreys produce egg for first time in 200 years,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/26/dorset-ospreys-produce-egg-for-first-time-in-200-years
4/26/2022,"The fox puppet Basil Brush and singers Ed Sheeran and Sir Cliff Richard are among “national treasures” to feature in the platinum jubilee People’s Pageant carnival finale involving more than 10,000 people during the June bank holiday, organisers said. Against the backdrop of Buckingham Palace on Sunday 5 June, highlights will include puppet corgis and a giant 3D bust of the Queen, with television audiences across the globe expected to run into hundreds of millions. Sheeran, who will appear on stage to lead a tribute to the Queen, said: “I’m proud to be part of the celebration and it’s going to be a great opportunity to bring everyone together.”David Zolkwer, the show’s director, would not give further details, saying organisers want to “hold some surprises back for the day”. There is speculation that members of the royal family may make an appearance on the palace balcony at the finale, a possible moment for the Duke of Sussex, if he attends, but organisers would not be drawn on the rumours. Other celebrities confirmed to be taking part throughout the day include Dame Shirley Bassey, Kate Moss, Jeremy Irons, Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, Gary Lineker, Rosie Jones, Kadeena Cox, Alan Titchmarsh, Heston Blumenthal, James Martin, Bill Bailey and Gok Wan. The event will be split into four acts: For Queen and Country, The Time of Our Lives, Let’s Celebrate, and Happy and Glorious. For Queen and Country will feature a military parade with 1,750 people and 200 horses in one of the largest military spectacles in modern history, according to organisers. During a homage to the 1953 coronation, a huge wire-framed bust of the monarch will appear. Other highlights include an aerial artist suspended under a vast helium balloon, known as a heliosphere, bearing the image of the Queen, a giant oak tree flanked with maypole dancers, a huge moving wedding cake sounding out Bollywood hits, a towering dragon and three-storey-high beasts. Zolkwer said: “This is very much a ‘People’s pageant’ – it’s by and for the people. “It’s about ordinary people coming together from far and wide to do extraordinary things; real people with delightful, authentic stories to tell; taking centre stage in a spectacular performance filled with wonder, warmth, wit and so much humanity. It will be all about how, through the recollections and stories and experiences we share, we can see how we are all connected – through time; to each other; and to the Queen.” The procession will cover a route of nearly 2 miles, echoing the Queen’s coronation.",News/UK news,Ed Sheeran and Basil Brush to entertain at Queen’s platinum jubilee pageant,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/26/queen-platinum-jubilee-pageant-singers-basil-brush
4/26/2022,"Speaking a few hours ago about Twitter purchaser Elon Musk, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey declared: “I trust his mission to extend the light of consciousness.” Bless. This feels like the first flashback scene we see in a dystopian drama after the words “SIX MONTHS EARLIER…” Quite where we’ll be in six months’ time as far as Twitter is concerned remains tantalisingly unclear, but it seems difficult to imagine it will be either a more or less pleasant space. It’s a social media platform. I’m not sure what further evidence humanity needs before we cotton on to the idea that such a thing might be an intrinsically toxic concept. Of course, there will always be some people who think it just hasn’t been done right yet. Like communism, or a British version of the Daily Show. Anyway, if Musk’s takeover goes through, he’ll assume control of a platform where the people on the right are incredibly angry about free speech, and those on the left are incredibly angry about hate speech. Which is to say: they have so much in common. As the tech visionary Jaron Lanier has long been excellent at pointing out, the best way to keep people on platforms is to make them angry. So the platforms are designed to make them angry. You might consider the anger worth it for your version of advertising (I myself will post this column on Twitter), but even then it is a weirdly grim cost of doing business that just conceivably ought to be weighed far more carefully than it is. Unlike the UK, Musk manufactures other things besides anger, but Twitter is the platform where, in a single calendar year, his posts led to multiple lawsuits, a fall in his stock price, and a Securities and Exchange Commission settlement that resulted in his chairmanship of Tesla being forcibly ended. Yet in a move that will feel familiar to a lot of Twitter users, he has not logged off, but leaned in further. When I was a child, there was a guy called Victor Kiam who owned Remington, and he would personally feature in the firm’s electric razor adverts, going: “I liked the shaver so much, I bought the company.” It would be nice to see Musk do something similar. “I liked calling innocent people paedos so much, I bought the company.” Against this backdrop, the distress of Twitter users feels overplayed. Perhaps Elon embodies a kind of radical honesty and self-awareness not shared by other denizens of the site. People who seem to spend half their lives complaining about Twitter, on Twitter, seem stunned by the idea that a shitposter would ultimately buy it. Catch up! It doesn’t feel like a complete coincidence that all social media platforms are owned by men you’d run a mile from, socially. Musk is one of them – a brilliant, horrid, ridiculous and very occasionally endearing grotesque. A sort of intergalactically successful Dominic Cummings. And yet, despite Elon’s give-a-toss gift for making himself what Twitter users might call the “main character”, I can’t detest him entirely. If he pulls off the radical green energy transition embodied in Tesla, or even just one of his other wildly ambitious schemes, humans might have to accept some of the shit that’s gone with it. Accept it angrily, of course – how else, we’re on a social media platform! – but accept it nonetheless. A huge number of other people in public life behave appallingly and achieve absolutely nothing but harm. But if endlessly righteous folk do balk at the mere idea of necessary evils, why do they act like their own involvement in Twitter is one? It isn’t. It’s easy to focus on the high-profile people who are always on Twitter. But the sheer numbers of highly successful, highly creative and highly interesting people in the worlds of arts, business, science and beyond who AREN’T on it should tell a much more powerful story. They are part of all kinds of era-defining creative and commercial conversations and breakthroughs – and somehow manage to do it all without lavishing half the day scrolling past a bunch of other people having a row. Lanier has cast detailed doubt on whether most Twitter advocacy is even meaningfully effective, despite sometimes appearing to be so. If you spend your day caught up in online fighting, it’s preferable to tell yourself you’re involved in consciousness-raising for your cause. An alternative view is that you are simply obsessively polarising your particular debate, to the point where compromise – boring, unfashionable, yet historically always necessary – becomes a more distant possibility. My “unpopular opinion”, in one of Twitter’s tellingly popular phrases, is that those who spend a significant amount of time arguing on it work for the platform, and not for their cause. The Musk takeover at least makes it easier to see whose pocket you’re putting money into as you delude yourself you’re winning arguments. I’m certainly not saying I follow this rule, but in general I think arguing on the internet is like playing real tennis: even if you win, you’re still a twat.

4/26/2022,"Tim Westwood is one of the best-known names in British music, a veteran of the hip-hop scene whose opinions have been able to make or break upcoming artists for more than 30 years. Known, and often mocked, for his self-styled Big Dawg persona, the DJ has been a larger-than-life figure in hip-hop: his instantly recognisable drawl peppered with slang and clothing style little changed since the 1980s. The private school-educated son of the late Rt Rev Bill Westwood, a former Anglican bishop of Peterborough, he became a leading voice in black music, gaining notoriety after being injured in a drive-by shooting in 1999. For 20 years he was the voice of hip-hop on BBC Radio 1, and currently has a show on Capital Xtra as well as performing regular club nights across the UK and overseas. His career in music started 40 years ago, at the London nightclub Gossips, where he started as a glass collector but hustled to have his own set, promising to bring crowds to the club if allowed a warm-up at its reggae and jazz-funk nights. But hip-hop has always been Westwood’s obsession, and he soon had his own show on the London pirate station LWR. He was a co-owner of the pirate station Kiss FM, where he moved in 1985, before starting his own production and events company. In 1987, he joined Capital FM, before being lured to BBC Radio 1 in 1994 with the promise of leading its new rap show and bringing huge US stars to a UK audience. Five years into his stint at Radio 1, Westwood, then 41, was the victim of a drive-by shooting in south London, after he performed at an event in Brockwell Park, later saying the incident was linked to gang members attempting to extort money and stop him from DJing in the area. One bullet went through his seat, another through his arm. Throughout the 90s he became the face of the BBC’s rap and hip-hop output on Radio 1, before joining the digital station 1Xtra to front a new hip-hop show in 2007. At the time he was hailed by then head of programmes, Lorna Clarke, as one of the UK’s leaders in “bringing black music to a mainstream audience”. Westwood hosted the reality show Pimp My Ride UK on MTV UK between 2005 and 2007, and in 2009 he launched his YouTube channel, Tim Westwood TV. He started presenting the weekday BBC Radio 1Xtra drivetime show the same year, but by 2012 his star at the BBC was on the wane and he was taken off the slot as part of a reshuffle. A year later, the then 55-year-old left the station after two decades as it rejigged its Saturday night schedule. Westwood, who is unmarried, has said in interviews that music is his world and he did not have “anything else in my life”. “Everything’s been a choice. The career has been a choice,” he told the Guardian in 2017. “My focus and my discipline is this. So what you see is really what you get.” He insisted he had no plans to retire, saying his dedication to music had kept him relevant. “Legends live for ever,” he said. “And we’re one of the last real ones.”",News/Media,Tim Westwood: bishop’s son who became a hip-hop heavyweight,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/26/tim-westwood-bishop-son-hip-hop-rap-uk
4/26/2022,"The renowned DJ Tim Westwood has been accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women who claim he misused his position in the music industry to take advantage of them. Three women have accused the DJ of opportunistic and predatory sexual behaviour, while four others allege they were groped by him at events. The women, who were in their late teens or early 20s when they say the incidents happened, described their experiences to the Guardian and the BBC as part of a joint investigation into the former BBC Radio 1 DJ. The earliest alleged incident took place in 1992; the most recent in 2017. One of the women said: “Someone taking advantage of my naivety and lack of confidence isn’t something that I should have to carry with shame.” Westwood has strenuously denied all the allegations. A spokesperson said they were completely false and denied in their entirety. The women, who are all black, decided to tell their stories in the aftermath of anonymous allegations of inappropriate behaviour about Westwood circulating on social media in June 2020. In a statement at the time, Westwood denied any wrongdoing, saying the allegations online were fabricated, false and without foundation. The Guardian and BBC, which has released a documentary on BBC Three about the story, have since spoken to seven women who make a range of separate allegations about the DJ’s conduct. Some of the women say they felt unable to talk about their experiences before. They feared their accounts would not be taken seriously because they were so young at the time the alleged incidents happened – and that racial discrimination would also lead people to minimise, dismiss or ignore their claims. Three of the women have accused Westwood of opportunistic and predatory sexual behaviour when they agreed to meet him, thinking they would be discussing the music industry or their own work. They were 17, 19 and 20 at the time of the alleged incidents. A further four women claim the DJ groped them while they were having a picture taken with him after one of his nightclub performances. The Guardian and BBC know the identities of all the women, who are not known to each other and have never spoken. None of the women had reported their interactions to the police; all have asked to remain anonymous. Now 64, Westwood has been one of the best-known names in hip-hop and rap in the UK for the past 40 years. He became the genre’s unmistakable voice when he started hosting BBC Radio 1’s first Rap Show in 1994, credited with giving fresh talent an unparalleled platform while enticing the biggest rappers in the world – from Public Enemy to Jay-Z – on to his show. Westwood has always courted a degree of controversy, often playing to a bad-boy image with on-mic banter that can be provocative and sexually explicit. In 1999, he was injured in a drive-by shooting, with one bullet going through the seat of the car he was in and another through his arm. He became a key figure in black music in the UK and was named best DJ at the Mobo (Music of Black Origin) awards multiple times. After 20 years, the self-styled Big Dawg, left Radio 1, as part of a shake-up of its Saturday night schedule, and now hosts a show on Capital Xtra as well as regular club nights. Lawyers acting for Westwood said he was a well-respected and highly successful DJ. They said he strenuously denied in their entirety the serious allegations being made against him. “Any suggestion that he acts, or has acted, in the way described would be false and seriously defamatory.” They said he wanted to make clear that he did not behave in the manner described. Isabel* was 19 when she says she was the victim of Westwood’s alleged predatory behaviour in 2010. He was 53 at the time. The university graduate described wanting to pursue a career in music – she grew up in the Midlands, singing gospel and writing her own songs. When she discovered Westwood was DJing at a nightclub in her home town in 2010, she says she hoped to get her music into his hands. “At that moment, he was the main gatekeeper for access to what I needed to do,” she says. She described to the Guardian and BBC putting together a demo CD, with her contact details inside, and says she went to the nightclub, supported by her best friend and stepmother. Isabel says they managed to give the CD to the DJ, who, to her excitement, called her the next day and suggested meeting in London. “We were thinking that this is a really good lead at this point,” she says. “He wants to act on this quickly.” She says a few days later she took the train to London for an afternoon meeting and met Westwood at Oxford Circus, where he picked her up in his car. Isabel says her “complete assumption” was that they were going somewhere to talk about her music. “The phone call was the only interaction we’d had before that,” she says. “There was nothing flirtatious or romantic about the nature of the conversation.” But she says that when the journey lasted longer than she expected and her surroundings became unfamiliar, she started to become anxious. “We got in the car. He made the most minimal amount of small talk. I could tell that he wasn’t particularly interested in the music thing,” she says. Isabel says she was looking away from him but then claims she turned to find Westwood had undone his trousers and was exposing himself. “I didn’t actually see him undo his trousers. What alerted me to the fact that he was exposing himself was the fact that he actually tapped me to turn around to look. I’ve looked and I’ve seen and I’m like, ‘Oh, no, oh no, like, oh my God’,” she says. Isabel says she felt scared but unable to get herself out of the situation. She says they arrived at a flat, which she believes was his, where he offered her a drink – which she refused. It was in this flat, which Isabel says was strewn with records, that she claims she was the victim of a second episode of opportunistic and predatory sexual behaviour. She claims that when Westwood came back from getting himself a drink in another room, he was naked. “That’s when I noticed that he’s got a condom and he’s removed it [from the packet] and started putting it on,” she says, adding that she recognised the condom from a promotion Westwood had done with the brand Durex – which he promoted at events across the country. “I remember the packet because they had this slogan on it. They had his face on the other side,” she says. “I remember him throwing it down. I remember the fact that it was yellow. Like, I remember that very vividly because I remember that was kind of when my brain also started to shut down.” She says Westwood initiated sex, and although she did not vocalise her misgivings, she was “frozen”. “I didn’t have any sort of guard up for that situation,” she says. “It’s all very reactive … because it’s just happening. And the shock factor of it is so overwhelming that it kind of disorientates the rest of the way you think. It’s like you’re stunned.” Isabel says Westwood then left the room. When he returned she had her bag on her lap to indicate she wanted to leave, and he took her to a train station. She says that as he dropped her off he tried to give her one of his mix CDs but she refused. Isabel says she felt “stupid” on the train journey home. “I just remember feeling so deflated. So sad. Feeling really ashamed of myself and bad.” She says she remembers getting a text message from her friend who had been waiting to hear how the meeting had gone. “I didn’t say what happened but I sent a text to let her know like we didn’t listen, it didn’t happen. We didn’t listen to my music … it’s not gone down like that.” Isabel’s stepmother told the BBC and Guardian the whole family had been excited about Isabel meeting the DJ, hoping for a breakthrough in her career. But she knew instinctively that something “was wrong” when her stepdaughter would not talk about the meeting. But she says after she heard Isabel’s story, she felt guilty for not chaperoning her – and says she cried when Isabel disclosed that her silence was partly due to fears that her family would be disappointed in her. Like others the Guardian and BBC spoke to, Isabel says she became aware in 2020 of allegations being made by women on social media alleging misconduct by Westwood. Isabel says she is telling her story now because she felt what had happened to her was an abuse of the DJ’s position. “It is a privilege to be able to do what you love as a job and it’s a privilege to be given a platform to do it on,” she says. “So it’s a massive violation when you abuse that.” Westwood has strenuously denied acting in the manner described by Isabel. Pamela’s* story shares similarities with Isabel’s. Now in her 40s, Pamela was 20 when she says she first met the DJ through friends. It was 2000 and she was active in the youth rap scene, working with aspiring young musicians. The DJ – then in his 40s – wanted to connect with a younger audience and asked her to do work experience with him, she says. She says he reassured her mother on the phone, and Pamela travelled to London to meet him for work experience. But when Westwood picked her up from King’s Cross train station in a large American-style car he soon began touching her leg and face while he was driving, she alleges. She says while she was batting his hand away he was not concentrating on the road and was driving erratically. A police officer on a motorbike pulled up alongside the car and knocked on the passenger window. Pamela says she sat in silence as Westwood apologised and was told to keep his eyes on the road. Pamela says she had expected to stay on her own in a hotel, although this had not been discussed, and instead she says he drove her to what she understood to be his flat. “If you’re going to do an internship somewhere, you’re not expecting for that person to take you to their house. That’s unprofessional,” she says. After some hours, the DJ sat next to her and tried to kiss her neck and remove items of her clothing, she says, adding that she moved away, trying to replace them. “I didn’t give him any kind of come-on. There was no flirtation,” she says. She says when Westwood initiated sex, she remembers thinking she could not get out of the situation. “I’m in London alone with this man. Now if I try to get out of this, who’s to say how he’s going to react. So I just submit to it.” She says she has not spoken about the encounterin its entirety, until now. “People like me don’t ever get believed when we speak about stuff like this, so we don’t,” she says, adding that she found the encounter “traumatic”. “It was disgusting and I felt like shit afterwards, really disgusting,” she says. She says the work experience he offered never happened, and she went home as soon as she could. Pamela later spoke to a friend who works in the music industry and they encouraged her to talk about her experience in this investigation. Tamara* says she first met Westwood when she was a 17-year-old member of a British R&B group and he was in his mid-30s and the “No 1 hip-hop DJ at the time”. She says when he asked if she wanted to “hang out”, she thought it was to talk about her career. “He could make or break your career,” she says. “If you wanted to get any kind of exposure, you would try to get your demo to him and pray that he would play it. He had absolute power. “Within the recording industry and the black community, despite him being a white man, he had absolute power.” But Tamara says that once they were in a flat she believes was his, without saying anything he pulled down her trousers and underwear. She claims he then began performing oral sex on her. “There was no talking. There was no kind of communication about that. It was just before I knew it, that’s what was happening,” she says. Tamara says she was taken aback and at first tried to push his head and shoulders away. “And then I realised that, you know what? I’m in a position where it’s already gone too far,” she says. “I’m already far from home. I wouldn’t even know how to leave this particular place. I wouldn’t know how to get home from here ... Then he finishes and it’s as if that hadn’t happened.” The woman says they then had casual sex two or three times over a period of three years. Looking back at those encounters, Tamara says she was so young she lacked “the strength and courage” to say: “‘No … I don’t feel right about this’, because I didn’t feel right about it.” Now with a daughter in her 20s, Tamara says she has decided to share her experience for the first time after her daughter showed her the online allegations about Westwood that surfaced in 2020, adding that she was concerned his ongoing regular club nights meant he was often in contact with young women. In 2021, Tamara watched the BBC documentary Music’s Dirty Secrets and contacted the producers asking them to investigate the DJ. The Guardian and BBC also spoke to four other women who claim they were groped by Westwood when they posed for a picture with him, after he had performed DJ sets. The Guardian and BBC have seen the Snapchat footage and the images the women say were taken during the encounters. The earliest dates to 2000, when Farah* was 19 and working with a promotional street team during Bristol carnival. Afterwards she says she met Westwood, then in his mid-40s, at an afterparty and recalls him asking about her work. She says when the event had finished, the street team gathered to take a photograph with the DJ, but as it was being taken he put his hand inside her T-shirt and grabbed her breast. “Just the thought of somebody doing that – I felt cold. And I felt dirty. I felt humiliated, embarrassed. That I’d done something wrong,” she says. Two women allege they were groped in 2009, when the DJ was in his early 50s. In the summer, Claire*, then 20, went to a nightclub in Ayia Napa – the DJ had been playing and she says she queued to take a photograph with him after his set. But as her friend was taking the picture, she claims Westwood said “lemme grab some ass” and put his hand down the back of her denim shorts. “As I was shocked, I froze and felt very intimidated,” she says. “He then started asking if I was interested in going back to where he was staying to ‘chill’, as I was stood, still mentally trying to process what just happened.” She says she turned down the offer. Later in the year, before Christmas, Loretta* says she also posed for a photograph with the DJ after he had performed at a nightclub in Essex. The then 19-year-old says she felt the DJ’s hand go down her back and grab her bottom, before resting on her neck. “In that moment, I was kind of frozen and I didn’t really know how to react,” she says. “I mean, I know how I would react now as a grown woman, but as a teenager, I really didn’t.” Nyla* says she met Westwood nine years later, in 2017, when she was 22 and he was 59 and DJing at a New Year’s Day event in London. She says he got his security to ask her on stage, and when she did he used the microphone to declare her “the pengest girl in the rave”. At the end of the night she says her friend wanted a video of the DJ. While the pair posed, Nyla says Westwood moved his hand down her back and up the back of her skirt. “I couldn’t really do anything to stop it or prevent it. So it felt like that had been taken out of my hands,” she says. Nyla says Westwood called her the next day on Snapchat – she thinks after getting her number from a guest list – “asking if I want to hang out and stuff” and telling her she did not have to come alone and could bring friends. She says before long she ended the conversation and blocked his number. “Sometimes I just feel like his persona or his kind of stage character, people take that really lightly and see it as something that’s sort of satirical when actually it’s not really funny,” she says. “I didn’t have a chance to voice my own opinion in that moment. I didn’t really feel like a human. I just felt objectified.” *Names have been changed.

4/26/2022,"Welcome to Pushing Buttons, the Guardian’s gaming newsletter. If you’d like to receive it in your inbox every week, just pop your email in below – and check your inbox (and spam) for the confirmation email. These days, video games aren’t often tied to a particular console or gadget – even if something like Halo or God of War originally appears on Xbox or PlayStation, it will often eventually make its way to PC, and the majority of games come out on everything at the same time. Unless you’re playing a console-exclusive game like Returnal, specifically designed around the PlayStation 5 controller with its adaptive triggers and fancy haptic feedback, the experience of the game isn’t shaped much by the hardware you play it on. You can play Minecraft with a controller or a mouse or on your phone, and it’s still largely the same. The exception to this is, as ever, Nintendo, the gaming powerhouse that always seems to be the exception to every rule. Its games are still, and always have been, inspired by and inextricably tied to the machines that the company designs. There could be no Wii Sports without the motion-sensing Wii Remote to wave around, no Dr Kawashima’s Brain Training without the Nintendo DS’ touch screen. The DS particularly had a lot of games that could only have worked on that hardware, with all its little gimmicks. There’s a puzzle in one of the DS Zelda games where you have to get someone on the far bank of a river to lower a bridge for you, and after several stumped minutes I suddenly realised that I had to actually shout at them, in real life, into the console’s microphone. I tried it, and it worked, and it was simultaneously one of the most stupid and most magical moments I’ve ever had in a game. I’ve been thinking about this because I’ve spent the last few weeks playing around with the Playdate, a little yellow handheld console with a black and white screen, two buttons, a D-pad and a crank. An actual little crank on the side of the machine, which is used in all of the experimental games that come with the console. You use it to focus a camera, surf waves, move forward or backwards through time. The developers making these microgames – including indie legends such as Keita Takahashi (Katamari Damacy) and Bennet Foddy (QWOP) – have evidently found the crank to be a delightful source of inspiration. It’s a reminder that gimmicks can and do actually inspire creativity. New games will arrive on the Playdate every week, coming in seasons. None of them last long, usually a few minutes to a half-hour’s play, but every one I’ve played has been very endearing. This wee console is definitely a curio, and an expensive one at $179, but it’s just so charming. It’s made me miss my old bright yellow Game Boy Color, which I spent several years begging my parents for, and which eventually arrived just in time for the best years of the original Pokémon craze. I still remember how the smooth buttons felt under my thumbs. This is one reason why, despite the games industry’s current enthusiasm for streaming and subscription services, I doubt that the console (or the controller) will ever become a thing of the past. We have sensory memories tied to the Spectrum’s rubber keyboard or the GameCube’s strange little controller with its bizarre button layout, the clamshell snap of a DS or the clicky shoulder buttons of a PlayStation pad. (I’d say something nice about the Dreamcast pad but let’s be real, it is mostly memorable for how terrible its analogue sticks were.) We like gadgets. They’re fun to play with. Games consoles and controllers are more than just tools: they’re toys, too, and their design is an art in itself. PS: Following last week’s issue about the bizarre social stigma that still sometimes comes with video games, I’ve had an update from Daniel, whose boss gave him a hard time for playing Switch on his lunch break. He writes: “I’ve had no further incidents between my boss and my Switch and I have continued to play on my lunch break, if even only for a few precious minutes. I told some colleagues about our CEO’s reaction and interestingly, pretty much everyone thought it was ridiculous, and it turned out that a couple of them are gamers as well, something we had never spoken about before … One is a rather serious guy in his late twenties who has just got his hands on an PS5, and the other is a female colleague in her late fifties who was given her nephew’s old Xbox 360 to try out and discovered to her surprise that she really enjoyed the gaming experience and is now a convert (she’s currently taking a walking tour through Skyrim – her words). It was nice to discover that I now have a little gaming posse in the office. I’m sure there are others as well, we just haven’t smoked them out them yet.” Video games, bringing people together yet again. It’s like a not-very-secret club full of fun people. Remember Wii Sports? Family Christmases enlivened by virtual bowling? Kids getting too enthusiastic in the boxing mini-game and nearly sending a Wii remote through the TV or into their sibling’s face? Nintendo Switch Sports is out this week, a modern take on motion-controlled multiplayer sports, and honestly not a lot has changed apart from the slicker aesthetic. Tennis is still here. Bowling is still here. It also has badminton, volleyball, sword-fighting, and a clearly Rocket League-inspired take on football. It’s all playable online as well as together in person, though honestly without the inherent slapstick comedy element of watching someone else swing a pretend tennis racket, it rather loses something. A no-brainer for anyone with a Nintendo Switch and at least one real-life friend or family member.

It talks a lot about the crank. The Washington Post explores why esports careers are so short: the average professional gamer competes for only a few years and usually retires before their mid-twenties. In short, if you know an aspiring 17-year-old esports star and they’re not competing, they’re already leaving it a bit late. Also on Polygon: Charlie Hall interviews game developers in Ukraine, who are staying right where they are and hoping to bolster their country’s economy. “When peace comes we will all be needed even more to help rebuild and the idea of abandoning Ukraine entirely at a time like that is inconceivable,” said Frogwares’ Paul Milewski. Not strictly games, but I can’t stop thinking about this NYT story about a man who married a fictional character (Hatsune Miku, a Japanese pop star who is in fact made up). Shoot em up! How TV fell in love with video games Another great question this week from reader Lawal Muhammad, who asks: “What are the best games about professions? My vote would probably go to Crazy Taxi (Sega Arcade/Dreamcast) or Cannon Fodder (Amiga).” Games about jobs are, for some reason, absurdly compelling, as proven by the enduring popularity of Football Manager and Euro Truck Simulator (and its ilk). For me however they are especially fun when they bear absolutely no resemblance to the real-life version of the job. I lost an entire summer to Game Dev Story once, one of a series of cutesy management games on smartphones that managed to make sourcing funding, hiring developers, getting your first hit game and then making endless sequels into a crazed dopamine rush. I love being a lawyer in the mad anime courtrooms of Phoenix Wright. And at the risk of disappearing down a self-referential rabbit hole, I have to mention Job Simulator, a comedy VR game that imagines a future museum of professions in the year 2050, where you can try out being a shop clerk or office worker, except it’s much funnier than anything that has ever happened in an actual office.",Arts/Games,Pushing Buttons: Need nostalgia?

4/26/2022,"Hours after the deadly Capitol attack on 6 January 2021, the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, told a reporter he was “exhilarated” because he thought Donald Trump had finally lost his grip on the party. Close to a year and a half later, however, with midterm elections looming, Trump retains control over the GOP and is set to be its presidential candidate in 2024. What’s more, McConnell has said he will support Trump if so. McConnell’s short-lived glee over Trump’s apparent downfall is described in This Will Not Pass, an explosive new book by Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns of the New York Times which will be published next week. The Guardian obtained a copy. The two authors describe a meeting between one of them and McConnell at the Capitol early on 7 January 2021. The day before, a mob Trump told to “fight like hell” in service of his lie about electoral fraud attempted to stop certification of Joe Biden’s election victory by forcing its way into the Capitol. A bipartisan Senate committee connected seven deaths to the attack. In the aftermath, 147 Republicans in the House and Senate nonetheless lodged objections to electoral results. According to Martin and Burns, McConnell told staffers Trump was a “despicable human being” he would now fight politically. Then, on his way out of the Capitol, the authors say, McConnell met one of them and “made clear he wanted a word”. “What do you hear about the 25th amendment?” they say McConnell asked, “eager for intelligence about whether his fellow Republicans were discussing removing Trump from office” via the constitutional process for removing a president incapable of the office. Burns and Martin say McConnell “seemed almost buoyant”, telling them Trump was now “pretty thoroughly discredited”. “He put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger,” McConnell is quoted as saying. “Couldn’t have happened at a better time.” The authors say McConnell indicated he believed he would regain control of his party, alluding to a previous confrontation with the far right and saying: “We crushed the sons of bitches and that’s what we’re going to do in the primary in ’22.” McConnell also said: “I feel exhilarated by the fact that [Trump] finally, totally discredited himself.” McConnell’s words ring hollow, in fact, as the 2022 midterms approach. Trump endorsements are highly prized and Republicans who voted for impeachment are either retiring or facing Trump-backed challengers. Trump was impeached for a second time over the Capitol attack but as Burns and Martin describe, McConnell swiftly realised that most Republican voters still supported the former president – many believing his lie about electoral fraud – and that most Republicans in Congress were going to stay in line. Burns and Martin describe how in Trump’s Senate trial, Democratic House managers sought to convince McConnell of their case, knowing his loathing for Trump and hoping he would bring enough Republicans with him to convict. But McConnell, grasping a legal argument which said Congress could not impeach a former president, did not join the seven Republicans who did find Trump guilty of inciting an insurrection. After voting to acquit, McConnell excoriated Trump, saying he was “practically and morally responsible” for the Capitol attack. That did not change the fact that thanks in large part to McConnell, Trump remains free to run for office again.",Arts/Books,"McConnell was ‘exhilarated’ by Trump’s apparent January 6 downfall, book says",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/26/mcconnell-exhilarated-trump-january-6-book-this-will-not-pass-burns-martin
4/26/2022,"The loudest reaction to Elon Musk buying Twitter, for some reason, has been concern about “free speech”. The second loudest reaction has been dismay about the fact that Elon Musk is a bad guy, and now he owns Twitter. I regret to inform you that both of these reactions are missing the point here – and the point is much, much scarier. Will Elon Musk do anything meaningful to transform Twitter into a valuable and flourishing public square, a shining beacon of the power of untrammelled free speech to ennoble society, rather than the cesspool of neuroses, conspiracy theories and media feuds that it is now? Probably not. On the other hand, it’s already a cesspool. Can’t get too much worse. Is Elon Musk a bad guy? Yes he is. He is a union buster, a selfish wealth hoarder, a man who holds the utterly wrong conviction that society owes him everything, rather than vice versa. He has this in common with virtually every other billionaire corporate titan. The only morally neutral billionaires are those who got their wealth more or less by accident, and who are working full time to give it all away as fast as possible. This is a very short list that does not include Elon Musk. On the other hand, it also does not include the founder of Twitter, another megalomaniacally misguided tech billionaire. In fact, most of the people who own or run most of biggest companies in the US are cut-throat profit seekers who would, no matter what their PR department says, put children to work in a knife factory for 10 cents an hour to add a half a percentage point to their quarterly earnings if they could get away with it. Twitter’s new billionaire may be somewhat more pernicious or more selfish than the old billionaire, but in the big picture, this is a marginal change. No, the real thing that should be on your mind as a result of this stupendously rich nerd buying this company purely for kicks is this: the amount that a rich person feels comfortable spending on a toy has now reached $44bn. Twitter was, to be clear, a toy purchase for Musk. Nobody in their right mind believes that he bought this global company with 7,000 employees and hundreds of millions of users and a stock price that has gone nowhere for a decade for business reasons. He bought it because he is so, so astronomically wealthy that it is possible for him to pay $44bn in order to satisfy his vague personal appetite for mischief, to become the center of the universe of memes. The fact that this is true is a dark sign for us all. You might have thought inequality was bad when you saw hedge fund managers paying more than $100m for garish apartments. You might have thought inequality was out of control when individual rich guys started paying more than $2bn for professional sports franchises. Ha. Those types of toys look absolutely paltry now. We have entered a new era at the Billionaire Toy Store – an era in which entire public companies will be plucked off the shelf and taken private not for any typical business reasons, but because some guy just happens to have some idiosyncratic ideas about how amusing it would be to do so. The problem with having this much inequality – with having a tiny little nest of billionaires sucking up such a huge share of society’s wealth – is that the more wealth that individuals get, the less accountable to society itself they become. Their power to do whatever they want gets ever more unconditional. And that is dangerous. I don’t care if you like Twitter, or dislike Twitter, or have never heard of Twitter. This is not about Twitter. This is about a highly unequal nation in which one man can spend the equivalent of the annual budget of the state of Arizona for a shiny bauble, just because he feels like it. Some cling to the hope: “Perhaps the person who, through a twist of fate, finds himself the richest man in the world will be wise and just, so we don’t have to worry.” Unfortunately, nobody who is wise and just would ever be able to accumulate the $260bn net worth of Elon Musk without collapsing into a puddle of self-contradiction – and even if they did, they would spend it on (plausible!) things like “ending homelessness” or “solving world hunger”, rather than on “a goofy joke purchase that feeds seamlessly into my own out of control grandiosity”. The inescapable conclusion here is that allowing people to get this rich is inherently dangerous to our delicate social balance, and also that only people with great moral flaws can ever become this rich. So we are guaranteed, if we let inequality continue unabated, to find ourselves more and more at the mercy of sociopaths. Democracy, for all its flaws, is redeemed by the one great insight that you can’t prevent sociopaths from existing, but if you spread power more or less equally around a nation, at least the sociopaths will be balanced out somewhat by the non-sociopaths. We have never, of course, achieved this perfect balance in reality. But now, it seems, we have stopped even trying. Do not weep for Twitter, its users, or its investors. Weep for the entire chain of bad political decisions that allowed us to get to this point. This is just a preview. In the future, the billionaire toys won’t be quite so fun.

4/26/2022,"For the past 10 years or so, if you lived in a big city and fancied hearing an orchestra play something from Metal Gear Solid or Sonic the Hedgehog instead of the Romantic period, there has been no shortage of options. Touring orchestras have played music from games such as Pokémon, Final Fantasy and Assassin’s Creed for appreciative audiences all over the world. The largest such series, Video Games Live, has been running since 2005 and has played over 400 shows in Los Angeles, Beijing, Sydney and elsewhere. But this summer, for the first time, video game music will be part of the BBC Proms season at the Royal Albert Hall in London. A concert on 1 August will feature orchestral selections and adaptations from soundtracks spanning gaming history, including The Legend of Zelda, Shadow of the Colossus and Battlefield 2042. “We’ve always very happily put on concerts of film music, [but] I think if I’m honest we haven’t felt it was quite the right moment to put on a gaming music prom until now, because we were still waiting for a lot of composers to enter this field,” says David Pickard, director of the Proms. “Now we can be there on the front foot and say that there’s a huge range of music here, appealing to a new audience, and of a very high quality that we’re really happy to have at the Proms.” The concert, curated and conducted by Robert Ames, who also worked on 2009’s Sound of Space prom featuring music from sci-fi films, will range from orchestral arrangements of early 8-bit chiptune music through to the full scores that grace modern multimillion-dollar game productions. “The history of video game music and electronic music in general are very closely linked,” explains Ames. “Early gaming was not technologically advanced enough to accommodate orchestras or analogue music, so composers would be as creative as possible within the boundaries of the hardware and software of the time. As consoles grew in sophistication, so did video game music. This growth runs side by side with the melding of analogue and electronic music, which are now barely distinguishable in modern culture.” The most contemporary piece is an arrangement from 2021’s Battlefield 2042, whose soundtrack was composed by Hildur Guðnadóttir – perhaps best known for her Oscar-winning score for The Joker – and Sam Slater. It was the first video game soundtrack that either composer had worked on, and Guðnadóttir says that the non-linearity of video games, the way that the player can influence the sound with their actions, was particularly interesting to work with. “Gamers are such loyal fans of their games – it’s exciting for them to come and experience that music live in an orchestral setting,” she says. “I think it’s great that the Proms, which is such an establishment, is opening the doors to a new audience that maybe wouldn’t necessarily go to a classical concert.” The connection that people feel to video game music can be profound: when a player spends 50 hours or more with a game, the soundtrack becomes particularly embedded in the memory. In the same way as any piece of music can become deeply evocative of particular periods of our real lives, game music accompanies the memorable experiences that players have in virtual worlds, experiences that they have often shaped themselves through their actions and choices within the game, and which therefore hold special significance. “The nostalgia of gaming music is very much part of our lives,” says Ames. “It’s great that the Proms are keen to highlight the cultural significance and quality of gaming music. The fanbase is massive and gaming music since its inception has been ahead of the curve in terms of diversity. I really believe somebody like [Kingdom Hearts composer] Yoko Shimomura should be celebrated at an international music festival alongside composers like Brahms and Mahler.” For the Proms, that gaming fanbase – the majority of which is aged between 18 and 44 – represents a valuable new audience for orchestral music, something that Pickard sees as an obvious mission for the festival. “What I hope is that you might come along to hear the gaming Prom and then think, the sound of a live orchestra is amazing, I think I’ll try the Beethoven 5th Symphony tomorrow night,” he says. “Or, actually, the other way round – that the people who come to classical concerts might say, how interesting to go and experience some music that I don’t already know.” ",Arts/Games,Pokémon goes to the Proms: 2022 season to feature first video game music concert,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/apr/26/pokemon-goes-to-the-proms-2022-season-to-feature-first-video-game-music-concert
4/26/2022,"Moldova’s president, Maia Sandu, is convening a meeting of her security council on Tuesday following a series of incidents in the breakaway Moldovan republic of Transnistria and a warning from Moscow that the Russian-backed region could be drawn into the war in Ukraine. Transnistria, which borders western Ukraine, is controlled by pro-Russia separatists and permanently hosts 1,500 Russian troops as well as a large arms depot. Last week, a senior Russian commander said the goal of Russia’s new offensive was to seize control of southern Ukraine and to gain access to Transnistria, creating worries that the small east European country could become a new flashpoint in growing tensions between Moscow and the west. On Tuesday morning, local authorities said that two antennas that carried Russian radio broadcasts were blown up, the second episode of violence reported in the enclave in as many days after unknown attackers shelled the region’s state security ministry in Tiraspol with a handgrenade launcher on Monday. Commenting on the first explosion at the security ministry, the Moldovan government said the incident was aimed at “creating pretexts for straining the security situation” in the breakaway region. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday told journalists that he was “concerned” about the news that came out of Transnistria. And hours earlier, the leader of the self-proclaimed republic in Donetsk, Denis Pushilin told the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti that Russia should “take into account what is happening in Transnistria”, when planning the next stage of its military campaign. Officials in Transnistria on Tuesday announced a number of new security measures, further raising concerns about a possible escalation in the breakaway state. These measures included the instalment of military checkpoints at the entrances to the cities of the region and the cancellation of the annual 9 May victory day parade. Bob Deen, an expert on Moldova and a senior research fellow at the Clingendael Institute thinktank, said it was difficult to know at this point whether the recent incidents were a false flag operation by Russia or genuine acts of sabotage by anti-Russian groups. But he said recent Russian rhetoric points to some of the long-term goals Russia has in mind for Transnistria. “We have seen that the topic of Transnistria is becoming discussed more openly in the Russian public domain. Russian recent statements could be an indication of the ambitions Moscow has there.” According to Deen, it was unlikely that Russian forces would be able to stage an offensive toward the border with Moldova at this moment, given that Moscow is currently engaged in heavy fighting in the eastern Donbas region. To get to Transnistria, Moscow would need to stage an offensive toward Odesa, which has been hindered by the recent sinking of the Moskva cruiser, which forced Russian warships to move further away from Ukraine’s coast. Deen was also sceptical that Transnistria’s own forces, which number around 7,500 troops, would be used in an attack on Ukraine from its western border. “There is little appetite to fight in Ukraine among the Transnistrian troops as well as the general population in the region, many of whom are leaving towards Moldova to escape any potential violence.” “Similarly to Belarus, the region does not want to be fully dragged into this war,” he said, adding that the recent rhetoric by Moscow might be a ploy designed to get Ukraine to pull troops away from the Donbas towards its western border. With Russian backing, Transnistria fought a war against Moldova in the early 1990s that left the territory with de facto independence and a permanent Russian garrison. Russian state media – widely available in Transnistria – have played a significant role in cementing pro-Russian attitudes in the enclave as Moldova has shifted towards the west under the leadership of its liberal president. Last week, Sandu signed into law a bill banning the orange and black striped ribbons of Saint George, which enjoy wide popularity in Russia as a way to show public support for the government and the military, a move that angered Russian officials. In the same bill, Sandu also banned the prowar signs “Z” and “V” first used by the Russian armed forces.",News/World news,Moldova holds security meeting as tensions rise over breakaway region,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/26/moldova-holds-security-meeting-as-tensions-rise-over-breakaway-region-transnistria
4/26/2022,"Social workers failed to act to protect a vulnerable toddler less than three weeks before she was hospitalised with a broken arm, despite warnings that she was neglected and at risk of harm, an inquiry report has concluded. A review found health visitors and social workers repeatedly delayed intervening over months of mounting evidence that the girl was experiencing physical and emotional trauma and her parents were failing dismally to care for her. The girl was chronically underweight, left for hours in dirty nappies, slept in a bare cot in midwinter, was socially isolated and never spent time with other children, had no toys, and presented as “sad, watchful and frozen”, the report says. “The home environment in which [the child] spent the first 17 months of her life can be described as one of chronic neglect, fear, understimulation, discomfort, loneliness and physical harm,” the child safeguarding practice review found. Northamptonshire Safeguarding Children Partnership, which carried out the inquiry, said professionals had failed to act decisively on the reams of evidence they had accumulated, leaving the girl exposed to months of significant harm and neglect. “If there is one important and resounding lesson to be learned from this review is that it is not enough for professionals to observe and record signs of neglect and abuse. Action is required if children are to be protected from significant harm,” it concluded. Health visitors had been concerned about the girl’s growth and development soon after her birth. Although they noted the mother had mental health problems, lacked attachment to her daughter, and could be hostile and evasive, they failed to refer the case to child protection teams for more than a year. When social workers finally got involved in September 2018, there were further delays and drift, and the situation came to a head shortly before Christmas that year when an engineer sent to repair a boiler raised the alarm after seeing the girl in a cot with her arms taped to her sides with electrical wire and surrounded by used nappies. Social workers visited the family again but despite clear signs things were not well they failed to ask about the taping of the girl’s arms. They decided not to escalate the case, instead leaving her parents with instructions “on what was needed to change” in their parenting methods to ensure the child’s safety over the holiday period. Reflecting on the decision not to intervene, the inquiry report says: “In light of the stark evidence of neglect, the lack of immediate action by children’s social care to initiate child protection procedures raises serious questions of professional judgment.” In January 2019, the child was admitted to hospital in agony, three days after her parents reported to social workers the girl had a swollen arm. X-rays revealed a broken arm, as well as multiple historical fractures in her legs. She was immediately taken into police protection and her parents arrested. Social workers had not lacked awareness of the potential risks to the girl, the inquiry found. There was, however, a lack of “management oversight”, which, coupled with frequent change of social workers over the three months of their involvement, resulted in the girl experiencing significant harm. Asked by the inquiry why they had not referred the girl to child protection earlier, the health visitors said based on previous experience they believed child protection intervention thresholds were set so high their referral would inevitably be rejected. The girl remains in care and, according to the Northamptonshire Safeguarding Children Partnership, “beginning to thrive with her foster carers”. Her parents, Sarah Elizabeth Cunnington and Ryan Eames, were each jailed for two years and seven months in October 2021.",News/Society,"Social workers failed to act quickly to protect neglected toddler, inquiry says",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/26/social-workers-failed-act-quickly-protect-neglected-toddler-inquiry-northamptonshire
4/26/2022,"A 108-year-old bus service linking Bromsgrove and Birmingham is to be axed because so many people are now working from home, a transport boss has said. The 144 service, which has run between Worcester, Bromsgrove and Birmingham since 1914, is being cut back at the end of April. The service will now run just between Worcester and Bromsgrove, which is 13 miles outside Birmingham. Nigel Eggleton, the managing director at First Worcester, which runs the service, said that “for over 12 months now, we have carried very few people” on the route, “resulting in us having to make this difficult decision to remove the link to Birmingham”. He attributed the decline in passenger numbers to the Covid pandemic, saying factors such as “people working from home, flexible working patterns, confidence in being around public places and the use of other modes of travel to get around avoiding congested places” have all had an impact on service use. He said the move was part of upcoming changes to “realign our bus network in accordance with how and when people are travelling across the working week and at weekends”. Local residents have hit back at the plans, saying many people still rely on the route to commute into the city, and over 2,000 have signed a petition calling for the service to stay. “It will obviously take a certain while before people get back to normal and into their place of work instead of home. But people are now slowly returning to the workplace and they’re relying on the bus to get there,” said Bromsgrove councillor Peter McDonald. “After 100 years of this bus route making a profit, it seems rather selfish for them to say it’s stopping now. It’s going to have a devastating impact on the people who do rely on the bus to get to work. It’s creating a lot of anxiety for people.” Earlier this month, research by the Campaign for Better Transport found that more than one in four bus services in England have been cut in the last decade, with the pandemic accelerating the decline. Services fell by 18% during the pandemic, compared with a 10% decline in the years to 2019. Eggleton said the operator was “working closely with Worcestershire county council and Transport for West Midlands to determine if there is any funding available” to maintain the service, adding that “we will update everyone with progress on these conversations”.",News/UK news,Bus firm blames WFH for axing century-old service to Birmingham,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/26/bus-firm-blames-wfh-for-axing-century-old-service-to-birmingham
4/26/2022,"Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has backed Elon Musk’s controversial $44bn (£34bn) takeover of the micro-blogging platform, describing the billionaire as “the singular solution I trust”. The 45-year-old, who co-founded the company in 2006 and floated it on the New York Stock Exchange in 2013, said it has been “owned” by Wall Street and that Musk’s deal struck on Monday to take it private was the “correct first step”. However, Dorsey, who stepped down as Twitter chief executive in November and will receive a $978m payout for his 2.4% stake when the deal is completed later this year, said that ultimately “in principle I don’t believe anyone should own or run Twitter”. “It wants to be a public good at a protocol level, not a company,” he said, in a series of tweets. “Solving for the problem of it being a company however, Elon is the singular solution I trust. I trust his mission to extend the light of consciousness.” Parag Agrawal, who took over from Dorsey as chief executive, has told staff that their jobs are only safe for about the six months it will take to get the deal done. “Once the deal closes, we don’t know which direction the platform will go,” said Agrawal, who is in line for a $38.7m pay package due to a “change of control” clause in his contract. Human rights groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch raised concerns that hate speech may be allowed to flourish after the change in ownership. Musk, who is the world’s richest person, has described himself as a “free speech absolutist” and has criticised Twitter’s moderation policies. “While Elon Musk is an American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) card-carrying member and one of our most significant supporters, there’s a lot of danger having so much power in the hands of any one individual,” said the ACLU executive director, Anthony Romero. Dorsey tweeted that Musk’s plan to create a platform that is “maximally trusted and broadly inclusive” was the “right one”. Donald Trump, who was permanently banned from Twitter after the US Capitol riots last January, has said he would not return to the platform even if Musk allowed him. Musk is said to favour temporary “time-outs” for users who breach Twitter’s policies, instead of bans. Musk sealed the $44bn deal to buy Twitter after a dramatic few weeks of speculation about the platform’s future, triggered by Musk’s emergence as its largest single shareholder on 4 April. He then declared a takeover bid on 14 April, offering to buy all Twitter’s shares for $54.20 each. At first, Twitter’s board seemed opposed, enacting an anti-takeover measure known as a “poison pill” that could have made a takeover attempt prohibitively expensive. But its initial reluctance to accept a transaction appeared to fade after Musk confirmed a funding package for the deal – including $21bn of his own money, alongside debt funding from Morgan Stanley and other financial institutions – and shareholders warmed to it. The Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, the world’s secon-richest person, has questioned whether China might pressure Twitter’s new owner to suppress criticism of the country on the platform. Bezos was responding to a post from a New York Times reporter who pointed out the importance of China to Tesla, which is run by Musk, including the fact it is the electric carmaker’s second-largest market. “Interesting question,” Bezos tweeted. “Did the Chinese government just gain a bit of leverage over the town square?” Musk called Twitter the “digital town square” after striking a deal on Monday. Bezos subsequently clarified his view saying that Chinese pressure was unlikely to result in censorship. “My own answer to this question is probably not,” he said. “The more likely outcome in this regard is complexity in China for Tesla, rather than censorship at Twitter. But we’ll see. Musk is extremely good at navigating this kind of complexity.” Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, said there was no basis to speculation that Beijing could try to use leverage over the electric carmaker to influence content on the social media site. ""He's more powerful than countries now,"" said Ross Gerber, a Tesla investor $tsla $twtr https://t.co/0sc0XOtOW4 Ross Gerber, an investor in Tesla described as close to Musk, tweeted that Musk is “more powerful than countries now”, adding Twitter and its hundreds of millions of users to a portfolio that also includes the aerospace company Space X. Musk has pledged to clean up Twitter bots on the platform, which has been used to attempt to manipulate big events such as political elections. However, Vivian Schiller, the former head of news and journalism partnerships at Twitter, fears that Musk may not realise the challenges of content moderation. “I think he may just not realise that the kind of decisions that are going to have to be made, ultimately rolling up to him, are incredibly complicated,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “It’s easy to say ‘I believe in free speech’, but what do you do when you’re talking about incitement to violence, hate speech or other forms of really troubling content?”",News/Business,Twitter takeover: Jack Dorsey says Elon Musk is ‘solution I trust’,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/26/twitter-takeover-jack-dorsey-elon-musk
