3/25/2022,"After two turgid Test matches in Antigua and Barbados this series suddenly burst into life on the opening day of the decider in St George’s. A carnival took place off the field and a procession of wickets took place on it, until the unlikely pairing of Jack Leach and Saqib Mahmood changed the story completely. At the close, as the band of steel drummers in the Junior Murray/Rawl Lewis Stand started to rest their weary wrists following three sessions of tropical rhythms, England had finally been bowled out for 204 when, with three balls remaining, Mahmood was castled by the part-time spin of Jermaine Blackwood one run short of a maiden half-century at any level. It was heartbreaking for the No 11, who had combined with Leach, 41 from 141 deliveries, for a 10th wicket stand of 90 runs over 36 overs that had arrested an alarming collapse from those higher up the order and driven West Indies to distraction. The pair had fought their corner and hustled runs with impressive composure, Mahmood top-scoring for his side in the process. Conditions had eased for the two tailenders in the final session, it must be said, certainly compared to the first two in which England subsided to 67 for seven after lunch, with six of the departed failing to reach double figures and the two Yorkshireman, Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow, registering ducks. At that stage their hopes of registering a first series win here since 2004 were in strife. This was a memorable opening day, played out in glorious sunshine and with good local support for a working day making for an engrossing atmosphere and a much needed change of narrative on tour. The pitch started out offering seam movement, inconsistent bounce and, through a combination of the two, a reality check for the batters who felt good after filling their boots during the first two. Root will have known things would be tricky when he lost the toss and Kraigg Brathwaite asked the visitors to bat while also announcing that his spinner, Veerasammy Permaul, had made way for Kyle Mayers; the thick set Barbadian is a batter but also a more than handy purveyor of medium-pace swing with knowledge of this ground from a previous time playing for the Leeward Islands. It proved an instant masterstroke when Mayers entered the fray in the 11th over and, after struggling with his run-up initially, knocked over Zak Crawley and Root in a run of five maidens. The former drove loosely to cover and the latter nicked off to one that nipped a fraction. Having bemoaned the lack of pace in county cricket after the Ashes, Root had been nobbled by someone who’d fit right in. When the more frontline Jayden Seales returned for a second spell, the Trinidadian trapping Dan Lawrence in front for a plumb lbw on 10, England went into lunch on 46 for three and had a bit to chew over as a parade of dancers, stilt-walkers and costumed revellers suddenly began circulating the boundary’s edge to the delight of visitors and locals alike. After this injection of calypso came the collapse, however, with England losing five wickets for 21 in the space of 12.1 overs – three coming with the score on 53 – as the West Indies pace attack feasted on their first opportunity all series to truly dominate. It was triggered initially by Alzarri Joseph, who cranked up his speeds beyond the 90mph mark to remove Ben Stokes caught and bowled and tickle the edge of Bairstow’s tepid defensive shot third ball. In between came the departure of Alex Lees who, after batting through the morning using the nous of a county pro in April, fell for 31 from 97 balls when edging behind off Kemar Roach. This was likely justice being served, Roach appearing to get his man the same way two balls earlier only to find his captain, Brathwaite, reluctant to review after burning his first two before lunch. There was less uncertainty about the dismissal of Ben Foakes, bowled neck and crop by the returning Seales with one that lavishly jagged back in and trimmed the bails. But from here England’s fightback began to form, Chris Woakes and Craig Overton initially chiselling out a stand of 27 runs before the latter was bowled by Roach to see the tourists reach tea on 114 for eight. Woakes, who has held his spot here due to Ollie Robinson’s ongoing fitness issues, had played his usual cool hand but lasted just two balls after the break. Seales repeated the trick that removed Foakes and likely persuaded his openers to start thinking about facing England’s new-ball attack. Few could have predicted what was to come and in a series being played out by two lowly teams, mistakes were always possible. These duly came when lives were handed to Leach on 10, dropped at slip by Mayers, and when Mahmood was put down by the diving John Campbell at cover on 15. The No 11 promptly launched the following delivery from Mayers for six and as the final session wore on, frustration grew for the hosts. England were never out of the match – as recently as 1897, Lord Hawke’s XI were bowled out for 138 on this island and still beat Grenada by an innings – but a challenge that at one stage looked as stiff as climbing the neighbouring hills had eased.",Sport/Sport,Mahmood and Leach lead England recovery after West Indies’ fast start,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/24/mahmood-and-leach-lead-england-recovery-after-west-indies-fast-start
3/25/2022,"The Rugby Football Union chief executive, Bill Sweeney, has insisted Eddie Jones is not “bulletproof” and belatedly admitted England’s Six Nations performance was not acceptable. Jones has been backed to continue in the role for now but Sweeney insisted his position would be kept under constant review. Sweeney went on to concede that the union was wrong not to acknowledge in its statement the day after England lost to France that another campaign with two wins and three defeats was disappointing and that supporters had a right to feel aggrieved. Sweeney also revealed he has had a conversation with Jones, spelling out that another substandard campaign was “not acceptable”. He said: “No one is bulletproof. No one is indispensable. I’m not indispensable. Anyone can go at any particular time but that happens when there is a loss of confidence. “People stay in their role because there is a belief that you are still heading in the right direction, even when, sometimes, the results might not back that up. You make a call, you make a judgment; are we heading in the right direction? Of course he’s not bulletproof. He knows that himself. We haven’t performed well in the last two Six Nations. To have a conversation with him saying ‘that’s not acceptable’ – of course that happens.” On Sunday the RFU released a statement claiming that “solid progress” had been made despite a campaign with just eight tries scored and wins over only Italy and Wales. The statement acknowledged no disappointment nor did it include an apology to supporters but on Thursday Sweeney said: “The feelings were genuine, really disappointed, massively frustrated. Should we have said that more up front? Yes, probably, recognising fans’ disappointment as well, so I think that’s a fair comment. “We weren’t lying. When we made that statement, we were being honest. ‘Solid progress’ – I can understand how that might confuse after two wins last year and two wins this year. But progress is not just about matches won. It’s also about hitting certain objectives along the way. “Eddie has said it himself, that he hasn’t done a good job. He said that in one interview. If you go back we won three championships with him since he’s been here. You only remember the most recent performances and the ones that hurt at the moment are the last two years. But do we think that he is the coach that is capable of winning us the Six Nations next year? Absolutely correct.” Sweeney insisted there was no cut-off point when it would be too close to the World Cup to ditch Jones but went on to explain why he was adamant he was still the right man for the job. “We review and evaluate things as we go along. It’s not a case of saying: ‘Let’s wait six months then review it and see how we’re going,’” he said. “We’ll continue to review all the way through, we will have those conservations and as long as we’re moving in the right direction, we’re happy. “[Jones] felt that the spirit in the side needed to improve and we needed to break down some of the club relationships and forge one England identity. We’ve seen that come on leaps and bounds. Another big one is leadership on the field of play. The other one is decision-making – maturity and composure in critical moments. We think we’re not there yet. That’s one thing that didn’t go well. [But] he’s got the absolute belief and commitment of the players. Given all of that, we believe he’s the right guy to take us through. We’ll continue to review as we go through.”",Sport/Sport,"Six Nations ‘not acceptable’ and Eddie Jones is not ‘bulletproof’, says RFU chief",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/24/rfu-bill-sweeney-insists-england-head-coach-eddie-jones-is-not-bulletproof
3/25/2022,"People in Wales will no longer be legally required to wear masks in shops and on public transport from Monday and the legal obligation to stay at home after a positive Covid test is to be scrapped. Mask wearing will still be mandatory in health and care settings, however, and businesses will have to continue to carry out coronavirus risk assessments and put “reasonable” mitigation measures in place. It had been anticipated that the Welsh government would keep measures such as mask wearing in many public places after saying earlier this week that Covid was spreading rapidly. But on Thursday night, the first minister, Mark Drakeford, said Wales was “firmly” on the path towards living safely with coronavirus. He said: “We have seen an unwelcome rise in coronavirus cases across Wales, mirroring the position in most of the UK. We have carefully considered the very latest scientific and medical evidence and we need to keep some legal protections in place for a little while longer, to help keep Wales safe. “Throughout the pandemic, we have taken a gradual and cautious approach as we have relaxed protections. We are firmly on the path towards leaving the emergency response to the pandemic behind us and learning to live with coronavirus safely.” The requirement to self-isolate will be halted and moved into guidance. A £500 self-isolation payment to support people will continue to be available until June. According to figures released by Public Health Wales earlier on Thursday, the seven-day case rate per 100,000 people is 424. There were two more suspected Covid deaths. The next three-weekly review of coronavirus regulations would be carried out by 14 April, when the remaining legal measures would be re-examined.",News/UK news,Wales to drop mask-wearing law in shops and on public transport from Monday,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/24/wales-to-drop-mask-wearing-law-in-shops-and-on-public-transport-from-monday
3/25/2022,"If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a gif is worth millions. The image file format has been a defining element of internet culture for decades, with glass-raising DiCaprios and mic-dropping Obamas facilitating self-expression in a faceless digital world. And we have one man to thank for all the jokes, snark and praise: Stephen Wilhite, inventor of the gif, who died last week, aged 74. Wilhite, who lived in Milford, Ohio, contracted Covid two weeks before his death, his wife, Kathaleen Wilhite, told NPR. A lifelong coder, Stephen Wilhite created the gif in 1987 while working at CompuServe. The compressed image files were useful at a time when internet connections dragged. “If you want lossless, compressed graphics, there is nothing better than gif,” said Sandy Trevor, who managed Wilhite’s team, to the Daily Dot in 2012. Wilhite “invented gif all by himself – he actually did that at home and brought it into work after he perfected it”, said Kathaleen Wilhite to the Verge. “He would figure out everything privately in his head and then go to town programming it on the computer.” It was his proudest achievement, she said. The same year, an update led to animated graphics. “I think the first gif was a picture of a plane. It was a long time ago,” Stephen Wilhite told the Daily Dot in 2012. Indeed, according to Giphy, the go-to site for gif seekers, it was this image: Wilhite worked for Compuserve until 2001, when he had a stroke. Meanwhile, gifs’ popularity took off, including on early social media sites such as MySpace. By 1996, the “dancing baby” image – one of Wilhite’s favorites, he told the New York Times – was plastered across the the web and attached to emails. In 2012, “gif” was dubbed word of the year by Oxford American Dictionaries. The next year, the New York Times called the format “the aesthetic calling card of modern Internet culture”. The next year, Wilhite received a Webby lifetime achievement award. Called to the stage, he maintained a poker face as he delivered an acceptance “speech” in an appropriate format: Wilhite continued to code for the rest of his life. He was also passionate about model trains, Kathaleen Wilhite told NPR, and the couple were avid campers; he “loved travelling”, his obituary says. Beyond his work and his hobbies, “he was probably one of the kindest, humble men you’ve ever met,” Kathaleen Wilhite told the radio network. “People loved him and respected his work, and that would mean more to him than anything is how they respected what he did … I miss him more than anyone could imagine.” Tributes poured in on his obituary page. “You changed the way we converse as a society, and immortalized countless moments that would otherwise be fleeting,” wrote one well-wisher. “Thank you for helping the modern world take shape,” wrote another. Giphy offered a tribute of its own, hailing “the simplicity of the format, the power of the looping image. We are indebted to the creativity and vision of Mr Wilhite.” For those who’d like to honor Wilhite’s memory themselves, there are plenty of gifs that pay tribute to their inventor. Perhaps even better, you can heed his unequivocal advice: pronounce it “jif”.",News/Technology,‘He helped shape the modern world’: gif inventor Stephen Wilhite dies after getting Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/24/stephen-wilhite-gif-inventor-dies
3/25/2022,"In the buildup to this game the premise had been that Wales’s biggest names would come to the party and how Cardiff and beyond will enjoy Gareth Bale’s otherworldly free-kick that set them on the path to a World Cup play-off final. At least Wales supporters will have a few months to shake off the inevitable hangovers, the final hurdle against either Scotland or Ukraine, originally set for next week, now not until June. Bale left to a standing ovation after completing more minutes than he has for the past four months altogether, his outlandish first-half free-kick teeing up a precious victory. Bale scored a vital second early in the second half before Marcel Sabitzer’s shot, deflected in via Ben Davies, halved the deficit. That proved nothing more than a consolation as Austria’s hopes of reaching Qatar abruptly ended. More than three hours before kick-off, this stadium was going through one last rehearsal. The national anthems could be heard as supporters, bedecked in replica shirts, filed out of the Ninian Park station and congregated in hope of better luck this time. Most vividly remember the pain of missing out on qualifying for Russia in 2018 after a playoff defeat to the Republic of Ireland here, and many Russia’s win across town at the Millennium Stadium in 2003. Some bargained on a different story this time. And then for the real thing. “Now is the time, don’t hold back,” roared the stadium announcer, rallying a partisan crowd. A raw rendition of Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau was spine-tingling, the interim Wales manager Robert Page close to tears. Some fans had already succumbed to the emotion that provided a warm undercurrent throughout. The key thing for Wales was that Bale and Aaron Ramsey were on the team-sheet. In that order. Page said it would be foolish not to start either despite both being thin on minutes since the last international camp in November. Bale had played twice for Real Madrid in that time frame, his last appearance a three-minute cameo off the bench against Paris Saint-Germain but how he would make light of those numbers. Harry Wilson was crudely blocked off by Christoph Baumgartner when attempting to reach Daniel James’s flick and the referee awarded a free-kick a little more than 20 yards from goal. Then arrived a great sense of expectation, an overwhelming appetite for the spectacular. Supporters cheered Bale’s name as he took a few breaths. Then, one by one, fans rippled up from their seats to prepare for lift-off, a mini Mexican wave of sorts. Bale was unperturbed and, after one last deep breath and four dainty, magical steps, he proceeded to curl an immaculate left-footed strike into the top corner, in off the underside of the bar. Bale slid, belly first, on to the turf in celebration and pulled the Wales crest into his mouth. There was pure elation in the stands and Ramsey embraced Bale as if he would never let go. Page leapt to his feet, mobbed by his coaching staff. A red flare billowed with smoke in front of an ecstatic Canton Stand. It was a goal that offered Wales a command they were until that point lacking. They were galvanised and energised, not for the first time, by Bale’s brilliance. Ramsey came close to adding a second goal five minutes before the interval but Austria’s Heinz Lindner made a superb save when the midfielder smacked an effort goalwards that was sneaking in at the near post. It could have been a very different picture at half-time had Baumgartner seized on an opening in the Wales defence with five minutes gone. Sabitzer slipped Baumgartner clean through on goal where he was faced by Wayne Hennessey in his 99th cap. Neco Williams dashed across to make a last-ditch block and Baumgartner’s strike, via a tiny deflection, looped up on to the crossbar. Until Bale’s imperious strike, Austria, all in black, were businesslike and appeared unruffled aside from when Ramsey, who made his first league start for Rangers last Sunday, went close to latching on to James’s cross at the back post. But they had no chance of repelling Bale’s wondrous effort. Aside from needing to adjust his topknot, a steely-eyed Bale strode back to the dressing room with tunnel vision. Perhaps he knew he would sink Austria with another dart. James had won a corner after a furrowing run upfield and Wales played it short. An attack that appeared relatively harmless culminated with Bale beating the crest on his chest once more. James swung the ball into the box, where Davies nudged the ball on to Bale. There was still plenty of work to do, an awkward angle to negotiate but Bale steadied himself and arrowed a shot into the far corner. Six minutes into the second half, Wales were in dreamland. Bale was purring, setting James free with a delicious outside-of-the-boot pass. But Austria would not lie down and halved Wales’s advantage when Sabitzer pulled a goal back on 64 minutes. The Bayern Munich forward drove inside and his shot cannoned off Davies’s foot to deflect past Hennessey. Wales could have restored their cushion three minutes later but Lindner foiled James after being threaded through by Wilson. With 70 minutes gone, James passed up an even better opening when he allowed Nicolas Seiwald to intervene after racing clear of the Austria defence on halfway. There was the odd late scare, Davies clearing a panicked shot in stoppage time but Wales held on to savour victory.",Sport/Football,Gareth Bale’s brilliance gives Wales World Cup playoff win over Austria,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/24/wales-austria-2022-world-cup-play-off-match-report
3/25/2022,"It will sting Steve Clarke that Scotland were just seconds from securing a seventh straight victory. Kieran Tierney’s second-half header looked like continuing momentum for Clarke before a rare case of poor Scottish decision making. Craig Gordon upended the Poland substitute Krzysztof Piatek, with the goalkeeper unable to block the same player’s penalty. Poland thereby snatched a draw they barely deserved, with the frustrations of those in navy blue endorsing their now lofty standards. That the match programme’s front cover was simply an image of the Ukrainian flag pointed towards abnormal circumstances. Hampden Park was supposed to stage a World Cup playoff semi-final between the Scots and Ukraine on this very evening. Poland were due to take on Russia. Events thousands of miles from Glasgow altered that landscape entirely. To their credit, Scotland and Poland came together when insisting on a charitable element to this friendly. Unicef’s efforts in Ukraine are to be directly assisted by funds raised from the fixture. Sometimes, football really can be a force for good. Ukraine flags were visible throughout the stadium. Poland’s situation was different to that of their hosts in that they will play to reach the World Cup on Tuesday evening. It was no surprise, then, to see Robert Lewandowski named among the substitutes here. There remains a hope – if perhaps a forlorn one – that Scotland can face Ukraine in June. If it isn’t crass to point as much out, given the human tragedy that continues to unfold in Ukraine, Scotland’s prospects in respect of Qatar and the finals remains wholly unclear. Clarke and his employers have been consistent that they will be guided entirely by Fifa, Uefa and the Ukrainian FA. Polish concern surrounded the enforced removal of Arkadiusz Milik, who limped off inside the opening half hour. Both teams had created chances until that point, in a match that was far from cagey. The atmosphere helped in that respect; Poland were roared on by a sizeable and vociferous support while Scotland fixtures, for so long grim and unpopular affairs, have become trendy again on Clarke’s watch. Che Adams stung the palms of Lukasz Skorupski from 22 yards as Scotland chased a breakthrough before the interval. Billy Gilmour forced the Poland goalkeeper into an even better save. As Bartosz Salamon was removed from proceedings because of injury before the break, the new Poland head coach Czeslaw Michniewicz had cause to question the football validity of this encounter. Earlier, Salamon had fired a free header wastefully over Gordon’s crossbar. Piatek, Milik’s replacement, should have sent Poland ahead within three minutes of the restart. Jakub Moder had split the Scotland defence with a terrific pass. Piatek, with time and space on his side, screwed a shot well wide of Gordon’s goal. Scotland, minus their captain Andy Robertson, were playing the more attractive football. It was not ever thus. Callum McGregor and Billy Gilmour provided midfield fluidity. Nathan Patterson, with just 45 minutes against Boreham Wood to his name since swapping Rangers for Everton in January, surely afforded Frank Lampard food for thought given his prominence in Scotland colours. Generally, it was fair to assume the scale of Scotland’s showing when defeating Denmark to round off their World Cup qualifying section enhanced already blossoming belief. John McGinn will contemplate whether he should have tumbled after rounding Skorupski from Gilmour’s through pass. Replays were inconclusive as to whether the Aston Villa midfielder was clipped by the diving goalkeeper but McGinn’s over-running of the ball halted what had been a promising Scottish position. Gilmour had sharply picked the pocket of Grzegorz Krychowiak. Piatek’s next opportunity was a glorious one. Poland broke sharply after Scott McTominay had stumbled over the ball on the halfway line. Piatek steadied himself and blasted a shot as beat Gordon; only for Gilmour to produce a terrific diving clearance. Gilmour has tenacity to match undoubted skill. McTominay, quite appropriately, was the first to hail his team-mate. Clarke introduced Bologna’s Aaron Hickey for what was a long-awaited full international debut. The teenager’s first act was to join in a group celebration. McGinn whipped in a menacing free-kick from the right flank, which Tierney stooped to head home. This marked the Arsenal man’s first goal for Scotland, on the occasion of his 31st cap. Tierney’s performances as a marauding left-sided centre back have been a key constituent of Scotland’s upward trajectory under Clarke. Quite logically given earlier personnel issues, Poland left Lewandowski sitting on their bench. Piatek, belatedly, took on the scoring mantle. Gordon vehemently protested his innocence but the penalty award appeared fair. Poland can head towards Tuesday’s final with spring in step. Scotland will play Austria in a friendly on the same evening; seeking to display a ruthless touch that would avoid the minor annoyance that transpired in the 93rd minute here.",Sport/Football,Piatek’s late penalty denies Scotland win over Poland on poignant night,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/24/piateks-late-penalty-denies-scotland-win-over-poland-on-poignant-night
3/25/2022,"Bruno Fernandes is close to agreeing a new Manchester United contract after a breakthrough in talks last week. Subject to final details, the midfielder will sign a deal to 2026 or more likely 2027. The midfielder joined United from Sporting in January 2020 on a five-and-a-half-year contract, with an option to extend for a further year, so the new proposal is less about extending his stay than increasing his pay after a largely impressive impact. The 27-year-old’s form has dipped this season but United, who opened discussions last July, regard him as a key part of their future and Fernandes is happy to commit despite uncertainty over who will take over from Ralf Rangnick as manager and whether the club will compete in next season’s Champions League. United held talks this week with Ajax’s Erik ten Hag as they continue their search for Rangnick’s successor and will speak to other candidates including Mauricio Pochettino of Paris Saint-Germain.
