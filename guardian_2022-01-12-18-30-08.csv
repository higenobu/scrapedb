1/12/2022,"Boris Johnson faces a make-or-break session of prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, with furious Conservative MPs awaiting his explanation of the “bring your own booze” garden party in May 2020. Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said: “He has an opportunity now to come clean to the British public, who are devastated by these allegations.  “What’s astonishing is the prime minister has had a couple of days now where he could have quite simply answered that question yes or no – was you there at this party? – and he’s refused to do that.” More than 10 Conservative MPs have publicly criticised the Downing Street gathering, details of which emerged in a leaked email from Johnson’s principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds. The Amber Valley MP Nigel Mills said Johnson’s position would be “untenable” if he attended the party. “If the prime minister knowingly attended a party, I can’t see how he can survive having accepted resignations for far less,” he told BBC News. “He accepted the resignation of his spokesperson [Allegra Stratton] for not attending a party but joking about it at a time of much lighter restrictions. I just think that’s untenable.” Many more Tory MPs are expressing anger in private, though some are prepared to await the findings of an inquiry by the civil servant Sue Gray into a string of parties in Downing Street. One former minister said Conservatives would be watching prime minister’s questions closely. “Off the back of that, you will get a very clear sense from colleagues about whether they think that is a sustainable position.” Several witnesses have said Johnson and his wife, Carrie, attended the gathering. The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, called for him to resign. “Millions of people obeyed the lockdown rules, often at huge personal cost. They missed funerals, cancelled weddings and said goodbye to dying loved ones on video calls – some on the very day that No 10 illegally hosted a garden party,” he said. “Boris Johnson has become a threat to health of our nation, and for the sake of the country still gripped by this awful pandemic he must resign.” The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, will emerge from Covid self-isolation to pose questions to Johnson in the House of Commons, after receiving a second negative lateral flow test. He is expected to accuse the prime minister of misleading parliament about his role in lockdown social events. The 20 May party – as well as a gathering on 15 May revealed by the Guardian – took place at a time when the public were allowed to meet outdoors only one person from outside their household. The government did not put forward a minister to answer questions in broadcast interviews on Wednesday morning. On Tuesday, the junior minister Michael Ellis was sent out to take MPs’ questions about the party, insisting most of these must wait for the Gray inquiry. Rayner said: “Of course Sue Gray has an important role in terms of the wider investigation, but we don’t need to wait for that.” She added that the Metropolitan police “could and should” investigate the event. The Met have said they are in discussions with the Cabinet Office about the claims.",News/Politics,Johnson faces crunch PMQs as pressure mounts over No 10 party,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/12/boris-johnson-faces-crunch-pmqs-pressure-mounts-no-10-party

1/12/2022,"“Smiling doesn’t win you gold medals,” the gymnast Simone Biles famously retorted when a judge told her to smile more. While that may be true, few would deny that life without smiles would be diminished in ways we can scarcely imagine. What do they mean to us? Does the physical act of smiling create joy, or the other way around? What happens if you can’t smile, even though you want to? These are questions that the distinguished American playwright Sarah Ruhl explores, with a winning combination of wisdom and erudition. Ruhl lost her smile for more than 10 years due to Bell’s palsy, which caused the left side of her face to be almost completely paralysed. The morning after she gave birth to twins, a lactation consultant remarked that her eye looked droopy. When she looked in the mirror, she was astonished to see that half her face had fallen. She couldn’t move the left side at all. That moment marked a profound shift in her life. “Before I looked in the mirror, I was the same person. After looking in the mirror, entirely different.” Bell’s palsy can be brought on by childbirth, although the link is not well understood. While most sufferers recover in weeks or months, Ruhl was one of the unlucky few in whom it endures.  At the time, Ruhl was on a professional high; one of her plays had just transferred to Broadway, and was nominated for a Tony award. She had been anxious about the impact of twins on her career (she already had an older daughter, aged three). Soon after they were born, Vanity Fair asked her to do a Tony awards photoshoot. Photographers yelled at her on the red carpet: “What’s wrong with you – you can’t smile for your Tony?” When she saw the photo, she couldn’t bear her expression of existential pain, and resolved not to be photographed again. “I felt inside a paradox: I thought I could not truly re-enter the world again until I could smile; and yet, how could I be happy enough to smile, when I couldn’t re-enter the world?” The personal implications were more torturous still. What does it do to her babies, she wonders, to look into an unsmiling face every day? Will they know that their mother loves and delights in them? She reads that mothers teach children empathy by mirroring their facial expressions. Will her inability to do so mess her children up? And on it goes, Ruhl’s ability to feel joy maddeningly limited by her inability to express it. She observes that joy is a profoundly embodied experience, and quotes Thich Nhat Hanh: “Sometimes your joy is the source of your smile, but sometimes your smile can be the source of your joy.” Ruhl makes many interesting observations on the wider significance of smiles, from strangers in the street demanding that women should smile, to the frozen statue of Hermione in The Winter’s Tale. But she wears her academic hat lightly, skipping easily from Shakespeare back to the chaos of her family life, in which theatre rewrites are cut short because all three children are vomiting. This is a book about far more than smiles: some of the most touching sections look back at Ruhl’s childhood, and the experiences that propelled her into theatre. The tale of a health condition is, more interestingly, the tale of the person it afflicts. The book takes gentle aim at the limitations of conventional medicine, with its stark division between the mind and the body. Like many people who live with chronic health conditions, Ruhl is forced to become part detective, part medical researcher, as she tracks down the people and therapies that work for her. But Smile is not just a medical memoir; it’s the story of a passionate and committed woman trying to forge a life that nourishes her creativity, her children, her health and joy. That’s a journey many of us can relate to – and this book serves as a welcome invitation to worry about it all a little less, and smile a little more.

1/12/2022,"The Los Angeles Chargers. Extra chances to see Justin Herbert doing Justin Herbert things should be treasured. Brandon Staley’s side was flawed – their run defense would likely have doomed them in any playoff matchup – but Herbert’s excellence would have balanced the scales, giving the Chargers a shot at causing an upset. OC  It would have been more fun to see Justin Hebert’s Chargers making the playoffs rather than the Pittsburgh Steelers (it’s a shame their head coach flunked the Prisoner’s Dilemma) but in all honesty, the current NFL postseason format is forgiving enough that any team that doesn’t qualify doesn’t deserve to. HF The Chargers and it’s not even a close second. It’s a shame Los Angeles couldn’t eke out the, uh, tie against Las Vegas because the NFL world deserves to see Justin Herbert and all his gifts in the postseason. Between Herbert, Austin Ekeler, Keenan Allen and Mike Williams, the Chargers have as explosive an offense as anyone, and their defense was starting to get healthy – though not healthy enough to stop Las Vegas on third-and-5 in overtime. Welp. MJ The Baltimore Ravens. They’re always a tough out, and their rivalry with the Titans has been something of a standing appointment these last few years. But their loss to the Steelers in the season finale means another year of Lamar Jackson having to hear that he can’t make a deep playoff run. If only he had been healthy … AL The Dallas Cowboys are loaded on both sides of the ball. But the Niners are just the kind of team that can give them trouble. Kyle Shanahan’s offense is still running the ball at will. On defense, they have one of the highest pressures rates in the league when rushing just four and playing coverage behind. Dak Prescott is a founder member of the Do Not Blitz club. The only chance to slow the Dallas offense: create pressure with four pass-rushers. The Niners can do that, and they can churn out yards on the ground, backing up Dallas’ ferocious pass rush. OC The Tennessee Titans are only the top seed in the AFC because somebody had to be, not because they were heads and shoulders above the rest of the conference. If star running back Derrick Henry ends up returning and playing like peak Derrick Henry, they should be a significant problem to everybody. If not, a one-and-done wouldn’t be shocking. HF The Kansas City Chiefs. The two-time defending AFC champions can make multiple mistakes during wild-card weekend and still top the Steelers. Beyond that, if Patrick Mahomes and co remotely resemble their first-half-of-the-season selves, a team that was turnover prone and shot itself in the foot with dumb penalties, they could see a divisional round exit. The defense has been astounding the second half, but did surrender over 800 yards in the past two games. MJ The Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Word is they’re a little thin at wide receiver … AL When you start putting together the perfect playoff cocktail, you start with three things: A defense that can pressure with four; a quarterback that can create magic on third downs; an offense that can hit three or four splash plays a game. The Cincinnati Bengals tick all the boxes. There are issues on the edges – their linebackers aren’t good enough; the running game isn’t consistent – but those are playoff wants, dependent on matchups. The Bengals have all of the championship needs. OC Do the Buffalo Bills count as a dark horse? Maybe not at the start of the season, but it feels like Buffalo’s stock has dropped after nearly letting the New England Patriots sneak in to win the division. However, the Bills ended the season on a relative upswing. An iffy AFC field and a Josh Allen hot streak could result in an unlikely Super Bowl appearance. HF Yes, the San Francisco 49ers barely squeaked into the playoffs but if they play like they did in the second half against the Rams, they can beat anyone. The stars will have to align. Jimmy Garoppolo will have to play mistake-free football. Kyle Shanahan will have to get creative with Deebo Samuel’s usage from the get-go. And the secondary will have to play the ball of their life against Dallas and any future opponents. MJ Have you heard? Derrick Henry, the league’s most talent rusher, is returning to a Titans team that locked up the No 1 seed in his absence. Be afraid, Chiefs fans. Be very, very afraid. AL Joe Burrow. The Bengals have a chance to string together upsets if Burrow is able to continue his recent hot streak. The Cincy offensive line isn’t good enough to consistently block playoff-caliber pass-rushes, but Burrow has a way of slipping and sliding out of pressure, of extending plays, and punishing defenses when he does so. OC Is it boring to say Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who at the very least is the most interesting player in the postseason? Rodgers has been the best player in football on the field and a lightning rod off it. You know your reputation has taken a hit when experts start spreading (apparently baseless) rumors that you will sit out the freaking Super Bowl. HF Aaron Rodgers. Rodgers hasn’t won a Super Bowl in a decade. He’s lost back-to-back NFC championship games. Nothing to scoff at for a pedestrian quarterback, but Rodgers is in a different league. With the No 1 seed and a ferocious defense, Rodgers has never been as well positioned to win a title. Whether he does could go a long way to determining his future, which could have a major domino effect on the league. MJ QAron (aka Aaron Rodgers). The Chiefs at least know they can count on Chad Henne to win a game for them. But if the presumptive league MVP goes down? The Packers’ title hopes will fall to Jordan Love – and we all got a glimpse of how that project is going when the Pack fell to the Chiefs in Week 9. AL Chiefs over Bengals OC Chiefs over Bills HF Titans over Bills MJ Titans over Chiefs AL Packers over Buccaneers OC Buccaneers over Packers HF Packers over Buccaneers MJ Packers over Cardinals AL Packers over Chiefs. When trying to figure out contenders, you have to look at the certainties. Two things are certain about the Packers: In Aaron Rodgers and Davante Adams, they have the surest connection of any quarterback and playmaker in the league; Rodgers does not turn the ball over. Those are sound building blocks. On top of that, you can add a fearsome pass rush, versatility at linebacker – which allows them to toggle to different looks depending on the matchup – and, if healthy and available, a true shutdown corner, the likes of which it’s tough to find elsewhere in the playoffs. There are concerns. Green Bay’s special teams unit is a disaster of doomsday-ish import; the team’s offensive line has struggled in protection for much of the year. But neither of those flaws has been enough to offset Rodgers’ precision and lack of turnovers. Green Bay steal possessions. And when they have the ball, they have the surest quarterback-receiver tandem in the league. Of all the contenders, they have the fewest warts. OC Chiefs over Buccaneers. How about a Super Bowl rematch with a different outcome? This season’s Chiefs have a better defense than the previous edition while the high-scoring offense is mostly the same. Meanwhile, the division-winning Buccaneers won’t have to survive the playoffs as a wild-card team. Look for the Chiefs will to dish out revenge in a changing-of-the-guard game: an erratic Tom Brady will show his age for the first time and Patrick Mahomes will clinch a Super Bowl MVP trophy before the fourth quarter has even ended. HF Packers over Titans. Tennessee will make a valiant run aided by AJ Brown, who has been phenomenal since returning, and Derrick Henry, the most impactful rusher in football. Unfortunately for the Titans, they will face off against the most impactful player in the game, who is way overdue for a second Super Bowl ring. The Pack were already well-positioned seeding and talent wise, and they have a strong track record of winning close games this season (5-1 in games decided by three points or less). Add in the possible returns from injury of left tackle David Bakhtiarti, cornerbacck Jaire Alexander and linebackers Za’Darius Smith, three of their best players, and the Packers are sitting pretty. MJ Packers over Titans. Again, if nothing happens to Rodgers, Green Bay should have no problem neutralizing Tennessee’s play-action attack on the way to claiming a fifth Lombardi trophy for Titletown. They’ve been the class of the league all season, and their record might actually show it if Rodgers hadn’t missed that Week 9 Chiefs game with … you know. A second ring, and presumably another Super Bowl MVP nod with it, might not change the conversation about the league’s best all-around passer relative to the GOAT Tom Brady or baby-GOAT Pat Mahomes. But it would promote Rodgers into that all-time great echelon just beneath it – where Peyton Manning, Ben Roethlisberger and co reside. It’s just a shame it all has to end here, as Rodgers seems bent on moving on from the Packers after this season.

1/12/2022,"Sainsbury’s is to make £60m more in annual profits than predicted after enjoying better than expected food and drink sales over Christmas as shoppers bought more champagne than ever before. The UK’s second biggest supermarket said grocery sales rose 0.8% in the six weeks to 8 January, excluding Boxing Day, when it chose to close this year, as more people dined at home as the Omicron wave of Covid-19 put a dampener on trips to restaurants and pubs.  Total sales slipped 2.4% over that period as the company said problems with the supply of technology, gaming kit and toys hit trading at the group’s Argos chain but Sainsbury’s said profit margins on non-food had improved as it had cut down on discounting. Online grocery sales were down 15% year on year but still almost double pre-pandemic levels. Sainsbury’s said it now expected to make underlying profits of £720m for the year to 8 January, up from £660m, with profit expectations boosted by the better than hoped for grocery sales, improved profit margins on non-food and lower than feared bad debts at its banking arm. Simon Roberts, the chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said: “I am really pleased with how we delivered for customers this Christmas. More people ate at home and our significant investment in value, innovation and service led to market share growth.” Sainsbury’s said it had seen its biggest ever sales of champagne, contributing to its best ever new year trade, while there was a surge in demand for last-minute online orders from Argos. The late surge came at the end of a tricky quarter in which sales at established stores were down 4.5%. Sales at Argos were down 16% in the three months to 8 January and clothing down almost 3% but Sainsbury’s said this was partly the result of a reduction in unprofitable discounting. It said full-price clothing sales rose 38%.",News/Business,Sainsbury’s toasts £60m more profits as champagne sales soar,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/12/sainsburys-toasts-more-profits-champagne-sales-soar
