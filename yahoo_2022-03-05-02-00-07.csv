3/5/2022,"Roger Stone, whose decades of political work have earned him a reputation as the Republican Party’s “dirty trickster,” played a central role in the attempt to overturn the 2020 election results and was the architect of the #StopTheSteal campaign, The Washington Post revealed Friday. The D.C. newspaper’s reporters gained exclusive access to video footage shot by Danish filmmakers for a yet-unreleased documentary titled A Storm Foretold. Clips of the film were published to support the Post’s assertions that Stone played the role of puppeteer in the crucial weeks after Joe Biden’s victory over Donald Trump. “We are relaunching Stop the Steal,” he told an associate by phone, after instructing them to gather news headlines that would cast doubt on the validity of the election. Will the Oath Keepers Founder Spill on the Jan. 6 Organizers? The footage also showed how Stone was quick to walk away from the chaos when words inspired action and the coordinated political campaign of lies led to its inevitable conclusion: Thousands of violent Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol building. A dramatic video clip shows a disappointed Stone packing his bags at a hotel to leave Washington as rioters descended on the seat of Congress. Stone, reached by The Daily Beast on Friday morning, pushed back and claimed The Washington Post story had “13 errors of fact.” “Any claim assertion or implication that I was involved in or knew about or condoned illegal actions at the capital[sic] on January 6 is baseless and categorically false,” he texted. “Those who stormed the capital destroyed a perfectly legal effort to delay certification or the electoral college for 11 days so that irregularities and anomalies in voting Airzona Michigan Wisconsin Pennsylvania and Nevada could be more thoroughly examined.” The Post story does not assert that he instructed rioters to attack Congress, but the sudden appearance of the “Stop the Steal” movement did, in fact, fuel widespread suspicion and culminate in the insurrection. When asked if he takes credit for resurrecting #StopTheSteal, Stone pushed back—but acknowledged that he came up with the phrase for another reason years ago. “No I coined the phrase ‘stop the steal’ back in 2016 as it pertained to the 2016 Republican national convention,” he texted The Daily Beast. Stone on Friday also took issue with some associations connected to his time at the Willard InterContinental Hotel, where powerful Trump loyalists held a “war room” to coordinate the attempt to buck the U.S. Constitution and illegally keep him in office. For example, Stone distanced himself from Elmer Stewart Rhodes, the founder of the Oath Keepers, the anti-government paramilitary organization whose members stormed the Capitol while wearing military gear and uniforms. One member of that group, Joshua James, served as Stone’s golf cart chauffeur and quasi-bodyguard shortly before the assault—and has since pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy, the most serious criminal charge yet used in Jan. 6 cases. Video footage allegedly shows James inside Stone’s hotel suite at the Willard. “I have never spoken to Stewart Roads [sic] in my life [and] Joshua James was never in my hotel suite,” Stone texted. Previous reporting by The Daily Beast shows that members of the Oath Keepers ultimately felt betrayed by Stone and other VIPs they were guarding during that tumultuous week in the nation’s capital—a friction that could be seized on by the House Jan. 6 Committee and the Justice Department, which are both investigating illegal activity connected to the insurrection.

3/5/2022,"Ukraine's Defense Ministry said its armed forces seized battle plans Russian troops left behind. The ministry said the documents suggested Russia's war with Ukraine would last 15 days. An invasion map, a table of call signs, and a personnel list were in the documents, it said. Ukraine's Defense Ministry said Wednesday that its armed forces had seized secret battle plans left behind by Russian soldiers. It said the documents suggested Russia's war with Ukraine would last 15 days. The seized documents were posted on Facebook by the ministry and showed the war plans of one of the units of the battalion tactical group of the 810th Separate Guards Naval Infantry Brigade of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, the ministry said. An invasion map, a table of call signs, and a list of personnel were in the documents, according to Ukraine's Defense Ministry. The ministry's Facebook post followed a similar disclosure on the social-media site by Ukraine's Joint Forces Operation. ""Thanks to the successful actions of one of the Armed Forces of Ukraine's units, Russian occupiers are losing not only equipment and manpower,"" the defense ministry said. ""In panic attacks, they are leaving classified documents."" The ministry said that based on the documents, Russia approved its invasion of Ukraine on January 18. The operation was meant to last 15 days from February 20 to March 6, the ministry said based on its review of the documents. Insider could not independently verify this conclusion. One of the documents posted by the ministry appeared to be dated January 18, a full month before Russia attacked — while another planning document of call signs for different units spanned the dates February 20 to March 6, with daily code-name changes for different Russian commands to contact each other without disclosing their identities. The documents did not appear to give any information about Russian forces taking any Ukrainian city. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his country's invasion of Ukraine in the early-morning hours of February 24. The full extent of Putin's plan to assault Ukraine has been unclear, but a former Russian deputy foreign minister told Al Jazeera that he had information that the Russian leader wanted to declare victory within a week — a goal that now appears extremely unlikely, with Russian forces having seized only one major Ukrainian city after six days of fighting. Ukraine's Defense Ministry said the ""final objective"" by these Russian forces who had the planning documents ""was to block and seize"" the southeastern Ukrainian city of Melitopol. ""That is why you should not trust when a prisoner of war is saying again that he or she came to the exercises and got lost! They knew, they planned precisely and they had been preparing,"" the ministry said on Facebook. It added, ""Our response to the Russian occupiers is the following: Keep leaving your vehicles and classified documents, they will be useful for our defenders and The Hague.""

3/5/2022,"Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., was rebuked by lawmakers from across the political spectrum after calling for the assassination of Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Is there a Brutus in Russia?” asked Graham via Twitter Thursday evening. “Is there a more successful Colonel Stauffenberg in the Russian military? The only way this ends is for somebody in Russia to take this guy out. You would be doing your country — and the world — a great service.” Graham was referring to Marcus Junius Brutus, who was among Julius Caesar’s assassins in 44 B.C., and Claus von Stauffenberg, a German officer who attempted to kill Adolf Hitler with a briefcase bomb in 1944 and was executed after the Nazi leader survived the blast. The Republican senator explained his reasoning by adding, “The only people who can fix this are the Russian people. Easy to say, hard to do. Unless you want to live in darkness for the rest of your life, be isolated from the rest of the world in abject poverty, and live in darkness you need to step up to the plate.” President Biden and other NATO leaders have been insistent about avoiding war with Russia, a nation with an estimated 6,000 nuclear weapons. Ukraine has so far held out against the Russian invasion that began last week, but Friday saw the shelling and takeover of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant and the continued siege of key ports. The number of Ukrainian refugees has now topped 1 million as the death toll in the country continues to mount. Earlier this week, a Russian businessman based in California offered a $1 million bounty for anyone who arrested Putin as a war criminal. Twitter did not immediately respond when asked if Graham’s tweets violated any company policies for attempting to incite violence. The comments received bipartisan pushback from across American politics, ranging from the most progressive to the most conservative members of the House caucus and many figures in between. “This guy was the chief apologist and enabler for an autocrat who called Putin a genius on the eve of invasion and sided with Putin over U.S. intelligence over his assault on American democracy,” said Ben Rhodes, one of former President Barack Obama’s top foreign policy staffers, referring to Graham’s defense of former President Donald Trump. “Seriously, wtf?,” asked Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. “I really wish our members of Congress would cool it and regulate their remarks as the administration works to avoid WWlll. As the world pays attention to how the U.S. and its leaders are responding, Lindsey’s remarks, and remarks made by some House members, aren’t helpful.” “This is an exceptionally bad idea,” said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. “Use massive economic sanctions; BOYCOTT Russian oil & gas; and provide military aid so the Ukrainians can defend themselves. But we should not be calling for the assassination of heads of state.” Graham’s comments even received condemnation from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who has been under fire for her recent appearance at a white nationalist conference. “While we are all praying for peace & for the people of Ukraine, this is irresponsible, dangerous & unhinged,” Greene posted. “We need leaders with calm minds & steady wisdom. Not blood thirsty warmongering politicians trying to tweet tough by demanding assassinations. Americans don’t want war.” Graham's comments were also noted by top Russian officials, with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S., Anatoly Antonov, calling them “unacceptable and outrageous.” ""It becomes scary for the fate of the United States, which has such irresponsible and unprofessional politicians at the helm,” Antonov wrote on Facebook. “We demand official explanations and decisive condemnation of this American's criminal statements.”",Politics/Yahoo News,"Republicans, Democrats slam Lindsey Graham after he calls for Putin's assassination",https://news.yahoo.com/republicans-democrats-slam-lindsey-graham-after-he-calls-for-putins-assassination-160000380.html
3/5/2022,"French President Emmanuel Macron held a 90 minute phone call instigated by President Vladimir Putin Thursday in which any hopes to call off the war were quickly extinguished. After hanging up, Macron–one of the few world leaders still taking the Russian leader’s calls—felt simply, “the worst is yet to come.” The call came as a cavalcade of increasingly crazy stories emerged from Moscow which signaled Putin was becoming ever more isolated and willing to lash out at Ukraine and his own people. In the Kremlin readout of the call, Putin promised the “special military operation will be fulfilled in any case,” referring to the invasion in less than accurate terms. “Attempts to gain time by dragging negotiations will only lead to additional requirements for Kyiv in our negotiating position,” Putin said. Macron, for his part, tried to convince Putin that his plans to “denazify Ukraine,” using vintage Soviet terminology, is “a lie” and “an insult to the history of Russia and Ukraine, to the memory of our elders who fought side by side against Nazism.” Putin, who denied shelling Ukrainian cities even as they were being bombarded during the call, was clearly unmoved by the argument. Afterward, an aide to Macron told reporters: “The expectation of the president is that the worst is to come, given what President Putin told him... There was nothing in what President Putin told us that should reassure us. He showed great determination to continue the operation.” The war, now one week old, has killed thousands of Ukrainian citizens and reportedly many more Russian soldiers, but the bombing continues as Russian troops—some not even military school graduates—continue to close in on the capital Kyiv. But as blood continues to flow on the battlefield, new information about Putin’s crazy world is truly terrifying. The Times of London reported that Putin was so secretive about his plans for invading Ukraine that not even his cabinet knew what he was cooking up after being told he only planned to recognize the two separatist areas. “This is fucked up. They are out of their fucking minds!” someone in the government told the Agentstvo news outlet. And those officials who threatened to resign over the invasion were met with a worse threat: treason charges punishable by hard labor. “Resignation will lead only to a prison camp,” one official reportedly said. Other reports from the battlefield suggest Russia had pointed its own multi-rocket launching systems toward the border town of Popovka in what was likely a “false flag” operation site ready to go off at any moment so Russia can justify its brutal onslaught. Bloomberg reported that if resistance by Ukrainians continues, he may introduce public executions in captured cities. Meanwhile, inside Russia, things are not much better as growing dissenters—including young school children—are being rounded up, beaten, and jailed. Media outlets are being stifled and it is illegal to publish the truth about the war or protest against it. And new legislation introduced in Russia on Thursday added an extra punishment: anyone arrested for protesting will be forced to fight in the invasion themselves. As one Russian expert put it, “What the fuck is happening to Russia? This is absolute madness.” Meanwhile, the list of businesses fleeing Russian territory grows by the day with Ikea and Volkswagen the latest to pull out. Still, gallows humor continues to lessen the weight of the fog of war. On Thursday, investigative group Bellingcat had the last word. After a Russian court fined the organization a half million rubles for not branding itself a “foreign agent” last July, the group now says that the ruble has crashed under the weight of sanctions, they will pay up, tweeting: “We will wait one week and then gladly pay the 10 cents.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

3/5/2022,"President Biden didn’t say much during his State of the Union address that would benefit older Americans in particular — there was no talk of Social Security or retirement security, and only one line about nursing homes — but what he did say about Medicare could make a world of difference to retirees if passed. During his speech, Biden said Medicare should be able to negotiate for lower prices of prescription drugs — a proposal that would combat large pharmaceutical companies and drastically improve the spending of retirees.

3/5/2022,"For military artillery crews, going against an armored vehicle well within range of that vehicle’s gun is the thing of nightmares. Vehicles are more armored, can shoot on the move, typically can shoot faster and are designed for a close fight. Artillery howitzers, on the other hand, are meant to lob shots onto an enemy position miles away from the front line. But in the desperate fighting around Kherson, Ukraine ― now reportedly taken over by the Russians ― in the very first days of the Russian invasion, a Ukrainian artillery crew may have faced off with Russian armored vehicles advancing on a hotly contested bridge outside the city. Though Kherson, Ukraine, fell into Russian hands on Wednesday, the defenders of the city, possibly including one brave howitzer crew, played a significant role in slowing down the Russian southern advance. On Feb. 26 a CNN reporter toured a bridge on the outskirts of Kherson, Ukraine, that just hours earlier had been the scene of some of the most intense fighting in the first few days of the war. The bridge was key chokepoint that, if taken, would allow the Russian military to cross the Dnieper River and into central and southern Ukraine. By the time Nick Paton Walsh and the rest of his CNN crew arrived at the bridge it had changed hands multiple times. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the city saw the toughest fighting in the first few days of the war. Though it is impossible to tell without eyewitness accounts or video of the actual fighting, CNN footage shows one Ukrainian 152 mm 2A65 Msta-B, a Soviet-style howitzer, appearing to be lined up facing the strategically important bridge head on, surrounded by impacts and two abandoned artillery shells. “Shelling continued back and forth, and through the smoke CNN could see what appeared to be armored vehicles on the bridge moving towards the Ukrainian side, although it was not possible to confirm who they belong to,” Walsh said. https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/ukraine/2022/02/27/russian-troops-enter-ukraines-2nd-largest-city-of-kharkiv/ Tactically, sending in U.S. howitzers to stop such an advance using direct fire would go directly against U.S. military doctrine. “The preferred defense technique against an armored or mechanized ground attack is for the battery or platoon to displace to an alternate position and continue the mission,” an Army manual on how to deploy a howitzer battery said. “Direct confrontation with this type of force is not advised.” However, Soviet-style howitzers, like the Msta-B, were designed with direct fire in mind, said Tim Heck, an Eastern armies scholar and a Marine reserve artillery officer said. The Mst-B comes with some forward-facing armor that modern U.S. howitzers simply don’t have. “If they are shooting thin skinned vehicle, no worries,” Heck said in a written statement. “Tanks would be trickier, but not unreasonable if the ammo load is right.” But even with the splinter shield in front, the Ukrainian crew likely would have been vulnerable to anything more than a light or medium machine gun, Heck said. Roman Fontana, a former enlisted U.S. Marine who has worked with the Ukrainian military, said the Ukrainian force tends to be creative in how it deploys old equipment often in need of repairs. “They’ll take weapons not for their intended uses and turn it into something else,” Fontana said. If a U.S. artillery battery was to perform direct fire, it typically would use every gun in the battery. The fact that only one howitzer seemed to be set up to take on the advancing armored vehicles may indicate the Ukrainian force had to get creative with limited resources. Fontana said the barrel on that specific cannon may have been too worn down to be used effectively for indirect fire. But it was still possible to shoot straight over short distances. “If you have a broken tennis racket that you patched together and fixed, you can still get the ball where you need it to go.” he said. Another possibility from the images is that the howitzer was attempting to withdraw when the vehicle towing it was taken out by enemy fire. Heck noted that the cannon did not have its trails dug in, indicating that the emplacement may have been a rush job and it was possible the crew retreated from the cannon before it was able to get a shot off. Eventually Russians were able to take the bridge and have now taken Kherson, according to The New York Times.  But the Russian advance in the area and in the rest of the country was significantly delayed due to the unexpected fighting prowess of the Ukrainian military. And possibly due to one suicidally brave cannon crew willing to face down a column of advancing Russian armored vehicles.",World/Air Force Times,What a Ukrainian cannon on a bridge might tell us about what happened there,https://news.yahoo.com/ukrainian-cannon-bridge-might-tell-142821144.html
