1/13/2022,"A new text was made public by the Jan. 6 select committee Wednesday involving Fox News host Laura Ingraham. She said Trump should discourage armed protests at state capitols ""given how hot the situation is."" Ingraham advised Trump's former chief of staff to get the boss ""on camera"" after the insurrection. Fox News opinion host Laura Ingraham once again appeared in records disclosed by the House Select Committee investigating the January 6 insurrection. A Wednesday letter from the committee to House minority leader Kevin McCarthy included a January 12, 2021 correspondence between Ingraham and Meadows in which the pundit gave communications strategy advice for how former President Donald Trump should handle protests planned at several state capitol buildings. ""Remarks on camera discouraging protest at state capit[o]ls esp with weapons will be well advised given how hot the situation is,"" Ingraham texted Meadows, according to the committee's letter. ""[E]veryone needs to calm down and pray for our country and for those who lost their lives last week."" A January 11, 2021 FBI bulletin warned of armed protests that were ""being planned at all 50 state capitols from 16 January through at least 20 January, and at the US Capitol from 17 January through 20 January."" And in the spring of 2020, protesters carried assault weapons into Michigan's capitol building in Lansing. Fox News did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment on the latest texts disclosed by the committee. Ingraham, along with a few other prominent Fox News colleagues, privately pleaded with then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to get former President Donald Trump to call off his supporters as the Capitol riot unfolded. Ingraham condemned the violence on-air during special coverage as the Capitol siege was unfolding and suggested the leftist group antifa was at least partly to blame for the riot, despite no evidence supporting that claim. At the same time, she privately sent an urgent text message to Meadows, pushing him to have the president call off his supporters. ""Mark, the president needs to tell people in the Capitol to go home. This is hurting all of us. He is destroying his legacy,"" she texted Meadows on January 6. Ingraham's January 12 exchange with Meadows was disclosed in the context of the committee asking Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to come forward with any information and documents he has in connection to the day's events, including his conversations with the Trump White House.

1/13/2022,"An Illinois judge had a shocking outburst in court Wednesday, kicking a prosecutor out with minimal explanation as outrage grows over the judge’s decision to reverse his own ruling on a teen accused of rape. “Mr. Jones, get out,” Adams County Judge Robert Adrian fumed as he ordered Josh Jones of the Adams County State’s Attorney’s Office to leave the courtroom. The Muddy River News, whose journalist was in court, reported that Jones was set to appear in an unrelated case but had apparently “liked” a Facebook post supporting domestic violence survivors in the wake of Adrian’s extraordinary ruling in the rape case . “I’m not on social media, but my wife is,” Adrian said. “She saw the thumbs up you gave to people attacking me.” He added: “I can’t be fair with you today. Get out.” Adrian declined The Daily Beast’s request for comment about the outburst on Wednesday, citing a Supreme Court rule that urges judges to abstain from public comment about pending or impending proceedings. Judge Grants Bail to 3 in Rape Case That Divided Rhode Island Town The move comes as critics slam Adrian for tossing out a sexual assault conviction for 18-year-old Drew Clinton, who allegedly stuffed a pillow in a woman’s face as he raped her at a graduation party in May last year. Clinton’s accuser, 16-year-old Cameron Vaughan, broke her silence Tuesday days after Adams’ reversal on Jan. 3. “I woke up at my friend’s place with a pillow over my face so I couldn’t be heard and Drew Clinton inside of me,” Vaughan said, according to WGEM. “I asked him to stop multiple times and he wouldn’t.” After finally pushing him off, Vaughan said, Clinton jumped up to play video games “as if nothing had happened.” Cameron Vaughan During a bench trial in October, Clinton was found guilty of one count of criminal sexual assault. But last week, Adrian changed his mind and sensationally declared the teen “not guilty” during a sentencing hearing. According to a copy of last week’s hearing transcript, the judge insisted that Clinton had a clean record before assaulting the girl, and had already endured “plenty of punishment” by spending 148 days in a county jail. “By law, the court is supposed to sentence this young man to the Department of Corrections. This court will not do that. That is not just,” Adrian said. “There is no way for what happened in this case that this teenager should go to the Department of Corrections. I will not do that.” Illinois has a mandatory minimum sentence of four years in prison for criminal sexual assault. But Adrian mused aloud that the nearly five months served was a “just sentence” and, apparently determined to keep Clinton for serving any longer, he switched to a not guilty verdict claiming that prosecutors had “failed to prove their case.” Adrian parenthetically said adults at the party were to blame for Vaughan’s assault. He said they abandoned their parental duties and suggested that sexual assault is what happens when parents hold “parties for teenagers, and they allow coeds and female people to swim in their underwear in their swimming pool.” Clinton’s lawyer couldn’t immediately be reached for comment on Thursday. Dylan Gonzalez Accuses Trey Songz of Raping Her and Details 'Unbearable PTSD' Vaughan’s dad told the Herald-Whig last week that his daughter “feels like she spoke up for nothing.” “Now she wishes she wouldn’t have even said anything,” he said. But critics joined her and her family in slamming Adrian’s comments during the sentencing and his sudden reversal. On Tuesday, a local domestic abuse organization said that “the judge apparently felt sorry for Clinton and not the victim.” “He blamed everyone except Clinton,” Quincy Area Network Against Domestic Abuse’s board of directors wrote in a statement on Facebook. Jones told the Muddy River News that Adrian threw him out of court Wednesday for simply “liking” the post on the group’s Facebook page. It also featured the group’s logo alongside text that read: “Hold rapists accountable.” The group has since obtained thousands of signatures on a Change.org petition calling for charges to be filed against Adrian for “abuse of judicial discretion and power.” The group said Adrian’s ruling was an “irreconcilable deviation from both the spirit and the letter of the law.” “If he does not have faith and consistency in his own rulings, there is no reason for the public to respect his continuance in the position of power as an authority of the law,” the group wrote. Jones told Muddy River News that he believed he had taken a “pretty benign position” in supporting victims’ rights. “We obviously have to and want to support victims in all cases,” he said. “I have not made any comment publicly, privately or otherwise about Judge Adrian and the decision. I’m not going to. That’s not my role.” Read more at The Daily Beast. Get the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox. Sign up now.

1/13/2022,"In spring 2021, US Navy destroyer USS Mustin was assigned to keep an eye on a Chinese aircraft carrier. Mustin tracked the carrier Liaoning in the South China Sea and made sure the world knew how close it got. The encounter and China's reaction have become a point of pride for Mustin's crew, a top US admiral says. A close encounter with a Chinese aircraft carrier has become a point of pride for the crew of a US Navy destroyer, a top US admiral said Tuesday. In April 2021, USS Mustin sailed within visual range of the Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning and then let the world know about it. The operation was a testament to the ""boldness"" and skill of US sailors, Vice Adm. Roy Kitchener said at the Surface Navy Association national symposium. And those sailors have reveled in the condemnation it drew from China, added Kitchener, who serves as commander of US Navy surface forces and of surface forces in the Pacific. Mustin was assigned ""to mark"" the Liaoning as the carrier and its escorts conducted exercises in the South China Sea, Kitchener said, ""so they went out there, and they approached the group, and the Chinese [cruiser and destroyer escorts] in the screen came out to meet them."" Mustin's crew ""realized that at some point all the Chinese escorts sort of backed off, which told us, 'OK, there's some operating restrictions that they had around the carrier,'"" Kitchener added. ""Mustin didn't have those. They proceeded on in, found a good station, and sat alongside taking pictures and doing other things for quite a bit of time."" One of those photos, showing Mustin's commanding officer and executive officer casually observing the Liaoning, quickly spread around the world and was widely interpreted as a message to the Chinese navy. In the weeks that followed, Chinese officials condemned the Mustin, calling its actions ""very vile"" and accusing the destroyer of endangering Chinese ships and personnel, which US officials denied. ""It was a good story in the end. At the time, we had to manage it a little bit,"" Kitchener said Tuesday, adding that Mustin's crew has commemorated the encounter on a uniform patch. At the bottom of the patch, alongside Mustin's initials and hull number, are the words ""non grata,"" Kitchener said. ""I said, 'Hey, what does that mean?' And they go, 'Well, sir, that is from the demarche the Chinese sent to our State Department that said, 'Hey, the USS Mustin is no longer welcome in the South China Sea because they're such a pain in the ass.'"" The incident was illustrative of ""what our sailors are trained to do,"" and the response of Mustin's crew showed they were unified around their mission, Kitchener said. Operating close to other forces is not a new experience for the US Navy, but run-ins with Russian and Chinese forces — whose conduct the US has at times deemed ""unsafe and unprofessional"" — have increased in recent years, amid US tensions with each of those countries. Kitchener and other Navy officials have said US forces should expect to encounter those forces more often and possibly closer to US shores. ""When we go out now on operations, whether it's East Coast or West Coast, Black Sea, South China Sea, we're there head-to-head with our adversaries,"" Kitchener said. ""They're there. They're present. And we're managing the risk, and our sailors are getting really good at it.""
