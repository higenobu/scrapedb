4/29/2022,"Only Liverpool have a better Premier League record in 2022 than Newcastle. After the midweek grinding down of Villarreal, a Saturday lunchtime trip to a bouncing, optimistic St James’ Park will be a test for Jürgen Klopp’s team. The hope in the north-east is that this can soon be a grand-slam clash between two of England’s leading lights, that Eddie Howe’s post-victory, all-hands photo opportunities take in wins over the elite. Time was when a player such as Bruno Guimarães would be under the microscope of the Liverpool transfer committee but a fresh big spender on the block meant his Premier League arrival was accelerated and may, in future, price him even beyond Liverpool’s reach. Tyneside to Merseyside was once a popular trade route, taking in Gini Wijnaldum, José Enrique, Didi Hamann, Peter Beardsley and Terry McDermott. The plan in Saudi Arabia and Amanda Staveley’s office is to end the days of Newcastle being anyone’s feeder club. JB Newcastle v Liverpool, Saturday 12.30pm (all times BST) In the 1960,s Don Revie had the idea to change the Leeds kit from yellow and blue to the all-white of Real Madrid in the hope of copying the Spanish side’s achievements. The Yorkshire club were languishing in the lower half of the second tier at the time but had lofty ambitions. Leeds can learn a few more things from Madrid for Manchester City’s visit, sitting between their two Champions League semi-final legs. Rodrygo and Vinícius Junior hugged the touchline to stretch the City defence as much as possible and utilise the space they found in behind, something the makeshift right-back Fernandinho found out to his cost when Vinícius bamboozled him before slotting home. João Cancelo will return to boost a side who needed to start an unfit John Stones at right-back on Tuesday but the Portuguese might still be made to suffer by Jack Harrison, while Raphinha could cause Oleksandr Zinchenko plenty of problems. WU Leeds v Manchester City (Saturday, 5.30pm) If Dean Smith was less polite and less of an Aston Villa fan, he might reasonably suggest that his sacking and replacement by Steven Gerrard has not gone well – though his time at Norwich, who he has been unable to rescue, does not prove that the Villa hierarchy necessarily got things wrong. Both clubs face uncertain summers, though Smith, with extensive Championship experience, will surely be given a crack at extending Norwich’s sequence of promotion-relegation-promotion-relegation to a further promotion. Meanwhile, Gerrard’s Villa have badly run out of steam, last week’s grim goalless draw with Leicester at least ending a sequence of four defeats. Villa are still not mathematically safe, though 37 points is likely enough, and a club who spent much of last summer acting like a big club – spending £75m and also trying to sign Emile Smith Rowe from Arsenal – are 17th. Smith was sacked in November with his team 16th. JB Aston Villa v Norwich, Saturday 3pm Arsenal enjoyed an exciting, uplifting win over Manchester United last weekend and are well-placed to clinch England’s final Champions League qualifying spot – which would be a decent achievement, all things considered. So to gripe feels slightly harsh – though no less necessary for that – because the hard work they made of beating a team so miserable they even lost to Everton did not speak especially well of them. Of course they were missing Thomas Partey and their first-choice full-backs, but even with everyone available, they do not look a centre-forward away from being a serious outfit, capable of more than possibly finishing fourth. Mikel Arteta needs to strengthen his squad this summer, and the reality is that his first XI needs more attention than he might have hoped – there are players currently in it who still need to convince him they are good enough. DH West Ham United v Arsenal, Sunday, 4.30pm Frank Lampard welcomes his former club to Goodison Park but he will have no time for sentimentality. The Everton manager has six matches to save his new club from relegation. They sit bottom of the table when it comes to away performances, having secured only six points on the road in 16 matches, winning just once . This makes their home games incredibly important – there have been seven wins at Goodison this season. The team showed they had the fight in them to survive in last week’s Merseyside derby loss, which will be some relief for fans who will need to be fully behind a team under such pressure. Early ambition to attack Chelsea could be just what the crowd require to boost a nervous squad. Points are needed and sitting back will not help against a side who have failed to score in just three Premier League games this season. WU Everton v Chelsea, Sunday, 2pm In some ways Antonio Conte is the least likely Tottenham manager imaginable: a driven, focused winner of substance and achievement, with little time for talented but insipid attackers – or, put another way, if you could look up the word “Spursy” in the dictionary, you would find his name listed as its antonym. Yet there is something more than a little Spursy about Conte’s Spurs, consistently flattering to deceive: just when it looks like they’re cracking it, they lose weakly to Middlesbrough, or Manchester United, or Brighton. For that reason it’s impossible to guess how they might perform against Leicester in a game they must win – primarily to keep their top-four hopes alive, but also because Conte is probably the best manager they could have, and they have far more chance of keeping him if they qualify for the Champions League. This makes Sunday’s game one of the biggest of the weekend, with ramifications not just for this season or even next, but for the next few in N17. DH Tottenham v Leicester, Sunday, 2pm After Brentford lost 3-1 to Manchester United in January, Thomas Frank irked a section of away fans, and Ralf Rangnick, by suggesting their team was “unbelievably lucky to win”. Frank is no respecter of reputations, not one to offer deference. Following last week’s goalless draw with Tottenham, he made similar, more supportable claims his team deserved victory. Having won 4-1 at Chelsea in March, he is entitled to believe another statement win at a Premier League citadel is possible. Particularly as Monday’s opponents are United. Their dreadful first-half display at the Community Stadium in January has turned out to be the norm rather than the exception with Rangnick, seemingly demob-happy, telling home truths that must unsettle the hierarchy and star players. With their high pressing and Christian Eriksen’s mastery of set pieces, Brentford appear custom-designed to be the latest visitors to triumph at Old Trafford. JB Manchester United v Brighton, Monday 8pm Seven points in three games under the guidance of the caretaker, Mike Jackson, has taken Burnley from staring down the barrel to being out of the relegation zone. The feelgood factor is back at Turf Moor following the sacking of Sean Dyche, which looks more justified by the day. One of the main beneficiaries of Dyche’s exit has been Dwight McNeil, who looks liberated since the departure of a hardened taskmaster. The winger has struggled for form this season, providing no goals and a solitary assist in 33 appearances, but he is finally making an impact. His last start under Dyche, against Manchester City, saw him replaced at half-time, but Jackson and his staff have rebuilt his confidence by telling him to express himself. He now has the chance to show all his attributes and a win at Watford could leave Burnley five points clear of the drop zone. WU Watford v Burnley, Saturday, 3pm That both teams have found goals difficult to come by this season would be stating the obvious. Wolves have scored 33 and Brighton 31 – only Burnley (29), Watford (31) and Norwich (22) have been so goal-shy and yet unlike that trio, neither Bruno Lage’s nor Graham Potter’s team have been in any relegation danger. Few would expect a deluge of goals at Molineux since both teams defend well, with Wolves’ concession of 29 goals behind only Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea. They are more offensive than under Nuno Espírito Santo, but Lage has had similar problems to his predecessor in introducing tactical variety. At this late, comfortable juncture, fans of both clubs will now look to the transfer window, where goal power might be sourced. There the wealth of Newcastle looms, though, with Reims’ young striker Hugo Ekitike chased by both Wolves and Eddie Howe’s team, and Brighton’s Leandro Trossard linked with St James’ Park. JB Wolves v Brighton, Saturday 3pm With Southampton and Crystal Palace sitting 13th and 14th respectively, Saturday’s game looks likely to go one of two ways: it could either be a thrilling goalfest, the teams committing to express themselves with the pressure off, or it could peter out into a dismal trudge through yet another 90 minutes, players and fans alike yearning to be somewhere else. Either way neither manager should be entirely happy with their current position, even if they are largely satisfied with how the season has gone – there is no excuse for being behind Brentford and Brighton. Consequently, Ralf Hasenhüttl and Patrick Vieira will be keeping a close eye on which of their charges are more inclined towards the first option and which towards the second, because to finish in a position more in line with their squad’s talent, the moxie to turn it on every week regardless of what’s on the line differentiates those worth keeping from those better off elsewhere.

4/29/2022,"Hundreds of thousands of cancer patients are putting their lives at risk by cutting back on meals, heating and other essentials as a result of the cost of living crisis, a charity has said. Macmillan Cancer Support said it was “hugely concerning” that large numbers of people living with the disease were having to resort to drastic cost-cutting measures to make ends meet. Some recovering from chemotherapy or radiotherapy are sleeping in cold bedrooms to try to keep energy bills down, while others are washing their clothes and bedding less frequently or skipping meals. The development is alarming because nutrition, warmth and hygiene are vital to beating cancer, experts say. About one in four people (24%) with cancer in the UK – almost 750,000 people – say they “can’t afford life at the moment”, according to research conducted by Macmillan. Its survey of 2,000 people also found that since December, nearly one in four (24%) have been buying less food or making fewer hot meals to try to cope with the soaring cost of living. In addition, with energy bills spiralling, 32% of people with cancer – 1 million – have resorted to wearing coats or dressing gowns indoors more to try to stay warm without putting the heating on. One in six (16%) have begun washing their clothes or bedding less – or not at all – to try to keep costs down. Lara Burwell, 30, who was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2019, said facing cancer and the spiralling cost of living at the same time was “the worst possible combination”. The former nursery manager from Somerset said: “No matter what cuts we make to save money, we straight up can’t afford life any more. “I have overwhelming anxiety as all the money worries add up, and on top of this I am so fearful about how our standard of living will affect my cancer recovery. We’ve completely cut out heating, which is horrible as my treatment means I get really cold, but even with that saving I’m not sure we can afford the rent any more.” Dr Anthony Cunliffe, Macmillan’s national clinical adviser for primary care, said: “At a time when people living with cancer need their health to be their priority, it’s devastating to hear the toll the cost of living crisis is taking on the wellbeing of so many people. “Nutrition, warmth and hygiene are all vital in keeping people with cancer well enough for treatment and aiding their recovery, and to hear that people are being forced to deprive themselves of these essentials is hugely concerning.” Cunliffe urged cancer patients with concerns or questions about the impact of the cost of living crisis on their health or wellbeing to call Macmillan’s telephone support line. The charity has seen a high level of demand for its financial support services over recent months, with calls about energy bills jumping by 87% compared with a year earlier. Christopher Jones, the energy team leader on the support line at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: “Every day we are hearing from more and more people living with cancer who are feeling the enormous pressure of the rising cost of living, on top of the extra costs a diagnosis can already bring. We used to hear about people choosing between eating and heating, but now we are hearing from people who can’t afford either.”",News/Society,Cost of living crisis forces UK cancer patients to cut back on food and heating,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/29/cost-of-living-crisis-forces-uk-cancer-patients-to-cut-back-on-food-and-heating
4/29/2022,"The head of the UK’s vaccine taskforce has been appointed to a new unit set up to help tackle the shortage in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) products. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, announced Madelaine McTernan will lead the new HRT taskforce. It is hoped the lessons from supplying millions of coronavirus vaccines rapidly throughout the UK can be applied to HRT product shortages, Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) ministers said. McTernan said: “We will apply the key learnings from the successful way the vaccine taskforce have procured life-saving vaccines during the pandemic to help ensure women have reliable ongoing access to these critical medicines.” The move comes as demand for HRT products in the UK has grown over the past few years, due to increased menopause awareness and GP confidence in prescribing treatments. HRT can help alleviate severe symptoms of menopause including hot flushes, night sweats, low mood, anxiety and difficulty sleeping. But DHSC says the increase in demand is also one of the factors causing shortages among a small number of products, including Oestrogel – an ointment containing oestrogen that is rubbed into the skin. DHSC says the HRT taskforce will work closely with suppliers to understand what is causing the issues. It will then develop plans to ensure both short- and long-term supply meet rising demand. The team will also work with the NHS Business Services Authority to gather data, with the aim of improving understanding of supply and demand as well as what is driving shortages. It will also engage health bodies to ensure they respond to the increased demand. Javid said: “I understand how much women rely on HRT, which is why we will leave no stone unturned to help make sure women can get the HRT they need. That is why I have taken decisive action to appoint Madelaine McTernan to head of the HRT taskforce … to build on the success of the vaccine taskforce to bolster supply of vital medicines to women across the country.” Maria Caulfield, minister for women’s health, said: “It’s great we’ve seen demand for HRT rise so much over the last year as it means women are accessing the right support. HRT can help women manage severe, sometimes debilitating, symptoms of the menopause, allowing them to stay in workplaces and live more normal lives. “I want all women to feel empowered to speak to their GP about whether HRT would be appropriate for them, and for GPs to feel confident in prescribing. “The new taskforce will play a vital role engaging with suppliers, stakeholders and across government to make sure every avenue is explored to ensure all women who want HRT can access it.” PA Media contributed to this report",News/Society,Head of Covid vaccine taskforce to lead new unit for HRT shortages,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/29/sajid-javid-appoints-hrt-tsar-to-tackle-shortage
4/29/2022,"Primary schools should no longer permanently exclude pupils, and measures of wellbeing should be included alongside exam results in school league tables, according to a report by the former children’s commissioner for England. The Commission on Young Lives, headed by Anne Longfield, argues that exclusions can be highly damaging to those affected, putting young people at risk of exploitation, serious violence and criminal activity. The commission calls for a ban on primary school exclusions from 2026 and for greater efforts by secondary schools to reduce exclusions, with all state schools in England having to report annually on the number of children who have been excluded or moved off a school’s roll. The report recommends that no school should receive Ofsted ratings of good or outstanding without meeting inclusion targets, while school league tables should include a pupil wellbeing measure alongside exam results. “Look behind the headlines of the tragic deaths, acts of serious violence and criminal exploitation of our young people over recent years and so often you see a pattern of children disengaging and falling out of school and into harm,” said Longfield, who stepped down as children’s commissioner in 2021. “Over recent years we have seen the growth of an exclusions culture that perversely rewards removing some vulnerable children from school roll. That must not continue.” Longfield said that while exclusions did not automatically result in children becoming involved in crime or serious violence, “we have met so many school leaders, youth workers, social workers, victims and perpetrators of exploitation, parents and children who recounted how school exclusion was a trigger point,” leading to involvement in county lines, gangs or sexual exploitation. “Five teenagers have been murdered in one London borough in the last year, and all of them killed by a teenager who had been excluded from school. Can this really be coincidental?” Longfield said. The report highlights the case of a boy suspended 17 times while in reception class. “A system that has no real accountability for a five-year-old boy being excluded 17 times in a year, or where a vulnerable teenager is out of school for months or even years, is not a system that is working for every child,” Longfield said. Department for Education (DfE) statistics show 1,067 primary school pupils were permanently excluded in 2018-19, accounting for 0.02% of all children at state primary schools in England. In state secondary schools more than 6,700 were excluded, or 0.2% of students enrolled. Tom Bennett, the DfE’s behaviour adviser, said: “Permanent exclusions are incredibly rare in primary school – they exclude on average once every 10 years. They are only used when absolutely necessary, to preserve the safety and learning of students. Anyone advocating otherwise, however well meaning, is inadvertently campaigning to endanger children and staff. “Would we insist a child who has been sexually assaulted by another child should have to remain in the school with their abuser? Of course not. Nor should we expect the school community to be exposed to that threat.” The report also recommends that the higher proportion of children from Black Caribbean backgrounds being excluded should be addressed through new guidance and curriculum content, with the DfE advised to work with school leaders and parents on the treatment of Black children over issues such as adultification. “The recent abhorrent treatment of Child Q, a teenage girl who was left traumatised after being strip-searched at school by Met police officers while on her period, is a recent shocking example of how adultification can happen in educational settings,” the report notes. Lucy Nethsingha, the deputy chair of the Local Government Association’s children and young people board, said councils shared the commission’s concerns and were looking to the Queen’s speech next month for new legislation. “Councils want to work with government to make swift changes to legislation to make the education safety net more robust, for the benefit of current and future generations of young people,” Nethsinga said. A DfE spokesperson said suspension and exclusion were “necessary and essential behaviour management tools” for schools. “Longer term, our recently published [special needs] and alternative provision green paper set out our plans to reform alternative provision, changing the culture and practice of how settings run and best support their pupils,” the DfE said.",News/Education,"Ban permanent exclusions from English primaries, says ex-children’s tsar",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/29/ban-permanent-exclusions-from-english-primaries-says-ex-childrens-tsar
4/29/2022,"West Ham vowed to take action after two German radio reporters were allegedly attacked by supporters of the Premier League club during their Europa League semi-final defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt. Tim Brockmeier and Philipp Hofmeister are understood to have been jumped on by West Ham fans after Michail Antonio drew David Moyes’s side level in the 21st minute at the London Stadium. According to reports in the German newspaper Bild, Hofmeister revealed live on air that Brockmeier’s headset had been ripped off and thrown to the floor. Hofmeister is reported to have said: “We are being attacked here. They threw the headset down on my colleague Tim. I have to sort myself out a bit. We have to see that we can get some security personnel here.” They are understood to have been moved to another position at half-time. Bild also reported that Hofmeister said during the broadcast: “You constantly have the feeling that something could come from behind, a punch or something. My dreams of English football have been shattered.” West Ham condemned the incident. A club spokesperson said: “The club is aware of the incident and will be working to identify the offender. In line with our zero-tolerance approach, anyone identified will have their details passed to the police. They will be given an indefinite ban and be unable to enter London Stadium and travel with the club. There is no place for this kind of behaviour.” The incident overshadowed West Ham’s first European semi-final in 46 years. There were fears of crowd trouble but it is understood that there were no clashes between supporters inside or outside the ground. West Ham were aware that their supporters had clashed with Eintracht fans in Seville last month and the club worked hard to ensure no visiting fans would be allowed entry to the home sections. On the pitch Eintracht deservedly took control of the tie before next week’s second leg in Germany. Ansgar Knauff scored after 50 seconds and Daichi Kamada scored the winner early in the second half. “Ultimately iIt’s a disappointing result for us but we’ve still got another game to play and we’ve given ourselves a chance,” Moyes said. “Hopefully we’ll play better in the second leg. We’ve got a lot to do. We’ve got to show a lot more quality than we did tonight.”",Sport/Football,West Ham to take action after German radio reporters ‘attacked’ by fans,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/29/west-ham-to-take-action-after-german-radio-reporters-attacked-by-fans
4/29/2022,"Ralf Rangnick is considering becoming Austria’s head coach, with the Manchester United interim manager to continue as a consultant to the club if he accepts. If the 63-year-old does take the national team job Rangnick could be confirmed in the role this week. After United’s 1-1 draw with Chelsea, he was asked about taking charge of Austria. “I’d like to speak tonight about Man United and our game and the rest of the season. I can definitely confirm that I will continue at the end of this season with my consultancy role,” said Rangnick. “I wouldn’t say I would be a big part moving forward, but we have agreed on the content and time of my consultancy role though as I have said I haven’t spoken to Erik [ten Hag, the incoming manager] yet. I’m more than happy and willing to help and change things for the better. “It would leave space for another job but that was what we agreed when I started the job in November. Tonight is the Chelsea game and let us speak about that.” Cristiano Ronaldo’s 23rd goal of the season cancelled out Marcos Alsono’s opener. While Chelsea now have 66 points after 33 games and are third, six points ahead of fourth-placed Arsenal, United are sixth with 55, five behind the Gunners. Wins in United’s final three games – against Brentford, Brighton and Crystal Palace – will mean they would equal their lowest ever Premier League points total of 64 points, of the 2013-14 season, under David Moyes. Asked about avoiding a new low, Rangnick said: “It was overall a difficult season. We could have quite a few more points, I wouldn’t say easily but realistically we should have more. We dropped out of the Champions League against Atlético Madrid and it was a massive blow with regard to not only confidence but also energy and that is why it is important we showed a reaction [tonight] against one of the best three teams in England.” Rangnick is unsure if Ronaldo will remain at the club. “This is something that we should speak about between Erik and the board and myself. Cristiano has another year of contract, it is also important to find out what he wants, if he wants to stay.” Thomas Tuchel’s team missed a series of chances to beat United. “It was a little bit frustrating,” the Chelsea manager said.",Sport/Football,Rangnick to stay at Manchester United even if he becomes Austria’s head coach,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/28/ralf-rangnick-to-stay-at-manchester-united-even-if-he-becomes-austrias-head-coach
