5/20/2022,"Despite bitcoin’s violent sell off, Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor is holding firm. The bitcoin bull said he’s in it for the long term and his strategy is to buy and hold the cryptocurrency. “There's no price target,” Saylor told Yahoo Finance Live. “I expect we'll be buying bitcoin at the local top forever. And I expect bitcoin is going to go into the millions. So we're very patient. We think it's the future of money.” Saylor said bitcoin has sold off with other risk assets like stocks as the Federal Reserve has moved to raise interest rates, and investors have sold off riskier assets or assets with valuations that had soared. That, Saylor said, is separate from the meltdown of stablecoin TerraUSD and its sister token Luna, which he thinks will accelerate efforts to regulate stablecoins and security tokens. “That’ll be good for the industry,” he said. “Over time, I think as people get educated and as they get more comfortable, I think we'll recover from this drawdown.” On the back of the meltdown in Terra, Saylor said regulators are going to accelerate their regulation of stablecoins and crypto security tokens and that the winner will ultimately be bitcoin. “Once people figure out why bitcoin is superior to everything else, then the institutions are going to come in with large sums of money, and we're not going to have to struggle through this massive explanation of why we're different than 19,000 other crypto tokens,” he said. Saylor also thinks that since most cryptocurrencies aren’t registered securities, that’s preventing public companies and investors from investing in them and holding back the asset class as a whole. While Saylor believes bitcoin is the future of money, he thinks Lightning—a network applied to bitcoin that enables the cryptocurrency to scale up its ability to do transactions more efficiently— is the future of payments. “If you're going to do payments and transactions high speed, you're going to need a base layer that's ethically sound, economically sound, and technically sound,” he said. “That's what Bitcoin is. But then billions and billions of transactions are going to go on a layer 2 like Lightning.” Jennifer Schonberger covers cryptocurrencies and policy for Yahoo Finance. Follow her at @Jenniferisms.

5/20/2022,"Russian soldiers are apparently so sick of Vladimir Putin’s “stupid” war in Ukraine that they are now openly plotting with their own commanders to go AWOL. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s Main Intelligence Directorate released a recording on Thursday that is said to show precisely that happening, with a soldier heard in a purportedly intercepted phone call detailing the plan. The soldier, identified by Ukrainian intelligence as one of many men “mobilized” by authorities in occupied Donetsk, complains that he and others in his battalion are so under-equipped that even the Chechen forces fighting alongside them mock them as “meat.” “Everyone who is here … I’m telling you … everyone is planning to take off on the 26th,” the purported soldier says. “Isn’t that stupid?” says the other man, apparently a relative back home. “Isn’t it stupid that we’re here?” the unnamed soldier shoots back. He goes on to explain that the troops have decided to abscond “on the basis of the fact that they put us on the front with absolutely nothing.” Russia Uses Ukraine’s Azovstal POWs in Demented New Propaganda Plot “I want to tell you even more. A commander is leaving with us and even a staff colonel,” he says, adding that they made the decision to flee on the advice of a lawyer. “They don’t provide us with any [equipment],” he says, adding that the rifles given to snipers are “from 1945.” Other units “look at them and go, ‘holy shit, what would you need those for?’ They laugh at us. You know what they call us? Blessed. We ask, ‘Why blessed?’ They say because we are walking around with no equipment, no helmets, without anything. … The Chechens call us meat.” “It’s not desertion, because we shouldn’t be on this territory. … We crossed the border as 200s,” he says, using a Russian military term for those killed in battle. “We’re not actually here. So if they say I’m a deserter, fuck off, I’m not here. Prove otherwise.” Other Russian soldiers are said to have taken equally drastic measures to get themselves out of the war. Ukrainian intelligence has released several recordings in recent days that purportedly show Russian soldiers resorting to injuring themselves in an effort to get pulled from the war. On Thursday, Ukraine’s Security Service released another recording said to reveal that trend. In the purportedly intercepted call between two Russian soldiers, one of the men tells his friend that fighting is getting more and more intense by the day, and despite daily fatalities, the military leadership is not providing backup. “Take someone else’s weapon, a Ukrainian one, and shoot yourself in the legs,” his friend advises.

5/20/2022,"Payton Gendron recorded his plans to carry out the racial massacre in East Buffalo for months in a chat on the Discord social media platform, reports show. Just 30 minutes before the white supremacist fired his first set of rounds in the Tops Friendly Markets in the Black neighborhood Saturday, he invited a small group of people to the private chat room to see his plans. Gendron’s goal was to kill three dozen Black people, he said in the messages. No one in the chatroom alerted authorities, according to reports. He killed 10 Black people on Saturday. “What we know at this time is that a private, invite-only server was created by the suspect to serve as a personal diary chat log,” Discord officials said in a statement. “Approximately 30 minutes prior to the attack, however, a small group of people were invited to and joined the server. Before that, our records indicate no other people saw the diary chat log in this private server.” Gendron also live streamed the shooting rampage and posted a 180-page manifesto online. The Washington Post reviewed 672 pages of Discord messages posted by someone with the same handle used by Gendron on other social media platforms. The messages included selfies of the suspect. The paper also verified a speeding ticket that Gendron mentioned he received. The user referenced Gendron’s mental health evaluation last June, which was recorded by New York State Police, according to reports. The 18-year-old said in the messages he lied when he told medical evaluators his threat to commit a murder-suicide when he graduated high school was a joke. He believed the decision allowed him to stay off the FBI’s radar. “It was not a joke,” he said in the Discord messages. “I wrote that down because that’s what I was planning to do.” On April 29, a copy of the first installment of the Gendron’s message was uploaded on the file-hosting platform MediaFire. The Washington Post reported that it was not available to download until Monday. The second batch of messages was posted on Thursday. MediaFire has removed the document and disabled the account. The platform’s chief executive said the records would be kept for law enforcement. “This is where I’m gonna end it, thanks for the fun,” the last message says. The records on Discord go back as far as November, according to reports. They show that Gendron vowed in December to kill “replacers.” He selected the Tops store in Buffalo by February after considering attacking sites in Rochester. He also planned on targeting two other spots in Buffalo. According to reports, the assailant estimated how many Black people he could kill between each location and worked out the distance and how much time he would need for each shooting. The messages also revealed that the assailant considered carrying on the rampage at a Black school or church but changed his mind. “I would consider breaking into a Buffalo elementary school, but those places are locked up tight, plus I get a strange feeling when thinking avout massacreing children,” he wrote. In addition to those killed, three people were injured in the attack on Saturday before police officers arrested Gendron. Witnesses said he had taken off his tactical gear and turned the gun to his neck before police took him down. A portion of a live stream of the attack showed Gendron paused after pointing his assault rifle at a white man in the store to apologize, and walked away. A longer version of the video showed Gendron had already shot about four or five people, shooting one woman on the floor twice. The white supremacist journaled three visits to the Tops store on March 8 where a security guard confronted him. He told the guard he was “collecting consensus data,” according to reports. In addition to two security guards, he counted 53 Black people in the supermarket that day and six white people. Gendron also feared that his parents would uncover his plan. He wrote about hiding his guns in his bedroom and clothes in his car. The suspect said he bought and sold silver coins to acquire the ammunition for the massacre. When Gendron’s parents saw a speeding ticket from his reconnaissance visit to the store 200 miles away from his home, he told his father on March 26 that he skipped school to go on a hike at a state park, according to reports. Gendron had secretly dropped out of community college, however. Fearing that his parents could have caught on to his plan, Gendron wrote that he wished he had launched the attack right away “My parents know little about me,” he wrote on Feb. 22. “They don’t know about the hundreds of silver ounces I’ve had, or the hundreds of dollars I’ve spent on ammo. They don’t know that I spent close to $1000 on random military s—. They don’t even know I own a shotgun or an AR-15, or illegal magazines.”",U.S./Atlanta Black Star,‘It Was Not a Joke’: Buffalo Massacre Suspect Shared Five Months’ Worth of Plans with Group 30 Minutes Before Attack — No One Alerted Authorities,https://news.yahoo.com/not-joke-buffalo-massacre-suspect-123000787.html
5/20/2022,"Reality TV couple Julie and Todd Chrisley are on trial for bank fraud and tax evasion in Atlanta. Prosecutors said they ""burned through"" money on a lifestyle outside their budget. Their lawyer said the fraud was committed by a former employee who reported the couple to the FBI. Todd and Julie Chrisley lived an extravagant, reality-TV-worthy lifestyle that was built on lies, according to prosecutors. In her opening statement on Tuesday, Assistant US Attorney Annalise Peters said that the couple — best known for their USA Network reality series ""Chrisley Knows Best"" — submitted fake documents exaggerating their wealth to banks to borrow more than $30 million that they ""burned"" on luxury items while also hiding money from the IRS. ""They made up documents and they lie through their teeth to get whatever they want, whenever they want it,"" Peters told the jury. On Tuesdsay, Todd Chrisley and his wife, Julie, sat in a 17th-floor Atlanta federal courtroom, where they are on trial for bank fraud and tax evasion. Two of their children, Savannah and Chase Chrisley, were also in the courtroom Tuesday. Cheryl Eisen is the go-to luxury-apartment stager in the New York area. She stages a penthouse in NoHo that was originally listed at $16.5 million. Her job is especially important this year because the luxury real estate market has been struggling, and homes have been sitting on the market for an average of 450 days before selling. This could mean thousands of dollars for a seller in maintenance fees, interest on loans, and more. Julie Chrisley was also charged with one count of wire fraud and one count of obstruction of justice on accusations that she inflated her income to rent a $13,000-a-month California home that she didn't pay the rent on and manipulated documents provided during the federal investigation. The Chrisley's accountant, Peter Tarantino, is charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and two counts of willfully filing false tax returns. The Chrisleys have denied all the charges, and their lawyer has blamed all bank fraud and tax evasion on a former employee, Mark Braddock, who eventually turned in the couple to the FBI. Todd Chrisley's attorney, Bruce H. Morris, said in his opening statement that Braddock committed the fraud — while impersonating Todd Chrisley — without the couple's knowledge, and then turned on them when he was fired in 2012. Braddock was ""obsessed"" with Todd Chrisley and ""wanted to be"" him, buying homes and furniture to live a lifestyle that mimicked his, Morris said. An attorney for Tarantino said that his client was an accountant who failed the CPA exam many times over 20 years and was unqualified to handle the Chrisleys' finances. Tarantino is a procrastinator who was ""in over his head"" but not a criminal, his attorney said. Peters said in her opening that Braddock was a ""fraudster."" He was offered immunity for his participation and admitted to his crimes, as well as the specific instances of fraud committed by the couple, which was then backed up with other evidence. But the couple continued to commit fraud, Peters said, even after they cut all ties with Braddock. ""They were dead to each other,"" she said of Braddock and the Chrisleys. Todd Chrisley initially made his money by buying homes, fixing them up, decorating them, and selling them for a profit, Peters said. And for a while, he was successful at that. From 2007 to 2012, the business was doing well, but the couple was spending more than they were making, Peters said. They ""burned through"" money on luxury cars, designer clothes, and a lifestyle outside their budget, she said. To get even more, the couple, and Braddock, began a scheme they called ""scrapbooking,"" which involved piecing together parts of various documents when applying for personal loans to make it look like they had more money than they did. They ""targeted"" over a dozen community banks with their schemes, believing those smaller branches would be less scrupulous, Peters said. In one case, a statement appeared to show that Todd Chrisley had $4 million in an account, when he never had more than $20,000 in that account. They used new loans to make payments on old loans, until they could no longer get more loans, she said. When that happened, Todd Chrisley claimed bankruptcy in 2012 — walking away from $20 million in unpaid loans and putting a hold on the collection of $500,000 he owed on his 2009 taxes, Peters said. Not long after, the couple got their reality-show deal. From 2013 to 2016, the couple made $6 million from ""Chrisley Knows Best,"" a reality show which chronicled the extravagant lifestyle of the couple and their children. They attempted to hide the money by opening a side company, 7C's Production, and had paychecks deposited there, Peters said. Julie Chrisley was the president of that company until March 7, 2017 — a day after she learned that the FBI was investigating them. After the family had moved from Atlanta to Nashville, Julie Chrisley went to a local Bank of America branch and put 7C's Production in Todd Chrisley's mother's name. ""All along, the goal was to hide the money,"" Peters said. On Tuesday, prosecutors called three witnesses: a talent manager who helped the Chrisley family get social-media endorsement deals, a Nashville Bank of America supervisor who was familiar Julie Chrisley and the 7C's account, and an IRS investigator. The trial, which will continue Wednesday, is expected to last four weeks.
