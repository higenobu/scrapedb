2/24/2022,"Afamous Russian independent journalist called me for a quote after Russia launched airstrikes all over Ukraine. We have never met but she started begging for forgiveness for what her country is doing and may do to mine. Both of us are experienced reporters, who are used to covering hard stories, conflicts. We talked, and we cried. So it begins. 5am. Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odessa, and all along the 2,000km-long Russian-Ukrainian border.  I am in touch with friends and colleagues all over the country who are awake and hearing the explosions. A possible attack on 24 February was mentioned by the government before. A few hours before, in the middle of night, my husband, also a journalist, but not a war correspondent, decided to drive to the office of the friendwho is on duty to pick up bulletproof vests “before it starts”. What, where? I have reported on the war before, so I am used to the sound of shelling. I know that a loud bang, a missile, a military explosion can be heard from far away. While trying to identify places and directions, it looked as if Russia was hitting military targets and military airports, which Ukraine’s president later confirmed. He also said Ukrainian air defence was working. Prior to this morning’s full attack, I heard from the military about a particular object to be targeted in Kramatorsk and near Kharkiv if things happen. This knowledge calmed me down. It led me to believe the army knew what to expect. I was one of those who until the very last moment could not accept the notion of a full-scale invasion, with airstrikes on our major towns. Putin’s speech was sickening but still there was a logical, if fictional, justification for a limited Russian operation. The full-scale attack on Ukraine destroys even that. I am talking to people, doing interviews, but in between I am packing and drawing water into buckets – just in case. I said to my husband – who has never been to war – do not go out on the balcony. He jokes: finally he will be allowed to smoke inside. I run a media organisation, I am not supposed to do breaking news. But now I have to. It’s my choice but feels like a duty. I received messages from friends abroad, from as far away as Chile, asking should I really keep reporting? Just a day before I cancelled a prestigious fellowship in Vienna to go to the eastern frontline instead. I covered the conflict there for eight years. For me, there is only one place to be. I read messages and receive news that other towns are under assault and slowly more clarity emerges. Some of the news about Russian marines in Odessa turned out to be untrue. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who a few hours earlier recorded an emotional speech in Russian to Russian citizens urging them to stop the war, issued a new statement. He made a reference to a famous anti-military song from the second world war: “Do Russians Want War?” and added “The answer is on you”. In the new one-minute statement he urged us to stay at home, don’t rush, but be strong. At 6.30am, in between everything, I send a message to the people with whom we should have gathered for an event today – human rights defenders, some MPs and officials. It’s a one-word message: “cancelled”. Each of them is awake and we give and offer support. I feel very emotional. We hear messages of possible air attacks. Yet the rest of the city remains calm. We hear the sound of police, but not military sirens. The parochial continues. Journalists write that subway still works, while many decide to drive to the western part of the country. The Ukrainian railways inform us that trains going west are running. I told my Russian journalist friend about our mood. For years I have been reluctant to compare any dictator to Hitler, or any war to the second world war. The comparison, to me, seemed exaggerated, even vulgar. But what other analogy is there. With no reason, in an act of pure madness, an old-fashioned air assault has been inflicted on a neighbouring country. I said that to my Russian colleague, and tried very hard not to show how my voice was trembling. She asked for forgiveness again. There is a famous phrase “4am Kyiv is bombed”. Every Ukrainian and Russian kid knows it. That’s how the announcement of the German bombardment of Kyiv in 1941 sounded. And here we are: 24 February 5am Kyiv is bombed by Russia. I am happy to hang up my call. I do not want my fellow journalist to hear me crying. And then my sister calls. I knew she would, it’s me the family and my mother turn to when there is trouble or they need to know what is going on. For two-and-a-half hours from the start of the invasion, they were sleeping. I didn’t dare call them. I really didn’t want to. I wanted to prolong the peace for them, if only for a few hours.

2/24/2022,"The stories of the Northern Irish writer Wendy Erskine, though colloquial and streetwise, are largely traditional in approach. She doesn’t mess the reader around. There are no games or tics, unless you count a taste for the adjective “sleek”. The titles in Dance Move, her propulsive and pleasurable second collection, tend to identify a character or characters (Mrs Dallesandro, Gloria and Max) or an emotional atmosphere (Memento Mori), dabbling at their most extreme in the meta-fictional (Bildungsroman) or double-edged – Nostalgie refers both to a song and the emotions it stirs, Cell to a faction and the virtual imprisonment entailed by membership. Even when Erskine begins with an unexplained allusion (“the night before”) or glimmer of intrigue (a man saying something not “entirely true”), the facts straighten themselves out soon enough, and just as often a situation is set down with unselfconscious baldness: “He was there as visiting professor of film”, “For the last nine years Linda and Rae had been having a takeaway together on a Friday night”.  The collection’s title is borrowed from one of the stories, though with a shift from the plural suggesting a desire for unity or cohesion. If anything serves to realise this function, beyond the Belfast backdrop and the use of the third person, it’s the emphasis on the unlived life. These are ghost stories of a kind, with alternative possibilities occupying the role of spectre. The opening tale, Mathematics, begins with a reference to the “remnants of other people’s fun” that the hotel cleaner Roberta keeps in her bedside drawer, and the closing story, Secrets Bonita Beach Krystal Cancun, ends with Rae asking Linda, “What do you think that looked like?” In between are many acts of wondering, speculation, daydreaming, fanciful forecast (“He’d have a Porsche Carerra at some point”). Rhonda, in Golem, about two couples at a country wedding, imagines absconding with her brother-in-law: “It was endlessly sunny with Edgar and sometimes they lived in a house she had seen in an interiors magazine that belonged to a professor at Stanford; a house in Palo Alto, all greenness and beautiful wood.” Erskine’s characters devote much of their energy to these acts of magical thinking – wishing that a child hadn’t died, or had been born to begin with, that a fleeting encounter had lasted longer, that potential hadn’t remained untapped, that “cosmic order” would displace the “patternless” and “meaningless”, or the “arbitrary rules” of everyday life. Temporary experiences provide a short-term way of trying on another self or sizing up another life, and also a breeding ground for future reverie. In Mrs Dallesandro, a wealthy middle-aged housewife recalls a teenage love affair back in County Antrim and a time when she “had ideas then about doing all sorts of things”. In Gloria and Max, an academic gives a woman a lift to a Christian film festival “in some godforsaken spot”, and long afterwards remembers “a stained pink anorak, her hand on his arm”. Erskine certainly doesn’t vindicate her characters’ fantasies or indulge their moments of self-pity. At times the punishment can be severe. Caro, in Cell, loses 25 years to the hollow promises of political utopianism. In Nostalgie, Drew, a former pop singer who works in IT, employs tortuous logic to justify accepting a compromising gig – and is repaid with regret. Gillian, in Memento Mori, had all along been “dreaming of” someone like Tracey, and Tracey’s mother had always hoped she’d meet someone like Gillian, but their relationship is brought short. Rhonda’s vision of California bliss with Edgar is suddenly “vaporised” when she sees him wearing slip-on shoes. As a writer, Erskine is confronted by a similar quandary – discipline and control on one side, freedom and possibility on the other. Sometimes she keeps things too simple, and makes her intentions too plain. Nostalgie, which ends with Drew at a slot machine trying to lose his tainted commission, is a 10-page parable, a cautionary tale about temptation and short-term thinking. Gloria and Max is a sketch. On the other hand, Golem feels overburdened with perspectives and backstory. But in the best stories – Mathematics, Cell, Memento Mori – Erskine’s unflashy effects accrete, achieving genuine cumulative power. She identifies what is most fruitful about her characters’ predicaments – the emotional core, the most resonant ironies – and traces with rapt and infectious attention their doomed if valiant attempts to shimmy away from the real.

2/24/2022,"The Australian prime minister has promised “further waves of sanctions” against Russians including hundreds of members of parliament as he condemned Vladimir Putin for the brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Scott Morrison said the Russian president had chosen war and Australia would “band together” with the international community to “ensure there is a cost for this violent, unacceptable and egregious behaviour”.  But the Ukrainian embassy’s head of mission in Australia wants the federal government to do more, calling for the Coalition’s sanctions to “significantly expand”. The invasion was condemned by both sides of politics in Australia, with the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, saying it was “a grave moment for humanity”. Australia and its allies must hold Russia to account for the “shameful act of aggression”, he said. Within minutes of Putin’s short televised address announcing a “special military operation” about 5am Ukrainian time on Thursday, explosions were heard near major Ukrainian cities, including the capital Kyiv. Morrison, speaking after briefings from Australian intelligence and security officials in Sydney, said the Russian government had “launched a brutal invasion, unprovoked, on Ukraine, and should be condemned for doing so”. “Right now, our thoughts are very much with those in Ukraine – those who are enduring a terrible invasion as the bombs fall and the shelling continues and the bullets are fired, as special forces from Russia are moving towards Kyiv and tanks are rolling in all around their borders,” Morrison said. A day after announcing sanctions on eight members of Russia’s national security council, Morrison said the government was applying measures on an additional 25 people. “This includes army commanders, deputy defence ministers and Russian mercenaries who have been responsible for the unprovoked and unacceptable aggression,” he said. Sanctions would also be applied to four entities involved in the development and sale of military technology and weapons, he said. Australians would be banned from dealing with a further four financial institutions. They are yet to be named. “There will be further waves of sanctions as we identify those responsible for these egregious acts, including – as I discussed this afternoon with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade – moving on over 300 members of the Russian parliament.” Morrison stopped short of expelling the Russian ambassador, Alexey Pavlovsky, from Australia, saying it was important to maintain channels of communication “even in moments of terrible conflicts such as this”. Morrison did not immediately detail which individuals and entities the sanctions would apply to. A list could be released publicly in the coming days, once the Australian assets of those being targeted are frozen or cut off. The prime minister and the foreign minister, Marise Payne, said in a joint statement that Putin had “fabricated a feeble pretext on which to invade”. “Russia’s disinformation and propaganda have convinced no one,” they said. Volodymyr Shalkivskyi, the Ukrainian embassy’s head of mission in Canberra, told ABC’s 7.30 program his government appreciated any help provided by foreign nations but sanctions “can change the situation”. “We will ask our partners to significantly expand sanctions against Russia,” he said. “We hope that there will be a next stage of sanctions that will cover more people who are involved in the aggression against Ukraine. It will be different financial and energy institutions of Russian origin and Russian oligarchs who have a significant influence on the Kremlin.” Shalkivskyi said Ukraine’s government would “defend our country”. “We were warned, we had time to prepare.” He said while Australian officials still had no evidence of any state-sanctioned cyber-attacks on Australian targets, the Australian Cyber Security Centre and the corporate sector were prepared for the possibility. The Australian government has said it stands ready to support internationally coordinated action to respond to any price or supply shocks in energy markets. Morrison urged the estimated 1,400 Australians who remain in Ukraine to leave if safe to do so and to register with Dfat. The prime minister said his thoughts were with Australians of Ukrainian descent, and also with Australians of Russian descent, who he said “will also be feeling terrible about these events”. The attack on Ukraine follows Putin’s announcement of a “special military operation” which the Russian president claimed was needed to achieve the “demilitarisation” of the country. Putin argued “a hostile anti-Russia is being created on our historic lands”. But Albanese said Putin’s attack on Ukraine was “wholly unprovoked and without justification” and the Russian government alone bore responsibility “for the bloodshed and suffering that will follow”. Albanese and the shadow foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said the attack would have broader ramifications. “It is also a contemptuous attack on one of the core principles of the post-World War II order, which is that all UN members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state,” they said in a statement. The Victorian opposition leader, Matthew Guy, who has family in Kharkiv, said: “Australian Ukrainians watch with horror at the invasion of a European democracy by the Putin dictatorship.” Public buildings in Melbourne’s CBD are to be lit up in the blue and yellow of the Ukrainian flag in a show of support to the people of Ukraine. The state premier, Daniel Andrews, said it would be “a distressing time for Victorian Ukrainian and Russian communities”. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine saw investors dump assets deemed to be relatively risky, sending stocks lower across the Asia-Pacific, while prices of bonds, oil and gold rose. Australia’s benchmark ASX200 share index tumbled almost 3% on Thursday, ending at 6,900.6 points for the lowest close this month. It was the worst day in about 17 months and erased $73bn from the market’s value, the Australian Financial Review reported. Bourses across the region posted similar falls of 2-3%, with Singapore’s 2.9% decline the largest intraday slide since mid-May. US futures were pointing to falls at 2% when Wall Street reopens later on Thursday. The Australian dollar fell about half a US cent for the day to 71.9 US cents. The Russian rouble is more akin to rubble, dropping 5.8% to a record low 86.12 per US dollar, Reuters reported. Investors bought up government bonds from Australia, the US and elsewhere, pushing prices up and yields lower. Many commodities, though, were in demand as investors speculated that sanctions and disruptions could limit supplies. Brent crude oil breached $US100 a barrel price for the first time since 2014, raising the prospect that Australian motorists will soon have to dig even deeper to pay for fuels that are already at record levels. Economists, such as Saul Eslake, have been wary about predicting much fallout for the Australian dollar, noting the local economy had a strong head of steam coming out of the Covid disruptions. More expensive energy, as well as turmoil on financial markets, could dim consumer confidence, they say. Food prices will also be worth watching – and could stoke inflationary pressures. A Bloomberg gauge of agricultural commodities hit a record high on Thursday. Earlier on Thursday, the Australian government revealed it would wait until the end of March to bring into force the sanctions that specifically curb trade with the two Ukrainian regions now recognised as independent by Putin. However, the initial sanctions on eight members of Putin’s security council will take effect from midnight Thursday. The sanctions on other individuals announced by Morrison late are also set to apply in the next few days.",News/World news,Australia condemns Russia’s ‘brutal and unprovoked’ invasion of Ukraine ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/australia-condemns-russias-brutal-and-unprovoked-invasion-of-ukraine
2/24/2022,"An elderly man who sparked a police manhunt when, acting out of love, he kidnapped his “sweetheart” from a West Australian aged care home has been killed in a car crash just two days after his partner died. Ralph “Terry” Gibbs, 80, died on Wednesday morning when his vehicle hit a utility on the Bruce Highway south of Bowen in Queensland.  His death came 48 hours after his partner of 15 years, Carol Lisle, 84, died in the aged care facility south of Perth from Gibbs had removed her in early January. Gibbs was driving back to his home in Queensland when involved in the crash. He had just found out about Lisle’s death. The driver of the second vehicle, a 60-year-old local man, was airlifted to hospital in a serious condition. Gibbs’ daughter Rochelle Palmay said it was an accident. “He had been on the road for long hours, he was told of her death while he was driving,” she said on Thursday. “I think he was emotionally tired and I don’t think he had slept enough.” Gibbs was returning from Perth, where he had been handed a seven-month suspended prison sentence on Friday in Perth magistrates court after pleading guilty to unlawfully detaining a person with a mental illness. Lisle, his long-term partner, had been suffering from dementia and Parkinson’s disease. Gibbs wheeled Lisle out the door of Mercy Place Mandurah in January and tried to drive her across Australia’s notoriously dangerous outback in heatwave conditions. The couple was stopped an hour from the Northern Territory border and Lisle was flown to hospital. Gibbs was subsequently charged and issued a restraining order. Palmay, who is one of Gibbs’ five surviving children and lives in New Zealand, said the pair had been inseparable for 15 years. “They met at a ballroom, they spotted each other across the floor,” Palmay said. “Dad came up to Carol and asked her to dance and they never stopped dancing since.” “They were such a beautiful couple, always social, always entertaining, a full of life couple. The type of couple people love to be around. They’re just lucky they found each other. How many people get to find true love at the end of their life.” Palmay said her father was always upbeat, sang and played the ukulele. He loved travelling with Carol and camping across the country. “People are so fortunate when they find that kind of love,” she said. “They had it. It should not have ended like this.” Lisle had been living in the WA aged care facility since last year after her goddaughter, Belinda Hodgkinson, travelled to Queensland and took her back to the state. Hodgkinson had known Lisle her whole life, her parents were friends and they lived just suburbs away from each other when she was growing up. Hodgkinson described Lisle as a vivacious socialite who loved life and people. “She just brought it all together,” Hodgkinson said. “She was always making everyone laugh and happy. The nursing home said she had the most visitors of all the residents. She was very loved.” She said Lisle wanted to leave Queensland and claimed Gibbs didn’t always look after her properly. Hodgkinson and Gibbs had been in a long-running dispute over who should care for Lisle. “She was very loved by family and friends and we were just trying to give her quality of life at the end, which she didn’t receive from him. That was proof – what he did.” Palmay refuted this claim – saying he never mistreated his partner. Lisle had been placed in the Mercy Place Mandurah aged care home in March 2021 by the State Administrative Tribunal under a guardianship ruling which Gibbs was challenging. Covid restrictions meant he had only been allowed into WA to visit her on four occasions in that time. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Outside court last Friday, Gibbs told reporters he was worried he would never see her again. “I fear I might never see my little girl again, she is fading quickly,” he said. Gibbs said that in the nursing home “all day every day she says, ‘Please take me out of here, please take me out of here,’ and when I would leave to go home she would say, ‘Can I come with you?’ She even wanted to walk to the airport.” Magistrate Raelene Johnston agreed Gibbs acted out of love when he took her but said his actions were “extremely dangerous”. “I accept that you believe you were acting out of love and that you were acting out of care for your partner and that you wanted to be with her, and you believed that she wanted to be with you,” Johnston said when sentencing Gibbs.",News/Australia news,Man who kidnapped ‘sweetheart’ from WA care home killed in crash days after partner died,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/24/man-who-kidnapped-sweetheart-from-wa-care-home-killed-in-crash-days-after-partner-died
