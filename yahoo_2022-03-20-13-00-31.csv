3/20/2022,"About three dozen would-be asylum seekers from Russia found themselves blocked from entering the U.S. on Friday while a group of Ukrainians flashed passports and were escorted across the border. The scene reflected a quiet but unmistakable shift in the differing treatment of Russians and Ukrainians who enter Mexico as tourists and fly to Tijuana, hoping to enter the U.S. for a chance at asylum. The Russians — 34 as of Friday — had been camped several days at the busiest U.S border crossing with Mexico, two days after city of Tijuana officials gently urged them to leave. They sat on mats and blankets, checking smartphones, chatting and snacking, with sleeping bags and strollers nearby as a stream of pedestrian border crossers filed past them. Five young girls sat and talked in a circle, some with stuffed animals. Days earlier, some Russians were being admitted to the U.S. at the San Ysidro crossing, while some Ukrainians were blocked. But by Friday, Russians were denied while Ukrainians were admitted after short waits. “It’s very hard to understand how they make decisions,” said Irina Zolinka, a 40-year-old Russian woman who camped overnight with her family of seven after arriving in Tijuana on Thursday. Erika Pinheiro, litigation and policy director for advocacy group Al Otro Lado, said the U.S. began admitting all Ukrainians on humanitarian parole for one year around Tuesday, while at the same time blocking all Russians. There was no official announcement. A Homeland Security Department memo dated March 11 but not publicly released until Thursday told border officials that Ukrainians may be exempt from sweeping asylum limits designed to prevent spread of COVID-19. It says decisions are to be made case-by-case for Ukrainians but makes no mention of Russians. “The Department of Homeland Security recognizes that the unjustified Russian war of aggression in Ukraine has created a humanitarian crisis,” the memo states. Homeland Security indicated in a statement Friday that anyone deemed “particularly vulnerable” may be admitted for humanitarian reasons on a case-by-case review, regardless of nationality. Russian migrants in Tijuana sat off to the side of a line of hundreds of border residents waiting to walk across the border to San Diego on Friday. The line was unimpeded. A 32-year-old Russian migrant who hadn’t left the border crossing since arriving in Tijuana with his wife about five days earlier had no plans to leave, fearing he may miss any sudden opportunity. Within hours of arriving, the migrant, who identified himself only as Mark because he feared for his family's safety in Russia, saw three Russian migrants admitted to the United States. After six hours, U.S. authorities returned his passport and said only Ukrainians were being admitted. “Ukrainians and Russians are suffering because of one man,” Mark said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He fled shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. U.S. officials have expelled migrants more than 1.7 million times since March 2020 without a chance to see asylum under sweeping authority aimed at preventing spread of COVID-19. But the public health authority, known as Title 42, is seldom used for migrants of some nationalities who are difficult to expel for financial or diplomatic reasons. But to claim asylum, migrants must be on U.S. soil and U.S. officials are blocking passage except for those it wants to admit. Even before Russia’s invasion, the United States was seeing an increase in Russian and Ukrainian asylum seekers,  most trying to enter at official crossings in San Diego rather than trying to cross illegally in deserts and mountains. More than 1,500 Ukrainians entered the U.S. on the Mexican border from September through February, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, about 35 times the 45 Ukrainians who crossed during the same period a year earlier. Ukrainians who can reach U.S. soil are virtually guaranteed a shot at asylum. Only four of the 1,553 who entered in the September-February period were barred under the public health order that lets the U.S. expel migrants without a chance at humanitarian protection. The number of Russian asylum seekers entering at U.S land crossings from Mexico surpassed 8,600 from September through February, about 30 times the 288 the same time a year earlier. All but 23 were processed under laws that allow them to seek asylum. Mexican officials have been wary of migrants sleeping at the border. Last month they dismantled a large migrant camp in Tijuana with tents and tarps that blocked a walkway to San Diego. Eager to stop another camp from forming, the city distributed a letter on Wednesday asking migrants to leave their campsites for health and safety reasons and offered free shelter if they couldn't afford a hotel.",World/Associated Press,"Russians are blocked at US border, Ukrainians are admitted",https://news.yahoo.com/russians-blocked-us-border-ukrainians-221951267.html

In a newly surfaced police video filmed during the investigation, Nichol detailed her affair with Chris and told officers that she questioned him about his family's disappearance when it made headlines. Per People, who verified the authenticity of the three-hour video, Nichol shared with authorities that she and Chris exchanged texts after Shanann Watts and her daughters, 4-year-old Bella and 3-year-old Celeste, went missing. ""I kept asking him, 'What did you do, Chris? What did you do?'"" she reportedly said in the video. ""I asked, 'Where's your family?'""

3/20/2022,"A Japanese company specializing in cardboard boxes, Aasu Danboru (“Earth Cardboard”), has designed a cardboard bed that is available to purchase online for $50.

Cardboard beds have been used for some time in Japan at evacuation centers during disaster reliefs due to the ease of mass production, transport and disposal. Earth Cardboard, however, has made the bed available to everyone through online retailer Rakuten.

In accordance with Japan’s Disaster Relief Law, the bed was designed with cardboard moving-box material and is 72 by 29 by 12 inches. The bed also passed a one-week durability test without any issues by an approximately 5-foot-9 man weighing 176 pounds.

One reason contributing to the cardboard bed’s affordable price is that the company reuses moving boxes to build the base of the bed. When the bed is pulled apart, the base can be reused as moving boxes to easily transport materials at evacuation centers.

In a press release, the company claimed that their product is “the industry’s cheapest cardboard bed.”

Cardboard beds have previously been a topic of interest when they were assigned to athletes at the 2020 Summer Tokyo Olympics and were erroneously reported as “anti-sex” beds. The beds were later repurposed for COVID-19 patients at a temporary medical facility in Osaka.

The beds are currently available from Japanese online retailer Rakuten for 5,490 yen ($50) with free shipping.

3/20/2022,"STORY: A new batch of asylum seekers are popping up at the U.S. Mexico border: Russians who are against the war in Ukraine. While U.S. officials have let dozens of Ukrainians through this week, Russians remain in limbo, prompting some to camp on the pavement alongside a barbed wire border fence, defying warnings from Mexican authorities to leave. One woman told Reuters she had fled Russia with her children after being arrested at an anti-war protest there, and said she burst into tears when she was rebuffed at the U.S. border as Ukrainians were let in. Mark, a restaurant manager who came from Moscow with his wife, flying to Mexico via Turkey and Germany in early March, called it discrimination. ""We have the same problem. Yes, there isn't war in my country but in my country there is a regime and I was escaping from that...."" He and his wife were arrested for three days last year after protesting in support of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, and said going back to Russia was not an option after new legislation that imposes up to 15 years in jail for actions found to discredit Russia's army. ""We are just here sitting, sleeping on the ground, and waiting."" The devastation in Ukraine has caused 3 million Ukrainians to become refugees, according to the United Nations, most of them in countries bordering Ukraine. Some Ukrainians crossing in Tijuana have been granted permission to stay in the United States for a year. But thousands of Russians have also left their country, according to media reports. Mikhail Shliachov said returning to Russia meant fighting in a war he opposed. ""My country (is) dangerous for me.

When asked on Thursday about Ukrainians and Russians at the border, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the government was helping people fleeing Ukraine, and that other programs were being considered to expand humanitarian aid. Between October 2021 and January, U.S. government data showed border officials encountered about 6,400 Russians, some of whom said they were dissidents and are now in the United States.

3/20/2022,"Russia's former foreign minister has dismissed the chances of nuclear war, declaring the prospect an ""empty threat"" from Vladimir Putin. Andrei Kozyrev, who served under Putin's predecessor Boris Yeltsin, also suggested the Putin era will soon end in ""disaster"" amid the Ukraine crisis. Putin ramped up his aggression three weeks ago when he put Russia's nuclear forces on high alert following the West's so-called ""unfriendly"" response following his invasion. At the very least, it raised the prospect that he was considering the use of a nuclear weapon, though experts dismissed this as rhetoric. And Kozyrev, speaking to The Economic Asks podcast, said he agreed. ""No it's just a blackmail,"" he said of the nuclear threat. Russia is believed to have 4,477 nuclear warheads. It is one of nine countries which has nuclear weapon capacities. Of the other eight, three are Nato allies - the US, France and the UK - among which there are 5,943 nuclear warheads. Kozyrev continued: ""Those forces which he allegedly ordered... sources are openly saying they don't see anything like that. It's an empty threat but he plays this game. Watch: Russia making ‘no real progress’ - UK government ""Those strategic weapons that he ordered on alert [are] suicidal weapons because if he sends a missile to Europe, Nato or the United States, he gets two back and there is no survival for anyone.""

3/20/2022,"Switchblade drones are among the military support items President Biden announced yesterday in an $800 million package for Ukraine. Why it matters: Unlike the large drones the U.S. military uses for reconnaissance and deploying weapons against targets, these tiny Switchblades are themselves the weapon. Stay on top of the latest market trends and economic insights with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free The Switchblade drones are sometimes called ""kamikaze drones"" because they act as single-use, remote-controlled bombs. They are small and easily deployed, and are intended to hit targets that are outside the line of sight. They are launched out of a tube much like a mortar. Once launched, the Switchblade drone can be controlled from the ground before striking its programmed target. It has a feature that allows a service member to call off the strike should the target have moved away or civilians are in the area. Manufacturer AeroVironment has two different models. The Switchblade 300 drone weighs 5.5 lbs. and is small enough to be transported in a rucksack. It can fly for up to 15 minutes, with a range of just over six miles. It has a cruising speed of 63 mph and top speed of 100 mph. It's designed for strikes on soldiers. The Switchblade 600 drone weighs 50 lbs. and fly for more than 40 minutes, with a range of about 25 miles. It has a cruising speed of 70 mph and top speed of 115 mph, and it was designed for strikes on soldiers and tanks. It's not clear how many of each model are being sent in the support package. Ukraine has used Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2s to launch guided missiles at Russian tanks, missile launchers and supply trains, according to the U.S. Department of Defense. The Bayraktar TB2s are not considered to be particularly fast or stealthy. But drones have had success against keeping Russian forces from securing air superiority. The smaller, more easily deployed Switchblades are expected to be even more effective in the war. What they're saying: ""These were designed for U.S. Special Operations Command and are exactly the type of weapons systems that can have an immediate impact on the battlefield,"" said Mick Mulroy, former deputy assistant secretary of defense.

3/20/2022,"MIAMI (AP) — Adrian Kellgren’s family-owned gun company in Florida was left holding a $200,000 shipment of semi-automatic rifles after a longtime customer in Ukraine suddenly went silent during Vladimir Putin’s invasion of the country. Fearing the worst, Kellgren and his company KelTec decided to put those stranded 400 guns to use, sending them to Ukraine's nascent resistance movement to help civilians fight back against a Russian military that has been repeatedly shelling their apartment buildings, schools, hospitals and hiding places. “The American people want to do something,” said Kellgren, a former U.S. Navy pilot. “We enjoy our freedoms, we cherish those things. And when we see a group of people out there getting hammered like this, it’s heartbreaking.” Cocoa-based KelTec's donation is a high-profile example of Americans collecting guns, ammunition, body armor, helmets and other tactical gear in response to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s promise to arm his citizens. But many similar grassroots efforts have been snarled by inexperience with the complex web of regulations governing the international shipment of such equipment. Kellgren, who has dealt with such red tape for years, managed to connect through a Ukrainian neighbor with a diplomat in the Ukrainian Embassy who helped him secure a federal arms export license in just four days. That process can often take months. This week, as Congress debated whether to send more advanced weapons and defense systems to Ukraine, workers at KelTec’s warehouse forklifted four plastic-wrapped pallets containing their 9 mm foldable rifles for delivery to an undisclosed NATO-run facility. From there, the shipment’s new recipient, Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense, will be responsible for smuggling the weapons into the war zone. “That’s when the real derring-do and heroism begins,” Kellgren said. From California to New York, elected officials, sheriff’s departments and nonprofits say they have also collected thousands of sets of body armor and millions of rounds of ammunition for Ukraine. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis kicked off a campaign last week to ask police and sheriff’s departments to donate surplus ballistic helmets and other equipment. “We know that it can urgently be used to help stop Putin and save Ukraine,” he said. But hazards abound: One New York City nonprofit leading an effort to collect tactical gear had 400 bulletproof vests stolen before they could be dispatched. Many of the organizers have no clue how to navigate international arms export rules, which sometimes require approvals from the Departments of State, Commerce and Defense to ship even non-lethal tactical gear. Organizers of one such drive in New York are piggybacking on KelTec's license to export 60 long guns they recently collected. “I’m hoping that this movement spreads through the whole United States and every gun store and every gun manufacturer in the U.S. accepts these donations,” Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman said at a news conference Friday. The National Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade group for firearms manufacturers, distributed step-by-step instructions this week to its more than 8,000 members on how to apply for an expedited export license. They also provided a list of specific sniper rifles, pistols and ammo requested by Ukraine’s Embassy in Washington. KelTec hopes to arrange more shipments in the future. Its license allows the export of up to 10,000 weapons and the company has offered the Ukrainians their own production line and weekly shipments. Details of KelTec’s efforts surfaced in a Justice Department filing this week by a Maryland-based real estate lawyer, Lukas Jan Kaczmarek, who said that as a volunteer with the Ukrainian-American Bar Association he is helping Ukraine acquire weapons in tandem with Volodymyr Muzylov, the first secretary at the Ukraine Embassy. “I expect to work in this capacity for the duration of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and I have not, am not, and shall not receive any monetary compensation for my assistance,” Kaczmarek wrote in his registration as a foreign agent of the Zelenskyy government. KelTec isn’t the only arms manufacturer to have answered the call. Another Florida company, Adams Arms, posted on its Facebook account a video  of what it said is a shipment of carbine rifles destined for Ukraine. The company has also started selling T-shirts emblazoned with the iconic final broadcast of a bombarded Ukrainian Border Guard unit that told a Russian warship to “Go (expletive) Yourself!” Proceeds from shirt sales will go to the Ukrainian National Bank’s war funds. While rifles are no match for Putin’s firepower of Sukhoi fighter jets and cluster bombs, they can play an important role if the Russians get bogged down in street-to-street combat, retired U.S. Army Major John Spencer said. The semi-automatic rifles KelTec is shipping are perhaps even more valuable than high-tech, anti-aircraft missiles that require extensive training beyond the reach of most civilians, many of whom have never even held a gun before, he said. “Every shipment of firearms is critical,” said Spencer, an urban warfare analyst at the Madison Policy Forum, a New York-based think tank. “You’re giving one more fighter, out of tens of thousands, the opportunity to resist with a simple-to-use weapon.” Kellgren said he’s been inspired by the resourcefulness and tenacity of Ukrainian citizens and is confident the rifles he’s sending will make a difference. “The people of Ukraine have had mostly just civilian firearms and they’re holding off a superpower,” he said. “So the X-factor here not isn’t necessarily what equipment you’re holding. ... It comes down to the will to fight.” ___ AP Writer Christopher Weber in Los Angeles contributed to this report.

3/20/2022,"Disney can’t seem to get it right. The company’s Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida, apologized Friday after a performance from a Texas high school’s drill team was laden with Native American stereotypes, including repeated chants of “scalp them!” It came just days after the company faced intense backlash over its silence to Florida’s controversial sex education bill, labeled by many critics as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill. The company told the Associated Press the performance, done by Port Neches-Grove High School’s “Indianettes” drill team on Tuesday, “did not reflect our core values, and we regret it took place.” It claimed the performance did not match the audition tape sent by the school to the park’s organizers. “We have immediately put measures in place so this is not repeated,” Disney spokesperson Jacquee Wahler said. The video was shared by Tara Houska, a tribal attorney and the founder of “Not Your Mascots,” a group dedicated to reducing stereotypical depictions of Native Americans. The school’s website—which features a Native American in a headdress as its mascot—said the Indianettes have been a tradition for half a century. The school district released a statement Friday saying it was aware of the backlash to the performance, though it claimed the routine had been performed at Disney for years and no issues has previously been raised.

3/20/2022,"The lawyer representing the mother of Hunter Biden’s three-year-old daughter said the president’s son will likely be indicted in a tax fraud investigation, in comments to CNBC on Thursday. “I expect him to be indicted,” attorney Clint Lancaster said. “Just based on what I saw in his financial records, I would be surprised if he’s not indicted.” Lancaster represents Lunden Alexis Roberts, a former stripper with whom Hunter Biden fathered a child. Roberts first sued Hunter Biden in 2019, claiming she had his daughter, and the suit was settled in January 2020 with Hunter agreeing to pay child support. Roberts testified a year ago as part of a probe into Hunter’s finances, Lancaster confirmed, adding that he gave investigators “a significant amount of Hunter’s financial records.” While Lancaster did not detail all the records he turned over, he noted that “I had his Burisma pay records. I had records of ultimately what Burisma paid into the United States.” Hunter Biden worked for Ukrainian energy company Burisma while his father was vice president. President Biden’s son has been under federal investigation since 2018 for potential criminal tax violations, and possible violation of money laundering and foreign lobbying rules, the New York Times reported on Wednesday. Hunter wrote in a 2014 email that Burisma officials “need to know in no uncertain terms that we will not and cannot intervene directly with domestic policymakers, and that we need to abide by FARA and any other U.S. laws in the strictest sense across the board.” Emails reviewed by the Times came from a cache first reported by the New York Post in 2020, which said the files were retrieved from Hunter Biden’s laptop. While it is unclear where the investigation into Hunter Biden will lead, Lancaster claimed that he and Roberts do not want Hunter to go to jail. “It’s not my goal, much to the unhappiness of many people in the Republican Party,” Lancaster told CNBC. Lancaster also said Hunter Biden has never seen or asked to see his daughter. “It’s sad, because the baby looks like him, with blond hair,” Lancaster said.

3/20/2022,"Sixteen GOP lawmakers voted against a House bill that seeks to promote public education on the history of Japanese Americans in World War II, including their incarceration in so-called “internment camps.”

The legislation, sponsored by Rep. Jay Obernolte of California — who is also a Republican — ultimately passed with 406 yeas on Wednesday, while 10 others did not vote.

Introduced as H.R. 6434, the bill directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a “Japanese American World War II History Network” within the National Park Service (NPS). Such a network will consist of all NPS units and programs related to Japanese American history and experiences in World War II.

Those experiences will include the persecuted group’s time in “relocation centers” and “confinement sites,” the bill said. Such terms, however, are controversial, with advocates advising against their use due to their failure to capture the harsh conditions endured by those forced into them.

The Republicans who voted against the bill include Reps. Lauren Boebert (Colo.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Michael Cloud (Texas), Louie Gohmert (Texas), Bob Good (Va.), Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.), Andy Harris (Md.), Clay Higgins (La.), Trey Hollingsworth (Ind.), Doug LaMalfa (Calif.), Thomas Massie (Ky.), Mary Miller (Ill.), Ralph Norman (S.C.), Matt Rosendale (Mont.), Chip Roy (Texas) and Van Taylor (Texas).

The lawmakers had various reasons for registering their opposition. A spokesperson for LaMalfa told The Hill that while he generally supports the bill, there are concerns that a historical site in his district cannot sufficiently accommodate tourists at this time.

Harris said the House should prioritize other legislation. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Roy said the matter will better be handled by “private and charitable entities,” according to The Hill.

About 126,000 Japanese Americans were forced into concentration camps in World War II. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat, issued the executive order following the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Rep. Bruce Westerman (Ark.), the leading Republican on the House Natural Resources Committee, acknowledged the bill’s significance in honoring Japanese Americans. “[It] will be an important tool to ensure that this history, no matter how painful it may be, is always remembered, and the important stories of interned Japanese Americans are told with honor and respect,” he said.

Aside from the bill, the House reportedly passed legislation that would preserve the concentration camps and create a grant program to promote education on Japanese American incarceration.

3/20/2022,"By James Pearson LONDON (Reuters) - Britain and the United States have warned organisations of the risks associated with using satellite communications following a cyberattack on satellite internet modems as Russia invaded Ukraine. Western intelligence agencies have been investigating the attack which disrupted broadband satellite internet access provided by U.S. telecommunications firm Viasat, Reuters reported last week. ""It's certainly something we're investigating quite actively - more than quite actually,"" a British official told reporters on Friday. ""We've been talking extensively to UK organisations to give them a sense of how we can advise them on that point."" The unidentified hackers disabled tens of thousands of modems that communicate with Viasat Inc's KA-SAT satellite, which supplies internet to some customers in Europe, including in Ukraine. Late on Thursday, the U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a joint statement which warned of the ""possible threats to U.S. and international satellite communication (SATCOM) networks"" in the wake of the attack. SATCOM network providers and customers should increase their security and report any malicious activity given the ""current geopolitical situation"", the statement said. French government cybersecurity organisation ANSSI and Ukrainian intelligence are assessing whether the remote sabotage was the work of Russian-state backed hackers preparing the battlefield by attempting to sever communications, Reuters reported. Russian troops have taken heavy losses while blasting residential areas in Ukraine to rubble, sending more than 3 million refugees fleeing.

3/20/2022,"(Reuters) -The Russian rouble fell in light trading in Moscow on Friday, with trading on separate exchanges stabilising beyond 100 to the dollar, after the central bank opted to hold rates at 20% and said it would start purchasing OFZ government bonds. The central bank kept its key interest rate unchanged on Friday, in line with a Reuters poll of analysts, following an emergency rate hike in late February, but warned of higher inflation and an economic contraction this year, without giving new forecasts. The central bank's actions have come in support of an economy buckling under the stress of sanctions from across the globe, triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine late last month. U.S. President Joe Biden sought to prevent Beijing giving new life to Russia's troops in a video call with President Xi Jinping on Friday as stalled Russian forces pressed on with bombardments of towns and cities. The rouble ended 1.6% weaker against the dollar at 104.82 in Moscow, and fell 0.95% to 114.80 to the euro, while rising for the week against both currencies. It has lost about a fourth of its value over the past four weeks. In offshore markets, rouble bids were last indicated at 102.75 per dollar and traded at 105. Trading on the stock market section on the Moscow Exchange has been closed for weeks but currency trading has continued. Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina, who was nominated for another term by President Vladimir Putin earlier on Friday, said the bank would begin buying OFZ bonds when the Moscow Exchange resumes trading those papers on Monday, hoping to limit volatility. Evgeny Suvorov, economist at CentroCredit Bank, said the bank had made clear this was a temporary measure to limit financial stability risks, and not akin to the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank's quantitative easing schemes. ""The central bank is afraid that the market at opening will go to hell and this will tear apart a load of banks and investment companies,"" he said. COUPON PAYMENT The rouble showed limited reaction to an indication that Russia had averted a default on its foreign currency bonds, after it paid interest due on two sovereign dollar bonds seen as a key test after the imposition of hefty sanctions. Those sanctions increased demand for foreign currency, which prompted the central bank to ban the selling of cash dollars and euros to individuals at banks' offices. A month ago, the Russian currency traded at around 76 to the dollar and 85 to the euro. Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in late February in what it called a special military operation to degrade its southern neighbour’s military capabilities.

3/20/2022,"BEIJING (Reuters) -Chinese President Xi Jinping told his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden on Friday that the Taiwan issue needs to be handled properly to avoid a negative impact on Sino-U.S. relations, according to Chinese media. China says Taiwan, which it views as a breakaway province to be brought back to the fold, by force if necessary, is the most sensitive and important issue in its relations with the United States. Washington, which is seeking Beijing's help in restoring peace in Ukraine after Russia's Feb. 24 invasion, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taipei but is Taiwan's most important international backer and arms supplier. ""Some individuals in the United States are sending the wrong signals to pro-independence forces in Taiwan, and that's very dangerous,"" Xi told Biden on a video call. ""If the Taiwan issue is not handled properly, it will have a subversive impact on the relationship between the two countries."" China sailed its aircraft carrier Shandong through the Taiwan Strait, shadowed by a U.S. destroyer, on Friday, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters, just hours before the Chinese and U.S. presidents were due to talk. A White House statement said Biden reiterated in the call with Xi that U.S. policy on Taiwan has not changed, and emphasized that Washington ""continues to oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo."" China has over the past two years stepped up its military activity near the island to assert its sovereignty claims. ""(We) hope the U.S. side will pay adequate attention"" to the issue, Xi told Biden. Taiwan's Foreign Ministry expressed thanks to Biden for his ""emphasis on maintaining the status quo of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, as well as his firm support for Taiwan's security"". It called on China to take concrete actions and condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Taiwan, which rejects China's sovereignty claims, has joined in Western-led sanctions against Russia and sent humanitarian aid for Ukrainian refugees. Xi also told Biden that the war in Ukraine must end as soon as possible, according to Chinese state media.

3/20/2022,"The husband of an Oxford University Press executive who died of a blood clot after she received the AstraZeneca vaccine has demanded that the Government compensate families who lost loved ones. Nicola Weideling suffered catastrophic bleeds on her brain after being hospitalised with blood clots caused by the vaccination, which she received 24 days before she died. The 45-year-old had complained to her GP about neck pain but was not diagnosed with vaccine side effects until she was taken to hospital with several other symptoms of blood clots. Speaking after his wife's inquest at Hampshire Coroners Court in Winchester, Kurt Weideling said the Government now needed to follow through on its promise to pay affected families £120,000 under the Vaccine Damage Payment programme. The programme gives a one-off, tax free payment if someone is severely disabled as a result of a vaccination, or on behalf of someone who has died. The family insists those like Mrs Weideling, who lost their lives after ""doing the right thing"" and getting vaccinated, should not simply be dismissed as ""collateral damage"". The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation recommended that people under 40 should not be offered the Oxford-made vaccine due to the increased risk of blood clots from the jab. The risk of the rare type of clot is eight times less than the risk of a clot caused by Covid, according to a University of Oxford study. The clots have been linked to 73 deaths out of 50 million doses of AstraZeneca in the UK. The court heard that Mrs Weideling had her first Covid vaccine on April 21 last year and received the AstraZeneca injection despite reported cases of people suffering blood clots as a result of its side-effects. After a few days she started to complain of neck pain and had a telephone consultation with her GP on May 6, but at that stage the problem was believed to be muscular. Mrs Weideling, from Winchester, was taken to Royal Hampshire County Hospital two days later after symptoms of headaches and bruising developed. She was given a CT scan of her head which revealed clots and was transferred to University Hospital Southampton. After being unable to reach his wife for a few days, Mr Weideling was told she had a ""significant brain bleed"" and did not regain consciousness. A post-mortem showed Mrs Weideling died on May 15, 2021, after suffering a stroke caused by Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia, otherwise known as blood clots caused by a vaccine. Jason Pegg, the area coroner for Hampshire, said: ""With the benefit of hindsight, it seems to me that the symptoms of pain in Nicola's neck were more likely than not to be associated with [blood clots]. ""Nicola was somebody who did succumb to blood clots. Nicola developed cerebral blood clots in consequence to her Covid-19 vaccination. A rare but recognised complication of the vaccination which led to a cerebral infarction [stroke]."" A government spokesman said: ""Every death is a tragedy, and our sympathies go out to Nicola's family. ""All vaccines being used in the UK have undergone robust clinical trials and have met the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's strict standards of safety, effectiveness and quality. ""The vaccine damage payments scheme provides additional support to help ease the burden on individuals who have, in extremely rare circumstances, been severely disabled due to receiving a government-recommended vaccine for a listed disease.

3/20/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The signs are abundant of how Ukraine frustrated Vladimir Putin’s hopes for a swift victory and how Russia's military proved far from ready for the fight. A truck carrying Russian troops crashes, its doors blown open by a rocket-propelled grenade. Foreign-supplied drones target Russian command posts. Orthodox priests in trailing vestments parade Ukraine’s blue and yellow flag in defiance of their Russian captors in the occupied city of Berdyansk. Russia has lost hundreds of tanks, many left charred or abandoned along the roads, and its death toll is on a pace to outstrip that of the country’s previous military campaigns in recent years. Yet more than three weeks into the war, with Putin's initial aim of an easy change in government in Kyiv long gone, Russia’s military still has a strong hand. With their greater might and stockpile of city-flattening munitions, Russian forces can fight on for whatever the Russian president may plan next, whether leveraging a negotiated settlement or brute destruction, military analysts say. Advisor to Ukrainian President Zelensky, Oleksiy Arestovych, says that the commander of the Russian Eighth Army, Russian General Andrei Mordvichev, was killed at the Chornobaivka airfield near Kherson. The Ukrainian Presidency claims the general was killed by strikes on an airfield just north of Crimea, saying he was the fifth top-ranking officer killed since the invasion began on February 24.  Despite all the determination of Ukraine’s people, all the losses among Russia’s forces and all the errors of Kremlin leaders, there is no sign that the war will soon be over. Even if Putin fails to take control of his neighbor, he can keep up the punishing attacks on its cities and people. Ukraine’s president said Russia is trying to starve Ukraine’s cities into submission and that Putin is deliberately creating “a humanitarian catastrophe."" “His instinct will be always to double down because he’s got himself into a dreadful mess, a huge strategic blunder,” said Michael Clarke, former head of the British-based Royal United Services Institute, a defense think tank. “And I don’t think it’s in his character to try to retrieve that, except by carrying on, going forward,” he said. Putin’s forces are waging Russia’s largest, most complex combined military campaign since taking Berlin in 1945. His initial objective, which he announced in a television address on Feb. 24 as the invasion began, was to “demilitarize” Ukraine and save its people from “neo-Nazis"" — a false description of Ukraine’s government, which is led by a Jewish president. Fatefully, Putin underestimated the national pride and battlefield skills that Ukrainians have built up over the past eight years of battling Russian-backed separatists in the country's east. At the start, Russians thought “they would install, you know, some pro-Russian government and call it a day and declare victory,” said Dmitry Gorenburg, a researcher on Russia’s security at the Virginia-based CNA think tank. “That was sort of Plan A, and as near as we can tell, they didn’t really have a Plan B.” Russia’s first apparent plan — attack key Ukrainian military targets, and make a quick run to Kyiv, the capital — failed immediately. It was foiled by Ukraine’s defenses along with the countless mistakes and organizational failures by a Russian force that had been told it was only mobilized for military drills. Clarke, the British researcher, related accounts of Russian troops selling communication equipment and fuel out of military vehicles to locals during the weeks they waited on Ukraine’s borders. With no friendly population to welcome them, Russian forces reverted to tactics from their past offensives in Syria and Chechnya — dropping bombs and lobbing missiles into cities and towns, sending millions of men, women and children fleeing. Putin’s forces are in position to capture the besieged port city of Mariupol. Overall, Russians appear to be fighting with three objectives now: to surround Kyiv, to encircle spread-out Ukrainian fighters in the east and to break through to the major port city of Odessa in the west, said Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military and program director at CNA. Kofman cautions that much of the information on the war is coming from Ukrainians or from their American or other allies. That makes the partial picture skewed and a full picture impossible. A senior U.S. defense official on Friday said the Russians have launched more than 1,080 missiles since the start of the war and that they retain about 90% of the combat power they had arrayed around Ukraine at the beginning of the invasion. The U.S. assesses that the airspace over Ukraine remains contested, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the military assessments. The Ukrainian air force is continuing to fly aircraft and employ air and missile defenses.. “Just look at the map, and you just look at how little progress the Russians have been able to make,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said recently. The math of military conquests and occupation may be against Putin in Ukraine. Estimates of Russian deaths vary widely. Yet even conservative figures are in the low thousands. That's a much faster pace than in previous Russian offensives, threatening support for the war among ordinary Russians. Russia had 64 deaths in five days of fighting during its 2008 war with Georgia. It lost about 15,000 in Afghanistan over 10 years, and more than 11,000 over years of fighting in Chechnya. Russia’s number of dead and wounded in Ukraine is nearing the 10% benchmark of diminished combat effectiveness, Gorenburg said. The reported battlefield deaths of four Russian generals — out of an estimated 20 in the fight — signal impaired command, he said. Researchers tracking only those Russian equipment losses that were photographed or recorded on video say Russia has lost more than 1,500 tanks, trucks, mounted equipment and other heavy gear. Two out of three of those were captured or abandoned, signaling the failings of the Russian troops that let them go. Meanwhile, Russia needs to limit its use of smart, long-range missiles in case they’re needed in any larger war with NATO, military analysts say. On Saturday, the Russian military said it has used its latest hypersonic missile for the first time in combat, claiming that the Kinzhal, with a range of up to 2,000 kilometers (about 1,250 miles), destroyed an underground warehouse storing Ukrainian missiles and aviation ammunition. When it comes to the grinding job of capturing and holding cities, conventional military metrics suggest Russia needs a 5-to-1 advantage in urban fighting, analysts say. Meanwhile, the formula for ruling a restive territory in the face of armed opposition is 20 fighters for every 1,000 people — or 800,000 Russian troops for Ukraine’s more than 40 million people, Clarke notes. That's almost as many as Russia's entire active-duty military of 900,000. On the ground, that means controlling any substantial chunk of Ukrainian territory long term would take more resources than Russia could foreseeably commit. Other Russian options remain possible, including a negotiated settlement. Moscow is demanding that Ukraine formally embrace neutrality, thus swearing off any alliance with NATO, and recognize the independence of the separatist regions in the east and Russian sovereignty over Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. Russia's other options include an unrelenting air campaign in which it bombs and depopulates cities as it did in Chechnya and Syria. U.S. officials also warn of the risk of Russian chemical attacks, and the threat of escalation to nuclear war. “Unless the Russians intend to be completely genocidal — they could flatten all the major cities, and Ukrainians will rise up against Russian occupation — there will be just constant guerrilla war"" if Russian troops remain, Clarke said. —— Associated Press writer Lolita C.

3/20/2022,"WASHINGTON — Launched by Moscow in 1999, the second Chechen war elevated the stature of Russia’s new and then little-known prime minister, a former intelligence officer named Vladimir Putin. Intended to bring the mountainous Islamic region back under the Kremlin’s control, the exceptionally brutal campaign endeared Putin to Russians nostalgic for a show of strength from what was considered by much of the world to be a fading nuclear superpower. “The bandits will be destroyed,” Putin said at the time, in an echo of how he would talk of the “Nazis” he now claims to be purging from Ukraine’s government and military. “We must go through the mountain caves and scatter and destroy all those who are armed.” So when Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov announced earlier this week that he was in Ukraine to support Putin’s invasion, it seemed as if the past had caught up with the present. Even though Kadyrov’s journey to the front — he claimed on social media to have nearly reached the capital, Kyiv, which is still under Ukrainian control — may have been fictitious, amounting to little more than a publicity stunt, some say his involvement could lead to an even bloodier conflict. “Kadyrov is a psychopath who personally tortures his political prisoners,” Russia expert Michael Weiss told Yahoo News, alluding to Kadyrov’s well-known human rights abuses. Weiss and others say the apparent presence of Kadyrov’s soldiers in Ukraine could signal a new phase of fighting, one in which the rules of conventional warfare are discarded as Putin becomes more desperate for victory. Kadyrov, 45, rules Chechnya under Putin’s supervision. And if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is the conflict’s leading man, Kadyrov is the more colorful counterpart to chief villain Putin, given to brandishing a golden gun and trotting out a pet tiger. And even as he was supposedly preparing for war, Kadyrov engaged in a social media feud with Tesla founder Elon Musk. His cartoonish demeanor, however, disguises a deep lust for power and a penchant for violence. Kadyrov commands a paramilitary outfit called the Kadyrovites, who work to suppress any rebellion in Chechnya, which has struggled to free itself from Russia (and other empires) for centuries. By doing Putin’s bidding — which has included hunting down opponents in Istanbul and Berlin — Kadyrov essentially guarantees he will retain the Kremlin’s support. “The Russian military is facing a critical lack of manpower,” explains Emil Aslan, professor of security studies at Charles University in Prague. Kadyrovites, he told Yahoo News, “are an essential asset to the Russian military, both in tactical and psychological terms.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Thursday that the Biden administration could not confirm the presence of Chechen fighters in Ukraine. But such confirmation has come from battlefield reports, as well as from social media posts, where a kind of meta-battle is being waged for world opinion. The Kremlin has not hyped Kadyrov’s role and, in fact, challenged the bombastic warlord’s own assertion that he was on the outskirts of Kyiv. At the same time, the Kremlin has few other allies to turn to. “Russia's scrounging for troops in Chechnya and beyond is probably a sign of how poorly the war has gone for them,” says Ben Friedman, policy director at the Washington, D.C., think tank Defense Priorities. Although Ukraine’s military is much smaller than Russia’s, poorly trained Russian conscripts have been repelled repeatedly since Putin launched an invasion last month. And with the United States and other nations continuing to supply weapons to Kyiv, Russia could be coming dangerously close to defeat, potentially leaving it to rely on the kind of grueling warfare that allowed Putin to declare victory in Chechnya two decades ago, after an earlier attempt to conquer the Muslim-majority region proved unsuccessful. Russian President Boris Yeltsin launched a disastrous invasion of Chechnya in 1994, seeking to keep the small, oil-rich republic from gaining independence. Yet Chechnya mounted a furious defense that culminated in a battle for Grozny, the Chechen capital, that left hundreds of Russian soldiers dead. The humiliated Russian army retreated, and Chechnya achieved a measure of autonomy — and peace. An earnest student of Soviet propaganda, Putin could now be trying to use crude stereotypes about Chechens’ fighting prowess to frighten an otherwise emboldened Ukrainian resistance. After a series of apartment bombings in Moscow and elsewhere that were blamed on Chechens — but were likely carried out by Kremlin security services — Putin started a second Chechen war that saw Grozny leveled and the small republic’s civil society effectively destroyed. In exchange for their loyalty, the Kadyrov family — who had once been rebels themselves — were given unfettered power over the Chechen populace. They have wielded that power ruthlessly, in particular when it comes to the nation’s gay and lesbian population. A 2006 report by Human Rights Watch found that dissidents could face almost medieval retribution. “They started kicking me, and then brought an ‘infernal machine’ to give me electric shocks. They attached the wires to my toes and kept cranking the handle to release the current. I couldn’t bear it,” a survivor of Kadyrov’s torture, named in the report as “Khamid Kh.,” testified. Bringing such methods to Ukraine would only exacerbate a conflict that has already led President Biden to call Putin a “war criminal.” A supporter of Putin’s campaign from the start, Kadyrov said earlier this week that he was on the battlefield and ready to fight. That assertion was later debunked by a Ukrainian news outlet that determined Kadyrov’s announcement had actually been sent from Chechnya. Still, Chechens are involved in the conflict, with Ukraine accusing them of trying to assassinate Zelensky. Their role could broaden should Russia’s assault fail to take Kyiv and other large cities. If forces aligned with Kadyrov “are asked to target neighborhoods, target civilians, they will do it,” says Jean-François Ratelle, a University of Ottawa expert on the Chechen wars. “They could be used to commit war crimes against civilians.” Putin could also use Chechens to shoot Russian conscripts attempting to desert, Ratelle said. The practice has precedent in Russian history: During World War II, Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin had Red Army frontline soldiers trailed by security services ordered to shoot anyone trying to retreat from the terrifying German onslaught. So far, all the alleged war crimes in Ukraine appear to have been committed by Russians at the Kremlin’s behest. But the prospect that Kadyrov could become more involved in the conflict alarms experts on Chechnya and its tumultuous history. Weiss, the Russia expert, said reports that Putin was recruiting fighters in Syria — where Russia helped bolster dictator Bashar Assad’s ruthless regime in that nation’s civil war — were another development pointing to an escalation. “Putin is throwing everything he can into this war.” If the second Chechen war cemented Putin’s grip on Russia, the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine could prove his undoing — but not before thousands more soldiers and civilians die in the process, especially if he looks to Kadyrov for the cruelly unconventional warfare that is the Chechen warlord’s calling card. Others see Kadyrov’s belligerent shows of support for the war in Ukraine as a desperate attempt to frighten Ukrainians with racist tropes about Muslim Chechens and their supposed disposition toward violence. Yet while Kadyrov himself is loyal to Putin — little surprise, since Putin installed his father as the leader of Chechnya in 2000; the elder Kadyrov was assassinated by separatists in 2004 — other Chechens despise the strongman and his Kremlin ties, choosing instead to fight on behalf of Ukraine. “I want to tell Ukrainians that real Chechens, today, are defending Ukraine,” a dissident Chechen commander said last month.",World/Yahoo News,'A psychopath': Chechen warlord Kadyrov raises prospect of more brutal phase to Ukraine war,https://news.yahoo.com/a-psychopath-chechen-warlord-kadyrov-raises-prospect-of-more-brutal-phase-to-ukraine-war-090033439.html

Mobius sees the Fed eventually raising rates to 6%-7% but such hikes shouldn't deter investing in stocks. Investors should be in stocks to protect against inflation even with the Federal Reserve likely to keep ratcheting up interest rates to cool down high prices, investing veteran Mark Mobius said Friday on CNBC. His interview took place two days after the Federal Open Market Committee raised the target on the fed funds rate for the first time since 2018 to combat hot inflation. Policymakers on Wednesday lifted rates by 25 basis points to a range of 0.25%-0.5%, embarking on the path it announced late last year toward battling inflation which has since risen to 7.9% as of February. ""[Anybody] who wants to protect themselves against this inflation must hold stocks. They must hold companies that are able to adjust their prices to inflation,"" said Mobius, a pioneer in emerging markets investing. The Fed's commentary this week suggested policy makers expect to raise the interest rate another six times this year and they see the benchmark rate reaching 2.8% in 2023. ""So, my thinking is that definitely, you're going to see higher and higher rates. And I expect to see rates in America go up to 6% or 7%,"" said Mobius. The Fed funds target rate hasn't been at 6% since 2001 under then-Chairman Alan Greenspan. ""But that doesn't mean the stock market has to go down. As you know, if you look at the history of interest rates of the stock market, there's not much correlation,"" said Mobius, who went on to say investors should have exposure to stocks for inflation protection. The S&P 500 this year had dropped into a correction, or a fall of 10% or more from a recent high, in part as investors prepared for higher borrowing costs. Some analysts this week have issued notes showing the broad-market equity index can advance during rate-hiking cycles. Independent research firm CFRA noted the FOMC this week launched its sixth rate-tightening cycle since 1994. The S&P 500 ""fell all five times in the first 30 days following the initial hike since 1994, but recovered to a 80% frequency of advance by the six-month mark,"" wrote CFRA's chief investment strategist Sam Stovall.

3/20/2022,"By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON (Reuters) - Russia has lost any illusions about ever relying on the West and Moscow will never accept a world order dominated by the United States, which is acting like a sheriff seeking to call all the shots in a saloon bar, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. Western nations have imposed sweeping sanctions across Russia's financial and corporate sectors in response to Moscow's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, plunging Russia's economy into its gravest crisis since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. Lavrov, President Vladimir Putin's foreign minister since 2004, said the West's reaction to what Moscow has called a ""special military operation"" had illustrated that the West was completely dominated by the United States and that the European Union was largely powerless. ""If there was any illusion that we could one day rely on our Western partners, this illusion is no longer there,"" Lavrov told Russian state-funded RT in English. Russia would look eastwards, he said.

""What the Americans want is a unipolar world which would not be like a global village but like an American village - or maybe like a saloon where you know the strongest calls the shots,"" Lavrov said. He added that many countries such as China, India and Brazil did not want to be ordered around by ""Uncle Sam"" acting like a sheriff. Russia's invasion has killed thousands of people, displaced more than 3 million and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States, the world's two biggest nuclear powers. Lavrov's defiant response to the West's effort to isolate his country echoed that of Putin, who has indicated in recent days that the post-1991 era of Russian history has drawn to a close and that from now on Moscow will look to China, India and, increasingly, inwards. ""We will now have to rely only on ourselves and on our allies who stay with us,"" Lavrov said. ""We are not closing the door on the West - they are doing so."" As the Soviet Union crumbled and the Cold War ended, many in both Russia and the West hoped that the confrontations which had divided the post-World War Two world would recede or even be bridged. Putin says Moscow's actions in Ukraine were necessary because NATO's enlargement threatened Russia, and that Moscow needed to save Russian-speaking people in Ukraine from oppression.

3/20/2022,"(Reuters) - A former Russian deputy prime minister who spoke out against the Kremlin's actions in Ukraine has quit as chair of a prestigious foundation after a lawmaker accused him of a ""national betrayal"" and demanded his dismissal. Arkady Dvorkovich, deputy prime minister from 2012 to 2018, became one of Russia's most senior establishment figures to question the war when he told U.S. media this week that his thoughts were with Ukrainian civilians. His comments prompted a senior ruling party lawmaker to demand that he be fired and to accuse him of being part of a ""fifth column"" undermining Russia. The 49-year-old had been chairman since 2018 of the Skolkovo Foundation, an innovation and technology hub on the outskirts of Moscow that brands itself as a kind of Russian Silicon Valley. On Friday, the Skolkovo Foundation said in a statement that Dvorkovich had decided to step down. He could not be reached immediately for comment. He remains president of the International Chess Federation (FIDE). Igor Shuvalov, chairman of the foundation's board of directors, said Dvorkovich had resigned, saying that he could no longer combine his duties at Skolkovo with his responsibilities at FIDE under the current circumstances. Thousands of people have been detained for protesting against Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which officials in Moscow describe as a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""de-nazify"" its former Soviet neighbour. President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday delivered a stark warning to people he called ""traitors"" in Russia who he said the West wanted to use as a fifth column to destroy the country. After his comments to Western media, Dvorkovich said in a statement on Skolkovo's website that he was ""sincerely proud of the courage of our (Russian) soldiers"" and that Russia had been targeted by ""harsh and senseless sanctions"". But the following day, Andrei Turchak, a lawmaker from the ruling United Russia party, called for his sacking. ""He has made his choice,"" Turchak said. ""This is nothing but the very national betrayal, the behaviour of the fifth column, which the president spoke about today.""
