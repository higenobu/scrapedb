4/14/2022,"A man in India has died by self-immolation after his boss reportedly demanded to have sex with his wife in exchange for a transfer.

Gokul Prasad, a 45-year-old technical lineman, was feeling distressed after his boss, junior engineer Nagendra Kumar, offered to process Prasad’s transfer if he sent “his wife [over] for a night.”

Both were employed at the Palia power station of Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPCL) in Lakhimpur Kheri, India.

Prasad had asked for a transfer so he could work closer to home and not commute as much, according to his wife.

On April 9, Prasad proceeded to pour diesel fuel over his body and light himself on fire in front of Kumar’s office. He was rushed to the hospital where he succumbed to his injuries and died the day after.

Before his death, Prasad recorded a video complaining about years of harassment and work abuse that he received from Kumar and his aide. Prasad claimed that Kumar was abusing his power, and he blamed him and his aide for his later death.

Prasad said he reported the abuse to the police, but he did not receive assistance and “nothing happened.”

Gokul’s wife explained that he was harassed by Kumar and his aide for three years before falling into “depression” while “taking medication.”

“He went into depression, and started taking medication, but they did not spare him. He was transferred to Aliganj and was facing difficulty in traveling. So he asked for a transfer closer home. They told him, ‘get your wife to sleep with us and we will get you transferred,’” Gokul’s wife said.

She also claimed that nobody came to help Gokul when he set himself on fire, and Kumar had “stood there and watched.”

Sanjiv Suman, a senior police officer, stated that Kumar and his aide are now facing charges for abetment to suicide and intentional provocation under the Indian Penal Code. Both have been suspended from UPCL.

“The lineman had alleged that the junior engineer used to demand money and made vulgar statements when he sought a transfer. We have registered a case. At the department level, the junior engineer has been suspended and an inquiry ordered. The case has been registered under the abetment to suicide charge,” Suman said.

4/14/2022,"Four men have been arrested after one of the accused’s phones was discovered to contain a video of them gang-raping a Bengal monitor lizard at the Sahydari Tiger Reserve in Maharashthra, India.

CCTV footage from the Maharashtra Forest Department showed the four men lurking around the forest and trespassing into the Sahyadri Tiger Reserve, which was created by the Indian government in 2008 to conserve Bengal tigers.

In addition to the video of the men sexually abusing the monitor lizard, officials also found photos of various animals such as porcupines and deer on the mens’ phones.

Bengal monitor lizards can grow up to five and a half feet long and weigh almost 16 pounds. They are currently categorized as reserve species under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972.

Forest guards initially only caught one of the accused, while the others fled. The remaining three were later found in Hativ village in the Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra. Officials said the men came to Kolhapur’s Chandoli village from Konkan to hunt.

The four hunters have been identified as Sandeep Tukram, Pawar Mangesh, Janardhan Kamtekar and Akshay Sunil.

The case was taken to the Indian Penal Court to discuss proper legal action and charges against the four men. According to the Indian Penal Code, Section 377 states that anyone who voluntarily commits intercourse with an animal “shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.”

4/14/2022,"STORY: John Spencer, a retired U.S. Army major and expert on urban warfare at the Madison Policy Forum think tank, said he was excited to see that the United States was sending artillery and artillery rounds. “In this phase, I think it is a shift in policy, say, absolutely we recognize that Ukraine needs the ability to fight Russia in the open and prevent basically their loss in Eastern Ukraine, right?... I think this is a shift in policy and recognizing the tools that are needed -- that's different, for sure,” he told Reuters. The new security assistance package, according to the Defense Department, includes 11 Mi-17 helicopters that had been earmarked for Afghanistan before the U.S.-backed government collapsed and 18 155mm howitzers, along with counter-artillery radars and 200 armored personnel carriers. “A Howitzer is a very large artillery round that when it impacts, it can really hurt a military formation even inside of a tank...And that's what Ukrainians need at this moment. They need to destroy the Russian convoys before they even get to the cities or near to locations they want to take,” Spencer said. This was the first time howitzers have been provided to Ukraine by the United States.",Politics/Reuters Videos,Analyst sees shift in Biden's additional military aid to Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/analyst-sees-shift-bidens-additional-032355421.html

4/14/2022,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — A pack of sled dogs belonging to an Iditarod veteran and reality TV star killed a family pet in Alaska, officials said. Authorities in Wasilla are investigating the March 30 incident involving dogs owned by musher Jessie Holmes, who finished third in year’s Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race and stars in “Life Below Zero: Alaska” on the National Geographic channel. Holmes, who lives in rural Alaska, was staying with his dog team at a Wasilla hotel that backs up to the adjacent homeowner’s yard. He let the dogs loose to relieve themselves when they attacked a pet dog named Lucky, who was attached to a lead in the yard. When Lucky’s owner, Liza McCafferty, came outside to retrieve the 8-year-old Havanese, she saw a black dog dart from under her deck. It was part of a pack that suddenly appeared in her yard, she told the Anchorage Daily News. She said the pack looked like it might attack her too, so she retreated. Then Holmes came down the hill to retrieve his sled dogs before returning to the home. “He came in and was very, very apologetic,” McCafferty said. “He was on the verge of crying.” Lucky was taken to a veterinary clinic but was dead. “It was just a really terrible accident due to my negligence,” Holmes said. Holmes said he has stayed at the hotel more than a dozen times and never had a problem letting his dogs loose to relieve themselves. He suspects two new dogs he had ventured off toward McCafferty’s yard, and the rest of the pack followed. “There’s no way to not be distraught about this,” Holmes said. He said he’s fully accountable for this and wants to make things right. Holmes said a Wasilla municipal official told him he would receive 10 loose dog citations and possibly another for animal cruelty, which could affect his mushing career. Wasilla Mayor Glenda Ledford said in a statement that he incident was under investigation.",U.S./Associated Press,"Dogs owned by Iditarod vet, reality TV star kill family pet",https://news.yahoo.com/dogs-owned-iditarod-vet-reality-001030433.html
