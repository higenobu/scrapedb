4/23/2022,"In the past 24 hours, Netflix has been hit with a double-digit barrage of Wall Street downgrades, and an epic stock sell-off. For investors, the worst blow of all came in the form of a no-confidence vote delivered by billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman. After the bell yesterday, the CEO of Pershing Square issued a brief but sobering letter to investors detailing that the hedge fund titan had just sold its entire stake in Netflix after the online streaming pioneer delivered a lousy Q1 report card that showed it's hemorrhaging subscribers. Wall Street Twitter was quick to tally up the loss: a staggering $430 million haircut for Pershing. https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/1516913501515702273 Netflix shares bombed 35.1% on Wednesday, and are down a further 1.4% in pre-market on Thursday. The stock is now trading at 2018 levels, and has lost two-thirds of its value since hitting an all-time high last November. Market observers saw a bit of schadenfreude in Ackman's costly Netflix dalliance. It was just three months ago that he very publicly told investors he was all in on NFLX—to the tune of a $1.1. billion buying spree—and that he had full faith in CEO Reed Hastings and his management team to turn things around. https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1486460691519361024 Fast-forward to yesterday, and Ackman was singing a different tune. He said he's lost confidence in the company's turnaround plan, which involves cracking down on password sharing, and selling advertising on the platform. He called the moves ""sensible."" But the deal killer for Pershing was how long it would take for the moves to bear fruit: two years. That was enough for Pershing to wave the white flag. ""While Netflix’s business is fundamentally simple to understand, in light of recent events, we have lost confidence in our ability to predict the company’s future prospects with a sufficient degree of certainty,"" Ackman wrote in the investor letter. Ackman's big bets have soured before. He famously went big on Valeant Phamaceuticals in 2015 just before the share price collapsed. He held onto the stock for two years, even adding to his position, a move that triggered an exodus of investors from his fund. This time, with Netflix, Ackman got in and out quickly, apparently unwilling to repeat the Valeant blunder. ""One of our learnings from past mistakes is to act promptly when we discover new information about an investment that is inconsistent with our original thesis. That is why we did so here,"" he wrote. This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Business/Fortune•yesterday,‘We have lost confidence’: Why Bill Ackman is so down on Netflix he’d rather take a $430 million loss than wait for a turnaround,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lost-confidence-why-bill-ackman-091200414.html
4/23/2022,"By Krystal Hu and Anirban Sen (Reuters) - It is the biggest acquisition financing ever put forward for one person. Elon Musk is doing it his way. More than two-thirds of the $46.5 billion financing package that Musk unveiled on Thursday in support of his bid for Twitter Inc would come from his assets, with the remainder coming from bank loans secured against the social media platform's assets. That is the reverse of how most investors structure buyouts, with debt secured against the assets of the target company typically comprising the majority of the financing. The banks backing Musk's bid balked at providing more debt secured against Twitter, arguing that the San Francisco-based company did not produce enough cash flow to justify it, people familiar with the matter said. Some banks were also worried that financial regulators could reprimand them if they took on more risk, the sources added. This will have an impact on Musk's returns, since debt secured against an acquired company can greatly amplify profits. To double the $33.5 billion Musk is contributing out of his own fortune to the buyout, Twitter's value would have to go up by 1.4 times. Had he put in only a third of the deal consideration as equity, Twitter's value would have to go up by only 0.7 times for that money to double. What is more, Musk has agreed to take out a risky $12.5 billion margin loan, secured against his stock of Tesla Inc, the electric-car maker that he leads, to pay for some of the $33.5 billion equity check. Were Tesla's stock to drop by 40%, he would have to repay that loan, a regulatory filing shows. Musk said last week that he did not care about the economics of the deal ""at all"" and that he was pursuing the acquisition because it was ""extremely important to the future of civilization."" ""It seems consistent with what he said,"" Eric Talley, a professor at Columbia Law School, said about Musk's financing. He added that the proposed deal structure would make it challenging for many private equity firms to join Musk as equity partners, given that they usually rely on saddling companies with debt to boost returns. Musk did not respond to a request for comment. Musk is the world's richest person, with a net worth pegged by Forbes at $270 billion. Yet most of his wealth is tied up in Tesla shares, and the proposed deal structure would dry up most of his available liquidity. He had already borrowed against $88 billion worth of Tesla stock, and the proposed acquisition financing for Twitter would push that figure to more than $150 billion, regulatory filings show. This would leave him little runway to get more cash out of his Tesla shares in the short term, since Tesla executives may borrow no more than 25% of the value of their pledged stock. Musk's loan against his Tesla stock to finance his Twitter bid is also expensive, potentially costing him about $1 billion annually in interest and amortization expenses, a regulatory filing shows. That gives him an incentive to refinance the proposed debt package at the earliest opportunity. It is not clear how much of the $21 billion in cash that Musk has committed to the deal is immediately available to him, and whether he would have to cash out on some of his assets. They include stakes in rocket maker SpaceX and tunneling startup Boring Co. Twitter's board plans to ask Musk to provide more details on the source of the cash he has promised to deliver, according to people familiar with the matter. A Twitter spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. EQUITY PARTNERS Musk has been looking for partners to reduce his equity contribution to the deal, one of the sources said. It is far from certain that such a partner will emerge. SoftBank Group Corp, one of the world's biggest technology investors, which places big bets on companies and often without using a lot of debt, has decided it will not pursue Twitter, people familiar with the Japanese conglomerate said. A SoftBank spokesperson declined to comment. Thoma Bravo LP, a private equity firm that had more than $100 billion in assets under management at the end of December, has been in talks with Musk about joining his bid, the New York Post reported on Thursday. A person familiar with the matter said, however, that Thoma Bravo had indicated to Twitter it was exploring a rival bid to challenge Musk, not joining him. A Thoma Bravo spokesperson declined to comment. Musk has also hinted at moving Twitter away from advertising, a prospect that has given pause to some private equity firms, given that Twitter relies on it for the majority of its revenue. Earlier this month, Musk tweeted that the company should generate more subscription revenue and rely less on advertising, because ""the power of corporations to dictate policy is greatly increased if Twitter depends on advertising money to survive."" He later deleted that tweet. Twitter's board is preparing to reject Musk's bid as too low by April 28, when the company is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings, sources have said. Musk, who has amassed a stake in Twitter of more than 9%, said on Wednesday he was exploring the possibility of taking the bid directly to Twitter shareholders with a tender offer. In that scenario, shareholders would not be able to sell their shares, because of a poison pill Twitter adopted, but they would be able to register their support for Musk's bid.

4/23/2022,"Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg is now facing ""internal scrutiny"" at the company after pressuring U.K. tabloid the Daily Mail to kill a story about her former boyfriend, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick. The revelations come in an explosive new report from the Wall Street Journal detailing a coordinated campaign to discourage the tabloid from publishing the story, pulling resources from both Activision Blizzard and Meta. Sandberg dated Kotick, now accused of facilitating a culture of sexual harassment and discrimination at his company, from 2016 to 2019. In spite of denying that he had knowledge of disturbing allegations of employee misconduct, including alleged rape, Kotick apparently knew about many of those incidents — a fact he concealed from the company's board. The Wall Street Journal report details how Sandberg contacted the Daily Mail's digital division in 2016 and again in 2019 as the tabloid was working to reveal a temporary restraining order against Kotick that a former girlfriend put in place in 2014. Sandberg and Kotick reportedly ""developed a strategy to persuade the Daily Mail not to report on the restraining order,"" working in tandem with employees from their respective companies. In both instances, Sandberg reportedly told the tabloid that Kotick's former girlfriend since retracted the allegations of harassment that prompted her to file for a restraining order. According to The WSJ report, Meta is now reviewing its COO's involvement in trying to kill the story about her then-boyfriend. When TechCrunch asked if Sandberg would have violated company policy by leveraging internal PR resources for a personal dispute, Meta declined to answer. ""Sheryl Sandberg never threatened the MailOnline’s business relationship with Facebook in order to influence an editorial decision,"" Meta Executive Communications spokesperson Mao-Lin Shen said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. ""This story attempts to make connections that don’t exist."" For a company weary from an unrelenting series of scandals, revelations about Sandberg's meddling in her ex-boyfriend's PR crisis are just another headache. It's not clear how seriously Meta is scrutinizing her behavior — or if the broader leadership team was even aware of it, though The WSJ does indicate her actions are under ""review"" for potentially breaking company rules. After years of tension and high stakes policy-setting during the Trump years, Sandberg is reportedly no longer as close with Meta CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg as she once was. It's possible that the Kotick situation will be viewed as yet another misstep in which Sandberg makes headlines for the wrong reasons. Internally, Sandberg is known for deploying Meta's PR resources in defense of her personal brand, though the degree to which Meta's COO was working in lockstep with the rest of company leadership around the Kotick situation isn't yet known. In a statement to TechCrunch, Activision Blizzard's board of directors stated that Kotick informed the senior independent director of the board about the ""incident"" in 2014 and later notified the full board. After an investigation through law firm Skadden Arps, the board determined that there was ""no merit to the allegations."" An Activision Blizzard spokesperson referred TechCrunch to Elizabeth McCloskey with the law firm Keker, Van Nest & Peters, who provided a statement from Kotick's former girlfriend, who the firm declined to name, walking back her former allegations against Kotick. "" … In 2014, I signed a sworn statement making clear that what I had said was untrue,"" according to the statement from Kotick's former girlfriend provided through the law firm. In the statement, she also accused The WSJ of ""exploiting"" her in order to publish an unflattering story on Kotick. Activision Blizzard employees staged a walkout and circulated a petition to call for Kotick's resignation in November in light of his involvement in the ongoing culture crisis at the company. Kotick has hung on as CEO so far, but reports suggest he won't retain the position on the other side of Microsoft's planned $69 billion acquisition of the company. Activision Blizzard also named two new women to its board Thursday, though the company told TechCrunch that the timing of this announcement is not connected to new revelations around Kotick. Those board additions are Substack Communications VP Lulu Cheng Meservey, formerly of TrailRunner, and Kerry Carr, an SVP from Bacardi. The pair of new board members will replace two men who are stepping down from the board. As Bloomberg observed, the additions will bring Activision Blizzard's board into compliance with California law that mandates a public company's board with six or more directors must include at least three women or face steep fines. Kotick himself will soon be leaving Coca-Cola's board, where he's served in a well-compensated role for a decade. The company faced pressure from some investors to remove Kotick in light of the unfolding scandal around company culture at Activision Blizzard, though the gaming executive says he will step down to focus on steering his company through its acquisition by Microsoft.

4/23/2022,"Elon Musk is clearly bullish on Tesla (TSLA), the potential of Twitter (TWTR), and the Optimus robot. ""I was surprised that people do not realize the magnitude of the Optimus robot program,"" the Tesla CEO said on the company's earnings call late Wednesday. ""The importance of Optimus will become apparent in the coming years. Those who are insightful or who listen carefully will understand that Optimus ultimately will be worth more than the car business and worth more than full self-driving, that’s my firm belief."" Tesla first revealed the Optimus robot — also known as Tesla Bot — at an artificial intelligence-focused event in August 2021. The robot, 5-foot 8 inches and 125 pounds, is designed to perform repetitive or mundane tasks that humans hate (or can't be hired to do in a tight labor market). Wall Street analysts generally don't believe Optimus will be a financial needle mover in the medium-term given they aren't being produced at scale. ""I would say no, but time will tell,"" Wells Fargo auto analyst Colin Langan told Yahoo Finance when asked about the robot impact. ""He has proven the markets wrong before."" In theory, the Optimus program has potential to help Tesla lower operating costs in its facilities —it's just a matter if Musk can make enough robots. In the meantime, what the Street is believing on Tesla is that could be on its way to another strong year of making electric vehicles profitably. Shares of Tesla rose 7% in pre-market trading as Tesla pummeled Wall Street estimates for sales, margins, and earnings. The stock was the number one trending ticker on the Yahoo Finance platform. Here's how Tesla performed versus Street estimates: Revenue: $18.8 billion versus $17.9 billion expected Adjusted earnings per share: $3.22 versus $2.27 expected Musk noted that despite COVID-19 related shutdowns at its key Shanghai manufacturing plant recently, Tesla production has come back with a ""vengeance."" He added that will aid in Tesla potentially delivering 60% more cars this year compared to 2021, ahead of many analyst estimates. ""Taking a step back, with the supply chain issues still a lingering overhang on the auto space and logistical issues globally, we believe these 'Cinderella-like' delivery numbers in a brutal supply chain backdrop speaks to an EV demand trajectory that looks quite robust for Tesla heading into the rest of 2022,"" Wedbush Managing Director Dan Ives said. Ives has a $1,400 price target on the stock. At current levels, Ives' price target assumes 33% upside over the next 12-months. Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

4/23/2022,"Approaching mid-year, we can see a clear shape developing for the markets in 2022, one based on increased volatility. The economy as a whole is facing challenges, in the form of inflation, a Fed policy shift, and continuing ripple effects from Russia’s Ukraine war and lingering COVID outbreaks, and investors are looking for pathways through it all. One clear path is to find the beaten-down stocks with potential for near- to mid-term outperformance. These are equities that have underperformed recently, leaving them with attractive valuations compared to the main market indexes – but Wall Street’s analysts still see strong fundamentals. It’s the picture of stocks that are too cheap for investors to ignore. Using the TipRanks database, we’ve pulled up details on two stocks that meet this profile. Both are Strong Buy-rated, both feature large upside potential, and both are down sharply in recent months. Let’s take a closer look. Morphic Holding (MORF) We’ll start with Morphic, an early clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing new therapeutic agents based on integrins. These are a wide family of proteins, deeply involved in multiple human biological processes. The company is working on orally deliverable small-molecule designed to target integrin functions. This approach has, in preclinical stages, shown some promise in the treatment of a range of conditions, including cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, autoimmune disorders, fibrosis, and several cancers. Morphic develops its drug candidate pipeline through its proprietary MInT platform. While most of Morphic’s pipeline tracks are still in preclinical stages, the company does have one drug candidate, MORF-057, in human clinical testing. This drug is a potential candidate for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In March, Morphic initiated the Phase 2a EMERALD-1 clinical trial, testing the drug candidate in the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, an IBD condition that causes inflammation in the digestive tract. The trial will enroll up to 35 patients, and is supported by positive Phase 1 data that indicated a dosing profile of twice-daily oral dosing. A Phase 2b trial is scheduled for initiation in the middle of this year. Furthermore, the company showed some important supportive factors in its recent 4Q21 earnings release. First, the company has an advantage over most early-stage biopharmas: a revenue stream. The company has partnership agreements with larger pharma companies, and in Q4 it derived $9.5 million in revenue from them. For the full-year 2021, revenues came to $19.8 million. In another major advantage for Morphic, the company reported having $408.1 million in cash on hand at the end of 2021. This was up 78% year-over-year, and represents a solid ‘war chest’ for the company. Despite these positive signs for the company, Morphic shares tumbled 48% over the past 12 months. Covering Morphic for investment firm Canaccord, 5-star analyst Edward Nash reminds investors that there are strong gains in store for MORF in 2022. Nash rates the stock a Buy, and his $68 price target implies an upside of 131% on the one-year time horizon. (To watch Nash’s track record, click here) Backing his bullish stance, Nash writes: ""We view Morphic as a compelling investment opportunity for the following reasons: (1) Integrin targeting is a proven success in IBD, and MORF-057 is differentiated from the $3.9B Entyvio. (2) Morphic is the scientific leader in integrin biology with the MInT platform to fuel partnerships and a pipeline. (3) MORF-057's ability to be administered orally allows the drug to be used much earlier in the IBD treatment paradigm. (4) MORF can learn from Entyvio's success in IBD, which created a model for integrin trial execution in both UC and CD and developed a sizable market for integrins in IBD."" It’s clear from the Wall Street view that Nash is no outlier. MORF shares have 5 recent analyst reviews on record – and all are positive, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is selling for $30 and its $74.40 average target indicates room for a 148% upside in the next 12 months. (See MORF stock forecast on TipRanks) Ooma (OOMA) Now we’ll shift our focus, from biotech to the telecom industry. Ooma, based in Silicon Valley, offers telecom solutions for businesses and individuals. Services include VoIP, messaging, virtual attendants, and video conferencing; services for individual consumers include residential phone and integration with mobile devices. The company was founded in 2004, and boasts that its business services are flexible, customizable, and scalable. In the telecom industry, POTS – the plain old telephone systems, or copper-wire networks – are being phased out, and earlier this month Ooma announced a turn-key solution for POTS replacement. Ooma’s Remote Device Manager was unveiled as a web portal manager for AirDial, the company’s wireless POTS alternative. The system is compatible with analog phone service and wireless networked data connections. Ooma has been consistently beating its earnings forecasts, and in March of this year it releases financial results for Q4 and full-year fiscal 2022, with ended on January 31. The company reported EPS of 13 cents, which was well above the 10 cents expected, and was up slightly from the 12 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. At the top line, revenue came in at $50.5 million, for a 14% year-over-year gain. Of the total revenue, 91% was derived from subscription and services, which grew from $41.1 million in fiscal Q421 to $45.8 million in the current report. The Q4 results were consistent with the full-year results; for fiscal 2022, the top line of $192.3 million was up 14% from fiscal 2021. All of this sounds like a solid foundation for a tech-based comm provider in today’s digital economy – but Ooma’s shares are down 34% so far this year. B. Riley analyst Josh Nichols believes that the current low stock price is an opportunity for investors, writing: “OOMA shares currently trade at just 1.6x FY23 EV/sales (peer group median of 3.4x FY23 EV/sales), valuation levels not seen since the onset of the pandemic in 2020, which we believe creates an attractive entry point given the number of irons in the fire…” Key among those ‘irons,’ in Nichols’ view, is the AirDial, as he explains: “Currently, there are ~30M POTS lines in the U.S., many of which will be phased out or completely decommissions over the next five years and will require a replacement solution... Management confirmed that AirDial is seeing overwhelming initial demand, and we believe the opportunity is only marginally reflected in the company’s FY23 revenue guidance given that every 10k AirDial units (assuming 2 lines per unit) equate to $6M in ARR…” In line with these bullish comments, Nichols rates OOMA shares a Buy, and sets a $27.50 target price, indicating confidence in a 104% one-year upside potential. (To watch Nichols’ track record, click here) Other analysts don’t beg to differ. With 4 Buy ratings and no Holds or Sells, the word on the Street is that OOMA is a Strong Buy. The shares have an average price target of $23.67, suggesting a 12-month upside of 71% from the current trading price of $13.82.

4/23/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- At a posh financial-industry gathering known for swaying palm trees and late-night yacht parties, this year’s main attraction was a face-off between a crypto billionaire and a futures-exchange kingpin. Most Read from Bloomberg Kremlin Insiders Alarmed Over Growing Toll of Putin’s War in Ukraine The Second Wave of the Russian Oil Shock Is Starting Ukraine Latest: U.S. Says It Has Slowed Tech Goods to Russia Putin Calls Off Storm of Mariupol With Ukraine Troops Surrounded Obamas to Leave Spotify, Seek Podcast Deal Elsewhere There was Sam Bankman-Fried, whose FTX platform has rapidly become a dominant venue for investing in virtual coins, going toe-to-toe with Terry Duffy, the longtime chief executive officer of CME Group Inc. at the event in Florida. Among the topics broached in their intense conversation was an FTX proposal to execute every aspect of customers’ crypto derivatives trades on its own -- thus bypassing other exchanges, banks and financial intermediaries. If FTX’s bid is approved by regulators, many in traditional finance fear the model could be applied to other assets, threatening Wall Street’s stranglehold over lucrative aspects of market plumbing. The centerpiece of FTX’s plan is using algorithms rather than brokers to help clear trades, a crucial process for settling transactions that ensures sellers get their funds and buyers get the assets they’ve purchased. “It’s the first real constructive disruption to traditional market structure that we’ve seen in awhile,” said David Weisberger, who earlier in his career built trading systems for Morgan Stanley and Two Sigma and now runs crypto company CoinRoutes. “All change creates tension.” Opponents say FTX’s plan would undermine investor protections, could cost brokers their jobs by cutting them out of trades and risks disrupting markets that are functioning well. But a bigger concern is that the proposal, which is being reviewed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, could give FTX a toehold to expand into vast markets for everything from oil to gold to currencies. When asked about the plan during a Tuesday Bloomberg Television interview, Bankman-Fried said that FTX is focused on retail crypto transactions for now. Though he added that “there are really interesting applications to a pretty wide variety of asset classes.” CME, New York Stock Exchange parent Intercontinental Exchange Inc., Cboe Global Markets Inc. and Wall Street banks that clear trades on those platforms could all be impacted if FTX does indeed grow beyond crypto. Last year, CME posted $3.8 billion in revenue from trading and clearing futures, while ICE made $2.4 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The high stakes were on display in March when Duffy, 63, and Bankman-Fried, 30, met at The Boca Raton resort, according to more than half a dozen people who witnessed the conversation that lasted more than an hour or were briefed on it. Onlookers attending the Futures Industry Association conference watched the exchange abuzz. Duffy and Bankman-Fried both declined to comment on their conversation, as did CME, ICE and Cboe on FTX’s plan. The CFTC, which also declined to comment, hasn’t specified a date when it will decide on the proposal. What makes FTX’s pitch so different is that customers would open accounts directly with the platform and its computers would monitor their trades made using margin, which involves putting up collateral. The automated system, as opposed to brokers, would then assess whether investments have lost value and if more funds must be deposited. Should positions fall below a certain level, the algorithms would even liquidate them. FTX already clears some trades directly, but the proposal would for the first time allow it to do so for crypto futures bought on margin by retail investors. The firm would put up $250 million of its own capital to backstop losses if buyers or sellers can’t fulfill their obligations. That contrasts with the model used by CME, which requires that its member brokers kick money into a communal fund to cover defaults. “It’s a sea change in how the futures industry has worked up to now,” said Julian Hammar, a partner at law firm FisherBroyles who previously worked at the CFTC. FTX’s bid has its own supporters on Wall Street including Nasdaq Inc. Executive Vice President Tal Cohen, who called it “a great step forward” in a recent interview. Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital, said the plan to cut out middlemen would benefit investors by reducing costs and making the market more efficient. Even as the CFTC deliberates, the industry is taking the fight to Capitol Hill. When the agency’s chairman, Rostin Behnam, testified March 31 before the House Agriculture Committee, he was grilled over FTX’s plan. ICE and CME have long been major contributors to lawmakers from both parties on the panel, which oversees the CFTC. David Scott, a Georgia Democrat who chairs the committee, warned the proposal “could very well make our derivatives regulatory system riskier and our customer protections weaker.” Behnam told lawmakers his agency is proceeding cautiously, but would fairly consider FTX’s plan. He compared it to the transition to electronic trading 30 years ago -- an idea that was initially met with resistance. FTX executives argue that their proposal is intended to offer an alternative way of trading, not to bypass intermediaries entirely. The CFTC will also get to weigh in on whether it could be applied beyond crypto, they said. “It’s just a natural human behavior to respond a certain way when something seems new or novel,” said Mark Wetjen, a former CFTC commissioner who’s now head of policy and regulatory strategy for FTX’s U.S. arm.
