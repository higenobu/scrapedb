4/16/2022,"A new mugshot released by Idaho authorities shows Lori Vallow after the 48-year-old was returned to jail Thursday. Lori spent 10 months in a mental health facility after a judge ruled she was unfit to stand trial for the murder of her children, but she was booked into the Madison County Jail at 1:04 a.m. Thursday morning after a judge restored the Idaho mom’s competency earlier this week, according to East Idaho News. District Judge Steven W. Boyce filed an order Tuesday ruling that Lori was now “fit to proceed to trial” and removed the stay on the criminal case against her. She’s expected to be arraigned on Tuesday, marking her first court appearance since June. Lori is facing first-degree murder charges in the death of her children Tylee Ryan and Joshua “JJ” Vallow, who were found buried on her current husband Chad Daybell’s property in June of 2020 after disappearing months earlier. She’s also facing first-degree murder charges in the death of Tammy Daybell, Chad’s first wife; conspiracy to commit murder charges for all three victims; and grand theft for allegedly collecting survivor benefits from Social Security meant for her children, according to East Idaho News. She is expected to go to trial, alongside Chad, in January of 2023. Daybell has pleaded not guilty to the nine charges against him in connection with the deaths. In Arizona’s Maricopa County, Lori is also facing charges of conspiracy to commit murder in the death of her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, who was shot to death by her brother Alex Cox in July of 2019 at her home. Cox claimed at the time that he had shot his brother-in-law in self-defense. However, according to an indictment in the case, authorities now believe Lori “agreed” with Cox that “at least one of them” would kill Charles on July 11, 2019. Cox died later that year of what authorities have determined was natural causes. Investigators have alleged that while married to Charles, Lori began to adopt an increasingly bizarre set of religious beliefs while getting immersed in the teachings of Chad Daybell, a religious doomsday author. Lori’s friend, Melanie Gibb, told investigators that Chad and Lori believed that her children had turned into zombies, or were possessed by dark spirits, before the children disappeared weeks apart in September of 2019, according to an earlier affidavit obtained by Oxygen.com. The couple had allegedly made similar claims about their respective spouses.  Chad and Lori got married in Hawaii just weeks after 49-year-old Tammy Daybell died in her home in October of 2019.
