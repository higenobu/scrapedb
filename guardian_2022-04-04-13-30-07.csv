4/4/2022,"Since Spanx were invented in 2000, corsets of all sorts have never really gone out of fashion. Shape wear, whether it is flesh-compressing spandex or the more ancient technique of boning, is always present on red carpets. The question is whether or not you can see it. At the 2022 Grammy awards, you could definitely see it. Nominated for seven Grammys this year, Olivia Rodrigo made one of the boldest proclamations. Striking lines of pink shimmer ran down the ribcage of Rodrigo’s black satin gown, then jutted straight down the length of the skirt. Looking more-or-less like a glow-in-the-dark skeleton suit, it advertised its frame-cinching interior right on the outside. The dress was made by one of this era’s unapologetic masters of boning, Vivienne Westwood. Doja Cat wore crystals sprinkled over her corset, while Dua Lipa’s was an explicit nod to bondage, all black leather straps and gold buckles. Both gowns were made by Versace – though Dua Lipa’s was vintage, from 1992, while Doja Cat’s was custom made for the event. dua lipa wearing vintage gianni versace fw1992 to the grammys pic.twitter.com/ZmsCn70i0j Donatella Versace also made an instructive appearance. Her lime green gown had a peekaboo window that showed all the boning and compression undergarments needed to suck a waist right in. Bringing Bridgerton to mind, rapper Saweetie’s Valentino two-piece kept its structural engineering work to the bust, compressing her cleavage into two perfect spheres. The boning work on St Vincent’s frothing pink Gucci dress was a little less extreme, but still absolutely visible; while Chrissy Teigen’s gown, also luminously pink and ruffled, was voluminous everywhere but its ultra-tight waist. Lil Nas X, whose taste in clothes runs as bold as his taste in memes, wore a panelled Balmain bolero embellished with pearls. Not quite a corset, but it came close. Meanwhile, after arguable contributing to the corset fever with her 2021 Vogue cover, Billie Eilish chose to opt out by pulling an oversized black Rick Owens overcoat over the top of her head. Justin Bieber also wore a giant jacket, albeit less successfully. Same energy: pic.twitter.com/XikhIWxek5 The plan? Become a meme on the #GRAMMYs red carpet. pic.twitter.com/Wi6cMMzHLQ Perhaps the evening’s most surprising corset was worn by singer Halsey, who goes by they/them pronouns. Theirs was deep burgundy and patent, and surprising not for any particularly fashion detail, but because they had undergone surgery for endometriosis just four days prior. They sensibly called it an early night, later posting to Instagram that they had removed the garment in favour of a T-shirt and a bowl of pasta. Halsey unfortunately had to leave this evening’s Grammy award show early due to ill health, but she made sure to stay and see BTS perform 💜Get well soon, @halsey ! @BTS_twt #BTS pic.twitter.com/PckJ4iODZZ",Arts/Music,Boning up: the 2022 Grammys red carpet was a festival of corsets,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/04/boning-up-the-2022-grammys-red-carpet-was-a-festival-of-corsets
4/4/2022,"From her housing estate in northern Marseille, Elisabeth, 68, who once voted for the left, will return a ballot for the far-right Marine Le Pen in the French presidential election this month. “People used to think Marine was nasty,” she said. “Now they realise she’s not. Other politicians are taking her ideas. They all talk like her now.” Elisabeth left school at 16 and worked at a shoemaker’s, in factories and as a housekeeper, but her €800 pension barely covers bills and food. “I live on credit, overdrawn by the middle of the month,” she said. “I make a weak stew and it lasts me three days. But Le Pen will cut taxes and put money in our pockets.” She agrees with Le Pen’s anti-immigration stance. She feels “Europeans” are becoming outnumbered in multi-ethnic northern Marseille and worries about crime. “I’ve been mugged twice, once for a necklace, once for a cigarette,” she said. Society is tense and divided, she feels, but Le Pen will “calm things down”. After a decade spent trying to detoxify the jack-booted image of the far-right, anti-immigration party she took over from her father, Le Pen this week reached her highest poll ratings and popularity. Polls show her not only reaching the second round final against the centrist president Emmanuel Macron on 24 April, but significantly closing the gap. An Ifop poll alarmed Macron’s camp by showing her reaching 47% against his 53%, the narrowest margin yet and far closer than when he defeated her with 66% in 2017. Political opponents still decry Le Pen’s National Rally party as racist, xenophobic, antisemitic and anti-Muslim, but polls show that, while society once rejected her as the “devil” of the republic, public perception of her has softened. On her third presidential bid, Le Pen, 53, has risen to become the second favourite political personality in France behind Macron’s former prime minister Edouard Philippe in Elabe’s latest monthly survey. Le Pen’s focus on the cost of living – and the rising energy prices likely to be exacerbated by the war in Ukraine – has allowed her to shrug off her past connections to Vladimir Putin, whom she visited in 2017. “She’s dangerous,” the interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, said last week. “She could win this presidential election.” On a walkabout in western France, Macron warned against people “looking away” from the reality of her radical programme and “finding her nicer”. The presidential election campaign has been the most far-right in France’s modern history. In addition to Le Pen, another far-right candidate emerged: the former TV pundit Eric Zemmour, who has convictions for inciting racial hatred. Using more inflammatory language than Le Pen, he has anchored the discredited conspiracy theory of the “great replacement” - in which he claims local French populations could be replaced by newcomers, making France a majority Muslim country on the verge of civil war – in mainstream debate. Between them, Le Pen and Zemmour have about 30% of the vote in the first-round polls. Les Républicains on the traditional right, and their struggling candidate, Valérie Pécresse, have ramped up their rhetoric on immigration as they compete with Zemmour. Instead of damaging Le Pen, Zemmour has strengthened her. “Something quite amazing happened during this campaign. The radicality of Eric Zemmour has softened the image of Marine Le Pen,” said Bruno Cautrès, a political scientist at Sciences-Po university in Paris. “She’s less radical to many voters, she looks less aggressive than Eric Zemmour, she’s got more respectability.” Le Pen’s hardline manifesto policies have not changed, and overlap with Zemmour’s. She has promised a referendum on immigration and a rewrite of the constitution to ensure “France for the French” — where native French people would be prioritised over non-French people for welfare benefits, housing, jobs and healthcare. The Muslim headscarf, which she calls “a uniform of totalitarian ideology”, would be banned from the streets and all public places. Le Pen’s key themes – concerns over insecurity and crime, a feeling of decline and social inequality, and her linking those issues to immigration and a percieved threat of Islamism – have taken up more space in the public debate in recent years. “The ideas we’ve always fought for have become the majority opinion,” said Jordan Bardella, 26, the rising star of the party and its current caretaker leader, as he met voters in Marseille. Queueing to see him, a retired school psychologist from the French Riviera said: “My sister is a doctor, my brother-in-law an architect, we’re not the type of family that used to vote Le Pen, but these days it’s easier to be open about it.” Raphaël Llorca, a communications consultant at the Fondation Jean Jaurès thinktank and the author of a book on Le Pen and Zemmour, The New Masks of the Far-right, said the tone of Le Pen’s campaign was deliberately different this year. “In previous campaigns, she was very populist, presenting ‘the people versus the elite’ in a way that was very aggressive and virulent. Her political strategy was to harness all different types of anger,” he said. “Now, her view is that division and conflict won’t work. Her political reading of Macronism is that Emmanuel Macron is a president who has divided people – there have been the [anti-government] gilets jaunes protests, demonstrations over the Covid health pass. She calls him the ‘president of chaos’ and says she can ‘calm’ things. It’s very different. She’s seeking to demobilise the voters who usually turn out to stop her. She wants to anaesthetise society’s reflexes against the far right, neutralise her critics.” Pollsters still consider a Le Pen presidential win unlikely, but, for the first time, some analysts see it as an outside possibility. Uncertainties remain over the rate of abstention and whether leftwing voters would once again turn out in high numbers to vote for Macron in order to keep her out. To soften her image, Le Pen often references her love of Bengal cats and recent diploma to become a breeder. “She’s transformed herself into a kindly cat breeder? Lies!” said Macron’s economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, at a recent rally, adding that Le Pen had always pushed “a discourse of hate”.",News/World news,The rise and rise of France’s far-right Marine Le Pen,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/the-rise-and-rise-of-frances-far-right-marine-le-pen
4/4/2022,"Uninsured residents in flood-affected areas of New South Wales will be eligible for cash payments to help with the clean-up efforts after the state’s second major flooding event in a month, as recovery efforts continue across the state. The premier, Dominic Perrottet, will announce the grants of up to $20,000 in Lismore on Monday, which will also be his first day back after taking leave after the birth of his seventh child. Housing remains a key concern for residents and emergency services, with thousands of people still displaced and living in temporary accommodation and with friends or family. The deputy premier, Paul Toole, said on Monday that the independent inquiry into the floods – due to report by the end of June – would consider planning and development in flood-prone areas, including the potential to relocate homes and residents. “As we go forward we need to ensure we are not building these houses and businesses in these areas,” Toole said. The state government’s Back Home cash scheme will be available for renters or owners whose homes and belongings were damaged or destroyed in the major flooding events if they were unable to claim insurance or disaster relief payments. Payments will be available to people living in the Lismore, Kyogle, Ballina, Byron, Hawkesbury, Clarence Valley, Richmond Valley and Tweed local government areas. Money can be put towards whatever brings the home up to a habitable state, including repairs to services such as gas and electricity, rebuilding areas and the purchase of white goods. Thousands of Australian defence force personnel remain in the northern rivers, where they are assisting State Emergency Service and Rural Fire Service crews to restore access to areas cut off in last week’s deluge.

State police deputy commissioner and northern NSW flood recovery coordinator Mal Lanyon has urged displaced people to register with ServiceNSW so the government can get a handle on how many people still need help. He told the ABC the second round flooding had hampered recovery efforts. “But they are a strong community up here, they’ve got past this before,” Lanyon said. The government and agency responses to the extreme weather and flooding events over the past month have come under scrutiny, with questions over why an evacuation order was lifted for Lismore and then reinstated just hours later.",News/Australia news,"Uninsured flood victims can receive up to $20,000 payment under NSW scheme",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/04/uninsured-flood-victims-can-receive-up-to-20000-payment-under-nsw-scheme
4/4/2022,"Flood warnings remain in place in parts of eastern Victoria after heavy rain and strong winds lashed Gippsland overnight. Moderate flood warnings have been issued for the Mitchell and Snowy Rivers, with minor warnings issued for the Avon, Cann, Genoa, Tambo and Nicholson Rivers. There is also a flood watch warning for East Gippsland and the eastern parts of West and South Gippsland. “The reason for that is that the water still travelling through the catchments,” the Bureau of Meteorology’s Miriam Bradbury said.“So as that water is moving downstream, we will likely continue to see changes to the flood warnings as the catchment and the flood gauges respond to that movement of water,” Bradbury said. The Victorian State emergency services said on Monday there were watch and act warnings in place for the Mitchell, Bemm and Snowy Rivers. Residents are warned access routes may be affected. The Snowy River at Jarrahmond is at 6.32 metres, with moderate flooding, and expected to peak at about 6.4 metres on Monday morning. Bradbury said there was a deep low pressure system moving across from the south-east NSW coast across eastern Australia over the weekend moving quite close to the Gippsland coast, bringing with it strong west to south-westerly winds, as well as significant rain across Gippsland. The immediate threat of severe weather has dissipated after the heavy rain on Sunday. Mount Waldron fire tower recorded the most, with 186.2mm of rain to 9am Sunday and 92mm to 4am Monday. She said the immediate threat of severe weather has passed, with a low pressure system just east of Bass Strait moving east across the Tasman sea today. “That low is now moving offshore, so it’s moving out across the Tasman Sea and taking the worst of those impacts with it,” she said. A trough crossing Victoria on Wednesday is expected to bring increased shower activity to the south, particularly Gippsland, but Bradbury said rainfall totals are not expected to be anything like that experienced on the weekend, with two to 10mm expected across most parts of Gippsland, and up to 20 to 30mm in the very far east parts of Gippsland.",News/Australia news,Rain wanes but flood warnings remain in place over eastern Victoria as water flows downstream,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/04/rain-wanes-but-flood-warnings-remain-in-place-over-eastern-victoria-as-water-flows-downstream
4/4/2022,"Nearly 130 native Australian reptiles targeted by international wildlife smugglers will be added to a global convention in a step the Morrison government and conservationists hope will stifle the “cruel and abhorrent” trade. The spiny-tailed gecko, shingleback lizard and several blue-tongue lizard speciesare among the reptiles that the environment minister Sussan Ley has listed for inclusion under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (Cites). “Sadly, our reptiles have become a major international target, and while I stress very clearly that it is already a crime under Australian law to export these animals without specialised permits, this listing will secure additional international support for their protection,” Ley said. In the last two years the environmental crime unit at the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment has convicted 11 people on wildlife trafficking charges, with combined sentences of almost 27 years in prison, Ley said. She said government agencies continue to track down networks involved in the “cruel and abhorrent” trade. Cites has notified the government the 127 species will appear on a formal list by the middle of this year. Ley said it represented one of the biggest listings of any signatory to the convention since it came into force in 1975. The unique features and colours of Australian reptiles make them highly sought after globally and a target for wildlife smugglers. Cites is the same convention that bans exotic wildlife and products from animals, such as ivory. Conservationists at Humane Society International (HSI) proposed the listing of the reptiles in 2020. Despite their export being illegal, the reptiles were being routinely advertised on pet trade websites and Facebook groups in Europe, HSI said. “The illegal trade in reptiles is often cruel, where live animals are bound with tape and stuffed into socks or small containers before being shipped abroad with no food or water,” Alexia Wellbelove, a senior campaign manager at HSI, said. “Many do not survive the journey. This listing is another weapon in our arsenal against the illegal international trade of live reptiles.” The reptiles will appear under appendix three of the convention, meaning that countries will have to report imported animals to help Australia track the trade. Wellbelove said HSI was optimistic the reptiles would in future receive higher protection under appendix one of the convention, meaning a formal ban on their international trade. There are 1,082 species and 36 sub-species of plants and animals on the Cites banned list. Australia was an original signatory to the convention.",News/Environment,Australia adds 127 reptiles to global treaty in crackdown on ‘cruel and abhorrent’ smuggling,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/04/australia-adds-127-reptiles-to-global-treaty-in-crackdown-on-cruel-and-abhorrent-smuggling
