5/12/2022,"Elon Musk said China will produce ""some very strong companies,"" praising the country's workforce. By contrast, he said, ""in America people are trying to avoid going to work at all."" Musk famously slept on the factory floor the Model 3's ""production hell"" back in 2018. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said he expects China to produce ""some very strong companies,"" due to the country's workforce. ""There's just a lot of super-talented hardworking people in China who strongly believe in manufacturing,"" Musk said in an interview with the Financial Times on Tuesday. ""They won't just be burning the midnight oil, they will be burning the 3 a.m. oil,"" he continued. ""They won't even leave the factory type of thing, whereas in America people are trying to avoid going to work at all."" Musk himself famously slept on the floor of Tesla's Fremont factory during ""production hell"" for the Model 3. ""I wanted my circumstances to be worse than anyone else at the company,"" he told Bloomberg in 2018. ""Whenever they felt pain, I wanted mine to be worse."" Last month, workers at Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory were reportedly required to sleep at the facility as production resumed following a three-week shutdown. A memo reported by Bloomberg indicated that each worker would be provided with a sleeping bag and an air mattress and expected to work 12-hour shifts with one day off per week. Workplace tides may be shifting in China however, after tech workers there protested the ""996"" schedule that had many working 72 hours per week, from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. for six days. ""This way of working is very harmful for the human body, we've heard a lot of news about deaths from working overtime in recent years, but this deformed overtime system still prevails,"" one blogger wrote at the time. ""We can't help but ask — is it really worth it to exchange our lives for money?"" Musk's recent comments came in response to a question about which electric vehicle startups impressed him the most, to which he responded that Volkswagen — though far from a startup — was ""doing the most"" on the EV front. Musk later praised the software engineers and technologists on his team, saying that his companies' focus on challenges like artificial intelligence and spaceflight help him attract top talent. The best minds, he said, are more interested in pushing the bounds of innovation more than getting paid a lot to work on something boring. ""It's not a money thing,"" he said. ""It's really just how interesting are the projects.""

Volodymyr Demchenko described what it was like killing Russian forces during an interview with CNN. It's a ""very weird feeling to be honest, but it's like a sport now,"" Demchenko said. A Ukrainian soldier in a small town that was liberated after a weeks-long Russian occupation amid the Kremlin's war with Ukraine said that killing Russian forces is ""like a sport now."" Soldier Volodymyr Demchenko described killing Russian forces during a recent interview with CNN in Novyi Bykiv, a town located in the Chernihiv region and is about 50 miles east of the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. CNN reported that Demchenko was on the drone team that successfully helped to take back Novyi Bykiv from Russian forces. ""You know, it's funny to see…it's not funny to see, it's actually very strange when you see people being killed and you're like, 'Yeah!"" Demchenko told CNN as he raised his arms in the air. He added that it's a ""very weird feeling to be honest, but it's like a sport now, I don't know."" ""They don't come to us with flowers,"" Demchenko told CNN in reference to Russian troops. Though Novyi Bykiv has been liberated, the town is still reeling from the destruction and losses it endured amid its occupation by Russian forces. Demchenko told CNN that his home was hit by Russian strikes, but his life was spared because he was outside at the time of the attack. The soldier pointed out where Russian troops were killed as he showed CNN's Erin Burnett around the village. ""There was a boot here and there was another with leg,"" said Demchenko. ""There was not dead bodies, it was just the pieces of dead bodies."" Russian President Vladimir Putin launched Moscow's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine on February 24 and the war has since left thousands dead on both sides, including many Ukrainian civilians. In recent weeks, Russia has focused its attacks in Ukraine on the eastern Donbas region after Russian troops failed to take Kyiv and other major cities.

5/12/2022,"The 26-year-old New York woman accused of fatally shoving an 86-year-old voice coach did so in an angry fit that began when she was kicked out of a closing park while eating dinner with her fiancé, prosecutors said Tuesday. Lauren Pazienza spent the night of March 10 gallery-hopping with her fiancé in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood in celebration of 100 days until their wedding, the fiancé told authorities, according to a court document. Pazienza had ""several glasses of wine"" during the evening before the pair stopped at a food cart for something to eat, according to the document filed by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. The pair went to Chelsea Park to eat their meal, but before they were done, an employee told them they would have to leave because the park was closing, the document said. Chelsea Park closes at 11 p.m. ""The defendant became angry, started shouting and cursing at the park employee, threw her food onto her fiancé, and stormed out of the park,"" according to prosecutors. Pazienza's fiancé told police that he packed up and intended to head back to their Queens apartment because he didn't know where she had gone. Meanwhile, Pazienza ""stormed"" down the street and spotted Barbara Maier Gustern, prosecutors said. Gustern, ""in what turned out to be her dying words"" before she lost consciousness, told a friend that a woman with dark hair “ran across the straight,” directly toward her, called her a b--ch, and pushed her as hard she ""had ever been hit in her life"" toward a metal fence, prosecutors said. Gustern, according to a witness, ""fell in an arc, falling directly on her head,"" according to the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. Pazienza ""turned around and walked away, leaving Ms. Gustern prone on the sidewalk, bleeding from the head,"" prosecutors said. Pazienza, prosecutors noted, is 175 pounds, while Gustern was less than 100 pounds at the time of her death. Gustern was helped back to her apartment by the witness, but by the time she arrived at the hospital, her brain had swelled so badly that she was incoherent. She died five days later. The medical examiner said the deadly wound was caused by “substantial force."" Following the assault, Pazienza called her fiancé, he told authorities. When they reconnected, she picked a physical fight with him, accusing him of ruining her night, prosecutors said. He insisted the two head home, but surveillance video from the area showed Pazienza stayed in the area long enough to watch the ambulance arrive for Gustern. She later told her fiancé what she had done, he told authorities. When he asked her why she would do such a thing, she said the woman ""might have said something” to her. Pazienza on Tuesday was charged in a New York State Supreme Court indictment with manslaughter in the first degree and assault in the second degree, according to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. She pleaded not guilty. Pazienza's attorney Arthur Aidala, who has previously represented Harvey Weinstein and Rudy Giuliani, did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday. Prosecutors, in revealing additional details about the night of the attack and the days following, requested that Pazienza be held without bond. Prison records show she is being held at the Rose M. Singer Center at Rikers, without bond. She is next due in court on July 26. Prosecutors argued that Pazienza is a flight risk because she evaded police for more than a week, despite constant media coverage and pleas from Gustern's loved ones to turn herself in. She deleted her wedding website and all of her social media accounts, almost erasing herself from the internet. After she learned of Gustern's death, she hid out at her parents' Long Island home, stashing her phone at her aunt's so police wouldn't find it. She also later fled to her aunt's house as police began closing in. After they visited her parents' house on March 19, Pazienza turned herself in. ""After allegedly walking away from Ms. Gustern as she laid on the ground bleeding, Lauren Pazienza went to great lengths to avoid accountability for her actions,"" Bragg said. Pazienza originally posted $500,000 in bail. Prosecutors argued she could do it again, and flee. Prosecutors say all evidence shows the shove was ""intentional."" They are seeking a sentence of 15 years in prison, but say Pazienza could face up to 25 years on the manslaughter charge alone. “This was a senseless and unprovoked attack,” Bragg said. “Barbara Gustern was a beloved vocal coach who lived a vibrant and active life at the age of 87, and her loss was felt deeply by many throughout the city.""",U.S./NBC News,"New York woman enraged over being kicked out of park before fatally shoving vocal coach, say prosecutors",https://news.yahoo.com/york-woman-enraged-over-being-144816537.html

5/12/2022,"By Karen Freifeld and Luc Cohen NEW YORK (Reuters) -Former U.S. President Donald Trump must pay a $110,000 fine to the New York state attorney and meet other conditions to purge a contempt of court order for his failure to comply with a subpoena in a civil probe into his business practices, a judge said on Wednesday. The judge, Arthur Engoron, told a virtual hearing that a $10,000-per-day fine he imposed on Trump in late April stopped accruing on Friday, when Trump and his lawyers filed new affidavits detailing steps they took to find documents relevant to Attorney General Letitia James' investigation. Trump has said he does not have any relevant files, a claim Engoron said last month he found surprising. The judge gave Trump until May 20 to comply with additional conditions, which include submitting affidavits from his personal assistant and others familiar with his record-keeping practices, and the completion of a report by a third-party firm hired to search the Trump Organization's records. The contempt order could be restored if those conditions are not met, Engoron said. James has said her probe has turned up evidence that the Trump Organization - which manages hotels, golf courses and other real estate around the world - has given banks and tax authorities misleading financing information in order to obtain financial benefits such as favorable loans and tax breaks. A Republican, Trump denies wrongdoing and calls the investigation politically motivated. James is a Democrat.
