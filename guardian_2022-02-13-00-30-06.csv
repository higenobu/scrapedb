2/13/2022,"A resolution to the problems with the Northern Ireland protocol is unlikely to be reached before the Stormont assembly elections in May, the leader of the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) has said. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said that “very little progress” was being made in negotiations between the UK government and the EU, describing the likelihood of a swift resolution as “quite small”.  Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, and Maroš Šefčovič, the European Commission vice-president, met in London on Friday to begin a series of intensive talks to try to end the impasse over the protocol. Despite both sides declaring they wanted a deal before March, hopes for success have remained low, with Boris Johnson privately putting the chances of a new deal for Northern Ireland being achieved this month at below 30%. The DUP leader told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “There is very little progress in the talks, as we saw yesterday. I think that the likelihood at the moment of agreement being reached is actually quite small. That was confirmed to me by the prime minister. “He doesn’t expect, unless something changes dramatically, that agreement will be reached this side of an election, to remove the Irish Sea border.” Donaldson said he “wish[ed] it were otherwise”. The DUP leader added: “I want to see the political institutions restored and operating fully restored – we’re committed to that. But we want to see Northern Ireland’s place within the UK internal market fully restored.” His remarks follow the resignation last week of Northern Ireland’s first minister, the DUP’s Paul Givan, in protest over the protocol. The party say the protocol, designed to avoid a border on the island of Ireland, has eroded a cornerstone of power-sharing in the region – governance by both nationalists and unionists. The UK is pursuing an interim deal that would scrap most of the checks on food and farm products followed by a wider solution on government after the May elections. Assembly elections are scheduled for 5 May, but there will be no functioning executive during the interim period, meaning some political decisions cannot be made. Donaldson said that even while the assembly continues to pass legislation and departmental ministers are able to take decisions, “obviously without an executive being able to meet, without the north-south ministerial council being in place, there are certain decisions that can’t be taken”. He accused the UK government of “dishonouring” its commitment to protect Northern Ireland’s place in the UK internal market. “We entered government back at the beginning of 2020 following an agreement called New Decade, New Approach, and in that agreement the UK government gave a solemn commitment that it would protect Northern Ireland’s place within the UK internal market, that it would introduce measures to afford that protection. “Over two years later it has not done so and we believe the UK government has dishonoured the agreement that was the basis upon which the devolved institutions were restored in Northern Ireland,” he said, adding that the DUP felt that it was “now time for the government to follow through and honour that commitment”.",News/Politics,"Talks on Northern Ireland protocol making ‘little progress’, says DUP leader",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/12/talks-on-northern-ireland-protocol-making-little-progress-says-dup-leader
2/13/2022,"When photographs appeared last week of a faux fur-clad Liz Truss in Moscow’s Red Square, it was impossible not to draw a comparison to an almost identical picture of Margaret Thatcher in Soviet Russia 35 years ago. Yet the arresting image was only the latest in a torrent of official pictures of the foreign secretary’s exploits. There are, in fact, very few moments in Truss’s five-month stint at the Foreign Office that have not been caught for posterity by publicly funded official photographers. A review of the government’s official account on the photo-sharing platform Flickr reveals that since the day she took up the post, more than 700 pictures have been uploaded featuring Truss – an average of more than four-and-a-half a day, or about one photograph for every five hours in the job.  While there are brief interludes depicting Steve Barkley at Ikea, Priti Patel visiting Boots or Rishi Sunak stroking a parrot, the official stream of photographs is dominated by Truss, now seen by many Tories as the frontrunner to replace Johnson should he be forced from office before the next election. Sydney, Moscow, Mexico City and Mumbai are just some of the locations forming the backdrops for Truss, with each visit documented in detail. Some of the most notable shots include fist-bumping with Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, driving a tank in military gear in Estonia, chatting with Henry Kissinger in New York (her run across the Brooklyn Bridge was also captured), sitting in a F35B fighter jet on the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier, and staring down her formidable Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. Worryingly for potential leadership rival Sunak, she was also photographed on the chancellor’s home turf – opening the London Stock Exchange. When at home, she is captured in the grandeur of Chevening, her grace-and-favour country mansion. Zoom calls are also included. There is even a picture of Truss meeting one of her own ministers. The foreign secretary’s new-found life through a lens has not gone unnoticed by her ministerial colleagues. It has also raised criticisms about the prolific use of official government photographers. Critics say their skills are now helping Tory leadership hopefuls show their best sides. While Truss dominates the government’s official photostream, Sunak actually has his own Treasury Flickr account, though it has only managed about 340 photographs of the chancellor since the September reshuffle that saw Truss arrive at the Foreign Office. It is not unusual for foreign secretaries to find themselves in front of the camera. Yet some Tories regard her very public outings as a straight-forward attempt to curry favour with party members before a possible leadership election. One minister put it bluntly: “It is an ignorant way to behave.” Her odyssey also contrasts strongly with some of her more photo-shy colleagues. Environment secretary George Eustice, for example, appears to have featured in just three photographs on the official Flickr account since September – and one of those is his official cabinet portrait. The other two were taken as he entered Downing Street for a cabinet meeting in November. The prime minister has also been making use of his own official photographer, Andrew Parsons, and has made visits to hospitals and vaccine centres as pressure has grown over alleged lockdown parties in Downing Street. Twelve such trips have appeared on No 10’s Flickr account since the start of November. Alan Sparrow, chair of the UK Picture Editors’ Guild, said that while independent photographers were still invited on ministerial trips, the increasing use of the government’s own snappers raised potential pitfalls. “My initial reaction to the staff photographers was that I feared that the other pool positions would be shut down and that we would be obliged to use just the handouts,” he said. “So far that has not happened. However, there are no guarantees – it just needs a change of staff or attitudes and we would find ourselves in a position where the only images available are those given out by No 10.” Political opponents are more scathing about the official portraits, given that they are a potentially powerful element of a party leadership campaign. “At a moment when Europe faces its biggest security crisis in decades, Liz Truss seems more interested in Instagram diplomacy than working with our allies,” said Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson. “These serious times deserve serious leaders. We need a foreign secretary focused on the task at hand, not using a taxpayer-funded photographer to further her leadership ambitions.” The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: “It is vital that the government and its ministers communicate to the public and other audiences what they are doing for the UK. Pictures help tell that story. Social media and digital engagement are critical communications tools, and our photographers play a leading role in supporting the government’s digital communications activity.”",News/Politics,‘Instagram diplomacy’: concerns grow over Liz Truss’s publicly funded five photos a day,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/12/liz-truss-instagram-diplomacy-five-photos-a-day-foreign-secretary-flickr
2/13/2022," Him: “What are you doing?”Me: “I’ve got to write 500 words on ‘keeping love alive’, before I go out.”Him: “What? In case it all changes, when you go?” In other words, my husband even after more than 30 years of near-functioning togetherness is taking nothing for granted, or he is exercising his terrific sense of humour. Or maybe he’s got a point – perhaps I’ll have an epiphany in the Co-op and we’ll have to re-evaluate everything. But as for formulas for a happy union, one size will not fit all, what one couple may need to do more of, another couple should do less. For one couple, it might work if they believe you shouldn’t sweat the small stuff. For others, it might work better if niggles are brought into the open before they get too big. Some swear by openness, and others, the judicious use of deceit, or tactfulness as it’s often called. We are not equations, we are humans. We are formed by different genes, cultures and ongoing experiences. We don’t all need the same thing, or even stay still – so it is likely that what worked for a couple at the beginning of their relationship might need to come under review later on. I cannot give you a fail-safe recipe for lasting love, I’m doubtful about the universal applicability of the following tips, but if any of them resonate with you, they might be useful. 1. Aim for mutual understanding over gaining victories over each other. I don’t recommend entering a relationship believing love will conquer your personal demons and, then, when it doesn’t, blaming your partner for you not feeling happier. Remember your partner is not responsible for your happiness, you are. 2. Remember loving touch. Personally I’m fond of a bit of skin on skin, but one person’s skin on skin is another person’s being tied up in the broom cupboard – takes all sorts. Nobody, not even your partner, knows exactly what it is like to be you and you cannot ever know what it is like to be someone else. But to have someone who knows and sees most of you, stays interested about you as you evolve and you stay curious about them, then as years pass your mutual knowing deepens… That, I think, grows intimacy, although it could be the not-knowing part of this, that advantages physical intimacy. 3. Commit to each other. If you have one foot in Plan B, you won’t be giving everything to Plan A. You find out what you each want if either of you are not to go mad and you compromise, so you each get a bit of what you need. You find out what you can stand, they find out what they can stand, then you work together to see if you can stand it. Sometimes, you can more than stand it, it can make you both better people. Happy Valentine’s. PP The one core thing is having the motto: “When you’re upset, the world stops and I listen.” That’s what (the data shows) separates great relationships from bad ones. I carry a notebook and pen in my back pocket at all times. So, when my wife, Julie, says those four most terrifying words – “We need to talk” – I can whip out my pad and say, “I’m listening, what’s the matter?” Once, she spoke for two hours. I was jotting down what was being said the whole time. When we look at how couples have maintained loyalty, there’s something very simple that is always present. It’s about always thinking for two. Even when I’m alone, Julie is a constant presence in my mind. The decisions I make, even on my own, are about our benefit – not just mine. One time, Julie and my daughter were in a pottery shop. Not interested, I sat outside. And then this rare event happened: an attractive woman started flirting with me. I was flattered and could have enjoyed it. But, wanting to build trust and commitment, I said: “You’ll enjoy this pottery shop. My wife and daughter do.” That’s what commitment looks like. And, while it’s comforting to think that when you’re truly in love everything just works out, in truth that’s not everything. There’s actually much more to it, right from the start. The beginnings of relationships are all about building trust, scoping out whether we can rely on each other. Once that trust is established, we turn to the question of commitment: are you committed to both me and us? Feel empowered; be proactive. Whether or not a relationship works isn’t down to chance alone. MSgottman.com Whether based on the relationships we see depicted in popular culture, our own previous experiences, or those of the people we grew up with, we all have what I call an “inner object of couple”. We each come into relationships with expectations; templates of what we assume couplehood should be. That can become a struggle needing negotiation: your partner will come with their own visions. We don’t always need to be in sync: there’s nothing to fear in your partner growing and changing, it’s only natural and will contribute to your sense of aliveness. Don’t be scared, but see it as an opportunity: your partner can function as a thorn agitating for your development and growth, too. Counterintuitive as it may sound, communication probably isn’t the problem in your relationship, but the symptom. People often construct this theory – that they’re struggling to communicate – but this is usually just a manifestation of an underlying issue. We create communication problems when we don’t want to hear or say what’s actually going on. Finding ways to communicate better is fairly straightforward, it’s often superficial. So, I start by asking people to describe the difficulty they’re having communicating. It might be interruption or hyper-excitement; getting too angry or shutting down. Once that is identified and cleared up, you can turn to the task of listening: make a clear distinction between when you’re in listening and expressing mode. Take turns deciding when one of you is communicating, and then sit and listen, hear without interruption. When speaking, monitor your own emotional state, and make sure you’re not shut down or overwhelmed. There’s an “optimal zone of emotional engagement” beyond which conversation stops being of use. If you find you’re going too far in one way or another, just take a break, rather than keeping at it and hoping for the best. And then, pause. Don’t do anything for a while afterwards. If you can create that space, putting the different positions on the table, we are inclined to solve the problem in front of them, it’s in our genes. MSCouples Therapy is on Mondays at 10pm on BBC2; all episodes available on BBC iPlayer State your needs and ask questions early on. When dating, we’re often not asking the right things. I’ve spoken to many couples who are married and are only then talking about whether they want to have children or not. Why wait so long? These are conversations to have at the beginning. Are these big questions, or are we just treating them like they are? We overthink what we can talk about in regular conversation. If it feels a like struggle to bring these topics up, find a natural segue: did you see the news that… [some celebrity] is pregnant? That can open up a conversation about kids; do you have any friends’ weddings this summer? And then decide: should I be dating people who want very different things from me? In some cases the answer will be no. We’re inclined to compromise on things that really matter to us when we meet new folks because we want to keep them around, but that may very well present problems down the line. If you carry one, at least you’ll make an informed decision. Be clear from the get go about what you want. Yes, on all that big stuff, but on the little things, too. Often we do this in relation to physical attributes. You might want someone tall, with a moustache and a neat haircut. That’s not a bad thing, but we need to think beyond physical attributes. If dating someone who follows you on social media, laughs at corny jokes and takes a real interest in your career really matters, then also look for those details. They’ll impact your daily life for a lot longer as you age and looks fade. Be sure to tell your partner what you need, and repeat yourself regularly. It’s easy to feel as if you’ve told your partner something twice and end up feeling frustrated with them for not remembering, when in fact we need to ask four or five times for it to sink in. And, I’m biased, but do see a therapist. Certainly not just when you’ve hit a crisis point. The couples who do better use therapy as a preventative tool, rather than a last resort when (ultimately) minds have already been made up. It’s not a failure, admitting defeat, but allowing an expert set of eyes to guide and support you. Maybe start at home: I always recommend co-reading a relationship book. Both take a chapter, then sit and discuss how it’s relevant to you. MSnedratawwab.com Couples really needn’t be compatible. Conflict? It’s not a bad thing. That’s a myth. In Northern Europe and North America, we tend to believe feelings should be damped down – particularly anger. But there’ll always be significant differences between two people. When you couple up, you’re picking a set of perpetual problems you’ll have with a partner. Instead of shying away, learn how to have healthy conflicts, and how to find resolutions or acceptance. When conflicts arise, always remember to describe yourself and not your partner. The biggest mistake couples make is to raise a complaint with criticism: “You’re so lazy, you never clean up the kitchen.” Our research shows there’s no such thing as constructive criticism in relationships. It will make anyone defensive. Instead, say how you feel about the situation and then state your positive needs: “I’m upset that the kitchen is still a mess, would you please clean it up?” Simply tell your partner how they can shine for you. On the bigger issues, don’t be too quick to try to rush to a resolution. When tension arises, sit together with it and explore it. Ask each other questions, like what’s your dream here? Why is this important to you? Seeing it as an opportunity to listen and learn about each will help soften the space between you, leading to more compassion. Stagnation isn’t insurmountable, there are ways to avoid it. First, it’s not uncommon to hear couples say, “Fun has come to die in our relationship.” But we know from research that our brains need fun in relationships. So make time for it. I knew of this couple who felt they were falling out of love, so they decided to go into their back yard and had a mud fight, rolling around in the dirt. It changed their dynamics completely; they had fun again. Make time for a conversation that involves open-ended questions with longer and winding answers. Ask each other about your dreams; what you’re longing for. Generally, we ask each other lots of big questions at the start of relationships, then we stop. But we’re always evolving. You’d be surprised at how profound the results can be when we just ask bigger questions to connect with each other: it helps us reprioritise and cleanse our relationships, refocusing from trivial tasks into something much more fulfilling. MSgottman.com No person can ever meet all of another’s needs. Some people feel as if they should get everything from their partner – a best friend, a lover, an unfaltering emotional support system – and don’t have intimate friendships. But there is no such thing as The One; the person who will give you everything. I get letters from people who say, “I love this person, the sex is great, we’re emotionally connected, but I don’t know if they’re the one.” The myth of just “knowing” that our person is the person damages people.It ends good relationships. You know if someone is the one when you decide to treat them that way. We don’t talk enough about companionable, healthy, loving relationships that are sexless. If both partners are content with sexlessness, that relationship is fine. If sex is important to you to maintain connection, acknowledge that. I’ve been with my husband for 30 years and it’s really important for us to have that flood of oxytocin; to look at each other while we’re climaxing. But after 10 or 20 years with the same person, how do you bring back the terror and excitement of getting undressed with them all those years ago? You can’t. You have to engineer a sense of risk. We spend so much time sitting on our butts, looking at our screens. Physical passivity creates inertia. We can’t be shocked when nothing happens. So get off that bed. Get out of that room. Get out of the house! Fuck in public! Defining everything as “cheating” sets relationships up to fail. There may be emotional infidelity, there may be crushes, there may be desire for others, there may be getting off to porn or thinking of someone else during sex. But if you define cheating so rigidly, and position it as unforgivable, sustaining a relationship may be difficult. Your partner should not have to hide who they are as a price of admission to be with you, and vice versa. Even if you’re together for 60 years and wind up in the funeral home together, was it a success if you weren’t truly known to each other? Being in a relationship means meeting your partner where they’re at. That can be scary. When you start dating someone, it’s a slow process of peeling back the layers and working out if you can be together. Figuring out what you can tolerate (different kinks, non-monogamy, whatever) is great. Figuring out what you can celebrate is better. EMthestranger.com/savage-love How fortunate we are that we can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel of this terrible virus, which is why my first tip is to shout out, “Hallelujah!” Expressing thanks will put you in a much better mood that is conducive to good sex. Being in a bad mood, or feeling anxious or nervous, can make it more difficult to become aroused. Positive thinking is a turn on. Prolonging the sexual experience is one way to enhance it, so I suggest you take a bubble bath together first, washing and then drying each other. Have some cookies and champagne prepared ahead of time and after your bath, share these delicacies slowly. Only then hop into bed. Many couples use the same sexual positions for the simple reason that they work so they think, why bother experimenting? I suggest you try a new position, but in the back of your mind know that you can always end the session going back to your tried and true position if the new one doesn’t do the trick. There are plenty of resources for finding options: from the Kama Sutra to Sex For Dummies. Usually good sex means both of you have an orgasm as a result of your coupling and as a rule, I think that’s the right way to have sex. But as an experiment, try picking only one of you to have an orgasm with the promise that the other will be the chosen one the next day. See whether the anticipation doesn’t make for a stronger orgasm for the one going second. I know that many people like to talk “dirty” during sex, that for them it is very arousing. But why not try enveloping a sexual encounter with the warm words of loyalty and exclusivity? I think that the security of knowing that you are having sex with a trusted partner will also end up being very arousing.

2/13/2022,"The writer and photographer Caleb Azumah Nelson was born to Ghanaian parents and raised in south-east London. He quit a job at the Apple Store on Regent Street to focus on writing and in 2020 was shortlisted for the BBC short story prize. In February 2021 he published his debut novel, Open Water, which revolves around a love affair between two young black Londoners, a photographer and a dancer. Azumah Nelson was named one of National Book Foundation’s “5 under 35” honorees, and last month Open Water won the Costa first novel award. It’s out now in paperback.  And Breathe… (Almeida, London) I went to see this one-man show, by the poet and playwright Yomi Ṣode, four times. It was perhaps the most accurate and heartrending piece of work I’ve seen about grief. David Jonsson played a multitude of characters, but the main voice is a man in his late 20s or early 30s whose aunt is about to die. He is dealing both with the impending passing but also with the guilt of not feeling as if he’s been present for his family. The show was short, not much over an hour, but it was so agile and full of feeling. Nala Sinephro (Earth, London) Nala Sinephro’s Space 1.8 was one of my favourite albums from last year, so I was really looking forward to her gig in Hackney last November. It ended up being a two-and-a-half-hour improv session that was beyond incredible – one of the most special things I’ve ever been a part of. It was a four-piece – a drummer, a bass player, a sax player, and Sinephro on harp and synths. She was so close to the music, there were times where she seemed to be prostrating towards the instruments. Roy DeCarava (David Zwirner gallery, London) Roy DeCarava is one of my favourite photographers but I’d never seen his work in person, always in monographs or online. So it was really special to go to the opening of his show in Mayfair. All the images are in black and white, showing Harlem in the 1950s and 60s, with a lot of jazz musicians and jazz concerts. He always shot with available light, which lends an ethereal quality to his work. Everyday moments become more significant through his lens. The image of Elvin Jones on the drums, taken in 1961, is probably my favourite. Tatale, London I’m really excited about this restaurant, opening this spring at the Africa Centre in London. The chef, Akwasi Brenya-Mensa, is of Ghanaian descent and I read him saying that Tatale is going to be a hub for conversations set over and around food, which for me is such an important thing. I grew up in quite a big family, and sitting around with lots of people eating food was a really standard thing at home. I’m big into restaurants, to the point where it’s becoming quite a bad habit. If there’s a new place I’m excited about and my partner can’t make it, I’ll end up going by myself. We’re All Alone in This Together by Dave This is probably the album that I listened to the most in the past year. There’s something about the tone in which Dave expresses things, as well as the things he’s expressing, that really connects with me. We’re both from south London, so there’s a shared experience there. This album felt more vulnerable than his previous work and really personal – in one line he says that it has really been about the making of him, and you can really feel that. Heart Attack is the standout track. Summer of Soul (dir Questlove, 2021) This is part concert film, part ode to black music. Questlove masterfully winds a narrative around a series of concerts that took place in Harlem in 1969. There’s real energy to all of the performances, but one that particularly stood out was a young Stevie Wonder. He had real flair, and even at that age you could see that he was already something special. I was really moved by these musicians and totally immersed in their world, which I guess is the power of cinema. Transcendent Kingdom by Yaa Gyasi I read this at the start of 2021, and again a few months ago, and I still can’t get the voice out of my head. It’s about a family across time and continents – they start off as a family of four, but when they move from Ghana to Alabama, four becomes two. What really intrigued me was this idea of the stories within families that don’t emerge until it’s too late. The book is quite slow and meditative, but it’s so beautiful and well told – and more daring than her first book, Homegoing.",Arts/Culture,On my radar: Caleb Azumah Nelson’s cultural highlights,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/12/on-my-radar-caleb-azumah-nelsons-cultural-highlights
2/13/2022,"This was not quite the tale of two halves that was Manchester United’s draw at Burnley and penalty shootout defeat by Middlesbrough. In those last two outings Ralf Rangnick’s men were cruising before the interval and lost the plot after it. Today they did concede again after the tea and oranges but then held firm against a Southampton whose spirit impressed. This was a very differerent Ralph Hasenhüttl side to the one that lost 9-0 in this fixture last season. Instead, United ended with a draw that cannot be categorised as a disaster: their opponents achieved the same result against Manchester City home and away.  The problem, of course, is the congested race for the top four and how this result continues the pattern of inconsistent progress under Rangnick. United will curse how they switched off on 47 minutes to allow Ché Adams to cancel out Jadon Sancho’s opener. Rangnick’s side began with a Marcus Rashford punt into the area that skipped past Cristiano Ronaldo and drew a thumbs-up from the Portuguese. When Sancho’s burst and pass did locate Ronaldo, he rounded the goalkeeper Fraser Forster but his weak shot was hacked clear by Romain Perraud. The goal-saving act by the left-back was soon mirrored at the other end by Luke Shaw. A breathless passage started when Kyle Walker-Peters turned a ball back towards an unmarked Adams. At close range the striker could only shoulder it away from David de Gea and goal and when James Ward-Prowse blazed at the rebound in dived Shaw to block. Soon after that, Sancho ran 50 yards into the visitors’ area but with Rashford and Ronaldo begging him to square a pass he went on his own, and Forster smothered. Before the match Rangnick said Ronaldo, restored to the team in place of Edinson Cavani, had to score more, along with the rest of the forwards. This pre-game exhortation was seen by some as stating the obvious. Really, though, it was a stark message to Ronaldo, Sancho, Rashford and Fernandes that 14 goals in the German’s first 11 matches was paltry for players who draw a large chunk of their salaries for finding the net. Sancho was about to do just this, and could thank Rashford, who provided his second league assist of the season. Fernandes was key, too, his raking ball allowing Rashford to race in along the right: on seeing Sancho at the far post, the cross was perfect, the England international scoring his fourth this term. It was a fine team display up until then. Diogo Dalot and Shaw were sharp at the back, Scott McTominay proved muck-and-nettles from midfield – demonstrated by a challenge on Mohamed Elyounoussi that brought a booking – and Paul Pogba was a silken-skilled bully who bossed the danger area near Southampton’s goal. Hasenhüttl’s side, though, would not be dominated and handed United a scare when Mohammed Salisu’s throw-in was inadvertently flicked on by Pogba for Stuart Armstrong to take aim at De Gea, who saved. January’s Premier League player of the month did the same moments later, when lunging left to stop a low Perraud skimmer. United’s recent league record was draw, win, win, draw, defeat, win. The tale of an indifferent season in microcosm. And now arrived the second-half-itis United are currently suffering, their midfield and rearguard in slumberland as Elyounoussi received the ball and pinged it to Adams. The No 10’s finish, in off De Gea’s far post, was pinpoint. Hasenhüttl jumped on to the pitch in jubilation while Rangnick was stoney-faced. Armando Broja soon skipped into position to fire at De Gea, who turned the effort for a corner. From the set piece Fernandes then went close to heading past his keeper in trying to clear. United did move upfield and Forster had to repel a Maguire prod from Shaw’s free-kick, before the keeper beat away Ronaldo and Dalot attempts. Hasenhüttl’s histrionics were on show again when Armstrong blasted over: no one could blame the manager as it was a golden chance to win it. Broja, too, should have scored when the excellent Elyounoussi slipped him in but the striker’s radar was awry. Maguire’s late header from Shaw’s free-kick so nearly grabbed victory but Forster saved, once more Southampton’s hero.",Sport/Football,Ché Adams strikes to grab point for Southampton at Manchester United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/12/manchester-united-southampton-premier-league-match-report
2/13/2022,"Warrington scored twice in the final 10 minutes to deny Leeds victory in a thrilling Super League contest in which the Rhinos played over an hour with 12 men. The inaugural game of Channel 4’s landmark deal to cover the competition, the first time Super League has been shown on free-to-air television, certainly did not disappoint. Yet after 16 minutes the spectacle looked as though it would be spoiled when Leeds’s James Bentley was sent off on his debut after a dangerous tackle on Gareth Widdop. HThe Rhinos fought admirably to lead at half-time, and heading into the final 10 minutes, they had extended that lead to 10 points.  However, tries from Josh Charnley and Connor Wrench put Warrington ahead with four minutes remaining and despite a commendable effort from Leeds in the dying seconds, the visitors held on to secure victory in Daryl Powell’s first match in charge of the Wolves since switching from Castleford in the off-season. The Wolves took an early lead when Widdop benefited from a Matty Ashton break and when Bentley was dismissed, the second red card in the opening weekend, Leeds’ task looked an uphill one, given how they were already behind on the scoreboard. Back-to-back tries from Zane Tetevano and Matt Prior, both created by fine passes from Brad Dwyer, turned the contest on its ahead and moved Leeds into a 12-4 lead. Warrington reduced that deficit on the stroke of half-time when George Williams’s offload led to a first try for Charnley, with Stefan Ratchford converting to reduce Leeds’s advantage to two at the break. The Rhinos had spent 10 minutes of the first half with 11 men after Dwyer was sent to the sin-bin for another high tackle. But any notion Leeds would wilt with a man disadvantage in the second proved unfounded. They went further ahead when Aidan Sezer’s pinpoint kick was superbly grounded by Ashley Handley and after Rhyse Martin converted, he then added a penalty after Warrington’s Oliver Holmes became the third player to be shown a card. That made it 20-10 in Leeds’s favour, but as they looked destined to hang on, Warrington broke their hearts in devastating fashion. Ratchford’s pass enabled Charnley to cross for his second and after Wrench scythed through with four minutes remaining, Ratchford nervelessly converted from wide out to give the Wolves a dramatic victory.",Sport/Sport,Warrington leave it late for Channel 4 viewers against 12-man Leeds,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/12/leeds-warrington-super-league-match-report
