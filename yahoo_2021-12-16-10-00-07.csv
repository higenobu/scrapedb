12/16/2021,"The latest season of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba, which is focused on the Entertainment District arc, started airing on various streaming platforms earlier this month. It is set in Yoshiwara, a famous real-life red-light district in the Edo period, which is now part of the Taito district in Tokyo. Due to the historical connection, Tokyo’s Edo-Tokyo Museum promoted its Yoshiwara-related artefacts — a painted scroll in this case — with a “Kimetsu No Yaiba” hashtag on Twitter. The tweet described the world of the brothel district as “glamorous and glittering”. However, Japanese netizens are not so happy with that description, owing to the actual meaning of “entertainment district”. The original Japanese word for “entertainment district” is yukaku, which is better understood as “red-light district”. Although Yoshiwara was a legal, licensed brothel district during its time, people now hold deep concerns over the living conditions of prostitutes during that time. 元禄期の吉原の風物を描いた「吉原風俗図屏風」。吉原は歌舞伎やドラマ、漫画でも題材となることが多く、最近ではアニメ #鬼滅の刃 遊郭編 の舞台にもなっています。煌びやかな遊郭の世界をご覧ください。
江戸ゾーン 芝居と遊里コーナーにて12月19日(日)まで展示#江戸東京博物館 pic.twitter.com/X7qKSLUopE — 江戸東京博物館 (@edohakugibochan) December 6, 2021 In response to the museum’s tweet, Japanese Twitter users pointed out the poor choice of adjectives to describe Yoshiwara: “It’s probably ‘glamorous and glittering’ from the perspective of men. But what about the women working in the district? Did you not know that yukaku is also called ‘the suffering world’?” “Demon Slayer not only shows the yukaku as a gorgeous place, but it also depicts the shadows of the district, and the misery of the prostitutes and the illegitimate children born in the district.” “There is nothing glamorous about sexually transmitted diseases, and treating women and children as tools and slaves.” The museum subsequently tweeted an apology, saying that their expression ‘a glamorous and glittering world’ was inappropriate. They also clarified that their exhibits will “present both the facade of Yoshiwara that played a major role in the development of Edo culture, as well as the harsh inner realities of the women forced to sell their bodies for economic reasons.” The tweet comes with an infographic from the museum’s Yoshiwara display, showing how the district operated throughout the day. One of the statements reads, “It was a cruel environment [for the working women] with hardly any time to sleep or eat.” 当館の展示では吉原が江戸文化の形成に大きな役割を果たした「表」の面と経済的な理由から身を売らざるを得なかった遊女たちの苦しい実像という「裏」の面、両面を紹介しています。12月6日の「吉原風俗図屏風」を紹介したツイートで「煌びやかな遊郭の世界」の表現は不適切でした。お詫び申し上げます pic.twitter.com/WdJTBlwYe7 — 江戸東京博物館 (@edohakugibochan) December 8, 2021 Another infographic illustrates the staggering figures of the increasing numbers of prostitutes over the years and less well-to-do prostitutes made up the greater proportion. The infographic is supplemented with photos of Jokanji, a Buddhist temple near Yoshiwara that houses the remains of poor prostitutes in a collective grave. Despite all of the negative factors, Yoshiwara had a great influence on Japan’s arts and culture, which includes the creation of geisha, and fashion trends for kimono design and traditional Japanese hairstyling and makeup. The artistic vibrance of the district also attracted painters, craftsmen, and other artisans, giving Yoshiwara a complicated position in Japanese history.

12/16/2021,"WASHINGTON — Rep. Jim Jordan's office confirmed Wednesday that the Ohio Republican was one of the lawmakers whose text messages to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows were released this week by the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. The acknowledgement comes two days after the Jan. 6 committee made public numerous documents, including text messages, provided to the panel by Meadows. The House committee revealed several text messages sent to Meadows by GOP lawmakers but did not name any of them. Jordan's office said Wednesday that the message cited by the panel on Monday was a forwarded text, and that it was truncated by the committee. “Mr. Jordan forwarded the text to Mr. Meadows and Mr. Meadows certainly knew it was a forward,” Jordan’s spokesman told NBC News on Wednesday. Some smartphones do not specify that a text message has been forwarded. The text message from Jordan to Meadows released by committee on Monday read: ""On January 6, 2021, Vice President Mike Pence, as President of the Senate, should call out all electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all.” Jordan's office said the shortened version misrepresented the content of the text with an ""inadvertently"" placed period. The Jan. 6 committee acknowledged trimming the text before making it public. “The Select Committee is responsible for and regrets the error,” a spokesman told NBC News on Wednesday. The full text read: “On January 6, 2021, Vice President Mike Pence, as President of the Senate, should call out all electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all — in accordance with guidance from founding father Alexander Hamilton and judicial precedence. 'No legislative act,' wrote Alexander Hamilton in Federalist No. 78, 'contrary to the Constitution, can be valid.' The court in Hubbard v. Lowe reinforced this truth: 'That an unconstitutional statute is not a law at all is a proposition no longer open to discussion.' 226 F. 135, 137 (SDNY 1915), appeal dismissed, 242 U.S. 654 (1916). Following this rationale, an unconstitutionally appointed elector, like an unconstitutionally enacted statute, is no elector at all.’” Politico reported on Jordan's text message earlier Wednesday. Joseph Schmitz, a conservative lawyer and one-time national security adviser on former President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, sent the legal theory to Jordan who then passed it on to Meadows, a source familiar with the matter told NBC News. The text reveals another instance of how those in Trump's orbit were pressing the White House to challenge the counting of electoral votes on Jan. 6. Jordan is a close ally of Meadows from their time in Congress and as members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. Jordan has been a staunch Trump ally and was one of the Republican lawmakers tapped by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., to serve on the Jan. 6 committee. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., rejected Jordan and another Republican offered by McCarthy, who later pulled his picks. Pelosi later added two GOP lawmakers — Reps. Liz Cheney, of Wyoming, and Adam Kinzinger, of Illinois — to the nine-member committee. The Jan. 6 committee this week also released texts from three Fox News hosts and Donald Trump Jr. showing they had urged Meadows to get Trump to call off the rioters during the attack on the Capitol. The House voted Tuesday night to refer Meadows to the Justice Department for a potential criminal charge over his refusal to answer questions about the Jan. 6 attack. Lawmakers passed the measure largely along party lines in a 222-208 vote. Cheney and Kinzinger were the only Republicans to cross the aisle and vote with Democrats.",Politics/NBC News,GOP Rep.

12/16/2021,"
 Former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly said downplaying or diminishing the seriousness of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol is something that ""could never have happened"" during his time at the network. ""Fox News is a different place than it was when I was there,"" O'Reilly said Tuesday evening while appearing on Dan Abrams' primetime show on NewsNation. ""I don't follow it that that closely anymore, but when I was there, there was a discipline from management that diminishing the Capitol riot could never have happened. And I'll state that firmly on the record."" O'Reilly had joined Abrams' program to discuss revelations this week that top hosts at Fox, including his former colleagues Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham and Brian Kilmeade, had been texting with then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows during the riot, urging Meadows to convince former President Trump to do something to stop the attack. ""I wouldn't have done it myself,"" O'Reilly said of the text messages the hosts sent Meadows. ""I would have asked the question, 'Say, are you guys going to make a statement? What are you going to do? Looks like things are out of control?' I don't think I would have advocated; that's not what journalists do. But it was in a very intense, quick-breaking situation. So I'm not going to condemn anybody here."" Hannity and Ingraham both defended their texts to Meadows during their nightly programs on Tuesday and played for their audiences portions of their statements the night of the attack. ""I said to Mark Meadows the exact same thing I was saying live on the radio at that time and on TV that night on Jan. 6 and well beyond Jan. 6,"" Hannity said Tuesday. ""Both publicly and privately I said what I believe: that the Jan. 6 breach at the Capitol was a terrible thing. Crimes were committed,"" Ingraham said during the next hour. ""Some people were unfairly hounded and persecuted, but it was not an insurrection. To say anything different is beyond dishonest and it ignores the facts of that day."" After O'Reilly defended Hannity's comments on Jan. 6, Abrams asked him about Tucker Carlson, who hosts the top-rated show in the country, and his production of a controversial miniseries for the network's streaming service focusing on the Jan. 6 attack. Carlson's ""Patriot Purge"" miniseries purports to tell an alternative view of the Jan. 6 attack and features one subject who suggested the incident could have been a so-called ""false flag"" operation. ""I'm not going to comment on that,"" O'Reilly said. ""I haven't watched [Patriot Purge.]"" O'Reilly was forced out of his prime time show on Fox News in 2017 amid allegations of sexual harassment and was eventually replaced in the network's 8 p.m. hour with Carlson. O'Reilly, a close personal friend of Trump for years, has since launched a speaking tour with the former president but has appeared rarely in interviews with mainstream media outlets since his ouster from Fox. Fox declined to comment on O'Reilly's remarks.",U.S./The Hill,Bill O'Reilly: 'Diminishing the Capitol riot could never have happened' while he was at Fox News,https://news.yahoo.com/bill-oreilly-diminishing-capitol-riot-161221847.html
