2/23/2022,"Of all the former secretaries of state under Democratic and Republican presidents, only one is taking to cable news and social media during a moment of peril in Europe to praise Russian President Vladimir Putin and chastise the Biden administration. Mike Pompeo has lauded the Russian strongman over the past month as a “talented,” “savvy,” “capable statesman,” offering his praise during a slew of interviews after his political action committee spent $30,000 on improving his performance in media appearances. “He is a very talented statesman. He has lots of gifts,” Pompeo told Fox News in January. “He was a KGB agent, for goodness sakes. He knows how to use power. We should respect that.” On Monday, Putin declared two regions of eastern Ukraine as “independent” after supporting a violent separatist movement there over the past eight years. Since the fall, he has steadily amassed nearly 200,000 troops along Ukraine’s east, north and south – nearly 70% of Russia’s entire ground force – and in recent days placed battalions in tactical positions for an imminent, full-scale invasion, according to U.S. officials. A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers have traveled to Ukraine in recent weeks to express a unified American voice of support, and are working on legislation that would provide President Joe Biden with new sanctions tools to punish Russia if it further invades the country. Few other former secretaries of state have weighed in on the crisis, and those that have avoided politics. Condoleeza Rice, former secretary of state under President George W. Bush, called Putin “megalomaniacal” in a CNN interview over the weekend. There have been eight U.S. secretaries of state since Putin took power in 1999, including four under Republican presidents — Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, Rex Tillerson and Pompeo — and four under Democratic presidents — Madeleine Albright, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and the current secretary, Antony Blinken. To the contrary, Pompeo has targeted Biden as exemplifying “enormous weakness,” leading “an America on its back, an America that apologizes.” He asserts that Biden’s withdrawal from Afghanistan and response to a ransomware hack of the Colonial pipeline last year contributed to Putin’s confidence. Putin is “very shrewd. Very capable,” Pompeo said in another recent interview with the Center for the National Interest. “I have enormous respect for him – I’ve been criticized for saying that.” In the past, former President Donald Trump’s secretary of state has privately dismissed Ukraine as insignificant in U.S. domestic politics. After an interview with an NPR reporter in 2020, Pompeo, then still secretary, pulled the reporter aside to curse at her for her questions, and demanded she identify Ukraine on an unmarked map. “Do you think Americans care about Ukraine?” he asked her. Pompeo has been visiting key primary states ahead of a potential run for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024. He has worked to increase his media profile since leaving office, losing 90 pounds in six months, joining Fox News as a contributor and staying active on the speakers circuit. His praise of Putin comes amid a debate within the Republican Party over whether Russia is a friend or foe. Major figures in the GOP, including Trump and Fox News host Tucker Carlson, have for years defended Putin and criticized Ukrainian leadership. In yet another recent interview, Pompeo explained that respecting Putin “doesn’t mean we should love him, like him, or bend a knee to him.” “But we shouldn’t treat him as the JV,” Pompeo said. “He is a credible, capable statesman. And that’s why the mistake of not putting deterrence in place over the last year has led to this moment that we’re suffering from today.” On Monday night, after Putin delivered a speech describing Ukraine as a Russian invention, Pompeo did assign blame for the current crisis to the Russians. “Vladimir Putin is the aggressor,” he wrote on Twitter. “The Ukrainians are the victims. We should never shy away from that.”",Politics/Kansas City Star,Only one former secretary of state is praising Putin and criticizing Biden in Ukraine crisis,https://news.yahoo.com/only-one-former-secretary-state-160444530.html
2/23/2022,"Jason Furman said Russia's economy is ""unimportant"" other than gas, The New York Times reported. His comments come as the US and Europe prepare heavy sanctions on Russia if it invades Ukraine. But there are concerns that their plans to punish Moscow will penalize the rest of the world too. Russia's economy is ""incredibly unimportant in the global economy except for oil and gas,"" Jason Furman, a Harvard economist and former advisor to President Barack Obama, told The New York Times. ""It's basically a big gas station,"" he said. His comments come as the West prepares heavy sanctions on Russia if it invades Ukraine. While they have the potential to throw the Russian economy into chaos, these measures could also reverberate to further damage the US, Europe, and the rest of the world as they battle inflation and rising energy prices — a ripple effect that the West hopes to mitigate. On Monday, Moscow declared the independence of two breakaway regions of Ukraine and sent troops there — escalating the prospect of a major war. President Joe Biden has already ordered sanctions on the separatist regions — Donetsk and Luhansk — prohibiting US citizens from engaging in any exports, imports, or new investments in these areas. Despite Russia's size and wealth in raw materials, its economy is more on par with Brazil than with nations like Germany, France, and the UK, according to the latest nominal GDP data from the World Bank. According to the World Bank, Russia's economy is smaller than Italy's and South Korea's, two nations with less than half of Russia's population. But as Furman noted, Russia's oil and gas exports are significant to the world. The European Union imports about 80% of the natural gas it uses, according to the US Energy Information Administration, and Russia accounts for 41% of the natural gas imports and 27% of the oil imports in the continent, according to Eurostat. Compounded with energy prices in the EU surging from 20 euros to 180 euros a megawatt-hour over the past year, the disappearance of those gas and oil imports could spell disaster for the region and the interconnected global economy. Meanwhile, in the US, gas prices have hit a seven-year high, climbing to about $3.50 per gallon on average, while inflation over the past year has grown at its highest rate in 40 years, at 7.5%. On the other hand, Ukraine has also been a major supplier of grain to other regions, sending 40% of its wheat and corn exports to the Middle East and Africa, The Times reported. In response to a potential food crisis in those regions, US Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack said on Saturday that American farmers would increase production and ""step in and help our partners,"" The Associated Press reported. Ukraine accounts for 12% of the world's grain exports and is estimated to provide 16% of global corn exports this year, the AP reported. Vilsack told the outlet he believed that American consumers would largely be unaffected but that Europeans would face ""a different story."" ""You have to look at the backdrop against which this is coming,"" Gregory Daco, the chief economist for consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told The Times. ""There is high inflation, strained supply chains and uncertainty about what central banks are going to do and how insistent price rises are.""

2/23/2022,"Olympic figure skater Nathan Chen was surprised by his mother Hetty Wang during his appearance on Tuesday’s episode of NBC's “Today” show, during which he thanked her for supporting him along his journey to becoming an Olympic champion.

Wang surprised Chen by walking on set with a tray of pizza, only to have Chen place his gold medal around her neck. According to Today, the two had not seen each other since the Olympics.

Chen explained that he placed the medal around his mother’s neck because it “largely” belongs to Wang, as she had been there to support Chen’s skating career since he was 3 years old.

“She’s been with me every single step of the way, and no way I would ever make it to where I am now without her support,” Chen told the hosts of “The Today Show.”

His mother explained that although she was “nervous” about his competitions, she knew what to expect of his performance and that she believed in him.

When asked how his mother sacrificed to help him achieve his Olympic dreams, the 22-year-old explained that after he had switched to his current coach in 2012, his mother would drive him from Utah to California whenever he needed to train.

The mother and son duo eventually moved to Lake Arrowhead, California, so Chen could focus on training closer to his coach, reported Today.

Chen won two medals at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games, including a gold in the men’s single figure skating event and a silver medal in the team event. He became the first Asian American male figure skater to win a gold medal at the Olympics.

2/23/2022,"The measures target Russian banks and sovereign debt, among other steps. One of the worst security crises in Europe in decades is unfolding as Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized sending what he calls peacekeping troops to separatist areas of Donetsk and Luhansk after recognizing them as independent. Weeks of intense diplomacy have so far failed as Moscow calls for security guarantees, including a promise that its neighbor Ukraine will never join NATO, while the United States and its allies offer Putin confidence-building and arms control steps. ""He's setting up a rationale to take more territory by force,"" Biden said at the White House.
