2/3/2022,"Murder in Successville, which ran on BBC Three from 2015-17, was one of the more innovative British comedies of the past decade. A hybrid of sitcom, reality show, spoof and grand-scale prank, it starred King Gary’s Tom Davis as DI Sleet, a homicide detective who was helped by a different celebrity sidekick each week. The twist: the celebrity was not given the script, forcing them to improvise, under Davis’s deliberately off-putting tutelage, through a torrent of ridiculous interactions with suspects, culminating in them being asked to identify the killer. It was a startling flash of bottled chaos that deserves to be cherished. It doesn’t deserve the new US remake, Murderville (Netflix), which hacks off the concept’s eccentric rough edges, then makes a mess of the less interesting show that’s left.  As the sleeker title implies, Murderville streamlines the idea, and it makes one big change that does have a logic to it. The original was set in a town populated by celebrities, played by impressionists. “Gordon Ramsay” was Sleet’s boss, while “Simon Cowell” was the town mayor and so on, which added another layer of absurdity but complicated the format. Lose that, as Murderville does by having ordinary actors playing ordinary characters, and you can focus on each guest’s encounter with the star of the show – Will Arnett, in a crumpled suit and a moustache that refuses to stay stuck on, as unstable detective Terry Seattle. Another less welcome tweak becomes apparent, however, when you look at the guests. The British show favoured structured-reality stars, radio and TV presenters, and girl/boyband singers. Chucking these non actors into an entirely unfamiliar, immersive situation provoked unpredictable reactions. Mark Wright from The Only Way Is Essex was genuinely terrified, while Deborah Meaden from Dragons’ Den maintained her brusque but fair persona and played it straight. Richard Osman from Pointless had to cope with not being the funniest person in the room. Vicky Pattison from Geordie Shore was the funniest person in the room. Murderville flings all that in the bin. Perhaps, the US doesn’t quite have the same depth and diversity as celebrity Britain, so it can’t cast the sort of self-ironising, famous-yet-normal types who made Murder in Successville such a pleasure. With the exception of former NFL running back Marshawn Lynch, the guests are all seasoned actors or comedians (and even Lynch has acted a bit, in Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Westworld). They’re not nearly uncomfortable enough. They’re just pros doing improv. Still, I hoped they’d get a rhythm going with Arnett – replacing the disturbing, hilarious pseudo-bullying of the original with the miraculous plate-spinning feat that is semi-scripted comedy when it clicks. Sadly not. Mediocre comedy is depressing to watch, but mediocre improvisation is excruciating, and almost every Murderville scene is torturous cringe. Arnett just doesn’t have the skills: he is unable to drive the action with any authority, corpses far too often, and has a knack for throwing his guests lines to which there can be no amusing answer. Consequently, all sorts of dead ends and false starts have made the final edit. There are even outright no-nos, such as Lynch looking through the fourth wall to ask the crew for guidance, and Arnett trying to steer a scene back on track by interrupting Sharon Stone and prompting a supporting actor to speak instead. In fairness to Arnett, even the predetermined elements haven’t been properly thought out. Each episode, for instance, has a scene where the celebrity wears a hidden earpiece and must repeat whatever Arnett tells them to say. This old prank has rewarded everyone from Chris Morris to Ant and Dec, but the earpiece-wearer normally embarrasses themselves in front of someone who isn’t in on the joke. Using the gag in a staged scene, where the stooge is talking to an actor, makes no sense. With the too-bland regular cast (Lilan Bowden as a pathologist with no distinguishing characteristics; Haneefah Wood as the police chief who is also Seattle’s weary estranged wife) offering Arnett limited assistance, everything rests on the guests. Sharon Stone is strongly reminiscent of Deborah Meaden with her no-nonsense calm, while Conan O’Brien effortlessly bosses his instalment, making Arnett and everyone else crack up. Kumail Nanjiani’s mix of amiability and sharpness probably works best, creating several nice clashes with Arnett, notably the one where he tries to force him to perform in a Pakistani accent. Even in Murderville’s rare good moments, though, it’s just people we expect to be funny, being quite funny.

2/3/2022,"“There is no embargo on Cuba.” This bold claim – made by Florida senator Marco Rubio on the floor of the US Senate last July – has quickly hardened into conventional wisdom across aisles of US Congress and among Rubio’s base of support in the Cuban diaspora. The US blockade is a myth, a bogeyman for the Communist party of Cuba. “Cuba is not isolated,” Rubio said. Those who say otherwise either “don’t know what they’re talking about … or they’re liars. Those are the only two options.” Here in Havana, though, the isolating effects of the US embargo are impossible to ignore. The docks are half-empty: the US has banned all cruise ships, cultural exchange and educational delegations that once drove the largest industry on the island. The Western Union branches are shuttered: the US has banned all remittances through Cuban firms and their affiliates to the millions of Cuban families that rely on assistance from abroad. The hospitals are understocked: the US embargo has forbidden the export of medical technology with US components, leading to chronic shortages of over-the-counter medicine. Even the internet is a zone of isolation: the US embargo means that Cubans cannot use Zoom, Skype or Microsoft Teams to communicate with the outside world.  In short, the US embargo impacts every aspect of life on the island – and that is the precisely the point. Sixty years ago on this day, President John F Kennedy introduced Proclamation 3447, Embargo on All Trade with Cuba, designed to isolate Cuba and stop the spread of so-called Sino-Soviet Communism “Every possible means should be undertaken promptly to weaken the economic life of Cuba,” the assistant secretary of state, Lester D Mallory, wrote in an April 1960 memo. The goal of the Kennedy administration was clear: “To bring about hunger, desperation and overthrow of government.” Today, Joe Biden lives up to Kennedy’s legacy and the ambitions of his Cuban embargo. Not only has the president refused to undo the extraordinary sanctions imposed by the Trump administration, reneging on his campaign promise to restore diplomatic relations and leaving Cuba on the list of “state sponsors of terrorism”. He has also doubled down on the embargo, tightening restrictions and imposing a host of new sanctions against the Cuban government. Both the Biden administration and its Republican opposition claim that these measures are targeted at the regime, rather than the Cuban people. But the evidence to the contrary is not only anecdotal. The UN estimates that the embargo has cost Cuba over $130bn in damages – costs that are compounded by the penalties imposed by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on Cuba’s allies and investors. Between April 2019 and March 2020 alone, OFAC penalties amounted to over $2.4bn, targeting banks, insurance firms, energy companies and travel agencies alike. The effect of the embargo is therefore both local and global: it cripples the Cuban economy and undermines the multilateral system that the US claims to lead. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports that the embargo has had a “direct impact” on its operations in Cuba, citing costs, losses and damages that have resulted in drastic reduction of agricultural output on the island – despite the fact that FAO is “officially exempted” from the embargo. The UN development program (UNDP) cites its own challenges in the implementation of projects like its Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis, and Malaria in Cuba – in particular, when Toyota Gibraltar Stockholdings was forced to cancel the supply of vehicles to the UNDP office as a result of tightened US restrictions in 2018. And the UN Environmental Program (UNEP) highlights the ways in which the US embargo “not only affects that Caribbean country but also the subregion and the United States itself”. According to the UNEP, the embargo “eliminates” the possibility of regional cooperation on environmental issues and prevents the diffusion of critical technology to drive a green transition on the island. Critics of the embargo often rely on moral claims to make their case. It is no doubt a strong case: by its own admission, the US aims to “starve” the island of Cuba, and it is succeeding. The US coast guard reports that 586 Cubans have attempted to cross the ocean in the first fiscal quarter of 2022 alone, but the US government – despite its clear intention to inflame outward migration – refuses to welcome them. “Allow me to be clear,” the homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, said to Cuban migrants, “if you take to the sea, you will not come to the United States.” But a much broader buffet of arguments is on offer to challenge the Cuban embargo on the occasion of its 60th anniversary. One is legal: Biden has called to “defend the liberal international order”, but his embargo clearly violates the UN charter and the international law it enshrines. Another is geopolitical: for the 29th consecutive year, members of the UN general assembly have voted to end the embargo by an overwhelming vote of 184 to two; with US hegemony on the wane, it can little afford such a flagrant display of unilateral force. And still another argument is democratic: 57% of US voters support lifting the embargo, while only 29% oppose; by enforcing the embargo, Joe Biden has allowed a minority of ageing defectors in southern Florida to dictate the foreign policy of an entire administration. Most of all, though, the embargo fails the test of its own logic. In its comments to the UN general assembly last year, the Biden administration argued that the embargo aims to “support the Cuban people in their quest to determine their own future”. But the Biden administration does not dare to explain how making Cuba poorer, sicker and more isolated supports their quest for self-determination. It is a cornerstone of US foreign policy that growth, wealth, and international integration are pathways to freedom. “Starving” the island of Cuba, then, sounds more like administering torture than paving the way to freedom. In his speech on the Senate floor, Marco Rubio argued that the US embargo is just a scapegoat for the communists of Cuba, a “talking point” for the regime. If that is the case, then, why not lift the embargo and take the talking point away? If communism is a failed system, then why not let it fail on its own terms, and let Cubans see for themselves the true face of their revolution? What is Marco Rubio so afraid of? If we are committed to supporting Cubans’ “quest to determine their own future”, then there is only one way forward: end the embargo, and Cuba finally live.

2/3/2022,"Australia retained the women’s multi-format Ashes trophy in the first of three one-day internationals, holding England short of a paltry first innings of 205 for nine to win by 27 runs in Canberra. After captain Heather Knight won the toss and chose to bowl, England’s seam attack used a lively surface to suffocate Australia’s scoring until wickets came. But the Australian bowlers responded in kind, turning the screw until the thread squeaked, and despite a last-wicket partnership of 24 that briefly threatened a revival, England were 178 all out with five overs to go. The day at Manuka Oval began with a key match-up: Australian opener Alyssa Healy against England attack leader Katherine Brunt, who dismissed her twice for nought in last week’s Test match. It was no surprise that the start was circumspect. Brunt and strike partner Anya Shrubsole conceded just 34 from the first 10 overs, with Shrubsole dismissing Rachel Haynes from a top-edged pull. It was a far cry from the barnstorming starts that are Healy’s trademark.  First-change seamer Kate Cross, unlucky to have gone wicketless in the Test match, bowled Australian captain Meg Lanning in the 17th over with a wicked delivery that leaped inward at the stumps from a wider line, then in the 21st sent a ball the other way to have Healy stumped after wicketkeeper Amy Jones had moved up to stop Healy charging. Between times, left-arm spinner Sophie Ecclestone used flight to draw a return catch and complete the second golden duck of Ellyse Perry’s long one-day career. Australia were 67 for four, scoring at 3.35 per over. Big hitter Tahlia McGrath batted slowly for 14 overs, then was bowled by Brunt for 29 as soon as she started to hit out. Ash Gardner started breezily at a run a ball but ran herself out for 12. Jess Jonassen followed for four. Deliverance came from Beth Mooney, who has made a habit of rescuing Australia from trouble, and batted through until the last ball of the innings to make 73 in a partnership with Alana King of 52. At first, that only looked like the broken-jawed batter helping her team save face. Brunt had taken 3 for 40, Cross 3 for 33, and England only needed four runs an over. But Australia’s 18-year-old quick Darcie Brown ignited the response: first her fast outswinger took Tammy Beaumont’s edge to slip for three, then she was on a hat-trick after beating Knight for pace to hit in front of middle stump. Having made 216 runs in the Test match, Knight had this game’s second golden duck. Quiet overs ticked by and mistakes arrived. Lauren Winfield-Hill tried to pull a ball that wasn’t short enough, hitting a catch to deep midwicket for 13. Jones did the same on 16 with a high full toss from McGrath that the third umpire ruled legal. Jones could complain about luck, but in 17 limited-overs innings against Australia she has a high score of 30 and an average of eight. McGrath followed up with an in-ducker to trap Dunkley in front for five. That left England 83 for 5, needing 143 more to win. The decisive blow came when Nat Sciver, having held things together with her innings of 45, tried to nudge Brown to the leg side and instead popped up a leading edge. The bowler took off in her follow-through and dived to take a sliding return catch. She later pinned Ecclestone lbw to finish her ten overs with 4 for 34. Megan Schutt took her 100th one-day wicket for Australia when dismissing Winfield-Hill, before bowling a perfect leg-cutter that beat Danni Wyatt’s outside edge to hit the top of her off stump. Shrubsole was bowled behind her legs trying to lap-sweep Jonassen, when she only needed to support Brunt who was batting nicely. While Cross hit some hard drives in whittling the required runs down from 52 to 28, the target was too distant. Australia had three false alarms for the last wicket, with a dropped catch, a missed run-out, and an overturned review. But eventually Jonassen held a low return catch, and Mooney’s work was not in vain. England can still tie the series with two games to play, but the trophy will stay.",Sport/Sport,Australia bowlers skittle out England in first ODI to retain women’s Ashes ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/03/australia-bowlers-skittle-out-england-in-first-odi-to-retain-womens-ashes-cricket

The energy regulator, Ofgem, lifted the maximum rate that suppliers can charge for an average dual-fuel energy tariff by £693 , to reflect the fourfold increase in energy market prices over the last year.  The news came as the government prepared to announce a package of measures to counter the cost of fuel bills for poorer households. The second major increase in energy bills in six months, and the largest on record, is expected to drive millions of households into fuel poverty for the first time. The price cap increase is calculated by Ofgem based on the costs faced by suppliers, including buying energy from the wholesale market and levies for maintaining energy network infrastructure and renewable energy projects.

2/3/2022,"Haley Hodges was working as a temp at a medical staffing agency in Iowa when she found out there were complications with her pregnancy and she was forced to cancel a few shifts. The cancellations led to her being placed on probation and her wages being slashed. The pandemic has led to a huge surge in temporary hiring, according to a report by the National Employment Law Project (NELP) that highlights the struggles many of those workers face.  “I was struggling with pre-eclampsia [a pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure] and I had made my employer aware that my pregnancy had become high risk. We agreed I would continue to work until I couldn’t,” said Hodges. After her obstetrician called her into the hospital to induce labor, she called her agency and informed them what was going on. They seemed understanding at the time, she said. “It wasn’t until after [the baby] was born that I was informed that I would be placed on probation for having to cancel the remainder of my scheduled shifts for six months,” said Hodges. “My wage would be cut down by $6 an hour and I wasn’t allowed to call in or cancel shifts during probation or I would be terminated.” She worked through the probation period at the reduced wage because she couldn’t afford to lose the job or find another after just having a baby. Hodges’ experience is not an isolated case. NELP’s report details the rapid growth of temp work during the pandemic and the extent to which these workers face low wages, retaliation and wage theft and are misled by staffing agencies about pay or the temp-to-hire nature of their positions. From April 2020 to October 2021, temporary work in the US grew at 2.5 times the rate of all other private sector industries. Revenue in the US staffing industry is projected to have grown by a record 16% in 2021 to $157.4bn. “Sectors where temp work is highly prevalent, like warehousing, are growing e-commerce, and then there’s also industry organizing to grow temp work in sectors like retail,” said Maya Pinto, a senior researcher and policy analyst at NELP and a co-author of the report. “The US lags way behind other industrialized nations in regulating temp work. That lack of regulation has left an opening for the largest employers in the US and sectors like warehousing, manufacturing, and increasingly in retail, to use temporary agencies to squeeze more from workers.” Efforts are being made to give temp workers more rights. Representatives Emanuel Cleaver and Joe Kennedy’s Restoring Worker Power Act is set to be reintroduced in Congress soon and, if passed, would regulate the temp industry and provide temp workers with rights such as pay equity and paths to permanent hiring. Massachusetts, Illinois, California, Washington, and New York City have all passed legislation to regulate temp work. Mississippi and New Jersey introduced such bills this year. In the meantime, the army of temp workers keeps growing. An estimated 13 million to 16 million US workers are hired through staffing agencies annually, according to industry estimates. In December 2021, 2.8 million Americans were employed as temporary help and through staffing agencies. Included in the NELP report is a survey of 1,337 temporary workers in 47 states conducted by Temp Worker Justice, with results revealing the harrowing realities of poverty and abuse these workers regularly face on the job. From 1992 to 2014, Reynalda Cruz worked on a regular basis for temporary staffing agencies in the New Brunswick, New Jersey, area, before taking on a role as an organizer for New Labor, a workplace justice organization based in New Jersey. Cruz said that as a temp worker she, and many other workers, had to work multiple jobs due to the inconsistency of work availability and schedules through staffing agencies. She also had $50 or more deducted from her weekly paychecks to cover the transportation the temp agency provided from its office to work sites. “There were some instances where I was left abandoned at the workplace because they didn’t pick me up or they came late to get me and other workers there. Sometimes they brought us to workplaces and we wouldn’t be needed, but would be forced to wait four to five hours in the cafeteria for the temp agency transportation to pick us up, and none of that time was paid,” said Cruz. “Also they make you show up early, they don’t come to pick you up at your house so you get there at six in the morning and wait until they send you out that day, and you aren’t paid for that time.” Temp workers are more than twice as likely to be paid poverty wages compared to workers in all industries. These workers are often paid less than their direct hire counterparts doing the same work. Staffing and temp agencies receive a cut of an hourly fee they charge host employers, which can range from 30% to more than 150% of the wages the worker receives. In other findings, NELP reports: 36% of workers reported they or their dependents relied on some form of government assistance while they worked through a staffing agency. 24% of workers reported experiencing wage theft through a staffing agency, in which they were paid less than minimum wage, not paid overtime, or not paid the proper amount forhours they worked. 17% of workers reported suffering an illness or injury on the job, and 41% of those workers said they had to cover the costs of medical care themselves. 24% of temp workers said they have never received safety training prior to beginning a temp position, and 23% said they only sometimes received safety training. 80% of workers reported interest in joining a worker organization such as a union to improve working conditions. 71% of workers reported experiencing retaliation for raising workplace concerns to their management. The survey also found high rates of racial, gender, and age discrimination in temp jobs. Workers also reported that staffing agencies misled them about the chances of being hired permanently or about pay. John Martinez of Orange county, California, started working through a temp staffing agency in October 2021, working inventory for companies such as Oakley. The staffing agency started paying him late a few weeks into his first assignment and he continued having issues in resolving the late pay with the agency in his second temp assignment. “I stopped going because I wasn’t being paid,” said Martinez, who ended up taking a lower-paying job closer to home. “I would have liked to have stayed at Oakley, but my gut said ditch this staffing agency.” Temp workers are often used by employers to replace workers on strike or to deter organizing efforts: Nissan relied on temp workers as the company fought off unionizing efforts by the United Auto Workers and Kroger used temporary workers during a grocery worker strike in Colorado. Though temp jobs are often marketed as an opportunity to be hired directly by an employer, 35% of workers reported their current temp assignment had lasted more than one year and 18% reported their current temp assignment surpassed two years in duration. The vast majority of workers, 72%, reported they have never been hired into a permanent position from a temp position. “That long-term perma-temping is how the industry makes money and that’s why they have these bondage fees charged to host employers to control workers from ever leaving,” said Dave Desario, director of Temp Worker Justice and a contributor to the report. “It’s also why agencies present the idea of temp-to-perm positions, because that convinces people to work for substandard wages because they think something better is on the horizon, without knowing how their movement in the job market is controlled and limited.” ",News/US news,Underpaid and misled: how staffing agencies manipulate temps,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/03/temp-workers-underpaid-manipulated-report
2/3/2022,"“Oh, nice!” says a father to his son when he learns a package has arrived for him. The son asks what it is. “Well, ha, ha, you’re probably going to think your old man’s lost his damned mind. It’s called Finaplix. Trenbolone acetate. It’s a cattle steroid. They give it to heifers to beef them up before slaughter.” The father doesn’t have an appointment at an abattoir but with a photographer, who will capture him smothered in baby oil “half-snarling and half-beaming” in black bikini briefs as he poses for the final stage of the Body You Choose competition. At the age of 55, he has become a bodybuilder. If the son thinks he has lost his mind, he keeps it to himself.  My Father’s Diet, Adrian Nathan West’s debut novel, is slim, sad, comic and sharply observed; it is set among the forlorn malls and soulless suburbs of the American heartland. A fractured family – husband remarried; wife in a relationship; son at college – float in and out of each other’s lives, as cool and listless as the shoppers in those empty malls. The son details, with a dispassionate eye, the changes visible in his father, who suddenly walks back into his estranged son’s life while undertaking an ill-advised search for meaning. In his enthusiasm, he fails to notice his son’s own quiet crisis. The father cuts quite a figure, “tall, with a splayed, reclining stance that brought prominence to his round belly”. From the first page, he memorably fills the frame. “His large, gold-framed glasses gave his eyes a tint of amber. They rested halfway down an unusually shaped nose like a seahorse’s snout. […] They caused him a lot of trouble, and were as often in his hands as on his face.” It is a lovely, living portrait. We get to know him more intimately still; his changing body, his developing habits, his failed relationships. The minor characters are eye-catching, too. There is obese Jerry: “His body was pristine like an egg, of an immutable porcelain white untarnished by hair, rolls, or freckles.” There is creeping Kent Minter: “a short, grey-haired figure with a mealy scarlet face, gelid blue eyes, and disconcertingly white teeth”. West, a superb translator by profession – his translation of When We Cease to Understand the World by Benjamín Labatut was shortlisted for the International Booker prize – writes surgically precise prose. The young man notes his father’s verbal quirks and describes his peculiar gait with the detachment of a doctor examining his patient. When not accompanying his father to and from the gym, the son sits alone in his room and stares at the wall. He dreams of a different life: “My only ambition, from early youth, had been to go somewhere else.” It doesn’t help that his idea of somewhere else is a fiction: the France of trenchcoats and filterless Gitanes. The US small-town atmosphere is well evoked, uncomfortably so: sidewalks that lead nowhere, ugly street signs, food that is either “fried or smothered with cheese” – even the red wine has a “faintly mucosal texture”. It’s a long way from Paris. Sadly, we never learn the result of the Body You Choose competition. It is hard to imagine it will make much of a difference. In fact, the last we see of the father, he is gorging on junk food while the son looks mournfully on. It is one of many affecting scenes. West’s achievement, in this subtle and delightful book, is to have rendered failure in strikingly handsome terms.  My Father’s Diet by Adrian Nathan West is published by And Other Stories (£10).

2/3/2022,"First came the heavy snow in late December that blanketed Seattle and the surrounding area. Then the torrential rain and flooding hit in early January. One by one, four of the region’s main mountain passes were deemed impassable, and a 20-mile stretch of Interstate 5 south of Seattle was closed. It was the first time all five had been closed in more than a decade, leaving the Seattle area virtually cut off from cross-state travel.  But it was simply the latest in a series of extreme weather events that have pummeled the Pacific north-west over the past year. In the typically mild-weathered state of Washington alone, it began with heavy snowfall last February, followed by dry, scorching temperatures over the summer that left more than 100 people dead, and then a record-breaking fall rain in the Seattle area. Now, with more intense extreme weather expected in the years ahead, driven by the climate crisis, a bipartisan assortment of Washington state lawmakers has simultaneously introduced a handful of bills this legislative session that, rather than focusing on mitigation and emission reduction, focus on climate adaptation. From a proposal to establish a grant program for farmers and ranchers facing damage from flooding and other natural disasters, to adding climate resiliency planning to water system plans, these innovations are intended to prepare the state for the challenges ahead. “I just think we’re definitely seeing much more extreme weather events and this is going to become the norm, not the one-off,” said Washington senator Mark Mullet, a Democrat, who introduced the proposal to add air conditioners. He said the legislation was inspired by a conversation with a local firefighter who recalled going on three different calls during the heat dome in late June to homes for seniors and finding residents had died from the heat. But these proposals also reflect a broader trend taking shape in the last five years, in which the climatemk movement has increasingly recognized the importance of adaptation, explained Aseem Prakash, professor of political science at the University of Washington and director of the Center for Environmental Politics. The recent Glasgow climate pact doubled the proportion of climate funds earmarked for adaptation. And in October, the Biden administration released climate adaptation and resilience plans that included building supply chain resiliency and increasing protections for workers and communities when it comes to climate change. Prakash explained that even if we immediately start drastically reducing emissions, the effects of the climate crisis are already being felt. “So we have to adapt. I think the climate movement realizes this political and moral necessity to adapt,” he said. “And also, whenever we have floods, extreme heat waves, who suffers? It’s really the poor people, the underprivileged. So there is also a very important climate justice component.” Justin Allegro, director of state government relations for The Nature Conservancy in Washington, said it’s important that it doesn’t become an either-or situation. “It doesn’t make sense to only invest in one strategy,” he said. “We know that the impacts of climate change are going to continue to happen and there’s so much we can do as a state to better prepare and better respond and better create resiliency. And at the same time, every effort to fundamentally reduce emissions quickly and rapidly and equitably is something that we need to do.” In Washington state, Representative Mari Leavitt, a Democrat, introduced a proposal that would create a grant program to help local jurisdictions and federally recognized tribes with the added costs associated with extremely hot or cold weather, as well as unhealthy air quality due to wildfires. She explained that the grants would be flexible to accommodate each area’s distinct needs, but could be used for such things as adding additional cooling shelters and HVAC systems, or even simply providing more fans and water for those in need. “Those extreme weather events will continue,” she said. “And we just weren’t ready and the resources weren’t available, so cooling centers were getting open later, and for limited periods of time.” She gave the example of a cooling center in Lakewood, Washington, about 40 miles south-west of Seattle, which wasn’t set up until a few days after the heatwave started and despite firefighters trying to drop people off in the morning, didn’t open its doors until noon. “I asked the question, ‘Why did it take so long?’ The response I got back was, ‘We were trying to figure out the resources in order to open,’” she said. Another proposal being considered is the outdoor recreation and climate adaptation (Orca) plan, which would direct the projected $4.4bn in revenue between 2023 and 2032 through the state’s recently passed Climate Commitment Act to climate adaptation and outdoor recreation. Currently, the majority of those funds are designated to emission-reducing transportation programs, given the central role it plays in the state’s greenhouse gas emissions. Washington representative Mary Dye, a Republican who is behind the Orca plan, said instead the funds should be used for such things as building structures to protect communities from catastrophic floods and improving forest health to reduce wildfires. “I think that you have to get real and be honest and do good things today that will help our state really be able to adapt to the things that are before us,” she said. But these proposals are still fairly targeted and, apart from Orca, do not have a huge price tag, explained Prakash. “I hope it comes up even more forcefully, because this is an issue we have to confront,” he said. “And this is not to say we should not mitigate. We should certainly mitigate. But we also have to start taking adaptation more seriously, which we haven’t.” Nick Bond, the Washington state climatologist, said it’s clear the state could have done a better job when it came to responding to these extreme weather events. He said: “Hopefully we can learn from it so that when the next one comes along there won’t be as much loss of life, and to figure out just what we can do to reach those folks that don’t have the resources to get themselves out of a threatening situation.”",News/Environment,‘We have to adapt’: US Pacific north-west weighs plans to cope with extreme weather,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/03/pacific-north-west-extreme-weather-plans
2/3/2022,"Aretired police chief and self-described Reagan Republican with decades of public service, Leonard Moty checked all the boxes to represent his community in one of California’s most conservative counties. But on Tuesday, voters ousted Moty, handing control of the Shasta county board of supervisors to a group aligned with local militia members. The election followed nearly two years of threats and increasing hostility toward the longtime supervisor and his moderate colleagues in response to pandemic health restrictions.  While it’s not yet clear who will replace Moty, the two candidates in the lead attended a celebration Tuesday with members of an area militia group, the Sacramento Bee reported. The recall is a win for the ultraconservative movement in Shasta county, which has fought against moderate Republican officials and sought to gain a foothold in local government in this rural part of northern California. It also highlights a phenomenon that extends far beyond the region, as experts warn the pandemic and eroding trust in US institutions has fueled extremism in local politics and hostility against officials that could reshape governments from school boards to county supervisors to Congress. “I think it’s going to be a change in our politics. I think we’re going to shift more to the alt-right side of things,” Moty said on Wednesday. “I really thought my community would step up to the plate and they didn’t and that’s very discouraging.” Located more than two hours from California’s more densely populated state capital, Sacramento, Shasta county has long been a conservative bastion and home to a thriving State of Jefferson movement, which advocates for succession from California and the formation of a new state. But it was also the sort of place where people could work through their differences to achieve common goals, said Moty, who had served as a supervisor since 2009. After the pandemic took hold in 2020 and the governor instituted lockdown measures, however, many residents were outraged by the restrictions and what they viewed as the failure of county officials to stand up to the state government. Shasta county was among the least restrictive in California, Moty said, but residents unhappy about state rules and mask requirements began showing up in meetings in large numbers. Moty and other supervisors were soon subjected to levels of anger and hostility once reserved for state officials, in what Lisa Pruitt, a rural law expert at the University of California, Davis, describes as a trickling down effect. “There’s a lot of pent up anger by a lot of people in rural and quasi-rural places that they’re not getting a fair shake from the government,” she said. “Most of that has been directed at state government. The anger at state officials is now trickling down at local officials because people think ‘my local officials aren’t doing enough.’” Carlos Zapata, a local militia member who helped organize the recall efforts, in 2020 told the board there could be blood in the streets if the supervisors didn’t reject state health rules such as mask requirements. “This is a warning for what’s coming. It’s not going to be peaceful much longer. It’s going to be real … I’ve been in combat and I never wanted to go back again, but I’m telling you what – I will to stay in this country. If it has to be against our own citizens, it will happen. And there’s a million people like me, and you won’t stop us,” he said. The rhetoric was a marked change from anything Moty had seen while in office. “This is not the community I grew up in, I was surprised people would make sort of veiled threats toward public officials and push the envelope,” he said. Disruptions and threatening rhetoric have been seen in public meetings across the country in what experts view as an alarming development. In Oregon, a county commission moved to virtual meetings last month due to anti-mask protesters. A parent in Virginia was arrested after threatening to bring guns if officials didn’t make masks optional. “Distrust in government has permeated the most local levels,” said Colin Clarke, a terrorism expert. “I’m familiar with the indicators of extremism and radicalization. I see them in places I never expected to see them. If you had told me as terrorism expert I’d be talking about school boards, I’d have said you’re crazy.” Anti-government extremists have utilized fears around the pandemic as a recruiting tool, Clarke said. “The whole pandemic was really tailor made to far-right extremists and they’re getting a lot of mileage out of it.” Politics in Shasta county has only become more hostile and contentious. In 2020, voters elected a new supervisor, Patrick Jones, who has been critical of Moty and other supervisors. In January 2020, Jones and Supervisor Les Baugh opened the doors to the supervisors’ chambers and allowed members of the public into what was supposed to be a virtual meeting due to Covid cases. Moty has accused Jones, who has been a vocal supporter of the recall, of riling up the public. Jones did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. He told KQED: “We’ve been demonized as radicals and various things like this. We are not. We are just simply business owners. We’re mothers, we’re fathers, we’re grandmothers, we’re grandfathers – and we want to return to a county where we grew up: a safe, prosperous county that we can be proud of.” The board elected to hold a meeting last month virtually due to rising Covid cases and threats against Moty and other supervisors. The Shasta county sheriff’s office is investigating what it described as credible threats against Moty and two other board members. One person told Moty that bullets are expensive, but “ropes are reusable”. The Redding Record Searchlight reported this week that an election official said they had been subjected to bullying in the lead up to the election. Meanwhile, money poured into the county in support of the recall from an outsider, a millionaire, Reverge Anselmo. His $400,000 donation to the gathering committee in the recall is believed to be one of the largest in the county. Polling numbers on Wednesday showed 52% of voters opted to recall Moty. The success of the recall will likely set up more conflict between the local government and the state government, Pruitt said. Moty is done with politics, he says. He plans to stay in Shasta county “for now”, but worries for the future of the area and that it could become a haven for those with extremist views. For many Shasta county citizens, he said, “They’re gonna get a rude awakening.”",News/US news,Northern California county on track to be run by militia-aligned group,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/03/california-county-controlled-by-militia-group

2/3/2022,"At the heart of the High Tatras mountain range, this resort has great facilities, spectacular views and a selection of slopes suitable for anyone from families with small children to those seeking a bit of adrenaline. It has the highest and steepest slope in Slovakia among its 12km of pistes (a 6.5km slope down from 2,196 metres). There are plenty of great restaurants and accommodation options, including the very picturesque and grand Hotel Lomnica (doubles from €140 B&B). With two cable cars to some of the most scenic vista points in the High Tatras, a sledge run, hiking trails and numerous spas, there is plenty to do away from the slopes too. Excellent value for money.skiresort.infoErika  The small resorts in the lakes around Vuokatti in Finland are often ignored by experienced skiers. But the pristine slopes, with their beautiful powder and lack of crowds, feel like Europe’s best kept secret. There are only a few hours of light each day in mid-winter, so some slopes are floodlit – if you’re lucky you’ll descend under the Northern Lights. And what the 11km of slopes lack in precipitous drops, they more than make up for with dog-sled safaris, snowshoe hiking, ice-skating, and of course cross-country skiing. Still desperate to get the pulse racing? Try a sauna and a dip in an icy lake.skiresort.infoEmma Foppolo, a 90-minute drive north of Bergamo is at the bottom of a valley where the pistes are extremely accessible. With seven ski lifts and 47km of pistes with different levels of difficulty there is something for all ability levels. Ski school is great fun and reasonably priced. If you like cross-country skiing then there is an easy loop of about 3km in the Convento area. Snowboarders are well catered for too. Leisure facilities include shopping, a spa and an ice-skating rink. This is a fabulous resort for a range of skiing abilities, easy to reach from the UK with fabulous snow conditions and often sunshine. Ski passes (adult from €23 a day) can also be used in nearby San Simone and Carona.bremboski.itJennifer Hocknull A gondola takes you up to the edge of the Austrian Alps, with sweeping views over Bavaria from the top. Lovely open skiing in a bowl at the summit of the gondola, served by a quick, six-person chairlift, with a long, tree-lined descent on the other side. It sits in the Tannheim valley, just up from the Haldensee lake, on which you can skate. Far fewer people than the views and the skiing should attract – and for a fraction of the price of the Austrian super-resorts located an hour away.tyrol.comDavid Fügen is the first ski resort you come to heading up the Ziller valley towards Mayrhofen in Austria. Jump off the Zillertalbahn (the train runs between Jenbach and Mayrhofen), take a 10-minute bus ride and soon you are heading up the Spieljochbahn. There are easy beginner-friendly slopes at the top but also, for confident skiers, a superb 7km valley run back to the village. Even more challenging is the black run down to the Panoramabahn Geols gondolas; it’s great to stop at the small hut half way down for coffee or lunch before trying the unpisted ski route nearby. Your lift pass also covers the bigger (and busier) resorts of Hochfügen-Kaltenbach, Zell am Ziller, Mayrhofen and Hintertux.spieljochbahn.atDavid Coombs This is a very small and local ski resort in central Sweden on the shores of Lake Storsjön with two lifts and 1km of slopes for beginners and intermediates, a day pass costing about SEK150 (£12), and ski hire easily available. This a top pick for a quiet beginners’ ski weekend, and if cross-country skiing is more your thing head over to the ski stadium, a 30-minute walk from the town centre. Östersund is a fun university city with excellent bars for the après scene and picturesque chalets with an abundance of traditional features to make a scenic ending to a magical weekend off the beaten track.skiresort.infoJordan To most Brits, skiing in the Italian Dolomites means a trip to one of the many resorts forming part of the famous Sella Ronda, a huge but frequently crowded network of pistes encircling the striking Sella massif. Instead, venture south of this circuit, into the heart of the Veneto region’s mountains, and you’ll find a choice of smaller resorts with the same glorious Dolomite views and varied pistes but fewer crowds. My personal favourite is Falcade, part of the San Pellegrino ski area (67 km of pistes), and situated just two hours’ drive from Treviso airport. €50-55 gets you a day pass. The long black pistes, which would be red in many resorts, are particularly excellent.skiresort.infoMatt Bilyard  Guardian Travel readers' tips Every week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

To enter the latest competition visit the readers' tips homepage - This tiny Swiss resort has spectacular views from Mont Blanc to Grand Combin. It’s so much cheaper than its bigger neighbours such as Les Portes du Soleil. We found a surprisingly wide range of empty pistes and virtually no queues outside the Christmas week. It is the birthplace of Jérémie Heitz, who learned his world-beating freeride skills in the steep bowls of powder. If you miss the crowded pistes, queues and cable-car crushes, try Vallorcine (20 minutes away) or Verbier (35 minutes away).

Martigny station, which links to Geneva in under two hours and beyond, is very nearby.skiresort.infoThomas Godfrey La Clusaz is an attractive French village in the Haute-Savoie, within an hour of Geneva airport. Not being a particularly high resort it’s quite easy to get to. It’s the hometown of famous freeskier Candide Thovex, whose amazing point of view films are all over YouTube. We found La Clusaz to be popular with families, groups and couples because there is such a wide variety of runs and accommodation, ranging from around €130 per night per couple. It’s a traditional feeling place with a mixture of old and tasteful new buildings. The ski area is a good mix of blue, red and black runs, with a snowpark and plenty of off-piste for those with the skill and energy. There are excellent restaurants and bars on and off the slopes and the good old 8 à Huit supermarket for those who are self-catering.laclusaz.comCarolyn Massey It’s wonderful to travel to this resort via Nice, from where it’s a couple of hours by taxi or bus through beautiful scenery to the resort in the Alpes-Maritimes. Accommodation is mostly self-catered, but that’s OK because there are plenty of good spots to eat on and off the mountain and the place is not as expensive as the larger, better known French ski areas. The ski area is not massive but it is varied, fun, well groomed and very pretty.isola2000.comDelyth Jones",Lifestyle/Travel,"Fantastic slopes but not so steep: readers’ pick of smaller, good value ski resorts in Europe",https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/feb/03/fantastic-slopes-but-not-so-steep-readers-pick-of-smaller-good-value-ski-resorts-in-europe
2/3/2022,"Good things come to those who wait. “Are you ready to go in?” Nova Twins guitarist and vocalist Amy Love asks, safe in the knowledge that some of the people jammed in front of the stage have had tickets to this show for more than two years. Having put out their debut album Who Are the Girls? weeks before the UK’s first Covid lockdown, the hype around Nova Twins was kept at a simmer by the feeling that, with live shows largely on the shelf, a key ingredient was missing. Here, with their neon-punk stage gear lit up in striking pinks and greens, everything falls into place.  A good rock band is a loud rock band and Nova Twins might be the loudest rock band in the UK. In a packed room, with a ceiling so low that at one point a crowd surfer appears to be walking across it, they fill every available inch of space with finely tuned, bassy heaviness. Love’s leads duck and weave against Georgia South’s undulating bass on the exhilarating opener Antagonist, the duo’s enormous pedal boards twinkling at their feet like prop cities ready for the Godzilla treatment. Backed only by a touring drummer, they dredge remarkable sounds from their instruments in the style of Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello, putting serious chops and technical wizardry to use on riffs that swerve between crushing heft and glitchy Prodigy-style blowouts. The thunderous precision of South’s work during the one-two of Play Fair and Vortex is a little like someone stopping to calculate the trajectory of the perfect swing before hitting you with a baseball bat. Their latest single KMB – played live tonight for the first time – pairs Love’s charismatic Missy Elliott-esque flow and a monster hook with an addictive bassline, suggesting that there are further exciting twists to come on their second album. The title of Who Are the Girls? repurposed a question that followed Love and South around as women of colour in a scene still dominated by white dudes. Their answer is compelling: this is what the future looks and sounds like.",Arts/Music,"Nova Twins review – the loudest, most exciting new rock band in the UK",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/03/nova-twins-review-moon-cardiff
2/3/2022,"More than 150,000 people have waited in an ambulance for at least half an hour to be admitted to hospital in England this winter to date, higher than at any time in the past five years. NHS England figures published on Wednesday show that one-in five patients have waited 30 minutes or more in ambulances before being admitted in the first nine weeks of winter.  The absolute figure – 151,798 – exceeds the highest levels in recent years – 133,000 at the same stage of winter 2019-20 – by 14%. The number of ambulances waiting 60 minutes in the winter to date now stands at 60,687, up 82% on the past two winters and by far the highest figure in the past five years for which data is available. The proportion of people waiting is also higher than in previous winters: whereas between 3% and 4% of patients waited an hour or more in the previous four winters, that figure stands at 8% this winter to date, or one in every 12. Separate NHS figures showed that staff absences were down slightly compared to the previous week, but remained high, with 70,000 workers off sick across England on an average day. The number of NHS staff off due to Covid reasons also dipped slightly to about 26,000, representing more than a third of total absences. NHS England’s national medical director, Prof Stephen Powis, said: “We still had around 70,000 NHS staff off sick each day last week, as the number of ambulances taking patients to A&E was up again on the previous seven days, making it the busiest week since the start of December. “Despite this, hard-working staff are doing everything possible to get people home to their loved ones and out of hospital safely, as hundreds more beds were freed up each day compared to the week before – all while delivering as many routine checks and procedures as possible, including vital diagnostic checks, as staff continue to make inroads delivering treatments disrupted by Covid.”",News/Society,Ambulance wait figures outside hospitals in England highest for five years,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/03/ambulance-wait-figures-outside-hospitals-in-england-highest-for-five-years
2/3/2022,"Malcolm Turnbull has accused Scott Morrison of “a diplomatic debacle of the first order” after new emails showed Australian defence officials reported “good progress” on the French submarine project just two weeks before the deal was cancelled. The former prime minister said the emails – first revealed by Guardian Australia on Monday – showed that “far from the French being aware the project was going to be cancelled, they were being told the project was in good shape”.  The defence minister, Peter Dutton, hit back at Turnbull, telling the ABC’s 7.30 program “there was no lying to the French” about the now-scrapped project and his job was not “to please the French government or former prime ministers”. Documents obtained under freedom of information laws show Australia’s defence leadership received positive advice about the project, just weeks before Australia unveiled the Aukus pact in mid-September. The US and the UK are now pledging to help Australia acquire nuclear-powered submarines. The defence department secretary, Greg Moriarty, promised in an email to colleagues on 30 August to “ensure that the good progress to date is part of the advice we take to government”. He said it would also be expressed in a video link meeting between Australian and French defence and foreign affairs ministers the same day. Three days earlier, Gregory Sammut, the defence department’s general manager of submarines, told Moriarty that France’s Naval Group’s offer for the next phase of work was “affordable and acceptable”. Turnbull and Dutton appeared on ABC TV on Thursday night to discuss the emails, which the 7.30 program had also obtained under FoI. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Turnbull said the emails confirm that the submarine program for the new Attack-class submarines “was on track, was in good shape, was progressing well, and was well within its budget”. Turnbull – who announced the deal with France when he was prime minister – said it was “extraordinary” that a project that was on track was “blown up” by the Morrison government. He said Morrison – who he increasingly criticises – had failed to be “truthful and honest”, which had damaged Australia’s diplomatic relationships. “Look, regardless of what you think about the submarines, this was a diplomatic debacle of the first order and the consequences being that it has undermined Australia’s honour, security and sovereignty,” Turnbull said. Dutton said the emails needed to be viewed in context. He said the discussions about switching to nuclear-powered submarine option were “compartmentalised” within the defence department. “There were a single digit number of people who had access to what was a very high level discussion and decision-making process within the government,” he said. Another tranche of documents obtained by Guardian Australia in December showed a defence department investigation into the option of nuclear-powered submarines, launched in 2020, was to be handled on a “strictly need-to-know basis”. Dutton said the government had acted on advice from Moriarty and the chief of the defence force, Angus Campbell, “that a diesel-electric submarine was not going to cut it and would not provide the defences for our nation into the 2030s and 2040s”. “We’ve taken the decision based on the expert advice that is in our country’s best interests and I think the French have moved on,” he told the ABC 7.30 chief political correspondent, Laura Tingle. “You and the ABC haven’t. And the Guardian. And Malcolm.” Labor’s defence spokesperson, Brendan O’Connor, said the government had “botched the future submarines process, while also mishandling the diplomatic side and subsequent fallout from the Aukus announcement”. “While Labor supports the Aukus deal, it shouldn’t detract from this government’s constant bungling of defence contracts,” O’Connor said. “We hope the Aukus agreement, which is still yet to deliver any contracts, will be handled with a lot more care.”",News/Australia news,‘A diplomatic debacle of the first order’: Malcolm Turnbull savages Scott Morrison over scuttling of French submarine deal,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/03/a-diplomatic-debacle-of-the-first-order-malcolm-turnbull-savages-scott-morrison-over-scuttling-of-french-submarine-deal
