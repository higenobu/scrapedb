12/13/2021,"Fast bowler Josh Hazlewood will miss the second Ashes Test against England with a side injury he picked up during the series opener against England in Brisbane. The injury opens the door to Michael Neser or, more likely, Jhye Richardson, both of whom who travelled to Adelaide as part of a 14-man Australia squad for the day-night match starting on Thursday.  Hazlewood returned to Sydney on Sunday afternoon for further assessment and rehabilitation, after which Cricket Australia will make a call on his fitness ahead of the Boxing Day Test at the MCG. Australia also have concerns over the fitness of opening batter David Warner, after he took a ball to his ribs during his first-innings 94 in Brisbane. Usman Khawaja is on standby to step into the breach if needed. Leg spinner Mitchell Swepson has also been included in the squad for the match in Adelaide, where Australia will seek to open up a commanding series lead after their dominant nine-wicket victory at the Gabba.

12/13/2021,"In the final minute of the 279th Madrid derby, the fans in the south end of the Santiago Bernabéu began to belt out their version of Bad Moon Rising, the opening bar asking Atlético how they were feeling. High in the opposite corner, where just a hundred away supporters sat in silence, all too aware that they faced a long wait in the cold before they began the walk home, the answer was: pretty flat. Their team had not played badly but an early goal in either half, first from Karim Benzema then from Marco Asensio, was enough to defeat them again. Worse, they knew it was probably enough for the defence of their league title to be derailed in December.  Madrid knew that too, the embraces at the end expressing how big a step this was. Victory leaves them eight points clear of Sevilla at the top, nine above Real Betis, and 13 over Atlético and Real Sociedad. In case you are wondering, it leaves them 18 points above Barcelona, who have other problems to worry about. There is no league for them. The question is whether there is a league for anyone else; although Sevilla and Atlético have a game in hand, the answer is probably not. Fourteen days may have finished it. One by one the contenders came and one by one they fell. Sevilla, Athletic, Real Sociedad, even Inter: Madrid beat them all. Here they beat Atlético too on a night when Luka Modric’s name rang round, Thibaut Courtois made his statutory saves and Vinícius Júnior was decisive again, the most dynamic player in La Liga. The Brazilian made both. The first came early, Atlético’s bright opening over almost as soon as it had begun. Twice Koke gave the ball away and if Madrid still had a long way to go, starting by the halfway line, they also have Benzema and Vinícius who combined to carve open another opponent, a moment all it took. Asensio released the Brazilian just as Felipe doubted whether to take a step up. By the time he had decided it was too late and Vinícius almost gently lifted the cross towards Benzema – that calmness and precision a portrait of his progression. Benzema was the only man in the area in white and there were seven of them in stripes but still he found space, guiding a superb volley into the bottom corner beyond Jan Oblak. He was not fully fit and would have to make way at half-time, his work here done. Madrid were where they wanted to be, Atlético where they have been too many times recently – this was the 11th consecutive derby in which they had failed to win, and they appeared conscious of that in the remainder of the first half. Ten minutes later Koke was invited to shoot, the result offering a reason why, and for a little while not a huge amount else was happening. An Antoine Griezmann free-kick sharply saved by Courtois lacked the power to really trouble before Oblak blocked Vinícius at the near post, the attacker calling for the fans to raise the roof. From Atlético’s perspective something had to change. From Madrid’s, it did too but not through choice. Benzema, who had hurried back from injury, was withdrawn at half-time while Diego Simeone sent on João Félix and Thomas Lemar. Within five minutes they had worked an opening, Courtois stopping Félix’s shot. The Portuguese then filtered a neat pass to Mateus Cunha, dashing towards the six-yard box. This effort was more difficult to deal with but Courtois saved again, another one for the collection. Next Félix almost released Cunha with a clever volley across the pitch and then he supplied Lemar just inside the area, but a moment’s indecision was sufficient for the clear shooting opportunity that opened before him to close again. This was different, or so it seemed; instead, it proved to be the same. Atlético had started well, pushing Madrid into their own area, only to be caught once more. A long ball was laid off by Luka Jovic for Vinícius and he found Asensio to sweep into the net. There was still over half an hour to go and chances too. Mario Hermoso headed over, Luis Suárez just failed to reach from close range and Courtois twice saved from Lemar. But any real belief had drained from them with the second goal, Madrid were able to manage those moments, and Atlético increasingly sensed that they just were not going to score. And when Courtois saved a thumping, close-range Félix volley with his face in the last minute, it was done. That had hurt but he was feeling fine, thanks for asking, his fists clenched in celebration at the final whistle.",Sport/Football, Karim Benzema and Asensio fire Real Madrid to derby glory over Atlético,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/12/real-madrid-atletico-madrid-la-liga-match-report
12/13/2021,"The personal details of nearly 10,000 people seeking asylum in Australia – unlawfully posted online by the Australian government – were accessed by people in foreign countries, including China, Russia, Egypt, and Pakistan, and from masked anonymous locations. New documents show the information was allegedly used to threaten asylum seekers, and to persecute their families.  The Department of Immigration and Border Protection – now home affairs – was alerted to its massive accidental data breach by a Guardian investigation in February 2014. A compensation claim on the breach is being heard on Monday morning in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The total payout could run to tens of millions of dollars. The personal information of 9,528 people then held in immigration detention – including full names, citizenships, dates of birth, location and period in immigration detention – was publicly available online on the department’s website for eight days in early 2014. More than 2,500 of them were children. In January, the office of the Australian information commissioner ordered the Australian government to pay compensation to nearly 1,300 people from that group who mounted a class action against the government, arguing that the exposure of their information could leave them vulnerable to persecution if forced to return to their home countries. The payout model put forward by lawyers for those affected proposes at least $10,000 in compensation for each person for the impact on their privacy and human rights, with additional payments, possibly more than an additional $25,000, for people acutely affected by their private information being released. The OAIC has proposed a range from $500 to more than $20,000. Newly available tribunal documents reveal that, while most IP addresses accessing the information were Australian, there was access from at least 11 other countries, including China, Egypt, the Russian Federation, Pakistan, Malaysia, and India. It was also accessed from anonymous locations. The report, a Microsoft excel document, was directly accessed 123 times by 104 unique IP addresses. It was downloaded at least 26 times, the department says. The report was also available on the internet archive for 16 days: it is not known how many times, and from where, it was accessed there. According to submissions on behalf of the affected people, the data breach has been used against asylum seekers and, in some cases, led to their families in their home countries being threatened. In one case, a verdict in a foreign court explicitly referenced the data leaked on the Australian government website as evidence that a person linked to an asylum seeker then in Australia had helped the asylum seeker flee their home country. The person was jailed as a result. “Multiple class members [asylum seekers] have provided documentary evidence of repercussions against their families upon their protection applications becoming known, after the data breach,’’ documents before the tribunal state. “The risk of this information being accessed by authorities is now realised, and if they were to attempt to return home they would be at a high risk of being persecuted by authorities, or of having their families persecuted.” The department sent emails and letters to those people whose privacy had been breached. Not all were able to be reached. Some had left Australia, and at least 172 were not sent notices because they had died, according to the department’s records. Slater and Gordon, acting for the asylum seekers, said the loss of the personal information was especially damaging for people seeking asylum. “The immense fears flowing from the data breach are well founded,’’ the legal firm said. “The data breach is a particularly serious one, and the consequences of the breach may yet be particularly harmful.” Slater and Gordon has argued that the secretary of the department should reconsider applications for protection visas made by class members, but that were refused, in light of the data breach. “The loss of the confidential nature of the information cannot ever be rectified – on the secretary’s own evidence, it seems that there is no way to know where the information currently is or how far it has (or will) spread; there is no suggestion or sense that the sensitivity of the personal information or the potential risks posed by its disclosure will diminish materially over time (particularly in cases of class members who have left behind relatives or close friends or associates in their former countries),” the firm said. The department, in documents before the tribunal, said as soon as it was alerted to the data breach by the Guardian, it took steps to remove the document within 45 minutes. It wrote to those affected “to alert them that the inadvertent disclosure of their personal information had occurred and to express the department’s deep regret that it had inadvertently allowed potential unauthorised access to the individuals’ personal information”. In this correspondence, the department noted that it would assess any implications for the individuals as part of its normal processes, and that individuals could also raise concerns during those processes.",News/Australia news,"Asylum seekers, families allegedly threatened after Australian immigration data breach",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/13/asylum-seekers-families-allegedly-threatened-after-australian-immigration-data-breach
12/13/2021,"Labour has accused Boris Johnson of potentially misleading parliament over his knowledge of Downing Street parties, as more details came to light about a quiz he hosted in No 10 last year. The prime minister came under further pressure on Sunday when a picture emerged of him in a room with aides who wore tinsel and a Santa hat. He read quiz questions to staffers tuning in from home but also groups of officials who were elsewhere in the building, crowded around laptop screens without social distancing, and drinking alcohol. Some staff stayed on afterwards, continuing to socialise.  London was in tier 2 at the time, meaning that while working together was permitted, mixing between households for social reasons was banned, including Christmas events. Two sources who attended the event gave the Guardian details that cast doubt on Johnson’s insistence at the last prime minister’s questions that there were no Christmas parties or rules broken. The insiders said Johnson told people to enjoy themselves at the event on 15 December, and that his private office had their own quiz team. Dan Rosenfield, the prime minister’s incoming chief of staff, walked around some teams that dialled in from different rooms in No 10 to introduce himself. “It wasn’t a huge event and it wasn’t actually a risk to people,” said one attender, who pointed out that No 10 staff were being tested daily when they went into work. But they added: “I think it’s morally wrong and do feel bad about it.” Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, accused Johnson of potentially misleading MPs by denying any knowledge of rules being broken when he was asked about the Christmas parties scandal in parliament on Wednesday. She said: “It appears that Boris Johnson lied to the country and broke the law. It is increasingly clear that the prime minister presided over a culture of ignoring the rules that he told everyone else to follow. It’s time to fess up.” Bereaved family members have written to the Metropolitan police urging them to investigate the gathering and other parties in Downing Street, with Scotland Yard told to “stop turning a blind eye” to alleged rule-breaking. Jo Goodman, a co-founder of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice who lost her father, Stuart Goodman, to the virus in April 2020, said the images of Johnson at the quiz “put to the sword the notion that no rules have been broken at Downing Street last year”. She said: “It is unclear to families who have lost loved ones why evidence like this is not being utilised and that it seems no investigation is taking place by the Metropolitan police, despite numerous requests.” Jolyon Maugham QC, the founder of the Good Law Project, said the organisation planned to push ahead with a judicial review of the police if they did not open an investigation, which was “difficult but not impossible”. The picture of the prime minister hosting a quiz for Downing Street staff last Christmas “directly implicates” Johnson in an “undeniable and no longer denied” way, said Maugham. However, the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, dismissed the leaked photo, suggesting he thought it showed that the reports of parties held in No 10 in defiance of lockdown and tier restrictions were overhyped.",News/Politics,"Time to fess up over Downing Street parties, Labour tells Boris Johnson",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/12/time-to-fess-up-over-downing-street-parties-labour-tells-boris-johnson
