5/10/2022,"It was in 1986 that the dictator Ferdinand Marcos and his family were forced to leave the Philippines in disgrace. Helicopters airlifted the family from the Malacañang Palace, as protesters filled the streets. Marcos Sr, after ruling with an iron fist for 20 years, had been toppled by a popular uprising, the People Power Revolution. Crowds stormed the abandoned palace, discovering the extent of the family’s opulence. There were grand artworks, boxes of commemorative gold coins, lavish jewellery, hundreds of gowns, dresses, and, infamously, an enormous collection of designer shoes belonging to the former first lady, Imelda Marcos. Analysts say that, ever since the family was ousted, it has been intent on forging a comeback. In the documentary The Kingmaker, Imelda Marcos described it as her son’s destiny to become the president. Now he is on the cusp of doing so. Ferdinand Marcos Jr, “known as Bongbong”, was educated in the Philippines and at a boarding school in England. An extract from Marcos Sr’s diary suggests the family was concerned his son lacked the “character” needed for the future. “Bongbong is our principal worry. He is too carefree and lazy,” he writes, adding later: “I have told him that since we have enemies, he will have to fight the battles I fought in the past against myself and against circumstance.” Marcos Jr began studying politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford, but, according to the university, did not complete a degree course and was awarded a special diploma in social sciences. Marcos insists he graduated with the equivalent of a degree. After university, Marcos Jr became the vice-governor of his home province, Ilocos Norte, on the north-western tip of Luzon, at the age of 23 and later governor. He was 29 when his father was ousted and the family was forced to leave the Philippines. Marcos Sr died in exile in 1989. However, the family was allowed to return to the country in the 1990s. Marcos Jr then began to re-establish his political career, again becoming governor in Ilocos Norte, the family’s stronghold, a congressman and a senator. In 2016, he ran for vice-president but lost to Leni Robredo – an outcome he unsuccessfully challenged in court. Robredo lost to him in the 2022 presidential race. Marcos is married to the lawyer Louise Araneta-Marcos, known as Liza, with whom he has three sons. The eldest, Ferdinand Alexander Marcos III, known as Sandro, is running for the first district congressional seat of Ilocos Norte, and has developed a prominent social media presence where he is received adoringly by young female supporters. The family continues to face numerous court cases over their plundered wealth, which is estimated to be as high as $10bn. Imelda is appealing against a 2018 criminal conviction on seven corruption charges. Marcos Jr has been unapologetic about his family’s past and has downplayed or denied abuses under his father’s rule. He praised his father as a “political genius”, and his mother as the dynasty’s “supreme politician” during a recent interview with CNN Philippines. Under martial law, which was imposed by Marcos in 1972, thousands of Marcos critics were arrested, tortured and killed. Marcos Jr’s camp, and its supporters, have portrayed the Marcos years as a time when the country was thriving and prosperous. Online misinformation about the era has inundated social media, prompting media groups and academics to form factchecking initiatives. Marcos Jr’s appeal has relied on nostalgia relating to his father’s rule, say analysts. “He did not inherit the political savvy or the appeal or the charm of the father,” said Prof Maria Ela L Atienza, who teaches political science at the University of the Philippines. “He’s basically living off or campaigning on the basis of the name of the father.” His campaign, which carried the slogan “together we shall rise again”, promised unity and a return to what he has portrayed to be a former greatness. He has also pledged to prioritise jobs and lower the cost of living, including bringing down the cost of rice, though critics say such proposals are lacking in detail. His opponents fear the return of the family to power could lead to the reversal of democratic gains made in the country since his father was toppled in 1986.",News/World news,Marcos Jr aims to fulfil family’s ‘destiny’ as Philippines president,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/ferdanand-marcos-jr-bonbong-philippines-president-promises-unity
5/10/2022,"The unrelenting slaughter of Mexican journalists has continued after two more newspeople were gunned down by unidentified assassins – taking the 2022 death toll to 11 in what is the deadliest country for media professionals outside a warzone. Yesenia Mollinedo Falconi and Sheila Johana García Olivera were murdered in the town of Cosoleacaque, about 350 miles east of the capital Mexico City, around 3pm on Monday. According to reports, Mollinedo, the director of a weekly publication called El Veraz, and García, a reporter, were shot inside their Ford Ikon outside a roadside convenience store. “They have despicably and cowardly murdered a fellow reporter,” one local journalist announced in a video dispatch from the crime scene, as rifle-toting security forces surrounded the area. Mollinedo and García are only the latest in a succession of Mexican reporters to lose their lives this year in what is a growing scandal that the president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has been accused of failing to adequately address. In fact, many critics believe López Obrador, a media-bashing populist known as Amlo, is fuelling the violence with his incessant public attacks on journalists who he has labelled ill-intentioned conservative “mercenaries” bent on undermining his nationalist administration. Attacks on the press have surged 85% in the three years since Amlo took power in December 2018 with every single Mexican state witnessing such incidents for the first time in 2021. Seven journalists were killed in the whole of last year, compared to 11 in the first five months of 2022. “Every day [Amlo] urges society to discredit the journalistic profession – and clearly we are paying the price in blood,” said Sonia de Anda, a Tijuana-based journalist who recently confronted Mexico’s president over the killings. Tijuana, which sits on the US border near San Diego, has suffered most this year, with two prominent journalists murdered outside their homes there since January: the photojournalist Margarito Martínez Esquivel and the television reporter Lourdes Maldonado. The government has blamed both killings on people linked to the Arellano-Félix crime cartel – but many are skeptical. “Tijuana’s got a pretty long history of grabbing someone who may have had the gun in their hand, but not touching the person who was actually responsible,” Michael Lettieri, a San Diego-based researcher and human rights activist told the San Diego Union-Tribune this week. Speaking earlier this year, Adela Navarro Bello, the director of the Tijuana weekly Zeta, said: “Right now the Mexican press is caught in the crossfire between the threats and bullets of narco-traffickers and organized crime and the threats and verbal attacks and attempts to morally annihilate us from the federal and state governments.” “When a journalist is murdered, it’s not just the family that loses their loved one … society loses too,” added Navarro Bello, whose publication has not put a reporter’s name on an investigative story since 2006 for fear of them being shot dead. “When a journalist is murdered society becomes a little bit blinder and a little bit more deaf.” The attorney general’s office in Veraruz state, where Cosoleacaque is located, insisted Monday’s murders would not go unpunished. “All lines of inquiry will be pursued, including any connection to their journalistic activities,” it said on Twitter. However, campaigners say there is impunity in 90% of such crimes and see little sign of change. “What is happening in this country is unbelievable,” tweeted one of Mexico’s best-known journalists, Joaquín López-Dóriga.",News/World news,Two slain in Mexico are the latest in unrelenting slaughter of journalists,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/mexico-journalists-killed-slaughter-amlo
5/10/2022,"Countries should move from coal to renewable energy without shifting to gas as a “transition” fuel to save money, as high gas prices and market volatility have made the fossil fuel an expensive option, analysis has found. Natural gas has long been touted as a “transition” fuel for economies dependent on coal for their power needs, as it has lower carbon dioxide emissions than coal but requires similar centralised infrastructure, and gas-fired power stations take only a couple of years to build. Earlier this year, before Russia invaded Ukraine, the European Commission angered green campaigners by including gas as a “bridge” to clean energy in its guidebook for green investment. High prices for gas, and the plummeting cost of renewable energies such as wind and solar power, have reversed that logic, according to analysis from TransitionZero. The cost of switching from coal to renewable energy has plunged by 99% since 2010, according to its report published on Tuesday. The findings call into question the economic viability of the scores of gas and coal-fired power plants that are planned or under construction around the world. About 615GW of new gas plants, and 442GW of new coal-fired power stations, are planned for construction globally, according to the analysis. Matt Gray, the co-founder of TransitionZero, said it no longer made sense to think of gas as a transition fuel, and countries should opt for renewables in place of coal. “Despite some regional variation, our analysis shows a clear deflationary trend in the cost of switching from coal to clean electricity,” he said. “Independent of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, this trend will accelerate, presenting governments with an economic opportunity to protect electricity consumers from continued fossil fuel volatility.” Many countries are reviewing their energy policies in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has sent fossil fuel prices soaring and disrupted supplies, and may be considering a reversion to coal. The amount of power generated from coal rose 9% to a record high last year, even before the war in Ukraine, and if the coal-fired power stations now planned are built the world will have little chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C, according to separate analysis published last month. Gray said that although the economics were firmly in favour of renewable energy, governments must make some policy changes in order to realise the full benefits. These included making it easier to build windfarms and solar power, because acquiring planning permission can take up to 10 years in some regions; removing distorting incentives and tax breaks for fossil fuels; and ensuring electricity markets are properly functioning. The analysis also found that the economics of moving from coal power to renewable energy, without using gas, were most favourable in Europe, where the price of coal has increased, in part because of EU policies and also because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In China and the US, however, domestically produced coal is cheaper than in Europe. Despite the lower price of renewables, China is still planning new coal-fired power stations, and the US could increase its coal use in response to higher demand for gas. In Japan, the price of switching from coal to renewables is higher still, because of “discriminatory regulations and land-use constraints”, and in south-east Asia some countries subsidise coal and gas, distorting the economics of a switch to clean power.",News/Environment,"Avoid using gas as ‘transition’ fuel in move to clean energy, study urges",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/10/avoid-using-gas-transition-fuel-move-clean-energy-study-urges
5/10/2022,"Drivers are scrambling to buy secondhand electric cars, more than doubling sales in the past year as demand for zero-emission vehicles surges. Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) show that the number of transactions for electric cars increased from 6,600 in the first three months of 2021 to almost 14,600 in the first quarter of this year, an increase of 120%. The secondhand car industry has been buoyed over much of the past two years – despite intermittent freezes in many markets during lockdowns – as the coronavirus pandemic and semiconductor computer chip shortages have delayed the delivery of new cars, pushing buyers to opt for more readily available used cars instead. Many lightly used secondhand cars have changed hands for more than their new equivalents. The supply of used electric cars is still relatively meagre, however, and is likely to remain so for several years until first owners and commercial buyers such as rental fleets sell on their first-generation vehicles. The SMMT’s chief executive, Mike Hawes, said: “Electric car sales are energising the market, with zero-emission vehicles starting to filter through in larger numbers to consumers looking forward to driving the latest and greenest vehicles. “Although there is some way to go before we see the recent growth in new EVs replicated in the used market, a buoyant new car market will be vital to help drive fleet renewal, which is essential to the delivery of carbon savings.” Overall sales of secondhand cars rose by 5.1% year on year to 1.7 million, the SMMT said in data published on Tuesday, although they were still 12% below figures from 2019, before the pandemic. Separate data from the used-car website Auto Trader shows that average prices for all used cars on its platform rose from £13,900 in April 2020 to £17,400 in April 2022. Prices for mass-market secondhand electric vehicles rose from £18,500 to £25,800 over that period. Demand for electric cars is rising particularly fast in the UK as buyers prepare for anticipated bans or increased levies on fossil-fuel cars in several cities. The capital’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, plans to extend the city’s ultra-low emission zone to the whole of Greater London by the end of next year, and Manchester’s clean-air zone will belatedly be launched this summer. Sales of new fossil-fuel cars will be banned in the UK from 2030, and hybrids from 2035.",News/Business,UK sales of secondhand electric cars more than double in a year,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/10/uk-sales-of-secondhand-electric-cars-more-than-double-in-a-year
5/10/2022,"A baby died after maternity staff repeatedly missed chances to intervene to save his life, an official investigation has found. Giles Cooper-Hall was just 16 hours old when he died after a catalogue of errors in the maternity care of his mother, Ruth Cooper-Hall, at Derriford hospital in Plymouth. A Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) report into the incident, published on Tuesday, has exposed how inexperienced and overstretched staff failed to carry out proper checks, recognise there was an emergency or seek help from senior doctors until it was too late. It comes just weeks after the independent Ockenden report into more than 1,800 cases revealed serious failings in the maternity care provided at Shrewsbury and Telford hospital NHS Trust. HSIB’s new report highlighted how similar issues at University hospitals Plymouth NHS trust meant staff missed multiple opportunities to save Giles. It revealed how Ruth Cooper-Hall, then aged 37, was not personally seen by a consultant when she went into labour in October last year, despite recommendations made in the interim Ockenden report published in December 2020. The HSIB report also suggested Giles’ death could have been avoided if staff had known about the care plan for his mother’s labour. Instead, vital messages were not passed on, with the investigation finding this was likely to be because the staff responsible were “distracted” by other tasks. Cooper-Hall and her wife, Allison Cooper-Hall, said the investigation had highlighted “the failures in care, missed opportunities and delay in recognition of the severity and urgency of the situation”. “Our utter sadness and despair at losing Giles has been joined by anger and hurt as we now know that human error contributed to his death,” they said. “We should have come home with our baby – we will grieve for him for ever.” Ruth Cooper-Hall first alerted staff at Derriford hospital that her baby wasn’t moving as much as normal when she was 41 weeks pregnant. But she was discharged and reassured the team was “not concerned at all”. In fact, the HSIB investigation found staff had not carried out proper checks as the unit was “busy”. A senior doctor’s advice that the baby’s heartbeat should be continuously monitored was not passed on to staff on the ground. The investigation found it was likely the “multiple tasks” being carried out by the responsible clinician had acted as a “source of distraction”. Instead, the baby’s heart rate was checked only intermittently and without the recommended equipment, while new staff coming on duty repeatedly failed to check Cooper-Hall’s written records, so she was wrongly treated as a “routine” case, the investigation found. “Had the full plan of care been handed over between the clinicians caring for the mother, there may have been a different outcome for the baby,” the report said. Giles was delivered by forceps and had to be resuscitated for 20 minutes before his heartbeat was heard. But he was unable to breathe on his own, suffered blood loss and had brain damage from being starved of oxygen during labour. Later that day, his parents agreed he should begin palliative care and they were with him when he died at 8.30pm on 28 October. Ruth Cooper-Hall, now 38, added: “We had concerns at the time with the care we received in the delivery suite, including the inexperience of staff, the lack of communication, the lack of confidence and the environment of fluster and panic, but we left Derriford having been given the impression that what happened to Giles was just a tragic accident. “We thought it had all happened in the last 10 minutes of labour, but the report reveals such a larger timeframe of errors, missed opportunities and delay.” Peter Walsh, chief executive of the patient safety charity Action against Medical Accidents, said: “This is yet another tragic and avoidable loss of a baby … Too few staff and poor communication between overstretched staff. Maternity care is in a bad way and must be a top priority for more resources and improvement.” A spokesperson for University hospitals Plymouth NHS trust said: “All the safety recommendations stemming from the investigation will be fully implemented as part of our commitment to foster a culture of learning, development and improvement within the maternity setting. “Most importantly, we would like to thank the Cooper-Halls. May we again reiterate our most sincere condolences upon the sad loss of their son, Giles. The pain and distress they have experienced is immeasurable.”",News/Society,"Plymouth maternity staff missed chances to save baby’s life, report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/10/plymouth-maternity-staff-missed-chances-to-save-babys-life-report-finds
5/10/2022,"Council-maintained schools in England outperform academies in Ofsted rankings, according to analysis published on the day the government’s ambitions for all schools to join multi-academy trusts (Mats) are expected to be outlined in the Queen’s speech. Research conducted on behalf of the Local Government Association (LGA) found 92% of council-run schools were ranked outstanding or good by Ofsted in January 2022, compared with 85% of academies that have been graded since they converted. It also found only 45% of academies that were already an academy in August 2018 managed to improve standards from inadequate or requires improvement to good or outstanding, compared with 56% of council-maintained schools. The findings are part of an ongoing dispute over the impact of taking schools out of local authority control and putting them into Mats, but will have added piquancy ahead of Tuesday’s Queen’s speech, in which the schools bill will be a centrepiece legislation. The government has previously said it wants all schools in England to join or be in the process of joining a strong Mat by 2030, but many in the sector – including the National Education Union – have questioned the evidence for such a move. Currently 80% of secondary schools and 40% of primaries are academies. According to LGA research, which looked at Ofsted ratings between August 2018 and January 2022, 81% of council-maintained schools retained their outstanding rating, compared with 72% of outstanding academies that did not inherit grades from their former maintained school status. The education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, said: “Our new schools bill, alongside the schools white paper, will create a school system that works for every child, parent and family, bringing every school up to our current best standards. We want every school to be part of an academy trust, enabling teachers to focus on what they do best – meeting the needs of every child.” The bill will also strengthen the regulatory framework for academy trusts, with powers to intervene where they are failing. It will place a duty on local authorities to provide support to home schooling families, establish compulsory registers for children not in school and give Ofsted more powers to crack down on unregistered schools operating illegally. The government’s schools white paper, published in March, attempted to sweeten the pill for councils, indicating they would for the first time be able to set up their own Mats. The LGA urged the government “to build on this and utilise the knowledge and expertise of councils in supporting schools to improve”. Anntoinette Bramble, a councillor and chair of the LGA’s children and young people board, said: “While academisation can be a positive choice in some cases, these findings raise questions over whether a one-size-fits-all approach is a guaranteed way of improving results and strengthening a school’s performance.” Kevin Courtney, a joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “Today’s research once again brings into question the government’s drive to force all schools to join a multi-academy trust. The government should concentrate on the real challenges schools face – recovery from the pandemic, inadequate funding, rising class sizes, and a teacher recruitment and retention crisis – but they have no answers for them.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “The evidence quoted by the Local Government Association fails to take into account many schools will join trusts to address historic underperformance, which can take a number of years, or more than one cycle of Ofsted inspections. “Our data from over the past decade shows strong academy trusts can transform underperforming schools. More than seven out of 10 schools which became academies due to underperformance in inspections while they were local authority maintained schools now have a good or outstanding Ofsted rating. “That is why we are opening new routes for schools to join a strong academy trust, including by working with local authorities to allow them to establish trusts for the first time.”",News/Education,"Council-run schools outperform academies in England, analysis shows",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/10/council-run-schools-outperform-academies-england-analysis-shows
5/10/2022,"Priti Patel has admitted that it will take time to establish the government’s high-profile plan to send people who arrive in the UK without authorisation to Rwanda, amid growing suspicion that it will not solve the migration crisis in the Channel. In a further attack on the legal profession, the home secretary blamed “specialist lawyers” as the main reason for the delays in setting up the scheme. Under a partnership agreement, people arriving in the UK via unauthorised routes, including by crossing the Channel in small boats, will face the possibility of being flown 4,000 miles to Rwanda. Boris Johnson has said that the scheme will be up and running by the end of this month. The Home Office confirmed on Monday night that the first group of people would be informed this week of the government’s intention to relocate them to Rwanda. The first flights are expected to take place in the coming months, it said, adding that lawyers for some of those affected were likely to launch proceedings to stop their removal. Speaking during a visit to the Metropolitan police specialist training centre in Kent earlier on Monday, Patel said there were “barriers and hurdles” to overcome in implementing the scheme. Asked if it would be a long time before removals take place and whether she was confident the scheme would work, she said: “When it comes to our migration and economic development partnership with Rwanda, it is clear that our objective as a government is to remove those with no legal basis of being in the UK, to Rwanda. “I’ve said from day one, even when I signed the agreement and announced the partnership, that this will take time and it will take time for a range of reasons. “We see various hurdles and barriers, mainly from specialist law firms that want to block the removal of individuals that have no right to be in our country. That is part of the techniques that they use. “We see this day in, day out. I see this with all the removals, whether it’s foreign national offenders, people that have caused harm and criminal offences against British citizens – these firms specialise in preventing their removal. “So yes, there will be barriers and yes, it will be hurdles, but … it is a determination of this government, through the work that I have led, including the Nationality and Borders Act … that act of parliament will give us greater powers and greater means through the changes in legislation to remove those individuals who have no legal right to be in our country.” Her defence comes after the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, claimed that the £120m deal signed with Rwanda amounted to little more than a “press release” after it was disclosed that the government will have to pay for accommodation, flights and living costs for everyone sent to Rwanda. Fewer than 200 people who came to the UK without authorisation would have been sent to Rwanda last year, according to a Refugee Council analysis. Last week the prime minister was criticised for “attacks” on lawyers who are “simply doing their jobs” while the government faces legal action over the plans. Johnson claimed “liberal lawyers” would attempt to scupper the deal as Downing Street said flights for the one-way trip to the east African nation may not take place for months, in light of criticism and legal challenges. Mark Fenhalls QC, chairman of the Bar Council, said: “Attacks on men and women for simply doing their jobs are irresponsible and undermine the rule of law.” Sir Jonathan Jones QC, a former head of the government’s legal department and now a senior consultant at the law firm Linklaters, said it was “not fair to blame the lawyers for bringing such challenges – they are just serving the best interests of their clients, as they are professionally bound to do”.",News/Politics,Priti Patel blames lawyers as she admits Rwanda plan will ‘take time’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/10/priti-patel-blames-specialist-lawyers-rwanda-plan-delays
5/10/2022,"The UK’s soaring cost of living and last month’s record increase in household energy bills have slammed the brakes on consumer spending, retail sector figures show. However, according to separate data, April was the strongest month for international travel spending since before the pandemic, as Britons took advantage of the easing of Covid restrictions to book foreign holidays. Figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) show total retail sales across the UK fell by 0.3% in April as consumers tightened their belts. Spending on big-ticket items including electrical goods, furniture and homewares was particularly hard hit. Reflecting the overall slump in spending, the drop in total sales over the four weeks to 30 April compared with a three-month average growth rate of 3.2% and a 12-month rate of 6.4%. But separate data from Barclaycard showed improvements in spending on travel and international holiday bookings. The credit provider, which processes nearly half of all card transactions, said consumer spending grew 18.1% in April as airlines and travel agents had the best month since the onset of the pandemic two years ago. Spending on hotels, resorts and accommodation rose 16.6% compared with the same month in 2019, the category’s highest growth since September last year, reflecting the scramble for weekend breaks at Easter and a rush for summer holiday bookings. But Barclaycard said spending on essentials grew by marginally less than in March owing to a slight reduction in petrol usage, in a sign that Britons are seeking to save money on fuel and groceries. Highlighting the hit from higher energy bills in April, average spending on utilities per customer grew 28.8%, while Barclaycard said as many as nine in 10 people were concerned about the impact of rising household bills on their finances. According to the BRC, food sales fell 1.3% over the three months to April, compared with a 12-month average growth rate of 0.7%. While sales of clothes and footwear continued to rise, consumers curbed non-essential spending, with technology and items for the home bearing the brunt of spending cuts. The BRC said April sunshine helped to boost sales of fashion and garden goods, including outfits for special occasions such as weddings. The Bank of England has warned of mounting danger of a recession, with inflation on course to peak above 10% later this year, and Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said households were facing a difficult year ahead. “The rising cost of living has crushed consumer confidence and put the brakes on consumer spending,” she said. “Further headwinds are incoming, such as rising global food prices, which rose 13% between March and April. Retailers will continue to do all they can to mitigate the effects of these costs rises, but unfortunately they cannot absorb them all.”",News/Business,Cost of living crisis slows UK consumer spending but holiday bookings take off,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/10/cost-of-living-crisis-slows-uk-consumer-spending-but-holiday-bookings-take-off
5/10/2022,"Joe Wicks has said he realised the scale of the UK’s mental health crisis when he was inundated with messages from fans during lockdown, saying he would sometimes spend seven hours a day responding to pleas for help. The 36-year-old fitness coach, known as the Body Coach, will explore his parents’ mental health issues in a new documentary, looking at how his mother’s eating disorder and severe obsessive compulsive disorder and his father’s drug addiction affected him as a child. Joe Wicks: Facing My Childhood, was produced by documentary-maker Louis Theroux, who previously revealed Wicks’s exercise programme was one of the things that helped him cope during lockdown. Wicks told the Radio Times: “After [YouTube series] PE with Joe ended, I realised I hadn’t just helped people’s physical health, but their mental health, too. I wanted to keep that conversation going. “As a young kid, I didn’t realise my parents had mental health issues. I just thought my dad was a drug addict and my mum loved cleaning. But I was aware I had this ability to share my story, and that hopefully it would inspire people.” The fitness and nutrition specialist revealed that as a child he used exercise to de-stress and avoid the atmosphere at home. He said: “If I hadn’t exercised, I would have been a nightmare. No one would have been able to control me. PE was the one subject I looked forward to because it helped me focus.” Wicks revealed he has received little therapy himself, except a few family counselling sessions as a child, and that the documentary is the deepest he has gone into his past. Learning from his experience of being kept in the dark, Wicks hoped children could be kept more informed about their parents’ mental health. He said: “Millions of parents are experiencing mental health issues, particularly after lockdown. They’re bottling it up and trying to be brave and happy, but inside they’re probably crumbling. When the parents pull away, the children become withdrawn.” Wicks said he discovered the depth of the nation’s mental health problems after being deluged by messages from fans during lockdown. He would sometimes spend up to seven hours a day replying to the thousands of messages and pleas for help he received. “Helping people is addictive. When I open my phone and go on Instagram, I’m not just going to see a cat video. I’m going to see a DM [direct message] from someone who’s in need. That feeling of helping someone is energising, but it also drains me.

5/10/2022,"A fourth dose of a Covid vaccine can ramp up the body’s immune defences beyond the peak achieved after a third dose, research suggests. A second booster – often a fourth dose of a Covid vaccine – is currently offered in the UK to those aged 75 or over, people living in care homes for older people, and those over the age of 12 who are immunosuppressed. Now researchers say they have found a fourth dose can rescue immune responses that have waned since a third jab. “We’ve demonstrated a fourth dose of Covid-19 vaccines can produce a substantial boost to both the antibody and cellular immunity when you give them more than six months after the third dose,” said Prof Saul Faust, who led the trial and is director of the NIHR Southampton clinical research facility. Writing in the Lancet Infectious Diseases, researchers involved in the UK-based Cov-Boost trial report how they measured immune responses in 166 participants who received a fourth Covid jab on average seven months after having had a Pfizer/BioNTech jab as their third dose. All participants had initially had either two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab or two doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. Half were randomly allocated to receive a full dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid jab as their fourth vaccination, while the others were given half a dose of the Moderna jab. No serious adverse events were linked to the vaccines. The team analysed data from 133 participants, finding that 14 days after receiving the fourth jab, there was a 1.6-fold increase in antibodies among those who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, and a more than twofold increase among those who received the half-dose Moderna jab, compared with 28 days after the third dose, when antibody levels were still at their peak. Increases were seen for those over and below 70 years of age. In addition, levels of antibodies and T-cells increased substantially between the day before the fourth vaccination and 14 days after for both types of fourth jab. “Our results for immunogenicity are also consistent with the little observational evidence on vaccine effectiveness available from Israel, which indicates increased protection against symptomatic infection and severe illness from a fourth-dose booster,” the team write. Faust added that those who had little waning of their immune responses before their fourth dose gained only a limited increase in their immune responses as a result of the booster – with similar findings for others who had a recent history of a Covid infection. “That indicates there may be a ceiling, a maximum antibody level with the T-cell response effects,” he said. Faust said it was up to the UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation to decide whether a second booster should be offered more widely. Some experts have suggested in the current circumstances those yet to reach middle age might never be offered another Covid jab. But Prof Danny Altmann, an immunologist at Imperial College London, said Omicron still posed a serious threat, adding that the new study demonstrated the added value of a fourth dose. “Just because our first-generation vaccines wane rapidly and offer rather permeable protection nowadays, does not suggest we should give up and have no further boosters,” he said. “On the contrary, [given] many of us, even with high apparent antibody levels, actually show [very little] protective neutralisation of Omicron, there is all the more urgency to use [fourth] doses – in all age groups – to boost levels back up into the protective range.”",News/Society,"Fourth Covid jab can give higher immunity than initial booster, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/09/fourth-covid-jab-can-give-higher-immunity-than-initial-booster-study-finds
