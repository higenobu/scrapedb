1/12/2022,"Boris Johnson is facing increasing pressure from Conservative MPs to publicly admit if he attended a rule-breaking garden party in Downing Street. About 100 staff were invited by the PM’s principal private secretary to bring a bottle and “make the most of the lovely weather”. But Johnson has declined to say whether he attended the event. These are just some of the responses from MPs to the furore. Johnny Mercer, MP for Plymouth Moor View:  It’s humiliating, and does not reflect the majority of my colleagues who at least try and lead by example. Dr Neil Hudson, MP for Penrith and the Border: I am appalled and shocked at the reports of further gatherings in May last year that are now coming to light this week … It is vital, if we are to maintain public trust, that government employees, politicians and officials follow the same rules as the rest of the country. Christian Wakeford, MP for Bury South: How do you defend the indefensible? You can’t! It’s embarrassing and what’s worse is it further erodes trust in politics when it’s already low. We need openness, trust and honesty in our politics now more than ever and that starts from the top. Caroline Nokes, MP for Romsey and Southampton North and chair of the women and equalities select committee: I have no words that can adequately express how angry I am at the ‘don’t do as I do, do as I say’ attitude that appears to have prevailed in Downing Street. Mark Harper, MP for Forest of Dean and chair of the Covid Recovery Group: These are serious allegations. The prime minister will be in the House of Commons [on Wednesday] … and I await his explanation with interest. Douglas Ross, the leader of the Conservatives in Scotland: I’m in no doubt that any member – whether the PM or otherwise – who deliberately misleads parliament cannot continue. They would have to resign. Philip Davies, the MP for Shipley: It is clearly unacceptable for anyone in government to be flouting the laws that they had imposed on everyone else. For some of the people who imposed those damaging laws to have been ignoring them will be a bitter pill to swallow for those who faithfully followed them even at huge personal cost, and is impossible to justify and defend.” (Bradford Telegraph and Argus) Robbie Moore, MP for Keighley and Ilkley: I am deeply angered by the thought of any illegal gatherings, parties or social events which took place at Downing Street whilst the rest of the country was in lockdown and following the rules … If any event took place that was in breach of the rules, the strongest disciplinary action must be taken, and I will continue to follow any revelations on this closely.” Laura Farris, MP for Newbury, told BBC Politics live she “would have declined” any such invitation to a party: The rules were clear and unequivocal at that point in time. I don’t think anybody thought you were meant to be having parties.” Derek Thomas, MP for St Ives: If the inquiry or the Metropolitan police find that the alleged activities were illegal and that the PM knew this, or was involved, then I think he should consider his position.” Christopher Chope, MP for Christchurch: Why can’t all the dirty linen be washed at once? Why are we getting this drip, drip feed of parties?” Nigel Mills, MP for Amber Valley: I can’t see how anybody who organised a party or willingly chose to attend one can stay in any position where they’re setting Covid policy.” Bob Blackman, MP for Harrow East: Many of my constituents have sacrificed so much – not being able to visit sick or grieving relatives or attend funerals. I am clear that those who set the rules must abide by them or face the consequences.” Andrew Bridgen, MP for North West Leicestershire: If the PM has misled parliament, it’s an extremely serious matter and that, coupled with other investigations that have arisen, places the PM in an untenable situation.",News/Politics,‘Indefensible’: Tory MPs give verdicts on No 10 garden party,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/12/tory-mps-give-verdicts-on-no-10-garden-party
1/12/2022,"The Conservative party has removed the whip from Anne Marie Morris, a Devon MP, after she rebelled to back a Labour move in parliament to cut VAT on energy bills. Morris said she was disappointed by the decision, but insisted she would not apologise for supporting efforts to address the rising cost of living.  She voted on Tuesday in a favour of a Labour motion aimed at piling extra pressure on the government over the rising cost of living by challenging MPs to back up past promises on cutting VAT. The motion would have led to the government losing control of the Commons timetable to allow legislation to cut VAT to go through but was defeated by 319 votes to 229. The government had a majority of 90, with Morris being the only Tory MP to rebel. The move comes against the backdrop of rocketing energy prices, which the boss of the UK’s largest energy supplier this week said could last for as long as two years. “It is deeply disappointing to have had the whip removed by the government, especially on a matter of simply standing up for what I believed to be the best interests of my constituents,” said Morris, who has been the MP for Newton Abbot since 2010. “I believe removing VAT is the right thing to do and I won’t apologise for supporting measures that would help my hard-working constituents at a time when the cost of living is rising.” She acknowledged the government’s concern about the Opposition taking control of Commons business, but said: “I believe that any disagreement over parliamentary procedure will always come second to standing up for the best interests of my constituents.” People were struggling with their energy bills and action was needed now, added Morris. A Treasury minister told parliament on Tuesday that the government “recognises the pressure” that the public was facing on their household finances and energy bills and would “continue to look closely at all the options that exist”. Simon Clarke, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said : “No one in this government is under any illusion about the challenges families are facing with their household finances and we will of course continue to look closely at all the options that exist.” Chris O’Shea, the chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica, said on Wednesday that the energy market “suggests that high gas prices will be here for the next 18 months to two years”. It is the second time Morris has been suspended from the Conservative party. In 2010, Theresa May ordered the party’s chief whip to suspend the MP after she used the N-word at an event during a discussion about Brexit.",News/Politics,Devon MP loses Tory whip after backing Labour on energy bills,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/12/devon-mp-anne-marie-morris-loses-tory-whip-after-backing-labour-on-energy-bills
1/12/2022,"With a sense of smell up to 100,000 times more sensitive than humans’, dogs have been employed in the service of sniffing out everything from contraband to crop molds to cancer. Yet while researchers first began exploring whether canines could be effective agents in the fight against Covid-19 early in the pandemic, only in recent months have conclusive, peer-reviewed studies begun verifying the hypothesis that dogs know Covid when they smell it.  In late 2021, scientists at Florida International University published a double-blind study of canine Covid detection in which the four participating pups demonstrated a 97.5% accuracy rate in identifying biomarkers associated with Covid-19. “It’s one of the highest percentages I’ve ever seen, and I’ve been doing this work for over 25 years with all kinds of detector dogs,” says FIU’s Dr. Ken Furton, a leading scholar in forensic chemistry specializing in scent detection. “It’s really remarkable.” Another study from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found dogs could identify Covid 82%-94% of the time, whereas recent German research put their success rate at 95%. Dogs are capable of generalizing odors, meaning they can detect all currently known Covid-19 variants, similar to how they can recognize all manner of explosives when trained, explains Furton. Yet Omicron has affected search protocols used by the Ohio-based Bio-Detection K9, a company that trained dogs to identify crop diseases prior to the pandemic, and that began providing Covid detection services in October 2020 to clients including Nascar and the rock bands Metallica and Tool. “Omicron more than any other variant has changed the biology of the infection,” explains the company’s president, Jerry Johnson. Prior to Omicron, Johnson’s team of 14 dogs were trained to approach a line of people and sniff their hands or feet – where humans have many sweat glands – before sitting in front of those they considered infected. Because Omicron is expressed less through the lungs, which transfer the virus throughout the body and into our sweat, and more through the bronchial tube, people must now offer the dogs their worn mask for a sniff. Johnson’s dogs are able to screen between 200 to 300 people per hour, and require breaks every 20 minutes to maintain their enthusiasm for the job. When they work with musicians, the dogs are not screening audience members at live shows; rather, they hang out backstage, focusing on a much smaller group of talent, engineers, and entourage. “This is not a tool that you’re going to use to get 70,000 fans into the Rose Bowl,” says Johnson. “But we can be very effective if you’re trying to maintain a protective bubble.” That efficacy comes at a price; the daily rate for one of Bio-Detection K9’s teams – comprising one dog and its trainer – is $5,000. Based on his experience with detector dogs, Johnson has a theory that canines are particularly adept at finding viruses because of a biological predisposition towards identifying and avoiding disease among their ranks. The logic is that a wolf in the wild couldn’t care less about cocaine and explosives, or other things we train dogs to find, but would be naturally interested in the health of their pack. Some institutions are training their own dogs to detect Covid, such as the Freetown-Lakeville regional school district in Massachusetts, which worked with FIU to turn Labradors Huntah and Duke into school safety inspectors last summer. Dogs are not yet an FDA-approved diagnostic tool, so if they flag someone as infected, that person still must take a Covid-19 test to confirm it. However, some research indicates that dogs may be more sensitive to the virus than PCR tests, identifying infected individuals even before they have amassed sufficient viral load to register on a test.",News/World news,‘A protective bubble’: Covid-sniffing dogs help scientists – and Metallica – spot infection,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/12/a-protective-bubble-covid-sniffing-dogs-help-scientists-and-metallica-spot-infection
1/12/2022,"Christopher Hall parks his old Toyota on a dirt road that dead-ends in a forest in Oregon’s Illinois Valley. He points out a cluster of greenhouses surrounded by piles of trash, and the hillside above, which has been terraced and entirely stripped of vegetation. Guard dogs run through a small clearing, barking at us. Two men pull up almost instantly in a Honda with busted headlights; the driver asks Hall what he’s doing there. For a bespectacled middle-aged conservationist, Hall is surprisingly reckless. Even though he can see the men are armed, he yells back at them: “Where are you from? We know what you’re doing here is illegal! How many plants are you growing?” One man says they’re from Serbia and claims they have a license to grow as another truck pulls up.  I tell Hall I think we should move on, and he reluctantly shifts into drive but is unable to resist a few parting shots: “Do you think you can just keep trashing our streams? Have some respect for the land!” This part of south-western Oregon – which encompasses Josephine, Jackson and Douglas counties and was settled by goldminers in the 1850s – has always kept a touch of the wild west anti-authority streak, contributing to its status as a stronghold of illegal cannabis farms since the 1960s. Pot was legalized for recreational use in Oregon in 2015, making it legal for any person to grow up to four plants. But in the past year, longtime locals have been alarmed by the rapid proliferation of unlicensed pot farms, unprecedented in terms of size and allegedly controlled by crime syndicates from eastern Europe, China and Mexico. Hall, community liaison for the Illinois Valley Soil and Water Conservation District, has been flying over the region in a single-engine plane to map illegal pot farms and has pinpointed 1,030 clusters of greenhouses on just 20 miles of the valley, 80% of which he estimates are illegal. Local authorities agree with that estimate. These large grows have flooded the market – a pound of cannabis that was worth $3,000 in 2009 here might now fetch $400, all but killing the industry for small-time legal growers. County officials say they have been inundated by hundreds of complaints from locals who accuse “crime syndicates” of stealing their farm equipment and their water. Hall documents the impact of the illegal farms depleting aquifers by pumping from protected rivers and digging huge pits to tap into the groundwater. “It takes an act of God to get a water right in Oregon, so they just don’t bother. They just dig holes,” he says. “One of the biggest complaints this year is that people’s wells are underperforming or just drying right out,” he says. “The threat to the environmental health of the region cannot be overstated. The community is upside down.” Jackson and Douglas counties declared a state of emergency in October and asked Governor Kate Brown for state funding for more enforcement personnel because local authorities are overwhelmed. This request is not unprecedented. The national guard have participated in pot raids since 1989, when Operation Green Sweep descended on the nearby Emerald Triangle, California’s most prolific weed region, the tip of which touches southern Oregon. Those raiders saw 1,300 cannabis plants destroyed, and locals protested against that deployment of federal troops to small farms. In 2019, government raids destroyed 953,459 plants in California. It’s the same story in Oregon, where busts on large grows now yield tens of thousands of plants.“When I say cartels, I’m not talking just Hispanic,” says the Josephine county sheriff, Dave Daniel, who welcomes the idea of state and federal help. “I’m talking Bulgarian, Ukrainian, Chinese, east coast drug trafficking organizations.” Daniel, who has been sheriff since 2015, is a big man with close-cropped silver hair. “The 2021 grow season was the most brazen, in your face, wide open that I’ve seen yet,” he says. He describes farms where crews of migrant workers live under armed guard, without refrigeration or sanitation. “They rule by fear of injury and death. They human-traffic. We know that,” he says of the cartels.With a team of just three detectives, Daniel doesn’t have the manpower to properly tackle the problem. “Have you ever seen the movie Animal House?” he asks. “Kevin Bacon is in his little police or military uniform and he’s got his hands in the air and he says ‘Remain calm, all is well’ and then completely gets mowed over by the crowd? That’s me. That’s Josephine county law enforcement right there.” A big part of the problem is rooted in the legalization of industrial hemp, which looks and smells like marijuana but won’t get you high. Since 2010, it’s been legal to grow hemp in unlimited quantities. After the hemp market crashed in 2018, some farmers began hiding psychoactive cannabis plants in their hemp fields and many more leased their properties to out-of-state operators who claimed they planned on growing hemp. This ruse allows criminal organizations to grow on a vast scale. Douglas county law enforcement recently raided two supposed hemp farms they believe are operated by the same cartel and seized a total of 122,000 cannabis plants – nearly 50 times the quantity of plants that can typically be grown under a recreational cannabis license. In another Douglas county raid this November, police seized 500,000 pounds of weed, which they estimate is worth $500m. Although Governor Brown declined to send in the national guard this harvest season, which ended mid-November, Daniel hopes he will have the state’s support next year. “We’re in close contact with the governor and our federal partners are starting to open their eyes. I’ve talked to the FBI, and the DEA. And everyone is going, ‘Something’s not right in southern Oregon.’” Communities here used to be close-knit. Unlicensed pot farms abounded, but the growers were largely local people and thus had some sense of accountability to one another and the environment. Nicole Rensenbrink, a social worker who is married to the local veterinarian, has lived in Josephine county since 1983 and laments how much it has changed in recent years, describing “the endless ugliness that the huge influx of cannabis farms has brought to our valley”. She says their once-picturesque drive to work is “riddled with ugly plastic hoop houses, fencing and industrial-looking buildings,” – all the makings for large-scale pot grows. She has to keep her dogs away from the creek that runs through her property because it’s full of “nasty looking slime”; she blames fertilizer run-off from the unregulated farms. Tim Freeman, a Douglas county commissioner, says for some locals the issue goes beyond dismay over a changing landscape. “When residents call in, they are scared,” Freeman says. “They are scared about where they live, afraid of what’s going on around them and, in many cases, they are afraid to leave their homes.” Terra and Jerry Palmer live in a shingled one-room cabin that Jerry built 30 years ago. The couple were saving up to build a bigger house on their land, but are considering moving because of an illegal grow that moved in nearby last year. Terra describes constant traffic on their country road, a steady stream of “pickup trucks full of young men”, cars without license plates, and trucks full of cannabis. Hundreds of trees Jerry planted over the years have started to die off due to a lack of water.“I’m really discouraged because this year the creek went dry two months earlier than it’s ever gone dry during the all years that I’ve been here,” Jerry says. The couple have not confronted their neighbors. They fear reprisals and asked that their names be changed. Terra and Jerry may look like typical older hippies, but they come off as conventional when discussing the consequences for breaking the law on such a large scale. “Confiscate the property and jail landowners who knowingly lease land to illegal growers. Deport illegal migrant workers,” Terra wrote in a letter beseeching authorities to take action. A migrant, mostly undocumented, workforce is required to farm on the scale southern Oregon is dealing with now. Sheriff Daniel is less aggressive on the subject of those workers. “We don’t look into immigration status. State law doesn’t allow us to,” he says. “Which is fine. I treat these workers like they’re victims, to be honest with you. Which I think in large part they are.” Kathy Keesee-Morales is the program coordinator for the Unete Center for Farm Worker Advocacy, an organization that lobbies for worker rights and provides support to the migrant community. Bosses withholding pay and substandard living conditions are the most prominent issues her organization has to address in relation to cannabis farms.“There were some pretty extreme cases. There’s farms where there were young children living in what someone referred to as squalor. They were sleeping under black plastic tarps inside the hoop houses,” she says. About half of the 200 complaints of wage withholding they received in 2021 are from workers who have been abused, like the man who said when he tried to leave the farm his boss put a gun to his head and threatened his family. Large pot farms with armed bosses aren’t where most of the migrant workers planned to end up. But last year, wildfires swept through the region, immolating the nearby towns of Phoenix and Talent. This year was so dry the governor had declared a state of drought emergency by June. “So these farm workers that were depending on harvesting the orchards and the grapes to be able to survive – literally survive over the summer and save up money for the winter – they didn’t have anywhere to go except to work for these [cannabis] farms,” Morales says. The threat of violence isn’t limited to workers. “I’ve had a homeowner who leased out his property, but then he realized it wasn’t actually just a hemp grow,” says Sheriff Daniel. “He started questioning one of the soldiers – managers, soldiers, whatever you want to call it – and they threatened to burn his house down. They said, ‘We can take care of this real quick. One match. So mind your own business.’” The abuse of workers, environmental degradation and threats of violence towards locals have pushed some residents who have historically been skeptical of federal drug enforcement to ask for exactly that. Cedar Grey and his wife, Madrone, own Siskiyou Sungrown, a seven-year-old permitted cannabis farm with 5,000 plants, which is large for a legal operation. But he has been growing cannabis in this area since 1998, the year Oregon legalized marijuana for medical use. “Our local government seems to spend more time enforcing compliance on legal cannabis farms than even visiting illegal cannabis farms,” Cedar says. “That’s incredibly frustrating to legal cannabis farms. The amount of money we spend and the hoops that we jump through to be compliant with regulations – it’s mountainous, it’s unbelievable,” Cedar says. To ensure licensed cannabis farms aren’t selling on the illicit market, Oregon law requires that farmers document every scrap of plant material they grow – from seed to sale. Growers are responsible for tagging and tracking every single plant. And all work must be done on camera – even the farm’s compost piles are under surveillance. If they snip a leaf from a branch, they have to weigh the clipping and report it to the Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission, the organization that strictly monitors all legal pot farms. Grey estimates he has spent $150,000 for cameras, video, alarms and tracking systems in the last seven years. “I mean it’s really, really strange for me to be calling for a huge law enforcement or military crackdown on growing marijuana because for so long I just wanted it to be free for people to grow,” Cedar says. “But what’s happening here has to stop. It’s too bad, it’s too wrong, and it’s too damaging. I fully support federal resources being brought, Oregon national guard and federal law enforcement coming in. Hit every one of these farms.”",News/US news,‘Something’s not right in southern Oregon’: alarm at rise of illegal pot farms,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/12/oregon-marijuana-illegal-farms-environment

1/12/2022,"Despite apprehension about high Covid-19 rates, my family Christmas in Yorkshire was wonderful. Unfortunately, the week after was marred by headache, fever and malaise. And a PCR test confirmed the worst – I had Covid-19 for the second time. My second encounter has been dominated by severe fatigue and reduced concentration, which though improving, have not yet resolved more than two weeks later. Worryingly, what I know about long Covid suggests that this could persist for several months – or longer. The World Health Organization defines long Covid as ongoing symptoms “three months from the onset of Covid-19”. In December, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated that more than 1.3 million people in the UK had symptoms for four weeks or more after Covid-19, of whom 892,000 people (70%) had symptoms that persisted for at least 12 weeks, and 506,000 (40%) for at least one year. Dr Melissa Heightman, who leads the University College London hospital specialist long Covid clinic says that breathlessness, fatigue, cough, myalgia, chest pain, headache, “brain fog” and palpitations are most commonly reported. But many other symptoms may be present.  Despite this evidence, long Covid has been absent from government Covid-19 briefings over the course of the pandemic. This is a major failure, and shows the difficulty both medics and policymakers often have in identifying and dealing with chronic conditions. Throughout the pandemic, our reports, media, funding and research have concentrated on acute effects such as infections, hospitalisations and deaths, not chronic ones, such as cases and referrals for long Covid. Because of this we may not even know the scale of the problem. The ONS estimates for long Covid are based on an ongoing survey and may not be representative of the whole population. Although major research studies have been funded by the National Institute for Health Research, national and international long Covid surveillance is lacking. In each successive wave, we have sought short-term fixes for Covid-19 and long Covid. Reasons for this include short news and political cycles, chronic underfunding and under-prioritisation of prevention – all longstanding issues in UK health policy. Prevailing ways of thinking in science, healthcare and policy haven’t necessarily helped, either. For example, an outdated classification distinguishes diseases as “organic” or “functional”. Organic conditions, such as heart attacks, rheumatoid arthritis and bowel cancer are those that cause changes detectable by investigations such as blood tests or scans. Functional conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome and chronic fatigue syndrome, do not necessarily cause changes detectable by tests, or the right test may not yet be available. Stigma and misconceptions arising from this classification may lead to functional conditions being overlooked, which is surely familiar to many with long Covid. Monitoring and prevention of mortality – death – has always been prioritised above morbidity – the general suffering caused by disease. But there have been attempts to change this. A measurement called “disability-adjusted life years” (DALYs), conceived in 1990, attempts to capture the impact of diseases on people’s lives, and led to the Global Burden of Disease Study, comparing morbidity and mortality across diseases and countries. The methods that have created daily, accessible, cross-country comparisons of Covid-19 mortality need to be applied to long Covid as well. The ways we train health professionals – which are similar to when I was in medical school – still tend to focus on false binaries that silo our thinking and prevent us from seeing the whole picture. Seeing disease as “acute (immediate) v chronic” or “communicable v non-communicable” means we neglect conditions like long Covid, a chronic condition arising from an acute communicable infection. We must bring together patients, health professionals and researchers with chronic disease experience as part of pandemic preparedness and monitoring. In the UK, 90 dedicated long Covid clinics have been established, but research and data are needed to inform patient services in real time. I am leading the team conducting the Stimulate-ICP (Symptoms, trajectory, inequalities and management: understanding long Covid to address and transform existing integrated care pathways) study, which involves a trial to evaluate a community-based, comprehensive MRI scan to rule out multi-organ impairment caused by Covid-19 and digitally enhanced rehabilitation, including tailored information and recovery plans, and connection to relevant specialists through an app, which will inform future care. Another trial will repurpose existing drugs, including antihistamines (loratadine and famotidine), anticoagulants (rivaroxaban) and anti-inflammatories (colchicine) to measure effects of three months’ treatment on long Covid symptoms, mental health, return to work and other important outcomes. This is a start, but we must do more. Long Covid, like all diseases, would benefit from public health and prevention perspectives, and “integrated care” across specialties and disciplines. Siloing our thinking about disease and focusing on the short term has held us back, and patients have been left on their own for too long. Lere Fisher, a patient advocate I know through the study, told me he had “to nurse himself back to health”. Another, Lyth Hishmeh, says that patients and health professionals “continue to face difficulties knowing what to do for long Covid”. Patients originally named and recognised this new disease. It is time for our health systems to count it.

1/12/2022,"The songwriting catalogue of Marilyn Bergman, who has died aged 93, and her husband, Alan, evokes a golden age of Hollywood and popular song, and their compositions were performed by the greatest artists of their era. Their close professional relationship with Barbra Streisand is enshrined in her performance of The Way We Were. The painfully poignant ballad of remembrance and regret was a collaboration between the Bergmans and Marvin Hamlisch and won the Academy award for best original song in 1974, while their composition You Don’t Bring Me Flowers was a US chart-topping duet for Streisand and Neil Diamond in 1978. The Bergmans had already won an Oscar for The Windmills of Your Mind, a song they wrote with the composer Michel Legrand for the 1968 film The Thomas Crown Affair, and they won a third for their score of Streisand’s film Yentl (1983), another collaboration with Legrand. At the 55th Academy Awards in 1983, the Bergmans had written three of the five nominations for best original song: It Might Be You from Tootsie, If We Were In Love from Yes, Giorgio, and How Do You Keep the Music Playing? from Best Friends (though the winner was Up Where We Belong from An Officer and a Gentleman).  Streisand described the Bergmans as “like family, as well as brilliant lyricists … We met over 60 years ago backstage at a little nightclub, and never stopped loving each other and working together.” An early milestone in Hollywood was the Bergmans’ work on the 1967 film In the Heat of the Night, where they collaborated with the composer Quincy Jones. Ray Charles sang the title song, notable for its eerie and menacing lyrics: “I’m a-feelin’ motherless somehow / Stars with evil eyes stare from the sky”. When In the Heat of the Night evolved into a TV series in the late 1980s, the Bergmans and Jones resumed their collaboration on the soundtrack. Outside the movies, the Bergmans wrote a swarm of durable popular standards, including Fred Astaire’s That Face (1957), Dean Martin’s Sleep Warm (1958) and the laidback title track of Frank Sinatra’s album Nice ’n’ Easy (1960), all of these in collaboration with the composer Lew Spence. They also enjoyed a string of successes in television, writing themes for shows including Good Times, Alice and Maude. They won Emmy awards for the score of the TV movie Sybil (1976), the song Ordinary Miracles (from a Streisand concert special in 1995), and the song Ticket to Dream, composed for the American Film Institute’s 1998 TV special 100 Years ... 100 Movies. Marilyn was born in New York, in the same Brooklyn hospital where Alan had been born three years earlier. She was the daughter of Albert Katz, a Jewish garment manufacturer, and his wife, Edith (nee Arkin). She studied the piano at the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan, then attended New York University where she earned a bachelor’s degree in psychology and English. While studying music, she had often played the piano for the lyricist Bob Russell (writer of Don’t Get Around Much Any More), who urged her to become a songwriter, but she had decided she wanted to become a psychologist. However, her plans were derailed when she fell down a flight of stairs and broke both shoulders. She travelled to Los Angeles to recuperate at her parents’ home, and, unable to write or play, began writing lyrics by reading them into a tape recorder. “The first song I wrote was published and I got an advance and I thought ‘this is easy’,” she recalled. “And then it was a long time before I got another one cut.” She began writing lyrics with Spence, and it was he who introduced her to his other lyric-writing collaborator, Alan Bergman. They married in 1958, and where other songwriting duos would often suffer fractious and argumentative relationships, the Bergmans enjoyed an enviable harmoniousness. Marilyn said: “Respect, trust, all of that is necessary in a writing partnership or a business partnership or in a marriage.” She also stressed that a professional songwriter has to maintain a critical detachment from their work, considering it vital “not to have fallen so in love with what you have written that you can’t find a better way”. They also appreciated the value of hard work and research when they tackled a new project. When the director Norman Jewison recruited them to write what would become The Windmills of Your Mind for The Thomas Crown Affair, starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway, he stressed that he wanted them to evoke the anxiety McQueen’s character was experiencing as he prepared to carry out a major robbery. While Legrand composed eight very different melodies, Marilyn drew on childhood memories and her psychological training to create the lyric, with its repeating images of loops and circles. She recalled having her tonsils removed when she was seven, “and as they gave me the ether anaesthetic I remember this circular descent into a sleep state … that’s how we got the idea to write for Michel’s circular melody”. When they composed the soundtrack for Yentl, the Bergmans realised that, although they were both Jewish, they were not familiar with the traditions and practices of Orthodox Judaism. They duly sought out some rabbis and spent a year learning about Orthodox culture. Having been one of very few women in the songwriting business early in her career, Bergman was a founding member of the Hollywood women’s political committee, alongside Jane Fonda, Streisand and others. The committee raised money for Democratic political candidates, and in 1993 the Bergmans wrote material for Bill Clinton’s first presidential inauguration.

1/12/2022,"Most of the time, on the southern or eastern coast of Tasmania, you can feel how close you are to Antarctica. You feel it on the wind. Ten days by icebreaker across boilerplate seas, this is the last point of land between you and it. The gulf snaps back like elastic. Down the island’s flank, it flicks green fringes into the salt. Even when allegations of summer lie over its land, the water mutters of ice and cold. An edge to the weather. Tasmania, hunched with its head turned inward like a sleeping bird, in a futile attempt to deflect the white continent’s attention. The capital city of Hobart sits on that southern coast, the wind in its face, rushing up the mouth of the River Derwent. The artist Jon Kudelka dreamed of that channel, then painted it, so full of whales that you could walk from shore to shore on their backs. It may even once have been true.  This week Tasmania will host an Ashes Test match for the first time. “It’s big,” says the typically understated Ric Finlay. ABC Radio’s premier cricket statistician has lived on the island all his life. “Everyone knows that because I don’t think we’ve ever had days booked out before. People down here scratch their heads a bit. There’s a feeling that it’s about time.” In national terms Tasmania often feels like an afterthought. There is a whole genre of maps and art and logos that have used the shape of the mainland continent without its final piece of punctuation, and a genre of Tasmanians who delight in pillorying the omission. Within a box of Vegemite Shapes – biscuits in the outline of Australia – there are accompanying pieces of an outsized Tasmania, just in case. The feeling is justified. By far the smallest state, with a population of just over half a million, Tassie is left behind in employment numbers, health access, infrastructure, investment and just about any other measure. This is part of the reason the logging industry, which creates so few jobs in relative terms, has still been fiercely protected while destroying irreplaceable forest. It is squarely at odds with an increasing reliance on tourism, but successive state governments have done nothing. The biggest economic shift in the state has been driven by the Museum of Old and New Art, built privately by the local man David Walsh and opened in 2011, which now drives around a quarter of Tasmania’s tourism traffic. It is no surprise that Tasmania has also been left on the margins by Cricket Australia, despite being one of the six state association members that now constitute the national body. Cricket within Australia began before the nation existed, and before the colonies were states, with Victoria playing New South Wales in 1857. The Sheffield Shield between those colonies and South Australia began in 1892. Tasmania were not brought into the Shield until the 1977-78 season. Finlay saw that latter era of change. “There was a period in the mid-1980s when we went 40 matches without a win,” he says. “In 1986 there was a coup d’etat in the middle of winter, we had eight elections, one for each of the old guard against someone new.” The leader was Denis Rogers, taking over what was then the Tasmanian Cricket Association, and reform followed quickly. “When we first got a Test match in 1989, that was a huge excitement. I grew up accepting what the situation was. Given how the Tasmanian Sheffield Shield team performed, it didn’t seem realistic that we would be hosting Test matches on even a semi-regular basis. When it did happen, it made sense to me because we had changed, thanks to people like Denis Rogers. It makes sense to me given that we’re now an equal partner, we’re doing what the other states are doing.” Still, some states are more equal than others. Tasmanians routinely went two to four years between matches. National administrators cited low crowds, while scheduling matches at the start of the international season in November when the southern weather remains frigid. They allocated the lowest-drawing teams: only New Zealand, Sri Lanka and Pakistan visited until 2005, at which point the post-fall West Indies made the roster. South Africa became the fifth team in 2016, handing out a loss that resulted in half the Australian team being sacked. Whether related or not, Hobart has not hosted a match since. Australia’s administrators have done this unapologetically, making five matches the routine in home seasons. Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Melbourne, Sydney, the holy quintet. The last six-Test season was 2018-19, when India played four, Sri Lanka two, and the sixth was a debut for Canberra. Neither Canberra nor Hobart had a hope after that. Then 2019-20 was two for Pakistan, three for New Zealand. 2020-21 was one for Afghanistan, four for India. Only the postponement of the Afghan match saw it added ahead of the Ashes in 2021-22, bringing Hobart back into the frame, but the match was cancelled after the Taliban intervened. A year from now the plan is for two against West Indies, three against South Africa. Hobart’s Ashes entrée is purely an accident thanks to Western Australia’s iron border. The wholehearted response in ticket sales to a January match, when the weather can be much more kind, could be one thing to change some administrative minds. Bellerive Oval has a capacity of 20,000, so there is no reason why it should not outsell some days of Test cricket at other venues if the offer is compelling enough. But it is a Tasmanian ground, built right on the water at the Derwent’s edge, so sensible scheduling is a must. Day-night Test matches, not so much. Bellerive is part of the change that Rogers brought about. The existing first-class ground was over the western side of the Derwent, the side of central Hobart. The long, long Tasman Bridge made the eastern shore a more workable part of the city in 1965. Rogers was an easterner, and saw potential. “The TCA ground was too small, it never had the potential to be a stadium,” says Finlay. “So the decision was taken to move the headquarters of Tasmanian cricket to Bellerive. It was an ordinary club ground, they built it up from nothing. They retained the hill, it doesn’t aim to be an MCG-type arena, but it suits the city that we’re in. The culmination of all that development is what we’re about to see this week. It will be the highlight of the ground’s existence for sure. And it should make the argument that this shouldn’t be the last time.” This is an extract from the Guardian’s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

1/12/2022,"A masterpiece by the Belgian surrealist René Magritte, described as one of the most desirable works in private hands, is expected to sell for a record-breaking £45m when it goes to auction for the first time this year. Helena Newman, the chair of Sotheby’s Europe, said the “show-stopping” painting, L’empire des lumières, depicting a street at night underneath a bright blue sky, would be the star of an auction on London on 2 March.  The 114.5cm by 146cm work was painted in 1961 for Anne-Marie Gillion Crowet, a muse and close friend who had been introduced to the artist through her father, the Belgian surrealist collector Pierre Crowet. The family loaned it to the Magritte Museum in Brussels from 2009 to 2020. Should the painting’s $60m (£45m) estimate be met, it would be the highest price paid for a work by Magritte, whose most famous paintings include La trahison des images (The treachery of images) of a pipe that is not a pipe. It is already one of the highest estimates for a work of art in Europe. Crowet’s likeness is found in a number of Magritte works, and even some of those he painted before the two met. The artist told her after their first meeting when she was 16: “Tu vois, je te peignais déjà avant de te connaître” (You see, I was already painting you before I knew you). Magritte, who died in 1967, played chess with Pierre Crowet at his favourite bistro and spent evenings with him and his wife, Georgette, watching Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton movies. He had first started on L’empire des lumières in 1948, returning and enriching his vision of it over time, to leave behind 17 works, the only real attempt to create a “series” within Magritte’s oeuvre. The first version of the painting was bought by Nelson Rockefeller with others now held in the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Menil Collection in Houston and the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels. The painting on sale is the largest horizontal version that Magritte did and depicts a suburban setting thought to be a street near the Parc Josaphat in Brussels, where the artist moved in 1954. The image is said to have provided inspiration for a scene in the 1973 film The Exorcist. Before it is auctioned, the painting will be publicly exhibited in Sotheby’s galleries in Los Angeles, Hong Kong, New York and London. Newman said: “A masterpiece of 20th-century art, L’empire des lumières brings together the two most fundamental elements of daily life – those of day and night – on to one paradoxical canvas. With its impressive scale, the cinematic painting draws the viewer into Magritte’s timeless world. “Its immediacy and power encapsulate the ‘star quality’ that places Magritte firmly among the pantheon of the market’s most sought-after artists.” Crowet, who was a Belgian tennis champion in 1955, went on to marry Baron Roland Gillion, a Belgian businessman. They have donated much of their art collection to the Royal Museums of Fine Art in Belgium. Until now, the most expensive painting by Magritte is The Pleasure Principle, sold at Sotheby’s in November 2018 for $26.8m.",Arts/Art and design,Magritte masterpiece expected to sell for record £45m at auction,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/12/rene-magritte-masterpiece-record-sale-auction
1/12/2022,"With many newspaper front pages speculating that Boris Johnson’s days in Downing Street could be numbered, the minds of Conservative MPs – and those inside No 10 – will be turning to how it might all end. Here are the various ways in which Johnson could be out of a job.  Under party rules, a vote of no confidence is triggered if 15% of Conservative MPs write to Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, to formally seek one. The crucial number is now 54, after the removal of the Tory whip from Anne Marie Morris for voting against the government, which reduced the total number of the party’s MPs to 360. If a vote is triggered, a secret ballot of MPs is organised by the 1922 Committee. Should the prime minister gain the support of at least half the parliamentary party, which for Johnson would be 180 MPs, then he would remain in office, and no new no confidence vote can be triggered for at least 12 months. This was the traditional way in which Tory leaders were both quietly informed it was time to go, and the way a successor was chosen – via a closed-doors gathering of party grandees. While this is no longer the case, a Conservative prime minister can still be removed through informal pressure. Theresa May survived a no-confidence vote in December 2018, and was officially safe from challenge for 12 months. But by the next spring, with rebels attempting to change the rules to allow a new challenge, and following repeated humiliations over Brexit votes, May announced on 24 May 2019 that she would step down two weeks later. This decision was triggered by a meeting with Brady, who warned May she would face a new no-confidence vote if she did not depart soon. While May was famously dutiful, to use the slightly patronising description of some Tory opponents, and could be something of a parliamentary scrapper when needed, there is speculation that Johnson might not have the stomach for battling a no-confidence vote. If it became obvious that he had lost the support of many Tory MPs – especially if this message is conveyed plainly by Brady – then the PM might decide to simply step down, and return to an easier life in which he is free to earn considerable sums on extra-curricular work, whether as a backbencher or outside parliament altogether. A resignation triggers a leadership contest. While this took place, Johnson would be expected to stay in his post, although he could theoretically step down in place of an interim leader. This is, of course, the other option, and Johnson is nothing if not a politician who regularly defies the normal political rules. Things currently look tricky for him, but it could happen. It remains unclear how Johnson could turn things around, but one option could be a partial apology at Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions, and an admission that errors were made, with a plea for any final judgment to await the report into various alleged government parties amid lockdown being led by senior official Sue Gray. If that holds, Johnson could busy himself with efforts over Covid and the cost of living and turn to the final hope of any beleaguered politician – a vague hope that something will come up to salvage things.",News/Politics,Crunch time for Boris Johnson: how will this end for beleaguered PM?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/12/crunch-time-for-boris-johnson-how-will-this-end-for-beleaguered-pm
1/12/2022,"Mikel Arteta is adamant the best players in the world are keen to join Arsenal as they continue their pursuit of the Fiorentina striker Dusan Vlahovic. Arsenal are keen to add Vlahovic, who has 18 months left on his contract with the Serie A club and has indicated he will not sign a new deal, to their ranks in this transfer window but a deal will prove complicated. Fiorentina may be keen on maximising the player’s worth, with the asking price likely to exceed £60m, and there are question marks over his desire to join Arsenal when Champions League football is not guaranteed and they are by no means his only suitors.  Arteta, though, was bullish when asked about his club’s capacity to pull off an eye-catching signing in their current position, and said their pulling power was undiminished. “Historically this club has always been targeting the best players in the world and the best players in the world are always interested to come here and I can say that situation hasn’t changed,” he said. “Any time I have spoken to any player, they were so willing to come. I haven’t faced any other situation and that’s one of our biggest powers, our capacity to get the attention of people to come and join our club; it’s something that is a big advantage for us.” Arteta made no specific reference to Vlahovic and nor did he shed light on the potential departures of several squad players. However, Sead Kolasinac is a target for Marseille and negotiations are under way for Udinese to take Pablo Marí on loan for the rest of the season. Folarin Balogun has joined Middlesbrough on loan. Arsenal visit Liverpool in their Carabao Cup semi-final first leg on Thursday night. It was originally to be the second half of the tie, but last week’s first leg at the Emirates was postponed to 20 January after an apparent rash of Covid-19 cases in the Liverpool camp. Jürgen Klopp later said “a lot of false positives” had led to the switch and Arteta did not want to publicly question the decision. “It’s something that is not in our control,” he said. “The EFL is responsible to check every single player’s status and then make the decision whether the game is played or not. The decision was to postpone the match and I’m sure if that was the case, then they had the right arguments to do so.” Arteta’s side, who lost at Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup third round on Sunday, have Covid issues of their own and hope to discover today whether Granit Xhaka can return after a bout of the virus. Emile Smith Rowe and Takehiro Tomiyasu missed that game with injuries and four players are away at the Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. “It is extremely volatile and uncertain,” Arteta said of his players’ availability. “I don’t know what the situation is that we will have today or if it is different to yesterday. Obviously I cannot get into any detail with that. In the last week or so we lost so many players for many different reasons and we are trying to adapt to that. I will use the players that we have and make the most out of it.”",Sport/Football,Mikel Arteta insists best players in the world want to join Arsenal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/12/mikel-arteta-best-players-in-the-world-want-to-join-arsenal-vlahovic
