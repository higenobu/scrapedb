2/17/2022,"When the then Conservative cabinet minister, Norman Tebbit, fondly remembered how his dad went out on his bike to look for work he could hardly have imagined how many hundreds of thousands of people would be doing just that. The number of delivery riders working in the gig economy has boomed during the pandemic, and for some it has been a good way to earn some extra cash. Others, however, are stuck working long hours below the minimum wage and with no employment rights or benefits. Like a gigging musician playing in a pub, in the gig economy you bring your own equipment and the amount you earn depends on the number of people who show up. Today, many gig economy workers register with apps which connect them to customers requiring something or someone to be picked up or dropped off. Often, when they log into the app, they don’t know how many jobs they will get or what they will earn. They receive nothing for waiting time, no compensation if they are injured on the job, and no guidance on how work is allocated. This has led gig economy workers to demand recognition from these apps-based companies that they are employees.  When the supreme court dismissed Uber’s appeal against an employment tribunal in February 2021, it was a landmark victory for workers’ rights, taking aim at unethical practices in the gig economy which mask employment as self-employment. The ruling included requiring Uber to recognise that working time starts when their drivers log in, and ends when they log off. Since then, Uber has recognised their 70,000 UK drivers as workers, paying in-work employee benefits, setting up auto-enrolment pension schemes, and allowing them to take paid holidays. However, as I raised in the House of Commons after the supreme court judgment, the ruling only applies to drivers working at Uber (and not even to Uber Eats couriers). We urgently need legislation to create a level playing field for all, providing certainty for platforms and workers alike. Research from Fairwork at the Oxford Internet Institute has shown that other digital platforms have serious progress to make in order to deliver fair pay and work conditions. It reports that only two platforms, Pedal Me and Just Eat, could demonstrate their workers are guaranteed to get the minimum wage after costs. The EU recently proposed a new directive that would improve conditions for those working via digital platforms, establishing the criteria to be met for a platform to be judged to be exerting too much control on the worker for them to be regarded as self-employed. Importantly, platforms will also be able to give self-employed platform workers benefits without there being a risk to their self-employment status. This directive would not apply here of course, so we have an opportunity to learn from what works, or not, as other countries seek to tackle this issue too. Indeed, at the last general election, the government promised to reform employment law, building on the recommendations of the Taylor review, to both encourage flexible working but also ensure that workers have the right to request more certainty in their contracts. The forthcoming employment bill provides the perfect opportunity to show that, post-Brexit, the UK can lead on establishing clear and easy-to-use rules that work for platforms, consumers, and workers, whether they are employed or self-employed. Better working rights for the gig economy will be good for consumers too. Drivers will be less likely to hop between apps and cancel jobs when a better offer comes along if they know they have a guaranteed minimum income based on the number of hours they are available for work. It will also create a level playing field between local businesses that use their own delivery staff, as well as those that use apps. We need to ensure that bricks-and-mortar businesses that pay their taxes and treat their workers fairly are not discriminated against by a system that allows highly profitable apps to do neither.

2/17/2022,"British Gas has set up a scheme to protect the hundreds of millions of pounds it receives in advance payments from customers towards their future energy bills, after the “national scandal” that left households on the hook to pay £500m after a string of energy firms spent consumers’ deposits before going bust. The Centrica-owned energy giant has pledged to ringfence the £294m it holds in credit balances through direct debits from its 7 million customers in a bank account separate from funds it uses to run the day-to-day business.  “I think that in any other walk of life using over £500m of customers’ money to prop up a business that subsequently failed would be considered a national scandal,” said Chris O’Shea, the chief executive of Centrica. “I’m amazed it is not treated as such in the energy business.” The move makes it the first company in the sector to explicitly guarantee protection for customers in the event of future market shocks. Almost 30 energy suppliers have gone bust in the UK since gas market prices rocketed to record highs last September. The regulator Ofgem has moved customers of failed businesses to a new energy provider – a process known as the “supplier of last resort” mechanism - with customer deposits covered by the new supplier. However, the money, which Centrica has estimated from official filings is about a combined £500m, is ultimately recouped by charging every household in the UK an additional levy that is added to their energy statements. Centrica said the cost of the energy company failures, including the lost consumer deposits, was responsible for 10% of Ofgem’s near-£700 increase in the cap on average household energy bills, to £1,971. “Every single citizen in the UK will be paying for some of that half a billion and they don’t even know it – but they should,” O’Shea said. “In my view it verges on criminal. Where have all those deposits gone – offices, executive compensation, branding agreements, advertising, discounts – it has been spent on day-to-day expenses and that is unacceptable.” O’Shea called on Ofgem, which has vowed to introduce tougher new rules to make the market more resilient, to follow its lead and introduce matching industry-wide regulations as standard. “Allowing energy suppliers to take customer deposits and not making them protect those deposits was something that wasn’t thought through,” he said. “[Regulations] apply to solicitors, accountants, banks, anyone who takes a customer deposit. It is a glaring error that it hasn’t happened in energy, we don’t have the right regulation.” O’Shea warned that far from getting better, the situation relating to the scale of customer deposits was likely to get worse. Consumers overpay relative to consumption in the summer months, building up big advance deposits, which are then run down through the winter when companies spend more on energy to match usage. With consumers’ direct debit payments expected to increase substantially this spring, before another increase in the price cap by Ofgem in October, the credit balances held by energy companies are likely to increase substantially. “There are some very large suppliers lobbying against [protecting deposits],” O’Shea said. “The balance is set to get bigger and anyone who can’t do this today has already spent their customers’ money on day-to-day expenses.” Last week, Ofgem admitted that it had acted too slowly and that its regulatory agenda had been “dominated” by wanting to open the market to new entrants and promoting competition against the few big players, not protecting customers against poorly run businesses. “That’s what dominated thinking at the time,” said Jonathan Brearley, who was appointed Ofgem chief executive in February 2020, speaking to a committee of MPs last week. “It’s my view that we should have combined that with greater financial resilience.” In March last year, months before the surge in gas prices, Ofgem said it was “concerned that some suppliers may use customers’ surplus credit balances to fund otherwise unsustainable business practices”. “It is within the gift of every player in the industry to hold themselves to a higher standard,” O’Shea said. “I think we have an interest at Centrica in making sure our industry is beyond approach.”",News/Business,British Gas to protect almost £300m in customers’ cash in event of market shocks,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/17/british-gas-protect-customers-cash-market-shocks-direct-debits-credit-uk-energy
2/17/2022,"The former world darts champion Gerwyn Price is set to trade in double-tops for double-jabs after revealing he will take part in a charity boxing match in his native Wales. Price, who played professional rugby union and league before his darts career, has announced he will take on former professional Rhys “Cool, Fly and Flashy” Evans on 9 April at the Valley Tavern pub in Fleur-de-Lis, a few miles from Price’s home town of Markham.  The 36-year-old, known as “the Iceman” on the oche, revealed the news on his Instagram story and admitted he would need to lose weight for the fight. “Need to drop 10kg for this,” he wrote alongside posts about his new diet and training regime. After playing as a hooker for Neath and Cross Keys, and in league with South Wales Scorpions, Price switched to darts full-time in 2014. He is the current world No 1, and became the first Welshman to win the PDC world championship when he beat Gary Anderson 7-3 in the 2021 finals. Price reached the quarter-finals in the defence of his title and hit a nine-dart finish against Michael Smith, but went on to lose the quarter-final match 5-4. A divisive figure among darts fans, he labelled fans at the Alexandra Palace “cheats” after complaining of being distracted by a member of the crowd during the game. Evans, who hails from nearby Blackwood, boasts a 3-0 record as a super-lightweight but last fought professionally in 2014.

2/17/2022,"Like the familiar line about making music purely for yourself – and the addendum that if anyone else likes it, it’s a bonus – claiming to be entirely sui generis has long been an interview cliche. It’s a cliche recycled in the title of Melt Yourself Down’s fourth studio album, but that’s forgivable. For once, the band saying it might have a point. They’re nominally linked to London’s jazz scene: saxophonist and de facto leader Pete Wareham formerly played with BBC jazz award winners Acoustic Ladyland; Shabaka Hutchings and Tom Skinner have passed through their ranks en route to the justly acclaimed Sons of Kemet. It’s hard not to feel that the current vibrancy of said scene and the high profile of artists such as Hutchings and Nubya Garcia might account for Melt Yourself Down’s major-label deal: there’s something fairly improbable about a band named after an obscure track by the confrontational no wave saxophonist James Chance sharing a roster with Ronan Keating, Alfie Boe and Michael Ball and amiable Aussie bar band the Teskey Brothers; furthermore, a band whose main concession to commerciality has involved their Mauritian vocalist Kushal Gaya shifting to singing in English, rather than a hybrid of French, Creole and a language of his own creation.  For all their pedigree, Melt Yourself Down don’t really deal in jazz. It’s certainly in their DNA. Although the sax on Pray for Me frequently feels as though it’s filling the space occupied in rock by rhythm guitar by churning out monumental riffs, there’s no mistaking the lineage of the sharply pointed interjections on Sunset Flip, or the atonal solo-in-miniature that erupts during Balance. In reality, they’ve spent 10 years attempting to carve out a space in uncharted territory bordered by punk, Afrobeat, funk and traditional Egyptian and Sudanese music. It’s a bold and fascinating idea. So bold, in fact, that their previous music sometimes made you wonder if was possible to put into practice. It feels wrong to criticise a band for being too eclectic, but there was something ungainly and jarring about the way 2020’s 100% Yes jumped from style to style: one minute its fusion of hammering drums and honking sax recalled X-Ray Spex, the next it was chucking out rhythms inspired by two-step garage or techno. There were exciting moments, but also a sense of fusion that didn’t quite fuse. That’s a problem that Melt Yourself Down seem to have fixed. Pray for Me charges purposefully at the listener. Even the ballads, if you can apply that term to the slower-paced All We Have and Ghost on the Run, are focused by metallic synths and ominous, time-stretched noise. It sounds purposeful not merely because of its intensity – everything is distorted, as if the recording equipment can’t cope with the volume at which the band are playing – but because its myriad influences have coalesced into a coherent, broiling sound that carries through the stylistic leaps on display. Boots of Leather starts out with a slippery Afrobeat rhythm. Midway through, handclaps arrive, shifting its emphasis: it suddenly sounds like a glam-y stomp. It shouldn’t work, but, held together by growling bass and massed vocals, it does, to thrilling effect. For all their sonic ferocity, the songs on Pray for Me have strong melodies and hooks in abundance. It’s music that feels entirely of the moment, and not merely because the lyrics frequently deal in what-next? confusion: “My best friend said I’m not Black enough / My neighbour said I’m not woke enough,” the title track complains, while on All We Have, the question “Can we cope?” hangs in the air unanswered. The music is writhing and funky – the band’s two drummer/percussionists even manage to inject a certain dancefloor swing into the Neu!-inspired rhythm of Sunset Flip, an impressive feat – but its power isn’t euphoric or hypnotic so much as cathartic. Pray for Me frequently feels as though something pent up being released. Of the moment or not, there’s an unmistakable note of uncertainty and pleading in the album’s title. You can understand it: the American writer Ted Gioia recently caused consternation with an angry Substack bemoaning the dominance of algorithms (“anything that genuinely breaks the mould is excluded from consideration almost as a rule”) and claiming “nothing is less interesting to music executives than a completely radical new kind of music”. While you hesitate to apply quite such a feverish term to the contents of Pray for Me, they’re certainly different. You wonder if it will find the audience it should in a climate predicated on labelling, on gathering music together in themed playlists. Fingers crossed.

2/17/2022,"Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, has called on the UK government to impose a wealth tax on the super-rich to help tackle “spiralling inequality”, which he said was “deeply damaging to our collective morale and trust”. Williams, who was the most senior bishop in the Church of England from 2002 to 2012, on Thursday joined a growing group of moral leaders demanding a one-off tax on the richest 1% of the population to help close the “staggering” gap between the richest and poorest in society.  “Spiraling inequality is a major issue in our society, and all the evidence suggests this is deeply damaging to our collective morale and trust,” Williams said. “A wealth tax of the kind we are backing recognises that vastly disproportionate rewards for a very small number of citizens will not make for a cohesive and just national community.” Williams told the super-rich they should not view paying back to wider society as a tax burden but as “an opportunity to build a stable, sustainable economy that works for everyone”. Government figures show the richest 1% of households in the UK each have at least £3.6m. At the other end of the scale, the poorest 10% of households have £15,400 or less, with almost half burdened with more debts than they have in assets, according to data published by the Office for National Statistics last month. It means the gap between rich and poor had widened to the largest in more than a decade even before the Covid pandemic struck. Williams joined other leaders in the Church Action for Tax Justice campaign group demanding that the government take urgent action to combat inequality by introducing an initial one-off wealth tax on the richest 1% of the UK population, and commit to reviewing the tax regime with the intention of introducing ongoing wealth taxes. A wealth tax on the top 1% could generate at least £70bn a year, according to research by Greenwich University. That would be equivalent to 8% of the current total tax take but would affect only about 250,000 households. The Wealth Tax Commission, set up in 2020 to consider the costs and benefits of imposing a wealth tax, recommended a one-off 1% tax on households with more than £1m. It said the tax would generate £260bn – more than enough to cover a year’s funding of the NHS and social care spending. Cat Jenkins, a manager at Church Action for Tax Justice, said: “As Christians, we believe we are called to highlight injustices in our society and to speak and act for change. The system, as it currently stands, unfairly favours the wealthy over those less well off. In times as hard as these, it’s even more crucial – and morally right – that the richest among us contribute a good measure towards the common good.” The campaign group, which works with churches and Christians of various denominations, said: “It’s time that the wealthiest in our country were asked to pay a good measure of tax, rather than asking the less wealthy to contribute ever greater proportions of their income to the common good.” A group of more than 100 members of the super-rich have repeatedly called on governments around the world to impose higher taxes on them. The Patriotic Millionaires movement, including the Disney heiress Abigail Disney, said the tax system was rigged in their favour and needed to be rewritten to make taxation fairer and restore trust in politics. “As millionaires, we know the current tax system is not fair,” they said in an open letter. “Most of us can say that while the world has gone through an immense amount of suffering in the last two years, we have actually seen our wealth rise during the pandemic – yet few if any of us can honestly say that we pay our fair share in taxes.” Such taxes are being introduced in Argentina, Bolivia and Morocco to help pay for the pandemic recovery. In Norway, about 500,000 people pay an 0.85% charge on their assets above the value of about £125,000.

2/17/2022,"This exotic MGM romance directed by Hepburn’s then husband, Mel Ferrer, was in fact her first big flop. Anthony Perkins plays a Venezuelan refugee whose life is saved by Rima the jungle girl: Hepburn in a suede pixie tunic, accessorised with a pet fawn and backed by a supporting cast in brownface.  Hepburn was by now really too mature for this sort of ingenue role; in a trashy Sidney Sheldon adaptation, she inherits a pharmaceutical empire and finds herself menaced all over Europe. Not as much fun as it sounds, but compensations include an all-star cast of suspects and an Ennio Morricone score. Hepburn got top billing for the last time in Peter Bogdanovich’s lightweight indie-style romcom. There’s an hour of Ben Gazzara following her around the streets of New York before we even hear her speak, and the film was scuttled by the murder of poor Dorothy Stratten, one of Hepburn’s co-stars. A Texas rancher’s daughter is revealed to be a Kiowa, leading to friction between her adoptive family, local bigots and the tribe demanding her return. Hepburn is basically miscast as a Native American in John Huston’s dour western; even worse, she broke her back in a serious riding accident during production. Hepburn, in dazzling white cable-knit, literally represents heaven in Steven Spielberg’s remake of A Guy Named Joe, a movie guaranteed to make you blub. The star’s final film appearance was little more than a cameo, but what a cameo! Bonus points for donating her entire $1m salary to Unicef. Well-meaning but dated melodrama adapted from Lillian Hellman’s play These Three, about two schoolteachers (played by Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine) whose lives are ruined when a pupil spreads a rumour that they’re lesbians. “The reason I chose Audrey is that she is so clean and wholesome,” said the director, William Wyler. “I don’t want bosoms in this.” Hepburn plays the cello-playing daughter of a private detective who charms a millionaire playboy in Billy Wilder’s elegant, Lubitsch-like romcom set in Paris. But the 27-year age gap between the leads, exacerbated by Gary Cooper already showing signs of his terminal illness, proved discomfiting even for contemporary viewers. Julie Andrews fans were furious when Broadway’s original Eliza Doolittle was snubbed by the film’s producers, but Hepburn is a charming cockney guttersnipe and looks fabulous in Cecil Beaton’s costumes. Her songs had to be dubbed, though co-star Rex Harrison was allowed to sprechstimme his way through the musical numbers. King Vidor’s literary epic, filmed in Italy, may not be the best adaptation of Tolstoy’s novel, but it has a fine Nino Rota score and beautiful cinematography by Jack Cardiff. The script is clunky and the acting is a mish-mash of clashing styles, but Hepburn gives a luminous star performance as Natasha. Hepburn is enchanting as the chauffeur’s daughter in love with the son of her dad’s employers. Humphrey Bogart plays the brother who tries to scupper that match by wooing her for himself, but the 29-year age gap between them means Wilder’s romantic comedy seems a bit icky in hindsight. Truman Capote envisaged Marilyn Monroe as the heroine of his novella, but the bowdlerised film role went to Hepburn, whom Photoplay had called “altogether un-Marilyn Monroeish”. Mickey Rooney’s Japanese caricature is a shocker, and I’ll never forgive Holly for dumping her cat in the rain, but Hepburn is an icon of timeless chic in her little black Givenchy dress. Hepburn plays a typist hired to help a screenwriter (William Holden) meet his deadline in a deconstruction of movie cliches that was panned on its release. George Axelrod, the Charlie Kaufman of his day, wrote the screenplay, which is packed with in-jokes, genre riffs and superstar cameos, and Hepburn is surprisingly funny and sexy as a comic femme fatale. What fun to see Hepburn hiding in a cupboard with an age-appropriate leading man at last. Peter O’Toole plays the debonair burglar she enlists to help her steal a fake Cellini statuette. Wyler’s cute Paris-set caper doesn’t reach the heights of Charade, on which it’s clearly modelled, but it’s worth seeing for Audrey’s ultra-mod Givenchy outfits and charlady disguise. Hepburn’s best performances are the ones where she doesn’t appear to be acting, but the acme of her self-consciously “serious” work is the title role in Fred Zinnemann’s film about a Belgian nun whose faith is variously tested by nursing in the Congo, Peter Finch as a handsome but agnostic doctor, and the Nazi occupation of Belgium. Hepburn plays a blind woman in this tense thriller that never quite transcends its stage origins. Alan Arkin hams it up as the villain trying to get his hands on a heroin-stuffed doll in her possession by dressing in wacky disguises. In a turn up for the books, Hepburn is seven years older than Albert Finney, the actor cast as her husband here. She swaps Givenchy for groovy Carnaby Street gear in Stanley Donen’s astute relationship drama, cleverly scripted by Frederic Raphael, about an unhappily married couple driving south through France, with flashbacks showing the pair making the same journey in happier times. “She was absolutely enchanting, and we said ‘That’s the girl!’,” said Wyler about picking Hepburn for the role that won her a best actress Oscar and propelled her to stardom. Princess Ann is so fed up with official duties she goes awol in Rome with American journalist Gregory Peck (only 13 years Hepburn’s senior), rides a Vespa and gets a gamine haircut. A meeting of middle-aged movie legends; Hepburn is virtually the same age as Sean Connery, her love interest in Richard Lester’s bittersweet Robin Hood coda. Maid Marian is now an abbess, still miffed that Robin ditched her to go gallivanting off to the Crusades. Everyone is older but not necessarily wiser in this wry, elegiac romance with a heartbreaking denouement. Hepburn plays a bluestocking bookseller who gets a chic makeover (though she looks perfectly chic to begin with) in Donen’s delightful musical. Fred Astaire, 30 years older than his leading lady, though still nimble on his pins, plays the Avedon-esque photographer who whisks her off to Paris for a fashion shoot. And the music is great: Think Pink! Bonjour Paris! Basal metabolism! It’s the best Hitchcock film that Hitchcock never made: Donen’s impeccable romantic thriller stars Givenchy-clad Hepburn at her most adorable, with Cary Grant (25 years her senior, but hey, it’s Cary Grant!) as the suave mystery man who saves her from MacGuffin-hunting thugs. No one flees for their life quite as prettily as Audrey, and Paris has never looked lovelier.",Arts/Film,Audrey Hepburn’s 20 greatest films – ranked!,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/17/audrey-hepburn-20-greatest-films-ranked
2/17/2022,"Everything I am, I owe to calories, as Sophia Loren never quite said. I have built myself, one edible unit of energy at a time. In truth I have more than built myself. I am over-engineered, in the way Mussolini’s Milan railway station is over-engineered, or Jason Momoa is over-engineered. See how deftly I compare myself to Momoa? We are exactly the same, him and me. Save that every calorie he consumes turns into a plank of rippling muscle, while mine turn into the greatest muffin top this side of the Greggs cake counter. But it’s all flesh, right? Ah, calories. Mostly I try to ignore them; to regard them as I do the isobars on a meteorologist’s map which in no way describe the experience of standing outside in a howling gale. I know that not all calories are equal; that calories from carbs impact the body differently to those obtained from protein, for example. I also know that we all process foods differently. I have a metabolism that suggests I may at some point have been gene-spliced with a sloth, and hence spend hours in the gym brutalising myself. I also like my dinner very much. I regard the diet book industry as a massive scam. If a single diet book worked there would be no need to publish another one ever again. But still they come.  All of this means I should regard the introduction in April of mandatory calorie counts on the menus offered by all hospitality businesses with 250 employees or more as worthy of nothing more than a theatrical shrug. I don’t think of it that way. I find the prospect extremely dispiriting. Eating out is meant to be an indulgence, even when it isn’t a splendid parade of chips, gravy and custard-drenched puddings. It’s meant to be a pleasure. And it is very hard to indulge yourself in pleasure when the metrics arising from your behaviour are being thrown in your face all the time. It’s a bit like going to an orgy only to find it’s being patrolled by an army of nurses armed with swabs and petri dishes. I imagine. Which, of course, is the whole point of the new legislation. Obesity costs the UK £6.1bn a year, rising to £9.7bn by 2050. We clearly need to do something about it. The question is whether this new legislation will help. The evidence that calorie counts on menus change behaviour is scant. One recent US study found that calorie consumption falls initially, before gently rising back to previous levels. It does, however, have other impacts. In 2012 major high street brands including KFC, Costa Coffee and Pizza Hut, representing 9,500 outlets, signed up to a voluntary initiative led by Public Health England to introduce calorie counts. That led in turn to major activity behind the scenes. The companies that supply cakes to the big high street coffee shops are now constantly being told to reduce the calorie counts on new products and to revise existing ones. The great likelihood is that all the restaurants newly landed on planet calorie count will be doing something similar. Alternatively, they’ll take advantage of one exclusion in the legislation: “specials”, those dishes on the menu for 30 days or less, do not need to be calorie counted. So expect to see a huge expansion in temporary items or small adjustments to existing dishes every 29 days to make them suddenly new and – whaddya know? – exempt. And expect to read about me ordering loads of them. It will be an act of self-delusion, but I am more than capable of that. jay.rayner@observer.co.uk",Lifestyle/Food,Eating out is an indulgence – so is putting calorie counts on menus doomed to fail?,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/17/eating-out-is-an-indulgence-so-is-putting-calorie-counts-on-menus-doomed-to-fail
2/17/2022,"Sarah Smith, the BBC’s former Scotland editor, has said she feels relieved to have left the country after enduring years of misogynistic “bile and hatred” while covering Scottish politics. Smith, the recently appointed North America editor for BBC News, said she repeatedly experienced gendered abuse while doing her job, which led her to significantly reduce her use of Twitter and to fear she had become a visible target.  Born and educated in Edinburgh, she said she believed much of the abuse came from nationalists because her father was John Smith, the UK Labour party leader who died in 1994. He was a notable critic of Scottish independence. In remarks published by the Reuters Institute, Smith said: “He was a very well known politician, he was a unionist, people like to therefore assume that my politics must be the same as my father’s, despite me being, one, a different person, and him having been dead for 27 years.” People would “roll their car windows down as they drive past me in the street to ask me ‘what fucking lies you’re going to be telling on TV tonight, you fucking lying bitch’,” she told Rhys Evans, a BBC Wales executive. That “vitriolic attention” occurred routinely while she prepared for live broadcasts in public. Smith said she “pretty much stopped tweeting” because she feared attracting “shit I can live without”. An experienced reporter for the BBC, 5 News and Channel 4 News, including a stint as US business correspondent, Smith was appointed as the corporation’s first Scotland editor in 2016, in the wake of the 2014 independence referendum. She also anchored current affairs programmes, including Sunday Politics. Named as the BBC’s North America editor in November last year, succeeding Jon Sopel, Smith told Evans she was relieved to be leaving Scotland. In the US she would be “gloriously anonymous”. “Nobody will have any idea who my father is. So the misogynistic idea that I can’t have any of my own thoughts anyway, or rise above my family connections to report impartially, will no longer be part of the discourse.” Attacks on Smith escalated after she suggested during a live 10 O’Clock News broadcast in May 2020 that Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, “enjoyed” being able to distinguish herself in combating the Covid pandemic. Sturgeon furiously denied that on Twitter, and said she found the Covid crisis stressful and unpleasant; Smith said her choice of words was a mistake. She also wrongly reported that Alex Salmond had called on Sturgeon to resign over the mishandling of an official sexual misconduct investigation against him, and retracted that on Twitter. Evans said Peter Smith, ITV News’s Scotland correspondent, and Ciaran Jenkins, who covers Scotland for Channel 4 News, were also regularly abused on social media for alleged bias, which appeared at times to be coordinated. “Absolutely horrendous” abuse came from unionists, Peter Smith said, but the majority was from independence supporters. There have been a series of incidents in which BBC journalists have been abused or attacked. Three men were charged after Nick Watt, Newsnight’s political editor, was chased in the street by anti-lockdown protesters in June 2021.

Finland overpowered Switzerland 4-0 late on Wednesday to claim their fourth women’s ice hockey bronze medal. Team GB’s women curlers advanced to the semi-finals by a narrow squeak. Three teams tied at five wins and four losses each, so it went down to the draw-shot challenge to determine who went through - an average of the accuracy of each team’s last-stone draw in every match. By that measure, Great Britain prevailed. The semi-finals are tomorrow. Switzerland face Japan and GB face Sweden, while Canada missed out. Miho Takagi of Japan had picked up three silver medals so far in this Games, but in the 1,000m speed skating today she finally has her gold, and a new Olympic record. Brittany Bowe of the US played a major role in Erin Jackson becoming the first Black woman to win an individual Winter Olympic gold earlier in these Games, and Bowe now has her own bronze. Jutta Leerdam of the Netherlands took silver. Things you might have missed If I ever get to time-travel back to before these Games I will be sure to bet a fortune on both the USA and Canada getting knocked out of the men’s ice hockey at the quarter-final stage on the same day. Friday’s semi-final lineup will be Finland v Slovakia and the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) v Sweden. It is the first Olympic semi-finals without the US and Canada since 2006. South Korea’s Choi Min-jeong retained her short track speed skating 1,500m title on Wednesday as Arianna Fontana of Italy bagged a record-breaking 11th career Olympic medal with a silver. Fontana’s ongoing dispute with her national skating federation doesn’t seem to have eased, and she is still unlikely to compete in her home Games in Milano Cortina in 2026. “The season after Pyeongchang, I had male athletes targeting me on the ice, so it was not safe for me to stay with the team,” Fontana has said previously. She currently lives and trains in Hungary. The International Testing Agency says Ukraine’s cross-country skier Valnetyna Kaminska has tested positive for doping with a steroid and a banned stimulant. It is the second doping sample taken at Beijing to test positive. The first involved Alpine skier Hossein Saveh Shemshaki of Iran.

She then proceeded to drop the F-bomb on camera while talking to the race officials, and I couldn’t honestly find it in my heart to blame her. In murky conditions at Zhangjiakou the final result was Sweden’s Sandra Naeslund with gold, Canada’s Marielle Thompson in second, and Daniela Maier of Germany promoted up to bronze at Smith’s expense.

2/17/2022,"When you try to describe the much-loved video game Lemmings, it sounds like a wind-up. Your mission: herding a collection of tiny, green-haired, blue-jumpered, bipedal sprites from a trapdoor entrance to a safe exit without them dying horribly. It looked, if not bad, then wilfully basic even for 1991. But, released years before mobile phone games were a thing, it was nonetheless a fiendishly addictive game that feels like the spiritual precursor to the likes of Angry Birds. And it was manna to many, many kids like me, whose sole household computing device was a rubbish PC with a horrible four-colour CGA screen that basically couldn’t play any video game of the time … except Lemmings! To mark 30 years since its release, Exient – current holders of the franchise – has made a YouTube documentary about it. Made remotely, Lemmings: Can You Dig It? largely consists of interviews with the people involved in the creation of the original game, plus spirited nostalgic interjections from various nerdy talking heads.  Accepting its limits, it’s pretty damn endearing. The story begins in ’80s Dundee, which we discover had a remarkably vibrant coding scene thanks to the local Timex factory, which manufactured ZX Spectrums, many of which found their way into the local population. A trio of kids – Russell Kay, Mike Dailly and David Jones – met at the city’s Kingsway Amateur Computer Club, and would go on to make games together, eventually landing themselves a deal with Psygnosis, a hip Liverpool studio that was home to priapic beat ’em up games. Lemmings was the exact opposite of this and was initially rejected, but eventually Psygnosis came around. Most of the documentary consists of accounts of what a delightful time the trio and various other pals had making it. The game started out as an experiment in how many individual animated sprites could be made to walk across a screen at any one time, and took on a sort of giddy momentum that would eventually beget million of sales: by the time they recount how they designed the actual levels, the whole thing sounds like a dream job. Viewers of the documentary will doubtless learn something new: something that I missed at the time was that the game had a carefully crafted 20-level two-player mode that almost nobody knew about, and was basically impossible to access without advanced soldering skills. One of the more fun elements explored here is that the game had never involved any concept art whatsoever: the sprites clearly do not look like actual lemmings, and were merely given the name because of their idiot behaviour. Hence, for hazy reasons, artist Adrian Powell – whose previous job was painting murals in old people’s homes – was drafted in, something he still sounds bemused about to this day. He was essentially responsible for “interpreting” the featureless sprites into something with an adorably rodentlike form … things might have turned out very differently had his art been less cute. The film probably doesn’t need to last for two hours: that’s one minute longer than Citizen Kane. There are moments when it could do with a less rambling structure, for the developer talk to be toned down (“Of course, nobody has ever credited DPaint with gaming on the Amiga,” opines renowned designer Peter Molyneux, bafflingly.) or for somebody to ask some slightly less earnest questions, ie did Lemmings make them all massively rich, and what did they do with said riches? When it ends, it does so with an obligatory 15-minute plug for the game’s current mobile phone iteration that everyone seems a bit sheepish about, and fans of Lemmings 2, Lemmings 3D et al may be dismayed that there’s no mention of any of the interim games. But really this is all about the original, and despite some rambling over-explanations and evident budget limitations, there’s a sweet, earnestness to this documentary. The tale of three lads from Dundee taking on the world via the medium of stupid walking rodent people will make you pine for a simpler age.",Arts/Television & radio,‘The sprites clearly do not look like actual lemmings’: the inside story of an iconic video game,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/17/the-sprites-clearly-do-not-look-like-actual-lemmings-the-inside-story-of-an-iconic-video-game
