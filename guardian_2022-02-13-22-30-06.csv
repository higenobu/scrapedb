2/13/2022,"If you want proof that the process known as nuclear fusion can produce energy at scale somewhere in the universe, you need only look at the night sky: each pinprick of light is a natural nuclear fusion-powered reactor. For decades, scientists have sought to bring the power source of stars down to Earth and, in a stunning result recently announced, the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy in Oxfordshire has reached a new landmark in sparking and sustaining a mini star. Scientists working on a doughnut-shaped machine called Jet, or the Joint European Torus, were able to double the previous world record (set in 1997) for energy released by fusion reactions. While the experiment ran, the output of fusion power was equivalent to four onshore wind turbines – a step towards power production at an industrial scale.  In keeping with Jet’s design and objectives, less fusion power was generated than was needed to heat the fuel. In fact, no experiment has yet yielded more energy from fusion than has been used to kick off the reactions – this remains an outstanding goal of fusion scientists around the world. What the latest results provide is a compelling indication that bigger and better star machines that work similarly to Jet, such as the internationally funded Iter project now under construction in France, will be able to produce more power than they consume. Also important is that although this experiment only ran for five seconds, the reactions stopped not because of a disruption within the fuel, as has previously been typical, but because supporting equipment got too hot. Cryogenic cooling systems will prevent this on the next generation of machines, so the leap from five seconds to five minutes, or five hours, or even longer, now seems feasible. Why should the rest of society care whether these scientists can recreate star power? Fusion energy has the potential to provide clean power on a planetary scale. If it can be perfected, there’s enough fuel for everyone on Earth to use as much energy annually as the average American for at least thousands of years, and probably millions. This form of power doesn’t produce carbon dioxide or long-lived radioactive waste, and there’s no chance of the meltdowns like those at Chernobyl and Fukushima. Today, energy is in short supply, is the leading cause of the climate crisis, and is being used as a dangerous geopolitical chess piece. You may well wonder why fusion energy hasn’t yet been cracked. Reproducing conditions similar to those found in stars, where fusion thrives, is a terrifying technological challenge – perhaps humanity’s greatest ever. Fusion machines must reach temperatures between four and 10 times hotter than the sun’s core. On Jet, a web of invisible magnetic fields 80,000 times stronger than the Earth’s is needed to control and confine the fuel. The fuel itself is a swirling mass of charged particles that is susceptible to instabilities that can halt the reactions in milliseconds. But fusion scientists are on a roll. In August 2021, a US experiment came excruciatingly close to smashing fusion’s most anticipated goal of producing more energy than was put in. Although the total energy was modest at just a 60th of Jet’s new record, the US facility beat its own previous record, set in 2018, 23 times over. In December, China’s Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (East) controlled matter at 150m degrees centigrade for 1,000 seconds, albeit without the special types of hydrogen fuel that will eventually be needed on commercial reactors. Meanwhile, there is a burgeoning private fusion industry: in the last three months of 2021, the total investment more than doubled to $4.2bn. To close out a stellar six months, Culham’s experiment has shown the world that sustained high power output from fusion reactions is possible. Despite the momentum, there’s some way to go before fusion powers your house. Even the most flush private fusion firm is only promising a pilot plant by 2025, and the current plans for publicly funded laboratories won’t see star power on the grid for three decades. We will need fission and renewables at immense scale much, much sooner to combat the climate crisis. Even so, it’s time to get excited about star power. Technology and research have always been the key to growing human wealth and prosperity. If fusion energy can be successfully rolled out, it will be a landmark in human history akin to the adoption of electricity or the invention of powered flight. Because our need for clean energy is acute, the sooner it does come, the better. But it will still be immensely useful regardless of when it arrives. And, as with any technology, progress doesn’t come with the passage of the years but with investment and societal will. With both, fusion could arrive sooner than we expect. Whatever the precise timeline, the advances of the past six months – and even the past week – suggest that star power has a very bright future ahead.

2/13/2022,"Like so much else, the momentum built up by Big Thief’s two excellent 2019 albums was halted by the pandemic. They began work on their fifth album almost two years ago, but – with lockdowns and three of the band releasing solo material (with mixed results) – it’s been a lengthy gestation. In part, though, that was because they chose to record its 20 songs in four sessions, each in a very different location (upstate New York; Topanga Canyon, California; the Colorado Rockies; Tucson, Arizona), each with a different engineer. The result is their most varied and expansive record to date. With the running order hopping between the four sessions, there’s the feel of a carefully curated mixtape to proceedings, stark balladry rubbing shoulders with raucous hoedowns (from the Tucson sessions, thanks to the addition of Mat Davidson‘s fiddle) and bucolic country rock. As with all the best records, there are fresh highlights with every listen: the intimate Change, as affecting as Orange from their third album UFOF; the infectious Spud Infinity transcends the awfulness of its title to cut its metaphysical lyrics with references to garlic bread and potato knish; the loose, distorted groove of Little Things; Love Love Love’s meandering guitar parts that could have come from a Crazy Horse record – the list goes on and on. Wonderful.

2/13/2022,"For the visitor, the Hayward Gallery’s extraordinary new exhibition of the late work of the French-American artist Louise Bourgeois is a major undertaking. Thanks both to its size – the show gathers together some 90 collages, sculptures and installations, many of which have never been shown here before – and to the ever-confounding spaces of the gallery itself, inside it takes a little while to get oriented. The eyes must adjust to the Hayward’s permanent dusk; the body must fight a powerful sense of expectation. You want both to rush around in a frenzy and to commune with everything for minutes at a time. In the end, I did two circuits, one fast and one slow, and even then I wasn’t satisfied. Enfolded in the dark pleats of Bourgeois’s mind, the longest glance still seems somehow to be cursory. Here is a series of caverns, each one of which demands to be fully explored. What’s strange about this spirit of investigation is that Bourgeois’s practice would appear to work against it. Delicate though she may sometimes be, nuance is more or less unknown to her. This is art that’s easy to read, the messages it semaphores close to trite at moments (this may be one reason why the exhibition’s curator, Hayward director Ralph Rugoff, has kept his own interpretations to a minimum). What else could Femme Maison (2001), in which a fabric house has been stitched to a female torso, be about but the burdens of women? What more can be said of Do Not Abandon Me (1999), a piece that comprises the figure of a naked woman and her newborn baby, once you’ve finished speculating to which of them – mother or child – the fear suggested by its title most applies?  And yet this lack of ambiguity impedes our curiosity and excitement not one iota. Why? I think it has to do, sometimes, with her media. Even if we’re not allowed to touch it, looking at Bourgeois’s art is a haptic experience: her textures are almost as thrilling as her feeling for narrative drama (for melodrama, sometimes). Mostly, though, it’s connected to a certain lurid intimacy. As Robert Hughes said, her work has a “queer, troglodytic quality, like something pale under a log”. Ugh! you think. And then: but just let me take another look. The Woven Child focuses exclusively on the last two decades of the artist’s long career, an astonishing burst of late life creativity in fabric and textiles that was born, in part, of memories of her childhood (she died in 2010, aged 98). We know that her growing up was traumatic – she came to regard her father’s affair with her teenage governess as a form of child abuse – but this fiery flurry isn’t only to do with psychological pain. Bourgeois’s parents were tapestry restorers, and in old age she returned to her roots, incorporating needles, bobbins, embroidery and weaving into her art. If everyday objects are here transformed into miniature horror shows – in Untitled (1996), cow bones are used for coat hangers; in Untitled (2010), pale woollen berets become swollen, severed breasts – what’s displayed is also intensely domestic. Her totemic “progressions”, which revisit her vertical, segmented “personages” of the 1950s, are now made from materials such as bed linen and tapestry work (the latter bring to mind church kneelers). Eugénie Grandet (2009), a series of 16 panels that uses the handkerchiefs and tea towels from the trousseau she brought with her when she moved to the US seven decades before, is (to me, at least) a kind of update of the samplers girls sewed in the 19th century, practising their stitches. (This piece is named, of course, for Balzac’s heroine, a character with whom Bourgeois identified on the grounds that her father, too, was oppressive.) How to pick out things for special attention in a show in which almost everything is fascinating, horrifying, strange, eerie, beautiful? The first object the eye sees is Cell VII (1998), one of Bourgeois’s enclosures: installations in which personal objects – in this case, a scale model of her childhood home in Choisy-le-Roi, and clothes that belonged both to her and her mother – may be spied as if through a keyhole. The peeping tom effect induced by such storytelling – a feeling of transgression on your part which, paradoxically, only brings you closer to the artist – is not, I should say, unusual. Moving on, I almost blushed at High Heels (1998), a kneeling figure angled carefully to expose both her buttocks and the soles of her impossible shoes. The curator describes The Reticent Child (2003), in which a series of soft pink figures – they represent the birth and early life of the artist’s youngest son, Alain – appear contorted in the concave mirror behind them, as a “diorama”, and in a literal sense, this is correct. Really, though, it’s so much more private – and dynamic – than the word suggests: a flickering home movie as shot by Dr Freud. Is there a spider? (A favourite motif of Bourgeois, arachnids, those super-weavers, stand for mothers in her world.) Yes, there are several, the biggest of which, Spider (1997), is in the upstairs gallery. This huge steel monster straddles a mesh “cell”, inside which are more of the artist’s belongings, among them a bottle of Bourgeois’s favourite scent, Shalimar. “The spider is a repairer,” she said, and perhaps this sense of restoration – a tapestry-covered chair is also inside the cage – is one reason why this piece induces a creeping sense of contentment as you circle it. More likely, though, it’s simply the result of its triumphant size. Bourgeois was doing what she did long before feminism finally made her fashionable; it wasn’t until the retrospective of her work at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1982 that she began to come out of the shadows as an artist. Nevertheless, it is inspiriting, at this point in the 21st century, to be able to claim her as one of our own; as a warrior who both embraces and disdains the domestic realm, who reads it as both haven and battlefield. The Shalimar, in particular, made me smile. Those heady woody-smoky-vanilla notes floating, in my imagination, in the air around all that metal! Somehow, this encapsulates Bourgeois for me. The female experience is her dominion, and it does not diminish her one bit to say so. But this realm must not merely be seen. It must be sensed, deeply, from within.

2/13/2022,"From Ryūsuke Hamaguchi, a director who is already figuring prominently in awards nominations with Drive My Car, comes another delicately humane story of chance connections and unexpected emotional links. Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy premiered in Berlin last year, winning the Silver Bear, but was somewhat overshadowed by the ambition and scope of the Cannes prize-winning Drive My Car, which debuted a few months later. But this female-led triptych of stories, with its deft, empathetic camerawork and intimate, intricately crafted character sketches, is a minor masterpiece in its own right. Unapologetically dialogue-heavy, each segment is given levity by a certain playfulness of approach. The first story, about a young woman who realises that her best friend’s new boyfriend is her own ex, concludes with a teasing dual ending. The second – the darkest – deals with an attempted honeytrap seduction with a terrific extended scene powered by a sparky erotic charge. And the final segment takes a gentle sci-fi premise – a devastating computer virus – but relegates it to the background in favour of a story of mistaken identities between two women.  The unexpected warmth and embrace of this final story makes it the most beguiling, but all three are tantalising glimpses executed by a film-maker who brings the precision of the very best short story writing to his cinema.",Arts/Film,Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy review – a minor masterpiece from Japanese rising star,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/13/wheel-of-fortune-and-fantasy-ryusuke-hamaguchi-review-a-minor-masterpiece
