3/15/2022,"Good morning. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has given Joe Biden a second chance to demonstrate the steady leadership he promised, raising hopes among Democrats that the White House’s efforts to punish Moscow for its shocking aggression will resonate with voters in this year’s midterm elections. As the war in Ukraine threatens to push already rising gas prices even higher, Democrats are blaming “Putin’s tax hike”. At the same time, they are touting the administration’s role coordinating a worldwide response to Russia, and the devastating impact of economic sanctions, highlighting a contrast with the former president Donald Trump, who has continued to praise Putin. This strategy comes with considerable risk, however. Foreign policy is rarely front of mind for voters. The situation remains volatile and unpredictable. Should Democrats be hopeful? Recent surveys have shown an increase in support for Biden, buoyed by approval of his handling of the conflict in Ukraine, though his overall ratings are still mired in the low 40s. Do Americans support the administration’s response to the conflict? Broadly they say support the response. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, Americans overwhelmingly favor a ban on oil and gas purchases from Russia, even if it means paying more at the pump. Pre-dawn explosions have been heard in Kyiv this morning, as Russia and Ukraine were due to meet again for talks aimed at ending the 20-day war. A series of Russian strikes hit a residential neighbourhood in the capital today, igniting a huge fire and prompting a frantic rescue effort in a 15-storey apartment building. At least one person was killed and others remain trapped inside. Shockwaves from an explosion also damaged the entry to a metro station that has been used as a bomb shelter. City authorities tweeted an image of the blown-out facade, saying trains would no longer stop at the station. Talks between Russia and Ukraine were due to resume today the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, adding that the previous round had gone “pretty well”. Is China going to send economic aid to Russia? US officials fear China has already decided to provide Russia with economic and financial support and is contemplating sending military supplies such as armed drones. What’s happening to the Russian oligarchs? Spain has temporarily seized a $140m superyacht in Barcelona that belongs to Sergei Chemezov, a former KGB officer. Meanwhile, four protestors who occupied the home of Oleg Deripaska have been arrested by police. What else is happening? Here’s everything we know on day 20 of the Russian invasion. A detainee at a secret CIA detention site in Afghanistan was used as a living prop to teach trainee interrogators, who lined up to take turns at knocking his head against a plywood wall, leaving him with brain damage, according to a US government report. The details of the torture of Ammar al-Baluchi are in a 2008 report by the CIA’s inspector general, newly declassified as part of a court filing by his lawyers aimed at getting him an independent medical examination. Baluchi, a 44-year-old Kuwaiti, is one of five defendants before a military tribunal on Guantánamo Bay charged with participation in the 9/11 plot, but the case has been in pre-trial hearings for 10 years, mired in a dispute over legal admissibility of testimony obtained after torture. What does the report say? It says interrogators at the site, known both as Cobalt and the Salt Pit, went beyond the CIA’s guidelines in torturing Baluchi, using two techniques without approval. Is he really brain damaged? A neuropsychologist carried out an MRI of Baluchi’s head in late 2018 and found abnormalities affecting memory formation and retrieval as well as behavioral regulation which were “consistent with traumatic brain injury”. The Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has praised the employee on Russia’s state Channel One television who launched an extraordinary protest against Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Marina Ovsyannikova burst on to the set of the live broadcast on Monday evening, shouting: “Stop the war”. A Democratic fundraising organization is filing a complaint to the Federal Election Commission in which it accuses Trump of violating campaign finance laws by spending political funds for a 2024 presidential bid. A year to the month after the Ever Given blocked the Suez canal for a week – prompting global fascination and countless memes – the container ship’s cousin has run aground in the Chesapeake Bay. Officials are now scrambling to refloat that container ship, ironically named the Ever Forward, after it got stuck. Jane Campion, the Oscar-nominated, multi-award-winning director of The Power of the Dog, apologized yesterday for telling the tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams they “do not play against the guys like I have to”, during an acceptance speech at the Critics Choice awards on Sunday. Kali, a Swiss teenager is trying to paralyse the digital presence of the Russian government and the Belarusian railway. He one of about 300,000 people who have signed up to a group on the chat app Telegram called “IT Army of Ukraine”, through which participants are assigned tasks designed to take the fight to Putin. In so doing, they are trying to level the playing field between one of the world’s superpowers and Ukraine as it faces bombardment and invasion. Faced with rising gasoline prices, many Americans are considering switching to an electric car. But Senator Joe Manchin, who holds key swing vote in US Senate, has poured scorn on the idea of phasing out gasoline and diesel cars. Manchin, who has taken more money in political donations from fossil fuel interests than any other senator, also said he had “a hard time understanding” why the federal government would invest in a network of electric car charging stations, as Biden intended to do. Pete Davidson is heading to space. The Saturday Night Live star is among the six passengers on the next launch of Jeff Bezos’ space travel venture Blue Origin, the company announced yesterday. The launch is scheduled for 23 March and Davidson will be the third celebrity on a Blue Origin flight, which give passengers a few minutes of weightlessness above the Earth’s surface before the capsule parachutes and lands in the west Texas desert.

3/15/2022,"Looting of emergency food supplies and attacks on aid workers are rising in South Sudan, where hunger is causing unrest. A security vacuum is fuelling the violence as communities take up arms to fend for themselves amid unprecedented food shortages, aid agencies have warned. The UN has said 70% of the country’s population will struggle through the coming lean season. There is concern among aid agencies that the regularity of attacks is a symptom of the widespread unrest prompted by a lack of government services and insecurity, rather than coordinated action by organised militias. Two humanitarian workers were killed in separate incidents in February in the Abyei region and neighbouring Unity state in the north of the country, and there have been numerous attacks this year on aid convoys, warehouses and medical teams. The Norwegian Refugee Council said its warehouses were looted four times in February in Unity state, depriving about 23,000 people affected by flooding of crucial aid. The attacks led aid workers to leave, meaning the agency had to suspend some operations. A World Food Programme (WFP) warehouse in Leer, Unity state, which has become a focal point for people displaced by fighting in the region, has also been looted. Almost 40,000 people had arrived in the town in Unity state by the end of February due to fighting nearby. Last week a convoy of WFP trucks delivering food was ambushed in Jonglei state. “There is a proliferation of criminality and an increase in a lack of security, and attacks on aid happens within that context,” said Annette Hearns, deputy head of the UN’s office for humanitarian affairs. “The proliferation of guns, limited access to livelihoods, and the gap between those who have and those who do not further drives violence.” Hearns said the government must protect civilians and secure roads to allow crucial aid to reach those in need. “Ultimately, it’s the most vulnerable of the most vulnerable who suffer most,” she said. An estimated 8.9 million people in South Sudan are in need of humanitarian aid, including 680,000 people affected by floods since May 2021. Agencies are organising the delivery of supplies to flood-prone states such as Jonglei before the rainy season starts, to ensure they reach areas that have been cut off in recent years. The UN said at least 130 humanitarian workers, mostly from South Sudan, have been killed in the country since 2013. Five died during 370 violent attacks recorded last year. Médecins Sans Frontières said a health team was robbed at gunpoint and two of their vehicles were burned in the Yei district of Central Equatoria state this month, forcing them to temporarily halt operations. Two years after South Sudan’s two leading factions agreed to form a unity government after years of fighting, the circulation of weapons has continued. September’s UN report on the proliferation of small arms in South Sudan found the uncontrolled flow of weapons had contributed to tension, including between farmers and herders competing for shrinking resources. Between June and September last year, at least 440 people were killed and 64 subjected to sexual violence in Tambura county in the country’s Western Equatoria state, it said. Recently, the UN reported 50,000 people were displaced by fighting in Abyei, on the border with Sudan, “allegedly driven by longstanding territorial disputes, inter-tribal tensions and revenge seeking”. Abraham Diing Akoi, a South Sudanese researcher, said the absence of government intervention was forcing communities to fend for themselves, including by arming their youth. “When the government cannot provide you basic things like schools, healthcare and medicine, people understand that the government is not functional,” he said. “You have to survive so you get [what you need] for yourself. That can include looting humanitarian supplies or going to another community to take cattle.” Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN mission in South Sudan, told the UN security council this week: “The dire economic situation and its impact on youth has resulted in a surge in criminality and xenophobic hostility towards humanitarians and peacekeepers.” Marwa Awad, with the WFP in South Sudan, said three years of flooding had worsened food scarcity. “People are losing their livelihoods, cattle, homes, land and crops. So imagine you are struggling to survive or build a stable future because of conflict, displacement and high food prices, then the floods come to finish you off. Sadly, people here do not get a moment’s rest,” she said.",News/Global development,Looting and attacks on aid workers rise as hunger adds to unrest in South Sudan,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/15/south-sudan-hunger-aid-workers-attacks-looting
3/15/2022,"Christian Eriksen was called up to the Denmark squad on Tuesday, the first time he has been selected since he suffered a cardiac arrest at the European Championship last year. Kasper Hjulmand included the midfielder in the 23-man squad that will play the Netherlands and Serbia in friendlies this month. Eriksen, 30, signed for Brentford in January as a free agent for the rest of the season after Internazionale terminated his contract because of Serie A rules. Eriksen was fitted with a special heart-starting device known as an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD), which is not permitted in Italy’s top flight. Denmark have qualified for the World Cup in Qatar which starts in November. Eriksen said in January that it was “a goal, a dream” to play in the tournament.",Sport/Football,Christian Eriksen gets first Denmark call-up since cardiac arrest at Euro 2020,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/15/christian-eriksen-first-denmark-call-up-squad-since-cardiac-arrest
3/15/2022,"In a world where malicious thoughts and dark memories can morph into fearsome monsters that wreak havoc on society, the future of the human species is bleak. Such is the premise of this prequel to the hugely popular manga and anime series Jujutsu Kaisen, which follows eccentric sorcerers vowing to protect humanity against these deadly curses. Bloody, action-packed and tragicomic all at once, this dazzling coming-of-age tale masterfully contemplates the knotty process of coming to terms with past traumas through a horror-fantasy lens. The beautiful Tokyo Jujutsu high school, where young sorcerers are trained in the art of exorcism, is once again the central setting. The timid Yuta has just enrolled as a student, and, haunted by his love for his late childhood friend Rika, he is dogged by her spirit, which has taken the form of a monstrous worm-like creature that attacks anyone who wishes him harm. In learning how to harness this energy/curse, Yuta encounters many familiar faces from the series: among them his dashing and goofy mentor Satoru Gojo and the taciturn Toge Inumaki who only communicates in riceball ingredients, since his words have the power to kill. Just as Yuta slowly loses his shyness and sharpens his magical abilities, he and his new friends come face to face with the powerful trickster Suguru Geto, an ex-Jujutsu student with an evil plan to extinguish all non-sorcerers from the Earth. The gorgeous animation is at full throttle during this adrenaline-pumping showdown between good and evil, as a web of painstakingly detailed monsters of all kinds spring into gory action. Bolstered by an electrifying score, this cathartic ode to the triumph of love is a treat for ardent fans and newcomers alike.  Jujutsu Kaisen 0 is released on 18 March in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Jujutsu Kaisen 0 review – sorcerer anime series gets a spectacular prequel ,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/15/jujutsu-kaisen-0-review-sorcerer-anime-series-gets-a-spectacular-prequel
3/15/2022,"Is that a look of delight or terror in the eyes of the cast when Ricky Tomlinson takes to the stage? He is the big draw in this patchwork show (I hesitate to use the word play), in which the regulars at a pub called Irish Annie’s take turns to interrupt a jolly set of singalong favourites by the band on stage. Tomlinson is nominally a character called Scouse Pete, but is actually just Tomlinson. Dressed like Jim Royle in The Royle Family, mustard T-shirt, slip-ons and lank grey hair, the 82-year-old is in full-on anecdote mode. As we are in St Helens, he gives us the one about local boy Johnny Vegas needing a massage on the set of Grimsby. As writer Andy Lynch is in the house, he recalls his Brookside breakthrough as Bobby Grant. And as he is Ricky Tomlinson, he reminds us of his run-ins with Cilla Black, his meeting with Norman Wisdom and his imprisonment after a 1972 strike. The overturning of his conviction in 2021 gets a cheer. He could go on with this stuff forever, which seems to alarm singer and director Asa Murphy, watching from stage left. He knows it’s time for Tomlinson to do the pub quiz and urges him to get on with the show. The quiz turns out to be a series of Christmas-cracker jokes enlivened by Tomlinson throwing sweets into the audience as prizes. It’s feeble stuff, but thanks to Tomlinson’s generous bark of a laugh, the exertions of host Catherine Rice, who has more enthusiasm than script, and spirited renditions of The Wild Rover, Brown Eyed Girl and Danny Boy, they just about get away with it.
