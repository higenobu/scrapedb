5/20/2022,"Civil servants and special advisers have reacted with fury and disbelief after Scotland Yard confirmed Boris Johnson got only one of 126 fines levied for law-breaking parties at the heart of Downing Street and Whitehall. The Metropolitan police came under intense pressure to explain how it reached its conclusions after Downing Street said officers confirmed no further action would be taken against the prime minister despite him attending gatherings for which others were fined. The Met’s fourth-month investigation, costing £460,000, has now concluded, paving the way for the publication of a full report by the senior civil servant Sue Gray next week. Her preliminary report found “failures of leadership and judgment by different parts of No 10 and the Cabinet Office”. A former Met chief warned the force was open to claims it had bungled the investigation unless it took steps to explain itself. Brian Paddick, now a Liberal Democrat peer, said: “The Met has no defence to the accusation that it gave the prime minister one fixed-penalty notice (FPN) as that was the minimum he could be fined, but did not do so for other events for political reasons,” he said. “The decision not to explain is a mistake. It was a mistake not to investigate in the first place. They said there was no need to investigate and then they issued 126 fines, which is not good for their credibility.” The 126 fines were issued to 83 people – 35 men and 48 women – with at least one person receiving five FPNs, the Met said. The fines, typically £50, covered events held on eight separate dates. Officials who were among those fined were struggling to understand how Johnson could have escaped further censure. He, his wife, Carrie, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, received one fine each for celebrating the prime minister’s birthday in June 2020 when indoor gatherings, except for work purposes, were banned. One Whitehall source pointed out that junior civil servants had received FPNs for going to at least one event which the prime minister not only attended but also gave a speech at. Another said: “It’s the twentysomethings I feel sorry for – who went to events that were their seniors’ leaving bashes and things.” A former No 10 staffer insisted that during the Covid pandemic it was usual for Johnson to wander over to officials sharing a drink and praise them for “letting off steam”. One official warned that another source of resentment was the fact that evidence presented in good faith to Gray by junior officials was then handed to police, while more senior figures declined to cooperate. “Some people worry that they ended up being penalised because, before the police were even involved, they tried to help with the report, when others who stood back maybe got away with it.” There is widespread anger at the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, who was described by one Whitehall insider as a “submarine” who had offered no leadership or counsel throughout the crisis: “People trusted their bosses and they got fined, you’d think someone might acknowledge that at some stage.” Some officials believe Case should have shouldered part of the blame for the culture that developed in No 10 during lockdowns – and as the most senior civil servant, should have spoken up for junior staffers caught up in the inquiry. Mike Clancy, general secretary of the Prospect union which represents civil servants, said: “The scale of these breaches of the law is clearly symptomatic of a deeply damaged culture at the heart of Downing Street. Ministers in this government are far too quick to blame officials when it is they who are responsible for taking the lead when it comes to setting that culture.” Civil servants were contacted on Wednesday by a cabinet official liaising with the Met, who acknowledged it was a “challenging time” and warned that a “small number” of the 126 fines remain to be issued in the coming days. Johnson is not expected to give his own response to the completion of the Met’s investigation until next week, when Gray publishes her full report. Officials say it remains possible the final report could include photographs used as evidence but that these are unlikely to be of parties in progress, or show individuals. A decision also had yet to be made on naming any individuals involved, although if this happened, it would only be for people at senior grades. A source said the report, which is being updated before being sent to lawyers, would be sober in tone: “I don’t think there will be any salacious details not heard before. It will be quite dry, but it will set out the facts, and people can assess those as they choose.” Conservative backbenchers who previously called for Johnson’s removal say next week will be a moment of truth for colleagues who have withheld judgment about his fate. “If Gray’s report is published next week, they’re going to run out of road, and they’re going to have to make a decision.” Meanwhile the Met will face further questions about its handling of the investigation, said Len Duvall, leader of the Labour group on the London assembly. “I think the police and crime committee will want to ask questions and understand how the Met have reached their conclusions about the prime minister only getting one fine,” he said. “I think from the information in the public domain, he [Johnson] has got away lightly. It is for the police to justify why there was just one fine.” The Met’s acting deputy commissioner, Helen Ball, said the fines were issued for “clear cut” breaches after detectives scoured more than 500 photos plus emails, CCTV, and door logs to see who was where and when. “Our view is that these 126 referrals are clear cut. We made sure after a really thorough investigation that clear evidence existed of a breach,” she said.",News/UK news,Civil servants and No 10 advisers furious over single fine for Boris Johnson,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/19/civil-servants-and-no-10-advisers-furious-over-single-fine-for-boris-johnson
5/20/2022,"Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal were handed their worst scenario in the French Open draw on Thursday after Nadal was drawn into Djokovic’s top quarter. As a result, the pair could face each other in the last eight. The extremely unbalanced top half of the men’s draw is further complicated by the presence of the other favourite, the 19-year-old supernova Carlos Alcaraz, who defeated Nadal and Djokovic in consecutive matches to win the Madrid Open this month. He is projected to face Alexander Zverev, the third seed, in the quarter-finals, meaning Djokovic or Nadal could face Alcaraz or Zverev in the semi-finals. Great Britain’s Cameron Norrie, the 10th seed, will face the French wildcard Manuel Guinard in the first round and could meet Alcaraz in the fourth round. Djokovic, the top seed and defending champion, will start his tournament against Japan’s Yoshihito Nishioka. Nadal, who opens against Jordan Thompson of Australia, had been ranked inside the top four until a week ago when he lost in the last 16 of the Italian Open to Denis Shapovalov after suffering a flare-up of his chronic foot injury. His defeat allowed Stefanos Tsitsipas, who lost the Rome final against Djokovic, to leapfrog him ias fourth seed, opening the door for Nadal, seeded fifth, to possibly be drawn in Djokovic’s quarter. After resting his foot in the days since Rome, Nadal has had multiple training sessions in recent days and he has been mobile throughout. The bottom half of the men’s draw is headlined by Daniil Medvedev, the second seed, Tsitsipas and Andrey Rublev. Dan Evans, the 29th seed, has drawn Francisco Cerundolo in round one. In the women’s draw, Iga Swiatek begins as the heaviest French Open favourite since the last years of Serena Williams’ dominance. Swiatek, the 2020 champion, arrives in Paris with a 28-match winning streak and will face a qualifier in the opening round. A potential fourth-round match against Simona Halep or Jelena Ostapenko, both former champions, looms in the distance. Emma Raducanu, seeded 12th for her French Open debut, has been handed a decent draw as she looks to shake off her recent back injury. She will open her tournament against a qualifier and, should she win that, would then face either Aliaksandra Sasnovich or Xinyu Wang. The former No 1 Angelique Kerber, who is least comfortable on clay, is the highest seed in her section. The most notable first round match of either draw is undoubtedly that between the unseeded Naomi Osaka and Amanda Anisimova, the 27th seed. Anisimova, a former prodigy who reached the 2019 French Open semi-final aged 17, defeated Osaka in the third round of the Australian Open this year. Osaka, meanwhile, arrives in Paris nursing an achilles injury that forced her to retire in Rome.",Sport/Sport,Novak Djokovic could play Rafael Nadal in French Open quarter-final classic,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/19/novak-djokovic-could-play-rafael-nadal-in-french-open-quarter-final-classic
5/20/2022,"The MP Claudia Webbe, who was found to have harassed a woman because she was jealous of her relationship with her partner, has begun her attempt to overturn her conviction. Webbe, 57, the independent MP for Leicester East, was handed a 10-week jail term, suspended for two years, at Westminster magistrates court in November after she was found guilty of harassing Michelle Merritt. Webbe is appealing against her conviction and sentence, at a hearing in front of Judge Deborah Taylor and two magistrates at Southwark crown court. Opening the case on Thursday, Susannah Stevens, prosecuting, said the reason for the harassment was Merritt’s friendship with Webbe’s boyfriend, Lester Thomas. The court heard that the campaign began with silent phone calls in September 2018, then “escalated” on 31 March, Mother’s Day, the following year, when Webbe questioned why Merritt was in touch with her boyfriend. “This appeared to be her obsession,” said Stevens. “The fact Ms Merritt should not be seeing or having contact with Lester Thomas.” Merritt said Webbe started calling her names: “She called me a slag and a slut. [She said] ‘Stay away from Mr Thomas’ and ‘You’re a slag and you should be acid.’ “She said she knew where I lived and [asked] why was I sending pictures of my tits and pussy to Lester. [She said] ‘I’m going to send them to your daughters.’” Merritt said she felt “horrible”, adding: “I certainly didn’t want to be harmed in any way. I was very frightened and shaking.” She said she called police and told them: “I have been threatened by a public figure with acid.” The court heard that Merritt received 17 further phone calls lasting 14 seconds or less from Webbe after the MP was warned by police to stop contacting her. In a phone call recorded by Merritt on 25 April 2020, Webbe was heard saying: “I have seen all of your naked pictures.” In the recording, Webbe said: “Get out of my relationship, otherwise I will tell your whole family and show them all of your pictures.” Stevens said: “It was this jealousy that caused her to threaten Ms Merritt and to say deeply distressing things to her.” Webbe entered the Commons as a Labour MP in December 2019, winning the seat formerly held by Keith Vaz, the Labour veteran who retired from parliament in the wake of a scandal. Labour has previously said the party will push for a recall petition to force a byelection if Webbe does not step down but will have to wait until the outcome of her appeal. The appeal will continue next week.",News/UK news,MP Claudia Webbe’s appeal hearing over harassment conviction opens,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/19/appeal-hearing-mp-claudia-webbe
5/20/2022,"The “real living wage” is set by the Living Wage Foundation (LWF) and is £9.90 across the UK and £11.05 in London. It is independently calculated based on what people need to get by and is currently paid by more than 10,000 businesses. The organisation runs an accreditation scheme where businesses are committed to paying all staff and those in their network the living wage. Here we look at some of the big players in retail that have received accreditation for paying the living wage, and some that have not. Burberry The fashion powerhouse was accredited by the LWF in April 2015. The luxury British brand is listed on the London Stock Exchange and has more than 9,000 employees worldwide. Its chief executive, Jonathan Akeroyd, took the helm last October after being the boss at rival fashion house Versace since 2016. He had also held jobs at Alexander McQueen and Harrods. Akeroyd was given a £6m “golden hello” for leaving his previous position, with a deal to be paid a base salary of £1.1m, with a maximum annual bonus worth up to 200% of his base, and a share plan worth 162.5% of annual salary. Ikea The flatpack Scandinavian furniture retailer was accredited by the LWF in March 2016. The Sweden-based company was founded in 1943 and rapidly expanded to have stores in 30 countries and 225,000 employees. The company was praised by the retail trade union Usdaw last year for being “one of a few retail employers who pay the real living wage”. Jesper Brodin is chief executive of Ingka group, the holding company that controls most Ikea stores globally, but in the UK its boss is Peter Jelkeby, who according to documents at Companies House was paid £268,000 in 2019 and £271,000 in 2020. Lush The cosmetics firm was accredited by the LWF in April 2017. It was set up in 1995 by six co-founders: Helen Ambrosen, Liz Bennett, Rowena Bird, Mark Constantine, Mo Constantine and Paul Greaves. Mark Constantine is the current chief executive and the company employs more than 4,000 staff in the UK and 13,652 people globally. The company is private so does not make its chief executive’s pay public. It prides itself on its ethical approach to business and natural handmade products. It previously said that paying the living wage was “another important ethical commitment that we’ve made as a business”. Primark The popular high street clothes shop is not LWF accredited. However, the firm, which employs 78,000 people, has unveiled a sustainability strategy pledging that all workers within its supply chain will be paid the living wage by 2030. The plan also commits the company to ensuring its clothes are made from recyclable or more sustainably sourced materials. Its chief executive, Paul Marchant, said the “new and exciting chapter” would still deliver customers the affordable goods they are accustomed to but “in a way that is better for the planet and the people who make them”. The retailer is owned by Associated British Foods, where the chief executive is George Weston, whose total pay was £1.13m in 2020 and £3.39m in 2021. JD Sports The sportswear company was founded by John Wardle and David Makin in Bury, Greater Manchester in 1981 and is not an accredited LWF employer. There have been no recent announcements or commitments from the firm about paying the living wage for the more than 37,000 staff it employs. The current executive chairman is Peter Cowgill, who has been in the position at the company since March 2004. He was paid £4.29m in 2021 and £4.72m in 2020. Asos The fast fashion retailer is not an accredited LWF employer. However, the company has pledged it will have a net zero impact on the environment by 2030, give customers more information about its supply chain and recruit a more diverse workforce. The previous chief executive, who left in October last year, was Nick Beighton who was paid £1.88m in 2021 and received a total pay packet of £1.73m in 2020. The company is still searching for a replacement CEO, with chief financial officer, Matt Dunn, ruling himself out of the running for the top job.

5/20/2022,"After his brilliant space adventure Ad Astra in 2019, James Gray has come heavily back to Earth. This slightly laborious and self-consciously acted family coming-of-age drama features some perfunctory plot resolutions, and dinner-theatre performances from its all-star cast, including Anthony Hopkins, Jeremy Strong and Anne Hathaway. It is set in Queens, New York in 1980 – the time in which US presidential candidate Ronald Reagan solemnly announced that the US was facing a moral “Armageddon”. But more to the point, Queens is, in 1980, the heartland of the increasingly wealthy and influential Trump family, to whom oblique references are made: Fred Trump (Donald’s dad, played by John Diehl) makes an appearance as does US judge Maryanne Trump (Donald’s sister, played in a steely cameo by Jessica Chastain). But not Donald himself. Banks Repeta plays Paul, a sensitive, creative kid from a hardworking Ukrainian Jewish-descended family: dad Irving (Jeremy Strong) is a careworn, quick-tempered paterfamilias who has done well in the plumbing business: mum Esther (Anne Hathaway) is president of the parent-teacher association at the public (ie, state) school that Paul attends. Irving can only afford one set of school fees, so Paul’s wise-ass elder brother, Ted (Ryan Sell) gets to go to the elitist private institution favoured by the Trump family. And grandad Aaron (Anthony Hopkins), who brought his family from the old country to the US via Liverpool, is a great pal of Paul’s. Paul is keen on art. He is dreamy and inattentive in lessons and has nascent class-clown tendencies, like his natural friend and ally Johnny (Jaylin Webb) – a smart kid who, because he is black, gets into way more trouble than Paul – despite doing pretty much the same things. When Paul and Johnny are caught smoking a joint in the boys’ toilets, Irving gives Paul an old-fashioned, quasi-Goodfellas beating with a belt, and he and Esther decide they just have to find the money to send Paul to the same posh school that Ted goes to, with all its snobs and racists. And so the awful, gradual betrayal of Johnny is under way. In some ways, Paul’s boyhood in Armageddon Time shows us a quasi-Trump, a kid who was brought up around the same time (a little later), from a comparable background facing comparable pressures, but who didn’t become the same guy – or not quite the same guy. Paul does, after all, wind up going to the top Trump school and, sadly, lets Johnny take the rap for some wrongdoing: Paul can use his privilege as a get-out-of-jail-free card. His grandpa tells him always to call out and confront the bigots at that preppy school and this is an emotional moment for them both. But Paul is not shown carrying that through and just starts to fit in at the new school. Maybe the point is that muddled, unhappy, well-meaning Paul could well be a Trump voter a few decades down the line. Gray has given us tough, sinewy and memorable New York movies in the past such as The Yards and We Own the Night, but this is weighed down with a sentimental and self-regarding staginess.",Arts/Film,Armageddon Time review – Hopkins and Hathaway can’t save this stagy tale of a quasi-Trump,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/19/armageddon-time-review-anthony-hopkins-anne-hathaway-trump-reagan-james-gray
5/20/2022,"A 911 dispatcher has been placed on administrative leave and will probably be fired after allegedly hanging up on a Tops supermarket employee during Saturday’s shooting rampage in Buffalo, New York, where a white supremacist allegedly killed 10 people. Latisha Rogers, an assistant office manager at the Tops supermarket, said she called 911 and whispered quietly into the phone about the shooter, who was already in the store. “I called 911, I go through the whole operator and everything, the dispatcher comes on and I’m whispering to her and I said ‘Miss, please send help to 1275 Jefferson – there is a shooter in the store,’” Rogers told WGRZ. “She proceeded in a very nasty tone and says, ‘I can’t hear you, why are you whispering? You don’t have to whisper, they can’t hear you.’ So I continued to whisper and I said ‘Ma’am he’s still in the store, he’s still shooting! I’m scared for my life, please send help!’ Out of nervousness, my phone fell out of my hand, she said something I couldn’t make out, and then the phone hung up,” Rogers said. In a separate interview with Buffalo News, Rogers said, “She got mad at me, hung up in my face.” Rogers said she proceeded to call her boyfriend whom she instructed to call 911. “I felt that lady left me to die yesterday,” she added. On Wednesday, Erie county executive Mark Poloncarz said that the dispatcher had been placed on administrative leave andmay have her employment terminated at the end of the month. “The individual was put on administrative leave pending a hearing which will be held on May 30 in which our intention is to terminate the 911 call taker, who acted totally inappropriately not following protocol,” Poloncarz said. He did not publicly identify the dispatcher, who has been on the job for eight years. Further investigation into the shooting has revealed that Payton Gendron, the 18-year- old suspect, had been plotting the massacre in a series of online statements over the past five months. The Washington Post found that he had made plans as early as December to murder those he regarded as “replacers” – a reference to the racist conspiracy that open immigration policies and high birthrates for Black people are being promoted to displace white voters. After Saturday’s shooting, New York governor Kathy Hochul unveiled a “comprehensive” plan on Wednesday to combat domestic terror and gun violence. She described the attack as “a wake-up call” and included new anti-terrorism measures in her plan, including the requirement of state police to file an “extreme risk protection” order under New York’s “red flag law” when there is credible reason to believe a person could seriously harm themselves or others. “We as a country are facing an intersection of two crises: the mainstreaming of hate speech – including white nationalism, racism and white supremacy – and the easy access to military-style weapons and magazines,” Hochul said, adding that the measures were implemented to address “one of the most pressing threats to public safety across the United States”.",News/US news,‘She got mad’: 911 dispatcher allegedly hung up during Buffalo shooting call,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/19/buffalo-shooting-911-dispatcher
5/20/2022,"Vladimir Putin “had to keep explaining things” to Donald Trump when Trump was US president, the former White House aide Fiona Hill said. “Putin doesn’t like to do that,” Hill told the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. “You could see that he got frustrated many times with President Trump. Even though he loves to be able to spin his own version of events, he wants to have predictability in the person that he’s engaging with.” Under Trump, Hill was senior director for European and Russian affairs on the national security council. She is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. The British-born adviser come to prominence when she testified in Trump’s first impeachment for withholding military aid to Ukraine in an attempt to extract political dirt on opponents including Joe Biden. Putin ordered the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February. Bloody fighting continues. Biden has committed to supporting Ukraine. At the Chicago event, Hill said Putin “thought that somebody like Biden, who’s a trans-Atlanticist, who knows all about Nato, who actually knows where Ukraine is, and actually knows something about the history, and is very steeped in international affairs, would be the right person to engage with as opposed to somebody that you have to explain everything to all the time, honestly”. The Russian president, Hill said, might still be “waiting for us to sue for peace, [to] negotiate away Ukraine”. Trump and Republicans claim Putin would not have invaded if Trump was in power. The Trump administration was dogged by investigations of Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow. Trump was seen to be too close to Putin. Flashpoints included a Helsinki summit in July 2018 when the two leaders met alone but for translators and Trump said he believed Putin over his own intelligence services regarding election interference. Hill was a co-author of a well-received book on Putin. Last year, promoting a memoir, There Is Nothing for You Here, she told the BBC that in Helsinki she considered faking a medical emergency to interrupt Trump’s remarks. “My initial thought was just ‘How can I end this?’” she said. Trump has attacked Hill publicly, calling her “a deep state stiff – with a nice accent”. In April, after Hill compared him to Putin, Trump told the New York Times: “She doesn’t know the first thing she’s talking about. If she didn’t have the accent she would be nothing.” Regarding Putin’s view of Trump, in 2020 Hill told the Guardian: “Trump just wants to sit down with the guy, whoever it is, and create personal chemistry and then everyone else works out the details. He wanted to treat Putin the way he treated Xi [Jinping of China] or [Benjamin] Netanyahu [of Israel]. He wanted to be able to pick up the phone and talk to them. “Putin doesn’t operate like that. Putin takes translators with him for every occasion. The Russians are incredibly organised. They take advantage of every opportunity, every vulnerability, every open door they can walk through.”",News/US news,"Putin ‘had to keep explaining things to Trump’, ex-White House aide says",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/19/trump-putin-biden-ukraine-fiona-hill
5/20/2022,"A country pub has received a framed apology from a fashion publishing giant after being threatened with legal action unless the landlords changed its name. The Star Inn at Vogue was sent a cease-and-desist letter by Vogue’s publisher, Condé Nast, which claimed a link between the two businesses was “likely to be inferred”. The pub has stood in Vogue, a Cornish village, for hundreds of years, while the magazine was not founded until 1916. Condé Nast, which also owns The New Yorker, GQ, Vanity Fair and Wired, has since backed down, sending the pub a framed version of their apology. Its parcel also included a handwritten note, which read: “From one Vogue to another – please accept our apologies.” The pub’s landlord, Mark Graham, said he was taken aback by the response to news of the original letter after people from around the world, including Germany, the Netherlands, Australia and the US, got in touch to offer support. He told the BBC: “I received a letter this morning from a man in his 90s in a care home in London, an ex-Penzance man who said it has brought a little tear in his eye because it reminded him of Cornwall and how rebellious the Cornish are, and how you can’t push them around. “A few people have said, ‘I’ve never heard of your pub, but if I’m in Cornwall it is now on my bucket list to come and visit you’.” Graham joked that the village had come up with a few ideas to “poke fun” at the publisher, which included starting a similarly titled parish magazine, and rearranging a version of Madonna’s hit song, Vogue, to be performed by “some of the village’s larger, hairier men in skimpy clothing” at this year’s ale festival. He added: “To be honest I don’t think they [Vogue magazine] have done too badly out of this mistake either. We are all friends now.” Condé Nast said its team, who “regularly monitor” the use of the name Vogue, were alerted through Companies House. They admitted that “further research” would have identified that a letter was inappropriate in this instance. Graham and his wife, Rachel, bought the pub 17 years ago after going out for a bike ride and finding it closed for the afternoon.

5/20/2022,"Rebekah Vardy has demanded “substantial” damages from Coleen Rooney after enduring “public abuse and ridicule on a massive scale”, as the “Wagatha Christie” libel trial drew to a close at the high court after two weeks of headline-grabbing and occasionally excruciating hearings. Vardy said her life had been made hell as a result of the allegation in 2019 that she was leaking stories from Rooney’s private Instagram account to journalists at the Sun. Hugh Tomlinson QC, acting for Vardy, said his client continued to face mockery, and the media were “full of jokes about this case”. Vardy’s lawyers insist she did not leak stories to the Sun and say the most likely explanation is that Vardy’s agent, Caroline Watt, did so without her client’s knowledge or approval. One of the most serious allegations made by Rooney’s legal team is that Vardy and her agent engaged in a deliberate campaign to destroy evidence. They allege this included the agent dropping her mobile phone in the North Sea after there was a request to search it, as well as the manual deletion of WhatsApp messages by Vardy. Tomlinson said Vardy would have to be “very clever or very cynical” to have undertaken the manual deletion of WhatsApp messages. He said it would be an “extraordinarily complicated conspiracy”, and the loss of back-ups was something that happened “when lay people are working with electronic material”. At one point Vardy approached a court reporter for the Sun and took him to task for a story by a different journalist that appeared in the tabloid on Thursday morning. The article claimed that the entire Vardy family would be moving to the US to escape the negative coverage caused by the case. According to the BBC, Vardy told the reporter angrily that the relocation story was false and had upset her children. “That was cruel, my eldest is in bits,” she said. Rooney and her husband, Wayne, were absent for the first time during the trial after leaving for a family holiday, which had been booked with the expectation that the trial would have finished by Wednesday. Tomlinson told the court that the case against his client was based on dredging up other incidents – such as selling a kiss’n’tell story about Peter Andre – and saying “look at the terrible things she’s done – it’s likely she’s done this as well”. He said he could understand why Rooney suspected Vardy was the leaker but there was no evidence that this was actually the case. “The obvious suspect is Caroline Watt. The case against Mrs Vardy only works if she knew about it and authorised it.” Watt did not give evidence, citing health reasons. Vardy previously told the court that her former agent had been driven to suicidal thoughts by the libel trial, which was brought by Vardy to clear her name. Earlier the court heard closing remarks from Rooney’s barrister, David Sherborne, who alleged that Vardy and her agent engaged in a deliberate conspiracy to destroy evidence. He focused on the loss of Watt’s phone in the North Sea just days after Rooney’s lawyers had asked to search the device. Watt has maintained it was an unfortunate accident that occurred after the boat hit a wave while she was filming the Scottish coastline. Sherborne told the court that the incident was “fishy” and “far from an accident”. He said Vardy had failed to call key witnesses, including her agent. “We have Hamlet, not just without the prince but also the entire royal court.” He insisted Vardy had a long history of giving stories to the Sun, “about her boob jobs and resting bitch face,” arguing she often sought media attention and passed information to the newspaper. Owing to the absence of direct evidence, Rooney’s legal defence has relied on a 300-year-old court ruling, Armory v Delamirie, involving a young chimney sweep who found a piece of jewellery while cleaning a fireplace. When the sweep had it valued, a jeweller surreptitiously removed the gems, leaving behind a number of empty sockets. The 1722 legal ruling set a precedent that if the court can tell that evidence is missing, then the assumption should be that what is missing is of the highest possible value that would fit. Rooney’s lawyers argue this approach applies just as much in a case of missing WhatsApp messages sent by a footballer’s wife as it does in a case involving a missing gem in a piece of 18th-century jewellery. Sherborne told the court that messages recovered from Vardy’s phone – in which Rooney was allegedly called a “cunt” and a “bitch” – were truly damning and embarrassing. Vardy has denied that the terms referred to Rooney. The barrister invoked the 300-year-old precedent and argued that “one can only imagine how badly [Vardy’s] position would look were the court to have access to what she was able to successfully delete. What remains cannot be anything other than the tip of the iceberg.” Mrs Justice Steyn will now consider the evidence before handing down a judgment later in the year.",News/UK news,"Rebekah Vardy subjected to ridicule on a massive scale, libel trial told",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/19/rebekah-vardy-subjected-to-ridicule-on-a-massive-scale-libel-trial-told
