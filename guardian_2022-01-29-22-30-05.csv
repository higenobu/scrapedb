1/29/2022,"Eleanor Perry (Tight) and Daniel Hay-Gordon (Thick) have spent a decade building a unique style, which combines drag, drama, queer culture, lip-syncing, design, mime and high-quality dance. They are extraordinary, and even Perry’s absence from the stage because of Covid couldn’t stop the quality of their working relationship and the power of their imaginations shining through this mixed bill of short pieces. All are choreographed and directed by them, though some are danced by others. The final piece reveals the duo at their absolute sophisticated best, even though Perry is appearing by video link. Cage & Paige: We Could Go On and On pairs the words and movements of the avant-garde composer John Cage with Elaine Paige, queen of the musical, in ways that are hilarious but also revealing. As Cage says: “There are two things that don’t have to mean anything; one is music and the other is laughter. Don’t have to mean anything that is, in order to give us deep pleasure.”  The entire bill, part of the London international mime festival, is propelled by similar principles. Ode to Edith is a tribute to the eccentric poet Edith Sitwell, performed by members of Corali Dance Company (on stage) and the Camberwell Incredibles (on screen), both groups that work with learning diverse artists. The dance itself, complete with wonderful net wigs and jewelled hands, is relatively simple, but it’s performed with considerable verve, and its point – that society determines who is an outsider and who accepted – is resonant. In other numbers, Connor Scott dances as Sid Vicious in a vignette that reveals the singer’s vulnerability as much as his attitude; Harry Alexander twists and turns as Twiggy, catching her gestures despite their physical dissimilarities; Azara Meghie offers a warm-hearted tribute to the inspirational qualities of Grace Jones; and Oxana Panchenko does a bawdy impression of Rasputin. Each piece is beautifully performed and life-enhancing. Short and very sweet indeed.

1/29/2022,"Between A Very British Scandal and American Crime Story (and many more), it seems as if every garish episode of recent-ish history will be retold in a multipart drama. Now coming to Disney+ is the very 90s moment when a graphic home video of Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee was stolen – launching the strange sex tape era of pop culture. Lily James and Sebastian Stan star as the happy, unsuspecting couple.  James, seen last year in second world war romantic drama The Dig (Netflix), was embroiled in a minor scandal of her own in 2020, when paparazzi shots appeared to show her enjoying an intimate scooter ride in Rome with her married co-star from The Pursuit of Love (iPlayer), Dominic West. All of which led to the bizarro moment when West and his wife posed for assembled photographers with a handwritten note declaring “our marriage is strong”. While West’s finest hour surely remains as McNulty in The Wire, he’s had numerous other notable roles, including opposite Helena Bonham Carter in Burton and Taylor (BritBox), revisiting the tumultuous couple’s final performances together in a 1983 production of Noël Coward’s Private Lives. Kate Burton, Richard’s daughter from his first marriage, is an accomplished actor, too. She’s soon to appear in Netflix’s Inventing Anna, a series about New York con woman Anna Delvey. In 2002 she picked up a Tony nomination for her role as Mrs Kendal opposite Billy Crudup in a Broadway revival of The Elephant Man. A 2014 production on Broadway that went to the West End saw Bradley Cooper take on the challenging part of Joseph Merrick. Circa 2006, Burnt’s Bradley Cooper was briefly married to Jennifer Esposito, who in the late 90s featured in the popular political sitcom Spin City. Among its cast was Heather Locklear, one of the 80s and 90s biggest television stars. And long before the passion of Pam & Tommy, she was married to the Mötley Crüe star. All’s fair in love and heavy metal drumming. Watch Craig Gillespie, the Aussie director behind the series, is best known for his comic retelling of another modern scandal in I, Tonya.

1/29/2022,"Nick Kyrgios and Thanasi Kokkinakis claimed their first major title on another raucous night at Melbourne Park with victory over their compatriots, Matthew Ebden and Max Purcell, in the men’s doubles final. The pair’s remarkable journey from wildcard entries to grand slam champions was completed after just over an hour and a half of yet more gripping entertainment on Rod Laver Arena as the childhood friends sealed a 7-5, 6-4 victory.  The match featured a slightly toned-downed version of the showboating that has come to define the game Kyrgios and Kokkinakis brought to the year’s first grand slam, but there was still a dose of crowd controversy with Kyrgios asking for a fan to be ejected as Ebden and Purcell were serving to stay in the match. “Nick I love you brother,” Kokkinakis said on-court after the match. “Man, I can honestly say we did not expect to even come close to this but with the help of you guys all week it has been unbelievable. The coverage it got and the support it got, the coverage, we couldn’t ask for anything more.” Australia were guaranteed a double dose of glory on Saturday night after Ash Barty had earlier ended a 44-year wait for a home player to win a singles title in the same arena. Kyrgios said winning his first grand slam title was “a dream come true”. “I wouldn’t want to do it with anyone else,” he said. “Max has been to a finals twice and Matty has had a hell of a career. I’m just super happy. I don’t even know how we are doing this or what is going on right now to be brutally honest.” Emma Kemp’s full report from Melbourne Park to follow.",Sport/Sport,Kyrgios and Kokkinakis secure doubles title to cap remarkable Australian Open campaign ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/29/kyrgios-and-kokkinakis-secure-doubles-title-to-end-remarkable-australian-open-journey
1/29/2022,"Between greeting regulars at the busy Lisbon bakery where she has worked for two decades – and reaching instinctively for their orders as soon as they cross the threshold – Susana Santos offers her thoughts on an imminent, and altogether less welcome, encounter. Like many of her compatriots, she does not relish the idea of Sunday’s snap general election, which arrives amid a stubbornly lingering pandemic and during a time of economic upheaval and political uncertainty.  “They should have left things as they were. That would have been best,” says Santos, 48. “I’m exhausted. I’m tired of all this. What they’re doing is a joke.” The early election was triggered last December after the fragile, but improbably durable, deal between Prime Minister António Costa’s minority Socialist government and its allies in the Portuguese Communist party and the Left Bloc broke down during negotiations to pass the 2022 budget. After weeks of tense negotiations, the Communists and Left Bloc eventually joined rightwing parties in rejecting the budget bill. Not only did the surprise rupture end the alliance known as the geringonça – or improvised solution – which had made Portugal a rare beacon of European social democracy, it also yielded an election that could see the far-right Chega party become the third biggest group in parliament. For Santos and for many others, the timing could not be worse. The early election will delay the approval of a new spending programme, just as the government was poised to jump-start the economy after the pandemic with €45bn (£38bn) in EU recovery funds. Since 2015, Costa’s administration has led an economic turnaround, reversing unpopular austerity measures, such as the cuts to public sector wages and pensions introduced during the European financial crisis. Last year, the government received praise for spearheading one of the most successful vaccination programmes in Europe and bringing unemployment to pre-pandemic levels. The Socialists’ track record is likely to ensure loyalty from voters such as Santos. “I’ll vote for the Socialists because I don’t earn much,” she says. “They didn’t take our subsidies or anything, so it wasn’t bad – but it hasn’t been easy.” Others are more despondent. Armando Mendes, a 68-year-old retired teacher who now works as a private tutor, is disappointed that the election has come two years early, and pessimistic about the chances of an effective government. “I’ve never failed to vote, but I think this is a clown-show,” he says. “They’re playing games – nothing justifies this.” For Mendes, the main priorities of the next government should be strengthening the national health service – which is still reeling from the pandemic – and investing in improving the school system. He is not enthused by the prospect of another geringonça: “I don’t think any government elected without a majority will manage to get anything done.” Although the polls have shown a close race for first place between Costa’s Socialists and the centre-right Social Democrats (PSD), the latter appears to be pulling ahead. A poll released on Tuesday put support for the PSD on 34.4% – up from 28.5% a week earlier – and backing for the Socialists at 33.8%, down from 38.1%. The PSD, which is led by the economist Rui Rio, has pledged to cut taxes on corporate profits and personal income, should it emerge victorious. “We have to reinforce the competitiveness of our economy,” Rio said at the beginning of January. “We have to turn our economic policy towards companies because they are the ones that create better wages and better jobs.” Costa, meanwhile, has denounced his former allies in the Left Bloc and Communist party as “irresponsible” for torpedoing his budget, and is urging voters to give him an outright majority so the Socialists can govern alone. However, neither the Socialists nor the PSD look to be on course for an overall majority, meaning that deals will have to be struck and alliances forged by whichever party wins the most votes. The same poll that gave the PSD the lead also suggested that the far-right Chega could leapfrog the Left Bloc to become the third largest force in parliament. Chega, which is led by the belligerent former TV football pundit, André Ventura, won a seat in the 2019 general election, taking 1.3% of the vote. But when Ventura – an ally of Marine Le Pen of France and Italy’s Matteo Salvini who has repeatedly sought to demonise Portugal’s Roma community – ran in the 2021 presidential election, he attracted 11.9% of the vote. Pedro Magalhães, a political scientist at the University of Lisbon’s Institute of Social Sciences, says Chega will almost certainly consolidate its presence in parliament and could even win 10 seats, thanks to a populist strategy complete with some familiar enemies. “They’ve plugged into attitudes that are either deep-seated in Portugal – prejudice against Gypsies, the perception that the entire political class is totally corrupt – or that, although they may not be widespread, are nevertheless prevalent enough to make a difference: the notions that social transfers go to the ones who least deserve it or that immigration is a threat. “They have a solid presence in social media, good mobilisation, and the beginnings of a true party structure,” he says. “Having said that, whether they can form a parliamentary group of MPs with minimal quality and effectiveness is going to be a major test of their growth as a party.” While Rio has ruled out including Chega in any coalition, the far-right party could still play a big role in shaping and propping up a PSD government. Across the border in Spain, the far-right Vox party has proved crucial to the formation of three rightwing regional governments and is the third biggest party in the national parliament. For many voters, the idea of a powerful far right in a country that is fiercely proud of reinventing itself after the end of the Salazar dictatorship is deeply troubling. Miguel Ameixas, a mechanical engineering student in Lisbon, is still weighing up his vote. “What scares me the most is the prospect of a rightwing majority, with the far right included,” he says.",News/World news,Splits in left are set to boost far-right TV pundit in Portugal’s snap election,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/29/splits-in-left-are-set-to-boost-far-right-tv-pundit-in-portugals-snap-election
