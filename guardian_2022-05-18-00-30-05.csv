5/18/2022,"A gunman motivated by hatred against Taiwan chained shut the doors of a California church and hid firebombs before shooting at a gathering of mostly elderly Taiwanese parishioners, killing a man who tackled him, authorities said. David Chou, 68, of Las Vegas, a US citizen whom authorities say grew up in Taiwan, drove to Orange county on Saturday and the next day attended a lunch held by Irvine Taiwanese Presbyterian church, which worships at Geneva Presbyterian church in the community of Laguna Woods. Though he knew no one there, he spent about an hour mingling with about 40 attendees and then executed his plot, authorities said at a news conference. Chou chained the doors and put super glue in the keyholes, according to authorities. He had two 9mm handguns – legally purchased years ago in Las Vegas – and three bags, containing among other things four Molotov-cocktail-type incendiary devices and extra ammunition. He opened fire and in the ensuing chaos Dr John Cheng, 52, tackled him, allowing other parishioners to subdue him and tie him up with extension cords. Cheng died and five people were wounded, the oldest 92. Sheriff Don Barnes called Cheng’s heroism “a meeting of good versus evil” that probably saved the lives “of upwards of dozens of people.” Chou was booked on suspicion of murder and attempted murder and jailed on $1m bail. He was expected to appear in state court Tuesday. It was not immediately clear whether he had an attorney who could speak on his behalf. A federal hate crimes investigation is also ongoing. Chou had worked as a security guard in Las Vegas, authorities said. There was no immediate word on why Chou chose to target the church in Laguna Woods, a scenic coastal area about 50 miles south-east of Los Angeles whose population mainly consists of retirees and is near a large gated community. Barnes said the motive for the shooting was Chou’s hatred toward Taiwan that was documented in handwritten notes that authorities found. Chou’s family apparently was among many forcibly removed from mainland China to Taiwan some time after 1948, Orange county district attorney Todd Spitzer said. Relations between mainlanders forced to flee a Communist takeover and native Taiwanese were frequently tense as the new arrivals crowded into slums and military communities. Separated by language and lifestyle, bullying and confrontation were frequent as President Chiang Kai-shek tightly restricted civil liberties under nearly four decades of martial law. The Presbyterian church is the most prominent of the Christian denominations in Taiwan and was closely identified with the pro-democracy movement during the martial law era and later with the Taiwan independence cause. Barnes referred to Chou as an immigrant from China but Taiwan’s Central News Agency says it interviewed Louis M Huang, director general of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Los Angeles, and he confirmed that Chou was born in Taiwan in 1953. Barnes said Chou acted alone and was “not believed to be associated with any specific church or any religion, and there’s no direct connection to the church or any member of the church that we’re aware of”. Balmore Orellana, a former neighbor, said Chou’s life unraveled after his wife left him last year and moved to Taiwan. Before, Chou had been a pleasant man who used to own the Las Vegas apartment building where he lived until being evicted in February, Orellana told the Associated Press. Chou also received a head injury and other serious injuries in an attack by a tenant, the neighbor said. Last summer, a gun was fired inside Chou’s apartment and the bullet entered Orellana’s apartment, although nobody was hurt, Orellana said. Police reports about the assault and the shooting were not immediately available Monday. Tensions between China and Taiwan are at the highest in decades, with Beijing stepping up its military harassment by flying fighter jets toward the self-governing island. China has not ruled out force to reunify with Taiwan, which split from the mainland during a civil war in 1949. Taiwan’s president has condemned the deadly shooting. Taiwan’s chief representative in the US, Bi-khim Hsiao, offered condolences on Twitter. “I join the families of the victims and Taiwanese American communities in grief and pray for the speedy recovery of the wounded survivors,” Hsiao wrote on Sunday. Chinese embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu told the AP via email that the Chinese government has “consistently condemned incidents of violence. We express our condolences to the victims and sincere sympathy to the bereaved families and the injured.” Those wounded by gunshots included an 86-year-old woman as well as four men, ages 66, 75, 82 and 92, the sheriff’s department said. Authorities on Monday said two of the wounded were in good condition, two were in stable condition and the status of the fifth patient was undetermined. Jerry Chen, a longtime member of the church, said about 40 congregants had gathered in the fellowship hall for a luncheon after a morning service to welcome their former Pastor Billy Chang, a beloved and respected community member who had served the church for 20 years. Chang moved back to Taiwan two years ago. This was his first time back stateside, Chen said. Barnes said Cheng, a sports medicine doctor who is survived by a wife and two children, charged at the shooter and attempted to disarm him, allowing others to intervene. Chang hit the gunman on the head with a chair before other parishioners subdued him.",News/US news,California gunman locked church doors before firing at Taiwanese worshippers – police,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/17/california-gunman-laguna-woods-taiwanese-church
5/18/2022,"With just two games left of this season, Southampton are running out of time to stage their annual 9-0 drubbing: a wonderful festival of fun that sits nicely alongside Monty Python and The Fiver as one of this country’s finest comedic traditions, oozing in both slapstick and classic British self-deprecation. As it happens, with Liverpool four points adrift of Manchester City (and crucially, just seven behind on goal difference) in one of the most engaging title races in years, a 9-0 thrashing from the Merseyside Reds would suit both Jürgen Klopp and supporters of The Narrative very nicely. Indeed, it would mean that if $tevie Mbe’s Aston Villa beat Pep Guardiola’s juggernaut on Sunday, Liverpool would ride to the title with just a draw at home to Wolves. Small margins – lots of ifs, buts and maybeeeeeeeeeeees – but they all count. And while most of us are approaching this week with all the excitement of Robert Smith at a Rock & Roll Hall of Fame ceremony, there are some, particularly with Sky Sports microphones in hand, that are working themselves into assorted frenzies. However, the chances of Liverpool scoring nine and keeping a clean sheet at Southampton have been significantly reduced with the news that both Mo Salah and Virgil van Dijk will miss the trip south due to various minor-knacks. “They are both OK,” sighed Klopp, his voice barely audible over a nearby orchestra of tiny violins. “The target for both would be that they could be involved again at the weekend. Properly involved. On the bench and on for a few minutes or start – we will see with that because that would be perfect for the [Madrid] game. If not, we take each day afterwards. It is very positive and we have no doubt about the [Big Cup] final but we are pretty realistic about the Wolves game. But [Southampton], not.” And so, the plucky Reds will have to make do with Joël Matip, arguably one of the best centre-backs in the league this year, and £36m Ibrahima Konaté in defence, with an attack that must somehow be fashioned from Sadio Mané, Luis Díaz, Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino. If Liverpool can pull off the unthinkable and if City ‘do a Madrid’ at home to Villa, perhaps there will even be proper celebrations. Or maybe everyone will sit glumly on their phones, sipping on a can of full-fat fizzy pop, waiting for the next morning’s video analysis meeting and the next season’s chase towards a century of points. Hurrah! “I want people to know the real me … I asked myself if I should wait until I’ve retired to come out. No other player in the professional game here is out. However, I knew that would lead to a long time of lying and not being able to be myself or lead the life that I want to. I am hoping that by coming out I can be a role model, to help others come out if they want to. I am only 17 but I am clear that this is what I want to do and if, by me coming out, other people look at me and feel maybe they can do it as well, that would be brilliant” – Blackpool striker Jake Daniels on his decision to end decades of silence within men’s football by becoming the first player in the UK to come out as gay since Justin Fashanu in 1990. “I sat down with Jamie Vardy and he had a coffee.

Nope, it didn’t help. Boos, bangers and a big elephant in the Newcastle room … it’s David Squires. “A moment of kudos and congratulations for Jake Daniels. It’s not often that footballers will do something that could genuinely improve the lives of other people – probably people they’ll never meet – so he deserves all the praise coming his way. Sorry – no jokes or witticisms, but it’s The Fiver” – Jim Hearson (and others). “Yesterday’s Quote of the Day accused James Milner of dadding the millennials about screen time, but James Milner (born 1986) is a millennial. I don’t want to accuse The Fiver of being behind the times, but as one boomer to another …” – Chris Boys. “It’s finally happened. Arsenal are now officially the Spursiest team in north London. They’re now more Spursy than Spurs! Unless …” – Paul Southgate. “I was a bit concerned when I saw the picture of Chelsea’s Ji So-yun with the lid of the FA Cup on her head (yesterday’s Still Want More?). After winning our local tin pot, one of my mates planted the lid on my bald scalp thinking it would be humorous for post-match celebratory photos, as in countless FA Cup photos down the ages. But all those figurines that adorn the top of the cups are usually screwed in from above, meaning the metal protrusion below penetrated my skin.

5/18/2022,"After a recurrence of Covid that paused production for the second time in a month, Stephen Colbert returned to the Late Show on Monday evening. “While I am happy to be back, I am sad to say that as you know, the #1 story today is not only tragic, it is tragically common,” he opened. “Because the attack in Buffalo this weekend is not the first overtly racist mass shooting this country has witnessed in recent years.” “It’s a truly horrific crime,” he continued of the shooting in which a white 18-year-old suspect targeted a supermarket in a black neighborhood, killing 10 people. “And of course our hearts are with the victims and their families and their community. In this case, a predominantly black neighborhood that the suspect targeted after spelling out his motivations clearly in an online rant in which he referred to something called ‘replacement theory’.” Said theory is a white supremacist conspiracy that holds white people will be replaced in America by people of color. “Obviously that is racist and hateful and crazy,” Colbert noted. “Also, if you think white people are being replaced, then who’s shopping at Vineyard Vines.” “Where does anyone get an idea that monstrous?” he wondered. “Well, it used to be only from the farthest rightwing fringe organizations – your Storm Fronts, your neo-Nazis. But these days, you can see it every night on TV” thanks to Fox News and host Tucker Carlson, who has advanced the idea that a “cabal of elites want to force demographic change through immigration” in over 400 episodes of his show. According to the New York Times, producers sometimes found raw material for his show from the same internet corners that the Buffalo shooter did. “That doesn’t mean Tucker’s responsible for what happened,” said Colbert. “But I would hope it would give anyone pause to find out that their browser history matches that of a mass murderer.” Recent polls found that 50% of Republicans agree with, as Colbert called it, “this garbage, and not just because it’s being mainstreamed by Fox News, but because it’s being mainstreamed by high-ranking Republican officials”. Colbert pointed to the House GOP conference chair, Elise Stefanik, who published a series of Facebook ads last year claiming that “radical Democrats” planned to grant amnesty to immigrants to “overthrow our current electorate and create a permanent liberal majority in Washington”. “Oh, and you know what those liberals will do with their powerful permanent majority?” he mocked. “Beg Joe Manchin for paid family leave, and then when he doesn’t vote for it say, ‘oh, OK then, is there something else we could do for you? What if we fed coal directly to dolphins?’” On Late Night, Seth Meyers also tore into the right’s embrace of racist replacement theory. “It should be easy for a healthy political party in a healthy political system to condemn white nationalism, as well as the dangerous and deeply racist replacement theory that comes with it, and yet of course there are prominent figures on the right who insist while spreading it themselves that it doesn’t even exist,” he explained. Meyers played a clip from Carlson’s show from August 2019: “if you were to assemble a list, a hierarchy of concerns or problems this country faces, where would white supremacy be on the list? Right up there with Russia, probably. It’s actually not a real problem in America … it’s a hoax.” “First of all, you don’t have to be a card-carrying member of a white supremacist organization to be a white supremacist,” said Meyers. “It’s not Costco – you can be a white supremacist without being an official member, the same way you can watch movies without having a Blockbuster card. “But of course, he wants to pretend it’s not a problem. Because he’s also openly and repeatedly promoted replacement theory on his show,” Meyers added before several clips of Carlson fretting about “obedient” immigrants from “third world countries” pushing out white Americans. “Prominent figures on the right have been parroting this depraved and deeply racist ideology for years now,” Meyers concluded. “And on top of being bigoted, dehumanizing and dangerous, it’s also just breathtakingly dumb. It’s so dumb even they can’t actually explain the logic.” And on the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon started with the first public congressional hearing on UFOs in over 50 years, to be held on Tuesday. “Now that all the problems on Earth have been solved, on to UFOs!” he joked. Since 2004, 144 people have called in a UFO sighting, which means “you have a better chance of spotting a UFO than a Home Depot employee.” Meanwhile, Jeff Bezos and the White House have gone back and forth on Twitter after Biden blamed corporations for inflation, and the Amazon CEO blamed inflation on the president’s stimulus plans. “Now Bezos is gonna buy Twitter from Elon Musk just to ban Biden,” Fallon quipped. “Things are getting intense – right now the CIA is spying on Bezos and Alexa is spying on Biden. “That’s right, it’s Amazon versus the government,” he added. “So now we know how the drone war will begin.” And McDonald’s announced it will sell all of its businesses in Russia after three decades in the country. “Sad news for Russians who will now probably live 20 years longer,” Fallon joked. “Right now a Russian guy is frantically sprinting to McDonald’s to try to redeem his Monopoly stickers.”",Arts/Culture,Colbert on ‘replacement theory’: ‘It’s being mainstreamed by Fox News’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/17/stephen-colbert-replacement-theory-seth-meyers-jimmy-fallon

5/18/2022,"The fate of hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers who have ended weeks of resistance at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol remains unclear, after the fighters surrendered and were transferred to Russian-controlled territory. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister said they would be swapped in a prisoner exchange, but some Russian officials said they could be tried or even executed. MPs in Russia’s State Duma said they would propose new laws that could derail prisoner exchanges of fighters who Moscow claims are “terrorists”. Russia called the Azovstal operation a mass surrender, while the Ukrainian army said the soldiers defending the steel plant had “performed their combat task” and that the main goal was now to save their lives. “Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive,” said the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a video address. For weeks, hundreds of troops have been holed up in a warren of tunnels and bunkers underneath the steelworks, as Russian forces took control of the rest of the city after turning much of it into an uninhabitable wasteland. Many of those stuck at Azovstal had serious injuries, with limited medical care and dwindling supplies. In the last few weeks, civilians who had also taken cover in the plant were rescued after a deal was brokered by the International Committee of the Red Cross to allow them to leave for Ukrainian-controlled territory. Ukraine had been pushing for a deal that would also allow the fighters to retreat to Ukrainian-controlled areas, or for their evacuation to a neutral country. However, with that not forthcoming, Ukrainian officials announced in the early hours of Tuesday that the defence of the plant was in effect over. “This was the only option,” said the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, on Tuesday. Russia’s defence ministry said 265 Ukrainian fighters surrendered at the plant, including 51 seriously injured soldiers who would be transferred to hospitals in Novoazovsk in Russian-controlled territory in east Ukraine. It was not immediately clear how many Ukrainian troops remained in the plant. Footage shared by pro-Russian social media accounts showed groups of soldiers carrying out the wounded on stretchers amid the devastation outside the plant. “An exchange procedure will take place for their return home,” said Maliar. The deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk also said the fighters would be exchanged. “God willing, everything will be fine,” she wrote. Zelenskiy sounded a more cautious note. “The work of bringing the boys home continues, and this work needs delicacy – and time,” he said. Details of the agreement that led to the evacuation remain unclear, and a flurry of hardline statements from Russian officials suggested an exchange could still be some way off. Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, promised the fighters who surrendered would be treated “in accordance with international standards”, but this was immediately undermined by statements from two Russian officials. Leonid Slutsky, a Russian MP who took part in negotiations with Ukraine earlier in the war, suggested Russia should lift its moratorium on the death penalty for fighters from the Azov regiment, one of the main forces defending the steelworks, calling them “animals in human form”. “Nazi criminals should not be exchanged,” said Vyacheslav Volodin, one of Russia’s most powerful officials and the chair of the State Duma, during a speech on Tuesday. “Our country treats those who surrendered or were captured humanely. But with regards to Nazis, our position should be unchanged: these are war criminals and we must do everything so that they stand trial.” Volodin did not directly address the surrender of the troops at Azovstal in his statement but the context was clear as Russia’s defence ministry released video of the evacuation of the Ukrainian fighters on Tuesday morning, saying some of them were members of the Azov battalion. Russia’s ministry of justice appealed to the supreme court to declare the Azov regiment a terrorist organisation on Tuesday, possibly introducing another hurdle to a potential exchange. Azov has been a key part of the Russian propaganda narrative about the war in Ukraine, which was originally launched with the supposed goal of “denazification”. It was formed in 2014 as a volunteer militia to fight Russia-backed forces in east Ukraine and many of its original members had far-right extremist views. Since then, the unit has been integrated into the Ukrainian national guard and its commanders say it has moved away from its far-right origins. The defence of Mariupol has come to symbolise heroism in the face of the Russian attack for many millions of Ukrainians. As well as the boost to morale, Ukrainian military sources have claimed that by putting up such a fierce fight for Mariupol, the Russian army’s advance was stalled. On Twitter, the Zelenskiy adviser Mykhailo Podolyak compared the Azovstal defenders to the small force of Spartans who held out against a much larger attacking force in the battle of Thermopylae in the fifth century BC. The defence of Mariupol “completely changed the course of the war” and “ruined Russia’s plans to capture the east of Ukraine”, he wrote. Sandra Krotevych, the sister of Azov’s chief of staff, Bohdan Krotevych, said she had been in contact with her brother at 5am on Tuesday morning and he was still on the territory of Azovstal, but since then she had not heard from him. In recent weeks, she said, as the supplies hoarded in the steelworks began to dwindle and Russian strikes on the plant continued, the soldiers had been eating only once a day and had been drinking water from pipes and other unclean sources. Sandra Krotevych said the fighters had long realised Mariupol no longer had strategic importance for the Ukrainian army and were hoping to be able to bury their dead and evacuate their injured, but were holding out for a deal that would have allowed them to leave to Ukraine-controlled territory or a third country. “To put it mildly, I’m a bit surprised. I am not happy about it and I would have liked to hear security guarantees before this happened,” she said in a telephone interview. Now, the fighters are at the mercy of Russian authorities, with hardline commentators demanding they are not exchanged. On state-funded RT, the commentator Anton Krasovsky called the evacuees “wounded terrorists” and demanded they should not be handed over to Ukraine. “Any Azov member given to Kyiv will be treated as our defeat, as our Russian capitulation,” said Krasovsky. He called on his viewers “not to allow this”, saying there should be a trial and “RT can hold a livestream for their wives”. Amid such rhetoric from Russia, Sandra Krotevych called on the international community to find a way to ensure the soldiers were returned to Ukraine. “Their lives are in the hands of international leaders. If they can find a way to save them, then all the citizens of Ukraine will be extremely grateful. They are heroes for the whole of Ukraine,” she said.",News/World news,Fate of hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers unclear as Azovstal resistance ends,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/17/fate-hundreds-ukrainian-soldiers-unclear-azovstal-resistance-ends
5/18/2022,"A contact lens that can release a drug if it detects high pressure within the eye has been created by scientists who say it could help treat glaucoma. Glaucoma is an eye disease that involves damage to the optic nerve, and can lead to blindness if not treated. According to the charity Glaucoma UK, the most common form of the disease, known as primary open angle glaucoma, is thought to affect almost 10% of people older than 75. This form is generally caused by increased pressure within the eye, usually as a result of a buildup of fluid. Researchers in China revealed they have developed a contact lens that can sense an increase in pressure within the eye and release an anti-glaucoma drug should the pressure exceed a certain level. Writing in the journal Nature Communications, the team describe how they created the device using an upper and lower lens, with a snowflake-shaped pressure sensor and wireless power transfer device sandwiched between them around the rim of the lenses. The arrangement appears to give the effect of the wearer having golden irises. However, the team say the design allows the necessary components to be included in the device without blocking the wearer’s view or irritating the eye. When the pressure inside the eye increases, the gap between the upper and lower lenses decreases. This is detected by the pressure sensor by means of a cantilever. The sensor then sends a signal to the wireless system which subsequently triggers the release of an anti-glaucoma drug, from a hydrogel attached to an electrode, and enables it to cross the cornea of the eye. The drug, brimonidine, acts to reduce the pressure within the eye. The study reveals that the contact lenses have so far been tested on pigs’ eyes and on the eyes of living rabbits – albeit with smaller-sized lenses – although trials have yet to be carried out in humans. The researchers note the lenses are not only soft and minimally invasive but are also battery-free, adding that the approach could be expanded to help tackle other eye diseases. Prof Zubair Ahmed from the Institute of Inflammation and Ageing at the University of Birmingham, who was not involved in the work, said the research was potentially very exciting, adding that a rise in pressure within the eye was a significant problem for most people with glaucoma. “Here, the researchers have developed a minimally invasive contact lens that can detect these changes in pressure within the eye to provide real-time monitoring, but the contact lens can also respond by allowing on-demand drug delivery directly to the eye,” he said. There was potential to develop the technology further, he added. “We can now imagine that a glaucoma sufferer wearing these contact lenses will not only receive real-time information about the pressures within the eye, since the contact lens has built-in wireless capacity and can easily communicate with an app on your smartphone, but also receive, for example, pressure-relieving drugs when needed. “The materials required to create such contact lenses are inexpensive and soon could be mass-produced,” he added.",News/Science,Contact lens that can release drug could be used to treat glaucoma,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/may/17/contact-lens-release-drug-could-treat-glaucoma
5/18/2022,"I’m asking David Best about the significance of objects and there’s a stunned silence on the line. “When you ask me that, I’m still thinking about your husband dying in 2018,” he finally replies before pausing again – overwhelmed by my very personal cue. “Just the fact that someone is willing to tell me that their husband died. That’s a really generous gift that you’re sharing. My god, it’s just such a privilege to be in this position.” Best spends about a third of his time talking to people like me who have lost something irreplaceable. Whereas my exploration of grief reluctantly began at a hospice in London, Best’s was initiated, over 20 years ago, among the arid crests of Nevada’s Black Rock desert. The sculptor was working with a young artist called Michael Hefflin at the time, making a contribution for the Burning Man festival, when Hefflin took off on his motorbike one night, “racing at the moon at 140mph”, and was killed. At the cemetery, his friends said that Michael would want them to go to the festival. So they did. Best brought some scrap wood from a toy factory, “and we built this thing – nothing to do with spiritual bullshit, just a thing. But as we started building, it became obvious to these kids that we were making something for the friend who they had lost.” They lit it “unceremoniously” and it went up in flames. The next year, Burning Man asked him to build a temple. “I thought, what would I dedicate a temple to if I was building one?” He imagined a single person who had taken their life. He imagined the guilt or confusion that might be left behind for those who were grieving. “I wanted the person who had experienced that loss to celebrate their son or their mother,” he says. That year, 10,000 people wrote down the names of their departed loved ones and placed them inside the structure before it was set on fire. Since Best built that first Burning Man temple in 2000, the Californian artist has made many more. This afternoon, he is talking to me from a production cabin on a hill in Bedworth, Warwickshire, in a spot called the Miners’ Welfare Park – the site of an old colliery in “the town that never forgets” – where he is constructing Sanctuary, a work commissioned by the Artichoke Trust to commemorate Britain’s loss during the Covid-19 pandemic. Made out of intricate panels of birch plywood, it is a structure that Artichoke’s Helen Marriage describes as “the most incredible giant jigsaw puzzle”. Best’s pyramidal structures don’t just acknowledge the transience of life, they welcome it in – and Sanctuary is no different. Over the course of a week, the public will be encouraged to donate words, objects or mementos to adorn the walls, and the spaces between. “No building should be more important than the people who walk into it,” Best says. “We’re not building a well-crafted castle, we’re building something that feels safe.” It is within this relative safety that grievers will bring their memories, and leave them behind; not to forget, but perhaps to make their peace with the past. “What’s permanent?” Best asks. In many ways, the title of this structure poses this question, too. The medieval Latin etymology of the word “sanctuary” means “right of asylum.” And what is grief, if not a form of homelessness? Best isn’t making a temple for 10,000 people, he says. He’s making it for you. Objects can be tough to let go of, he tells me, and he’s conscious of this responsibility. “I have to be trustworthy. If you bring something, I promise we’ll protect it,” he says. On Saturday 28 May, his living sculpture, bejewelled with thousands of keepsakes and scraps of handwritten paper, will be ceremonially set alight in what Best and Artichoke hope will be a cathartic release. At the time of writing, the total UK mortality figure from Covid-19 stands at 177,000 deaths. Part of the nation’s grief involves recovering our sight of the individual: parents and partners, siblings and friends. “The anger that I’m feeling, permeating your country right now with Boris Johnson,” Best says. “I’m hearing from people walking around here saying, ‘Look what’s happened, you let my people die.’” Collective grief and memory will be offered up to the flames. Either a person can burn something and it’s gone, or they can burn it and it’s saved. The decision, Best tells me, is unique to every one of us. He recalls a man who came up to him during the construction of one of his temples. “My son died by suicide,” the father told him, “and you set him free.” There may be those who call this all theatrics. But there is a purpose to these structures that goes beyond the visible act of dropping a match and setting something alight. Best isn’t blind to the naysayers. It could be “hocus pocus bullshit” for some people, he says. “But if you need someone to say, ‘You’re OK,’ then you don’t doubt it.” Towards the end of our conversation, we inevitably return to my late husband. We circle back to objects and things. “What do you have left from your husband?” he asks me, as we discuss what I might bring. “I’ve made these little windows, so I could give you a niche.

Black Truck by the folk artist Maud Lewis sold for 10 times its assessed value, setting a new high mark for a painter whose popularity has surged in recent years. “In a time of great turmoil and change the art world lived vicariously through Maud Lewis, her story, and her art,” Ethan Miller, head of the Ontario auction house, said in a statement on Tuesday. Before the weekend auction, the highest price ever recorded for a work by Lewis was C$67,250. Lewis lived in poverty for most of her life and her output as a painter declined in her final years as the effects of rheumatoid arthritis took hold of her body. While she and her husband sold paintings by the roadside to tourists visiting Nova Scotia, her distinct and cheery work did not receive international acclaim until the decades after her death. Her struggles and success were documented in the 2016 biopic Maudie, which introduced the work of Lewis to a larger audience. The auction house said the purchaser of Black Truck increased their initial bid increment by C$10,000 after watching the film the night before the auction. Irene Demas, who as a young chef acquired the work in exchange for a grilled cheese sandwich, told the Guardian in an email she was in “disbelief” at the sale. She and her husband, Tony, had an arrangement with the artist John Kinnear that in exchange for grilled cheese sandwiches, they would be able to choose from a selection of paintings by Kinnear and in some cases, works by his friends. One morning in 1973, Kinnear brought in a series by the Maritime artist, whose distinctive style caught his eye and whose struggles tugged at his sympathies. Among those paintings was Black Truck, which has hung in Demas’s house for five decades. In a series of letters, Lewis thanked Kinnear for his kindness and his generosity in supplying her paints and prepared boards. The three hand-written letters, which were also up for sale, fetched C$70,000, far above their $5,000 estimate.",Arts/Art and design,"Painting traded for a cheese sandwich in 1973 sold at auction for C$350,000",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/17/maud-lewis-painting-black-truck-swapped-cheese-sandwich-sold
5/18/2022,"A man has been found guilty of the murder of Shani Warren, whose body was found bound and gagged in a lake 35 years ago. A jury at Reading crown court found Donald Robertson guilty of the imprisonment, indecent assault and murder of the 26-year-old, after the discovery of new DNA evidence. He was also found guilty of the kidnap and rape of a 16-year-old girl in July 1981, who was reported being attacked less than four miles away from where Warren’s body was found in Taplow Lake, Buckinghamshire, in April 1987. The court heard Robertson had convictions for raping two girls aged 14 and 17 in separate incidents in August 1981 and June 1987. He also has a conviction for burglary with intent to commit rape, and the kidnap of a woman in an incident in April 1990. Prosecutors said the cornerstone of the case against Robertson was DNA evidence that emerged decades after the attack on Warren and the rape of the 16-year-old girl. The jury was told DNA traces found on the underwear of both victims as well as on a mouth gag used on Warren were a match for the defendant. Robertson, who is in prison and has not attended the trial, did not give evidence in his defence.",News/UK news,Man guilty of killing Shani Warren 35 years after murder,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/17/man-guilty-of-killing-shani-warren-35-years-after
5/18/2022,"Mental health campaigners have sounded alarm over a leaked Home Office report into the anti-extremism programme Prevent, which suggests those without extremist views are being referred to the programme to access faster mental health services. Draft extracts of the leaked report by William Shawcross, seen by the Guardian, warn of a “serious misallocation of resources” and that the programme is being misused because of the strain on mental health provision. “In my assessment, Prevent is carrying the weight for mental health services,” the report says. “Vulnerable people who do not necessarily pose a terrorism risk are being referred to Prevent in order to access other types of much-needed support. This is a serious misallocation of resources and risks diverting attention from the threat itself.” James Starkie, a former Home Office adviser who founded the No Time To Wait campaign to speed up access to mental health support, said the Home Office must investigate the referrals. “If people are being referred to the Prevent programme simply to gain mental health support then it needs to stop immediately. These claims in the leaked report should be investigated by government,” he said. “It cannot be right that people suffering with mental health issues are being labelled extremist simply to access the help they need. I created the No Time to Wait campaign to ensure people didn’t have to wait for the help they needed. This only shows how important that is.” A number of community and anti-fascist groups expressed further alarm at the leaked findings, which also suggested there had been too narrow a focus on Islamist extremism and too broad on rightwing terror. Shawcross has previously been criticised for comments he made about Muslims as director of the Henry Jackson society, where he said in 2012 that: “Europe and Islam is one of the greatest, most terrifying problems of our future.” A former Home Office counter-extremism official, who asked to remain anonymous, said the government would use the number of terror attacks to justify an increased focus on Muslims. “It’s very shortsighted and suits Shawcross’s agenda,” they said. “The government has been reluctant to look at the definition of ‘Islamist’ itself, which feeds wider anti-Muslim sentiment.” They added that the government had still not responded to Sara Khan’s flagship review into counter-extremism. Nick Lowles, the chief executive of Hope Not Hate, the UK’s leading antifascism and antiracism campaign group, said the leaked draft was “very worrying” and raised questioned about how different forms of extremism could be pitted against each other. “For far too long, far-right radicalisation has been an issue that has not gotten the attention it deserves, and at a time when growing numbers of young people are being attracted to far-right politics and dangerous conspiracy theories, we cannot become complacent about the threat far-right radicalisation poses,” he said. “Prevent, and indeed the wider police approach to violent extremism, should be based on threat and the potential for violence, not pitting one form of extremism against another.” Zara Mohammed, the secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, which has repeatedly raised concerns about Prevent and the role of Shawcross leading the review, said: “Prevent has alienated Muslims and is now being politicised by divisive ideologues keen to frame Muslims as a phantom fifth column. As such, we are not surprised with suggestions that far-right extremism be de-prioritised. “It comes in a week where a terrorist in the United States has gunned down African Americans using far-right ideas such as the ‘Great Replacement theory’ and Islamophobic tropes. These ideas have sadly been mainstreamed.”",News/UK news,Alarm as leak reveals Prevent ‘carrying the weight’ for mental health services,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/17/alarm-as-leak-reveals-prevent-carrying-the-weight-for-mental-health-services
5/18/2022,"Finland’s parliament has overwhelmingly approved a government proposal to join Nato, as the country’s president said he was sure it and neighbouring Sweden would overcome Turkish opposition to their historic membership bids. A day after Sweden confirmed its intention to join the alliance, Finnish MPs voted by 188 votes to eight to back the government’s proposal to do likewise, paving the way for simultaneous applications to be submitted within hours. It came as the White House announced that the Finnish president, Sauli Niinistö, and Sweden’s prime minister, Magdalena Andersson would meet the US president, Joe Biden, on Thursday to discuss their Nato applications. Ankara has said it will not support either application, citing Sweden and Finland’s history of hosting members of Kurdish militant groups and decisions in 2019 to impose arms export embargos on Ankara over Turkey’s military operations in Syria. Niinistö said during an official visit to Stockholm on Tuesday that Turkey’s stance had “changed very quickly and become harder during the last few days”, but he was sure “constructive discussions” would resolve the situation. Niinistö said his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, had backed the non-aligned countries’ intention to join Nato when they spoke a month ago but in the past week “he has said, ‘not favourable’. We have to continue our discussion. I am optimistic.” Erdoğan on Monday said Ankara would oppose the applications and there was no point diplomats even coming to Ankara to discuss it. Turkey alleges Finland and Sweden shelter people it says are linked to groups it designates as terrorist. In a radical policy reversal triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Swedish government confirmed its intention to apply to join the 30-member alliance on Monday, after a similar announcement by Finland’s leaders a day earlier. The two countries are expected to deliver their Nato membership applications jointly by the end of Tuesday. Ann Linde, the foreign minister, signed Sweden’s request on Tuesday, while her Finnish counterpart, Pekka Haavisto, said Finland’s would be completed before the end of the day, Swedish media reported. Addressing the Swedish parliament, Niinistö said the two neighbours “took peace for granted” but on 24 February “the peace was broken” – a reference to the date of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Our old ways of handling things no longer correspond to the new situation,” he said. “Our relations with Russia have changed.” Nato accession requires the unanimous approval of all 30 members, and while it is unclear how serious an obstacle Turkey’s objections will prove, many analysts believe Erdoğan – who faces elections next year – is seeking concessions for domestic political advantage and will not ultimately veto the Nordic nations’ applications. “They know Sweden and Finland inside the alliance is good for the alliance as a whole, and I don’t foresee they will block this in the end,” said Anna Wieslander of the Atlantic Council thinktank. “But they will negotiate along the way.” After multiple warnings that Finnish and Swedish membership of Nato would have “serious consequences”, including the possible deployment of nuclear missiles in the Baltic region, Moscow appears to be downplaying the prospect. President Vladimir Putin said on Monday he saw “no immediate threat” unless Nato military infrastructure was deployed on Finnish and Swedish territory, and Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Tuesday it would make little difference as the two countries had long taken part in Nato exercises. “Nato takes their territory into account when planning military advances to the east,” Lavrov said. “So in this sense, there is probably not much difference. Let’s see how their territory is used in practice in the North Atlantic alliance.” The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said on Tuesday that all EU member states would back Finland and Sweden’s applications. “They will receive strong support, I’m sure, from all member states, because it increases our unity and it makes us stronger,” he said in Brussels. Borrell added that he hoped Nato would overcome Turkey’s objections. Germany’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, also said that while it was important that members talk “intensively” with Turkey, she was sure Ankara would be won over. “It is an improvement for Nato when two countries as strong as Sweden and Finland join,” Lambrecht said. “I am convinced Turkey will also be convinced of that.”",News/World news,Finland’s parliament approves government proposal to join Nato,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/17/finland-parliament-approve-nato-sweden-turkey
