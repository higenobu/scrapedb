1/2/2022,"The Santa Claus rally has brought the market to new highs as we enter 2022, but it’s important to remember that stocks don’t always go up in straight lines. Famed investor Jim Rogers has seen quite a few bear markets in the last half century, and he fears the biggest one yet could be right around the corner. “The next bear market will be the worst in my lifetime,” he predicted in a Q3 interview with financial advisory firm Wealthion. To be sure, Rogers has been bearish on the U.S. stock market for years. But the multimillionaire does know a thing or two about making money in turbulent times. Rogers co-founded the Quantum Fund with George Soros in 1973 — right in the middle of a devastating bear market. From then till 1980, the portfolio returned 4,200% while the S&P 500 rose 47%. Here are three assets he recommends keeping in your portfolio to ride out a possible 2022 downturn — even if you’re just sprinkling some of your extra cash on them. Rogers has long been a fan of commodities, and silver is one of his favorites. “The all-time high for silver is $50 an ounce; now it’s $23. Why can’t silver go back to its all-time high? That’s the way markets usually work,” he says. Investors love silver because it can be a store of value and a hedge against rising interest rates and inflation. At the same time, it’s widely used as an industrial metal. For instance, silver is a critical component in solar panels. So with increasing solar adoption, demand for the grey metal could get another boost. Rising prices benefit miners, so some of the easiest ways to play a looming silver boom are through companies like Wheaton Precious Metals, Pan American Silver and Coeur Mining. Unlike silver, which is trading at less than half its all-time high, copper hit new heights in 2021. But Rogers continues to like copper for a very simple reason: electric vehicles. “An electric car uses several times as much copper as a combustion engineering car, so there’s going to be huge demand for some of these metals that we didn’t have before,” he explains. “Yes, it’s at all-time highs now, but electric cars are just getting started.” As is the case with silver, investors can use copper miners to get exposure to the metal. Companies like Rio Tinto, Freeport-McMoRan and Southern Copper are well-positioned to capitalize on the copper boom. To be sure, many copper miners have already enjoyed substantial rallies in their share prices. If you’re on the fence about jumping into the metal at this point, remember you don’t have to start big. A popular trading app even allows you to buy fractions of shares with as much money as you are willing to spend. Rogers loves agricultural commodities, like sugar or corn. But this time, he’s also stressing the importance of farmland itself. “Unless we’re going to stop wearing clothes and eating food, agriculture is going to get better. If you really, really love it, go out there and get yourself a farm and you’ll get very, very, very rich,” he says. Indeed, farmland could be a great hedge because it’s intrinsically valuable and has little correlation with the ups and downs of the stock market. Over the years, agriculture has been shown to offer higher risk-adjusted returns than both stocks and real estate. The best part? You don’t need to get your hands dirty to get a piece of the action. New platforms allow you to invest in U.S. farmland by taking a stake in the farm of your choice. You’ll earn cash income from the leasing fees and crop sales. And of course, you’ll benefit from any long-term appreciation on top of that. There's one more overlooked physical asset that has little correlation with the stock market — and it might offer even bigger upside potential: fine art. Contemporary artwork has outperformed the S&P 500 by a commanding 174% over the past 25 years, according to the Citi Global Art Market chart. And it’s becoming a popular way to diversify because it’s a real physical asset with little correlation to the stock market. On a scale of -1 to +1, with 0 representing no link at all, Citi found the correlation between contemporary art and the S&P 500 was just 0.12 during the past 25 years. Investing in art by the likes of Banksy and Andy Warhol used to be an option only for the ultrarich, like Rogers. But with a new investing platform, you can invest in iconic artworks just like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates do. This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

1/2/2022,"The week before Christmas, residents of the El Portal Trailer Park got letters from Yosemite National Park saying they have to remove or surrender their homes by early 2022 because Yosemite has other plans for the trailer park and is worried about power lines there that Yosemite owns. “Thank you, Park Service,” Luke Harbin said sarcastically, shortly after heavy snowfall recently covered the mountains surrounding his mother’s home near Yosemite with a thick coat of white. Yosemite is not paying for mobile homes that residents own or moving expenses. Letters dated Dec. 13, signed by Yosemite Superintendent Cicely Muldoon, informed them for the first time that authorized tenants have to leave within 90 days. Harbin said his mother has worked in Yosemite for over 40 years and has lived in the trailer park for 38 years – 34 years in her current home. “It’s sad. Imagine losing your home after 40 years.” Harbin said while standing beside a community playground built by his father, who died a couple years ago, and other parents. The 32-year-old has fond memories of growing up in the small community for Yosemite workers, including learning to swim in a swimming hole near his family home. Tranquil El Portal, mostly populated by oak and pine trees, sits beside the Merced River and is about a five-minute drive from the west entrance of Yosemite National Park along Highway 140. Yosemite owns land in El Portal, but not many of the homes that sit upon that land. Shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic, Harbin said his mother spent at least $5,000 on a new metal roof for her double-wide mobile home that’s guaranteed for 10 years. She wouldn’t have done it had she known she’d be forced out without compensation two years later. There are around a dozen mobile homes remaining in the community, along with some other smaller trailers. Many tears have been shed there since the December letter that told residents to leave. Yosemite spokesman Scott Gediman said unauthorized tenants, including renters who aren’t supposed to be there, only have 60 days to leave. It’s unclear how many homeowners and others live there. Gediman estimated there are about 12 residents, “plus or minus.” One homeowner estimated there are at least over 20 residents who are actively working for Yosemite. Gilbert Domingues is among those who will soon be displaced. He was born in Yosemite Valley and spent most of his life living and working there. His aunt is Julia Parker – the face of Native Americans in Yosemite for many park visitors because of her longtime service at the Yosemite Museum. “I just look at it as like I’m a Native American, and the government can take my land, so they are,” Domingues said. Like the others, he’s not sure where he will go. “There’s not much I can do really except just pack up and go,” Domingues said. “The government wins again.” Trailer park residents received another letter from Yosemite’s superintendent in October, cautioning that the overhead electrical system was found to be in “very poor condition” in September and Yosemite “has contracted PG&E to fully assess the condition” – adding that “one potential outcome” might be Pacific Gas & Electric Company determining the power lines should be de-energized. “If requisite repairs are not feasible, particularly in the context of the NPS’ long-term plan for the site,” then the National Park Service would “accelerate” the relocation of residents, giving them at least 60 days notice, the letter from Muldoon continued. The letter said the site will be converted to a public and administrative-use campground for recreational vehicles, with campground construction slated to begin in 2024. Several residents interviewed for this story said the letter was the first time they were informed of the 2024 date. “We are not requesting tenants to vacate housing at this time,” the October letter reads. “This letter serves only as a notice about the conditions of the Trailer Court’s electrical distribution system.” A subsequent Dec. 13 letter, titled “NOTICE OF TERMINATION,” does tell them to go: “Based on follow up assessment of the electrical utilities and input from PG&E, park management confirmed that long-term operation of the current infrastructure is not viable. Given the safety risks of continued operation the NPS is accelerating the closure of the Trailer Court and requiring authorized tenants to vacate their sites within 90 days of this notice.” Some residents were told by others that the real reason they’re being forced to leave so quickly is because Yosemite wants to use the land as a staging area for construction equipment for various Yosemite projects starting this spring. The recent letters to residents don’t mention that, but Gediman confirmed it when asked for this story. The site being used as a construction area is ironic to some who recall residents being punished with community service for disturbing dirt in their yards and park rangers there trying to protect elderberry longhorn beetles. The area is also an archaeological site, with ancient mortar holes on boulders – circular depressions created by Native Americans while grinding food. Gediman said some major, multi-million-dollar Yosemite projects that might benefit from the trailer park being used as a construction staging area include a new planned wastewater treatment facility in El Portal, work on Glacier Point, and Tioga roads, and campground rehabilitation. “This is the administrative site,” Gediman said of El Portal. “The area is designed to meet the administrative needs of the park. Again, with our budgets coming up and a need for staging area and temporary camping for the construction workers, this is the use that we need in order to operate the park.” Yosemite recently redid power lines from Yosemite Valley to El Portal, but that didn’t include the El Portal Trailer Park. PG&E spokesman Denny Boyles said the company looked at El Portal power lines for Yosemite as a courtesy, not as a contractor. Boyles said the company isn’t sharing what it told Yosemite but that “there would never be a time where we would have any kind of authority to recommend a tenant be evicted for any reason.” A worker who inspected the lines told residents there aren’t safety issues that warrant evictions. But if the infrastructure really is that bad, “why haven’t they been maintaining them?” Harbin asked. “We’ve been paying them this whole time, for years. Why aren’t they out here doing their job?” The El Portal Trailer Park – also called the El Portal Trailer Park Village and El Portal Trailer Court – has been around since the 1950s. Homeowners of the trailer park, who have to work in Yosemite to live there, were no longer allowed to sell their homes after the flood of 1997. Annual lease agreements for the land beneath them changed to say the closure of the trailer park would “continue to be implemented through attrition.” Several residents said they understood that to mean they had to leave when they no longer worked for Yosemite. One resident said there was once 58 occupied spaces in the trailer park. There were plans to close the trailer park in 2000, but that changed in 1999. At that time, a previous Yosemite superintendent wrote, “Since the closure of the trailer village is dependent upon available funding, the January 1, 2000 closure date has been postponed. No new date for closure has been identified.” Another NPS letter in 2003 said, “this statement continues to be fact.” Several residents said Yosemite didn’t share plans for the site with them – or a new move-out deadline or construction timelines – aside from the termination letters received in December. Yosemite’s 2014 record of decision to preserve the wild and scenic Merced River – now a guiding document for park management and construction projects – talks about adding employee housing in El Portal. Within El Portal’s trailer park/adjacent Abbieville, parking and camping spaces will also be added, the plan states, while employee housing facilities there within the floodplain “will not be removed.” There’s also plenty of contradictions within the 200-page document, which, in another section, addresses removing or relocating some homes in the trailer park/Abbieville and restoring a 150-foot riparian buffer. The plan says to “remove development, asphalt and imported fill” right after noting a 300-space parking lot would be added in that area – an archaeological site. Changing and uncertain plans have left many residents unsure what to expect. Harbin said Yosemite was recently redoing sewage lines in the trailer park. Gediman said park officials communicated with residents numerous times about plans to close the trailer park through letters and community meetings and that “our intentions have been this way for almost thirty years now.” Harbin has a very different take: “They’re pulling a fast one on us.” Most who live in the trailer park now are older people who have worked in Yosemite for decades, residents said. They thought Yosemite would have given them more time to find a new place to live and move out – and not in the middle of winter. Most of the homes in the trailer park can hardly be considered “mobile” anymore. Some have been there since the 1950s and have been retrofitted with various add-ons, like covered porches and attached sheds. The chances are slim that many could be moved, even if residents have the money and want to, due to narrow sections of road past the trailer park. There’s been a one-lane bridge down the Merced River canyon since the massive Ferguson rockslide buried part of Highway 140 in 2006. Going the other direction, the road just past Yosemite’s west entrance narrows to one lane as it squeezes through an opening between boulders. For those who can’t or don’t want to move their mobile homes, Muldoon told residents that “you have the option of surrendering your trailer and/or belongings to the NPS. Recognizing that the property holds no value and is not considered a donation to NPS.” Residents recall others in the past having to cut up and discard their homes themselves before leaving the trailer park. A letter sent to residents over 20 years ago from another Yosemite superintendent said trailer park residents might be eligible for possible relocation benefits under Public Law 91-646. There was no mention of compensation in recent letters. Why not? Gediman said that the National Park Service is terminating the lease agreement, and “we’re not addressing anything beyond” that. It’s a harsh reality for those now scrambling to find new homes. “We have rights and benefits as displaced people,” Harbin said, “and they’re trying to ignore all that.” Most soon-to-be displaced residents now face either potentially renting a dorm room in Yosemite Valley or driving along the often-icy Merced River canyon to Mariposa, 40 minutes from El Portal. Housing is limited in rural Mariposa County, especially at the rate trailer park residents were paying, around $400 a month for trailer space. Some hope Yosemite will offer more time to move and said Rep. Tom McClintock’s office offered to review and endorse letters requesting time extensions. “Congressman McClintock’s office is aware of the issue,” said Jennifer Cressy, a spokesperson for McClintock, “and expects YNP to fairly consider the circumstances in each letter request for a time extension.” Two Yosemite employees and trailer park residents asked not to be identified in this story out of fear of losing employment opportunities at the park. One said they were offended by comments attributed to Gediman in a recent Mariposa Gazette story, in which the trailer park and its residents were described multiple times as “hodgepodge.” “It’s the humanity part of it.” The resident has lovingly worked on their small house for decades to make it a beloved home. Plus, “How can they do this when COVID is still going on? It’s still active. It’s still spreading.” About not getting compensated: “It’s just wrong. I know that eminent domain happens everywhere – it’s progress – but people get paid.” Even a little compensation from Yosemite would be helpful, they said. This resident recently saw similar mobile homes in Mariposa being sold for over $100,000. Residents also talked about wanting their community to look nicer. Harbin said after some previous trailers were torn out, there was trash littered across the trailer park for five years before Yosemite cleaned it up. In another instance, Harbin said he cleaned up some neighboring mess himself after Yosemite failed to do it after a couple of years. “It’s messed up. It’s not fair,” Harbin said of the state of the trailer park. “If you go over to the elementary school, it looks prestigious, and you come over here, and it looks like, literally, a dump.” Harbin said the Park Service owes trailer park residents at least some more time to leave. “It’s just not right how they went about doing all this.”",U.S./Fresno Bee,Yosemite is forcing homeowners to leave without compensation.

1/2/2022,"Dear Amy, I am a receptionist. I love my job, and my co-workers are great. There is, however, one thing that bugs me. My desk is in a common area where the mail bins are, and co-workers often chat around my desk. Some of them talk about parties they are going to, which I am not invited to. I don't expect to be invited to all the parties — some of them are ""team-building parties,"" so of course I would not be invited to other teams' gatherings. We sometimes all go out to lunch and have the occasional get-together after work, which is nice. But with the holiday season, they're talking about a party that I am not invited to, which is definitely a ""friends-from-work"" party — and not a team-building party. I think it is rude to talk about parties in front of people who are not invited. How do I ""politely"" tell them to stop talking about these gatherings in front of me? It's like I am invisible to them! I agree that it is rude to discuss a private gathering in front of someone who has not been invited. I think this is a basic rule most of us learned in elementary school and yet seem to forget later in life. Colleagues shouldn't talk about work at an office party and shouldn't talk about parties at work. Friendships form at work, and work friends have every right to enjoy their relationships and to get together outside of the office. Discussing these gatherings in front of others is a familiar complaint to supervisors and HR departments. If you have a supervisor you can talk to, you might ask them to gently remind your colleagues that your workstation is public and that they shouldn't entertain private conversations there. Depending on how well you know these co-workers, you could also handle this yourself — in a lighthearted way, by saying a version of: ""Helllooooo, I'm sitting right here."" Dear Amy, My 6-year-old granddaughter hasn't been vaccinated because the parents have opposing views, even though they are both fully vaccinated. I have calmly voiced my opinion by explaining why she needs to be vaccinated. I say ""calmly,"" but internally I'm upset and extremely worried. Are there any strategies to get the one parent to agree to vaccinate the child, or should I stay out of it? — Worried Gram In November, I published a heartbreaking account of a previous pandemic, which outlined the terrible risks of transmission of some viruses, as well as the miracle of vaccination. I'm reprinting it here: ""My mother died in 1957 in the Asian flu pandemic. I caught the virus at school (I was in kindergarten) and passed it on to her. We lived in Aurora, Ohio. My teacher didn't know there was at least one student in her classroom who passed it on to me, and perhaps other students. No one was masked. I remember being quite sick, and I remember my shock and sadness as a 5-year-old on the morning that my mother died. Catching that illness at school created deadly havoc in our home and has haunted me my whole life. I'm 69 years old now, and the loss of my mother certainly changed the lives of my sister and our father. This COVID-19 pandemic has brought back many memories, and I am a strong advocate of precautions, including masks and vaccines. Please continue to emphasize masks and vaccines in your column. Signed: Reverend Dr. Kay Palmer Marsh"" It's hard to understand why these parents would choose protection for themselves, but not their child. The good news for you — and your family -- is that you and the child's parents are vaccinated (and hopefully boosted) and are thus protected from the worst outcome of the disease, should your granddaughter carry the virus home. However, you have already made your case to them. Stay calm, try not to worry, and if they bring this up, urge them to follow the advice of their child's pediatrician and the CDC. Dear Amy, Responding to the heartbreaking letter from ""Gutted in Illinois,"" who had just gone through an extremely traumatic birth, only to have her mother-in-law refuse to help, you didn't suggest that her husband should step up. I would encourage anyone else in the situation to call on family members/husband to assist with confrontations AND housework! — Been There ""Gutted"" didn't mention a husband, and I was left wondering if he was on the scene.

1/2/2022,"It was just two hours before sunset on Jan. 15, 2017 when a 911 operator in Greene County, Ohio got a call about an injured woman lying at the edge of a driveway in Yellow Springs, about 15 miles outside Dayton. ""I can see blood coming out of the side of her head,"" the caller said. ""It does not look like she’s breathing."" The Greene County Sheriff's Office responded shortly after that 3:30 p.m. call and could see that the victim, later determined to be Sherri Mendenhall, 63, was already gone. ""There is a lot of blood,"" Greene County Detective Warren Hensley told ""Killer Siblings, airing Fridays at 8/7c on Oxygen. ""She’s got an obvious head wound."" The driveway in which she was found led to a side-by-side duplex apartment over a carport and small art gallery. When law enforcement went up the stairs to the apartment level, they could see that the door to the right-hand apartment was open. ""They went in in an effort to clear the apartment,"" Greene County Detective Kelly Edwards said, ""to make sure there wasn’t an active shooter or somebody else needing assistance."" Instead, the police found the body of a man in the back bedroom, later determined to be William ""Skip"" Brown, 44. He had been shot several times. They called for back-up, and by the time agents from the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation arrived, it was already starting to get dark. They started with Mendenhall's body, and noticed something right away. ""Her head was facing towards the road away from the house,"" Ohio BCI Senior Special Agent Seth Hagaman told ""Killer Siblings."" ""It suggested that she was trying to get away from the house when she was shot."" Brown was lying near the foot of his bed with multiple gunshot wounds; investigators noticed a spent shotgun shell in the hall outside the bedroom, and three .9mm bullet casings on the floor of the bedroom — one of which turned out to have unknown male DNA on it. Shotgun pellets had hit the headboard, mattress, and floor; there was blood spatter on the walls and into the closet just beyond the foot of the bed. He had four gunshot wounds to the chest; the coroner eventually determined that two were from a shotgun and two were from the .9mm. Mendenhall's apartment, though, was completely undisturbed, as was the art gallery that Brown maintained on the first floor of the building, which was mostly dedicated to the work of his grandfather, the photographer Axel Bahnsen. (Brown was also an amateur photographer himself, though he made his living through the roofing business he owned.) But because of the art gallery and some reported thefts on the property, Brown had installed an extensive camera system. On it, investigators were able to see video of the moment Sherri Mendenhall was killed. ""On the surveillance footage, shortly after 3 in the morning the night before, we see Sherri Mendenhall running,"" Edwards explained. ""She ran out to the left towards the street. She gets just under the streetlight when we see her fall ... then a male comes into view. He’s heading down the stairs from the apartments and he goes to the left towards the road."" The man was described as a tall, thin, white man carrying a black pistol — but his face wasn't visible because the cameras were in night mode. It was the only evidence of the perpetrators on the video system, indicating to investigators that whomever had orchestrated the murders knew about the system. Investigators were able to determine one more thing from the video of Mendenhall's murder: The shot that killed her had to have come from the roof of the carport — 25 yards away from where she fell, and 10 to 12 feet above the ground outside the doors to the two apartments.      ""It was one shot fired and killed her possibly instantly,"" Ohio BCI Special Agent David Hornyak said. ""It seemed like a heckuva shot."" Given the viciousness of the 3:00 a.m. attack on Skip Brown, investigators decided he must have been the intended target, and began looking into current and former employees and associates of his roofing business. Among those former employees was Brown's step-nephew, Dustin Merrick, 25. Another contractor told investigators that Brown had referred to Dustin as his ""right hand man"" and indicated that he was integral to the business — which is why he was surprised that Dustin was no longer working there. Investigators learned that Brown had hired Dustin to help ""him get back on his feet"" after some troubles, but had to fire him in the fall before the murders. ""Dustin believed that Skip owed him about $400 for back pay at the time that he was fired,"" said Edwards. In an initial interview Hornyak and Edwards conducted with Dustin on Jan. 20, 2017, he indicated that his younger brother, Bret Merrick, 24, had been at his place the night of the murders and stayed over after the two had been painting that night. He said Brown had fired him for asking for more standard 9-5 hours, but that was ""kinda the way he was."" Dustin provided a DNA sample upon request for ""elimination purposes"" and, when questioned about some National Rifle Association certificates on display in the home, admitted that he had a concealed carry permit for a .9mm handgun and also owned a .22 caliber rifle and a ""Chinese birdshot gun"" (a shotgun of Chinese manufacture). Dustin volunteered to let investigators remove the shotgun for analysis and allowed Hornyak to examine the .9mm handgun, the magazine of which held 12 rounds; fully loaded, with a bullet in the chamber, the gun normally held 13 rounds. But when Hornyak cleared the weapon, there were only nine bullets in it — four shy of full. Hornyak and Edwards both realized that, since there were 4 spent .9mm casings at the scene, they might be holding the murder weapon. On Jan. 23, the crime lab confirmed that the DNA found on one of the .9mm casings in Brown's bedroom belonged to Dustin and, the next day, confirmed that the .9mm gun they'd seized was one of the guns that had shot Brown and the gun that had killed Mendenhall. Since Bret was his brother's only alibi and the brothers were known to be close, investigators suspected that it was Bret on the surveillance video from the crime scene — especially since he was taller and thinner than his older brother. So, on Jan. 24, 2017 — less than 10 days after the murder — a Greene County Sheriffs Office SWAT team arrested Dustin Merrick while Hagaman and another detective asked Bret Merrick to come into the Xenia Police Department for a voluntary interview. Hagaman had what he termed a ""relaxed conversation"" about Skip Brown — until Hagaman told Bret that his brother has been arrested in the murder. At that point, Edwards and Hornyak took over the interview and Edwards lied to Bret, trying to convince him that Dustin had told police that Bret had been the main shooter at Skip Brown's house the night of the murders. Though he initially didn't believe it, Edwards was so convincing that Dustin had implicated Bret that the latter folded, telling Edwards and Hornyak, ""F--k that guy."" He then gave police a confession. According to Bret, he did go over to Dustin's house around 9:00 p.m. on Jan. 14 to paint — but his brother was already drunk when he arrived. They painted and drank until well past midnight, when Bret heard the door open and close and went outside to see Dustin getting into his car. ""He’s just talking about work: 'Got to get this done, it’s very important,'"" Bret told Edwards and Hornyak. ""I knew he was angry…. I thought he was going to threaten Skip."" Bret said he got into the car with his brother, ""because I didn’t know if I could help him. I didn’t know if I could keep him out of trouble."" But when they parked well behind Brown's house, Dusti went into his truck and got out a gun. ""Dustin had the shotgun on his back,"" he added. ""That’s when I went up to him and I’m like, ‘What the fuck is going on?’ He had a .9mm ... I had a .40 cal. Dustin gave me that .40 cal. He handed me the gun because Dustin was on a mission. I took his handgun. I had the gun to make sure nobody shot him."" The two men climbed onto the roof of the carport to avoid Skip Brown's security cameras and entered his unlocked apartment. Bret said he hid in the kitchen behind a wall to protect his brother and watched Dustin advance on Skip Brown's bedroom before hearing gunshots. ""And then I heard a woman,"" Bret said. ""She was saying, 'What’s going on? What’s going on?'"" Bret claimed he then fired into the door to scare Sheri Mendenhall, who ran down the stairs towards the street. Dustin, he said, emerged from the bedroom and gave chase. ""Dustin takes the pistol, and shoots it, and she falls,"" he said. ""He was afraid that she knew who he was."" After his confession, Bret Merrick was arrested for the murders of Sherri Mendenhall and Skip Brown and investigators conducted a warranted search of his place, where they recovered his cell phone. On it, recorded shortly after the murders, was Bret Merrick sing-rapping. ""I always talk a big game but I really never thought I could do it,"" he half-croons in the recording. ""When it comes time to prove it, it turns out I really overdo it."" “Very crazy,"" explained Edwards. ""Bret had made a song singing about the homicides. You can’t do this and not have some evil in you."" Dustin was eventually charged with counts of aggravated murder, while Brett was charged with two counts of complicity to aggravated murder, complicity to aggravated burglary, and felonious assault. Both were charged with tampering with evidence and obstruction of justice. The two brothers were facing the death penalty but, in Sept. 2018, took plea deals. Dustin Merrick, smiling, pleaded guilty to two counts of aggravated murder, two counts of aggravated burglary, one count of felony tampering with evidence, and one count of felony obstruction of justice. He was was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for the murders, with a concurrent 11-year sentence on the burglary charges and three years for each of the other charges. Bret Merrick pleaded guilty to two counts of involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to 25 years. He is not eligible for parole until 2042 — which is also when his sentence ends.
