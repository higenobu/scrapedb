12/25/2021,"There are more than 300 species of octopus. They are mollusks and being invertebrates, they possess no bones. They are masters of shape shifting, able to fit their entire bodies through spaces barely larger than their eyes. They can elongate for better propulsion, spread out like a parachute to capture prey, and extend their arms into the tiniest of crevices too explore for food. One of the most intelligent creatures in the animal kingdom, they are capable of observational learning and they possess short and long term memories. This octopus is hunting during the day, which is a rare sight. Generally nocturnal feeders, they hide during daylight hours and emerge when darkness envelops the reef. They feed on crabs, fish, and other mollusks, groping around and under coral to capture a meal. Able to control all eight arms independently, their brains are sophisticated and highly efficient. They are even able to smell and taste with their tentacles which is of great benefit when using their arms to find food. When an octopus captures crabs or shelled mollusks, they may be strong enough to tear them apart, but for those with seemingly impenetrable shells, the octopus has an impressive method of overcoming the armour. Minute teeth are used to drill a hole in the shell. With the help of an enzyme in the octopus’ saliva they can dissolve calcium carbonate in the shells. After creating a tiny hole in the exoskeletons, the octopus injects a toxin that will kill the animal, causing the muscles to relax so that the shells can be opened. The octopus has two thirds of its neurons located in complex nerve systems in its arms. They are capable of complex reflex actions that do not require input from the brain. This makes the octopus a powerful, flexible, and formidable predator. The octopus must be wary of sharks, eels, sea lions and other large predators. It is agile and quick in the water for short distances, using jet propulsion for locomotion. It can also expel ink, making it difficult for a predator to see or smell the octopus. Able to conceal itself in small spaces, it is well protected. In the open, it is the master of camouflage and shape shifting, able to disguise itself well against almost any background. There are few predators in the ocean with skills and abilities that rival those of the octopus. It is truly a super predator.",Science/Rumble,Octopus hunting is truly a super predator on the reef,https://news.yahoo.com/octopus-hunting-truly-super-predator-133003149.html
12/25/2021,"WORCESTER — The parents of a Worcester-raised actor were found dead inside their Tatnuck home Monday night after she called a relative to check on them. Alicia Witt, a singer/songwriter, actress and author, said in a written statement that she had not heard back from her parents, Robert and Diane Witt, for several days. ""I reached out to a cousin who lives close to my parents to check on them. Sadly, the outcome was unimaginable,"" she wrote. ""I ask for some privacy at this time to grieve and to wrap my head around this turn of events, and this surreal loss."" The deaths of the couple, found inside their Sussex Lane home Monday night, are not suspicious but the cause of their demise is a mystery, police said. Police were called to the home shortly after 9 p.m. by a family member who requested assistance in checking on the couple, Worcester police said. Once inside the home, the officers found the couple deceased. There were no obvious signs of a cause of death, police said. ""There was no trauma,"" Lt. Sean Murtha said. Police listed Diane Witt as being 75 and Robert Witt as 87. There were reports that the couple had been experiencing furnace problems and were using a space heater, police said. Firefighters were summoned and checked the air quality inside the home but found that no noxious gases were present, Worcester Fire Deputy Chief Adam Roche said. ""There were no signs of carbon monoxide,"" Roche said. A neighbor said the couple were rarely seen outside the home and that she believed they had been ill for sometime. She said many neighbors had offered them help as their home fell into disrepair, but they politely refused. One neighbor had been mowing the lawn and clearing snow from the property for a few years, she said. Police said the state medical examiner will perform autopsies to determine a cause of death. The couple have two children, Ian Witt and Alicia Witt. She recently released a new album and published a book. Her career has included recent roles in “Orange Is the New Black,” “Nashville,” “Twin Peaks” and “Twin Peaks: The Return,” “The Walking Dead,” ""Two Weeks Notice,"" ""88 Minutes"" and “Mr. Holland’s Opus.” Diane Witt was a celebrity in her own right in the1980s when her hair, which was more than 10 feet long, earned her a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records. Reports from that time indicate that her husband and children helped her maintain her tresses, which she wore braided and piled atop her head. Diane Witt home-schooled the couple's children and Robert was a science teacher at Burncoat Middle School. Craig S. Semon of the Telegram & Gazette staff contributed to this report.

12/25/2021,"ROME (AP) — Pope Francis urged Vatican cardinals, bishops and bureaucrats Thursday to embrace humility this Christmas season, saying their pride, self-interest and the “glitter of our armor” was perverting their spiritual lives and corrupting the church’s mission. As he has in the past, Francis used his annual Christmas address to take Vatican administrators to task for their perceived moral and personal failings, denouncing in particular those pride-filled clerics who “rigidly” hide behind Catholic Church traditions rather than seek out the neediest with humility. As they have in the past, cardinals and bishops sat stone-faced as they listened to Francis lecture them in the Hall of Blessings, which was otherwise decked out in jolly twinkling Christmas trees and poinsettias. “The humble are those who are concerned not simply with the past but also with the future, since they know how to look ahead, to spread their branches, remembering the past with gratitude,"" Francis told them. “The proud, on the other hand, simply repeat, grow rigid and enclose themselves in that repetition, feeling certain about what they know and fearful of anything new because they cannot control it."" The proud who are so inward-looking are consumed with their own interests, the pontiff said. “As a consequence, they neither learn from their sins nor are they genuinely open to forgiveness. This is a tremendous corruption disguised as a good. We need to avoid it,"" he added. Since becoming pope in 2013, Francis has used his Christmas address to rail against the Curia, as the Holy See's bureaucracy is known, denouncing the “spiritual Alzheimer’s” that some members suffer and the resistance he had encountered to his efforts to reform and revitalize the institution and the broader Catholic Church. Those reforms kicked into high gear this year, and some of the top Catholic hierarchy bore the brunt as Francis ordered a 10% pay cut for cardinals, imposed a 40-euro ($45) gift cap for Holy See personnel and passed a law allowing cardinals and bishops to be criminally prosecuted by the Vatican’s own tribunal. On top of that, Francis added his Christmas greetings in the form of another public brow-beating of Vatican clerics, who normally are treated with the utmost deference by their underling and the faithful at large. Francis told them to stop hiding behind the “armor” of their titles and to recognize that they, like the Biblical figure of Naaman, a wealthy and decorated general, were lepers in need of healing. “The story of Naaman reminds us that Christmas is the time when each of us needs to find the courage to take off our armor, discard the trappings of our roles, our social recognition and the glitter of this world and adopt the humility of Naaman,” he said. Francis also repeated his call for tradition-minded clerics to stop living in the past, saying their obsession with old doctrine and liturgy concealed a “spiritual worldliness” that was corrupting. “Seeking those kinds of reassurance is the most perverse fruit of spiritual worldliness, for it reveals a lack of faith, hope and love; it leads to an inability to discern the truth of things,” he said. Francis this year took his biggest step yet to rein in the traditionalist wing of the church, reimposing restrictions on celebrating the old Latin Mass that Pope Benedict XVI had relaxed in 2007. He intensified those restrictions last weekend with a new set of rules that forbids even the publication of Tridentine Mass times in parish bulletins. Francis said the proud who remain stuck in the past, “enclosed in their little world, have neither past nor future, roots or branches, and live with the bitter taste of a melancholy that weighs on their hearts as the most precious of the devil’s potions.” “All of us are called to humility, because all of us are called to remember and to give life. We are called to find a right relationship with our roots and our branches. Without those two things, we become sick, destined to disappear,” he warned.",World/Associated Press,Pope demands humility in new zinger-filled Christmas speech,https://news.yahoo.com/pope-demands-humility-zinger-filled-104146318.html
