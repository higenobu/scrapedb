3/31/2022,"The air pollution from wood burning in homes is responsible for more than £1bn a year in health-related damages in the UK and €10bn (£8.5bn) across the EU, according to a report. The analysis from the European Public Health Alliance found the total costs of early deaths, illness and lost work resulting from outdoor air pollution produced by all home heating was €29bn a year. Wood burning was the biggest single cause of these costs, accounting for 54% of the total in the UK and 40% in the EU. This is despite wood stoves producing only 11% of heat in UK homes and 14% in the EU. The report combines burning wood in stoves and on open fires: in the UK two-thirds of people use stoves. The researchers said their cost estimates were conservative because lack of data prevented them from including the impact of indoor air pollution from heating. Compared with transport, regulators have largely neglected heating and cooking as sources of air pollution, the EPHA said. The report found that heat pumps and solar water heaters produced no air pollution at homes using them. “It is clearer than ever that burning biomass and fossil fuels at home is not only an environmental problem, but also a major health problem,” said Milka Sokolović, the EPHA director general. “The solution, obviously, lies in ensuring that homes are powered by clean renewables. As people are grappling with high energy prices, we must avoid quick and dirty solutions.” Air pollution is the single biggest environmental risk to health, causing millions of early deaths a year globally. In the EU, just one of pollutants, small particles under 2.5 microns in size (PM2.5), is blamed for 300,000 deaths a year. A comprehensive global review in 2019 found that air pollution may be damaging every organ in the human body. Recent reports have highlighted the high levels of pollution produced by wood burners. The stoves emit more particles than traffic in the UK, where only 8% of homes have them and 95% of stove owners have other sources of heating. Wood burning stoves in urban areas are also responsible for almost half of people’s exposure to the cancer-causing chemicals found in dirty air, another study concluded. The new report was produced for EPHA by the Dutch consultancy CE Delft. The health-related social costs were derived using data from Eurostat and other sources on fuel emissions, energy use and links to disease for seven pollutants. These costs included premature death, illness, greater healthcare spending and lower productivity. The data was from 2018, the latest available. The analysis found that for most countries – 18 out of 28 – the health-related social costs due to people heating their homes were higher than the costs due to their use of cars and other transport. The most damaging type of heating were coal boilers, which resulted in €1,200 of damages a year and these accounted for 64% of the total costs in Poland. Wood stoves were the second most damaging, with average costs of €750 a year, causing 84% of costs in Italy. “For comparison, we roughly estimated that driving a diesel car for one year causes health-related social costs of €210,” the researchers wrote. In the UK, the health-related social costs of wood stoves is about 40 times higher than a gas boiler over a year. “Obviously, when some [fuels and appliances] are very polluting, they have a high share of the social cost estimates, but only a relatively minor share of the final energy consumption,” said environmental economist Marisa Korteland at CE Delft. The EU is set to tighten air pollution limits in 2022 and may tighten Ecodesign pollution limits for heaters. The latest Ecodesign wood stoves, which become mandatory in January for new sales in the EU and UK, emit 750 times more tiny particle pollution than a modern HGV truck, an October report showed. Earlier in March, the UK government proposed new air quality limits for 2040 that would allow twice as much PM2.5 pollution in England as the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends as an upper limit today.",News/Environment,"Home wood burning in UK causes £1bn of health costs a year, report says",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/30/home-wood-burning-in-uk-causes-1bn-of-health-costs-a-year-report-says
3/31/2022,"Poetry is already dominating Australia’s Stella prize in its first year of being eligible, with three collections among the six shortlisted books up for the $50,000 literary award for women and non-binary writers. On a shortlist whittled down from 220 entries, Noongar and Yawuru poet Elfie Shiosaki has made it for her first collection Homecoming, which explores colonialisation and assimilation across four generations of women in her family. Philippines-born poet Eunice Andrada is nominated for TAKE CARE, a collection that examines sexual violence and colonial conquest. And Evelyn Araluen, a descendant of the Bundjalung nation, is listed for her debut collection, Dropbear; in his review for the Guardian, critic Declan Fry – also a judge on this year’s Stella prize – wrote that it “repurposes Biblical themes, Australiana kitsch and settler-colonial tropes to astonishing effect”. “It was incredible. It is the first year poetry has been eligible and we didn’t expect so many entries. We found ourselves surprised and delighted by how strong they were – there was a freshness, a newness in the poetry we saw,” said author and Stella judge Sisonke Msimang. “I think we’re seeing a coming of age of a really diverse array of voices in Australian literature, and you see that very clearly in poetry right now. This is poetry’s moment, and it just affirms why the Stella has added it.” Thirty-five of the 220 books submitted for the prize in 2022 were poetry collections. Also up for the award are Anwen Crawford’s No Document, a formally experimental book-length essay about grief and art; and Stone Fruit by Lee Lai, a debut graphic novel that follows two queer women in the aftermath of their break up. Just one novel is up for the prize this year: Bodies of Light by Jennifer Down, which follows a young girl, Maggie, through child abuse, foster homes and institutionalisation, and into late-middle age. Melissa Lucashenko, chair of the judging panel and former winner of the prize, said that this year’s shortlist is “big on emerging voices writing in unconventional ways – from regions, positions, and literary forms that transcend the mainstream. “These authors are writing back, insisting that ‘other’ lives – First Nations lives, poor women’s lives, queer lives, and Filipina lives – matter on the page just as they do in everyday affairs,” she said. She said the shortlisted authors share two things: “First, all six shortlistees undertake the essential work of any artist: paying attention to what is happening around them, and interrogating that experience. Second, the authors have produced powerfully beautiful literature, sacrificing no art in their unflinching focus on justice, inclusion, and truth-telling.” Extending eligibility to poetry is not the only change to the Stella prize in recent years, with the award also opening to trans women and non-binary writers in 2020. Stone Fruit author Lai is just the second non-binary writer to have been nominated for the Stella, making the shortlist a year after the first, SL Lim. Joining Lucashenko on the judging panel this year are Fry, authors Cate Kennedy and Sisonke Msimang, and essayist and screenwriter Oliver Reeson. Each of the shortlisted authors received $4,000. The winner will be announced on 28 April.

3/31/2022,"Liz Truss, Britain’s foreign secretary, is due to land in India on Thursday to urge Narendra Modi’s government to reduce its strategic dependency on Russia. But her arrival in New Delhi coincides with that of her sparring partner Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, who also arrives in India for his first visit since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. India has been criticised by western powers for not taking a tough enough line against the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the UK hopes for clear signals from Modi’s government about its opposition to the invasion and support for the UN charter. Joe Biden, the US president, described the Indian position recently as “shaky”. Truss will sign a joint strategic cyber partnership with India and sees this as a sign of the two countries’ willingness to increase security cooperation. India is heavily dependent on Russia for arms purchases, and Lavrov is reportedly keen to persuade India to increase its purchase of discounted Russian oil. The discussions with Lavrov could also feature formulating a rupee-ruble payment mechanism for bilateral trade between India and Russia, a means of evading US sanctions. As part of what is being billed as a diplomatic push against Russia, Truss will meet with India’s external affairs minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar. She is due to stress that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “underlines the importance of democracies working closer together to deter aggressors, reduce vulnerability to coercion and strengthen global security”. India, highlighting its non-aligned status, abstained at the UN general assembly in a key vote condemning the Russian invasion. The Foreign Office said Truss wants progress in talks to develop defence-related trade, including innovative security technology, strengthening defence ties with the world’s largest democracy. Before her arrival, Truss said: “Deeper ties between Britain and India will boost security in the Indo-Pacific and globally, and create jobs and opportunities in both countries. “This matters even more in the context of Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and underlines the need for free democracies to work closer together in areas like defence, trade and cybersecurity. “India is an economic and tech powerhouse, the world’s largest democracy and a great friend of Britain, and I want to build an even closer relationship between our two nations.” The UK and India will also agree to closer maritime cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. The UK will join India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative and become a lead partner on maritime security issues, coordinating work with key partners in south-east Asia. Strengthening ties with India has been a priority for Truss since taking up the role. The visit is her second as foreign secretary and her third as a secretary of state in 13 months: she also visited as trade secretary. She will argue that the current volatility in oil and gas prices and energy security concerns, as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, shows the need not to buy more Russia oil but instead the importance of India’s green transition and moves towards energy self-sufficiency that UK technology can hasten.",News/Politics,Liz Truss’s India visit made awkward by presence of Russian counterpart,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/30/liz-truss-india-visit-narendra-modi-russia-sergei-lavrov
3/31/2022,"Gareth Southgate has emphasised that Harry Maguire retains his full support but knows he cannot give the beleaguered defender any guarantees over a starting place in his England team at the World Cup later this year. Maguire had hoped the international break would offer him the chance to reset after his torrid period at Manchester United. During the 29-year-old’s last game for United, the Champions League last-16 exit at home to Atlético Madrid, the Old Trafford crowd cheered his withdrawal six minutes from time. However, when Southgate started him in England’s second game of the break – the 3-0 win over Ivory Coast on Tuesday – home supporters booed when Maguire’s name was announced before kick-off. There were further boos when he took his first touches. Maguire has excelled for England under Southgate, playing a key role in the runs to the 2018 World Cup semi-final and the Euro 2020 final. There is the feeling in some quarters that his credit in the bank is so extensive that he is certain to start at the World Cup in Qatar, which kicks off in late November, especially as Southgate’s experienced options in central defence do not run particularly deep. The manager, though, made it clear that was not the case. “I’m not going to give any of them that because they’ve got competition for places,” Southgate said. “This week, we’ve seen Marc Guéhi and Ben White play extremely well. I think Tyrone Mings’s record of clean sheets with England is outstanding. We weren’t able to get John Stones on the pitch [because of injury]. “Yes, Harry has been in our No 1 pairing through those tournaments and has my full backing and support. But equally I’m not going to say to anybody in the middle of March that they are a guaranteed starter in the World Cup team. That’s not the environment I’m looking to create and not the competition we are going to need.” Though Southgate is looking forward to Friday’s World Cup draw in Doha, when England will be in the top pot of seeds, the shockwaves from Maguire’s treatment by the fans continue to reverberate and the manager is painfully aware the incident threatens to destroy one of the foundation stones of his tenure. He has been able to rebuild the connection between the team and the support, and players want to report for international duty these days, which was not always the case in the past. However, Southgate warned after the Ivory Coast game that there could be a regression in the relationship. “Don’t think for one minute the other players are not looking at that and thinking: ‘That could be me one day,’” Southgate said. “That has been one of the problems of playing for England.” He did not pull his punches at Wembley, calling the booing of Maguire an “absolute joke” and questioning what had gone through the minds of those who had done it – if anything. “I would imagine if you were to ask people why they were doing that they wouldn’t be able to answer,” he said. “It becomes a mob mentality.” It is rare to hear a manager criticising the fans of his own team, although Southgate was quick to absolve the proper supporters of any blame; the “hardcore”, as he called them, who were “trying to get Maguire’s name sung”. Yet if Southgate’s comments came from a position of strength, they also betrayed the depth of his anger.",Sport/Football,Gareth Southgate offers Harry Maguire ‘full backing’ but no guarantee of starts,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/30/gareth-southgate-harry-maguire-england-world-cup
3/31/2022,"Labour will launch its local elections battle with the slogan “On your side”, urging voters to send the Conservatives a message about the pain of the cost of living crisis and No 10 lockdown breaches. Keir Starmer will launch the party’s campaign in Bury, a symbolic location where one local MP, Christian Wakeford, defected from the Tories to Labour over Boris Johnson’s behaviour during the Partygate investigation. Though the launch will focus entirely on the high prices of bills and the tax burden, Labour sources said the slogan was also intended to evoke the feeling of “one rule for them” that the public had expressed during the exposés of lockdown breaches. The party will launch its campaign with new analysis claiming families will be £2,620 worse off, even despite the additional measures in Rishi Sunak’s spring statement to cut fuel duty and raise the threshold for paying national insurance. Starmer will point to the rise in energy bills as well as the national insurance rise, and say Labour would cut people’s energy bills by up to £600 – funded by a windfall levy on the excess profits of the oil and gas companies. Other campaigns will be launched in Worthing, a south coast town represented by two Conservative MPs where Labour hope to take the council, and Derby, a Midlands bellwether where Conservatives control the council. “In exactly five weeks, you get the chance to send the Tories a message they cannot ignore. A message that Britain deserves better than the pathetic response we got to the Conservative cost of living crisis in the mini-budget,” Starmer will say. “You know the reality – prices are going through the roof, and wages are going through the floor. A Conservative government that takes far more than it gives to working people. The biggest drop in living standards since the 50s. Taxes the highest in 70 years. “Even allowing for everything the chancellor announced, families are £2,620 worse off. Britain deserves better than this.” Starmer will say that British people do “not have a government on the side of businesses, working families and pensioners.”. Labour will pledge to reform employment law to outlaw behaviour that led to the sackings of 800 P&O workers, as well as promising tougher action on crime with police hubs in every neighbourhood. The party is facing a tough test in the elections with pressure to capitalise on the Tories’ Partygate difficulties. Labour’s poll lead has dropped from an average of eight to four points. The Conservatives are also quietly hopeful of some new victories, including in the totemic Sunderland council, which would be a blow to Labour’s chances of recovering in the red wall.",News/Politics,Labour to launch ‘on your side’ local elections battle,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/30/labour-to-launch-on-your-side-local-elections-battle
