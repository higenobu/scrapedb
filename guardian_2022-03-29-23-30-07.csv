3/29/2022,"Now that the Metropolitan police have issued 20 fines to government officials for violating the Covid rules they were tasked with drawing up, there are two things we can conclude about Boris Johnson. Either, when he declared less than four months ago that “all the guidelines were observed”, he was completely ignorant about the laws he was directly responsible for – or he repeatedly and shamelessly lied. There is a third possibility – he had no idea what was going on in the prime minister’s official residence – that is too insulting to anyone’s intelligence to even bother indulging. Which of the two options is true is interesting as an academic debate, but both provide the same answer to the basic question: “Regardless of your political standpoint, is this person fit for high office?” Let’s indulge it anyway. Johnson is, notoriously, not known as a details man. If the phrase “educated beyond his intelligence” could sprout arms, legs and a contrived untidy mop, it would be him. Oxbridge does not, unfortunately, lack his type: mediocre youngsters ensconced in privilege, whose pretentious vocabulary and unnecessary use of Latin disguises a lack of depth and knowledge. As foreign secretary, his civil servants privately briefed that he had “the attention span of a gnat”, and that submissions to him “needed to be short, and they needed to be clear about what he was being asked to do”. His public statement that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was training journalists in Iran, rather than visiting relatives on holiday, was one example of how his lack of attention to details produces dreadful real-world consequences. That Johnson reportedly leaves top-secret papers strewn across a flat that he shares with his wife, Carrie – who is known to be close friends with British journalists who visit their residence – shows that he is a fundamentally unserious, lazy man who thinks consequences are for other people. It is so clearly a matter of public record that the prime minister is a liar that the very act of claiming he is not a liar is itself a deception: he was, after all, sacked twice, as journalist and politician, for not telling the truth. His former employee the journalist Peter Oborne compiled an entire book, The Assault on Truth, dedicated to documenting his lies, but there wasn’t enough space to include them all so he set up a sprawling website to finish the task. The only leeway that could be given is that men so pathologically obsessed with lying lose their grasp of the difference between fact and fiction, and so can lie without even being conscious of it. The likely conclusion, therefore, is that Johnson is both a liar and someone who cannot absorb very clear and basic information, unlike the millions of ordinary people who fully understood and complied with laws that he was ultimately responsible for designing and communicating. You wouldn’t trust a man with this combination of qualities with the most rudimentary responsibilities – and yet he is running your entire country. As Vladimir Putin’s forces continue to unleash barbarism on the people of Ukraine, the prime minister’s acolytes’ argument will be tediously predictable. Does the war not put a few boozy gatherings in No 10 in perspective? Must we obsess over such trivialities while children are being slaughtered? Don’t fall for it: moral clarity demands that the horror in Ukraine must not be used to smother objections to the corruption of our democracy, which is what this is. Yes, Johnson’s team believe that Putin’s tanks have rescued their man, and they can wave polling statistics that suggest their Teflon-coated conman has crawled from the electoral abyss. Labour’s consistent failure to offer an inspiring alternative, relying instead on their opponents’ fetish for self-immolation to win by default, has certainly helped the Tories. But this really does matter. It’s not just that so many citizens could not hold the hands of dying loved ones, or endured crippling extended loneliness, and therefore feel righteous fury at their rulers. It’s that if our government gets away with rampantly disobeying laws that were used to victimise the powerless – including arresting homeless people and fining children – then they will, rightly, believe that they can get away with other abuses of power. Many understood that “one rule for them, another rule for us” was a key guiding principle in British society, but it has now been erected in big, flashing neon lights over the heart of government.

3/29/2022,"The House committee investigating the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol is reportedly looking at a “possible coverup” of White House records focusing on Donald Trump’s phone logs from that fateful day, which bear an unexplained gap of seven hours and 37 minutes covering the period when the violence was unfolding. Documents obtained by the Washington Post and CBS News put flesh on the bones of one of the great mysteries of January 6: why White House phone logs contain holes in the record despite evidence that the then president busily made calls at the height of the insurrection. The documents reveal that Trump’s daily diary shows an entry at 11.17am when he “talked on a phone call to an unidentified person”. The next entry is not until 6.54pm – 457 minutes later – when he asked the White House switchboard to place a call to his communications chief Dan Scavino. Between those times Trump addressed a rally on the Ellipse, exhorting his supporters to “fight like hell”; hundreds of Trump followers and white supremacists overran police barricades and stormed the Capitol building; and Mike Pence, the vice president, who had been overseeing the certification of Joe Biden’s victory in the presidential election, was forced to go into hiding. Seven people died as a result of the attack and more than 100 law enforcement officers were injured. In an echo of history, the investigation by the January 6 committee of a possible coverup was revealed by the famous Watergate reporter, the Washington Post’s Bob Woodward. His journalistic partner on this occasion was Robert Acosta. The duo reported that the long gap between call logs was of “intense interest” to elements of the committee. They quoted an unnamed member of the committee who said they were investigating a “possible coverup”. The J6 committee consists of nine members, seven of whom are Democrats and two – Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois – are Republicans who are participating in the probe in defiance of their party’s leadership. According to Woodward and Acosta, the committee is looking at possible ways in which Trump skirted around normal accountability governing telephone calls for a sitting president. One theory is that he might have used disposable or “burner phones”. In a statement to the news outlets, Trump dismissed such speculation. “I have no idea what a burner phone is, to the best of my knowledge I have never even heard the term,” he said. The disclosure of evidence around the events of January 6 has been a bone of contention between Trump and the committee for months. Last month the National Archives disclosed that it had found boxes of classified documents that the former president had improperly taken away from the White House. The phone logs containing the six-hour interlude were only handed over to the committee earlier this year after the US supreme court rejected a call by Trump to block the transfer of the documents. Pressure on the former president over his actions on January 6 comes at an intense moment for him. Earlier this month the committee laid out a case for Trump having violated several federal laws in his attempt to overturn the 2020 election results and stay in power. This week a federal judge also stated that Trump appeared to have committed multiple felonies in his pursuit of the “big lie” that the election was stolen from him. That ruling came as Judge David Carter ordered John Eastman, the conservative lawyer who advised Trump on how to delay certification of Biden’s victory, to hand over hundreds of emails to the J6 committee.",News/US news,Records show long gap in Trump phone logs as January 6 violence unfolded,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/29/trump-phone-logs-capitol-attack-january-6
3/29/2022,"There were no giant cruise ships in 18th-century Venice. No Disney store by the Rialto, no Biennale. Instead, a handful of aristocrats, off on their grand tour, took leisurely gondola trips on quiet canals. And instead of taking home a mask and a bottle of grappa, they got a painter called Canaletto to do them a few views. One visitor, Lord John Russell, commissioned no fewer than 24 such souvenirs and they are on view at the National Maritime Museum while their usual home, Woburn Abbey in Bedfordshire, is being restored. They are undeniably gorgeous. But the museum tries to hang too large a narrative arc on what is basically a nice chance to see some stately home treasures. No, they insist – this is a chilling insight into the peril facing Venice today, when flooding caused by the climate crisis and egregious levels of mass tourism threaten to destroy this precious human ecosystem. The show ends with a salutary video of the city’s recent floods and a powerful interactive tool that lets you see, from year to year, how the worst flooding in Venice’s history has hit in just the last few years. There used to be many years with no floods at all. Canaletto’s views don’t much benefit from all this information. I was gripped by the drama of the floods on screen, though, shamefully spellbound by the spectacle of people wading through St Mark’s Square up to their hips in water. Such apocalyptic visions are important and we need to see them, but it does no favours to the placid, precise paintings of the Venetian master. They make Canaletto’s golden views look boringly picturesque. It reminded me of that bit in Spiderman: Far from Home when Peter Parker’s school trip to see Venice and all its sublime architecture is suddenly enlivened by a monster destroying the Rialto Bridge. This is unfair on Canaletto because he is not some cliched artist of tourist views. The detailed souvenir of Venice he created for the future 4th Duke of Bedford includes all the obvious landmarks yet these paintings are also rich in less grand sights. Walls of monasteries and convents block off the view, dilapidated palaces skulk in the shade, blank old facades bake in the sun. White marble is rarely spotless, but streaked with stains. It doesn’t dominate, yet it is part of a patchwork of reds and yellows, all reflected in green water. Canaletto did not paint a city in its prime but a place that had seen better days, gradually losing its shine. The golden age of Venice was centuries earlier when it was conquering colonies such as Cyprus and Nafplio and its artists included Giorgione and Titian. British tourists were conscious of being representatives of a rising empire beholding a dead one – and Canaletto does not hide the sense of ruin. He shows mouldering details on the Doge’s Palace and gives glimpses of tottering, uncared-for houses. One view, The Campo Francesco Morosini from San Stefano, is a spectacle of human bustle amid architectural rot: people are out promenading in puffy wigs and visiting the shops on the ground floors of high, crowded former palazzi, while at the far end of the square you can see fine buildings reduced to grey, bleak slums. “The square now attracts large numbers of tourists,” points out the wall text, but there’s another difference – these buildings are now much better cared for. The rise of modern tourism is not a completely negative phenomenon. When it started in the 1800s, architectural theorists such as John Ruskin helped chronicle and celebrate every detail of Venetian medieval architecture. Restoration and cleaning preserved palaces that might otherwise have toppled over by now. Without the rise of mass tourism, visiting Venice would have remained the privilege of a few aristocrats like that Duke of Bedford. Would we want that? This exhibition conveys what a cultural loss that would be, too. Canaletto is quietly absorbing, at his best, but I found myself longing for Monet’s incandescent paintings of Venice, a city dissolving in light – or the cinematic Venice of Luchino Visconti. The city that modern writers, film-makers and artists have portrayed is a place of shadows and memories, a ludicrously beautiful, impossible city where dream and reality are hard to tell apart. You can find that same mystery within the rational, meticulous views of Canaletto, but 24 views are quite a lot. And I am glad the city’s history did not stop in 1731 but has come into modern times when we plebeians can go there, too – even if we do spoil the view. Canaletto’s Venice Revisited is a the National Maritime Museum, London, from 1 April to 25 September.

3/29/2022,"The mayor of the city of Chernihiv, where more than 100 civilians have been killed by Russian bombs, has appealed to Volodymyr Zelenskiy for captured Russian pilots to be imprisoned rather than swapped for Ukrainian prisoners of war. Vladyslav Atroshenko made his emotional demand in response to the broadcast of an interview with Alexander Krasnoyartsev, a major in the Russian air force, who was shot down three weeks ago during a bombing sortie over the northern Ukrainian city. Krasnoyartsev, whose navigator, Konstantin Krivolapa, was killed when the plane was downed, claimed to Ukrainian interrogators in an hour-long interview posted on social media that he had not known he was bombing residential areas of the city. Atroshenko said in his televised appeal that the pilot was lying and that the citizens of Chernihiv would be opposed to any clemency being shown towards those involved in the bombing of his city. He said: “I am addressing President Volodymyr Zelenskiy from all possible TV channels: Volodymyr Oleksandrovych, I am speaking on behalf of all Chernihiv residents. “Please, do not rush to exchange military pilots, those scumbags. They lie when they say that they are given coordinates and that they do not see what they are bombing. “They were destroying the civilian population, they were destroying Chernihiv residents in broad daylight, at low altitudes. Therefore it is not necessary to hurry [to exchange] these scum, these bastards. It is not necessary to hurry.” Chernihiv is without water, gas or electricity after sustained bombing by artillery and Russian jets. Among a series of attacks on civilian targets, 10 people were killed two weeks ago while queueing for bread. There have been a number of prisoner swaps arranged by Moscow and Kyiv since the start of the month. Atroshenko, in reference to a video in which Krasnoyartsev was seen talking to his wife and mother on the telephone, said: “I do understand that the situation may require it [such trade], but we must bargain. There is a captured [pilot] Krasnoyartsev, I heard the interview he gave. I tell you honestly on behalf of all Chernihiv residents who died – he is lying. “What a piece of shit. He is lying, he knew exactly where he was dropping 500kg of bombs. Let him stay here in a Ukrainian prison … He calls his children on the phone and asks how are they doing. Can you imagine? To his children in Moscow or wherever he’s calling. Why doesn’t he ask how are Chernihiv residents are doing?” Krasnoyartsev, who was also involved in bombing missions in Syria, landed on the roof of a private house after parachuting out of his downed jet on 5 March. Once on the ground, he had hid in a barn but was discovered by an unarmed farmer on whom he repeatedly fired with his pistol, and killed. He told his interrogator: “A man ran after me, tried to chase me. I don’t know, perhaps with a pitchfork or something else. I used weapons. Those actions, that you need to shoot back, run and hide are automatic. Such kind of a condition. Later, I reproached myself repeatedly – I used weapons.” In the footage of the interrogations shared on social media, Krasnoyartsev is questioned by soldiers and in one film by Volodymyr Zolkin, a journalist and blogger who has conducted a number of interviews for broadcast with Russian prisoners. During his call with his family, Krasnoyartsev asked after the health of his son, who had chickenpox, and repeatedly questioned his mother over whether he was on an official prisoner of war list. Ukrainian interrogators questioned him over the name of his school and details about his childhood. When Krasnoyartsev asked why they were asking, the interrogators responded that Moscow was claiming that he was a Ukrainian actor playing the role of a downed pilot.",News/World news,Chernihiv mayor urges Zelenskiy not to swap captured Russian pilots for Ukrainian PoWs,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/29/chernihiv-mayor-captured-russian-pilots-ukrainian-pows-zelenskiy
3/29/2022,"Possessed of a truly eggsecrable subtitle – Mission Eggpossible – this Easter-themed German animation probably supplies just enough frantic hi-jinks to keep small children mildly absorbed over the holidays. But its scatty plot, about a group of master rabbits responsible for distributing Easter eggs and the jealous foxes who wish to supplant them, was seemingly cooked up by someone slipping into a chocolate-induced coma. Its difficulties are evident as Ute von Münchow-Pohl’s film can barely summon any interest in its own lead character, aspiring young rabbit Max. Max has the honour of being the first city rabbit asked to join the master rabbits. But he makes a formidable enemy when he humiliates bad-boy rabbit Leo while – in the now obligatory social-media shoo-in for kids’ cartoons – the latter is livestreaming to his fans. Leo, a failed academy pupil, takes his grievances to the band of forest-dwelling foxes who want to take over the egg racket. But the loathsome leporid is keeping his real intentions hidden from them: to destroy all the eggs entirely and, in the process, Easter itself. Rabbit Academy’s animation has a crisply hewn look that gives both the characters and the sacred mountain down which the eggs roll on looping tracks a snappy appeal. Shame the same can’t be said about the script. The Monsters University-type setup is utterly derivative, with some waffle about master rabbits having to locate their own special power, a bit of kung fu styling for chief instructor Madame Hermione, and a sickly lead song, Let’s Colour the World, that will surely make even five-year-olds want to insert a pencil in each nostril and head-butt a table. Max doesn’t so much have a story as a series of nagging moral checkpoints that sometimes contradict each other: find your own personal special power, but also, as one character chides him: “Is ‘I’ your favourite word?” Try to avoid letting your kids get sucked down this rabbit hole of self-affirmation, and stick on Watership Down instead.

3/29/2022,"In 1994, Ben Stiller codified the generation X ethos into celluloid with Reality Bites, which he directed and co-starred in as the film’s villain. We know he’s the villain because he works in an office and earns a real living, a marked contrast to the film’s four underemployed, holier-than-thou hipster protagonists. The tragic uncoolness of office life would go on to define the Gen X film-making of the 90s; Fight Club, Office Space, The Matrix, and even Good Will Hunting hinged on its main characters rejecting the yuppie, office-bound lifestyle in favor of a more authentic existence. Stiller has never left his generation far behind, as his 2013 remake of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty similarly warned of getting stuck in a soul-crushing office job. But he has returned to his generation’s ground zero with Severance, a hit series on AppleTV+ produced by Stiller (he also directed six of its nine episodes) that presents a uniquely dystopian view of office life. Its success with a new generation shows how the values of Gen X continue to reverberate through the years. The series, which releases new episodes on Fridays, revolves around Lumon, a mysterious company requiring employees working on classified projects to undergo a “severance” procedure that splits their consciousness in half. After having a chip injected into their brains, they achieve a radical work-life balance. When they’re on the clock in their windowless, basement office, they can’t remember their home life, and the minute they leave the office, they forget everything from work. It seems at first a strange but innocuous arrangement, until the series unveils its most horrifying implication: the “innies,” as the work-bound selves are known, never get to leave. They’re prisoners at work, which means they never get to enjoy the fruits of their labor. It would be indelicate to categorize their situation as modern-day slavery, although the show invites the comparison; we are told Lumon was incorporated in 1866, one year after the end of the Civil War. At its core, it’s another mystery box show, like Lost or True Detective (or any episode of Black Mirror), that teases the viewer with a big reveal. In this case, it’s a search for the true nature of Lumon’s work. The characters, led by Adam Scott’s newly promoted department chief, start to rebel against their confinement and their faux-friendly managers, while they speculate on what the data they’re processing actually represents. What do those numbers mean? Why all the secrecy? One employee suggests they are clearing the sea of fish to prepare for an underwater human civilization, while the discovery of a hidden room in the next hallway filled with baby goats delightfully muddies their investigation. With these shows, the mystery is the engine that powers the plot, but the world and its characters are the real fascination. What keeps people watching Severance is its hilarious and terrifyingly astute insights into the absurdism of corporate culture. Listen to the god-like reverence Lumon employees are required to espouse for the company’s deceased founder, Kier Egan. Note the meaningless prizes that management offers its employees, from pencil erasers, toy finger traps, and waffle parties, for various levels of achievement. The most recent episode marked the debut of the “music dance experience” offered by middle manager Mr Milchik (Tramell Tillman) to the series’ four central workers just as the group is on the precipice of rebellion. It’s a sanctioned, five-minute dance party with their choice of music (they go with Defiant Jazz) that, for a few minutes at least, calms their restless spirits. With these Kafkaesque notes, series creator Dan Erickson deftly captures the oppressiveness of modern office life. It’s persuasive and terrifying at once. When the music comes on, you want to dance, even though you know it’s a trick to keep you in your place. Although Severance was greenlit more than five years ago – Erickson originally sent the script’s pilot to Stiller’s production company as a writing sample – its filming was halted by the pandemic, and its emergence in the age of Covid seems strangely fitting. Stiller’s generation may have viewed those who worked for corporations as sell-outs, but today’s generation of white-collar workers have a more evolved antipathy towards the office. At the height of Covid, 71% of those who were able to work remotely did so, and even now, with restrictions loosening, more than half still do. Many will never go back, which could profoundly alter the relationship between management and labor. The American unemployment rate is near all-time lows, and many businesses remain desperate for employees. The attitude of Lumon’s employees towards its management – a growing suspicion that explodes into contempt – reflects current realities in which businesses cling to their employees with desperation and workers are realizing the scope of their own power. Although the final two episodes of Severance’s initial run have not yet aired, its second season has already begun production, ensuring that whatever mystery is revealed in its finale will only unlock bigger questions. In other words, the fight against management will not be over anytime soon, a fitting reflection of the world offscreen. The show’s success demonstrates that the somewhat performative anti-capitalist values of generation X have only become stronger with the next generation, who are seemingly prepared to renew their battle for the means of production for as many seasons as it takes.",Arts/Television & radio,How Severance became our favourite new mystery box TV show,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/29/severance-new-mystery-box-tv-show-review
3/29/2022,"Half of Conservative backbench MPs are now in the party’s green group, after the former minister Jeremy Hunt announced he had joined. The Conservative Environment Network (Cen) now has 133 MPs, leading green-minded Tories to claim that those who do not want net zero are in the minority. There are 360 sitting Conservative MPs, but 95 are government ministers or whips and therefore ineligible to join Cen. This is in contrast with the Net Zero Scrutiny Group of Conservative politicians, which has 19 publicly named members. Craig Mackinlay MP, who leads the group, told Politico that 58 MPs had signed up, but he did not provide a list. The Net Zero Scrutiny Group has close ties to the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a group that has been described as climate sceptical. While a backlash to the government’s green plans has been growing at a modest rate, the number of MPs in the Cen is increasing. Eighteen Tories have joined since the start of the year, which includes some who were elected in the 2019 general election. Sam Hall, the director of the group, said this proved it was the “biggest and fastest-growing Conservative movement in parliament”. Hunt said: “I am delighted to join the Conservative Environment Network to champion net zero and nature conservation. “Now, more than ever, in light of the global gas crisis and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it’s vital we decarbonise the UK’s economy by 2050. We must develop more homegrown clean energy, including renewables and new nuclear. This will lower people’s bills, strengthen our energy security and avoid the worst consequences of climate change.” The large size of the group could bode well for green policies in the upcoming energy plan, which some fear could be derailed by those lobbying for fracking and an expansion of oil and gas. Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace’s policy director, said: “This is yet another sign that the stark reality of the climate crisis keeps chipping away at the climate scepticism that has dogged the Conservative benches for decades. “We have seen Boris Johnson going from harsh criticism of wind power to full-throated advocacy. Half of the Conservative backbenches are now committed to climate action, avoiding the disruptive partisanship on environmental issues seen in the USA, Australia and elsewhere. But this should have happened at least a decade ago, when the threat of the climate crisis and the benefits of renewable power were already obvious. “Now the question is whether these MPs are willing to hold their government’s feet to the fire on the urgent action we need to ditch fossil fuels, fix our draughty homes and tackle the climate crisis.”",News/Politics,Half of Tory backbench MPs have joined party’s green group,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/29/tory-mps-conservative-environment-network-green-net-zero
3/29/2022,"Plans to allow teams to qualify for the Champions League based on historical performance have received the backing of Europe’s top clubs as the best way to ensure the competition remains “premium” and “inclusive”. The influential European Club Association has developed the change – as exclusively revealed by the Guardian – as part of a process of reforming Uefa’s competitions from 2024 and on Tuesday also gave its backing at its congress in Vienna to new rules regarding Financial Fair Play (FFP). The reforms, originated in a working group of ECA members and Uefa officials, will include reserving two of the 36 Champions League group places for teams who would otherwise have played in the Europa League but have a high-ranking coefficient based on previous continental performance. These two places would be awarded in addition to those based on league performance, with a maximum of six clubs entering the Champions League from any one national association. Speaking at the congress the ECA vice-president, Aki Riihilahti, said he was “very happy” with the proposals, which will be drafted and ratified by Uefa. More countries than ever will be guaranteed group-stage places across Uefa’s three men’s club competitions. “When we’re talking about the European performance spots, we added domestic performance because you have to look at the whole picture,” said Riihilahti, who is the CEO of HJK Helsinki and sat on the working group. “How do we have quality premium competitions which are also inclusive? When we add the domestic performance [that means] the next best is there. There’s no leapfrogging. It’s fair, it adds value, and overall when you look at the total picture it makes sense. As a smaller country’s champion, I was very happy with the whole thing.” Also agreed in principle are new FFP rules which would see clubs competing in European football adhere to an annual cap on the money they can spend on transfers and wages. That figure is understood to be 70% of annual revenue, with the potential for fines or docked points should the level be exceeded. The previous method of calculation for FFP looked retrospectively at a club’s spending and set a limit on the money any club could lose. Again, these rules are to be finalised by Uefa. The two-day meeting in Vienna showed a united front among the 247 men’s clubs who are members, with plans also announced to create a membership structure for women’s clubs. ECA members committed an initial €1m to assist Ukrainian refugees. Three clubs missing from the list are the remaining European Super League-supporting clubs, Juventus, Barcelona and Real Madrid. This was the first in-person gathering of the ECA since the attempted launch of the ESL last year, and the ECA’s new chairman, Nasser al-Khelaifi of Paris St-Germain, said he did not expect a recurrence of any such breakaway. “Today we are proving that there is a big potential in the Uefa club competitions and we don’t need another system,” Khelaifi said. “Everyone is against it, from the fans and the media to the clubs – big and small – and [the breakaway clubs] are three only. The strange thing is that they are now enjoying playing in Uefa competitions; they are playing in the best competition. There is no potential they can do something like [revive the Super League]: we are united. In the ECA we found our unity in 2021.”",Sport/Football,Champions League places based on historical performance receive backing,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/29/champions-league-places-based-on-historical-performance-receive-backing
3/29/2022,"England versus South Africa. A World Cup semi-final that – if the rest of the tournament is anything to go by – is likely to come down to the wire. Heather Knight at the helm, facing off against Marizanne Kapp, Laura Wolvaardt & co. If that all sounds familiar, it’s because it was exactly the situation faced by England on their path to world domination, five years ago at home in 2017. On that occasion, at Bristol, England were left relying on an unlikely hero with the bat – Anya Shrubsole. With England eight wickets down and needing two runs to win from the last three balls, Shrubsole stuck out her bat and flayed a boundary through point: cue heartbreak for South Africa, and relief for England. The good news, if you are English, is that Shrubsole will be available for selection in Thursday’s repeat of the 2017 semi-final at Christchurch, after being rested against Bangladesh. Despite Shrubsole’s availability, Knight is hoping that this time around, the semi-final will not be decided by England’s No 10. “It’d be a little bit nicer if it wasn’t as close, because that’s one of the most nervous finishes of a cricket game I’ve ever had!” she said on Monday. But this is a tournament which has seen England lose their first three matches before just about jittering across the line in must-win games against India and New Zealand. Meanwhile, opponents South Africa have experienced four final-over finishes; their last – against India – came down to the final ball. Another close match may well be in the offing. Knight brushed off England’s poor start to the tournament, saying that her side are “in a very good place”: “It’s been a remarkable turnaround. It shows the character that we’ve got in this group to pick ourselves up after a poor start to the competition. “We’ve built a bit of momentum in the last few games. We feel like we’re peaking at the right time,” she added. It is true that England have now won four matches on the trot, facing down the ignominy of being eliminated at the group stage as defending champions. But given that their only convincing wins in the tournament have come against bottom-placed Pakistan and Bangladesh, a semi-final against a South African side who finished above them in the table is going to be a stern test. England have deployed the same approach throughout the tournament: hand Shrubsole and Katherine Brunt the new ball, and build the team around that, whether they make breakthroughs or not. Freya Davies bowled a consistent, nagging line and length against Bangladesh, returning two for 36, while left-armer Tash Farrant remains on the sidelines. Nonetheless, Knight has already indicated that England will be reverting to the usual suspects for Thursday’s semi-final. Bizarrely, Charlie Dean’s selection also remains up in the air, despite the fact that she has taken more wickets for England in the tournament (10) than any other bowler bar Sophie Ecclestone. Knight has been effusive with praise for the young off-spinner, who was brought into the side last summer based on the captain’s own hunch after playing alongside her at London Spirit in the Hundred. “Sometimes going into these big world events, you don’t know how players are going to react,” Knight said on Monday. “The way she’s come in, she’s taken wickets, she’s dealt with the pressure, has been a big positive for her.” Nonetheless, she refused to confirm whether Dean would play on Thursday, saying that it depended on pitch conditions. Laura Wolvaardt The leading run-scorer in the World Cup so far, with five half-centuries in seven matches and a tournament average of 62. If she can score 24 or more on Thursday, she will surpass Debbie Hockley’s record (achieved at the 1997 tournament) of most runs scored at a World Cup. England will be desperate to atone for previous mistakes, after fluffing three chances against her in their group-stage fixture (she went on to score a crucial 77). Brunt and Shrubsole will need to be extremely disciplined with their lengths to avoid feeding her strength – a gorgeous cover drive. Lizelle Lee South Africa’s opening batter missed the first part of the tournament due to attending the birth of her baby, and has subsequently had an unusually quiet World Cup. In six innings so far, she has reached double figures just twice, and she has a top score of 36. Nonetheless Knight singled her out in Monday’s press conference as a potentially “explosive” threat – for good reason. She scored more runs than anyone else last year in ODI cricket, and if she does get her eye in, England could be in trouble. Shabnim Ismail Small but ferocious, Ismail has clocked speeds of 77mph this World Cup and is fresh from a spell against India which yielded two key scalps and cost them their place in the semi-finals. She went wicketless against England in the group-stage fixture but was only able to bowl half her allocation of overs, forced off the field after injuring her big toe. She was also tasked with bowling the final over in the 2017 semi-final, conceding the runs which ultimately lost South Africa their place in the final – so she’llwill be keen for revenge this time around. With no shake-up on the cards, it looks likely that South Africa will end up facing an almost identical team to the one which they beat by three wickets in the group stage. England have overcome some of their failings since then - their fielding has dramatically improved, while the number of extras conceded has fallen, too. But their new opening partnership of Tammy Beaumont and Danni Wyatt, whose best stand this tournament is 20 against Pakistan, will once again come under scrutiny against a South African bowling line-up widely considered the best in the world. Marizanne Kapp proved England’s nemesis last time, bagging her first five-wicket haul in international cricket and scoring 32 from 42 balls after South Africa’s run-chase had stalled. Seamers Shabnim Ismail and Ayabonga Khaka, who are two of the top five wicket-takers in the tournament to date, are also potent threats. Should England succeed in reaching the final, it will represent a dramatic turnaround of fortunes. But for Knight, this semi-final is a chance to look forward, not back. “You don’t want to go crazy and make a huge deal of it,” she said of her side’s earlier run of losses. “We go in as equals, and start afresh on Thursday.”",Sport/Sport,England look to momentum and history in Cricket World Cup semi,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/29/england-south-africa-semi-final-womens-cricket-world-cup
3/29/2022,"No 10 looks set to be forced to release the security advice relating to Boris Johnson’s decision to give a peerage to Evgeny Lebedev after Tory rebels threatened to support a Labour motion calling for it to be published. Amid evidence the intelligence services had concerns about the peerage, Labour is using a humble address in the House of Commons to force the disclosure of the documents. It was expected to fail as the government opposed the release of the information and was ordering Tory MPs to vote against. However, a group of Conservative backbenchers threatened to rebel against the government, saying it was reminiscent of the Owen Paterson debacle when they were ordered to back a change in the standards rules that was politically unpopular and doomed to failure. Faced with a revolt, the Tory whips performed a dramatic U-turn and told MPs they would be allowed to abstain. A rebel estimated there were 50 people prepared to abstain in the face of whips originally instructing them to vote against. They said that in the aftermath of the Paterson scandal, pressure would be kept on the government on standards issues. “Next time, I’m not going to tell the whips I won’t be voting with the government – they have to learn to stop making these stupid decisions and being forced into a U-turn. We’re just lucky it was such as quick win this time,” one Tory backbencher said. The Labour move was led by Angela Rayner, the party’s deputy leader, who on Tuesday afternoon will use a Commons debate to demand information concerning Lord Lebedev’s appointment from the Cabinet Office. The Guardian revealed in October 2020 that Johnson met Lebedev in March that year, shortly before the House of Lords appointments commission, which scrutinises all nominations, wrote to the prime minister. The commission is understood to have expressed concerns about Lebedev’s proposed peerage and asked Downing Street to reconsider. Peers on the commission were said to have had confidential briefing from the UK security services, which suggested the appointment was a potential security risk because of Lebedev’s father, Alexander Lebedev, a former KGB agent who worked undercover at the Soviet embassy in London. Downing Street is then alleged to have sought further assurances from the security agencies. They provided extra context, which was enough to lead to a different outcome, and the peers signed off the appointment. Johnson has denied he intervened to secure a peerage and Lebedev said in the aftermath of further reporting by the Sunday Times that he was not an “agent of Russia”. Johnson’s former chief adviser Dominic Cummings said he was in the room when Cabinet Office officials told Johnson the intelligence services and other parts of the deep state had “serious reservations about the PM’s plan”. He said the prime minister stopped talking to him about the issue and “got a stooge to creep into the Cabinet Office labyrinth and cut a deal”. Rayner will ask the Cabinet Office to hand over all information about the appointment but the wording of the address allows some parts to be redacted if there are national security considerations. “This is an important matter of national security,” Rayner said, ahead of the debate. “The British public have a right to know if and how an individual of apparent concern to our intelligence services was granted a seat in the heart of our parliament by Boris Johnson, against security advice.” In response to Labour’s motion, Lebedev tweeted: “Openness and transparency are pillars of our democratic system, so I welcome the call for security advice about me provided to HOLAC to be released. I have nothing to hide.” He has previously said he is “not a security risk to this country, which I love”, and recently issued a statement through one of the newspapers he owns, the Evening Standard, in which he dismissed the “farcical” speculation as Russophobia. He said some of the “incredible questions” posed to him by journalists were absurd as he denied being an “agent of Russia”. He also condemned the invasion of Ukraine and called on Vladimir Putin to withdraw his troops. In response to Labour’s motion, Lebedev tweeted: “Openness andtransparency are pillars of our democratic system, so I welcome thecall for security advice about me provided to HOLAC to be released.

3/29/2022,"Labour is to proscribe three leftwing groups including the Alliance for Workers’ Liberty, a movement connected to a number of current and former MPs that also has links with pro-European campaigns. Sources on the party’s national executive committee said it was right to ban Labour members from being members of the AWL, describing it as “an entryist group that was banned until very recently” which had historically stood candidates against Labour. The group’s association with the party has long been controversial and there have been attempts to eject its members, but the movement deregistered with the Electoral Commission two days after Jeremy Corbyn was elected party leader, in order to support his leadership. The group has also been controversial among other fringe groups because it took a strong stance against antisemitism in the Labour party, as well as being outspoken against Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Former Labour MP Gloria de Piero is among those to have been associated with the group in the past. The group has also worked with those in the anti-Brexit movement, including Another Europe is Possible. The Labour MP Clive Lewis condemned the move to proscribe the three groups, two of which have been banned for their links to other proscribed groups that have been outspoken in their denial of anti-semitism allegations in the party. “Proscription lists; mass expulsions; the centralisation of power. It’s naive to think the ‘crisis of democracy’ and the slide to authoritarianism afflicting western polities won’t affect our own political institutions,” Lewis tweeted. The other two groups the party will proscribe are the Labour Left Alliance and the Socialist Labour Network. Last year, the NEC proscribed four other groups – Socialist Appeal, Labour in Exile Network, Labour Against the Witchhunt and Resist – members of which have been auto-excluded from the party. Labour Against the Witchhunt claims that antisemitism allegations during the Corbyn years were politically motivated and supports members excluded for anti-semitism. The Labour in Exile Network, is intended to expressly welcome expelled or suspended members. Labour party rules allow for the expulsion of anyone that stands against an official Labour candidate or has links with a “political organisation other than an official Labour group”. Much of AWL’s lineage derives from a Trotskyist paper, Socialist Organiser, that was proscribed by the Labour conference in 1990. Momentum, the grassroots leftwing movement set up under Corbyn, condemned the latest decision to ban the groups. “As a democratic socialist party, Labour has a proud tradition of welcoming socialists of all traditions, while disciplinary procedures already exist for individual members that behave inappropriately,” it said. “These factional proscriptions will create hundreds of time-consuming and pointless investigations into members for simply liking tweets or signing petitions. This has absolutely nothing to do with winning elections. Instead, it is yet another example of a Labour leadership obsessing over purging the left at a time when socialist ideas are more popular and urgent than ever.”",News/Politics,Labour to ban leftwing groups including Alliance for Workers’ Liberty,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/29/labour-to-ban-leftwing-groups-including-alliance-for-workers-liberty
3/29/2022,"A surge in credit card borrowing last month has prompted concerns that low-income households are turning to expensive forms of lending to cope with rising costs of food, clothing and fuel. Figures from the Bank of England showed credit card borrowing jumped by £1.5bn in February to push the total amount of unsecured lending up by 90% on the prior month to £1.9bn. The central bank said the rise pushed the annual growth rate for all forms of unsecured credit from 3.2% to 4.4% – the highest rate of expansion since February 2020 – raising the total outstanding balance of consumer credit to £199.5bn. With shoppers turning to cheaper supermarkets such as Lidl and Aldi to make ends meet and increasing numbers of families saying they are being forced to choose between eating and heating, anti-poverty charities said it was worrying that consumers were spending more on credit cards. Joanna Elson, the chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, the charity that runs National Debtline and Business Debtline, said the figures provide “an indicator of the underlying challenges households face in meeting the growing cost of living” as she called on the chancellor to provide more targeted help for hard-pressed households. “Our concern is that more people will be pushed to credit to cover rising bills, which could be storing up problems further down the line when repayments are due,” she said. She added that the lifting of the energy price cap on 1 April meant a squeeze on household finances was only going to worsen in the coming weeks. “While the government’s council tax and energy bill rebates will help some households to a small degree, more targeted support is needed urgently,” she said. “As a minimum, this should include significantly uprating benefits and introducing further targeted support to help people struggling with the steep increase in their energy bills.” Some economists said it was possible the increase in credit card spending, which followed the lifting of restrictions related to the Omicron variant, showed a renewed confidence among consumers before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: “It is more likely that households had the confidence to borrow and spend a bit more and/or were willing to use borrowing/savings to smooth their spending.” However, Samuel Tombs, the chief economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said separate figures showing a collapse in consumer confidence between January and March, and a sharp slowing of mortgage lending, pointed to a caution among most households. “The big rise in consumer borrowing in February – the largest since April 2018 – likely reflects households attempting to maintain their consumption at a time when real disposable income is falling sharply, rather than them going on a spending spree,” he said. Bank figures also showed that consumers were supported in their efforts to borrow by lower loan rates in February, despite an increase in the central bank’s base rate from 0.1% to 0.5% between December and February. Credit card interest rates averaged 18.26%, down 0.29 percentage points, while standard credit loans fell to 6.14% from 6.23%. Intense competition among mortgage lenders meant the increase in the base rate hardly altered the average fixed-rate offering, which increased from 1.58% to 1.59%. Tombs added that the value of “excess savings” edged higher to £186.0bn, from £185.7bn in January, showing that households were unwilling to run down their savings while the economic outlook was uncertain. The Treasury’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has predicted that the UK’s economic growth will be sustained this year and next by consumers spending much of their accumulated savings. Tombs said the stock of unsecured credit last month was “a hefty £26bn below its pre-Covid peak”, so households without savings should be able to ramp up their borrowing further. “We continue to think, therefore, that the economy will narrowly avoid sliding into recession this year, despite the grim outlook for households’ real incomes,” he added.",Lifestyle/Money,UK credit card borrowing surges amid cost of living crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/29/uk-credit-card-cost-of-living-crisis-inflation
