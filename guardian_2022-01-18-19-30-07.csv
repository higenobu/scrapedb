1/18/2022,"Hong Kong has ordered thousands of hamsters be surrendered for “disposal” after traces of Covid-19 were found on 11 animals in a pet shop. The order includes pets that were bought days before Christmas be handed over, with a warning not to “kiss or abandon them on the street” as Hong Kong and mainland China attempt to sustain a zero Covid strategy, attempting to suppress all outbreaks internally while maintaining tight border controls with the outside world.  Authorities announced on Tuesday that traces of the virus were detected on 11 hamsters out of 178 hamsters, rabbits and chinchillas tested at the Little Boss pet shop and associated warehouse in Causeway Bay while investigating the city’s first untraceable Delta variant diagnosis in more than three months, in a 23-year-old store employee. Two employees were also confirmed to have the disease, including one who cleans out the animal cages and handles the hamsters. In response they ordered the immediate suspension of hamster sales and imports of all rodents. An estimated 2,000 hamsters, including any bought since 22 December, must be handed over, local media reported, and the owners must report for testing. Hong Kong’s health secretary, Sophia Chan, conceded there was no evidence domestic animals can pass the disease to humans, but authorities were acting out of caution. “We have assessed the risks of these batches are relatively high and therefore made the decision based on public health needs,” the director of agriculture, fisheries and conservation, Dr Leung Siu-fai, said. “We urge all pet owners to observe strict hygiene when handling their pets and cages. Do not kiss or abandon them on the streets.” All animals taken from the Causeway Bay shop would be dealt with “humanely”, authorities said. Louis Yeung at the Chinchilla and Pets shop on Hong Kong island said he had about 20 hamsters in stock and was waiting for instructions. “A man called me and asked my phone number and said he will send a message to me, but so far I don’t have any information from [the government],” he told the Guardian. “We just follow the government instructions. There’s nothing to do, worry or not worry. If they decide something we must do it.” Leung said he was surprised to hear hamsters could get infected and was also worried by reports of virus transmission on food packaging. “I don’t really understand what we should do. I don’t really know if the human takes this [virus] to a hamster or the hamster takes this to the human.” The imported hamster theory comes just a day after Chinese authorities, who are similarly battling outbreaks while pursuing a zero Covid strategy, blamed an untraceable case of the Omicron variant in Beijing on a package sent from Canada, via the US and Hong Kong. While the global science community is sceptical on the likelihood of Covid-19 spreading by international mail, at least at the frequency it is reported in China, Beijing authorities said testing had found traces of the virus on the outside and inside of the package. There have been previous cases of animal infection, including several pets in Hong Kong, over the course of the pandemic. In 2020 Denmark culled its entire population of 15 million minks, after some were found to be carrying a mutated variant of Covid-19. It also banned mink breeding until this month. Several thousand carcasses which had been hastily buried in West Jutland began rising out of the earth some months later, prompting alarm and a police operation to rebury the macabre scene. It appears it was known hamsters could be infected with the disease – a May 2020 study by leading Hong Kong infectious disease experts used the animals to determine the effectiveness of mask-wearing, by lining some hamster cages with them and measuring the transmission between infected animals and their health neighbours.",News/World news,Hong Kong to cull thousands of hamsters after Covid found on 11,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/hong-kong-cull-thousands-hamsters-covid-pet-shop-virus-animals
1/18/2022,"The question is inevitable and Maro Itoje, to his credit, has the punchline ready. “I can assure you I’m not in the middle of a career transition and looking to take to the Old Vic stage,” he says, chuckling. What a letdown. When England’s head coach, Eddie Jones, revealed last year that he had sent his best forward away for acting lessons, surely a West End debut was only a matter of time? It seems not. Instead Itoje is as committed to the day job as ever, with his Equity card still in the post. “I think there was a bit of miscommunication,” he continues, insisting the “communication classes” he attended with the team psychologist, Andrea Furst, and an external specialist fell some way short of an audition for Othello. “While I don’t think I was necessarily bad at communicating – I think I’m fairly articulate and can get a message across – there’s always room for growth. When the opportunity arose I said: ‘OK, let me take advantage of this resource that is available.’”  Tellingly Jones has also since retracted the words from the book passage in which he described Itoje as an unlikely future England captain because he was too “inward-looking”. It was a pretty harsh message for the only player in his squad who would be an automatic pick for a current World XV. If England prosper in the 2022 Six Nations, the Saracens lock will be a major reason why. So how is Itoje feeling now, physically and mentally? Fine, though a bout of Covid – “a bit of a cough, heavy chest and fatigue” – just before Christmas did slow him down temporarily. Crucially he senses he and England are in a better place than last year when they finished fifth in the Six Nations. More relaxed Covid protocols this time, he argues, could help England more than anyone. “Hearing how other camps were run, our restrictions were fairly tight. I don’t think you can underestimate the importance of teamship and camaraderie. You only develop that by spending time with each other and perhaps that was a bit restricted.” He is all too aware, nevertheless, that England will have to improve and build on the promise they displayed in the autumn. “You could probably pick apart aspects of our game this time last year that weren’t sharp enough. They’re all areas that Eddie has identified and has been trying to improve since. I like to think our attack is in a better place than it was. Obviously the team has been shaken up a bit and it was probably necessary. As players you just hope it’s not shaken up at your own expense.” Deep down Itoje clearly still feels England have sufficient talent to beat anyone. “My expectation, as an England player, is that whenever we take the field against anyone we should win,” he says, speaking as part of his commitment as an ambassador for Vitality. “That’s not to say I don’t respect the other nations because they’re very good teams who have beaten us before. I have a lot of respect for them. But that’s the mindset I have. My expectation for England is always to be on the front foot.” After 51 caps he is clearly keen to show that his competitive fires still rage. “Maybe the pandemic has highlighted this to me further but sometimes you can start taking things for granted or as a given. Most people in this world will not get the opportunities to do some of the things I’m doing. And these opportunities don’t come around too often. You have a duty to yourself, to give it your best shot. If you do that you can sleep easy at night.” These are also pivotal times, he believes, for rugby generally. “The next 18 months are massive. The 2023 World Cup needs to be a landmark event and I think it will be. But in terms of the general marketing strategy of rugby at the moment I’m not sure it’s doing everything it needs to do to reach a wider audience. The broadcasters could package things in different ways, the clubs could be more engaging and reach out to different communities. “I don’t feel it is something that will just happen with time. It is something that rugby needs to put a conscious effort towards because it isn’t the dominant sport in this country. Rugby is football’s little brother, reaching up to the table to try and grab some food. In order to do that you have to make a constant effort to do more. I might be wrong but I’m not sure if rugby is doing that. “The trick is to pull fans into the game who aren’t necessarily already interested. Look at the impact of Drive to Survive. You don’t even need to be a Formula One fan to find that compelling. It’s about the human stories. Something like that would have a positive impact on how our game is seen.” Leading role or not, England’s star man is still eager to shine.

1/18/2022,"The Wolves winger Adama Traoré has said that “all too often in football the headlines are stolen by racist actions” as he joined Common Goal’s anti-racism project ARP. The Spain international joins a long list of footballers and managers who have pledged 1% of their salary via Common Goal, the social impact movement in global football. There are more than 200 professional players and managers from 45 nationalities on the team, including Pernille Harder, Paulo Dybala, Vivianne Miedema, Jürgen Klopp, Serge Gnabry, Christiane Endler and Giorgio Chiellini.  Traoré said: “If I’ve learned anything in my career so far, it’s that leading with action rather than empty words is what counts in making a difference. I’ve become part of Common Goal in order to tackle racism through the anti-racist project. It’s important to me to use my platform to be part of the solution. “I know that my 1% alone isn’t going to fix this problem, and my voice alone won’t solve systemic racism. But, if I can encourage others to join us in this fight, nothing can stand in the way of the impact we can make together. All too often in football the headlines are stolen by racist actions.” ARP is an action-based programme aimed at ending racism in football though comprehensive anti-racism training for decision makers such as club owners and presidents, professional and grassroots coaches, players of all levels, and fans. The ARP launched last year in the US with a coalition of industry leaders including clubs such as Chicago Fire, Angel City and Oakland Roots, plus professional players including the Manchester City and USMNT goalkeeper Zack Steffen, and also the largest fan group in the country, The American Outlaws. After the success of the ARP in North America, Traoré aims to help Common Goal to grow the project in Europe. Common Goal was launched in 2017 when a single player, Juan Mata of Manchester United and Spain, committed to pledge 1% of his salary to a collective fund that invests in high-impact community organisations using football to empower young people. Mata said: “It’s fantastic to see another person from the Premier League join myself, Kasper Schmeichel and Jürgen Klopp in this growing team of now over 200 professionals from around the world. In England there are so many inspiring female players that are already Common Goal members, and I hope that Adama joining the movement in order to take tangible action on tackling racism will inspire other male colleagues from the Premier League to join the movement. One per cent is almost nothing, but together we can create meaningful change and the time to act is now.”",Sport/Football,Adama Traoré to tackle racism in football: ‘It’s important I use my platform’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/18/adama-traore-to-tackle-racism-in-football-its-important-i-use-my-platform
1/18/2022,"There’s a lot going on in this fervent and cathartically personal movie from writer-director Matt Fifer, in which he himself stars as Ben, a young gay guy in New York who begins a relationship with Sam, played by Sheldon D Brown. (Brown also contributed personal material to story development, evidently in the form of personal trauma.) Sam has not come out to his work colleagues or his very religious father Francis (Michael Potts) and Ben has not yet been able to tell his mother Debbie (Sandra Bauleo) that he was abused as a child by his stepfather at their family home in Long Island, where the sound of the cicadas brings back complex, painful memories. So Ben’s suppression has resulted in anxiety and physical symptoms whose psychosomatic origin he has been unable to accept.  The gentle, realist tone of the film is contrasted by the broader comic identity of some of the smaller roles: Ben’s wacky therapist Sophie (Cobie Smulders), who has a dog called Klonopin, and the faintly predatory guy called Bo (David Burtka) who hangs around while Ben does his secondary painting and decorating job. Scott Adsit (from TV’s 30 Rock) plays Ben’s long-suffering doctor who has to convince him that his problems, though real enough, need a doctor of a different kind to be treated. This is a watchable, fluent indie film with some lovely ambient cityscape shots of New York, though perhaps a little emotionally and dramatically unfocused. There are sympathetic, heartfelt performances from Fifer and Brown, and some funny material about the role played in their relationship by the children’s book The Very Hungry Caterpillar.  Cicada is released on 21 January in cinemas and digital platforms",Arts/Film,Cicada review – slow-burn gay drama with beautiful scenes of New York ,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/18/cicada-review-slow-burn-gay-drama-with-beautiful-scenes-of-new-york
1/18/2022,"Having personal conversations at work, in the days before mobile phones existed, could be perilous. Usually, you had to duck into an unoccupied desk space or wait until everyone was at lunch. But I worked on a trading floor – each desk crammed next to another, with everyone eating lunch there, too. Perilous didn’t begin to cover it. In addition, phones rang constantly, people shouted across the room or at each other, and market information was broadcast over the Tannoy while overhead TVs blared CNBC and Bloomberg News. Private conversations had to wait.  Except the thing with love, especially fiery new love, is that it doesn’t wait. One day, early in my newlywed life, I got to work at 6.30am, as usual, fuming about an argument from the night before that my husband and I had failed to resolve. When he called me later that morning to “check in” (his code for “just making sure you agree I was right all along”), I lost it. A massive row ensued that lasted for, literally, hours. I had to conduct this angry marathon from under my desk, the only place I could find that had a semblance of privacy. Beneath my workstation, I curled in a foetal position, shrieking and sobbing, before coming up to take calls from clients, get prices from traders, confirm and complete trades, file the “tickets”, and then get back to marital war. I was new to the trading floor and new to marriage, and I definitely jeopardised both that day. But, as is often the case, there were silver linings: that row proved to be a bonding experience for me and the two (very English) guys who sat on either side of me. Appalled and petrified at the volcano of unfettered emotion erupting around their feet, they handled it the only way they knew: by pretending everything was fine. They ducked under my desk to get me when my clients called, offered me cups of tea (and Diet Coke) from time to time, and absolutely did not acknowledge that personal issues were being aired in front of them. Neither was married and I think that day extended their singledom by some margin, but their supportive efforts in my time of need were truly touching. Over the following years, that day was never again mentioned between us, but I know it marked us all for ever. I met one of them in 2019, after one of my comedy shows, and he opened with: “You’re still married! Ha! Good stuff.” I hear him. Sindhu Vee’s UK tour Alphabet runs until 18 February.

1/18/2022,"Dominic Raab has admitted that lying to parliament is “normally” a resigning matter, amid claims that the prime minister deliberately misled MPs over his knowledge of a Downing Street party. Boris Johnson’s former senior aide Dominic Cummings had earlier accused the prime minister of lying when No 10 denied Johnson had been warned against allowing a “bring your own booze” garden party during lockdown.  The justice secretary said it was “nonsense” that Johnson had lied to MPs, saying he felt the prime minister’s account was to be believed. But he added that any deliberate falsehood in the Commons would leave Johnson in jeopardy. “If it’s lying, deliberate in the way you describe, if it’s not corrected immediately, it would normally, under the ministerial code and the governance around parliament, be a resigning matter,” Raab told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Tuesday. Raab had said on Sky News earlier that Johnson was “confident he’s been straightforward” with parliament and said the “PM has been very clear” that Cummings’ claims were “not true or accurate”. Johnson admitted to parliament last week that he attended drinks in the Downing Street garden on 20 May 2020 but claimed he had not realised it was a social gathering. Cummings wrote a blogpost on Monday challenging that account. He said he told Martin Reynolds, a senior official, that the invitation broke the rules and claimed Reynolds replied: “So long as it’s socially distanced I think it’s OK, I’ll check with the PM if he’s happy for it to go ahead.” Cummings said in his blogpost: “Not only me but other eyewitnesses who discussed this at the time would swear under oath this is what happened.” Sue Gray, the senior civil servant in charge of the inquiry into Downing Street lockdown parties, could make a formal request to interview Cummings, Whitehall sources confirmed. It is within the remit of the inquiry to approach former members of staff if their evidence might be relevant. No 10 staff had hoped that the inquiry, which is examining more than 15 separate allegations of illegal gatherings in Downing Street, would conclude this week. Because of the constant drip of new parties and developments, officials believe it may not report until next week. Cummings then said that, during a discussion over the future of the cabinet secretary and Reynolds, he had said to the prime minister something like: “Martin’s invited the building to a drinks party, this is what I’m talking about, you’ve got to grip this madhouse.” Cummings added: “The PM waved it aside. I had told him repeatedly the PPS [parliamentary private secretary] should be replaced, as had other competent officials who knew the whole structure needed a huge upgrade in personnel and management.”",News/Politics,"Lying to parliament a resigning matter, says Raab, amid claims PM misled MPs",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/18/raab-admits-lying-to-parliament-a-resigning-matter-amid-claims-pm-misled-mps-boris-johnson
1/18/2022,"The 1980s pop singer and actor Hazel O’Connor is recovering after what her family described as a “serious medical event”. O’Connor was found at home in southern France on Sunday and taken to hospital, where she was found to have suffered a bleed on the brain. She was placed in an induced coma for 24 hours while receiving treatment.  Her brother Neil O’Connor wrote in a blog post that since being taken out of the coma on Monday, she has “been showing a lot of progress although, saying that, her recovery is going to take a while but she is tough and is responding to stimuli and to treatment. She’s receiving the best of care and I thank the French medical service there for taking such good care of her.” Neil added: “I’ve already learned that she’s started to show her usual feistiness.” O’Connor was a striking figure in the British pop scene in the early 1980s, after acting in the film Breaking Glass alongside Jonathan Pryce and Phil Daniels, and performing songs on its soundtrack. The album reached the Top 5, and two singles from it, Eighth Day and Will You?, landed in the Top 10 in 1980. Her solo album Sons and Lovers was released the same year, and she has continued to put out music ever since alongside roles in TV and theatre. O’Connor had been due to tour the UK, beginning in March.

1/18/2022,"Everton are all over the shop. Having sacked Rafa Benitez after laying off all the folk he didn’t want, they’ve been rebuffed in their efforts to force the Belgian FA into sharing Roberto Martínez. They’re now considering José Mourinho, for goodness sake. And now there are reports claiming owner Farhad Moshiri is considering upping sticks and cutting his losses. Given the pig’s lug he’s made of the last six managerial appointments, some may be quite sanguine about that particular prospect, but while it wouldn’t necessarily hinder, it wouldn’t necessarily help, either. And Everton could do with some help right now. Manchester United are a little bit further into the process of getting their house in order. To this end, they want Aston Villa heartbeat John McGinn, Lazio midfielder Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, and/or RB Leipzig’s Amadou Haidara.  Newcastle United are the third – and longest-serving – members of the Shambolic Big Club Club. Today’s attempt to extricate themselves from the mess they’ve created comes in the form of a £25m offer for Duvan Zapata. Atalanta want nearly double that for the Colombian striker. Back to Manchester United, as it would seem they’re in for a fourth midfielder, Denis Zakaria of Borussia Mönchengladbach. Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool are all threatening to ruin that particular plan. Meanwhile Anthony Martial wants out, we’ve known this for quite some time. He’s drawn up a list of preferred destinations, and he’s aiming for the stars: Juventus, Barcelona and Sevilla. Barcelona are also in the running for Adama Traoré, and may even catch the speedy bugger. Tottenham hope to shepherd the Wolves winger to north London instead. One midfielder whose links to Old Trafford are cooling – so lump on, folks – is Aurélien Tchouaméni. The young Monaco man is reportedly off to Chelsea instead. And Rangers defender Borna Barisic, linked with a reunion with his old boss Steven Gerrard at Aston Villa, may have to settle for Watford instead.
