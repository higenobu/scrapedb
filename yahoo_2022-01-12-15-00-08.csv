1/12/2022,"By Kantaro Komiya TOKYO (Reuters) - Premium telescopes, violin bows and speciality paper are bucking a deflationary trend that has defined Japan for decades - all have had their prices hiked by companies confident they can charge more without losing business. Years of stagnant prices and wages have made Japan Inc nervous about charging more for fear of alienating shoppers and losing market share. Traditionally, firms have chosen belt-tightening in the face of rising costs. While the overall rise in prices is still modest, more firms are opting for increases, led by market leaders often with speciality products, as commodities and transport costs soar due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a weakening yen makes fuel and imports costly. Vixen Co Ltd, which commands nearly 60% of the local market for astronomy telescopes, plans to increase prices of its best selling lower-end models by as much as 24% from next month, to 74,800-169,840 yen ($650-$1,500). ""If costs go up and we don't increase the prices, it will have a big impact on us, so we had to start there,"" spokesperson Yasuhisa Tsuzuki said, adding Vixen had also been impacted by rising wages in China where it manufactures. So far, there has not been a consumer backlash, he said. ""Few people care when the price of an astronomy telescope goes up,"" Tsuzuki said. ""But a hike in the cost of milk or eggs will be reported as big story on every single news show."" Tokyo-based Shirakawa Sogyo Co Ltd, which has been importing and selling violins since the 1960s, this month raised prices of some Swiss-made bows by as much as 36%, to up to 539,000 yen. A strengthening Swiss franc against the yen has added to the squeeze on already tight profit margins, company President Susumu Shirakawa said. Now may be an ""easier time"" to raise prices because costs are generally going up for everyone, he said. ""Some of our competitors are doing it as well."" CAUTIOUS HIKES Goods sold to other businesses are seeing bigger price increases than those sold directly to consumers, according to official data. Wholesale inflation, which reflects the prices firms charge each other for goods, rose to a record 9% in November, while the core consumer price index ticked up 0.5% from a year earlier, the highest in nearly two years. Final goods prices rose just 4.6% in November even as raw material costs spiked 74.6%. Retailers, for instance, generally allow food suppliers to hike prices only when the cost of raw materials jumps 20-30%, said Takao Sekine, executive director at Food Marketing Research and Information Center, a Tokyo-based industry think tank. Less than that and food companies are forced to resort to ""shrinkflation"", Sekine said, where they offset costs by making products smaller. Even companies selling directly to other businesses say they are careful about the size of their increases. Nippon Paper Industries Co Ltd, which accounts for around 40% of the domestic paper market excluding cardboard, is raising prices of some products by 5-15% in the next few months. But it is limiting increases to products where it is a market leader, such as the ""gable-top"" cartons used by milk producers, according to spokesperson Tetsuo Egawa. ""It's hard for a company that's not a top player to be the first to raise prices,"" Egawa said. TOUCHY TOPIC Japanese companies often describe price hikes as something they do as a last resort when costs cannot be absorbed by corporate efforts - a euphemism for cost-cutting. Sangetsu Corp raised prices of wallpaper, curtains and flooring materials by around 15% in September, which a spokesperson said was partly on behalf of the industry, to ensure other companies would be able to stay profitable. Top stationery maker Kokuyo Co Ltd raised the price of scissors, staplers and other metal items by around 8% from Jan. 1, but it limited increases to fewer than one out of every six items in its stationery line-up. ""Our internal streamlining could no longer address the rise in steel prices,"" said Hideki Kubo, a spokesperson.

1/12/2022,"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) spoke about a “national divorce” after suggesting that the Democratic Party constitutes a “tyrannical government” that Americans can resist via their right to bear arms. “Democrats, they hate our Second Amendment. Because ultimately the truth is it’s our Second Amendment rights, our right to bear arms, that protects Americans and give us the ability to defend ourselves from a tyrannical government,” Greene said on Tuesday’s episode of “America First,” a right-wing podcast hosted Sebastian Gorka, a former adviser to President Donald Trump. “And I hate to use this language, but Democrats, they’re exactly ― they’re doing exactly what our Founders talked about when they gave us these precious rights that we have.” “No one wants violence, and I say all the time I am not a violent person,” Greene added. “I hope to never see a civil war in this country, and that’s why you hear me toss around ‘national divorce.’” The extreme rhetoric was nothing new for the lawmaker, who was stripped of her committee assignments last year over her rhetoric about executing prominent Democrats and her embrace of harmful conspiracy theories. While advocating against gun reform in 2019, she publicly harassed a survivor of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting who has fought for stricter gun control after 17 adults and children were massacred in 2018. Greene has expressed support for conspiracy theories that the Parkland massacre was a “false flag” operation to push for tighter gun laws. She previously threw around the idea of a “national divorce” in a December tweet. Her personal Twitter account has since been permanently suspended over her repeated violations of the platform’s COVID-19 misinformation policy.

1/12/2022,"Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) on Tuesday debunked a Capitol riot conspiracy theory backed by Fox News host Tucker Carlson that’s become increasingly popular in right-wing circles. “I know this will break some hearts. For a few months, people like Tucker Carlson, MTG, Gaetz, and now Cruz have been ‘just asking questions’ about a man named Ray Epps,” Kinzinger wrote on Twitter, referring to Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). Epps was seen on camera on Jan. 5, 2021, urging Donald Trump supporters to go into the U.S. Capitol, one day before the Jan. 6 attack on Congress. “Some in the crowd chanted ‘fed fed fed,’” Kinzinger noted. “Why? Who knows, maybe they knew he was videoed talking about breaking into the Capitol the day before it was to happen and wanted to create distance?” Because he wasn’t arrested ― and because he was initially on an FBI “wanted” list and then removed ― Carlson and others have suggested he’s an FBI operative and part of a “false flag” operation at the Capitol. Cruz ― fresh off an appearance on Carlson’s show critics described as “groveling” to the Fox News host ― used his time during a hearing on Tuesday to ask an FBI official about Epps. But Kinzinger wrote in a series of tweets that Epp has spoken with the House select committee investigating the Capitol riot and there’s another reason he was removed from the wanted list, never arrested and never charged: “While it may break hearts, it’s true,” Kinzinger added. “So many are misled by so few. Just look up.” Kinzinger also included a statement from a spokesperson for the committee... and added a note of his own aimed at Cruz: One more @tedcruz conspiracy down. Ray Epps has cooperated and is nothing but a Jan 6 protest attendee, in his own words.
