3/23/2022,"Looks like it’s Amish season again. Sure as the kohlrabi fattens every summer and the cattle ripen on the vine, there comes a time every few years when the television schedules fill with tales of ordinary people eager to throw off the yoke of late western capitalism and try to find deeper fulfilment by disturbing the nearest peaceful Anabaptist sect and refusing to adapt to its ways. In the past we have had Living with the Amish (and various similar titles), How to Get to Heaven With the Hutterites and affiliated documentaries such as Inside the Bruderhof, all set up to show us the error of our overstuffed, consumerist ways. Welcome, this time, to The Simpler Life (Channel 4). Here, 24 Britons from young to middle age are taken off to Devon to live for six months on a 16-hectare farm under the rule of Ohioans Edna and Lloyd Miller, without mains electricity or gas, without food beyond that which they grow themselves – or find in the store cupboard – and withoutany control over what happens to them in the edit. The stupid, unnecessary gloss that is put on the endeavour is that this is a Bold Scientific Experiment (designed by California psychologist Prof Barry Schwartz) to find out whether hateful people who don’t like to work are better at arable farming without power and building a community with two dozen strangers than those who are reasonable human beings and have a semblance of a clue what a day’s graft means. Or not. Honestly, it’s such meretricious nonsense you have to laugh. For God’s sake, it’s 2022, we’re 800 years into a pandemic, 72 hours away from World War III, and the planet is burning. Just point the cameras at the screen fodder and let us watch them for an hour trying to live without electricity and Nando’s. Our first heroes are the double act Jamie (a twentysomething GP receptionist) and his friend Jerome (an NHS administrator). Jamie has never left the city before and expresses some anxieties about the forthcoming endeavour, especially the livestock element. “Are you fearful of a chicken?” asks Jerome. Not in the singular, Jamie avers. “But if 10 are running at you – it’s a no-go.” The first villain is former footballers’ PA Penny. She is baffled by the introductory talk from Lloyd about the Amish philosophy of thinking and working collectively, and putting the group before the individual. “You’ve got to put yourself first, surely?” she says to the questing camera afterwards. “No, you don’t,” says younger daughter Azara. “I agree with them so much,” says older daughter Dilara. Again, we remind ourselves that everything depends on the edit. But it does appear, as time goes on, that Penny gives them much to work with. She hasn’t been there five minutes before she demands to go to the shops rather than eat out of the store cupboard (“There’s absolutely nothing here!” she wails, amid shelves groaning with tinned goods and jars of preserves), while they wait for the first crops to come in, and insists that her kids are starving, and generally seems set fair to do schmugger all other than make a prannet of herself (these are Amish terms that I just made up) for the next six months. We are solemnly informed that on the psychoblimpblomp tests that all the participants took before starting the project, Penny scored low on “agreeableness” and optimism, very low on “need to be part of a group” and high on “desire for power”. Amazing. After that, it’s like every other one of these shows you’ve ever seen. “Some of the work is divided by pre-modern gender roles,” says the voiceover, which is a way of saying that any return to simplicity is generally dependent on the women being shuttled back into the home for a tediously repetitive round of handwashing clothes and dishes, and making – without any mod cons – enormous group meals three times a day. IT project manager Fran takes pride in keeping people happy but notes that she doesn’t know what is happening on the farm because she never has time to go outside. “I’m a human, lonely dishwasher,” she says. While this invisible and untelegenic labour goes, endlessly, on, almost literally behind every scene, we focus on the fine, visibly productive and rewarding life the men have – learning to farm, raise barns and returning home to the delicious meals that have appeared as if by magic. What can you say? It’s fun to watch. We’ve seen it all before. It tells us nothing new. Nice people, it turns out, gonna nice. Shitebags gonna shitebag. Some life lessons will be professed to have been learned by the end of the six-part series. Maybe Penny will score higher in her agreeableness test at the end, or maybe they’ll kill her and bury her under the kohlrabi. I can’t say I care either way.

3/23/2022,"Rishi Sunak will promise “security” to cash-strapped families as he announces a fresh package of measures to tackle the cost of living crisis on Wednesday, but will continue to underline the importance of fixing the public finances. The chancellor has been under intense pressure to take action to help households with the rocketing cost of fuel and other essentials. The financial expert Martin Lewis told MPs on Tuesday that many households are facing a “fiscal punch in the face” when the energy price cap rises next month. Sunak is widely expected to use his update on the economy to announce a cut in fuel duty of at least 5p a litre, but hinted on Tuesday night that he might come up with a more extensive package of support, saying he would “stand by” hard-working families. Options open to him include raising the threshold at which workers start paying national insurance contributions (NICs), deferring the 1.25-point NICs increase for employers and employees, uprating state benefits in line with the 8% inflation rate expected for April, and providing help to energy-intensive businesses. The NICs increase, which is earmarked for health and social care, is loathed by many of the chancellor’s Tory colleagues, including some cabinet ministers, who would like to see it scrapped. However, Sunak and the prime minister signed a joint op-ed in January insisting it was “the right plan”. Raising the threshold at which it starts to be paid, which will stand at £9,880 from April, closer to the personal allowance of £12,570 that applies to income tax, would exempt lower earners, a move likely to be popular with Sunak’s party. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, accused the chancellor of introducing the controversial tax rise to give himself the scope to promise tax cuts ahead of the next general election. “What the chancellor, I think, is doing here is introducing a tax that doesn’t need to be introduced, that’s really going to hurt people, and he’s not doing that for good economic reasons, he’s doing that – he hopes – so that just before the election he can cut taxes and claim to be a tax-cutting government. That is cynical. It’s not the right economic answer; it is cynicism,” he told the BBC’s The World at One. A fuel duty cut has been demanded by many Conservative backbenchers, as prices at the pump have soared in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. However, critics have warned that it is not the best way of helping those hardest hit by the cost of living crisis. Ryan Shorthouse, chief executive of the Conservative thinktank Bright Blue, said: “The fairest way to support the broadest range of struggling households is to increase broad subsidies such as universal credit or cut broad taxes, such as national insurance, income tax or VAT.” He added that a fuel duty cut would be “poorly targeted, since fewer than half of the poorest 20% of households have a car”. Sunak’s statement comes against the backdrop of mounting public concern about the economic outlook. In a new YouGov poll published on Tuesday, almost two-thirds of respondents (63%), including 40% of Conservative voters, said the government is handling the economy badly. The statement was originally planned to be simply an update on the prospects for the economy and the public finances, but has been turned by the war in eastern Europe into the latest of a string of mini-budgets. In pre-released extracts of his speech, Sunak portrays the spring statement as part of the war effort against Russia, saying: “We will confront this challenge to our values not just in the arms and resources we send to Ukraine but in strengthening our economy here at home.” That includes “security for working families as we help with the cost of living,” he says, as well as “the security of more resilient public finances”. Official figures released on Tuesday showed in the first 11 months of the current financial year the state borrowed £26bn less than had been predicted by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in October. The OBR will set out updated forecasts on Wednesday that are likely to point to the potential damage to the economy from the war in Ukraine. Sunak released a series of glossy pictures of himself preparing for the statement on Tuesday, including standing over a long table with the 24 pages of what appeared to be his speech laid out on it. He was derided by Labour for a tweet that said: “Delivering greater economic security for our people, accelerating growth and productivity, and making sure the proceeds of that growth are shared fairly. That is not the work of any one statement. But that work begins tomorrow.” A Labour spokesperson said: “The Conservatives have been in power for 12 years, not 12 days. After presiding over weak economic growth for more than a decade and raising the tax burden to levels not seen for 70 years, how can the chancellor talk about the work only starting now?”",News/Politics,Rishi Sunak to promise ‘security for working families’ in spring statement,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/22/rishi-sunak-cost-of-living-crisis-energy-bills-spring-statement
3/23/2022,"Paris Saint-Germain’s record goalscorer, Marie-Antoinette Katoto, showed her class yet again as she scored twice to help the French side secure a narrow victory against Bayern Munich in their Women’s Champions League quarter-final first leg. Katoto struck either side of half-time at the Allianz Arena, with Klara Bühl getting one back for the hosts with via an 83rd-minute free-kick. That goal could prove crucial in the second leg at the Parc des Princes next week but for now PSG will feel they are in the driving seat after an excellent away win in Germany. Bayern had started brightly in front of a crowd of 13,000 but fell behind on 19 minutes when Katoto thundered a shot into the roof of the net after Kadidiatou Diani’s effort had struck the crossbar. Bayern fought back and came close to equalising through the substitute Sydney Lohmann but then suffered the sucker punch of conceding another Katoto goal, with the 23-year-old climbing high on 71 minutes to head Sandy Baltimore’s corner past the goalkeeper Janina Leitzig. Lohmann again went close to scoring before Bühl finally did beat Barbora Votikova in the PSG goal via a powerfully taken set-piece. “We are very happy with the win, it was a tough game for us against a really good Bayern side,” the PSG defender Amanda Ilestedt said. “We were really efficient, we took our chances and then we were really working hard for each other.” Bayern will need to end PSG’s excellent record in the Champions League so far this season if they are to progress to the semi-finals, with the French champions having won each of the seven games they have played in Paris in the competition. “I think we were the better team in the first half, and were very active down the wings but lacked that final touch,” the Bayern head coach, Jens Scheuer, said. “We delivered a fantastic performance. We were a bit unlucky.”",Sport/Football,Katoto doubles up to give PSG edge over Bayern in Women’s Champions League,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/22/marie-antoinette-katoto-doubles-up-to-give-psg-the-advantage-over-bayern
