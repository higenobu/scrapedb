4/15/2022,"The dueling defamation case between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard dug further into the heart of an often toxic and violent relationship on Thursday as jurors heard from the couple’s marriage counsellor and Heard’s former personal assistant. Dr Laurel Anderson, who was employed by Depp and Heard as a counsellor to discuss their relationship, described “mutual abuse” between the two. She said that, on more than one occasion, Heard had initiated incidents to stop Depp leaving, stemming from her fear of abandonment, according to Anderson. She also said she had seen photos of Heard with bruises. “It was a point of pride to Heard, if she felt disrespected, to initiate a fight,” Anderson said. “If he was going to leave her to de-escalate a fight, she would strike him to keep him there. She would rather be in a fight to keep him there.” Meanwhile, Kate James, Amber Heard’s former personal assistant, testified that Heard “felt she had the right to spit in my face” when James asked for a salary increase. She claimed Heard was taking prescription stimulant drugs, sometimes appeared intoxicated, and had a “kick-the-dog kind of relationship” with her sister, Whitney Heard. Heard, she said, often exhibited “manic episodes … similar to if someone was on some kind of amphetamine drug. Moving fast, not making a lot of sense. Hyper-organizing.” James said Heard also became “belligerent and abusive”, would scream at her over the phone, and send abusive text messages at all times of day. “All incoherent. I was just someone to lash out at.” James also testified that Heard had discussed with her taking psychedelic mushrooms, ecstasy and cocaine, and sometimes appeared under the influence of illegal drugs. “Disorientated, partying with friends, lots of heavy drinking, dancing, laughing, playing … all the sorts of things that go hand in hand with drugs,” James said. After police were called following a 21 May 2016 argument at their downtown Los Angeles home, James added, she received an “emergency call” to meet her boss at the Chateau Marmont hotel. She found Heard with four girlfriends who, she said, had spent the day drinking by the pool, James testified. “It seemed a little conspiratorial to me, kind of like a strategy meeting. She’d made it seem like an emergency but it seemed like a pool party.” James, in a video deposition, further added that Heard told her she didn’t enjoy hanging out with her husband’s friends because they were “boring and all old men playing guitars and it wasn’t interesting to her”. James also made no effort to conceal her admiration for Depp, whom she described as “peaceful, calm, shy and almost quiet … he’s such a gentleman, a total southern gentleman”. Coming four days into the trial, James’s testimony marks an escalation in Depp’s legal effort, which has so far been to paint Heard as a schemer who concocted accusations of his abuse against her, and then attempted to hitch those to the #MeToo movement in a Washington Post opinion article which forms the basis of the current defamation case. Much of the former assistant’s testimony to the court in Fairfax, Virginia, was previewed at London’s Royal Courts of Justice last year when James gave evidence that Heard had appropriated her story of being a “sexual violence survivor” during Depp’s unsuccessful libel action against the publisher of the Sun newspaper, after it termed him a “wife-beater”. In that case, James said that Heard had appropriated James’s own experience of being violently raped at machete point in Brazil. “She twisted it into her own story and she used it for her own use,” she said. Efforts by Depp’s legal team to disparage Heard and dismantle her credibility have also come at cost for the actor. In text messages shown to the court a day earlier, the actor referred to her as a “rotting corpse”.",Arts/Film,Jury in Johnny Depp-Amber Heard defamation case hears of ‘mutual abuse’,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/14/johnny-depp-amber-heard-defamation-trial-mutual-abuse
4/15/2022,"When Boris Johnson’s position was at its most precarious two months ago, he had to convince Conservative MPs sticking by his side was worth it. A plan was devised – dubbed “Operation Red Meat” – to give those losing faith in his administration some belief that there was a higher purpose than just defending their leader through scandal after scandal. The prime minister knew he needed to shore up support, prove himself a proper conservative and enact more of the policies that saw him clinch an 80-seat majority at the last election. A major theme of the Tories’ campaign in 2019 was Brexit – and in the years since, Johnson has been mindful that the message about “taking back control of our borders” was particularly potent for some. Senior advisers have been keen to ensure the voters who swung from Labour to the Conservatives – often via Ukip and the Brexit party – end up sticking with Johnson at the next election. As such, it was with much fanfare that Johnson wanted to announce a tough new immigration policy designed at deterring migrants from making the perilous journey across the Channel from France via “irregular” routes. But while it came as welcome news to many Tory MPs, there are still concerns about the detail: the cost and the choice of Rwanda as the country where some asylum seekers will be sent. Just last month, Conservative peer Lord Kirkhope warned that “the costs of offshoring would be exorbitant”, citing “conservative estimates” of around £2m per person a year. So far, just £120m has been committed by the UK government to fund the scheme. Despite repeated promises from home secretary Priti Patel to bring the numbers down, they remain at their highest on-record: 4,600 people have arrived on small boats on the Kent coast this year, with about 600 in a single day earlier this week – and “hundreds” more on Thursday. The failure to get the numbers down came up in one-to-ones Johnson held with wobbling MPs when he was in his famed “listening mode” at the end of January. His ear was bent repeatedly about the issue, not only by people who thought the government should take stronger action to end the arrival of migrants on small boats, but also those who believed it was a helpful subject to be dominating the political agenda. The Conservatives have risked being outflanked on traditional turf, such as law and order, but know that the subject of border controls allows them to more easily exploit the old divisions of the Brexit years – and try to paint Labour as soft on immigration. While one Conservative MP, Andrew Mitchell, has expressed concern about the plan, many more in the party were celebrating that they could finally appear to be tackling irregular migration. “We’ve been waiting ages for action like this,” a “red wall” Tory MP supportive of the policy admitted. Government insiders said they had been hoping to announce it months ago, to try moving attention away from the original partygate scandal. And Johnson was said to have pushed hard for it to be announced before the local elections, when many Conservatives worry they will be thumped over the fines and ongoing police probe into law-breaking parties in Downing Street. Rwanda’s human rights record has also prompted concern – given the UK does take in refugees who say they are fleeing the threat of persecution in the very same country. Finally, there is the issue of whether the tough talk will translate into a dramatic reduction in the number of people crossing the Channel, or simply draw attention to an issue the government has so far appeared unable to solve. The government’s own refugee minister, Richard Harrington, hinted at this last week, admitting: “I’m having difficulty enough getting them from Ukraine to our country, there’s no possibility of sending them to Rwanda.” Some Tory insiders fear this is just another sticking plaster solution – and that over-promising and under-delivering will be more damaging for the party in the longer term.",News/UK news,What are the Tories trying to achieve by offshoring asylum seekers?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/14/what-are-the-tories-trying-to-achieve-by-offshoring-asylum-seekers
4/15/2022,"International agencies saw their influence wane after the 2008 financial crash as the support for multilateral agreements gave way to quick-fix solutions between governments. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which hold their joint spring meetings next week, have suffered like many others. So when the IMF boss, Kristalina Georgieva, wags a finger at the major central banks – the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the People’s Bank of China, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England – the question is: are any of them listening? After a flirtation with austerity in 2009 and 2010, IMF officials largely rejected cuts in government spending as a route to growth but it was a message that went unheeded in most major capitals. The Washington-based organisation has produced reams of literature arguing that inequality is bad economics and that climate change is an emergency, only to be met by loud applause and little in the way of action. Georgieva said on Thursday in a scene-setting speech that inflation “is a threat to financial stability and a tax on ordinary people struggling to make ends meet”. She subscribes to the orthodox view that central banks should take “decisive action”, which is a euphemism for jacking up interest rates. She also warned them to be careful about the spillover effects and urged governments to mitigate the impact on those countries that have to borrow to survive. While developed countries are suffering from spiralling inflation and higher interest rates, the biggest threat is to emerging and developing economies that not only face “the added risk of higher borrowing costs but also the risk of capital outflows”. But is anyone taking notice? Zambia, Chad, Ethiopia and Sri Lanka head a long list of countries that have already found it impossible to finance their debts. Many of them owe money to foreign investors that buy distressed government debt via institutions such as BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager. There could be deals next week brokered by the IMF, the World Bank and ministers sitting on the G20 board to alleviate current debt payments, but the outcome will probably mean existing loans provided by western governments, or the IMF and World Bank themselves, are rescheduled over a longer time period. No one is expecting a confrontation with private lenders. Such small steps are not enough. These countries should have a proportion of their debts written off. And not just by public bodies, but by all lenders, which must be forced to concede, much as high street banks are forced to do, that when a borrowers’ circumstances have changed, sometimes long after the original loans were made, repayments on whatever basis will prevent a sustainable recovery. Residential property rents are soaring in the UK and so are property values: two trends that have been increasing the costs of bringing up a family ever since the 2008 financial crash. Whether you buy a house or rent, the cost has been increasing for some time. Ultra-low mortgages have encouraged the trend, enticing young people to take on larger home loans stretched over 30 years or more. Taking a global view, a decade-long property boom has doubled the value of the real estate market to reach $350tn (£270tn), four times the size of the $90tn global economy. More than 80% of global investment is in property. Dhaval Joshi, the chief European strategist of BCA Research, describes that incredible wealth stored in the housing market as “eyewatering”. It’s not just Brits. Everyone is betting on the same thing. During this unprecedented boom, investors have extracted massive gains. Rents on average are up 40% globally over the last 10 years. Can it keep going? Will young people keep working to pay the ever increasing rent/mortgage bills? All eyes are on the central banks and whether they keep raising interest rates. If they do, that may tip the balance. It’s not clear why Elon Musk wants to buy Twitter. He says it would be a better company if it were privately owned by him. It is not making the best of the opportunities open to it, he said, adding in a letter to the board that the company is “the platform for free speech around the world” but cannot achieve this “societal imperative” in its current form and “needs to be transformed as a private company”. One thing is for sure, he has put Twitter in play as a takeover target. Mark Cuban, the maverick US financier, says some of the big tech companies that are swimming in cash – Google, Amazon, Facebook - will consider a buyout. At at a cost north of $43bn, that looks unlikely.",News/Business,IMF wags its finger at central banks – but are they listening? | Phillip Inman,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/14/imf-wags-its-finger-at-central-banks-but-are-they-listening
4/15/2022,"A Greek pilot accused of murdering his British wife, Caroline Crouch, as she slept in their Athens home, exerted “extreme control” over her, a court has heard. On day three of a murder trial that has gripped the nation, Eleni Mylonopoulou, a counsellor who had seen the pair over several months for couples counselling, testified that the young Briton had fallen victim to an “extremely manipulative” man. Babis Anagnostopoulos, 34, who has admitted strangling Crouch, 20, in the presence of their baby daughter on 11 May last year, was very aware of his actions, she told judges and jurors in court. “The behaviour of the accused towards Caroline was extremely manipulative, extremely controlling,” said the counsellor, describing a marriage that had become increasingly abusive. “Very often Caroline didn’t understand herself … she would be closed in the house for days alone.” Mylonopoulou, whose prolonged testimony dominated a dramatic day of proceedings, told the court it was clear to her that Crouch had been desperate to leave Anagnostopoulos, whom she had met as a teenager on Alonissos, the island where she was raised. “From the very first session, the 20-year-old had confided that she wanted to take the child and leave,” she said, explaining that Crouch had complained of often being left without any means to even shop. “Her mother would send her money and he would take it … she didn’t even have five euros on her. She wanted to go to a pastry school but she didn’t have the money to attend. She couldn’t move about. Everything had to happen with a taxi driver friend of the accused … when a person is manipulative like the accused he wants at any moment to know where the other is.” The counsellor said she had seen the couple a dozen times before receiving written notice from Anagnostopoulos, abruptly ending the sessions. For nearly six weeks, the helicopter pilot attempted to blame the murder on a botched burglary by “foreign” thieves. In a rare move, Greek authorities announced a €300,000 reward for information that might lead to the assailants. When it did eventually come, his confession convulsed the nation. Crouch was among 17 women in Greece last year to be killed by their partners. The defendant, who also admitted killing Caroline’s seven-month-old puppy in an attempt to make his claim of a violent burglary appear more realistic, stands accused of pre-meditated murder, animal abuse and lying to police – charges that could mean life in prison. Fourteen prosecution witnesses are expected to take the stand. Since the trial’s opening, Anagnostopoulos, who claims he committed the crime in “a blurred state of mind”, has personally questioned several of the witnesses as part of a strategy aimed at proving the murder had not been planned. If he is able to convince the court, his sentence could be reduced. Cross-examining the counsellor – as allowed under Greek law – he attempted on Thursday to quash the claim he had been manipulative and controlling. Mylonopoulou, who was forced to verbally spar with the man she once counselled, told the court she was so convinced that Anagnostopoulos had committed the crime when news of the murder broke that she had called her lawyer to say as much. The giveaway, she said, was the death of Caroline’s dog, Roxy. “Caroline adored that dog. To kill it first was symbolic. And Caroline was asleep. He killed her in her sleep. He had her in his hands. The life was drained from her in his hands,” she said, describing the manner of the Briton’s death as controlling in itself. “He could feel [her dying] and he murdered her. He also exhibited abusive behaviour towards the child, which he placed next to her mother’s dead body … a baby has a special relationship with her mother, which he abused, putting her next to the lifeless body of her mother.”",News/World news,"Caroline Crouch: Greek pilot accused of murder was controlling, says counsellor",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/caroline-crouch-greek-pilot-accused-of-was-controlling-says-counsellor
4/15/2022,"Priti Patel’s ambition to send asylum seekers as far away from the UK mainland as she can has a history. Two years ago, the home secretary looked at shipping Channel migrants to processing centres from north Africa to the South Atlantic. Those ideas eventually bit the dust, on grounds that included the scheme’s inhumanity, impracticability and eye-watering costs. But Ms Patel has never been one to let the facts get in the way of a wicked idea. On Thursday, the home secretary announced in Kigali that, in return for £120m of development aid, Rwanda will accept the transfer of UK asylum seekers. This is a much more sweeping approach, since it apparently involves no asylum claim processing. That makes it simply an expulsion exercise, which, apart from any other objections, carries many colonial-era echoes. Although Rwanda was described by Boris Johnson as a dynamic country and one of the world’s safest, it was condemned only this week by the US state department as a country with “significant human rights issues”, which include arbitrary killings and detentions, forced disappearances, and harsh and life-threatening prison conditions. A similar policy in Rwanda run by Israel fell apart in 2017 when only nine of about 4,000 deportees were found to have remained there. It is far from clear that this latest example of Ms Patel’s addiction to the politics of performative cruelty will in fact be put into practice, let alone happen – or be effective – on a large scale. The significance of Thursday’s announcement was as much in its cynical timing as in its cold-hearted substance. Mr Johnson is being hammered again by the unpopularity of his Downing Street pandemic lawbreaking and fines. His party is facing serious losses in the local elections in three weeks’ time because of it. The chances of a vote of confidence against him are rising again. For the prime minister, a headline-grabbing crackdown initiative on immigration provides a media distraction, a chance to rally his anti-immigration voters before the local elections, and puts pressure on the MPs and peers who are still blocking asylum law changes in the government’s immigration and borders bill. There is no disputing that the dangerous and inhumane people-smuggling operations in the Channel need to be gripped and controlled more effectively. Nor is there doubt, as spring turns to summer, that numbers are likely to go on rising; more than 28,500 made the crossing in 2021, and the Home Office is reported to expect the figure to double this year. But the answer to that challenge is not for the UK military to seize the migrants, load them in planes, send them to east Africa on a one-way flight and forget about them. That approach is objectionable on multiple grounds. It is expensive, inhumane, at odds with this country’s history of commitment to refugees, likely to prove illegal and unlikely to be the deterrent that Ms Patel hopes. It is a racist measure; it seems unlikely that a white Ukrainian asylum seeker arriving in Britain would ever be sent to Rwanda. It is also not as popular as some assume; a snap poll on Thursday showed that a majority of voters oppose the scheme. The answer, as always, must be a pragmatic and just approach. It should be to work with France and other European neighbours more thoroughly to process claims better and more fairly, and to make deals for the return of those who do not qualify. This government, though, shows little sign of wanting to do that. The abject truth is that Mr Johnson and Ms Patel prefer to stage a row about asylum seekers than to join with other states and charities to address the global, criminal and humanitarian issues that are causing so much suffering.",Opinion/Opinion,"The Guardian view on Britain’s Rwanda deal: a cruel, cynical pretence | Editorial",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/14/the-guardian-view-on-britains-rwanda-deal-a-cruel-cynical-pretence
4/15/2022,"The idea that Christians should respond to, and sometimes learn from, secular movements was a feature of the modernising wave that swept through the Catholic church in the 1960s. In his 1963 encyclical letter, Pacem in Terris, Pope John Paul XXIII identified the growing role of women in public life and the end of colonialism as two progressive developments carrying a religious, eschatological significance. Sixty or so years later, as it seeks to deal with contemporary “signs of the times”, certain sections of the Church of England are struggling to show a similar openness and humility. Last month, an ecclesiastical court refused to grant a request by Jesus College, Cambridge, to remove a memorial plaque from its chapel to Tobias Rustat – a 17th-century slave trader and notable benefactor to the college. The petition was led by Sonita Alleyne, the first black master of an Oxbridge college, who said that the memorial’s presence was having a negative impact on worship in the chapel and alienating a diverse student body. As the Anglican communion seeks to atone for historic links to the transatlantic slave trade, here was an opportunity to demonstrate that penitence and reflection could lead to concrete action. To the very public dismay and anger of Archbishop Justin Welby – who on Wednesday reiterated his support for Ms Alleyne’s request – this test case was flunked on the most spurious and disingenuous grounds. Justifying his verdict, a judge at the consistory court of the diocese of Ely said that Rustat’s energetic involvement in two slave-trading companies was not a major source of his great wealth. This irrelevant consideration was supplemented by a suggestion that images of Christ on the cross indicated that a church was not intended as a “comfortable” space. As a trolling aside, the Worshipful David Hodge QC added that the Rustat memorial could help members of the congregation to reflect on the flawed nature of humanity and their own sinfulness. Given the likely cost, which it can ill afford, Jesus College has announced that it will not appeal this wrongheaded decision. The powerful group of alumni and traditionalists who contested the memorial’s removal will celebrate a landmark victory against “cancel culture” (although the intention was to relocate it elsewhere in the college). But the reality is that this episode is a dismal setback for a church that knows it must better reflect and respect the experience and perspectives of its membership. Ms Alleyne has pointed out that the average Anglican in the worldwide communion is now a 30-year-old black woman. More than a third of Jesus College students now come from a minority ethnic background; that some should feel unhappy worshipping under a memorial to a slave trader is hardly surprising. In 2020, after the murder of George Floyd and the emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement, the Church of England set up an anti-racism taskforce to examine issues of diversity, race and inclusion. Its scathing report, entitled From Lament to Action, highlighted the need for the church to confront historic connections with slavery. The continuing presence of the Rustat memorial in the Jesus College chapel grievously undermines this necessary work.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the Church of England and Jesus College: misreading history | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/14/the-guardian-view-on-the-church-of-england-and-jesus-college-misreading-history
4/15/2022,"An archaeological dig under Notre Dame Cathedral has uncovered an extraordinary treasure of statues, sculptures, tombs and pieces of an original rood screen dating back to the 13th century. The find included several ancient tombs from the middle ages and a body-shaped lead sarcophagus buried at the heart of the fire-ravaged monument under the floor of the transept crossing. French experts have described the discovery as “extraordinary and emotional”. “We uncovered all these riches just 10-15cm under the floor slabs. It was completely unexpected. There were exceptional pieces documenting the history of the monument,” said Christophe Besnier, who headed the scientific team for the dig. “It was an emotional moment. Suddenly we had several hundred pieces from small fragments to large blocks including sculpted hands, feet, faces, architectural decorations and plants. Some of the pieces were still coloured.” The discovery was revealed by France’s national archaeological institute, Inrap, on Thursday. A team from the institute was called in to carry out a “preventive dig” under a section of the cathedral floor between February and April before a 100ft-high 600-tonne scaffold was built to reconstruct the monument’s spire. Until now, only a few pieces of the original Notre Dame rood screen, an ornate partition between the chancel and nave that separated the clergy and choir from the congregation, have remained. Some of these are in the cathedral store rooms, while others are on show in the Louvre. In Catholic churches, most were removed during the Counter-Reformation in the 16th and 17th centuries. The rest of the Notre Dame rood appears to have been carefully interred under the cathedral floor during the building’s restoration by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc – who added the spire – in the mid-19th century. One of the most extraordinary pieces was an intact sculpture of the head of a man, believed to be a representation of Jesus, carved from stone. Another block from the rood screen, believed to date from the 13th century, shows a Gothic-style monument. The Inrap team was given a strict timeframe and only a specific area in which to carry out the excavation. After fire swept through the 850-year-old cathedral, one of Paris’s most symbolic and visited monuments, in April 2019, almost destroying the entire edifice, President Emmanuel Macron pledged to have it rebuilt and open for mass in five years. Last September, Gen Jean-Louis Georgelin, appointed to oversee the restoration, said the safety of the cathedral structure had been established, meaning the restoration and reconstruction of the sections destroyed by fire could begin. He said the cathedral would be open for services and public visits as promised in 2024. Besnier said they had identified several other slabs of the rood screen under the floor, but these were outside the specified limit of the dig. “We know they are there and won’t be damaged. Hopefully, we will be able to uncover them at a later date,” he said. The excavation also unveiled a network of masonry heating pipes installed under the floor in the 19th century. Experts believe the lead sarcophagus may contain the body of a high church official possibly dating back to the 14th century. A camera introduced into the coffin had revealed plant remains under the head of the deceased alongside hair and fragments of cloth, but there was no plate identifying the occupant. Dominique Garcia, president of Inrap, said further examinations including DNA tests would be carried out, but added: “A sarcophagus containing a human body is not an archaeological object. These are human remains, and while examining the sarcophagus and analysing the body and other objects inside, we must do so with respect.” He said no decision had been made as to where the body would be reburied once the tests had been completed. “It’s too early to say. It’s possible that it will be reburied somewhere in the cathedral.”",News/World news,‘Extraordinary’: ancient tombs and statues unearthed beneath Notre Dame Cathedral,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/ancient-tombs-statues-notre-dame-cathedral-archaeological-dig
4/15/2022,"Humanity isn’t the Home Office’s strongest suit. But then, neither is communication. Last week Richard Harrington, the refugees minister, was asked by the broadcaster LBC if the government had any plans to offshore refugees to Rwanda. He replied with an unambiguous no. He had no clue where such an idea might have come from. No one in the Home Office had discussed anything like this with him. It was a non-story; scare tactics from paranoid liberals trying to discredit Priti Patel. Not that the home secretary needs any help. She never fails to discredit herself. Cue 10 days later and Boris Johnson was at a hangar in Lydd, Kent, to announce what he tried to convince a few bored service personnel and a handful of sceptical hacks was the new outpost of Butlin’s in Kigali. A pleasure palace for refugees more than 5,000 miles away. In a country where the problem was well out of sight of British eyes. God forbid that any Brits might have to encounter desperate people fleeing war and persecution. Some had thought the timing was all a bit too convenient. After days of bad headlines about the prime minister’s own criminality, a chance to move things on with a policy that would go down a storm with red wall Tory voters before the May local elections and piss off just about everyone with a moral conscience. It was that cynical. All the more so because the Kigali hostel could well remain empty for years as civil rights lawyers take the government to court for acting illegally. The Potemkin Pleasuredome. But the reality was that it was more like killing two birds with one stone. Sure, it was good to talk about something other than Partygate, but the Convict and Patel had genuinely been working on the deranged plan for months, despite the best efforts of civil servants to talk them out of it, and were finally ready to put their idiocy and cruelty on view. And still no one had thought to keep Lord Harrington in the loop. Johnson started with the usual waffle. The stuff he needs to tell himself each morning so he can drag himself out of his bed and look in the mirror. Somehow he has to find a way of convincing himself he’s a decent man. Not some lying narcissist who will do and say anything to get him through the day relatively unscathed. So he mumbled something about Britain’s fine history of openness and generosity to refugees. Er, hello. We took just 9,000 children in the Kindertransport. And only made a big fuss about congratulating ourselves for that because we hadn’t taken any adult Jews fleeing Nazi persecution. And then we made almost no plans to take in any Afghan refugees last year after the US withdrawal and had to hastily scoop up a few thousand interpreters and other key workers at the last moment. And even then we seemed more interested in getting pets out of the country rather than people in fear for their lives. So, not so great. A quick reality check. The UK is the fifth or sixth largest economy and takes just 0.2% of the world’s refugees. Then the Convict got down to the nitty gritty. He wanted to stop the trade in people trafficking. But he didn’t want to do it by making it easier for people to claim asylum in the country. At present refugees are stuck in a catch-22. They can only claim asylum once they are in the UK but the only way to get here is illegally. Johnson didn’t want to address that. What he proposed was that any asylum seekers – including Ukrainians without a visa – who reached the UK without having been pushed back and drowned while crossing the Channel would be rounded up by the army and given a one-way ticket to Rwanda. Where they could rot while their applications were processed. And if they were cold, wet and frightened then so much the better. Teach them not to come to the UK. Then things just turned surreal. First, the Convict tried to portray Rwanda as some kind of tropical human rights paradise. Regardless of the fact that it was a dictatorship that the UK had condemned for human rights violations. Then he tried to claim the programme would be a bargain. Ignoring the fact that some Tory MPs had estimated it would be cheaper to put all the refugees up at the Ritz. But he saved the best till last. This was necessary because he was a firm believer in the rule of law. From the man who has shown a spectacular disregard for it since he became prime minister. Keep those fixed-penalty notices coming. Johnson kept the bullshit going when it came to questions. He merely repeated that he was probably treating refugees with too much kindness. Britain would be overwhelmed with asylum seekers desperate to be interned in Rwanda. Maybe he should try to make the new regime more punitive. As for his own criminality, he merely smirked and tugged the toddler haircut. If it was all the same, he would fail to answer the questions sometime next week. He’s taking the whole country for mugs. We have a criminal in No 10 and he refuses to explain himself. The Tory wankocracy in overdive, He also said Rishi Sunak was safe in his job. So that means he’s toast. Rishi must be wishing he had the self-worth to resign. About an hour later, we disappeared through the looking-glass. Here we had Patel, as vicious as she is half-witted, in Kigali. Back in the 70s her parents had fled Idi Amin’s Uganda. Now she was proposing to send terrified refugees to a neighbouring country whose own citizens seek sanctuary elsewhere. Priti Vacant looked a bit glum as she read out all the positives of the programme, but cheered up when she remembered it was all lies and that the refugees would be banged up in a hostel after all.

4/15/2022,"Conservative opposition to plans to send asylum seekers for processing in Rwanda is likely to be led by a small but vehement group of peers and MPs who have already criticised outsourcing the issue overseas. The House of Lords has now twice amended the nationality and borders bill to block the idea of non-UK processing for asylum claims. However, these government defeats were largely caused by Tory members staying away, giving opposition and crossbench peers a majority. When the idea was rejected by peers for a second time earlier this month, only one Conservative actively voted for an amendment to block overseas outsourcing – the former party chair and consistent government critic Sayeeda Warsi. Similarly, when the initial Lords defeat was overturned by the Commons last month, just three Conservative MPs voted against the government – Andrew Mitchell, David Davis and Simon Hoare. Mitchell, the former international development secretary, said on Thursday that he had severe doubts about the Rwanda proposals. “MPs from across the house have already expressed concerns about adopting a policy which Australia abandoned as a failure,” he said. “But this new approach seems to be globally unprecedented and MPs will understandably want to have questions answered about how this is going to work and how much it is going to cost. “How will human rights be protected? How will asylum seekers be able to make claims via safe and legal routes? How long will this arrangement last? How many people will be subjected to this new policy?” Warsi was more damning still, saying the policy was “inhumane and shames our proud history as advocates of human rights and the refugee convention”. The timing of the announcement was “cynical and political”, she added. The nationality and borders bill will be considered by the Commons again, most likely next week. With parliament due to be prorogued soon afterwards before the Queen’s speech on 10 May, it faces a tight timetable, and it cannot be carried over to the next parliamentary session. Priti Patel, the home secretary, and Andrew Griffith, the Tory MP who heads the No 10 policy unit, argued on Thursday that the Rwanda plan could go ahead even without the bill. “My understanding is that this policy can come in immediately,” Griffith told the BBC. “It doesn’t depend on the bill. It’s an agreement that the home secretary is signing today.” While it would be at least a symbolic defeat for ministers if the bill fell, Timothy Kirkhope, a Tory peer who was immigration minister under John Major and who has helped lead opposition in the Lords to overseas processing, said peers were likely to give way. “I think we have to make the assumption that this legislation will go through,” he said. “There will be a lot more remonstrations, but ultimately we have to concede to the elected house.” Kirkhope said that as immigration minister he had examined the issue of offshore processing and rejected it. “It’s impractical, it’s extremely expensive, and it’s subject to legal challenge, including under international law, because I think it is absolutely against the principles of the refugee convention.” His view was echoed by the Adam Smith Institute (ASI), a free-market thinktank that is generally viewed as Conservative-leaning. Emily Fielder, of the ASI, said: “The inhumanity of this policy aside, it will neither deter asylum seekers from crossing the Channel, nor will it cost the government less. Rather than throwing out ineffective red-meat policies, which will cost the British taxpayer millions of pounds, the Home Office should work more constructively with European partners, and focus on evidence-based solutions to reducing dangerous asylum-seeker crossings.”",News/UK news,‘Inhumane’: some Tories criticise plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/14/inhumane-the-tory-critics-of-plan-to-send-asylum-seekers-to-rwanda
4/15/2022,"When my wife died of Covid early in the pandemic, my family and I obeyed Boris Johnson’s laws and rules. I couldn’t see her in hospital, couldn’t hold her hand as she died. Our two daughters and three grandchildren drove 100 miles up the motorway, clutching a letter from the funeral director explaining why they were on the motorway in case they were questioned by the police. We met in the churchyard before the burial and bid tearful farewells there, as we were not allowed to meet in our family home. No service in the church, no other relatives or friends present as only six mourners were allowed. Our son-in-law had to stay at home as he would have been the forbidden seventh mourner. Johnson flouted his own laws and rules. He partied his way through them. Am I angry? Anger doesn’t even touch the sides of how I feel about this pathetic excuse for a man, and I suspect that the majority of us little people share my views, will never forget and will never forgive.John RobinsonLichfield, Staffordshire  I actually cried with anger on reading Michael Fabricant’s assertion that many nurses and teachers probably had a post-work drink in their staffroom. I worked as a midwife on a postnatal ward during the pandemic, and our tiny staffroom, which would normally seat two people, was strictly for the use of one person at a time in order to abide by the two-metre rule. The only place we could eat was the hub set up to provide us with somewhere to have a break, and most of us avoided that for fear of catching Covid. After each shift, we bundled our uniforms into a washable bag and headed home. My husband made me sit in the back seat of the car with all the windows open as he was scared of contracting it. When I reached home, I put the whole washable bag in the washing machine and jumped into the shower before hugging my children, in order to protect them. I am not sure where in this routine Fabricant thinks I might have stopped for a post-work drink.Laura MatthewsWest Wickham, London  My son is an A&E doctor. He worked throughout the pandemic. When he returned home after long and gruelling shifts he stayed in and did not socialise with others, even on his birthday. He did not break the rules. My mother is 93 and lives in sheltered accommodation. Throughout the pandemic she remained isolated and alone, and I did not visit her. She did not break the rules. My wife and I stayed at home apart from exercise. We shopped online. We did not socialise. We did not break the rules. Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak and many others who set the rules and urged everyone else to follow them partied in Downing Street. They broke the rules and broke the law. Entitled, arrogant and out of touch. If they don’t go now they should be turfed out at the next election.Dom FlintSheffield  I take great comfort from the fact that Boris Johnson, family and pals were partying while I was in hospital. At the time, I was emerging from a 40-day coma, bewildered and confused, wondering where I had been. The lovely people in the two hospitals where I was treated knew that my mental state depended on me seeing my wife and family, and so were able to sneak three outdoor encounters under restricted conditions. Looking back on that time, remembering the strange, disconnected and delusional feelings I had, I can at least feel relieved that the folks running the country were having a good time. I’m sure the appallingly low-paid health workers who fought to save my life must feel similarly grateful. How else can we learn to respect our betters?Michael RosenLondon  Last April, a great friend of mine died of Covid in a nursing home. Because of the rules, her husband was not allowed to see her body. Since then he has been very distressed because he thinks his wife has left him. This morning, for the umpteenth time, I said: “That’s not what happened, she died.” And for the first time he put two and two together and said: “That could be why they have been extra nice to me this week.” I don’t know if the new reality will stick. Maybe next week he will go back to believing she is off with her new fancy man, but I fully believe that had the nursing home trashed the rules, as Boris Johnson did, and let him see her body, his remaining life would have been sad, but not in the horrible deserted way that he has been feeling.Margaret SquiresSt Andrews, Fife  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

4/15/2022,"The government has proved once again that it is incapable of thinking beyond the instant headline and ignores presumably unintended but totally predictable consequences of its thoughtlessness (UK to send asylum seekers to Rwanda for processing, 13 April). The intention is to send single men to Rwanda for a biblical 40 years or more. Any people smuggler with a business plan will tell asylum seekers to travel alone, get settled and then bring their families – the least risky strategy. Now they will say: “Bring your families now so that you will not be put on a plane to Rwanda.” The consequence: more children on dangerous boats; more children drowned in the Channel; then another crackpot scheme announced to “solve” the humanitarian disaster caused by the last plan. The way to reduce the problem is to set up legal and accessible ways of claiming asylum abroad and reducing the need for desperate people to attempt desperate routes. That is the way to undermine the people smugglers who are exploiting market opportunities that the government has created. The “war on refugees” is no more winnable than the “war on drugs” that it so resembles in its enthusiastic embrace of folly and its lack of hope of victory, except on the battlefield of soundbites.Mike CushmanLondon  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
