12/22/2021,"By Linda So and Jason Szep (Reuters) - A member of Donald Trump’s 2020 presidential campaign arranged and participated in a meeting at which a Georgia election worker says she was pressed by a Chicago publicist to falsely admit voting fraud. The revelation directly ties a senior figure in the former president’s political operation to an extraordinary late-night Jan. 4 meeting in which a $16-an-hour election worker faced pressure to implicate herself in a baseless conspiracy theory, stoked by Trump himself, as he sought to overturn his Georgia election loss. Harrison Floyd - who was executive director of a national campaign coalition called Black Voices for Trump in 2020 - told Reuters on Monday that he asked Chicago publicist Trevian Kutti to visit the Atlanta area to speak with 62-year-old temporary election worker Ruby Freeman. Floyd said he then participated by phone in a meeting Kutti held with Freeman at a police station in Georgia’s Cobb County. Kutti was accompanied at the meeting by another Trump campaign figure: Garrison Douglas, who was a Georgia leader in Black Voices for Trump during the campaign and now works as a Republican Party spokesperson in the state. Douglas confirmed to Reuters that he was present at the meeting. Floyd said he recruited Douglas and Kutti because he was unable to attend himself. In a statement to Reuters on Monday, Douglas said: ""On January 4th, I was unemployed and received a call to serve as a volunteer driver, as I had many times in the past. I had no involvement in the meeting beyond the task of driving."" In a phone interview Monday, Floyd said he was asked if he’d be willing to set up the meeting by a man he described as a chaplain with “connections” in federal law enforcement. He declined to name the clergyman or to detail what those connections involved. Floyd said the chaplain, who is white, wanted him to approach Freeman, who is Black, to discuss an immunity deal for her, out of a belief that she would not trust a white stranger. Floyd, Douglas and Kutti are Black. Floyd said that he had left his role in the Trump campaign before the Jan. 4 meeting. Trump himself “never asked me to go” to Georgia, he said, and board members of the Black Voices for Trump group “had no involvement in this.” Floyd said he arranged the meeting in an effort to help Freeman. He said he himself believed she was seeking assistance, including immunity from prosecution over claims from the Trump camp that she had committed voting fraud. Freeman, through a spokesperson, said she never reached out to anyone to seek immunity. Her lawyer, Von DuBose, declined to comment further. A former Justice Department official in Georgia confirmed that state and federal investigators concluded in December 2020 that there was no evidence Freeman committed fraud. As a result, the department never considered offering her immunity, said the official, who had direct knowledge of a Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiry into Trump’s Georgia election-fraud claims. Floyd did not directly answer when asked whether Freeman requested immunity at the meeting. He said Freeman wasn’t willing to “put anything down on paper,” so he had nothing to “run up the flagpole,” referring to his more senior contacts in Trump’s political operation. Asked if he told Freeman that he was a Trump campaign official, Floyd said: “I’m pretty certain that I made it clear.” He referred to a comment by Kutti, captured on police bodycam video, telling Freeman that “federal people” were involved in offering her help. “Who was the current president at that time? President Trump,” said Floyd. “If she’s there saying, I’m here to connect you with federal people, well, that’s people in the Trump administration.” Freeman told Reuters in a previous interview that she did not know Kutti was a Trump supporter until after the meeting at the police station, when Freeman researched the publicist online. Kutti and her lawyer, Robert Barker, did not respond to requests for comment. In an Instagram post last Monday, Kutti denied pressuring Freeman to falsely admit fraud. A spokesperson for Trump did not respond to requests for comment for this story. The Republican National Committee, where Douglas is now employed, did not respond to a request for comment. The involvement of Trump campaign figures in the meeting with Freeman highlights the aggressive and unusual steps taken by backers of the former president to help reverse his loss in the once-reliably Republican state. Beginning on Dec. 3 last year, Trump and his allies falsely claimed that video of vote-counting at Atlanta’s State Farm Arena proved that Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, another Fulton County election worker, committed election fraud. They alleged the mother and daughter illegally tabulated mysterious ballots from a suitcase multiple times to create 18,000 fraudulent votes - enough to cause Trump to lose the Georgia election. State and county officials quickly disproved that allegation. The false claims sparked months of death threats and other harassment by Trump supporters toward Freeman and her daughter. The district attorney in Fulton County, where Freeman worked on the ballot count, is conducting a criminal investigation into Trump’s alleged interference in Georgia’s election. The district attorney, Fani Willis, has said the probe would examine a now-famous call in which Trump pressed Georgia officials to “find” him enough votes to overturn his loss in the state. On the call, Trump singled out Freeman by name 18 times, calling her a “professional vote scammer,” a “hustler” and a “known political operative” who “stuffed the ballot boxes.” That call came two days before Floyd dispatched Kutti and Douglas to visit Freeman. BLACK VOICES FOR TRUMP Floyd and Douglas were part of a small but active base of Black political support for Trump. Kutti has worked as a publicist in the music industry and managed the campaign for an unsuccessful Georgia Republican candidate for the U.S. House. Floyd launched a bid for Georgia’s 7th District congressional seat in May 2019 but dropped out less than a month later. That July, he joined Black Voices for Trump as executive director, a position he says he held until Nov. 15, 2020. Trump campaign records show that Black Voices for Trump was an official part of the campaign, much like other groups that target specific voters, such as Latinos for Trump and Evangelicals for Trump. The group’s archived website said the site was ""Paid for by Donald J. Trump for President, Inc."" Floyd told Reuters that he had an office in the same building as the core campaign in Virginia, where he said he worked on the same floor as the most senior staffers of Trump’s political operation. Trump called out Floyd for applause while speaking before a crowd at a rally for the group at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta in November 2019. “We’re delighted to be joined by Harrison Floyd of our Black Voices coalition,” the president said. “Where’s Harrison? Where’s Harrison?” Since April of this year, Floyd has worked as a managing partner at Commonwealth Holdings International, a Washington-based investment firm that specializes in helping clients invest in cryptocurrencies, according to the firm’s webpage and Floyd’s LinkedIn page. Floyd served in the U.S. Marine Corps for nearly 11 years ending in 2014, including stints as a machine gunner, a martial arts trainer, and an information operations planner, his LinkedIn page shows. As a spokesperson for the Republican National Committee (RNC), the party’s national organizing body, Douglas regularly posts blog items on the RNC website. He has used that platform to applaud a Republican-backed election law in Georgia that the Justice Department says is “discriminatory” against Black voters. Douglas countered in an RNC blog post that the law, passed this year, “makes it easier to vote and harder to cheat.” During the 2020 campaign, Douglas was active in Georgia for Black Voices for Trump, according to a Reuters review of his social media posts between August and November of last year. At an event on Aug. 1, 2020, promoted by the Fayette County Republican Party, Douglas introduced himself as the “regional engagement coordinator for Trump victory” and said he was helping to lead Black Voices for Trump in Georgia. Kutti, a Chicago publicist, has said her clients have included rap star Kanye West; a West spokesperson says Kutti wasn’t associated with the rapper at the time of the Freeman meeting. Kutti was a supporter of Black Voices for Trump, her social media history shows. On Dec. 5, 2020, more than a month after Election Day, she posted a photo on Instagram showing her holding a “Black Voices for Trump” sign at a Trump rally in Valdosta, Georgia. At that rally, Trump played snippets of the State Farm Arena surveillance video of Freeman and her daughter on a giant screen. The footage, he said, revealed a “crime” committed by “Democrat workers.” TIME RUNNING OUT BEFORE JAN. 6 The mission for which Floyd recruited Kutti and Douglas came on Jan. 4 - at the height of Trump’s efforts to overturn the November election, and two days before the U.S. Capitol riots on Jan. 6, the day that Congress met to certify Democrat Joe Biden’s election victory. In an interview with Reuters, Floyd described a fevered atmosphere of allegations involving Freeman in December. At the time, Trump and his lawyers were continuing to press false claims that the election had been stolen. Floyd said he received calls from “across the country” from people saying they could arrange immunity for Freeman if she were to confess to election fraud. “Some of those phone calls that I mentioned were from lawyers and attorneys who were saying, ‘Is this true? Does she really want immunity?’” He declined to identify those attorneys. Asked how he knew Freeman wanted immunity, Floyd cited “a lot of chatter and discussion on the internet … People were saying, ‘We're hearing that this is what she wanted,’” he said. “But no one could confirm anything.” When Floyd spoke with Freeman by speakerphone at the precinct late on Jan. 4, he told Reuters, he believed time was running out to arrange a deal because the election would soon be certified on Jan. 6. “If Ms. Freeman wanted to get a message to the president and wanted immunity,” Floyd said, “that’s really important to get to the right people before an election is certified.” Floyd said he reached out to Kutti and Douglas to approach Freeman. “I had spoken to some people that I knew and made arrangements for and secured a place where Ms. Freeman could go,” he said, “a place where no one would know that she was there, and no one would harass her there.” ‘WERE THOSE HONEST BALLOTS?’ Kutti showed up uninvited at Freeman’s door at about 8:30 p.m. on Jan. 4, police records show. As Reuters reported earlier this month, Freeman told police that during that night’s encounter, Kutti tried to get her to falsely implicate herself in voting fraud. A Cobb County Police report identified Kutti as an “alleged Trump supporter who attempted to get Ms. Freeman to make false claims about the ballot counting.” Freeman, who’d been subjected to threats, was wary of strangers but wanted to hear out Kutti, so she asked the police to send an officer to watch over them. According to the police report, Kutti told the responding officer that she had been sent by a “high-profile individual” and that Freeman was in unspecified danger, “due to the election.” Kutti told the officer that Freeman had just 48 hours to “get ahead of the issue” before unknown people were going to show up at her home. The officer suggested that the two women meet at the police station, which they did. At the precinct, Douglas sat with Kutti and Freeman as the two women talked in the corner of a room, police bodycam footage shows. After a few minutes, Kutti put Floyd on the speakerphone. Freeman initially told Reuters she thought Floyd’s name was “Harrison Ford.” The news organization later determined that Kutti had introduced the man on the speakerphone as Harrison “Floyd.” That conclusion was backed by an analysis by an outside forensic expert, Focal Forensics, of that portion of their conversation, which was captured on a police officer’s body camera. After Reuters presented this finding to Floyd, he confirmed it was him. As the meeting began, the footage shows, Kutti told Freeman: “You are a loose end for a party that needs to tidy up.” Floyd came on via speakerphone, and the meeting continued for another hour. Large portions of the bodycam audio are not clearly audible, because the officer stepped further away from the conversation at Kutti’s request. Some details can be heard, however. Floyd asked Freeman about what was in the ballot boxes she handled on election night. He asked her if she needed “to know what was already on those ballots inside those ballot boxes?” Freeman responded: “No, we don’t look at them. I couldn’t tell you who had the most, who had the least.” “So let me ask you this,” Floyd said. “Were those honest ballots?” Freeman responded: “Yeah,” and then went into a detailed explanation of the process for handling and counting the ballots. She said the ballots are in sealed envelopes, so it’s impossible to know which candidate was picked by the voter. “Democrat or Republican,” she said, “you don’t know that.” ‘MY NAME NEEDS TO BE CLEARED’ In his interview Monday, Floyd said the meeting was arranged in part to help Freeman cut an immunity deal. Freeman is heard on the recording saying she needs a lawyer, but for a different reason: to prove her innocence. In the meeting, Freeman mentioned that Fulton County officials had publicly cleared her of any ballot fraud. But she expressed worry about another false accusation that she had done something untoward with USB drives used in the vote-counting. Trump’s lawyer, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, had publicly accused Freeman and her daughter of manipulating vote totals while passing USB drives between them, “as if they’re vials of heroin and cocaine” - again, falsely asserting the State Farm Arena video showed a crime. Freeman told Kutti and Floyd that the USB allegations had been circulated on YouTube, the bodycam footage shows. “That’s why I want an attorney,” Freeman said, “because I know my name needs to be cleared.” After striking out with Freeman that night, Floyd said, there was one more communication with her, which he declined to detail, and then the pursuit was dropped. In hindsight, Floyd said, “that initial approach in the police station could have and should have been done better.” (Reporting by Linda So and Jason Szep; additional reporting by Joseph Tanfani and Nathan Layne; editing by Brian Thevenot)",Politics/Reuters,Special Report: Trump campaign official set up meeting where Georgia election worker was pressured,https://news.yahoo.com/special-report-trump-campaign-official-160816866.html
12/22/2021,"DC police officer Michael Fanone was beaten unconscious by rioters at the Capitol on January 6. He resigned Monday and will leave the department on December 31, The Washington Post reported. Fanone, who made extensive media appearances, is due to join CNN as an on-air contributor in 2022. The DC Metropolitan Police police officer beaten by Capitol rioters resigned on Monday, The Washington Post reported. He is due to take up a new job at CNN as an on-air contributor. Michael Fanone was knocked unconscious and badly injured in the attack at the Capitol and later appeared on cable news shows to warn of what he called the threat to democracy posed by people like the rioters. Fanone, who says he now suffers with PTSD, recounted the attack in detail during his testimony in July before Congress' January 6 commission. He said he was ""grabbed, beaten, tased, all while being called a traitor to my country."" He said his badge and equipment were stolen and he heard his attackers shout: ""Kill him with his own gun."" A still from Fanone's bodycam, included by the Justice Department in court filings, showed Fanone being mobbed by men. The circled man, Thomas Sibick, is accused of attacking Fanone and stealing his badge. In one memorable appearance not long after January 6, Fanone discussed the rioters who helped protect him when others wanted to harm him, giving them the message: ""Thank you, but fuck you for being there."" On Monday, Fanone told The Post he resigned and would become a contributor for CNN on law-enforcement issues in the new year. Brain Stelter, CNN's chief media correspondent, tweeted Monday that the network had confirmed the appointment. Fanone's appearances in Congress and on cable news drew scorn from his colleagues, he told The Post. ""Clearly there are some members of our department who feel their oath is to Donald Trump and not to the Constitution,"" Fanone said. ""I no longer felt like I could trust my fellow officers and decided it was time to make a change."" Fanone, who has been a police officer for two decades, returned to limited duty for the first time in September after several months of absence, The Post said. His last day as a police officer is due to be December 31. Fanone said that on his return he was assigned to a division that analyzes statistics, ignoring his preference to work at a training academy. He told the Post that he felt his commanders were trying to hide him from colleagues who disapproved of his media profile. Fanone told the newspaper there are now only two current DC police officers he counts as friends.

12/22/2021,"Dec. 21—Pictures of Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham with other politicians or everyday people are a regular sight on social media. But here's the tall and the short of it: Some photos of the governor generate a bigger response than others. Such was the case over the weekend when the 4-foot-10 governor posed next to a New Mexico State Police officer who is a towering 7 feet tall. The picture of Lujan Grisham standing next to Officer Timothy Smith, who has been on the force two years, sparked thousands of reactions on the governor's official Facebook and Twitter accounts. ""People appreciate the governor posting something that just puts a smile on folks' face, and she really enjoyed meeting Officer Smith,"" Nora Meyers Sackett, the governor's press secretary, said Monday. ""It was just a nice moment,"" she said. Lujan Grisham met the officer, who is assigned to District 2 in Eagle's Nest, when she traveled to Springer to meet with the community and attend the town's annual Christmas light parade at the invitation of Mayor Boe Lopez, Sackett said. ""She likes to say she's the shortest governor, and she is,"" she said. ""She asked him if she could take a photo with him, and he was very, very kind and said yes, that he was happy to do so."" Sackett called their meeting ""a remarkable combination of different heights."" The height difference is so striking the picture almost appears Photoshopped. ""There wasn't any illusion about it — it was just an accurate picture of them,"" she said. ""There's some great diversity in New Mexico and that includes height diversity. The governor is a perfect example of that."" As of Monday afternoon, the picture had generated more than 5,200 reactions on Facebook, most of them ""likes,"" along with more than 500 comments. On Twitter, the picture so far has received nearly 1,100 likes, 76 retweets and more than 100 comments. The comments on both social media platforms were mixed. Some aren't fit for a family newspaper. ""Kind of reminds me of Napoleon and his army, his enforcers,"" Chris Nixon wrote on Facebook. George Fischer thanked the governor for all she does for New Mexico and the officer for his service to the community. ""I guess you don't compare NM to other states,"" Robbi Jennings responded to Fischer's comment. ""She is a failure."" Brittny Huffman steered clear of politics in the thread. ""This is how I feel when walking with my son,"" she wrote, adding she's 5-foot-5 and her son is a foot taller. ""He gives me a hard time about being short,"" Huffman added.

12/22/2021,"The labor shortage hit Kentucky hard. A recent report indicated that the state had one of the highest quit rates nationwide in August, along with one of the highest job-opening rates. Months later, the state was still near the top of the list for most unfilled job openings. Insider spoke with more than a dozen Kentuckians to uncover what's powering the shortage and how it could be solved, and spoke to representatives from both the Democratic and Republican sides of the aisle in the heavily conservative state. Rep. John Yarmuth, a Democrat who chairs the House Budget Committee, argues there's a role for the federal government to ease the shortage. We also interviewed Yarmuth's Republican colleague James Comer, whose district covers the western part of the state. Yarmuth, whose district includes Louisville, said he's heard many complaints from local businesses about the labor shortage but not from constituents themselves, and that employers ""are complaining, but they don't really have any ideas for what the government could do to make their jobs any more appealing."" As for his Republican colleagues, he said he hasn't talked to any of them about solving the labor shortage. The Louisville area is thriving by paying workers more, though. ""There are lots of opportunities in my district."" Yarmuth is retiring from Congress next year. Here's a transcript of Insider's interview with the representative, lightly edited for brevity. During the pandemic, the quit rate in Kentucky was especially high — the highest in the country for a while — and the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce foundation said the state was in a ""workforce crisis."" What do you think of that? I think to an extent we're in the same boat that many other places are in. We had healthcare fears, we had concerns about the disease itself. We have and still have problems with childcare. And with school shutdowns, that was a big factor, with parents having to stay home and take care of kids. This past year, in August, when we apparently led the country in percentage of job quits, we also had a very significant increase, and new people taking new jobs — actually more people taking new jobs than had quit. So that was a little bit of a mixed picture. What that represented was essentially people understanding that they could do better, they found better jobs, quite simply. I mean, we still have a $7.25 minimum wage in Kentucky, and people realize that they could make $15 an hour, and they so they quit a job and took the better one. So in that respect, they were better off. Those businesses that either refused to or have been unable to compete with Amazon distribution centers paying $15 to $18 an hour. So a lot of people left low-paying jobs. We've lost tons of restaurants in my district and jobs in the hospitality field. People are desperately in need of those positions. So we got a big shortage, but it's not necessarily all bad news. Because a lot of people are doing much better now than they did before. What do you think needs to happen for the labor shortage to end? I'm very supportive of increasing the federal minimum wage, but it seems like, again, the market is actually taking care of a lot of that. I don't know that anybody right now can hire anybody under $11 or $12. I just don't think that job exists right now. So the combination of the pandemic and the need for more people has changed the equation. It's now very much a pro-worker environment, in terms of wages. So I don't think that a federal minimum wage at this point would make all that much difference in terms of the labor shortage, because there are plenty of jobs available at $15 an hour — jobs that don't require high-level skills. We've got so many distribution and logistics jobs available in the area that if you want a $15-an-hour job, you can get one, basically, regardless of your skill level. [My district is] just Louisville, but the surrounding counties obviously benefit from this. We got UPS as our largest employer, they have about 20,000 employees and they're hiring more people all the time. And they're paying in that $15- to $16-an-hour range and with benefits and with education benefits, and it's a pretty attractive place to work. And then all the companies like Amazon and Zappos and others who have distribution centers around us are all in the same boat. E-commerce is has expanded so dramatically during the pandemic. I don't think that's true of everywhere in Kentucky, certainly not true in Appalachia, there are not a lot of alternative jobs available. I think over half of our state is a childcare desert. Can you talk a little bit more about that specific part of it? Obviously, that's an element of childcare when you've got kids, 3- and 4-year-olds, go into school. [Addressing] that would be a significant help in resolving labor shortage. It's not going to be immediate, but as a longer-term solution to labor shortages, I think that's a big factor. Because clearly, the way the workforce is changing with more options available to work at home, and then you kind of make that judgment as to, ""Well, am I going to take a job where I have to go to an office, and then I have to pay for childcare, or I can work at home and not have to pay for childcare?"" That becomes a balancing act, and may contribute in some ways to the labor shortage. And because those people who might stay at home might otherwise take other jobs. So I just think there's so many changes going on in the workforce that I think it's probably too early to figure out what the horizon is going to be three, four years from now — the landscape is going to be three or four years from now, because so many things are changing right now in terms of the nature of work, the nature of the jobs that are available. And what we've seen is that the government's support, most of the studies show, it didn't make that much difference in people deciding to go back to work or not particularly when [unemployment benefits] went from $600 to $300. The share of Kentucky residents working has actually been going down for almost 20 years. Why do you think it has gone this long without being addressed? And then do you believe that there are more factors at play here? We've got an aging population, so I think you've got a lot of people who just aged out of the workforce or decided to retire when they could. We have a ton of people in the state with bad health and disabilities. We have a very bad health profile. I suspect that has something to do with it as well. Yeah, there are a lot of factors. I think it's pretty complicated. (Editor's note: Kentucky is ranked as one of America's least-healthy states. A report from the United Health foundation placed Kentucky near the bottom for health behaviors and health outcomes.) I would imagine that a lot of younger people are trying to seek other opportunities elsewhere. Is that a factor? I suspect that in some parts of the state it is. I don't think that's a factor in my district. But my district is very unlike the rest of [the state]. It's a vibrant, significant urban area. And there are lots of opportunities in my district. But I think in some places in the state, certainly, when you're talking about coal country, those jobs really aren't available anymore. They certainly aren't attractive. And I think a lot of those young people have left those areas to try and find better opportunities. What are you hearing from your own constituents about the labor shortage? I don't think we've heard much from constituents who are in the workforce. We've heard a lot from employers. We have two big Ford plants in my district, and you know, part of that's cultural — there are young people nowadays who are not necessarily attracted to jobs where they have to stand on an assembly line all day, they'd rather have more flexible schedules. And they can make as much money being a barista as they can being an assembly-line worker. That's what I've heard from the management at Ford. And we have what used to be the GE Appliance division, owned by a Chinese company, Haier. And they're saying the same thing, that it's hard to find people who want to take a job where they have to be on time every day and work a set schedule and that type of thing. Do employers come to you with ideas for how to solve the labor shortage? No, not really. I haven't heard any exciting ideas. Until a couple years ago, people were starting at Ford and had like, $13 an hour. And even though they probably could raise that rate pretty quickly, that wasn't a particularly appealing job to many of them. And those employers kind of recognize that they have to make those jobs more attractive. For a while, we were hearing end-to-end that it's the unemployment supplement that's killing us, but that's quieted down and now it's more realization. People are complaining, but they don't really have any ideas for what the government could do to make their jobs any more appealing. Have you had any communication with your Republican colleagues in the House or Senate about the labor shortage?  I haven't had any conversations about that with any of them. The climate crisis is going to change how Americans work, and, ultimately, what jobs are available. So how do you see that playing out in your state where coal is still a significant part of the economy? To be honest, coal is a very minor part of our economy, it's almost a nonfactor right now. I mean, I have more people employed in one plant in my district than are employed in the entire coal industry in the entire state. Only about 5,000 people are working in the coal industry, just inconsequential. It's less than 1% of the economy. So the people in coal country are very much aware that coal is not a future opportunity for them, and they're going to have to find something else. So most of the emphasis has been to try and find ways to bring new industries to coal country, particularly Eastern Kentucky. But it's more of a cultural thing than an economic thing right now. And they all know coal is dead. But they love their region and they want to stay there and they're looking for help to bring industries there that can replace those jobs. And if I may ask as well, like the child tax credit, as it stands right now, it's only one year and the House bill. Lawmakers are going to have to deal with that again, so how do you see the child tax credit playing out? Do you think that will help ease the pressure on families? The reaction of my constituents from the extent from the refundable tax, child tax credit, and the increase in it was phenomenal. I mean, I had more people tell me that it changed their lives more than anything we've ever done. It lifted tens of thousands of Kentuckians out of poverty, but obviously, if Republicans take over the the House or Senate, that's going to be very difficult to do. But I wouldn't say that it's a major factor in dealing with the labor shortage. It's a major factor in dealing with people's lives.

12/22/2021,"By Valerie Volcovici WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The main union representing U.S. coal miners urged West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin to reconsider his opposition to the Biden administration's $1.75 trillion climate and social spending bill to preserve measures that would have benefited its members. United Mine Workers of America International President Cecil Roberts, a long-time ally of Manchin's, said the sweeping bill contained important measures like an extension of funding to aid victims of black lung disease, tax incentives to urge manufacturers to build new factories and employ ex-miners, and protect union workers. “For those and other reasons, we are disappointed that the bill will not pass. We urge Senator Manchin to revisit his opposition to this legislation and work with his colleagues to pass something that will help keep coal miners working, and have a meaningful impact on our members, their families and their communities,"" Roberts said on Monday. Biden and party leaders negotiated with Manchin for months to satisfy his concerns over key elements of the Build Back Better legislation, but the West Virginia senator surprised his fellow Democrats on Sunday saying that he could not support the proposal. The Build Back Better plan aims to expand the social safety net and invest nearly $600 billion to tackle climate change through a variety of subsidies including for renewable power and electric vehicles. Many Democrats have said the bill is essential to the party's chances in the Nov. 8, 2022, mid-term elections and efforts to combat climate change. Manchin won re-election in 2018 as a Democrat in a deeply conservative state that twice voted for Donald Trump. The senator has objected to elements of the bill intended to fight climate change, which are opposed by the coal and natural gas industries that are economic drivers in his home state. Manchin founded the private coal brokerage Enersystems in 1988 and still owns a big stake in the company, which his son currently runs.

 Actress Bette Midler, a frequent and fierce critic of Republicans on her Twitter account, called out Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) on Monday, while also criticizing his home state of West Virginia. Midler said Manchin ""sold us out,"" apparently in reference to his blocking Democrats' social and climate spending package, and added he wanted the rest of the country to be like West Virginia: ""Poor, illiterate and strung out."" The Hocus Pocus actress' said the ""rest of America,"" just ""wants to move forward, not backward, like his state."" The 76-year-old actress' remarks drew criticism on Twitter and Midler later tweeted an apology for generalizing about the people of West Virginia, though she continued to call out Manchin, asking ""Is he really the best [West Virginia] has to offer its own citizens?""

12/22/2021,"A well-preserved dinosaur embryo has been found inside a fossilized egg. The fossilized dinosaur embryo came from Ganzhou, Jiangxi Province in southern China and was acquired by researchers in 2000. Researchers at Yingliang Group, a company that mines stones, suspected it contained egg fossils, but put it in storage for 10 years, according to a news release. When construction began on Yingliang Stone Natural History Museum, boxes of unearthed fossils were sorted through. ""Museum staff identified them as dinosaur eggs and saw some bones on the broken cross section of one of the eggs,"" Lida Xing of China University of Geosciences, Beijing, said in a news release. A embryo was found hidden within, which they named ""Baby Yingliang."" The embryo is that of the bird-like oviraptorosaurs, part of the theropod group. Theropod means ""beast foot,"" but theropod feet usually resembled those of birds. Birds are descended from one lineage of small theropods. In studying the embryo, researchers found the dinosaur took on a distinctive tucking posture before hatching, which had been considered unique to birds. The study is published in the iScience journal. Researchers say this behavior may have evolved through non-avian theropods. ""Most known non-avian dinosaur embryos are incomplete with skeletons disarticulated,"" said Waisum Maof the University of Birmingham, U.K. ""We were surprised to see this embryo beautifully preserved inside a dinosaur egg, lying in a bird-like posture. This posture had not been recognized in non-avian dinosaurs before."" While fossilized dinosaur eggs have been found during the last 100 years, discovering a well-preserved embryo is very rare, the researchers said in the release. The embryo's posture was not previously seen in non-avian dinosaur, which is ""especially notable because it's reminiscent of a late-stage modern bird embryo."" The researchers will continue to study the rare specimen in even more depth. They will attempt to image its internal anatomy. Some of its body parts are still covered in rocks. Their findings can also be used in more studies of fossil embryos.
