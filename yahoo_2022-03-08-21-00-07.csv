3/8/2022,"The Ukrainian defence ministry has a released audio from a call which it claims captured two Russian officers lamenting the death of a top general and the collapse of its secure communications network in Ukraine. In the call—which has been verified by Bellingcat, the fact-checking group known for exposing Kremlin misinformation—two purported Russian FSB officers are heard discussing the death of a general killed in fighting near Kharkiv, which has been hammered by shelling this month. Ukraine’s defence ministry named the general as Vitaly Gerasimov, chief of staff of the 41st Army, and Bellingcat reported that it had confirmed the death with Russian sources. In its statement, Ukraine’s defense intelligence agency said Gerasimov had been “liquidated” alongside “a number of senior Russian army officers” in fighting near Kharkiv. If Gerasimov’s death is confirmed, he would be the second Russian general to be killed in Ukraine within a week following the death of the 41st Army’s deputy commander, Andrei Sukhovetsky. A pro-Putin Chechnyan general, Magomed Tushayev, was also reported to have been killed. Russia’s failure to protect its top-ranking officers backs up reports from Ukraine that the Kremlin’s invasion force is in disarray. On the call released by the Ukrainian defense ministry, one FSB officer can be heard complaining that its encrypted comms system had been destroyed, allowing Ukrainian forces to listen in on Russian military orders. Bellingcat’s executive director, Christo Grozev, wrote: “In the phone call in which the FSB officer assigned to the 41st Army reports the death to his boss in Tula, he says they’ve lost all secure communications. Thus the phone call using a local sim card. Thus the intercept.” This is not the worst part. In the phone call in which the FSB officer assigned to the 41st Army reports the death to his boss in Tula, he says they've lost all secure communications. Thus the phone call using a local sim card. Thus the intercept. pic.twitter.com/cgHHo7VaRi — Christo Grozev (@christogrozev) March 7, 2022 Grozev went on: “His boss, who makes a looong pause when he hears the news of Gerassimov’s death (before swearing), is Dmitry Shevchenko, a senior FSB officer from Tula. We identified him by searching for his phone (published by Ukrainian military Intel) in open source lookup apps... In the call, you hear the Ukraine-based FSB officer ask his boss if he can talk via the secure Era system. The boss says Era is not working.” Grozen reported that Russia’s cryptophones may no longer work in Kharkiv because Russian forces had destroyed surrounding cell phone towers, and Russia’s encrypted comms system operates using 3G or 4G. The statement released by Ukraine’s military intelligence agency alluded to severe communications problems among Russian forces, saying: “The data obtained also indicate significant problems with communication in the occupier’s army and with the evacuation of their broken units.” Russia has not commented on reports of Gerasimov’s death.

3/8/2022,"Mikhail Khodorkovsky was once Russia's richest man, before spending almost a decade in prison. He told CNN that the Ukraine war has ""significantly reduced"" Putin's ability to stay in power. ""We are no longer thinking in terms of him being around another decade,"" he said in the interview. Mikhail Khodorkovsky — an exiled oligarch who was once the richest man in Russia — said on Friday that Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has ""significantly reduced"" the longtime president's chances of remaining in power. ""I'm convinced that Putin hasn't got much time left. Maybe a year, maybe three,"" he told CNN during an interview, adding later, ""Today we are no longer thinking in terms of him being around another decade as we thought a week ago."" Khodorkovsky is the former CEO of the Russian oil giant Yukos, a position that temporarily made him Russia's richest man in 2003 with a reported net worth of $15 billion. In 2001, he founded Open Russia, a diplomacy initiative that was later shut down by Russian authorities. After being charged with fraud and tax evasion, Khodorkovsky was sentenced to nine years in prison in 2005. He was later pardoned by Putin and released a year early in 2013. Khodorkovsky said his imprisonment was politically motivated. Putin's former prime minister testified that the Kremlin ordered Khodorkovsky's arrest due to his funding of the opposition party, according to a 2010 Reuters report. Now the exiled businessman lives in London and is known as one of Putin's most outspoken critics. In his interview with CNN, Khodorkovsky said Putin is his ""personal enemy"" but also ""the enemy of humankind."" A handful of Russian billionaires have spoken out over the past week to similarly denounce the invasion of Ukraine. His prediction that Russia's attack on Ukraine will eventually end Putin's rule has been echoed by experts at the Kennan Institute, a Russian research center in the US. ""The attack on Ukraine was not just an absolute crime,"" Mikhail Minakov, the institute's senior advisor on Ukraine, wrote in a blog post last week. ""It was an irreparable mistake that put into motion the end-game for Putin's regime in Russia.""

3/8/2022,"Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) posed a question on social media as war in Ukraine caused gas to spike to record highs. “Remember how cheap gas was during the Trump Administration?” His query was greeted with a few reminders he likely wasn’t looking for. Critics noted that gas prices plunged under former President Donald Trump due to the coronavirus pandemic shutting down much of the nation. Others reminded Jordan of his shifting story about whether or not he spoke to Trump on the day of the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol. Some on Twitter even reminded him about his time as assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University, where he was accused of ignoring molestation claims about the team’s doctor. Although Jordan has denied those charges, several athletes have corroborated the story. And those were just a few of the topics Jordan’s critics asked him to remember: This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.",Politics/HuffPost,Rep.

3/8/2022,"Tim Shanley, 32, from Sydney... and I am a product manager in the Superannuation industry
 I got married in late 2019 and was in relatively good shape. After coming back from my honeymoon my wife and I bought our first home together and I was on cloud nine. Then Covid hit in early 2020, and I started to work from home full-time. While I was still on a mental high, I was enjoying myself a little bit too much, and as a result my exercise and fitness regime took a back seat with gyms being closed, and so did my diet. I lost all structure and routine in my life and ended up over-eating, drinking too much alcohol, and pretty much stopped exercising. At my heaviest I tipped the scales at 113 kgs (249 pounds). I had lost all of my confidence, I was not feeling good about myself both mentally and physically, and I was starting to get concerned about my overall health and wellbeing from things such as elevated blood pressure, increased stress, trouble sleeping, and irritability. I was not happy, and was seeking joy artificially from comforts such as alcohol and food. Seeing myself in a photo from a wedding in late 2020 was my lightbulb moment. I didn’t like what I saw: I couldn’t accept the fact I had let myself go so much, and felt embarrassed. I realised I needed to make a change and make a change fast, so I reached out to the professionals to help me pull my finger out! I contacted Ultimate Performance in Sydney in late 2020 with the intention of starting 2021 fresh with a new mindset and with some big goals to get my life back on track. Not your usual ""diet and exercise"" story and we LOVE it! My program consisted of four workouts a week, two with my trainer and two by myself, which were a combination of full body high intensity, resistance training and heavy weight workouts. I also walked between a minimum of 15,000 to 20,000 steps a day every day. My program was 20 weeks long in total, and my target was to get down to 10 percent bodyfat. When I started the program, my thought process and attitude towards my diet completely changed and allowed me to take more accountability for what I was putting into my body and kept me honest. I started to watch what I was eating more closely though understanding macros, meal timing and nutrition. My trainer Saskia believed in me from day one. She gave me the motivation and encouragement needed to achieve my goals and equipped me with the tools to push myself to places I didn’t think I could go. She was very unselfish with her knowledge on health and fitness and was constantly feeding me information about how to train correctly, how to diet and understand nutrition, how to listen to my body and how to be confident and positive! I lost a total of 33 kgs (73 pounds) in 20 weeks and hit 10 percent body fat by the end of the journey which was one of my main goals. It was a long grind, but all worth it in the end and I couldn’t have been happier. The physical results speak for themselves, however it’s the things you can't see that I was more satisfied with, such as regaining my confidence, lowering blood pressure, improving my quality of sleep, and just having overall better and more consistent moods. Now I go to bed happy and wake up happy! You don’t need to have a background in strength training or weights to be able to achieve your health and fitness goals. I think it all comes down to attitude, discipline and commitment – if you have these three things, plus a positive mindset, most of the battle is already won. While the physical elements are tough, they are short lived, whereas the mental battle of sticking to a diet and routine is constant, but if you are able to hit small goals, your overall long term goals will be easier to achieve.
