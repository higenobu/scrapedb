5/2/2022,"The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has said he is prepared to sit down and work “constructively” with state premiers on the need for more hospital funding, but has ruled out making any grand funding promises before the election. Speaking in Queensland alongside the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, Albanese said he was aware of the pressure facing the state hospital system, but he was taking a “measured” approach in the campaign. “What we will do is sit down with premiers constructively and work these issues through,” Albanese said. “We know the pressure that’s there on the hospital systems. It’s one of the reasons why we’ve put forward, for example, urgent care clinics. Urgent care clinics are aimed at taking pressure off emergency departments, because we know that emergency departments are under such pressure. “But the other thing that we’re doing is being upfront in our discussions with the premiers – we’re not promising things in advance and then we’ll say something different after the election campaign.” Albanese said he wanted to be “very responsible, very measured” in his policy proposals given the “trillion dollars in debt” racked up by the Coalition that he would inherit in government. Palaszczuk and all state and territory leaders have been pushing the federal government to permanently lift the commonwealth’s funding guarantee to a 50-50 funding split beyond June 2023 when the current arrangement ends. The cost to the commonwealth is estimated at about $5bn extra a year.The Australian Medical Association has also been pushing for the extra 5% funding boost, saying the logjam affecting the country’s hospitals was leading to unnecessary deaths and delays for surgery. Palaszczuk said it was “no secret” that all of the state premiers and health ministers of both Liberal and Labor governments wanted an increase in health funding. “We’ve had two years of a global pandemic. It’s put pressure on our hospitals. I know with Anthony, he will listen. He will listen and he will conduct a listening exercise and look at those gaps and we’ll be able to work with him, not someone who won’t even allow it to be on the agenda at national cabinet.” The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has said that when the current pandemic-level hospital funding agreement ended in September, the state faced an effective cut of $1.5bn. “I would again, urge the prime minister and the federal treasurer to reconsider that $1.5bn cut to health that occurs in September,” Andrews said. Andrews said pent-up demand for health services that would emerge as the country came out of the pandemic would add to the strain on the state’s hospital network, which is already dealing with ambulance delays and lengthy call-wait times for the triple-zero service. The hot-button issue was also central to the recent South Australian election, with new Labor premier Peter Malinauskas ending Steven Marshall’s government after just one term by promising to fix the state’s ramping crisis. In Western Australia, ambulance ramping – the term used to describe the time ambulances wait outside hospitals as a result of bed block – doubled in 2021 even without the demand of Covid admissions on the state hospital system. At the last election, Bill Shorten promised to lift the commonwealth’s share of hospital funding to 50%, but came under fire from the Coalition for its large suite of policy offerings with a scare campaign focused on the “Bill you can’t afford”. Albanese’s policy offering at this election is deliberately small-target, with Labor reluctant to walk in to another scare campaign about how it would pay for promises in health and education. For health, the party is promising $135m for 50 new urgent care clinics that are designed to operate as an after-hours GP service to reduce hospital presentations for things such as cuts and burns. However, the AMA has said the policy will do little to reduce the strain on the country’s hospitals, with these patients not the cause of the bed block in the system.",News/Australia news,Election 2022: Anthony Albanese vows to work with states on hospital funding boost,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/02/election-2022-anthony-albanese-vows-to-work-with-states-on-hospital-funding-boost
5/2/2022,"The first evacuees from the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol are due to arrive in the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia on Monday morning, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. On Sunday around 100 civilians were evacuated from plant, the last redoubt for Ukrainian forces in the city. Zelenskiy said he hoped that “all the necessary conditions” would be met to allow the evacuation to continue on Monday. US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has become the highest-ranking US official to visit Ukraine since the outbreak of war, where she met president Zelenskiy. In a press conference afterwards, Pelosi said that the US would not be bullied. “If they are making threats, you cannot back down,” she said. Pelosi was presented with the order of Princess of Olga medal by Zelenskiy. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has denied that Russia is demanding the “surrender” of Zelenskiy as a condition for peace, or that Russia would attempt to claim victory in Ukraine by 9 May. “The pace of the operation in Ukraine depends, first of all, on the need to minimise any risks for the civilian population and Russian military personnel,” he told Italian broadcaster Mediaset. Russia’s latest strikes, including on grain warehouses and residential neighbourhoods, “prove once again that the war against Ukraine is a war of extermination for the Russian army,” Zelenskiy has said in his nightly address on Sunday, asking, “What could be Russia’s strategic success in this war?” The “ruined lives of people and the burned or stolen property will give nothing to Russia.” German chancellor Olaf Scholz has pledged to continue supporting Ukraine with money, aid and weapons, saying a pacifist approach to the war is “outdated.” His remarks to a May Day rally in Dusseldorf were an implicit rebuke to a group of intellectuals, lawyers and creatives who condemned Russia’s war of aggression in an open letter, but urged Scholz not to send heavy weapons to Ukraine. Opposition leader Friedrich Merz is reportedly set to travel to Kyiv on Monday. Pope Francis described the war in Ukraine as a “macabre regression of humanity” that makes him “suffer and cry”, in a Sunday noon address in St Peter’s Square. “My thoughts go immediately to the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, the city of Mary, barbarously bombarded and destroyed,” he said of the mostly Russian-controlled south-eastern port city, which is named after the Virgin Mary. The governor of the north eastern city of Kharkiv urged people not to leave shelters on Sunday due to intense shelling. Posting on Telegram, Oleh Synyehubov said: “In connection with the intense shelling, we urge residents of the northern and eastern districts of Kharkiv, in particular Saltivka, not to leave the shelter during the day without urgency.” Russia’s defence ministry has confirmed an attack on an airfield near Odesa on Saturday. It said its forces had destroyed a runway and hangar at an airfield, which contained weapons supplied by the US and EU. A fire broke out on Sunday at a Russian defence ministry site in Belgorod, close to the border with Ukraine, the region’s governor said, injuring one person. “On the the borders of three municipalities - Borisov, Belgorod and the urban district of Yakovlevsky - a fire broke out at one of the defence ministry’s facilities,” the governor of Russia’s Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said on Telegram. The European Union could phase out Russian oil imports by the end of the year, under the latest set of sanctions against Vladimir Putin’s war machine being discussed in Brussels. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has said for weeks that the EU is working on sanctions targeting Russian oil, but the key question is how and when the commodity is phased out. Russia’s online trolling operation is becoming increasingly decentralised and is gaining “incredible traction” on TikTok with disinformation aimed at sowing doubt over events in Ukraine, a US social media researcher has warned. Darren Linvill, professor at Clemson University, South Carolina, who has been studying the Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency (IRA) troll farm operation since 2017, said it was succeeding in creating more authentic-seeming posts.
