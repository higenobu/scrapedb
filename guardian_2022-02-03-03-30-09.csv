2/3/2022,"It is a scene of little drama, yet says so much that it stays in my mind. A couple of years ago, I was reporting in Ashington, Northumberland, as Labour activists debated what to offer voters in the approaching mayoral elections. The meeting room was inside the library, which was inside the council’s gym, which was inside a shiny great glass and steel hulk knocked up by Carillion, the giant that used to hoover up those PFI contracts – until it went bust. A town built on coal, Ashington had been home to the Pitmen Painters – the extraordinary band of miners who turned themselves into artists – but that economy and its traditions were long gone. The morning had been spent on a fairly fruitless round of door-knocking nearby, the voters glaring at the Labour members as if they were bothersome Jehovahs, while the wind whipped in from the North Sea. On one side of the library stood a huge Asda, on the other a big Lidl, offering their customers cheap food and their workers low wages. This was today’s vista: a bombed-out economy, an electorate estranged from politics, and a visibly shrinking public sector getting picked over for cash by a parasitic private sector. You couldn’t ask for a clearer picture of austerity Britain.At the end, I was collared by a woman. She’d been a teacher nearby and she wanted me to understand that, for her kids, places such as the Guardian, parliament and the Natural History Museum were impossibly far away. Long hours on the coach required cash their parents didn’t have and days their schools couldn’t afford. “They’ve never been to central London,” she said. “They live in a different country.”  Put those elements together and you have both catalyst for and cause of Boris Johnson’s levelling-up agenda. These are what Michael Gove calls the UK’s “overlooked and undervalued” communities. Punished by Margaret Thatcher, patronised by Tony Blair and cut adrift by the Westminster classes, they reacted in 2016 by voting in vast numbers for Brexit, then in 2019 turning swaths of the electoral map from red to blue. The MP for Ashington and the surrounding areas is ex-miner Ian Lavery, who in 2010 inherited a diehard Labour seat. At the last election, he won a majority of just 814. Which brings us to the crux of the Conservatives’ “levelling-up” problem. If Johnson is to win another election, he needs these voters to turn out again – especially given Tory vulnerability in previously true-blue seats such as Chesham and Amersham, which turned Lib Dem long before the public had ever heard the phrase “wine suitcase”. Yet ministers will not spend the billions, nor introduce the serious changes that could help places like Ashington. From infrastructure to education, all Johnson has to offer is old money and reheated policies. Everything else is in Rishi Sunak’s Treasury war chest, ready for his rainy-day tax cuts. Nor can the Tories prove any serious commitment to this agenda, least of all Gove, who has spent the past decade voting through cut after cut to local council funding. So what do they do instead? Two things. First, they divert some small change from London and the south-east towards the places the Tories won in 2019 – seats such as Darlington and Wolverhampton South West. Second, they follow Gove’s lead and unleash rhetorical bombast against the so-called elites in London. In short, they turn policy into posture and an economic problem into a culture war. Listen to Gove this week: the divide in this country, he says, is between “working people” and “metropolitan condescension”, singling out for attack residents of Notting Hill. Coming from a founder of the Tories’ Notting Hill set who is selling a £2m house in Kensington, that’s pretty rich. But he has chosen his target well: London is now a red metropolis. It is no country for old Tories. What makes Gove’s tale powerful is that it contains some truth. What makes it poisonous is that it purposely covers up the whole story. It talks about Notting Hill but ignores Grenfell. It bangs on about “the London media” but never asks why the media doesn’t then look more like ordinary Londoners – 40% of whom are black or brown or from an ethnic minority. (That might just liven up the comment pages of the Times.) On almost any measure, London does better than any other region in the UK, but much of this prosperity is enjoyed by a tiny minority. Factor in the sky-high cost of buying or renting in the capital, and as academic Jack Brown puts it in his recent book The London Problem, the truth is: “Londoners are working harder and longer for less and less reward, compared with the rest of the country.” Almost as many Londoners live in poverty as would make up the entire population of the north-east. You could clear the city of Manchester of every one of its residents and stuff it with children from London stuck below the poverty line and still need more room. Over the past 18 months, I have been visiting a primary school down the road from where I grew up in Edmonton, in the outskirts of north London. It is an area that played a huge part in the light-industrial revolution that swept the UK and the world, but now all those factories have gone and so has the economy – in a manner that the residents of Ashington would recognise. Teachers talk about how many of their kids leave because their parents have no proper housing. One girl aged about 10 spent a year riding with her mum on the top deck of night buses, because they had nowhere else to sleep. And they talk of how their pupils never visit the museums and attractions just half an hour away on the train. A teacher told me, “central London might as well be another planet”. The phrase sounded familiar. The data research firm CACI provided me with profiles of central Ashington and Edmonton Green. In many ways, they look alike. Household income is, if anything, higher in central Ashington, while private tenants in my old neighbourhood spend almost triple their counterparts in the north-east on rent. Overall, the Londoners, my Londoners, make do with half the disposable income of those in Ashington. The one big difference is that residents of Ashington are older and 98% white, whereas Edmonton has families from Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, Somalia and south Asia. Whether from the north or the south, economically these people are in the same boat – which makes it vital for the Tories to harp on about their cultural differences. Rich remainers, citizens of nowhere … you know the rest. These towns and suburbs haven’t somehow failed to keep up with the country; the country has failed them. Capital has sucked all it can from Edmonton and Ashington and Newport and Dundee – and it has cut and run, to get its fuel and workers cheaper elsewhere. It is the same problem all over, albeit with varied expressions. The job is not to level up, but to change course entirely.

2/3/2022,"A former French soldier who admitted kidnapping and killing an eight-year-old girl he abducted from a wedding reception has insisted her death was “a mistake” but still refuses to give details of how she died. At his long-awaited trial Nordahl Lelandais, 38, apologised to the family of Maelys De Araujo, who disappeared near Chambery in the French Alps in August 2017 sparking a six-month police search that dominated the national headlines for weeks.  During that time Lelandais, who was a military dog trainer in the army, denied having anything to do with the missing girl until forensic experts found a trace of blood in the boot of his car. He eventually confessed to killing Maelys but said it had been a “terrible mistake”. He has since been tried and sentenced to 20 years for beating to death another serviceman and is also on trial for the sexual assault of two girls aged five and six, shortly before Maelys was killed. Lelandais took the stand on the third day of the hearing, where he said that after being discharged from the army following an eye injury he had worked in a series of short-term jobs and became addicted to pornography. He was not on the original guest list at the wedding in 2017 but had spoken to the groom the day before and was given a last-minute invite. He showed up around midnight for dessert and to supply cocaine to two guests who had asked him to bring the drugs. Maelys got into his vehicle, an Audi A3, after he invited her to see his dogs. He then drove off. Video cameras spotted his car at 2.47am with what appeared to be a small passenger. Shortly afterwards Lelandais returned to the wedding, but left before the police arrived around 4.15am. Around 3am, when Maelys’s mother Jennifer alerted wedding guests to the fact that her daughter was missing, a huge search was launched. Lelandais apologised tearfully to the De Araujo family when the trial opened on Monday. They sat in the front row holding photographs and paintings of the girl. “I want to offer my apologies. I did indeed cause her death, but I didn’t want to. I will explain during the trial,” he said. Lelandais had told investigators that she had started crying in the car and he punched her several times in the face but did not mean to kill her. During questioning he also mentioned another man, Arthur Noyer, a soldier who had disappeared earlier in the year from a gay nightclub. Detectives examined the case and after Noyer’s skull was found, Lelandais admitted he had accidentally killed him after getting into a fight. The trial is expected to last three weeks with a verdict on 18 February.",News/World news,Maelys de Araujo: former French soldier tells court girl’s death was ‘a mistake’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/02/maelys-de-araujo-former-french-soldier-tells-court-girls-death-was-a-mistake
2/3/2022,"The idea of Roy Keane making a sensational return to the Stadium of Light is under consideration at League One Sunderland, with club officials expected to interview their former manager as they search for a replacement for Lee Johnson, who was sacked on Sunday. Keane, who is believed to be interested in the job, could face serious competition from strong candidates including the former Middlesbrough managers Neil Warnock and Jonathan Woodgate in addition to Grant McCann, recently dismissed by Hull. Sunderland’s owner, the trust fund billionaire Kyril Louis-Dreyfus, says there has been interest in the post from “all over the world”.  Keane making a comeback 13 years after walking out on Sunderland would be guaranteed to fill the Stadium of Light to its near-50,000 capacity. How the infamously prickly former Manchester United captain turned acerbic television pundit would find working alongside Kristjaan Speakman, Sunderland’s head of football, in the mud-on-boots environs of League One represents an intriguing question. Keane managed Sunderland from 2006-2008, leading them into the Premier League in 2007 and keeping them in the top flight before resigning after a disagreement with the then owner, Ellis Short. Although he assisted Martin O’Neill in coaching the Republic of Ireland, Keane has not been a club manager since his sacking by Ipswich in 2011 but is said to feel he has unfinished business at Sunderland and he retains a deep affection for the club. Woodgate impressed as caretaker manager at Championship Bournemouth last season and the former England defender has the added advantage of a friendship with Sunderland’s returning striker Jermain Defoe. At 39 Defoe re-signed for Sunderland on transfer deadline day after leaving Rangers and would enjoy working with Woodgate as the team endeavour to secure promotion. The 73-year-old Warnock’s candidature cannot be discounted given his record of multiple promotions with assorted clubs, and Sunderland are well aware that McCann led Hull out of League One last season. Louis-Dreyfus is likely to take his time over an appointment and has placed Mike Dodds in caretaker charge for Saturday’s League game at home to Doncaster with coaching assistance from Mike Procter, Phil Jevons and David Preece. The 25-year-old owner wants to restore a club capable of attracting 30,000-plus gates in League One to the Premier League but first must find a manager to end their four-year stay in the third tier. Having run out of patience with Johnson in the wake of last Saturday’s 6-0 defeat at Bolton it is a decision he needs to get right.",Sport/Football,Sunderland want to interview Roy Keane over possible return as manager,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/02/sunderland-want-to-interview-roy-keane-over-possible-return-as-manager
2/3/2022,"On Tuesday, Whoopi Goldberg was suspended from The View for stating, with striking confidence, that the Holocaust was “not about race”. She made the statement just days after National Holocaust Remembrance Day, when celebrities and politicians around the world had remembered the darkest period in world history, the racist genocide of 6 million Jews, roughly two-thirds of European Jewry, by Nazi Germany. Most emphasized the importance of remembering this horrific part of history to ensure “never again”. Goldberg’s comments were also made a week after a Tennessee school board banned the Pulitzer-winning Holocaust graphic novel Maus from schools.  While Goldberg’s ignorance of the Holocaust is painful, it is far from striking. Many Americans cannot even remember the Holocaust, because they don’t know what it is. For instance, a 2018 poll by the Pew Research Center found that just 62% of Americans know that the Holocaust refers to the extermination of Jews. Almost half (49%) know that 6 million Jews were killed. Although these numbers are up from 1993, where they were 54% and 35%, other polls confirm that knowledge remains limited at best. The 2020 Pew edition of “What Do Americans Know About the Holocaust?” finds that “most US adults know what the Holocaust was, and approximately when it happened, but fewer than half can correctly answer multiple-choice questions about the number of Jews who were murdered, or the way Adolf Hitler came to power”. There is little difference in terms of age, gender, partisanship or region, but “race” differences are quite big, with black people having on average 1.2 of the four questions correct, Hispanics 1.7, and white people 2.5. Obviously, this is strongly related to level of education, another important variable to explain differences – as is whether you know someone who is Jewish. Previous studies have reported equally disturbing findings, including a bigger gap between the (lack of) knowledge of older and younger Americans. For instance, a 2018 poll by Schoen Consulting found that 31% of Americans thought 2 million or fewer Jews died in the Holocaust, while the percentage was 41 among millennials. It also reported that 41% of Americans did not know that Auschwitz was a Nazi extermination camp, and just one third of millennials did know. This shocking lack of knowledge is not without consequences. You can’t learn lessons from the past without knowledge of the past. Even if people know roughly what the Holocaust means, if they don’t know roughly what happened and why it happened, “never again” might become wishful thinking. In fact, 58% of Americans think “something like the Holocaust could happen again”. With antisemitism on the rise, in terms of verbal and physical violence, knowledge becomes even more crucial. Pew found that people with more knowledge about the Holocaust have “warmer feelings” towards Jewish people. This will hopefully help inoculate them against the antisemitism they encounter in the public debate, from such diverse voices as Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, to some of the critique of Israel, to, most problematically, the far right, including the former president. Interestingly, Americans agree wholeheartedly. A staggering 93% of Americans believe that “all Americans should learn about the Holocaust while at school”, and 80% say it is important to keep teaching about the Holocaust so it doesn’t happen again. A rare bipartisan consensus, which should make the implementation easier. There is already a wealth of excellent Holocaust educational material available from organizations like the Anti-Defamation League, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, the United Nations, and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. While most of these materials are aimed at the teachers, a new graphic adaptation of Anne Frank’s diary might be a particularly good tool to reach children from Generation Z (as well as millennials). Anne Frank’s Diary: the Graphic Adaptation is a beautifully illustrated graphic novel that conveys the key messages of the seminal text. While there are some problems with the depth and scope of the story, as well as with the representation of the writer Anne Frank, it might do a better job than the original in reaching generations that are more visually-oriented. Whatever the book or movie chosen, it is crucial that the Holocaust is taught again at US schools. And not just the bare facts, but the process that led to this horrific event. While I disagree with the popular – and profitable – warnings of a new fascism, there is no doubt that antisemitism and the far right are challenging US democracy in an increasingly violent manner. If we don’t educate our young and our old, history might indeed repeat itself and “never again” will prove little more than wishful thinking.

2/3/2022,"Controversial plans for a new Wimbledon show court are to be put to a vote of councillors in a motion that could see them block the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) 10-storey tennis stadium on a protected park. Opposition councillors are “plotting a showdown vote” on Wednesday night on the controversial stadium plans next door to the famous tennis complex.  They claim the plans will “concrete over” the Capability Brown-designed parkland and “lead to the destruction of countless mature trees, all for the sake of courts that will only be used for a few weeks a year”. Liberal Democrat and Conservative councillors will call on the Labour-run Merton council to enforce restrictive covenants that prevent building on the Grade II* listed parkland. “Enforcing the covenants would ensure the All England Club’s proposals would be blocked even if its planning application is successful,” the Lib Dem councillors said in advance of the meeting at which they have tabled the motion. Despite the covenant, the club has submitted plans for a 95-metre long, 28-metre high, 8,000-seat “Parkland show court” on the land designed by Brown for the first Earl Spencer in 1768. The plans, which the club said would enhance its “tennis in an English garden” image, also include 38 ground courts, several ancillary buildings and 9.4km of roads and paths on the protected land. More than 1,200 people have submitted formal objections via the council’s websites. The AELTC bought the land from the council for £5.2m in 1993, but agreed to legal covenants “preventing the use of the land otherwise than for leisure or recreation purposes or as an open space”. The club rented the land to Wimbledon Park Golf Club on a lease due to expire in 2041. However, eager to expand the championships and accommodate preliminary matches on site, the tennis club offered the golf club members £65m to buy out the lease and expand its footprint. The golf club members, who included TV presenters Piers Morgan, Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, and former cabinet secretary Lord O’Donnell, voted in favour of the deal in 2018 and each collected a £85,000 windfall. In advance of the meeting, Paul Kohler, councillor and Lib Dem parliamentary candidate for Wimbledon, said: “The covenants enshrine in law the public assurances given by both the council and the All England Club to preserve the Wimbledon Park land as green, open space for Wimbledon residents. Those residents have a right to expect that those promises be kept.” Kohler said the AELTC’s plans would “concrete over a significant amount of green space and would lead to the destruction of countless mature trees, all for the sake of courts that will only be used for a few weeks a year”. Merton Conservatives said: “The Labour administration must not break its promise to protect this land from development by the AELTC. Yet residents tell local councillors they believe that Merton Labour cannot be trusted to deal with this matter transparently and in accordance with due process.” Conservative MP for Wimbledon Stephen Hammond said: “The AELTC’s application has caused widespread concern among the community in Wimbledon. The application raises four major issues of concern: the closure of Church Road for two weeks a year, the number of courts planned, the bulk and density of the show court, and the assured accessibility of the public park. “I have made it clear to the AELTC that I think the application is too large and the benefits of mitigating it to reduce the concerns set out above.” Many residents have contacted me to share their concerns on the AELTC's proposed development.

2/3/2022,"Smarties will be made in Bulgaria and Fruit Pastilles in the Czech Republic, under plans by Nestlé to close a factory near Newcastle. The GMB trade union said the site at Fawdon, which has been making chocolate since 1958, was profitable and that plans to shift confectionery production offshore from 2023 – with the loss of 475 jobs – were “unacceptable”.  “This will have a devastating impact on workers and their families,” said Ross Murdoch, GMB national officer. “Meanwhile, transporting finished products from sites in Europe back to the UK – where they are consumed – will result in significant additional road and sea miles increasing pollution and environmental damage. “GMB and Unite will now speak to members in Fawdon and find out what they want to do next. We will give them whatever support and resources they need to fight this.” Under Nestlé’s proposals, Fruit Pastilles, Randoms and Jelly Tots will be made in the Czech Republic, Toffee Crisp bars will be made in Poland, while Mini Eggs and Smarties will be made in Bulgaria. The GMB said it had presented alternative plans drawn up by an independent experts, but that they had been rejected by Nestlé. Boris Johnson was last year urged to intervene to save the Fawdon site, which began producing chocolate in 1958 for Rowntree. The British confectionery company was bought by Switzerland-based Nestlé in 1988. Nestlé has previously said that brands produced in Fawdon were smaller and “low-growth” and that it would invest £29m in factories in York and Halifax that manufacture bigger brands. “We do not underestimate the impact that the closure of Fawdon factory would have on the local area and, as part of the consultation, we want to work with the local community to find ways that we can support the area and our employees if these proposals were to go ahead,” the company said last year.

2/3/2022,"A Cambridge University college has denied that it is seeking to cancel the existence of one its most significant benefactors because of links to the slave trade while continuing to enjoy the benefits of his generosity. Jesus College has applied to church authorities to remove a memorial to Tobias Rustat from a prominent position on the west wall of its Grade I-listed college chapel. The move follows an inquiry by a legacy of slavery working party set up to review the college’s historical links to enslavement and its long term impact.  During the first day of a hearing in a consistory court – an ecclesiastical court dealing with matters of law relating to the church – Mark Hill QC, appearing for the college, insisted the application was “nothing to do with erasing, cancelling or in some way nullifying the existence and the name of Rustat”. The issue the court had to decide, Hill said, was whether the memorial should remain in its current location or should be removed to a new permanent site elsewhere in the college where it would be a “significant and accessible exhibit”. According to the college, Rustat (1608-1694), who was one of Jesus’s most significant benefactors, “had financial and other involvement in the Royal African Company (RAC), a slave trading company, over a substantial period including at the time when he donated to the college”. The dean of the chapel, the Rev James Crockford, told the hearing that the marble memorial – described in court as “an internationally recognised monument – acted as a barrier to worship and participation in chapel life and that some undergraduates were “disturbed and upset” by it. He told the hearing on Wednesday that students felt uncomfortable about the memorial as it appeared to “celebrate” the man and his financial dealings, and warned that if it remained in the chapel they would be less likely to participate in the life of the chapel. Justin Gau, appearing on behalf of those opposed to the removal of the memorial, however challenged the characterisation of Rustat in emails sent by undergraduates objecting to the memorial. He said it was “not true” that Rustat had amassed “much of his wealth from the RAC” as had been claimed. He also challenged another email from an undergraduate who said it had been clearly demonstrated that Rustat “was a very active slave trader”. Gau said there was “no demonstration in any document that Tobias Rustat was any sort of slave trader”. Gau also raised concerns about a number of emails from different undergraduates which all appeared to use the same wording to express their opposition. The emails read: “It’s totally wrong for the statue of someone who was so heavily involved in the horrific crimes of slavery to be glorified in the heart of our community.” He asked the dean where the repeated phrase had come from and whether the college had made any effort to “correct” it, and said undergraduates “have not had a true view of Rustat’s life”. He also claimed the legacy of slavery working party did have more precise information about Rustat’s financial involvement but did not circulate it. Giving evidence later in the day, Sonita Alleyne, Master of Jesus College and the first black master of any Oxbridge college, was asked by Gau if she thought life was a “bed of roses”, and that students should not be confronted with uncomfortable subjects in church. She responded: “I’m the last person that believes life is a bed of roses … but we don’t set out to make life more difficult for people”. Responding to Gau’s suggestion that Rustat’s history should be “contextualised” through an explanatory plaque in the chapel, she said: “There is not enough space on the wall … how big would a plaque have to be? How will we fit the stories of all the people who were enslaved and who died in the process?” She said the chapel was “our sanctified space, our pastoral space … I have great faith and I’m here today because I have great faith that we are in an age where equality is paramount”. Gau said Rustat had been a “generous benefactor” of the college, and that “despite his very small involvement in the slave trade” there was now a black female Master of the college. Alleyne said: “Which murder, which lynching … how much sin do you need to have before you come off the wall? Rustat’s gift to Jesus College, made in 1671, was part of a wider philanthropy that began in the mid-1660s. Although he did not attend Jesus himself, his father did, and he donated £2,000 – a huge sum at the time – to fund scholarships for the children of Anglican priests. The court hearing, which is taking place in Cambridge, in the shadow of the Rustat memorial in the college chapel, is expected to last until Friday.",News/Education,Cambridge college denies it seeks to erase benefactor over slave trade links,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/02/cambridge-college-denies-it-seeks-to-erase-benefactor-over-slave-trade-links
2/3/2022,"Councillors in Padua have agreed to install the first statue honouring a woman in the city’s historic centre, but it remains to be seen if the monument will be placed among the dozens of statues dedicated to men in the prominent Prato della Valle square. The decision followed a fiery debate that further exposed the scarcity of statues celebrating women not only in Padua but across Italy.  Margherita Colonnello and Simone Pillitteri, the two councillors who submitted the motion, had to backtrack on their original proposal to place a statue of Elena Lucrezia Cornaro Piscopia – the first woman in the world to earn a PhD – on one of the two empty pedestals nestled among 78 statues paying tribute to men in Prato della Vella, the second largest square in Europe. Piscopia, who received her doctorate degree in philosophy from the University of Padua in 1678, was not included when Padua officials devised a project in the late 18th century to adorn the central island of the 90,000-sq-metre square with statues of figures who were either from the city or who had links to it. Originally there were 88 statues, but 10 statues dedicated to Venetian doges were destroyed by Napoleon’s army after it conquered the republic of Venice. Eight were later replaced by obelisks, while two of the pedestals remained empty. Critics of the new proposal argued that it was out of context with the square’s history, and that the last two pedestals should remain empty as they were a symbol of the destruction by Napoleon’s troops. In order to overcome the opposition, Colonnello and Pillitteri removed the caveat that Prato della Vella should be the location and opened up to erecting a statue celebrating a female figure other than Piscopia. Alternative suggestions include the 19th-century painter Elisabetta Benato-Beltrami and the writer Gualberta Alaide Beccari. “The important thing is that we have raised the debate about the under-representation of women among monuments and it is now very clear to all politicians that we need a very good statue of a woman in a very good place,” said Colonnello. “We now need to decide where and who. But I think we will eventually settle on the square – it is very huge and there is lots of space.” The proposal was triggered after Mi Riconosci, an association of professionals working in the cultural heritage sector, undertook a census of all statues of Italian figures erected in public spaces across the country and found that only 148 were dedicated to women. “This is being presented as a victory in Padua but for us it isn’t,” said Federica Arcoraci, an art historian with Mi Riconosci. “The point is that there are 78 statues dedicated to men in Prato della Vella and there needs to be one of a woman.”",News/World news,Padua plans first female statue – but probably not with the 78 male ones in main square,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/02/padua-plans-first-female-statue-but-78-men-may-keep-main-square
2/3/2022,"Although she was often described, perhaps with a touch of irony, as the “muse of incommunicability” for her dramatic roles in several of Michelangelo Antonioni’s films, Monica Vitti, who has died aged 90, always aspired to be a comic actor. In 1962, she had an offer to do a film for Agnès Varda, but turned it down; as she explained in an interview, “I want to remain loyal to Michelangelo, who has promised to make me the Carole Lombard of the second half of the century.” Though Vitti certainly had comparable looks and verve, and did eventually succeed in becoming a popular comedic star, she will probably remain in most film buffs’ minds as Giuliana, the complicated young blond woman in Antonioni’s Il Deserto Rosso (Red Desert, 1964), his first colour feature. Giuliana was perhaps Vitti’s most credible and identifiable characterisation. Her main concern is for her child’s neurosis, but she is not helped by her anguished attempt at a romantic relationship with an engineer, played by Richard Harris. The film contains one of world cinema’s most bizarre lines: “My hair hurts”, but it probably aroused merriment only when seen translated in a subtitle – Tonino Guerra, the film’s co-writer, pointed out that in Italian it sounds better.  Vitti and Antonioni had begun living together as he prepared to work on the film in which she shot to fame, L’Avventura (1960), but he did not tell her much about the part she was to play, either before or during its prolonged and hazardous shoot. She later said: “What I’d learned in drama school wasn’t much use on the rocks of [the Sicilian island] Lisca Bianca, where we were shooting under such dramatic conditions. Michelangelo treats his actors as objects, and it is useless to ask him the meaning of a scene or a line of dialogue.” Like most of the cast and crew, she had faith in him and the film, in which she played Claudia, the best friend of a young woman who goes missing on a deserted volcanic island. While searching for her, Claudia becomes involved with the missing woman’s boyfriend. All their hopes were pinned on Cannes, where the film was in competition. It was Vitti’s first festival experience, and the hostile reception from some of the audience at the official screening was a shock, leaving her in tears. She soon found consolation in the film’s jury prize, awarded after a campaign led by the film-maker Roberto Rossellini, which opened the way to her stardom in Italy and internationally. L’Avventura was the first in a trilogy said by Antonioni to be about alienation in the modern world, of which the second, La Notte (The Night, 1961), was arguably the best. The female lead was Jeanne Moreau, playing the wife of a disillusioned novelist (Marcello Mastroianni). Vitti, on this occasion a brunette, had the significant role of Valentina, a carefree society girl, for which she won a best supporting actress award from the Italian film critics. In the final film of the trilogy, L’Eclisse (The Eclipse, 1962), Vitti was paired with Alain Delon and gave another convincing performance in a complex role. The film was also jeered at Cannes, but it too won the special prize in spite of François Truffaut’s opposition. In 1964, Vitti returned to the stage, chosen by Franco Zeffirelli to play the Marilyn Monroe character in Arthur Miller’s After the Fall. I was in Naples when Miller came to see the production there and praised Vitti’s performance. After Red Desert, she had a lead role in Modesty Blaise (1966), directed by Joseph Losey and based on Peter O’Donnell’s comic strip. Her relationship with Antonioni ended in 1967; the following year she won the hearts of audiences – in Italy, at least – in Mario Monicelli’s La Ragazza con la Pistola (The Girl With a Pistol), playing a Sicilian woman who goes to London to seek revenge against the fiance who has abandoned her. In Ettore Scola’s send-up of Italian stereotypes, Dramma della Gelosia (The Pizza Triangle, 1970), she held her own against Mastroianni and Giancarlo Giannini; she was becoming the only woman to be bracketed (also in salary terms) with the popular Italian male comic actors of the 70s, appearing in one commercial film after another. She often partnered Alberto Sordi, matching his over-the-top performances. One of their best, with him directing, was a sub-Fellini subject, Polvere di Stelle (Stardust, 1973), in which they played two delusional music-hall comics. By then, she was in a relationship with the Red Desert cinematographer, Carlo Di Palma. He directed her in three films, including Teresa la Ladra (Teresa the Thief, 1973), a comic saga of a waif who survives the second world war thanks to petty crime. In 1974, she appeared in Luis Buñuel’s The Phantom of Liberty. Born Maria Luisa to Adele (nee Vittilia) and Angelo Ceciarelli, she later said that her childhood was unhappy, and, when her family emigrated to the US when she was 18, she stayed in Rome and enrolled at the Academy of Dramatic Art there. Her stage name came from her mother’s maiden name. In the summer of her graduation in 1953 came her first theatrical engagement, in the chorus of a Greek tragedy. The first film in which she appeared was Ridere! Ridere! Ridere! (Laugh! Laugh! Laugh!, 1954). She had several small roles in films and plays before meeting Antonioni in a post-synchronisation studio in Rome, where she dubbed the actor Dorian Gray’s part in Il Grido (The Cry, 1957). Antonioni was also directing a theatre company, and he cast her as Sally Bowles in John van Druten’s play I Am a Camera, for which she received good reviews, before embarking on his trilogy. Throughout her film career and relationship with Di Palma, Antonioni and Vitti had remained close friends, and in 1980 he directed her for the last time in a TV film of Jean Cocteau’s play The Eagle Has Two Heads, which he called Il Mistero di Oberwald. Vitti had begun a relationship with the photographer Roberto Russo in 1975, and he directed her in the low-key comedies Flirt (1983) and Francesca è Mia (Francesca’s Mine, 1986), as well as a TV programme in which she compered a debate with film and drama students. She and Russo married in 1995. In 1990, Vitti directed herself in Scandalo Segreto (Secret Scandal), co-starring Elliott Gould, about a woman who, while keeping a video diary, discovers her husband’s affair. Disappointed when the film was tepidly received, she found a new creative outlet, publishing A Bed Is Like a Rose, a delightful semi-autobiographical book in which she said that nothing could be further from her own personality than the kind of alienation with which she had so often been associated. In 1995 Vitti was awarded a career Golden Lion award at the Venice film festival. She withdrew, Garbo-like, from public life during her last years and the Italian media respected her privacy as she reportedly suffered from Alzheimer’s disease. She is survived by Russo.

2/3/2022,"Ronnie Fearn, Lord Fearn, who has died aged 90, was the former MP for Southport, Merseyside, and a most unusual politician. He succeeded in winning elections despite confounding almost all the expectations of modern formulaic politics and, without being a conventional intellectual Liberal, he was the ultimate party loyalist and committed activist. Before joining the Liberal party in Southport in early 1961, he had written to the local newspaper complaining about the Conservative council cutting grants to youth organisations – a cause to which he had a lifelong commitment – and he stated then that he only had “slight political leanings”. These nevertheless became enough to draw him into 60 years of Liberal campaigning. He won his local ward, Norwood, for the Southport council in 1963 and he held this seat through every change of name and local government reorganisation for 52 years.  Fearn was born in Southport, the son of Martha (nee Hodge) and James Fearn, a painter and decorator. He attended the King George V grammar school, leaving at the age of 16 to work for Williams Deacon’s Bank (later merged to become Williams and Glyn’s Bank, and later still the Royal Bank of Scotland), a career he continued until elected to parliament in 1987. He married Joyce Dugan in 1955 and they had a daughter, Susan, and a son, Martin. He became a member of Southport council at a time when the Liberals controlled the council in coalition with Labour. At the 1970 general election, the prospective Liberal candidate in Southport withdrew at the last minute and Fearn was persuaded, without much difficulty, to stand. In a disastrous election for his party nationally, he managed to increase the Liberal vote by 10%. This was the first of four contests until, in 1983, in a contested selection, the Southport Liberals chose a more politically focused candidate who, despite increasing the party’s poll, failed to win the seat. Fearn stood again unsuccessfully three more times. In 1985 Fearn was appointed OBE for services to the community in Southport. When he returned once more for the 1987 election, he became the party’s only gain in England. At the 1992 election he lost, it being argued that the town’s traditional Conservative voters were determined to make sure that Labour’s Neil Kinnock did not become prime minister. Despite the anguished representations of his successor Conservative MP, his local telephone directory continued to list Fearn as Southport’s MP, and electors carried on coming to him with their concerns. In 1997 Fearn returned to the House of Commons. At an election when the Liberal Democrats’ poll fell slightly, he achieved a swing of 8% in Southport. He retired from the Commons in 2001, bequeathing enough of his personal vote to ensure the victory of his Liberal Democrat successor, John Pugh. Pugh observed: “He was by no means a typical politician and if there is a book written about how to become an MP or a lord, Ronnie never read it.” Created a life peer in 2001, he retired from the Lords in 2018. Fearn maintained a lifelong involvement in amateur dramatics. He appeared in the annual All Souls Church group pantomimes throughout his time in parliament, though, with typical self-mockery, he switched from acting the dame to playing the baddie while he was the town’s MP. The productions played to packed audiences at the Arts Centre theatre. He was a natural performer and it seemed the usual politician’s need to be taken seriously simply did not apply to him. Unsurprisingly his appearances at the Liberal Democrats’ end of conference glee club entertainment were eagerly anticipated. He never moved from Norwood, the district in which his parents had lived and where he attended the primary school. He was the archetypal local MP, who understood what made the town tick and retained a real affinity with its residents. He is survived by Joyce, Susan and Martin, and five grandchildren.

2/3/2022,"My son Robbie Gordon, who has died aged 37, due to uncontrolled seizure activity, had a unique personality, and distinctive strengths and abilities. Robbie had a very rare condition known as Dravet syndrome, with epilepsy, profound learning difficulties and autism. He experienced difficult times that would have floored many of us, but always came out smiling. His internal strength and robustness got him through the many tough days. Robbie’s mother, Ruth (nee Melton), and I were both working in London, in a special school for children with severe learning disabilities, when Robbie, the elder of our two sons, was born. When he was two, we moved to Hastings, where our younger son, Greg, was born – he grew up with a sense of great love and protection for his brother. Robbie’s early years were incredibly difficult and Ruth gave up her career as a nursery nurse to care for him. There were no support groups that fitted Robbie, so Ruth and Robbie were always on the outside, and it was very isolating. Dravet syndrome was first recognised, by Dr Charlotte Dravet, only in 1998; Robbie had an ever rarer sub-group (of the SCN2A gene) and his diagnosis was not made until he was 30.  I had continued to work as a teacher, ending up as the head of a special school in Eastbourne that Robbie attended. Through my work, Ruth and I heard about Dr Dave Hewett and Intensive Interaction, the communication approach he had developed for parents and schools to use with profoundly disabled children, while also having fun. Intensive Interaction allowed Robbie to be Robbie, helping us to love and discover him, and allowing him to be relaxed and happy. Robbie learned not just to accept our presence, but to be able to receive and show love to us. He was in an environment not where we were always dictating what he should do, but encouraging him instead to be who he wanted to be, to seek us out, and to enjoy with us the sensory things that were his interests, at his level. He liked rubbing his hands through the leaves on bushes; feeling the bark of trees; touching a flower and grass. He loved beads and tinsel, the shinier the better, and sparkly lights, so in our house it was Christmas every day. Ruth and I wrote (under pseudonyms) a chapter in Interaction in Action (1998) about our early times with Robbie. He could not communicate with us, but he could express in his face and his eyes quite complex emotions – expressions apparently beyond his cognitive abilities. He was inquisitive, playful, affectionate and so loving. Robbie didn’t know how to carry a grudge, malice or jealousy – all he knew was how to give out affection and gentleness (not to say that he didn’t cause bumps and bruises as his ten stone landed when he threw himself onto you for a kiss, nose or forehead rub). In that respect, despite all his disabilities, Robbie was the perfect human being, with a pure soul, knowing only love and how to give it back. He brought out what was best in people. In return we wanted to make him happier. Robbie went everywhere – his family never hid him away – and, despite his actions sometimes appearing puzzling to some of the public around him, all who worked with him were always so proud of him. Robbie is missed by his many friends. He is survived by Ruth, Greg and me, and his niece, Elsie.",News/Society,Robbie Gordon obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/02/robbie-gordon-obituary
2/3/2022,"Tesco is to stop selling music and films in its supermarkets by the end of this month as it reacts to changing shopping habits. Entertainment aisles have already been cleared in some stores, with Tesco expected to replace racks of CDs, DVDs and Blu-rays with home furnishings. Computer games will continue to be sold.  The changes come amid a dramatic shift in how people buy entertainment, with the shift to streaming accelerated by the pandemic. Last year, UK sales of physical entertainment products dived 18.5% to just over £1bn as digital revenues rose by 8.3% to £8.7bn, more than the entire market was worth just two years ago, according to the Entertainment Retailers Association. A Tesco spokesperson said: “As more customers move towards digital entertainment, over the last month we have begun to phase out some products in our entertainment range, focusing instead on ranges where we see the highest demand from customers such as homeware and outdoor products.” Sainsbury’s made a similar move out of physical media last year, clearing out its final stocks of CDs, DVDs and Blu-rays over the festive period. It comes years after the likes of Woolworths, Blockbuster, Our Price and Virgin Megastores disappeared from high streets. HMV is now the UK’s only large-scale entertainment retailer, with more than 100 outlets after being rescued from administration in 2019, which led to the closure of about a fifth of its stores. Asda and Morrisons both said they had no plans to stop selling CDs and DVDs. Bryan Roberts, a retail analyst at Shopfloor Insights, said the changes were also linked to cost savings for retailers. “People are consuming entertainment in different ways – such as through streaming,” he said. “These products are a massive faff in terms of the supply chain and replenishing shelves and they are quite a low [profit margin] part of the store so homewares are viewed as a better bet.” The latest change comes as Tesco and other supermarkets tighten up their operations and strip out costs amid surging inflation on their main grocery goods. Rising energy bills, petrol costs and higher prices on all kinds of household goods have put increased focus on family budgets so that supermarkets are battling to hold down prices to win over shoppers. Tesco, already the UK’s biggest supermarket, won market share over the key Christmas period partly by matching the price of key items to discounter Aldi while offering a much broader choice of products. This week it has moved to cling onto that advantage with further cost cuts, including closing its nascent discounter chain Jack’s and ditching night shifts in dozens of stores, leading to the loss of 1,600 jobs. Tesco has also shut deli and meat counters to redeploy staff elsewhere.",News/Business,Tesco to stop selling CDs and DVDs in stores as shoppers switch to streaming,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/02/tesco-to-stop-selling-cds-and-dvds-in-stores-as-shoppers-switch-to-streaming
2/3/2022,"It’s time for Leonard Peltier to go home – to end his senseless suffering and 45 years of unjust imprisonment. Last Friday, after complaining of a “rough cough”, the 77-year-old Native elder tested positive for Covid-19. Peltier’s continued confinement at the United States penitentiary in Coleman, Florida, might be a death sentence, if the Biden administration doesn’t act quickly, and with conscience. Freedom for Peltier is one step towards addressing centuries of injustice facing Indigenous people as well as addressing the inhumane conditions of incarceration that have been exacerbated by the pandemic.  Peltier, the longest-held Indigenous political prisoner in the United States, is facing a potentially life-threatening situation. He is an elderly Anishinaabe and Dakota man who suffers from several serious underlying conditions: his age, diabetes, hypertension, heart condition and abdominal aneurism make his health precarious in prison without Covid-19 – and ever more dire with it. Peltier is locked away in a prison Covid-19 isolation unit – which is not a medical unit – even though the man who helped put him there has called for his release. James Reynolds, one of the main federal prosecutors who put Peltier behind bars in 1977, wrote to Biden last year asking the president to commute Peltier’s sentence and to grant him executive clemency. Why? According to Reynolds, the government had lied, deceived, used racism and faked evidence to sentence Peltier for two consecutive life terms in prison. Peltier’s co-defendants were found not guilty by reason of self-defense for the 1975 killing of two FBI agents in Oglala on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota during a shootout with members of the American Indian Movement. Law enforcement killed Joseph Stuntz, a young Native man whose killing was never investigated. Years of appeals processes have poked holes in the validity of the government’s theory. Peltier’s conviction in that case rests solely on the basis that he was present on the reservation with a weapon that day – not that he fired a fatal shot or had any hand in killing anyone. So why is he still in prison? It’s Leonard Peltier who now faces death. For months he, like many incarcerated people, has begged for a booster shot. Prison officials denied him one. Guards and staff have been observed improperly wearing masks or not wearing them at all. And now that he has Covid, it raises the question: who is to blame if the unthinkable happens? Certainly, those with the power to release Peltier must act soon or bear responsibility. Native people are building political power. The water protector movement that began at Standing Rock in 2016 was a watershed moment. Native people have made historic gains, such as the appointment of Deb Haaland as Secretary of the Interior, the first Native woman to hold a cabinet-level position. But still Native people face high rates of criminalization, incarceration and threats posed to their land, water and sovereignty. This is the chance to chart a new path, to reverse backwards and racist actions of the past. Millions have called for Peltier’s release since his incarceration. Nelson Mandela and Bishop Desmond Tutu before their deaths pleaded with the United States to free Peltier, joining Jesse Jackson, Rigoberta Menchu and Harry Belafonte and many more. Leaders in Indian Country have also chimed in. Last Fall, the National Caucus of Native American State Legislators unanimously passed a resolution calling for Peltier’s release, a movement led by Ruth Buffalo, a representative from North Dakota. The National Congress of American Indians has historically called for Leonard Peltier’s freedom. Many Tribal Nations have also continued to petition the White House. A movement on Capitol Hill is also growing. Numerous House Democrats have written to Biden. And Senator Brian Schatz from Hawaii, chair of the Senate committee that oversees Indian affairs, wrote a letter last week demanding Peltier’s release. Leonard Peltier’s defense committee is simply asking the Bureau of Prisons to follow its own policy. According to Department of Justice’s Covid-19 guidelines for elderly or immunocompromised inmates or those with co-morbidities, Peltier qualifies for release to home confinement. Any argument the government may put forward that he may pose a “threat” or “danger” to the community is absurd given the unjust nature of his imprisonment. Indian Country also wants their elder back. And the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, where Peltier is enrolled, has offered to house and to take care of a respected member of their community upon his release. No more suffering, no more death, no more tragedy. It can end now. It’s time for Biden to free Leonard Peltier.

2/3/2022,"Britain’s cost of living crisis is likely to intensify from Thursday as the energy regulator prepares to raise the maximum price of home energy bills by up to 50% above current record highs. The price cap is expected to reach almost £2,000 a year, up from an average of £1,277 this winter, to reflect the recent surge in gas market prices which has inflated supplier costs – and caused many to go bust.  Officials across Whitehall have been locked in talks with industry bosses for months and the watchdog Ofgem to draw together a set of measures which could cushion households against rocketing energy bills and a cost of living crisis. But what steps could the government take in the face of a global energy crisis? Here are the most popular options to emerge: Industry sources believe the Treasury may be poised to help cut £200 from energy bills by offering suppliers government-backed loans which could be repaid over several years. The £5.4bn plan would protect household budgets from a breakneck increase in their average energy bill from 1 April when the new price cap takes effect. But it could mean energy bills remain higher for longer as suppliers charge more to pay back their loans in the years ahead. The plan, first reported in the Times, was described as “entirely plausible” by one industry source, who asked not to be named, and is seen as one of the most likely measures. In addition to the Treasury’s broad-brush plans it is likely to also take a targeted approach to helping the most vulnerable households by doubling the payments offered by the warm home discount. The scheme provides a one-off annual payment of £140 towards electricity bills for households on low income or receive certain pension benefits between October and March. Currently 2.2 million households qualify for the support, but the government is expected to extend the scheme by making more households eligible and doubling the payment to help cover surging energy costs. It is usually paid for via a levy on standard energy bills, but industry bosses have warned the government against using better-off households to fund the expanded scheme. The top-up should instead come from the government’s coffers, they say. Energy suppliers and consumer groups have called on the government to scrap the 5% VAT rate on energy bills for months. The quick fix is considered a simple way to knock around £100 a year off an annual energy bill of £2,000 and has won support from the Labour party too. But the proposal has failed to win the favour of Boris Johnson, who last month described the measure as a blunt instrument. The prime ministersaid cutting VAT would “end up also cutting fuel bills for a lot of people who perhaps don’t need the support in quite the direct way that we need to give it”. He is understood to favour plans to target support for hard-pressed families instead. The cost of supporting government policies and green schemes currently adds around £159 to the average household energy bill, leading to calls for the Treasury to help households by shouldering the burden instead. Consumer rights campaigners have long argued against the “regressive” tax policy, which puts a disproportionate burden on fuel-poor households, and called for the government to pay for the schemes through general taxation. The Treasury is also reportedly considering scrapping some green policy levies, including the Eco scheme that pays for insulation improvements for fuel-poor homes. The proposals have triggered outrage from consumer groups, climate campaigners and the home insulation industry, which argue that the scheme adds only about £29 to the average household bill. Calls for the government to fund an energy bills cut from a windfall tax on the companies which have benefitted from the global gas crisis emerged shortly after the Spanish government set out plans to do so. Its plan targets oil and gas producers and fossil fuel generators, which have made booming profits from the surge in global market prices. It won favour with the Labour party and energy bosses including the founder of Ecotricity, Dale Vince. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said at the time that all options were being considered, but the measure is understood to be a non-starter for the Treasury which is wary about shaking business confidence after the Covid-19 economic slowdown and rising inflation.",Lifestyle/Money,Energy price cap hike: how might the UK government help with bills?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/02/energy-price-cap-hike-how-might-the-uk-government-help-with-bills
2/3/2022,"At least 60 people, including 15 children, were killed during an attack in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday, the latest in a series of violent assaults on civilians in the area. Armed men reportedly attacked the Plaine Savo camp in Ituri province, in the east of the country, with machetes and guns. Local sources who spoke to Reuters blamed the militia group Cooperative for the Development of Congo, or Codeco, for the attack.  The camp is home to 24,000 people who had left their homes and sought safety from violence. Following the attack they moved to the nearby UN peacekeeping mission, Monusco. The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said two students at a school it supports in the camp were killed and called on Congolese authorities to ensure the safety of people in the area. “Plaine Savo is populated by families – vulnerable families – who have fled similar violence with their children and are seeking only the right to live in peace,” said Caitlin Brady, NRC’s country director. “There has never been and never will be any justification for attacks on civilians. Those responsible must be held to account.” Edouard Beigbeder, Unicef’s representative in DRC, added: “This pitiless atrocity is evidence of the brutal scale of violence in Ituri, which preys on already vulnerable children.” Monusco condemned the violence and sent peacekeepers to the camp. Violence has been escalating in Ituri province in recent months, with at least 68 people killed at five different camps in the area since November, according to NRC. Last week, Médecins Sans Frontières said it had scaled up its response in the region. The Famine Early Warning Systems Network (Fewsnet) said conflict in Ituri displaced more than 13,000 people in November and December, with most living on assistance from local communities. Violence in Ituri and neighbouring provinces was disrupting food security, it said. Kivu Security Tracker (KST), which monitors violence in the region, said “edged blades” were used in Wednesday’s attack and that Codeco was suspected of carrying it out. According to KST’s data, Codeco factions have been involved in 61 deadly attacks in the past three months. The group emerged in 2017 as a coalition of militias that has since split into several factions. The militias are considered to be linked to the Lendu agricultural community, which has clashed violently with the Hema pastoralist group in Ituri. “The communities fighting in the area have been neglected for too long and we will not solve their problems with bandages and medicines,” said Davide Occhipinti, MSF’s project coordinator in the Drodro area of Ituri. “The Congolese state and its international partners need to take responsibility for reversing the dynamics of this vicious cycle that leads to more and more deaths, injuries and displacement.”",News/Global development,Calls for security crackdown as 60 are killed in DRC camp violence,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/02/calls-for-security-crackdown-as-60-are-killed-in-drc-camp-violence
