12/12/2021,"Anne Rice, the bestselling author of Interview With the Vampire, has died at the age of 80. The gothic novelist’s son Christopher Rice said in a statement on Sunday morning that Rice had “passed away due to complications resulting from a stroke”, adding: “The immensity of our family’s grief cannot be overstated.”  Rice wrote more than 30 books but was best known for her debut novel, Interview With the Vampire, which introduced the world to the saga of the vampire Lestat and moved from 18th-century Louisiana through the next 200 years. Published in 1976, it was made into a film in 1994, starring Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and a young Kirsten Dunst, who Lestat turns into a vampire. Audrey Niffenegger described it as Rice’s “masterpiece”. Rice wrote a further 12 novels in the Vampire Chronicles series – and was dismissive of the sparkly, vegetarian version of vampires made popular in Stephenie Meyer’s Twilight series, saying she felt “sorry for vampires that sparkle in the sun”, and that Lestat “would never hurt immortals who choose to spend eternity going to high school over and over again in a small town”. The horror legend Ramsey Campbell said Rice wrote “in the great tradition of the gothic, both thematically and in her prose”. “I would argue it’s a specifically female lineage that stretches from the classical gothics but in particular from Mary Shelley, in its humanisation of the monster and the way it accords him a thoroughly literate voice,” said Campbell. The bestselling horror author Sarah Pinborough, whose Behind Her Eyes was recently adapted for Netflix, praised how Rice had transformed the genre. “I have had a fascination with vampires since early childhood and when I found Rice’s work I absolutely loved how she took that genre and created such a vivid world and characters within it and, more importantly, made them feel so contemporary and relevant,” said Pinborough. Rice was also known for her erotic fiction Sleeping Beauty series, and for novels about the life of Christ and about angels. Written after she returned to her childhood faith of Catholicism in 1998, after decades of atheism, Rice said at the time that she “consecrated her writing entirely to Christ, vowing to write for Him or about Him”. But she later “quit” Christianity, writing on her Facebook page: “In the name of Christ, I refuse to be anti-gay. I refuse to be anti-feminist. I refuse to be anti-artificial birth control. I refuse to be anti-Democrat. I refuse to be anti-secular humanism. I refuse to be anti-science. I refuse to be anti-life. In the name of Christ, I quit Christianity and being Christian. Amen.” Rice’s husband, the poet Stan Rice, died in 2002. As well as Christopher, the couple had a daughter, Michele, who died of leukaemia in 1972 at the age of six. Rice started writing in the years after her death, telling the Guardian in 2010: “It was really a desperate attempt to be somebody. I looked around after my daughter’s death and realised I was nobody and nothing. I wasn’t even a mother any more. I had nothing.” Interview With the Vampire was published in 1976, and Christopher, who is also a writer, was born two years later. He said that his mother “taught me to defy genre boundaries and surrender to my obsessive passions”. “In her final hours, I sat beside her hospital bed in awe of her accomplishments and her courage, awash in memories of a life that took us from the fog-laced hills of the San Francisco Bay Area to the magical streets of New Orleans to the twinkling vistas of Southern California,” he added. “As she kissed Anne goodbye, her younger sister Karen said: ‘What a ride you took us on, kid.’ I think we can all agree. Let us take comfort in the shared hope that Anne is now experiencing firsthand the glorious answers to many great spiritual and cosmic questions, the quest for which defined her life and career.” He added that a public celebration of Rice’s life would be held in New Orleans, where the author was born and raised, next year.",Arts/Books,"Anne Rice, author of Interview With the Vampire, dies aged 80",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/12/anne-rice-author-of-interview-with-the-vampire-dies-aged-80
12/12/2021,"Being the member of the Monkees dubbed “the Smart One” was not an unqualified blessing for Michael Nesmith, who has died aged 78 of heart failure. As the songwriterly intellectual of the hugely successful 1960s pop group, he was deeply frustrated by the shallowness of teen idoldom. Throughout the run of the Monkees’ 1966–68 television series, he agitated for a larger role in the writing and playing of their music – which was largely made by more skilled session players and writers – while agonising over the very nature of pop bands. To hear him tell it, he had thought he was signing up to be a musician in a real group, only to find himself an actor playing one. It threw the introspective Texan, whose visual trademarks were a woollen hat and muttonchop sideburns, into a spin.  “What constitutes a critical path for a band? What defines the band? What makes it turn into a band?” he asked an interviewer – questions that probably never troubled his more phlegmatic co-Monkees, Davy Jones, Peter Tork and Micky Dolenz. Receiving no satisfactory answers, in 1970 Nesmith bought himself out of the remaining three years of his contract and plunged into a solo career that showed him to be not just the smart Monkee but the prescient one. Nesmith was in the vanguard of two major cultural developments, country-rock and the music video, and also turned out to have an eye for groundbreaking media projects. There was the 1977 album, From a Radio Engine to the Photon Wing, whose songs were written as mini-film scripts – predating the idea of the “visual album” by decades – while The Prison (1975), a novel with a companion “soundtrack” album, was an early example of a multimedia release. He was also farsighted enough to buy the master tapes of his solo albums from RCA Records, allowing him to profit when he reissued them through his own company. Later he was among the first to buy up licences to various films and TV series, profitably releasing them as home videos. Along the way he established the Council on Ideas, a brains trust that convened biannually to discuss the problems of the day, from overpopulation to lack of respect for cultural diversity. Eventually he even made peace with his Monkee past, occasionally joining the others on tours and new albums from 1996 onward. Born in Houston, Texas, he was the only child of Warren Nesmith, an automobile parts clerk, and Bette (nee McMurray). His father was serving overseas during the second world war when Michael was born, and his parents divorced soon after Warren returned. Bette and son moved to Dallas, where Michael had a “dirt poor, just miserable” childhood, with his mother struggling to make ends meet as a bank secretary. He was in his early teens when she created a correction fluid that painted over typing errors – the first of its type – and began selling it to other secretaries. She paid Michael $1 an hour to bottle it in their garage, but the business quickly outgrew her expectations. By the time she was bought out by Gillette for $47.5m in 1979, her product, known as Liquid Paper, was selling 25m bottles a year. At her death in 1980, Michael inherited half her fortune. The money came in handy. He had paid $450,000 to break his Monkee contract, and immediately afterwards had founded a well-reviewed but commercially unsuccessful country group, the First National Band (the name was a play on First National Bank, a characteristically sardonic bit of humour). There was more expenditure in 1974, when he set up Pacific Arts Productions, a multi-tentacled outfit that distributed videos, financed films (including the culty Repo Man and Tapeheads) and released Nesmith’s music. The title of his 1972 solo album, And the Hits Just Keep on Comin’, told its own story: his record company at the time was jostling him to make poppier material, but Nesmith carried on as he was, producing just one minor hit single, 1970’s lamentful Joanne, after which he never reached the Top 40 again. A career in the arts had been his only aim since his days at Thomas Jefferson high school in Dallas, where he was an indifferent student but never missed choir or drama classes. In his final year he left to join the US Air Force, and when he was discharged after 14 unhappy months, moved to San Antonio to attend college, where he met his future wife, Phyllis Barbour. Inspired by both Bob Dylan and Texas’s country and western radio stations, he was writing songs by then, and also playing them at small gigs, Phyllis occasionally singing with him. His first single, Wanderin’/ Well, Well, Well, released on a San Antonio label around 1963, was raw, Woody Guthrie-esque folk, but he saw his future in the hipper music scene of Los Angeles, and moved there in 1964. Another single, The New Recruit, recorded as “Michael Blessing”, did nothing much, but while working as “hootmaster” – master of ceremonies – at the Troubadour club, he did a set of his own songs one night (including Different Drum, later a hit for Linda Ronstadt) and was offered a publishing deal. His career was sidetracked, though, when his publisher’s assistant urged him to audition for a television pilot about a wacky rock band. Nesmith’s sarcastic screen test was singular enough to get him a job he was not even sure he wanted: though many Monkees songs are now considered classics, he did not like the music, and, despite managing to get a couple of his own songs on to every album, he chafed at being forced to operate within the group’s manufactured parameters. In 1967, arguing with the musical supervisor Don Kirshner about not being allowed to play on their records, he punched a hole through the wall of a hotel room. The following year, to distract himself from “this [Monkees] monster”, he released his first solo album, the all-instrumental oddity The Wichita Train Whistle Sings. His departure from the Monkees was quickly followed by the launch of The First National Band, a circle of country-loving musician friends who moved to the forefront of what became country rock. For decades, however, Nesmith’s boyband past kept them from receiving the same recognition as fellow travellers Gram Parsons and the Byrds. Later in the 70s he made what has been credited as the first music video, for the song Rio. Intrigued by the potential of adding a visual storyline to a song, he then developed a video series called PopClips. It ran for 56 episodes on the Nickelodeon channel, and was the forerunner of MTV. Nesmith went on to make an hour-long comedy-and-music clip, Elephant Parts, that won a Grammy award in the new best video category in 1982. Nesmith matured into a magisterial, philosophical figure – “Nesmith aims to express the Infinite,” proclaimed his Facebook page – who was known to fans as Papa Nez. In later life he wrote two novels and issued a memoir, Infinite Tuesday (2017), which barely mentioned the Monkees. He continued to tour regularly; in 2018, while on the road as a duo with Dolenz, he suffered heart failure and underwent a quadruple bypass. Eight months later, seemingly unscathed, he was back on tour with his own group. He was performing as recently as last month with Dolenz, on a Monkees “farewell tour”. Nesmith’s marriage to Phyllis, with whom he had three children, ended in divorce in 1975. He was married to Kathryn Bild from 1976 until 1988, and to Victoria Kennedy between 2000 and 2011; both of those marriages also ended in divorce. He is survived by his children from his first marriage, Christian, Jonathan and Jessica; by a son, Jason, with the photographer Nurit Wilde, and two grandchildren.

12/12/2021,"The word contempt, I learned last week, is derived from the Latin contemptus, meaning scorn. My 2008 edition of the Oxford English dictionary defines it as “the feeling that someone or something is worthless or beyond consideration”; a more recent article in the magazine Psychology Today says that “empathy and contempt are polar opposites”, and warned that the latter always has a catastrophic effect on human relationships. I was researching the word because of its increasingly regular use in headlines relating to the prime minister. Last Thursday, a column in the Financial Times was titled “Carelessness and contempt are at the root of every Boris Johnson crisis”. Over the previous few weeks, a writer in the Daily Telegraph has scolded Johnson for his “contempt for business”, while the Economist has accused him of treating “checks and balances with contempt”. Johnson has also been accused of having contempt for NHS staff, former coalmining communities, his fellow MPs and the population of Wales: it is rare that a week goes past without some or other story about this element of his personality and politics, and the C-word being used.  There are two elements to all this: one is Johnson’s Trumpish disdain for some of the most basic components of our democracy – the rule of law, scrutiny of the executive, an independent BBC (which he is now lashing out at yet again). The other is bound up with the prime minister’s apparently dim and disrespectful view of his fellow human beings – which, as revelations about Downing Street parties pile up, is now at the heart of our politics. The latest story, broken by the Sunday Mirror, has its own specific details: Johnson on a computer screen, merrily asking quiz questions while his staff “huddled by computers”, “knocking back fizz, wine and beer” in defiance of restrictions on social mixing. But one very familiar element is present and correct: whatever privations the rest of us were enduring, says one source, “the PM turned a blind eye. He seemed totally comfortable with gatherings.” This kind of contempt is there in Johnson’s serial untruths: lying, after all, often implies disdain for whoever the liar thinks can be misled. It is part of his strident ambition, and apparent habit of contemptuously using people and causes for his own ends. His Peppa Pig speech at the CBI was a case study in contempt for an audience. It is impossible, moreover, to separate this behavioural contempt from the disregard Johnson shows for conventions and institutions, because they ultimately boil down to the same thing, captured in the cliche of rules being for the little people. Remember what a teacher at Eton wrote to his father in 1982: “Boris sometimes seems affronted when criticised for what amounts to a gross failure of responsibility … I think he honestly believes that it is churlish of us not to regard him as an exception, one who should be free of the network of obligation which binds everyone else.” A justified retort, of course, would be that this is the exact mindset that Eton is designed to produce – but even in that context, Johnson seemed to be in a league of his own. In ordinary times, a prime minister like that would be problematic enough. But in the midst of the apparently unending Covid crisis, the impression of arrogance and impunity that seems to have spread from Johnson to his aides and cabinet colleagues now feels actively dangerous. As evidenced by the government responding to the spread of the Omicron variant with what it calls plan B, people are still being told to follow unprecedented rules and guidelines; and a more stringent plan C may soon follow. If politics and power were the right way up, those at the top would at least do an impression of being serious and consistent in order to rein in any irresponsible parts of the population. But in England, we seem to have ended up with the exact opposite: a dutiful public boggling at a clique at the top who are, to coin a currently ubiquitous phrase, “taking us for fools”: shallow, reckless, and apparently contemptuous of the sacrifices people are still making, which will soon enter their third year. Even now, with Labour suddenly pulling ahead in the polls and speculation mounting about Thursday’s byelection in Shropshire, do Johnson’s colleagues really understand how toxic this is becoming? The idea of the government smugly ignoring rules and obligations that apply to the rest of us is surely starting to define perceptions of much more than Covid restrictions. What, for example, of “levelling up”? The prime minister’s broken promises about the future of high speed rail have been widely portrayed as a fatal blow to the credibility of the whole idea. So far, the most visible aspects of the policy have centred on haughtily insisting that places compete for relatively trifling amounts of money; when the delayed levelling-up white paper finally appears, it will reportedly include plans to create US-style “governors” of English counties, but no new spending commitments. The “red wall”, it is safe to say, is not yet aflame with excitement. For all the hype surrounding levelling up, the absence of any emotional connection with, or serious plans for, the places the government says it wants to help is striking. Once again, the overwhelming impression is of contempt and condescension, and people being blithely offered something Johnson has no serious intention of delivering. Worse still, as proved by the national insurance hike, the end of the universal credit uplift and his regressive plans for funding social care, things that he actually has done will make lives in so-called “left behind” places even harder. As governments often do, Johnson and his colleagues doubtless thought such moves would cause momentary upset before settling into irrelevance. The problem with the “taking us for fools” narrative is that it provides a catch-all context into which these things – along with the controversies about Tory MPs’ second jobs – snugly fit. There are presumably people in the cabinet – let alone on the Tory backbenches – who are starting to yearn for a style of government that might be more serious, substantial and mindful of the lives of ordinary voters. Their problem, perhaps, is that once their party decided to once again draw its top brass from the alumni of English public schools, the die was cast. David Cameron had his own version of the politics of contempt: what else was austerity? Like Johnson, he had a habit of saying whatever he thought would either get him out of trouble, or bring him more votes. Once he had left office, his work for the defunct finance outfit Greensill Capital suggested someone only too happy to wring money out of advantages that 99% of us could only dream about. But Johnson is surely something else again: so arrogant and thoughtless that he sometimes seems almost amoral. I recently read Sad Little Men, the writer Richard Beard’s eloquent book about private schools and the kind of leaders they produce, which shines light on Cameron and Johnson via his own story of an elite education. In his experience, contempt for the lower orders began with the idea that “everyone else was less special and often stupid”, and blurred into indifference: “We saw from car windows the petrol stations and primary schools and Bovis homes in which less privileged lives played themselves out, but the hopes and dreams of these people didn’t meaningfully exist for us, nor their disappointments and pain.” The story of a public enduring the worst effects of the pandemic while Downing Street partied on gives those words an awful potency: somewhere in that sentence, in fact, lies one explanation for both the mess this government is in, and the mire the rest of us have been dragged into.

12/12/2021,"Alicia Keys’s eighth album – the follow-up to 2020’s guest-heavy Alicia – is a strange beast. A 26-track double album, the first side includes a suite of songs, (billed as Originals) that showcase a more stripped-back, piano-based sound, while the Unlocked side features beefed up, hip-hop-leaning reworkings co-produced by Mike Will Made It. It’s an intriguing concept that, when it works, offers a glimpse into an artist’s creative process, but when it doesn’t, feels like hedge-betting. Highlights include Old Memories, morphed from a jazzy standard into side two’s dancefloor goliath, and the original version of Daffodils, which pairs piano, delicate electronics and a lullaby melody to soothing effect. The ebullient, career-high Love When You Call My Name, meanwhile, works perfectly in both iterations.  Unfortunately, on some of Unlocked, the songs are contorted into ungainly shapes. Only You’s smoky subtlety is hijacked by crass dance beats, while the controlled drama of the original Nat King Cole is lost thanks to a slurred guest verse from Lil Wayne.

12/12/2021,"Over the course of his long career – he was a master draughtsman at 12 – the Japanese genius Hokusai (1760-1849) was so prolific it seems absurd that the west knows him mainly for a single work, The Great Wave. His many thousands of images were treasured throughout Japan. For sale as cheap prints – the Wave originally cost no more than a double serving of noodles – and in bestselling volumes in city bookshops, they reached every corner of the nation through travelling libraries. One of these volumes was to be an encyclopedia, with the flamboyant title The Great Picture Book of Everything. But for some unknown reason the book was never published. Hokusai made 103 drawings for it, known to scholars but out of sight in the private collection of a French jeweller until his death in 1942. Whereupon they disappeared, all but forgotten until 2019, when Timothy Clark of the British Museum heard word of them at an auction and managed to secure them for the nation. This magnificent exhibition, jammed since it opened earlier this autumn, is the first time they have ever been shown in public.  The first thing you see is the box in which these fragile drawings were preserved: a tiny house for such greatness. But the proportions are exact, for these drawings are no bigger than postcards. Black and white, in pen and ink, each is so densely detailed as to be encyclopedic in itself. Hokusai can’t draw so much as a cat without including an exquisitely detailed branch of hibiscus, then adding another cat for a bristling encounter. His drawing of a camel incorporates an orangutan crouched intently on its back, a shrewd black fox and a raccoon-dog flying off into the white space that remains. The world is both real and mythical. It is possible that Hokusai encountered a camel, and his image is charmingly accurate. But Japanese people were not allowed to travel, in his day, passing their whole lives in national lockdown. Like Dürer before him, Hokusai drew a rhinoceros without ever having seen one, but his is an appealingly antic critter with three horns, fur and a curious tortoise-shell lid. The encyclopedia was to be for children as well as adults. India and China were among its themes. Hokusai’s drawing of an Indian holy man is almost a mirror of his Japanese equal, but with rather less hair, both of them sashaying like elegant geishas. He drew a Mongolian warrior with a mild and weary wisdom in his ageing face – always such humane insights – and a Siamese traveller meticulously examining a length of fluttering silk. Whatever the foreigners of other nations might have looked like, they always acquire delicacy, wit and beauty through the art of Hokusai. There are many myths of origin. Three men brew the very first rice wine, with a Heath Robinson contraption involving pumps, presses and cantilevered poles upon which they balance to comical effect. Paper is invented by the Japanese, in a long vat of mulch; then the printing press; and then, fittingly, the fine black ink with which all three advances are depicted on this single sheet. This is all clear and precise, no matter how fanciful. Elsewhere you need the title (inscribed in Japanese on each drawing) to grasp what is going on in certain scenes. Two smiling men brandish what appear to be fizzing fireworks on long sticks in a rainstorm. This is the title: “Using the marrow of a red leopard, the Emperor Wu designed torches that remained lit even in torrential rain.” Radical, revolutionary, dynamic: Hokusai’s graphic notations startle every time. Rain strafes the page in needle-fine lines, sometimes crisscrossing, sometimes broken, its arrival upon some invisible surface described in a spatter of dots. Lightning flashes outwards in white spokes from a central disc, always blank, that reads like the moment of a nuclear explosion. Eyes are a staggering grammar of commas, hyphens, cedillas and full stops, minutely inflected to describe each individual face. Nature is stunningly personified. Waterfalls surge both upwards and downwards, their bubbles like foaming cherry blossom. Clouds are formed like rocks, in turn like blossom, in turn like frothing brine. You see presages of the famous wave everywhere (it was yet to come), flexing its pictorial claws, scattering foam that resembles snowfall, thickets of leaves and even a legendary Chinese rock in one dragon-slaying melodrama. Hokusai’s sense of humour is everywhere apparent, particularly in games of hide-and-seek for the eye. Spot the big bear under this waterfall (made up of miniature great waves). Find the moon among the shifting branches. A massive yet gentle elephant is tenderly cared for by two young attendants, but one of them is half-hidden behind the behemoth’s sheer bulk. Hokusai was almost 70 when he proposed this project to his publishers. He had suffered a stroke, the death of two wives, poverty and the intransigence of his grandson, whose debts he was forced to pay. Destitution beckoned. Yet even under these circumstances his vision never fails (nor his eyesight) and his imagination soars. The most beautiful image here shows a Taoist master ascending a ladder of clouds to pluck a pale moon from the twilight sky. It might be an emblematic self-portrait. Hokusai’s drawings are extremely rare. The creation of his woodcuts required the sacrifice of his drawings. The page would be laid over a wooden block; the carver would cut directly through the lines; the original image was thus destroyed. Sad as it is to think that The Great Picture Book of Everything was never published, and that Hokusai made no money, it is less of a loss when you consider the drawings reprieved before us now, revealing his first thoughts and gestures, in this captivating show.

12/12/2021,"Christmas doesn’t bring out the sanity in me. I like total immersion. I practically stud myself with cloves. No cereal packet goes undecorated. Punchlines like Frankincense Sinatra abound. I go all out for Christmas both in theory and in practice. The Christmas tree’s branches become my autobiography, crammed with ornaments dating back 40 years. I shop with the belief that good presents transform people’s lives. Emotions come at me in rapid currents: half the year’s turnover of feelings in 10 days. If I don’t have at least tonsillitis on Boxing Day – sharp scissors at the back of the throat – there is the sense I haven’t tried. When I was little and fretful and a bit forlorn, Christmas came to my rescue without fail. It wasn’t the world as it was but the world as it should be: the colour of things turned to the highest setting, shimmering with promise and possibilities. There were rewards for good deeds and hard times, gifts that would lighten and safeguard the future, mountains of food, on white plates with green dragons, with overeating – my weakness then – a requirement, not a crime. Chocolate money and tangerines for breakfast; pudding served with the heavenly quartet of brandy butter, cream, custard and ice-cream. My mother was a single parent to five children. Our circumstances were straitened in ordinary times. But at Christmas her best friend, Anne, and her husband intervened, taking us in and filling us up to the brim. There were towers of presents taller than I was. Donkeys called Sir Isaac and Josephine. I felt like the people on the Quality Street tin. I was so happy, the comfort and joy remaining in my system for months and months…  When it comes to Christmas I’m feudal in my loyalty. I won’t hear a word against it and when people talk it down I feel a spur to violence. Yet as each year passes I can’t always achieve the heights I crave. I want the sharp frenzy of old that is one part sherbet, two parts falling in love and three parts having your stitches removed; but the feeling I get is closer to winning the red-wine vinegar in the school tombola. I give Christmas my all. I wind the banisters with spruce and red satin. I make three kinds of stuffing and at least four sauces. I plant tubs of paperwhites, dust the mantel with fake snow, convince myself that stilton and fruitcake make a sensible sandwich, design a placement for the parcels in the stockings creating wild crescendos interspersed with sensible lulls. I pour capfuls of pine essence into the bath, emerging invigorated with queasy Hulk-hued limbs. I watch Meet Me in St Louis and On the Town on a loop, trying to lasso the perfect mood as I wrap. I’m not complaining, it’s my honour to do these things. And yet the mood can be harder to pin down than a cloud. It comes when it wants. Sometimes it doesn’t come at all. I don’t need Christmas to rescue me any more – perhaps that’s the problem. I’m no longer a huddle of needs to be scooped. The result is there’s a measure of estrangement between me and Christmas now. We’ll never be to each other what we once were. Sometimes I feel like a chapter in an earnest (s)elf-help volume, entitled Women Who Love Christmas Too Much. Some years I feel Christmas itself rolling its eyes at me, embarrassed by the lengths to which I routinely go. “She won’t be told,” it shakes its head. Perhaps elves at the University of Alaska like to research strange cases: “She needs to dial it down,” do they conclude, pointy-chinned? “I mean, who is she actually doing it for?” But in my mind Christmas’s allure and glamour are irresistible. Christmas shimmers into view like a 1970s stunt motorcyclist, fresh from soaring over 22 buses, and ambles over with toothy grin and beseeching eyes, shaking out its curls, and I know I should resist, my resolve is high and all I need to do is turn away politely, because I’m not going to put myself through it again this year. I’ll embrace a low-key approach and cut corners and simply aim for warm soft jolly calm. But before I know it I’m up in the small hours, melting Fox’s glacier fruits in a double boiler to make stained glass windows for the gingerbread house. Forget all your nonsense and just think of little children, people chide me, but I’m not the only person who finds the season unwieldy. I know citizens of six years old who feel mournful that Christmas doesn’t make them feel as it did when they were four. How to let none of this infect the Christmas dinner? Christmas cooking can bring out the worst in us, certainly. A friend came into the kitchen and asked her brother-in-law what she could do to help. “I’ll tell you what you can do, you can fuck off,” he said. It’s good to keep the cascades of emotion out of the saucepans. No one wants their parsnip puree garnished with regret, or sorrows in blankets or wry potatoes. Jokes help, of course, they always do. Katharine Hepburn said of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers that he gave her class and she gave him sex appeal, and I’ve sometimes wondered whether the same could be said of chestnuts with sprouts. (It’s a stretch.) The danger with Christmas cooking is the stakes are so high. Food and love are inextricably linked, but never more so than at Christmas time. It’s the top-heavy equations that tip people over. We all know a good square meal has the power to raise the spirits immeasurably. By natural extension it’s hard not to believe that a spectacular Christmas dinner might just reward and compensate the family for all the difficulties of the passing year. This is doubly true this Christmas when so many of us couldn’t be together last time. Christmas as medicine, salve and suite of medals seems more necessary than ever. It doesn’t help that we look to Christmas to measure how we’re doing. It marks a reckoning of the family’s successes and strengths, its compassion and compatibility, its basic fitness as an institution. How does it treat its weakest members? How quickly can its conflicts be resolved? And most painful of all, how do we bear the fact that not everyone is still with us? The misery of the empty chairs. It’s natural to want to pour a bit of Mum out for everyone with the gravy, but where’s the recipe for that? And we’re seeking profound consolation from bread sauce and red cabbage? In that case it had better be exceptional. Before you know it you’re not cooking so much as offering yourself as sacrifice. And yet, the provision of a splendid Christmas dinner in tough times is always a heroic act. Single people who allocated themselves all the trimmings last year, when Christmas was cancelled, had good cause for pride. It stood for something. Hope, I think. Even if it felt like rearranging yule logs on the deck of the Titanic. In my latest novel Loved and Missed a devoted mother invites her estranged daughter over for lunch on 25 December, but the daughter will only agree to a walk. The mother wants a park with swans and a bandstand – it’s Christmas! – but the daughter suggests a littered roadside strip of green. Undeterred by the dearth of cheer the mother holds her nerve and unpacks the Christmas dinner on a park bench, why not? “I got my courage up and spread three red-checked dishcloths on the old bench, placed some gold paper plates in a triangle, unwrapped the turkey sandwiches I had made, the meat half white, half brown, still warm, the butter glistening. I had chestnut stuffing wrapped in foil and I crumbled it over the meat, smeared on cranberry sauce from a coffee jar with the back of a spoon. I set down a paper cup full of sprouts on the bench. My hand was shaking. “Christmas vitamins,” I mumbled wryly, but they looked slightly fraudulent, as though they might have been pretending … I had a box of six crackers with robins on them in a carrier and I laid two next to each plate. I had forgotten the paper napkins with the holly sprigs. I propped a tall red candle in an eggcup and lit the wick, sheltering it with the curve of my hand, the flame hot on my fingers until the fucking wind blew it out.” No one says anything. Almost nothing is eaten. The meal almost takes on notes of a sacrament. When I have fears that Christmas will undo me I sometimes reread James Joyce’s short story The Dead. It captures the power a meal has to redress things, almost as though a big white cloth might be spread over difficulties, not to hide them, but as a way of asserting the value of harmony, order and plenty, whatever harsh or sad things may come after or before. The idea that things can be both strict and lavish appeals to me hugely – a good spread should call out to be captured in oils. In Joyce’s magnificent tale, the fat brown goose sits at one end of the table and at the other “on a bed of creased paper strewn with sprigs of parsley lay a great ham … peppered over with crust crumbs, a neat paper frill round its shin and beside this was a round of spiced beef. Between these rival ends ran parallel lines of side-dishes: two little minsters of jelly, red and yellow; a shallow dish full of blocks of blancmange and red jam…” I love the seriousness of this table. It is rare to see a feast that is as dignified as a fast. After the great pudding, a whole subsidiary course of “raisins and almonds and figs and apples and oranges and chocolates and sweets” follows. I always think a festive meal should have a series of false endings as though the table itself keeps calling out, “Encore!” The first Christmas dinner I cooked was when I was 28, newly married, and a grown-up life had landed on my head. I had 18 to cook for and new saucepans in descending sizes, but the whole day was cauterised by two strains of sadness: one brother in prison, the other in hospital. I felt the pressure mounting; streams of anxious calculations. It was clear to me that if only my roast potatoes were crisp enough, golden enough, fluffy enough, they would take the pain away for everyone. The funny thing was, they did a little bit.

12/12/2021,"Fully vaccinated people in England who have had contact with someone with Covid-19 should take a rapid lateral flow test every day for seven days, in a bid to slow the spread of the virus, the Department of Health and Social Care has said. The new directive, which will take effect from Tuesday, comes after “a significant rise in Omicron cases”, the DHSC said. It applies whether or not the contact is with someone with the more transmissible Omicron variant and applies from the day they are notified as being a contact.  People are advised to get a box of seven lateral flow tests free of charge from NHS test and trace either through pharmacies, schools or home delivery by ordering online, and then report their results. Unvaccinated adults must continue to self-isolate for 10 days if they are a contact of someone with Covid-19.

12/12/2021,"All forms of economic sanctions against Russia are on the table if it makes an incursion into Ukraine, the British foreign secretary has said, as she hinted she may be prepared to look again at the UK’s anti-money-laundering laws that are seen by some as a way for Russian elites to stash their cash. Speaking on the final day of a meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Liverpool, Liz Truss said that if Russia were to invade, it “would face massive consequences for which there would be severe cost”, amid fears over a Russian troop buildup.  The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia was being demonised for moving its troops within its own borders. Although all foreign ministers at the G7 – a gathering of seven countries that collectively represent 50% of global GDP – were clear that they had to send the strongest possible signal to Vladimir Putin not to invade Ukraine, there were differences of emphasis on the best kind of sanctions, and whether G7 domestic laws needed to be reviewed. However, ministers agreed they were facing a pattern of disruptive behaviour by Russia, and that it was simply unacceptable for one country to try to use force to change the borders of another. Truss replied to a question on whether she was willing to launch a review into the UK’s anti-corruption laws in the wake of global criticism that London has acted as a haven for kleptocrats. “We do have very strong anti-corruption and money laundering laws in the UK, but let us be clear, when the UK has wanted to send clear messages and achieve clear goals we have been prepared to use economic sanctions, so we are considering all options and together with our allies, including the US and our G7 partners, we have been very clear there would be severe consequences,” she said. It was not clear from her reference to “all options” how far Truss intended to go. The joint statement from the G7, which was due to be published later, warned Russia to stop its aggressive rhetoric, to de-escalate and use diplomatic channels including the Franco-German-led Normandy format. EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday are likely to announce the start of a process to impose sanctions on the Russian private military contractor Wagner Group. Moscow denies Wagner is linked to the Russian state but has said the EU would face retaliation over any sanctions on its citizens. The move is being pushed forward by France, which is concerned by the scale of Wagner group intervention in the Sahel region of Africa. Truss also said Iran had only a last chance to come back into compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal. Foreign leaders in Liverpool exchanged notes on whether they believed Iran was being serious in seeking a deal in the talks in Vienna, or was instead playing for time. Negotiators from Europe, Russia, China, the US and Iran have stayed in the Austrian capital over the weekend to work on a possible text that would see the US lift sanctions against Iran, leading to Tehran’s return to the nuclear deal. “This is the last chance for Iran to come to the negotiating table with a serious resolution to this issue, which has to be agreeing the terms of the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action],” Truss said. “This is their last chance and it is vital that they do so. We will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.” European diplomats claim that Iran’s behaviour cannot be seen as a true effort to secure a deal. It is likely that if talks do make progress at the speed required by the US and Europe, a discussion at leaders’ level will be called to decide whether to refer Iranian non-compliance with the 2015 deal to an emergency board meeting of the UN’s nuclear inspectorate. That would signal the start of the final collapse of the deal. At the same time, however, diplomats stressed that some progress had been made over the past three days because Iran was no longer insisting that talks focused on drafts the newly elected regime had prepared.

12/12/2021,"Creatures of Dust and Dreams is the first of Sarah Lianne Lewis’s works to be performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales since she was named as their composer affiliate a year ago. In this 10-minute piece, given its premiere by the orchestra under the baton of Finnegan Downie Dear, Lewis sought to reflect on the intrinsic frailty of the individual against their potential for gaining strength by reaching out to others. Conceived in 2019, pre-Covid, Lewis nevertheless recognised its resonance with the fears and uncertainties of the pandemic experience. Quarter-tones lent a brash edge to the buoyancy of the opening, with clarinet multiphonics adding to the abrasive element and an ongoing sense of unease, all of which contrasted wildly with the more straightforward melodic lines and far-from-dissonant harmonies. The initial playfulness and the musical material’s tendency to meander and periodically peter out – albeit perhaps redolent of the insubstantiality of dream – meant that the work didn’t quite carry the philosophical weightiness that Lewis intended. Nevertheless, her assurance in handling the textures was more than evident.  The revelation of this concert was John Woolrich’s Viola Concerto, written in 1992 and first performed two years later. Constructed as a cycle of songs without words, steeped in the melancholy of leave-taking yet at the same time consolatory, each of its seven parts contains the briefest of references to music from the past – Mozart, Beethoven, Monteverdi and Wagner – allusive, elusive, redemptive. Soloist Timothy Ridout gave a performance of exceptional eloquence and maturity, and Downie Dear ensured that the players, both in their accompaniment and in the expansive orchestral sections, matched Ridout in sensitivity. The sheer beauty of it all was mesmerising and, by the end, profoundly moving. After such emotion, Ravel’s ballet music Ma mère l’Oye (Mother Goose) and its fairytale figures came as suitably festive light relief. Downie Dear balanced the score’s moments of languid delicacy with the more vibrant characterisations that, being Ravel, never become remotely pantomimic.

12/12/2021,"This thoughtful documentary about Arthur Ashe, the first African American man to win Wimbledon in 1975, understands that representation is only one step towards equality. Born and raised in the segregated south, Ashe infiltrated the “lilywhite institute of top-tier tennis” just as the civil rights movement was gaining momentum. Yet for years he kept his head down, and felt guilty for it. The film charts his fraught political awakening, from protesting against apartheid to becoming an Aids activist, before his death from the disease in 1993. With his giant serve, sharp intellect and famously cool head, Ashe was pitted against more outspoken black athletes, such as Muhammad Ali. “We’re thought of as all brawn and no brains – I like to challenge that myth,” the young tennis player once said. Archive film is juxtaposed with contemporary footage of today’s sports star activists, including Naomi Osaka and Colin Kaepernick – a potent reminder of how expectations have since shifted.
