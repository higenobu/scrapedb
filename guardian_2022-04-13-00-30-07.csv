4/13/2022,"Millions across the world watched cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason play at Megan and Harry’s wedding. But only a tiny fraction of those viewers would have known the haunting Sicilienne with which his performance begun, or the composer believed to have written it. Maria Theresia von Paradis, once the darling of the Viennese court, a blind piano prodigy, singer, composer and music professor who performed for royalty throughout Europe, has since been erased from history. “She was deeply respected by her contemporaries – Mozart, Salieri and Haydn,” says Selina Mills, co-librettist of a new chamber opera about her life, with music by Errollyn Wallen. “They all wrote for her – and they most likely shagged her too.” Blind from the age of five, Paradis studied with Antonio Salieri, who composed an organ concerto for her, and established a successful career as a pianist and singer. She was so proficient at the keyboard that Mozart, by some accounts, wrote his Piano Concerto No 18, K456 for her, and her concerts in London saw her hailed as “the blind enchantress”. When she died in 1824, contemporary catalogues recorded that Paradis had written at least five operas, two cantatas, 15 keyboard works, songs and a piano trio. But, like Sophocles and Aeschylus, she was fated to have much of her oeuvre lost to future generations. Paradis has largely been forgotten as a musician and replaced – if at all – by a sexualised foil to the grand narratives of classical music’s great men. There’s a nasty little scene, for instance, in Peter Shaffer’s Amadeus in which Salieri tries to get his rival into trouble. “Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies,” Salieri tells Emperor Joseph, striving to thwart Mozart’s appointment as teacher to Joseph’s young niece. “One of my own pupils – a very young singer – told me she was, er, well, molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.” The singer in question was Paradis. “What happened to her became a joke in court. Courtiers would say: ‘Mozart is in paradise,’ says Mills. “Geddit?” If Paradis has ever come centre stage it is chiefly through the lens of her unsuccessful treatment by Franz Mesmer, the German physician whose theories of animal magnetism were tested out on the 18-year-old musician. That relationship was the focus of Julian Barnes’s short story Harmony, Hilary Mantel’s radio play The Price of Light, and Barbara Albert’s elegant film Mademoiselle Paradis. The last of these explored the bitter irony that when Mesmer briefly managed to get Paradis to see again, her musical talent seemed to deteriorate – opening up the the possibility that her artistry was dependent on sensory deprivation and raising the intriguing question of whether she would actually have been better off if she had regained her sight permanently. “People were always trying to fix her,” says playwright and co-librettist Nicola Werenowska. “For me, as a neuro-divergent person, that resonates profoundly. People were always trying to cure me of dyspraxia by coming up with ways to get me to tie my own shoelaces or improve my handwriting.” “The same happens to me,” says Mills, who is partially sighted. “I’m always having people say, ‘Can’t you get laser treatment, or an app?’” We’re chatting in a back room of Graeae, the theatre company named after three sisters of Greek mythology who had one eye and one tooth between them which they shared. Director Jenny Sealey has been deaf since she was seven. How, you may be wondering, does a deaf woman direct an opera? “It is not a world I know,” she admits, “but when I get scared it fuels my desire not to conform. Everything we do at Graeae is experimental and challenging.” Sealey has long pioneered a new theatrical language, creatively embedding signing, creative captioning and audio description into rehearsals and on stage. At rehearsal Sealey puts her cast through their paces, accompanied by a signer and composer Errollyn Wallen. Wallen’s score mixes jazz and other improbable musics with pastiches evoking the first Vienna school, as well as quotations from Mozart and Salieri. She was concerned to give the opera’s characters their own musical signatures: “It’s not just a question of characters having their own motifs but they often have their own key centres and rhythms.” The Paradis Files does not soft pedal the suffering its heroine endured at the hands of quacks and charlatans hired by her parents. Enter, at one point in the opera, Josef Barth, a specialist in using bleeding techniques to cure cataracts. “Let me examine your eyes with pins,” he sings. “Just a little discomfort.” Jan Ingherhaus, a pioneer in electricity, wants to apply charged pincers to Theresia’s eyes. And then there is the so-called master of bandages who wants to bandage her head so tightly that the optic nerve will function better. “Please stop it! howls Theresia, sung by mezzo-soprano Bethan Langford, herself visually impaired. “Get away from me!” Despite all this torture, The Paradis Files is decidedly not a tragedy, still less the depiction of a passive woman on the receiving end of patriarchal power. That approach probably stems from the fact that most of the creatives involved in the production are disabled women. “We all vehemently agreed that this would not be the core of our story,” says Sealey. “She really did not see her life as a tragedy,” says Mills, who points out that not only was Paradis a successful musician and businesswoman – after her performing career was over she set up the first school in Vienna for blind girls – but also an inventor. She devised different-shaped playing cards for blind people so she could join in at the card tables at court and designed raised maps made of pâpier-maché and a system of silken cords with different knots that she draped across her lap so she could so she could recall key and time changes while playing. When Paradis died, explains Mills, she left enough money in the bank to support her school for a century afterward, and, unlike Mozart, who was buried in a pauper’s grave, she was laid to rest in the family mausoleum in Vienna. “We were really committed to giving Theresia her voice after she had been silenced for so long,” says Mills. That said, much of the opera’s story is fiction. “I wanted to write about class so I invented the character of Gerda, Theresia’s maid ,” says Werenowska. There is also a Greek chorus of gossips who keep up a running commentary on the story as it flashes back through her life. Mills, who spent many years researching her book Life Unseen: The History of Blindness, says she was long looking for a blind female role model: “It was wonderful for me to find Maria Theresa von Paradis. She is the woman I’d been searching for.”  The Paradis Files, performed by Graeae and the BBC Concert Orchestra, is at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, on 13 and 14 April, then touring until 12 May.",Arts/Music,‘People were always trying to fix her’: the ‘blind enchantress’ who wowed Mozart,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/12/maria-theresia-von-paradis-blind-opera-star-errollyn-wallen-graeae
4/13/2022,"Trevor Noah returned to the Daily Show studio – and a live audience – for the first time in more than two years on Monday. A week after his Grammys hosting gig, the host touched on another awards show controversy: the Slap, which led the Academy to ban Will Smith from all its events, including the Oscars, for 10 years. “You realize by then, I Am Legend is just going to be real life,” Noah quipped. Is Will Smith’s 10-year Oscars ban a punishment or a favor? pic.twitter.com/l2a1dk2W1n “When I first read the headline, I thought this was the worst punishment ever,” he continued. “I was like, ‘10 years? The Oscars? This is ridiculous.’ But I got into the details, and I realize he gets to keep his Oscar, and he can still win Oscars even though he’s banned. So in many ways, this isn’t a punishment. This is a favor. “Will Smith doesn’t have to go to the ceremony,” he said. “He doesn’t have to dress up, he doesn’t have to sit through a bunch of boring awards that he doesn’t care about. He doesn’t have to pretend to be happy when he loses – I wish I could get banned from the Emmys! Every year I have to go and act like I might beat John Oliver. It’s a nightmare!” “I also think they should have at least consulted Chris Rock before choosing the punishment, you know?” Noah added. “Because if Will were still going to the Oscars, that’s at least four hours where Chris Rock knows where he is. Now, he could be anywhere.” In all honesty, though, “I don’t think they should’ve banned Will Smith at all,” Noah concluded. “I think they should’ve hired Will Smith to replace the wrap-it-up music at awards shows. Do you know how quickly winners will finish their speeches when they see Will Smith watching them from the side of the stage?” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert discussed reports that Russian soldiers stole dangerously radioactive items from Chernobyl to keep as souvenirs. “Well of course you can’t go to Chernobyl and not check out the gift shop,” he said, mocking a radioactive tourist: “Oh look hon, they have a T-shirt that says, ‘I had a nuclear blast at Chernobyl!’” As sanctions for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine finally begin to land, Russia defaulted on its foreign debt for the first time since February 1918. “Now, I’m sure you’re saying, ‘Steve, how bad is this for Russia’s cashflow? Is this like they lost their wallet? Or they invested all their money in Morbius?’” Colbert mused. “Basically, it’s pretty darn bad,” he said. Russia tried to pay rubles on a loan taken out in dollars, but was unable to since sanctions bar Russia from accessing its reserves in American banks. “None of the American banks are available to them!” Colbert exclaimed. “No banks, no Elizabeth Banks, no Tyra Banks, no Joseph A Banks! No two suits for the price of one.” In other news, Donald Trump endorsed controversial TV host Dr Oz for the US Senate in Pennsylvania. “Come on, he’s a conman! And so is Dr Oz,” Colbert deadpanned. In a statement, Trump said Oz had “lived with us through the screen and has always been popular, respected, and smart.” “Aww, grandpa thinks his TV friends are his real friends,” Colbert joked. And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel mocked concern by the House committee investigating January 6 that if attorney general Merrick Garland decides to prosecute, Republicans will smear the effort as a partisan witch-hunt. “Pretty sure that Titanic has sailed already,” Kimmel mused. “Any time any of them get accused of anything it’s a witch-hunt.” “So why not refer it to the justice department?” he continued. “If you’re worried about the optics of prosecuting, why do the investigation in the first place?” “How does this guy keep getting away with this stuff?” he wondered. “He’s the presidential equivalent of the Tinder Swindler. They could at least ban him from the Oscars for 10 years, right?” Kimmel also provided an update on the feud between him and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who tore into Kimmel on a podcast with disgraced Republican colleague Matt Gaetz over the weekend. Gaetz called Kimmel a “total jerk” whose “trend is to attack women”. “Says the guy who’s currently under federal investigation for sex trafficking, obstructing justice, and paying for sex with a 17-year-old girl,” Kimmel retorted. “That’s not fair at all,” he added. “I make jokes about men too. I make jokes about you, in fact.

4/13/2022,"You don’t need to have raised children to know that, at its core, parenthood is about unconditional love. We don’t get to choose them, and we may find friends and companions that we gel with better, but family is supposed to be that ultimate safety net. If your life is upended and all else seems lost, it should be a reserve of love that will never be depleted. Of course, parenthood also means disapproval, disappointment, even blind fury – but, for most, being rejected or abandoned by those who brought you into the world is unthinkable. For many LGBTQ+ people, however, it can be a grim fact of life. It has been more than half a century since same-sex acts were partly decriminalised, and 25 years since a Labour government was elected that commendably repealed anti-gay laws. But according to a new study by the charity Galop, a third of LGBTQ+ people have suffered abuse from relatives, mostly their parents. Among trans and non-binary people, that figure is even higher: more than four in 10. Statistics rarely convey the horror of what they account for, so consider just this one example. One young trans woman I spoke to couldn’t remember how old she was when she was first hit by her father, but she clearly remembers, aged 16, him drunkenly “smashing [her] against the kitchen cabinet”, then holding her by her throat “about a foot off the ground”. The provocation? She had kissed her then-boyfriend at a party in her parents’ home. Years of abuse took her to the edge. Being around men who reminded her of her father – whether it was because they smelled of his aftershave, were also bald, or were customers who yelled at her at work – would lead to the trauma resurfacing. Her wider family didn’t stand by her; contact with them has evaporated. “It sucks not to have blood relations who are sound,” she said, “but it is what it is.” It is common for young LGBTQ+ people to know, even in a vague sense, that they are different at an early age, and to panic at the possible implications. Adolescence is when the pressure to conform and “fit in” often feels most acute. For young queer folk, this can mean sleep-deprived nights full of cold sweats and panicked imaginings of how loved ones may react when they’re decloseted. These days, for most, what follows is affirmation: hugs, pledges to love them no matter what, that their happiness is all that matters. But it wasn’t so for the young gay woman who recalls her bigoted grandmother moving in when she was 16, using a homophobic slur and triggering a huge row. Her mother told her daughter that she couldn’t live with them if she was going to antagonise her grandmother “by being gay”, and demanded she pack her things and leave. Although she found refuge with her supportive father, she told me, her mental health inevitably suffered. Parents know what is best for their child, goes a well-worn cliche, but in too many cases this is demonstrably untrue. Pre-pandemic polling by Galop showed that one in five Britons still think being LGBTQ+ is immoral, and one in 10 thought LGBTQ+ people were a danger to others. That’s a minority, sure, but it’s still millions of people. Some parents may rationalise their failure to affirm in loving terms – believing that being lesbian, gay, bisexual or trans will lead to an unhappy life, without realising that such unhappiness is often caused by attitudes such as theirs. By depriving their offspring of unconditional love at a young age, they risk inflicting lifelong damage on their children, planting a bomb within them that may not detonate for years. According to Galop’s research, 92% of the LGBTQ+ people who had suffered negative experiences at a formative age had suffered lasting repercussions. “This isn’t a stranger in the street, this is your home, your safe place, the people closest to you who you trust the most,” says Galop’s Abigail Herbert, “so it feels as if there’s no one you can talk to when you’ve had that trust broken.” All research shows that mental health struggles are disproportionately higher among LGBTQ+ people; this, in turn, leads to higher levels of alcohol and drug abuse, all too often a form of self-medication. Almost all LGBTQ+ people have friends who need special support because they were robbed of the love that should have been taken as read. So when a young gay man tells me of his violent father calling him a “gay bastard”, or when a non-binary person tells me about how their family cut them off, I see parents placing their right to baseless bigotry ahead of their child’s wellbeing. As the great British anti-trans moral panic escalates ever further – framing the most marginalised minority of the LGBTQ+ rainbow as would-be sexual predators and threats to children – more of those ticking bombs are being set among a new generation. When encountering those for whom a fear of trans rights has become a life-consuming passion, it is difficult not to worry about what their reaction to their children might be if one of them revealed a trans identity. One trans woman told me of being beaten by their mother when they came out aged six; of since being misgendered and assaulted by their father; of having brothers pull out hair extensions and punching their chest; of being trapped for so long on endless NHS waiting lists for trans services that a family member told them to “stop this transgender madness”. It doesn’t even have to be abuse – with so few willing to push back on anti-trans talking points in the British media, many parents may simply be left baffled and lacking the emotional tools to support their children. As Galop underlines, with trans women too often unwelcome in women’s refuges, and a lack of specialist LGBTQ+ provision, many trans people are forced into potentially dangerous emergency accommodation, into homelessness, or to remain with their abusive relatives. For years, rescinded anti-gay laws and drastically improved public attitudes led to growing confidence among LGBTQ+ people. This may prove to have been complacent: homophobic and transphobic hate crimes are surging, and the ricocheting effect of anti-trans rhetoric creates an increasingly toxic environment for LGBTQ+ people in general. Stonewall, the main LGBTQ+ civil rights organisation, is under siege, and the Council of Europe has placed Britain in the same category for backsliding on LGBTQ+ rights as Hungary, Poland, Russia and Turkey. Such an atmosphere will embolden, rather than educate, those afflicted with anti-LGBTQ+ bigotries; some will have children who may internalise their parent’s sense of rejection. This should be considered a form of child abuse. No one should doubt the challenges of parenthood, that mistakes are made, that perfection is unattainable. But offering unconditional love costs nothing; depriving a child of it can cost everything.

4/13/2022,"Chelsea have had some great teams throughout the years, ever since the club was founded in 2003. But weirdly, neither of their two sides that landed Big Cup were, comparatively speaking, a particularly great vintage. The Fiver still has no idea how that first Mourinho team didn’t win the competition at least twice, for example, and it’s too simplistic to just blame Rafa Benítez and John Terry. Anyway, that’s not really the point, which is, they’re not that brilliant now either – Brentford, innit – and so The Fiver had assumed No 3 was a slam-dunk into the bag this year. But right now things aren’t looking so good. Huh? What gives? Real Madrid is what gives. Madrid are the kings of Big Cup, with a lineage stretching from the days of Ferenc Puskás and Alfredo Di Stéfano to modern heroes such as cellular communication enthusiast Cristiano Ronaldo and Scottie Scheffler wannabe Gareth Bale. They’re past masters at getting the job done, and their route to yet another semi-final appearance looks rather-more-than-semi-assured after last week’s saunter up and down the King’s Rahd. Madrid have a 94.44% success rate when winning the first leg away in Europe, you see, while Chelsea’s win percentage after losing the opening skirmish at home is a whopping zero. Disappointment appears a statistical shoo-in, then, not that any of us needed a calculator to be aware that misery is inevitably coming down the track in one shape or another anyway. But there is hope! While Los Merengues have only lost two of the 36 ties in which they’ve first secured an away win, they did make an awful sticky, crumbly, eggy mess of the bed just three years ago, when Ajax rocked up at the Bernabéu and put four past them to end their three-year run as Big Cup champions. Ajax’s first goal that evening was scored by a certain Hakim Ziyech, who will surely have spent most of the run-up to this match telling his Chelsea teammates that many of the Madrid side embarrassed in 2019 are still there, and can be got at. The only question being: is this Chelsea vintage good enough to take advantage? Their fans must hope so … but even if they’re not, history proves that being bang average usually turns out fine for them as well.

4/13/2022,"Human rights groups are calling for the urgent release of detainees in Ukrainian immigration centres, after allegations that conditions have dangerously deteriorated since the Russian invasion in February. At least 45 people are thought to remain in the EU-funded Zhuravychi migrant accommodation centre, a former army barracks situated in a pine forest in the Volyn province, according to the international NGO Human Rights Watch (HRW). Nadia Hardman, a researcher in the refugee and migrant rights division at HRW, who interviewed several men detained at Zhuravychi over the phone, said they were “locked up in a war zone” and were “justifiably terrified”. “They could see sometimes, from the TV, where the war was, but obviously, they don’t have an updated idea. And then there’s the sounds of war that they could hear, and they have no idea how far away that is or what that means,” she added. The centre is one hour from Lutsk and two hours from the border with Belarus. An airfield in Lutsk was hit by a Russian airstrike on 11 March, which killed two soldiers and injured six others, according to Yurii Pohuliaiko, head of the Volyn regional state administration. All of those detained in the centre were traumatised, said Hardman, some having escaped war in their own countries. When HRW conducted the interviews there were more than 100 men being held from up to 15 different countries, including Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Bangladesh. The Guardian spoke to a former detainee, Mohammed*, who was released from the centre on 18 March. “It’s horrible – it’s not for immigrants, it’s for prisoners. It kills your mind; you only sit, eat, sleep. You can’t think well. I struggled to sleep – you just stay awake,” he said over the phone. The situation got worse once the war started, and conditions inside the centre began to deteriorate, according to Mohammed. “We were scared for our lives,” said the 26-year-old, who did not wish to disclose his nationality. “All of us immigrants, we got together and we asked the guards to call their boss and someone came down and we said, ‘Civilians are evacuating from Ukraine, we should be allowed to leave too. Just release us.’ They told us no. They took our phones, but we managed to hide one and they beat us. They were laughing at us.” A video filmed by one of the detainees and seen by the Guardian shows a man lying on the ground, allegedly after being beaten by a guard. Mohammed says he heard explosions while he was detained and that there was nowhere to hide as the centre does not have a bomb shelter. “When the war started, the military came and took over one of the two buildings [in the centre]. The immigrants that were living there had to relocate to another building. We saw a lot of tanks, a lot of military equipment, a lot of troops. We were so scared. It was 10 metres from us,” he said. Michael Flynn, director of the Global Detention Project (GDP), said: “There is no justification for keeping migrants and refugees in administrative detention in situations of active warfare.” He added that international law clearly indicates the necessity of releasing detainees from these centres. “The laws of war, the Geneva conventions, require all sides in a conflict to take necessary precautions to shield all civilians under their control from the dangers of the conflict.” HRW said it is gravely concerned for the safety of those still detained and believes they are at serious risk. Hardman said they are calling on Ukraine and the EU to release those detained and for neighbouring countries, such as Poland, to allow all foreign nationals fleeing Ukraine to enter and claim asylum. A volunteer from the Global Society of Tigray Scholars and Professionals (GSTS), who was in touch with a group of male detainees in March, said that along with about 100 men, there were 30 women being held separately, some with children, the youngest of whom was four. The men told her that when the war started they were given dirty water which caused people to become ill and food was limited. Most of the detainees lived off a piece of bread a day, she said. Mohammed had been studying in Ukraine when he was caught by the immigration authorities for trying to work – which is not allowed – and threatened with deportation. “At that time, my country was in war – it still is – I couldn’t go back so I decided to cross the border into Romania.” But he was caught by Romanian border guards and taken back to Ukraine. He was sentenced by a court to six months’ detention and sent to Zhuravychi on 2 November 2021. He was released only after his embassy intervened. Other embassies have also helped in the release of some detainees, including those from Bangladesh and India. Mohammed said he is “100% sure” that there are people still being detained. “Some of the people tried to contact their embassy using our phone, but now we are gone. They need help. I don’t know why they keep them there. If they release us without going to court, why not them?” He added that the guards said they would give the detainees Ukrainian passports “right now” if they agreed to fight the Russians. “It wasn’t a joke, they were serious. We said no, we’re refugees.” The Guardian has approached the Zhuravychi detention facility and the Ukrainian authorities for comment. The volunteer from GSTS said some of those that were released from the centre in the first few days of the war are now being held in a detention centre in Poland, after they were arrested attempting to cross the Polish border, but these claims could not be verified. There are two other immigration detention centres in Ukraine – one in Chernihiv, until recently under siege, where GDP believes people have been released. The other is Mykolayiv PTPI (or Nikolaev Temporary Stay) in Voznesensky district in the south, near Odesa. GDP were able to confirm that it remained in operation with detainees as of two weeks ago. * Name has been changed",News/Global development,‘Scared for our lives’: grave concerns over safety of refugees detained by Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/12/ukraine-refugees-detained-russia-war
4/13/2022,"One of the Premiership’s leading coaches believes the introduction a 20-minute red card could help reduce the growing unease about the fairness of rugby’s disciplinary sanctions. World Rugby are understood to be considering the idea of a global trial and the Bristol director of rugby, Pat Lam, is among those who would back the proposal. Following a crackdown on upright tackles and head contact, there have been an increasing number of controversial red cards this season, not least Charlie Ewels’ second-minute dismissal for England against Ireland at Twickenham last month. Under an experimental law being trialled in Super Rugby, a sent-off player can be tactically replaced by a substitute after 20 minutes, thus restoring their side to full strength. The counter argument is that diluting the sting of a red card gives offenders less reason to improve their tackle technique, instantly undermining the game’s push for greater player safety. Lam, however, says there are now so many red cards being shown that sides are being punished to an unfair degree. “Red cards used to be for out and out foul play … someone punching someone or a real dangerous situation,” said Lam, whose Bristol side face Sale at Ashton Gate on Friday in the second leg of their Heineken Champions Cup last-16 tie. “But with the current laws around tackle height we’re seeing a lot of stuff. The rule is probably a good idea with the amount of red cards out there. Pretty much every week someone is getting a red card.” Lam, though, feels the lack of consistency surrounding some refereeing decisions is “the bigger issue” surrounding the sport. Last weekend Leinster’s Jameson Gibson-Park received only a yellow card for a dangerous upright tackle on Connacht’s Kieran Marmion while Leicester’s Guy Porter was sent off in Clermont following an accidental off-the-ball collision. World Rugby has yet to make a firm decision on the 20-minute red card proposal with the Super Rugby-based evidence regarded as inconclusive. Sources within the organisation, however, acknowledge there has been disquiet at some recent refereeing interpretations which may yet lead to a tweaking of the framework surrounding incidences of head contact. Lam, meanwhile, also believes next year’s European Cup should revert to its traditional pool structure. “I’m still a big fan of the original. I think everyone I’ve talked to liked the original format. You know who you’re playing and it’s the way to go. If we’re out of Covid, going back to the other format is probably the best way.”",Sport/Sport,Bristol’s Pat Lam in favour of rugby introducing 20-minute red cards,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/12/bristols-pat-lam-in-favour-of-rugby-introducing-20-minute-red-cards
4/13/2022,"Diego Simeone says that Atlético Madrid’s approach to the Champions League quarter-final second leg will not differ much from the first despite his team needing to beat Manchester City to progress. The coach also insisted that he would not be drawn into an argument about style amid intense criticism of his defensive set-up at the Etihad. After the first leg, which City won 1-0, Pep Guardiola said since “prehistory” it had been difficult to break down a team that play as deep as Atlético had, employing two lines of five. Some in Spain interpreted those words as dig at Atlético, and there has been renewed debate sparked by Simeone tactics. The Argentinian, though, said that he would not respond and appeared to call for respect for his approach, citing advice from his father, Carlos, who died recently: “It’s the mouth that kills the fish.” “I have been coaching since 2005 and I always say the same thing: I never do [comment], I am never disrespectful with colleagues of mine,” Simeone said. “I put myself in the position of the coaches I compete against and I understand that there are different ways of expressing what you feel as a coach.” He then drew on a phrase inspired by fishing which notes that if a fish keeps its mouth shut, it does not get caught on the angler’s hook. “When someone does not appreciate a colleague, I don’t share that. Others’ opinions: press, ex-players, people who haven’t been in the game a long time have opinions and talk … I’ll say what my dad always said: por la boca muere el pez. Words are free and we can all express an opinion. There are ways of acting among colleagues and I have one: respect others always, always, always.” Simeone said he had watched Manchester City against Liverpool, a “fantastic” game between two “teams who play very nice football”, and he highlighted the way that both sides had at times to “take refuge” and adopt “very clear defensive position” because of the quality of their opponents. He said he did not expect City to play differently in the second leg and admitted that nor would Atlético. “I am not going to get far away from what we believe in,” he said. “[But] hopefully we can combine better, have better, faster transitions, be more precise our counterattacks, that our most significant players can have a fantastic night. We will try to take the game to where we think we can hurt them. In a football match, anything can happen.”",Sport/Football,‘The mouth kills the fish’: Simeone refuses to bite on criticism of tactics,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/12/diego-simeone-criticism-tactics-atletico-madrid-manchester-city-mouth-kills-the-fish
4/13/2022,"Drug overdose deaths among high school-aged US teens have more than doubled since 2019, driven by a rise in the deadly opioid fentanyl, a new study has found. Researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, who analyzed mortality rates among 14- to 18-year-olds over the past decade, found that while drug use among this age group is actually falling, fatalities are on the rise, jumping from 492 in 2019 to 954 in 2020, then climbing to 1,146 in 2021. Researchers attribute this to a flood of counterfeit pills, which look exactly like real oxycodone or Xanax tablets, but actually contain fentanyl, a synthetic opioid so potent that one counterfeit pill can prove fatal. Vast quantities of these fake pills are being smuggled into the country and are circulating in the illicit drug market, meaning that teens often ingest the deadly drug unknowingly. “We’re seeing really young kids start to die, because the illicit drug supply has become extremely toxic,” said Joseph Friedman, who led the study, published on 12 April in Jama. The study found that the rates of drug deaths are highest among Indigenous and Hispanic teens, but that young people of all races are affected. “It’s scary stuff,” said Friedman, who said even though reported drug use among teens was at all-time lows, the deaths represented the major first overdose spike seen in adolescents since tracking began. “Teens are continuing to experiment with pills; the pills are just getting much more deadly.” A recent study by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, found that more than 2m fentanyl-filled fake pills were seized by law enforcement agencies in the last quarter of 2021 alone – an indication of how common they have become in the nation’s illicit drug supply. The UCLA study cited survey data showing that the number of 10th graders reporting having used drugs in the past year held steady at about 30% between 2010 and 2020 and then dropped to only 18% during 2021, as the pandemic stretched on. “A really important fact here is that more kids are not doing drugs,” said Morgan Godvin, a Portland, Oregon-based drug addiction researcher and co-author of the study. “The drugs they are doing are just incredibly more lethal.” The study comes at a time when the number of overdose deaths in the US has exploded to more than 100,000 a year due to the huge amounts of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids saturating the country’s drug supply. Fentanyl is as much as 100 times more potent than morphine. “These counterfeit pills are spreading across the nation,” said Friedman, “and teens may not realize they are dangerous.” While many adult users may know the pills they are buying on street markets actually contain fentanyl, youth most likely believe they are getting genuine pharmaceuticals, the researchers said. “Kids think that pills are very safe,” said Godvin. “Because, while they may not might not have been prescribed to them, they were supposedly prescribed to someone. And [young people] believe the purity does not vary.” In reality, though, the opioid dosages in counterfeit pills can vary dramatically. The Drug Enforcement Administration estimates that four in 10 seized pills contain potentially lethal doses. The authors called for more drug education in schools, giving kids realistic information about how to protect themselves from fentanyl. “High school might be too late,” said Friedman. “We need to include information about drugs on the street in school even earlier.” The researchers said youth should also be given education about and access to Narcan, the overdose reversal drug, which can revive someone who has overdosed, and fentanyl test strips, which can detect counterfeit pills. Researchers and youth advocacy groups say teens are often easily able to obtain the pills from friends or from local dealers, who offer them on social media apps like Snapchat or Instagram and sometimes deliver them straight to teenagers’ homes. Guardian interviews with families that lost teenagers to accidental overdoses from fentanyl pills show that it can happen to anyone. In February 2021, Sammy Berman Chapman, a 16-year-old straight-A student and the son of the television therapist Laura Berman, died in his bedroom in Los Angeles after taking what he thought was a single Xanax. In Arizona in 2020, Zach Plunk, a 17-year-old star high school running back, died after taking one tablet, labelled to look just like a pharmaceutical “M30” oxycodone pill. In both cases, the tablets, bought over social media, turned out to be deadly doses of fentanyl. Snapchat recently announced increased measures to combat drug dealing on the platform, while Instagram has said the company works to remove such content. “It’s just so sickening,” said Plunk’s mother, Wendy Plunk, who says there is still not enough being done to stop kids from getting the fake pills over social media sites and to warn them about the danger. “We need to get the word out.”",News/US news,Overdose deaths among US teens have more than doubled in three years,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/12/drug-overdose-deaths-us-high-school-teens-study
4/13/2022,"Extinction Rebellion protesters have forced the closure of the insurance market Lloyd’s of London, after using superglue, chains and bicycle locks to block entrances to the building. The environmental activist group said more than 60 people had been at the site in the City of London since 7am on Tuesday to prevent workers from entering and with the intention of closing the business for the day. Extinction Rebellion (XR), which encourages supporters to cause disruption through non-violent civil disobedience, said it was demanding that Lloyd’s stops insuring fossil fuel projects. Some of the protesters wore rat masks, while others were dressed as cleaners, with floral tabards emblazoned with the slogan: “Tell the truth”. Several activists scaled the building’s distinctive curved metal and glass facade, and unfurled a banner that read: “End fossil fuels now”. Lloyd’s, the world’s biggest insurance market, said it had asked employees and other people not to come to the building on Tuesday. It said the market remained open and trading was taking place online. A Lloyd’s spokesperson said: “Lloyd’s supports safe and constructive engagement on climate change and we’re continuing to work to support a responsible transition.” The City of London police said there had not been any arrests by early afternoon and officers were working to “facilitate peaceful protest”. Commander Umer Khan, from the force, said: “Police officers are working with key partners and liaising with Lloyd’s to facilitate peaceful protest and to provide a proportionate response.” XR’s action at Lloyd’s comes just days after its supporters blocked Tower Bridge in London, causing it to be closed for several hours on Friday. XR activists have also been staging blockades at fuel distribution terminals, as part of the Just Stop Oil campaign, leading to growing reports of shortages at petrol stations forecourts.

4/13/2022,"Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore has been edited for release in China to ensure any gay references have been removed. The fantasy sequel, which has an estimated budget of $200m, contains allusions to a romantic history between the characters of Dumbledore and Grindelwald, played by Jude Law and Mads Mikkelsen respectively. Six seconds of dialogue, including the lines “Because I was in love with you” and “The summer Gellert and I fell in love”, were taken out for the Chinese release on 8 April. “As a studio, we’re committed to safeguarding the integrity of every film we release, and that extends to circumstances that necessitate making nuanced cuts in order to respond sensitively to a variety of in-market factors,” studio Warner Bros said in a statement. “Our hope is to release our features worldwide as released by their creators but historically we have faced small edits made in local markets.” The studio insists that despite the cuts, “the spirit of the film remains intact”. While dialogue has been removed, there are still references to the pair sharing a close bond. Only 37 foreign films are released in China every year. While the film opened at the top of the box office in China last weekend, globally the opening was seen as a disappointment with just $58m from 22 markets, lower than its two predecessors. The news follows a string of similar cuts both for the big and small screen in China. In February, there was backlash when the re-release of sitcom Friends was stripped of its lesbian storyline, while the Sex and the City spinoff And Just Like That also aired with all gay references taken out. In 2019, Bohemian Rhapsody was released with any mention of Freddie Mercury’s sexuality removed and in star Rami Malek’s Oscar acceptance speech, the subtitles on Chinese television changed “gay man” to “special group”. While homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997 and removed from an official list of mental disorders in 2001, life under the rule of Xi Jinping has been more conservative and restrictive for many LGBTQ people.

4/13/2022,"An initial report circulating on Monday night from Ukraine said Russian forces had used “a poisonous substance of unknown origin” against Ukrainian civilians and military holed up in the besieged city of Mariupol. The victims were described as having “respiratory failure” and a rather specific diagnosis of “vestibulo-atactic syndrome”, nominally inner ear problems leading to dizziness and perhaps vomiting, eye twitching and loss of balance. There was immediate speculation that the events described were a chemical weapons attack. Liz Truss, the British foreign secretary, said the UK was urgently investigating while a Pentagon spokesperson said the reports “if true, are deeply concerning”. But some observers have expressed scepticism that the available evidence points towards a chemical weapons attack. A video from the Azov battalion, a Ukrainian nationalist group linked to the far right, was released on Tuesday on Telegram and provided a fuller account. It describes events and films some of the victims, who do not appear seriously harmed. The first, a middle-aged man, describes seeing “a white smoke” coming from the factory, most likely the vast Azovstal steel plant in the east of the city and one of two locations where Ukrainian forces are holding out. The smoke or fog, he said later, had “a sweet taste”. The man said he “at once got sick” and that he had suffered from tinnitus, tachycardia (a fast heartbeat) and that he had fallen over. “Mother lost consciousness and three times she was reanimated,” the man added. An older woman, filmed immediately afterwards in a makeshift bed, complained she was still unable to walk. A third victim, lying prone with clearly inflamed eyes, also described a “fog more like a smoke” after an explosion. “It was very difficult to breathe,” he said, and reported feeling dizzy, that his legs were “a kind of cotton”. A military commander concluded that “toxic substances” or “potent toxic substances of suffocating action were used” – but acknowledged it was not possible to engage in a toxicological analysis because the Ukrainians were living in siege conditions. It is too soon to say definitively what happened. One chemical weapons expert, Dan Kaszeta, the author of a history of nerve agents, cautioned that remote diagnosis was always difficult and questioned why, in the initial report, such a specific medical phrase as vestibulo-atactic syndrome had been used. THREAD #Ukraine #MariupolWas there a chemical attack? What was it?Well, let me say this about that (1/n) It remained unclear whether chemicals, let alone chemical weapons, had been used on the evidence initially available, Kaszeta said, adding that on the site under attack there was “lots of scope … for conventional or incendiary weapons to cause chemical problems because of fires and explosions”. Eliot Higgins, the founder of the Bellingcat investigative journalism agency, said the symptoms described in the video were “inconsistent with any nerve agent I’m familiar with, with no reports of pupil constriction or dilation, convulsions”. Nevertheless, it was critical for Ukrainian forces to try to recover any munitions used – the original report said the gas had been dropped by a drone – which may be possible because chemical weapons shells are designed to release their contents rather than explode. Azov has put out a video with details of the alleged chemical attack in Mariupol, with details of the symptoms from the attack. https://t.co/UAXqUcqo8M pic.twitter.com/bSBYNUXSTR Investigations at the UK Ministry of Defence are continuing, said James Heappey, the armed forces minister, on a morning media round, before going on to say “all options are on the table” in terms of a Nato response, if it were determined that a chemical agent had been used. Joe Biden did warn after the Nato summit last month that the west would respond to any Russian use of chemical weapons in Ukraine with “the nature of the response depending on the nature of the use”. But the effect of the incident – with three victims filmed – appears limited, and it is hard to see it provoking a significant military response at this stage. And with Mariupol surrounded by Russian forces and inaccessible to outsiders there is no prospect of an independent investigation of any of the victims. Fresh information could swiftly alter the picture, but for the moment the incident on Monday may not be as consequential as it was initially feared to have been.",News/World news,Did Russia really use chemical weapons in Ukraine?

4/13/2022,"Jim Cartwright’s northern fairytale is a little faded 30 years after its glittering first debut. Once the play that thrust Jane Horrocks into the public eye, it no longer feels surprising enough to warrant its repeated revivals. This time it is Christina Bianco’s turn to take the role of Little Voice – a quivering, borderline agoraphobic girl who only comes alive when mimicking the vocals of the female singers in her late father’s record collection. But when Ray (Ian Kelsey), one of the boyfriends of her alcohol-fuelled mother, Mari (Shobna Gulati), spots her talent, she is forced to perform for audiences outside the walls of her greying bedroom. In song, Bianco breaks away from her timidity and transforms into something wondrous. But it is Gulati who propels the drama as a flailing, brassy Mari. Dressed in a satin pink robe, she scrappily prowls around after Ray, desperate to hold his attention. Laden with crudeness, the jokes don’t land as neatly as they might have done in 1992. And the neighbour character, Sadie, has suffered a particular hit – the comedy poking fun at her feels dated. Aided by a sliced open doll’s house set, designed by Sara Perks, the production, directed by Bronagh Lagan, peels back the walls of the dysfunctional pair’s family home. And, with two blazing working-class women at its heart, Cartwright’s script still shines a light on the daily hardships of living in economic poverty. Little Voice’s teaching that “no one listens to anyone but themselves”, is significant in a Twitter-dominated world. But ultimately this is a play that has lost its sparkle.

4/13/2022,"According to the justice secretary, Dominic Raab, like thousands of my fellow criminal barristers I am taking part in an “unnecessary and irresponsible strike” that will “cause delays for victims and the wider public”. This comes as something of a surprise to me. It’s an odd sort of “strike”, given that we are, as usual, dragging ourselves across the country to crown courts far and wide, defending and prosecuting our fellow citizens by day, and drowning in unpaid paperwork by night. We will continue to work 80 hours a week representing our clients, and will continue to accept instructions in new cases, foregoing our families and our health in our efforts to keep our breaking, backlogged, starved justice system creaking onwards. So what is Raab referring to? Well, due to the historic chaos of the criminal courts, with trials overrunning and courts listing cases for hearings at the 11th hour, we have practised a system of “returns”, whereby, as a gesture of goodwill, we cover each other’s cases. If a court suddenly lists one of my cases for a pre-trial hearing, or moves one of my hearings to a different date, and I have a court commitment in another part of the country, one of my colleagues will pick up my “returned” brief, to ensure the hearing can go ahead. It’s a stressful business. A “return” can be anything from a short hearing to a multi-week trial, and we often don’t know we’re doing it until 6pm the night before, when the courts finalise their lists for the following day. It means having to absorb the minutiae of a complex criminal case – sometimes with hundreds or thousands of pages of evidence to read – at a few hours’ notice, and is the ruin of most attempts by criminal barristers to spend any evenings or weekends with their families. So to this part of the job, we’re saying “no thank you”. At least for now. The thing is, you see, we are burned out. One in 10 criminal barristers have quit in the past year alone, financially ruined by more than a decade of incessant cuts to our pay and physically shattered by the gruelling conditions of a defunded criminal justice system where nothing – even down to the court lifts, toilets and running water – works as it should. In October 2021, a quarter of those clinging on said that they intend to leave. It means those of us who remain have to take on more and more work, while real-terms pay continues to fall. These are not new problems. But they have come to a head because the government, having promised an independent review of criminal legal aid in 2018, and having delayed it until late 2021, and having then further delayed the official response by another four months, has now chosen to ignore its conclusions that urgent resourcing is required to stop the criminal legal profession collapsing. The Independent Review of Criminal Legal Aid makes for devastating reading. Its chair, Sir Christopher Bellamy, condemned the “years of neglect” by government, urging: “I see no practicable alternative to properly funding, and reinvigorating, criminal legal aid.” Bellamy’s central recommendation was an immediate increase of at least 15% above present levels. He emphasised that this was “the minimum necessary as the first step” with “no scope for further delay”, and that “further sums may be necessary”. Yet the government has refused to even meet this baseline. Its paltry offer – which will not reach criminal barristers until 2024 – will have been wiped out by inflation by the time it is paid. I know, I know – lawyers complaining about pay is unlikely to engender much public sympathy. Decades of political lies about legal aid have succeeded in convincing the public that it affects only undeserving criminals, and is something that noble politicians should cut back, if not remove entirely. But while the government would like people to believe this is a grubby dispute over money between posh, fat cat lawyers and honest ministers doing their best, the reality is that our justice system only hangs together because we have a cadre of independent, self-employed criminal barristers to prosecute and defend serious criminal allegations. If you are wrongly accused of a crime, you will need us. If you are the victim of a crime, you will want that properly prosecuted. Currently that is not happening. Justice is being denied to thousands of people every year. Part of this is because the government, having slashed every part of criminal justice to the bone – police numbers cut by 21,000, the Crown Prosecution Service budget hacked by a third, hundreds of courts across the country closed down and sold off – has run up a record backlog of 60,000 cases in the crown courts, meaning victims of serious offences are waiting on average two years – and in cases such as rape, sometimes up to five years – for criminal allegations to get to trial. But another increasing part of the problem is that we have a dangerous shortage of criminal barristers. Under the scheme for criminal legal aid, the government sets a fixed fee for a case, which is payable only once a trial has concluded. All the preparation we do for criminal trials is unpaid. This meant that, since 2020, when the government botched its response and failed to introduce enough Covid-safe courts to keep jury trials running, we have continued to work full-time preparing our cases, but have not been paid. Instead, our professional lives became a carousel of preparing a case in full for trial, learning at 6pm the night before trial that the court did not have room to hear it, and seeing the case then relisted by the court for a date on which we were not available. Eighty-three per cent of criminal barristers were plunged into debt or forced to live off savings during the pandemic. The most junior barristers, newly self-employed and excluded from government assistance, had nothing to fall back on. Figures suggest that nearly 40% of the most junior had to quit. The result is a sudden and shocking increase in serious criminal trials unable to go ahead because there are simply not any criminal barristers available to prosecute or defend. Previously, this was unheard of. In the last quarter of 2021 alone, it happened in 280 trials, a 50-fold increase on the previous year. Something has to change. Our demands are not unreasonable. We are asking simply for reasonable pay for the work we do. We do not expect the juicy private rates of our colleagues at the commercial bar. Nobody goes into legal aid for the money. But we do ask that the criminal bar not allow junior barristers to earn below minimum wage after paying essential memberships and expenses, because that’s the sort of thing that ensures only the independently wealthy can afford to practise criminal law. We ask that, instead of treating our pay as a political football to be booted about in the tabloids, an independent, apolitical body has input into making this a sustainable job for talented people. Raab says he is following the recommendations in the independent review. This is untrue. What is offered is, as well he knows, not even close to the bare minimum urged, and, far from being delivered urgently, will not practically be implemented for years. So when the justice secretary talks about “unreasonable” and “unwarranted”, these are certainly adjectives that have a place when discussing the problems in criminal justice. But they do not apply to us. We have worked 80-hour weeks, many of those hours for free, to keep the system running while this government has denigrated and lied about us. We have done so at enormous cost to our health, our families and our wellbeing. It’s up to you to fix the system you broke, Mr Raab. I, for one, am tired of having my goodwill thrown back in my face.
