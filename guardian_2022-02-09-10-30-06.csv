2/9/2022,"The deaths of thousands of fish in the Parramatta River triggered by low oxygen levels in the water is being investigated by the New South Wales environmental regulator. The Environment Protection Authority said it was examining two fish kill events, one last week at Haslams Creek, which flows into Homebush Bay, and the other at Rydalmere on Sunday.  Thousands of dead fish have been observed along the riverbanks. The events were likely due to natural causes, the EPA said, with preliminary investigations suggesting Sunday’s fish kill was due to storm runoff. High intensity storms result in large amounts of organic matter – such as twigs and leaves – being washed into waterways. An EPA spokesperson said this, combined with elevated water temperatures, had likely triggered a drop in oxygen. Officials were collecting water samples and water monitoring was set to continue. The spokesperson said it was distressing to see a significant number of fish had been killed and a variety of species were affected. Flood waters north of Menindee Lakes, which experienced mass fish kills in 2019, have also prompted authorities to warn there could be further fish deaths in coming weeks. Stuart Khan, the director of the graduate school of engineering at the University of New South Wales, said there was widespread concern about deoxygenated water in the Darling River and there was little that could be done to stop those floodwaters from arriving at Menindee Lakes. He said the weather would play a role because heat, and warm water temperatures were more likely to contribute to fish deaths. “DPI [the NSW Department of Primary Industries] is already preparing people,” he said. “It’s overland flow of water across the floodplains, particularly floodplains that might not have flooded for some time. “They build up all manner of biomass, sticks and leaves.” Khan said in areas such as the Parramatta River there was more that could be done to manage stormwater. He said if cities were designed to have more pervious surfaces – such as grasses, soils or permeable pavements – it could slow the pace of such events because water would infiltrate soils first before running off into waterways. “In a city, it is particularly at least a consequence of our own urban design,” he said. “The big problem is sudden influxes of water which comes from having lots of concrete.”",News/Environment,Parramatta River fish kill investigated after thousands found dead along riverbanks,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/09/parramatta-river-fish-kill-investigated-after-thousands-found-dead-along-riverbanks
2/9/2022,"The recent decision to make rapid antigen tests tax-deductible, rather than free, will deliver nothing to low-paid essential workers and big savings to high-income earners. How very Morrison government. While a part-time cleaner working in the aged care sector will probably receive zero benefit from tax-deductible RATs, someone earning $200,000 a year would get $9.40 back on a $20 test. In short, if someone is below the income tax threshold (as many part-time and young workers are) there is literally no benefit in something being made tax-deductible.  And while ordinary employees will have to prove that their employer required them to buy the tests, the millions of small business owners, sole traders and contractors among us will be spared the red tape. While it may seem outrageously contradictory for the prime minister to make RATs cheaper for those who earn the most and no cheaper for those who earn the least, in reality it’s a defining pattern of his term of office. Take the stage 3 tax cuts due to commence in 2024. Regardless of the result of this year’s election, the government’s lasting gift to those earning over $200,000 a year will be a windfall of over $9,000 a year. Those earning less than $45,000 will get nothing. Not a cent. According to Treasury the annual cost of the stage 3 tax cuts will be over $15bn a year from 2024, rising to more than $30bn a year by 2031. To put that into perspective, total commonwealth spending on aged care is around $24bn this year. And according to the Parliamentary Budget Office, about 75% of that windfall will flow to the top 20% of income earners. But while giving the biggest discounts on RATs to the same group who get the lion’s share of the stage 3 tax cuts reflects a consistent set of political preferences, it also represents a deeply flawed understanding of basic economics. The whole point of putting a price on something is to ration it, and the whole point of subsidising something is to encourage its use. That’s why we don’t charge people for bowel cancer screening, breast cancer screening or cervical cancer screening. Morrison knows that, and he also knows that the case for providing free RATs, as opposed to tax deductions for high-income earners, is even stronger than the case for cancer screening. While early cancer screening saves lots of lives and lots of money, the benefits of early cancer detection flow mainly to one person, while the benefits of early Covid detection flow to all the people who don’t get a contagious – often deadly – disease. Charging people to detect Covid early is like charging firefighters for using water during bushfire season. It’s not equitable to make people who are trying to help others pay a price, and it’s not economically efficient either. Just as increasing the price of cigarettes will lead to a reduction in smoking, charging $15 or more for RATs led to a significant reduction in testing, and in turn a significant increase in the number of cases, hospitalisation and deaths. While someone earning $4,000 a week can probably meet the cost of a $15 RAT without too much pain, that’s not true for someone earning $400 a week and, in turn, paying no income tax. Low-income earners are more likely to be young, more likely to work in retail, and more likely to spread Covid than older and higher-income Australians. The main reason the Morrison government didn’t provide free RATs over summer was simple: there weren’t enough of them. Due to a catastrophic failure to plan, even with high prices the supply of tests over summer didn’t come close to meeting the demand once Covid was free to rip. Making them free would have only made the lines longer and the government’s failure to plan clearer. The recent announcement that RATs would be tax-deductible is as inequitable as it is inefficient. The gap between those with the most and those with the least isn’t growing due to a scientific law of economics – it’s being driven wider by a decade of policy choices. It’s wasn’t “market forces” that decided to cut the after-tax price of RATs for high-income earners, while doing nothing to help low-wage workers, just as it wasn’t market forces that decided to give a $9,000-a-year tax cut to those earning over $200,000. These were political choices made by our government. Are these the choices we want our government to keep making? That final decision will be made by voters in a few months’ time.
