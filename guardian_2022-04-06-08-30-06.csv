4/6/2022,"In March, as the devastating war in Ukraine raged, Russian diplomats in Bangkok sat down for a meeting with the leadership of Thailand’s military-owned TV station. They had met, a statement by TV Channel 5 said, to discuss ways to enhance “cooperation in exchanging news and information”. Russian officials were ready to support efforts to tackle fake news, and to verify information. A week later, the TV channel’s boss abruptly resigned. Across the world, battles are being fought over how the war in Ukraine is discussed and presented. In Thailand, the tussle over narratives has played out not just on TV channels, but also on social media and at opposing press briefings and rival statements organised by the Russian and Ukrainian embassies. The Thai prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former army general who first came to power in a coup, denied he had intervened in Channel 5’s case or requested the channel stop reporting on the war – but has said excessive commentary should be avoided. Thailand, whose foreign policy has traditionally been likened to bamboo “bending with the wind”, has maintained that it has a neutral stance on the war. It did, however, vote in favour of a UN resolution that condemned Russia. Reaction within Thailand to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has often reflected the country’s highly polarised politics. “[People] tend to think of the Ukraine war in terms of their perception towards democracy or authoritarianism,” said Kitti Prasirtsuk, professor in international relations at Thammasat University. Prominent conservatives have expressed support or sympathy for Russia, while many young people, who have protested for political and monarchy reform at home, have rallied behind Ukraine. Conservatives describe Russia as a longstanding friend, referring to how, more than 100 years ago, Tsar Nicholas II helped Siam resist colonialist pressure. Vladimir Putin is applauded for his strong style of governance, which has been admiringly likened to that of Chinese President Xi Jinping. “They think Xi Jinping led China to be a successful economy, and that he is very decisive in taking measures against corruption,” Kitti said. “Conservative people are fond of that kind of leadership.” Antagonism towards the US, which some establishment figures accuse of stoking Thailand’s recent youth-led protests, has also shaped conservative responses to the conflict, he added. While outright support for Russia’s invasion is a minority view, commentary that is favourable to Putin has circulated widely on social media chat groups, especially among older generations, said Kitti. “In my LINE group every day people send Facebook links,” he said, referring to a popular chat app.Among younger generations, there is, however, a strong desire to stand by Ukrainians. “When you learn to fight dictatorship it is not hard that you will understand people who are fighting the same causes elsewhere,” said Netiwit Chotiphatphaisal, a Thai student activist. Some have even expressed interest in travelling to Ukraine to support its people, though it is not clear if any have done so.The Ukrainian and Russian embassies in Bangkok have clashed over the prospect of Thais volunteering in the war. When Ukrainian officials issued a statement calling for people to join their country’s fight – and news outlets reported that young people were intending to apply – Russian diplomats directly criticised the embassy, warning the best-case scenario for those who do so is “detention and prosecution”. Both liberal and more conservative voices in Thailand have criticised the west for its role in the crisis. Kasit Piromya, a former Thai foreign minister under Abhisit Vejjajiva, and once a leader of the yellow shirts, said the US had, for a long time, failed to take Russia’s security concerns seriously. Both Joe Biden and Ukraine should have entered parallel talks with Putin at an earlier stage, said Kasit, who is also a former ambassador to Russia. “With so much backing from Biden, cajoling and so on, then the Ukrainians became more confrontational. But at the end of the day, the country that suffers is Ukraine,” he said. “They were doing this more or less as a proxy or on behalf of the United States, and the western Europeans and so on.” Commentators aligned with Thailand’s pro-democracy movement have clashed over how Thailand should respond. Some have questioned the accuracy of information provided by western media and suggested that it is better for Thailand not to pick a side. Piyabutr Saengkanokkul, founder of Future Forward, a progressive party that has riled the establishment and has since been dissolved by the constitutional court, said some commentary about the war sounded as if it were based on a Hollywood movie plot where Russia is “a forever bad guy”. He later clarified that he condemned Russia’s invasion, calling it a violation of international law. The Thai government faces an awkward balancing act. Russia is not a key trading partner, but, post-Covid, Russians have accounted for one of the largest groups of tourists arriving in Thailand. Later this year Thailand will chair the Apec summit, where 21 nations including Russia, the US and China with gather.Prayuth said all news media should avoid giving too much analysis. Doing so, he said, “will cause problems to the overall image of our country”.",News/World news,"In Thailand, the war in Ukraine divides the generations",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/06/in-thailand-the-war-in-ukraine-divides-the-generations
4/6/2022,"A rise in Covid infections in the over-55s could see an increased number of hospitalisations and deaths in the coming weeks, experts have warned. Imperial College London’s latest React-1 study found that while infections appeared to be slowing down or plateauing in most younger age groups in England, they were rising in over-55s, with no clear sign of when they will peak. According to their latest data, the average prevalence of Covid-19 across England stood at 6.4%, based on swabs collected between 9 and 31 March from a random sample of nearly 100,000 people. “That’s by far the highest we’ve seen at any time since [the study began] in May 2020,” said Prof Paul Elliott, who led the research. The south-west had the highest infection rate at 8.13%, and West Midlands the lowest at 5.28%, with reliable increases in infections observed in all English regions apart from London. Among those aged 55 and over, the estimated prevalence on 31 March stood at 8.31%. “This is around 20 times higher than the average for that group across the whole period from May 2020 through to March 2022, so these are absolutely unprecedentedly high levels,” Elliott said. “Obviously there’s the vaccination programme, which has been hugely important in protecting us as a population, but if you see more infection, you would generally expect to see more severe outcomes [such as hospitalisations and deaths],” added Prof Christl Donnelly at Imperial College London, who was also involved in the study. “We don’t yet know when we’ll see a peak in the over-55 age group, and because those people are at higher risk of severe outcomes that is a particular worry.” The team also identified eight cases involving “recombinant” forms of the coronavirus, which can occur when a person is infected with two variants at once, including five of the XE variant, a combination of Omicron BA.1 and BA.2. Separate data has suggested this is spreading about 10% faster than BA.2 in the UK, with 637 cases identified as of 22 March. The figures came as the latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that Covid-related deaths in England have jumped to their highest level since mid-February. There were 780 deaths where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate in the seven days leading up to 25 March – up 14% on the previous week. This increase follows several weeks where deaths appeared to have levelled off. Coronavirus infections have been rising across the UK since early March, driven by the Omicron BA.2 variant. Prevalence of the virus is currently at a record high, with ONS figures suggesting approximately 4.9 million people had Covid in the week to 26 March. This increase may now be having an impact on the number of deaths, which typically lag behind infections by several weeks. The death toll is the highest since 18 February when 863 deaths were recorded – although this is still lower than at the peak of the first Omicron wave when 1,484 deaths were registered in England and Wales in the week to 21 January. It is also well below the 8,433 deaths registered at the peak of the second wave of coronavirus in the week to 29 January 2021. In total 190,053 deaths have now occurred in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, according to the ONS. The number of people in hospital in the UK with coronavirus is close to the total reached at the start of this year but is still far below levels recorded in early 2021. This relatively low number of deaths and hospitalisations largely reflects the success of the vaccination programme – in particular the rollout of booster doses at the end of 2021. A fourth “spring booster” dose of vaccine is being offered to people aged 75 and over, care home residents and those aged 12 and over with weakened immune systems. Wednesday’s React-1 figures are the last that will be published by the study group, as the government has now axed funding for the project. Throughout the pandemic, it has played a key role in tracking the spread of Covid-19 infections in the community, alongside the ONS study, which will continue. Elliott said he was “extremely proud” of what the study had achieved, providing “very rapid, real-time information that we endeavoured to report very quickly to the public, to the press, as well as to the government. “There will be a bit of a loss. But I’m very hopeful that with the [ONS study] continuing we will still be ahead of other countries in terms of population level surveillance.”",News/World news,Covid deaths in England may rise as cases in over-55s increase,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/06/covid-deaths-in-england-may-rise-as-cases-in-over-55s-increase
4/6/2022,"Buried in forest litter or sprouting from trees, fungi might give the impression of being silent and relatively self-contained organisms, but a new study suggests they may be champignon communicators. Mathematical analysis of the electrical signals fungi seemingly send to one another has identified patterns that bear a striking structural similarity to human speech. Previous research has suggested that fungi conduct electrical impulses through long, underground filamentous structures called hyphae – similar to how nerve cells transmit information in humans. It has even shown that the firing rate of these impulses increases when the hyphae of wood-digesting fungi come into contact with wooden blocks, raising the possibility that fungi use this electrical “language” to share information about food or injury with distant parts of themselves, or with hyphae-connected partners such as trees. But do these trains of electrical activity have anything in common with human language? To investigate, Prof Andrew Adamatzky at the University of the West of England’s unconventional computing laboratory in Bristol analysed the patterns of electrical spikes generated by four species of fungi – enoki, split gill, ghost and caterpillar fungi. He did this by inserting tiny microelectrodes into substrates colonised by their patchwork of hyphae threads, their mycelia. “We do not know if there is a direct relationship between spiking patterns in fungi and human speech. Possibly not,” Adamatzky said. “On the other hand, there are many similarities in information processing in living substrates of different classes, families and species. I was just curious to compare.” The research, published in Royal Society Open Science, found that these spikes often clustered into trains of activity, resembling vocabularies of up to 50 words, and that the distribution of these “fungal word lengths” closely matched those of human languages. Split gills – which grow on decaying wood, and whose fruiting bodies resemble undulating waves of tightly packed coral – generated the most complex “sentences” of all. The most likely reasons for these waves of electrical activity are to maintain the fungi’s integrity – analogous to wolves howling to maintain the integrity of the pack – or to report newly discovered sources of attractants and repellants to other parts of their mycelia, Adamtzky suggested. “There is also another option – they are saying nothing,” he said. “Propagating mycelium tips are electrically charged, and, therefore, when the charged tips pass in a pair of differential electrodes, a spike in the potential difference is recorded.” Whatever these “spiking events” represent, they do not appear to be random, he added. Even so, other scientists would like to see more evidence before they are willing to accept them as a form of language. Other types of pulsing behaviour have previously been recorded in fungal networks, such as pulsing nutrient transport – possibly caused by rhythmic growth as fungi forage for food. “This new paper detects rhythmic patterns in electric signals, of a similar frequency as the nutrient pulses we found,” said Dan Bebber, an associate professor of biosciences at the University of Exeter, and a member of the British Mycological Society’s fungal biology research committee. “Though interesting, the interpretation as language seems somewhat overenthusiastic, and would require far more research and testing of critical hypotheses before we see ‘Fungus’ on Google Translate.”",News/Science,Fungi seeks similar: scientist investigates mushroom ‘chat’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/06/fungi-electrical-impulses-human-language-study
4/6/2022,"Two Lidl adverts claiming shoppers could make big savings compared with Tesco have been banned after a complaint from the rival discounter Aldi. The advertising watchdog said it was banning the ads, one of which claimed it was possible to save more than 35% and another 30% compared with Tesco prices on a range of Scottish-themed products, as they were “likely to mislead”. It said it did not consider that the ads, which ran in Scotland, made it “sufficiently clear” that the savings related only to the specific selection of products shown. “We considered consumers (in Scotland) would be likely to understand the savings referred to price differences offered by the two supermarkets more widely, rather than being specific only to the example basket of goods, and that the same level of savings could be achieved more generally in a typical weekly shop,” the Advertising Standards Authority said in a statement. “Because we had not seen evidence that this general level of savings could ordinarily be achieved, we considered the ads were likely to mislead.” Lidl said the ads were specific comparisons of the products shown and it did not believe the average consumer could not reasonably conclude that its prices were generally cheaper than Tesco’s. The ban reprises a battle over pricing claims between Aldi, Lidl and Tesco three years after similar rulings against both the German discounters in relation to price comparisons with the UK’s biggest supermarket. A Tesco ad which claimed its Exclusively at Tesco ranges were cheaper than both Aldi and Lidl was also banned and deemed misleading in 2019 as it did not make clear the products were not available in smaller stores. An earlier series of ads in 2016, in which Aldi claimed shoppers could make big savings compared with the “big four” supermarkets – Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons – were also banned as misleading. The revival of the battle over price claims comes as shoppers look for savings amid a surge in the cost of living with rapid inflation in household energy bills, petrol prices and food costs. The latest industry data indicates that families have begun turning to the discounters in an attempt to save money, handing Aldi and Lidl a bigger share of the weekly shop.",News/Business, Two Lidl ads banned over ‘misleading’ Tesco price comparison,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/06/two-lidl-ads-banned-over-misleading-tesco-price-comparison
4/6/2022,"If you wanted a great portrait in early 16th-century Italy, or a few rooms filling with frescoes, or even a bathroom doing, Raphael was your artist – ahead of his contemporaries Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. He could paint with as much authority as Leonardo, but without the long delays and distractions to which the older genius was prone as he paused commissions to build a flying machine or simply do maths for a few months. As for the other artistic titan of the time, Raphael cruelly satirised Michelangelo in his fresco The School of Athens, which is spectacularly recreated in this show as a wall-filling facsimile. Michelangelo is depicted in this great vision of classical Greece as the philosopher Heraclitus, sitting by himself, a grumpy loner with his face resting in his hand in the attribute of melancholy. Raphael was well-dressed and charming. Of the big three of the High Renaissance, he was the most straightforward, the most productive, and for 300 years, the most influential. When he was in his early 20s he saw the Mona Lisa and other works by Leonardo and transfigured their style into his own, as you can see here in his 1507-8 painting La Muta of a woman with Mona Lisa-like mystery and reserve. The adaptation he made to Leonardo’s style was a sensational success – honing the classical noses and poses, but removing the bizarre chiaroscuro. This created a noble, balanced, clear figurative art that was taught for centuries as the correct, perfect style, until modernism knocked it off its pedestal. This exhibition makes you feel the original joy of that pure, almost mathematical method. Raphael’s Madonnas are so serenely composed, so light and gracious in their colours, they seem to float up in the air without needing to be fixed to the wall. The Alba Madonna is a circular painting (a “tondo”) in vibrant blue and pink, with the young Jesus and John the Baptist playing in Mary’s lap in a meadow. Beyond, the landscape is a misty blueish veil of mountains and water under a clear bright sky. But what’s uncanny is the sense of proportion: Mary and the boys are exactly where they need to be inside the circle to make this feel like a geometrical theorem. Raphael makes the music of the spheres visible. To say the Renaissance was driven by admiration for ancient Greece and Rome is a cliche, but it was Raphael who took that ideal to the extreme. There’s a letter in this exhibition from the Vatican library in which Raphael tells Pope Leo X about his research into the ancient remains of Rome. He has studied the ruins alongside ancient texts, he says. One book was Vitruvius’s On Architecture, which explains the theory of perfect proportion – how a building or human body should be planned by musical intervals. Raphael even does this in The Massacre of the Innocents that he designed as a print with his collaborator, the engraver Marcantonio Raimondi. It is a scene of mass infanticide yet the nude soldiers move like ballet dancers, and the women pose like statues, in a stately parade of pain. Cold? Not for one second. Raphael’s classical calm does not mute the horror so much as give it a tragic dignity. Instead of being numbed by the mayhem, we can take in details slowly, like bass notes in a miserere. A woman’s screaming features catch your eye – thud. A dead baby lies on the ground, its little snub-nosed face hanging upside down. Thud. Raphael’s mastery of classical proportion and geometry goes with a disconcertingly natural, effortless, human touch. His sympathies are never hidden. He is full of love. This is what keeps bringing you back to those Madonnas. Has any artist ever portrayed the relationship of mother and child with such warmth? The mother in the Tempi Madonna hugs her baby’s face to her cheek, gazing at him with limitless love. For all Raphael’s precision, it’s the emotion he cares about, which always comes through in a simple, innocent way. In The Holy Family With a Palm Tree, Joseph too gets in on the domestic love-in, kneeling by a Jesus who looks at him intently. These happy families represent Raphael’s lost childhood. He was an orphan. Born in the famous court of Urbino in the Marche region in 1483, he lost his mother and his father, a minor artist and poet, by the time he was 11. His sweet depictions of the holy family are surely lyrical memories of his own mum and dad, utopian projections. Raphael has an ease and sympathy with women that makes his saints and virgins glow. And that love is not just spiritual. Raphael was a good-looking youth, as he shows us himself in his lyrical, tender Self-Portrait lent from the Uffizi gallery. He knew he was handsome. In a later self-portrait he’s bearded but still suave as he poses next to his pupil Giulio Romano. By this time in the 1510s, Raphael was in so much demand to fresco Rome that he worked with a large team of assistants, led by Romano. But he also found time, says his 16th-century biographer Vasari, for fun. He was so engrossed in his love life that an employer had to let his girlfriend move into the villa he was painting, or he would not have got it done. Here she is. This dazzling show keeps its biggest treat for the end. Suddenly Raphael the person comes out from behind his art, to share his private life. His painting La Fornarina portrays his lover sitting in a garden, showing her breasts. It really is about intimacy: Raphael focuses more sharply on her face than body. She is half-smiling coyly as her big eyes skim shyly sideways: she seems about to burst out laughing. At least he died happy. Soon after painting this, his last work, Raphael died on the night of Good Friday, 1520, age 37. Vasari claims he was exhausted from too much sex, then killed by the doctors who bled him when what he needed was food and rest. He celebrated life with every painting he did. He showed us something we all need – a dream of beauty and harmony. Gentle Raphael. For more than a century he has been out of fashion, seen as just too perfect to move us turbulent moderns. This great show is like falling in love again.

4/6/2022,"It was Back to the Future at the White House. Starring Barack Obama as Marty McFly and Joe Biden as Doc Brown. And ignoring Donald Trump as Biff Tannen, a four-year rupture in the space-time continuum. Obama returned to the White House on Tuesday for the first time since the bleak winter morning in January 2017 when he departed it alongside Trump, who seemed intent on erasing the first Black president. Like a star pupil going back to his old school, proud and shiny with career accomplishments, the 44th US president was greeted by gushing staff probably too polite to mention his ever-greying hair. He was hosted in the Oval Office by the protege who happens to be 19 years his senior. They had lunch, just like they used to when Obama was in charge and Biden was vice-president. “We weren’t sure who was supposed to sit where,” the 46th president said later with a grin. What did they talk about? Trump? Ukraine? Biden’s bungled departure from Afghanistan? Hopefully the conversation was less awkward than their lunches in 2015 when Obama, having anointed Hillary Clinton as his successor, gently steered Biden away from running for president. “The president was not encouraging,” Biden wrote in his memoir Promise Me, Dad. Who knows whether Biden would have beaten Trump in 2016 but he did so four years later and so gained the throne after all. Now, with his approval rating flagging, it was time to call in a favour and a shot of charisma from his old boss. Obama’s signature healthcare law was not politically popular at the time and resulted in a “shellacking” by Republicans in the 2010 midterm elections. But now the Affordable Care Act is a fixture and Biden needs a political boost ahead of his own trial-by-midterms. In the East Room – they cancelled the Rose Garden due to rain – he got Obama to talk about the law and how many people it’s helped before Biden signed an executive order to strengthen it. It was also an exercise in nostalgia for that (seemingly) simple pre-Trump, pre-Brexit, pre-pandemic, pre-George Floyd murder, pre-Ukraine-war world when the definition of controversy was sometimes no more than the president wearing a tan suit. “Vice-President Biden,” Obama began at a lectern bearing the presidential seal, prompting loud laughter from the audience. Obama added, “That was a joke!”, walked over to Biden, shook hands, leaned in and patted his back. Biden applauded. Obama added: “That was all set up. My president, Joe Biden.” Not that any clarification will stop Fox News, QAnon followers and internet conspiracy theorists claiming it as proof that Obama is still running the government after all. Obama, who has since delved into TV production and memoir writing, went on: “It is good to be back in the White House. It’s been a while. I confess I heard some changes have been made by the current president since I was last here.” Acknowledging Biden’s penchant for shades and ice cream, Obama went on: “Apparently Secret Service agents have to wear aviator glasses now. The navy mess has been replaced by a Baskin Robbins. And there’s a cat running around which I guarantee you Bo and Sunny [his pet dogs] would have been very unhappy about. “But coming back – even if I have to wear a tie, which I very rarely do these days – gives me a chance to visit with some of the incredible people who serve this White House and who serve this country every single day, a lot of times out of the limelight.” He described Biden as “an extraordinary friend and partner who was by my side for eight years”, adding: “Joe Biden and I did a lot together.” The East Room erupted in clapping and whoops. Vice-President Kamala Harris, standing on stage, turned to Biden and applauded him. Obama reeled off a list, from saving the global economy to repealing the homophobic don’t ask/don’t tell law about LGBTQ members of the military, “but nothing made me prouder than providing better healthcare and protections for millions of people across this country”. Trump was never mentioned but Obama said to laughter: “It’s fair to say a lot of Republicans showed little interest in working with us to get things done. That’s fair to say.” Republicans tried in vain to repeal the Affordable Care Act again and again and again, he noted. And America has only become more divided since Obama left office. He went on a little wistfully: “I’m a private citizen now. But I still take more than a passing interest in the course of our democracy.” He shook hands with and embraced Biden again, who walked to the lectern and played his part. “My name is Joe Biden and I’m Barack Obama’s vice-president,” he said to laughter. “Welcome back to the White House, man. It feels like the good old days.” Yet early in his presidency, it seemed that Biden’s ambitions would outstrip Obama’s. He plotted a sweeping social, economic and climate agenda that made critics suggest Obama thought too small. Much of it has foundered, however, as political gravity brought Biden back to earth. On Tuesday it turned out he needs some of the Obama magic after all. After signing the executive order on a tiny table, 46 turned and handed the pen to 44.

Atlético did not register a shot of any kind at the Etihad Stadium but, while a repeat would secure City a place in the last four for a second consecutive season, Guardiola will go to Madrid looking to add to Kevin De Bruyne’s winner. He rued his side’s inability to extend their advantage and is determined to make them more potent next Wednesday in the quarter-final second leg. “We will go there to score and try and win again,” Guardiola said. “We played an incredible top side who are difficult to face but it is a good result. Unfortunately at the end we had one or two more chances with Kevin to score more goals [and did not]. We can attack a bit better. We go there not to defend the result but to try and win the game.” De Bruyne marked his 50th Champions League appearance with the winner, after a defence-splitting pass from Phil Foden, 80 seconds after Guardiola brought him on in a triple substitution. The City manager praised both and believes De Bruyne has rediscovered his finest form. “He is in the best moment of the season right now,” he said. “He is sharp, quick and positive. His influence in our game is massive. He made an exceptional goal with the combination with Phil. We need the talent like Phil has shown in small spaces. He has a special quality.” Atlético had three players booked for fouls on the substitute Jack Grealish and Guardiola went on to the pitch to intervene after Ángel Correa kicked the ball at the £100m man when he lay on the turf. He argued that City cannot react in the second leg as he called upon the officials to protect them, adding: “We have to control our emotions and do what we have to do. There will be a referee there. Atlético face these kind of knockout stages many times more than us and it will be a good test for our maturity.” Simeone, the Atlético manager, said: “It is a bad result because we lost 1-0 and we were looking to win.

4/6/2022,"A New South Wales police officer touched the exposed nipple of a 15-year-old Aboriginal boy who was sedated and restrained on an ambulance trolley while laughing with other officers and making a turkey noise, the state’s law enforcement watchdog has found. The Law Enforcement Conduct Commission (LECC) recommended in a report released on Tuesday that NSW police consider demoting the officer, who it found had engaged in serious misconduct during the February 2021 incident. But the Aboriginal Legal Service, which made the complaint to the LECC that prompted its investigation, called for the officer to be immediately dismissed and charged with assault. The identity of the boy, the officers, and the location where the incident occurred were all removed from the LECC report. The boy, referred to in the report as KIM1, had been arrested for breaching bail, flooded his police cell, and then threatened self-harm on the night of the incident. An ambulance was called to transport him from the police cells to hospital for assessment. The LECC found that when he was being restrained on an ambulance trolley he was subject to “disgusting” conduct by an officer referred to as KIM4, who touched him on the nipple and stomach and laughed at him while making a “gobble gobble” noise. “He could hear Officer KIM4 making an offensive and demeaning silly turkey gobbler noise,” the LECC found. “He could feel the officers touching him including Officer KIM4’s touch to his stomach and nipple. He could hear the officers laughing in response to Officer KIM4’s conduct. “This incident involved disgraceful conduct by Officer KIM4 and all those officers who laughed with and at him. It was conduct that paid no regard to the feelings of the child who was in their custody. No one seemed to remember that Civilian KIM1 was just that, a child.” The commission found that the boy lived in difficult circumstances, and was regularly in trouble with police. He had behaved badly on the night, and spat continuously, including at officers, who had found themselves in a difficult situation but had no justification for behaving as they did. “He is unlikely to forget the unsympathetic way in which he was treated and his relationship with the police is probably incapable of rehabilitation. “This type of conduct is not only likely to affect the attitude of the particular young person towards the police but carries the risk of damaging the relationship of the police with the local Aboriginal community damaging the hard work and effort of senior police to improve that relationship. “Whilst, to some extent, this sort of heedless jocularity arises out of the stressful circumstances of policing at the coalface, combined with on-the-job inexperience, there is an obligation on officers performing this face-to-face work to behave sensitively and responsibly, particularly when dealing with children.” The LECC summoned five officers and a paramedic to examinations as part of its investigation in February. It had previously reviewed CCTV footage of the incident. Officer KIM4 had said in a police statement that he did not believe he had touched the boy, but agreed he had after reviewing CCTV footage that was clearer than the vision he had previously been shown. He also watched slow-motion footage of the incident. His recollection had not been that he touched the boy but that he had said something to “lighten the mood”, which had caused him and other officers to laugh. When another officer was asked in their examination why they could be seen laughing in the footage, they said “Officer KIM4’s an idiot and … he’s taken the chance to be a clown. I’m not laughing at his actions per se; I’m laughing…at him.” The boy had been charged with assaulting police as a result of the incident, but as those charges had been dismissed in Parramatta children’s court last June, the LECC did not investigate those matters. It noted, however, that it was “not clear” why the boy was charged. The LECC said legal representatives for the officers involved in the incident were provided with a draft version of the report and invited to make submissions, but chose not to do so. It recommended the commissioner of police consider demoting KIM4, but not fining or dismissing him. It recommended counselling and further training for the other officers involved. The Aboriginal Legal Service said the boy wanted the officer to be charged. “This behaviour is cruel and dehumanising, and the response from these other officers demonstrates an even bigger problem in the culture of NSW police,” Karly Warner, the chief executive of the Aboriginal Legal Service NSW, said. “This man did not protect and serve.

For the curious thing about City’s winning goal was how deeply unimpressed they all seemed about it. De Bruyne’s features were contorted into a growl. Bernardo Silva bellowed defiantly into the stands. Nathan Aké, to be honest, just looked buzzing to be there. On the touchline Pep Guardiola angrily hurled a water bottle to the ground, furious at himself for feeling such relief. But then this is what playing Atlético Madrid does to you. Whatever joy you once felt about the game, about football, about life itself, they will find and destroy. If they can’t win, they resolve to strip all the satisfaction of victory from you. Small wonder Guardiola was still scowling as he left the pitch to do his post-match interviews. Yes, Atlético had lost. But it didn’t really feel as if anyone had won. The Etihad Stadium had been a restive and grouchy place for much of the evening. City fans are used to watching these matches – the endless hopeful through-balls and blocked shots and cleared crosses – through gritted teeth. They booed the Champions League anthem. They booed the Atlético players for not taking the knee. They booed the Romanian referee when he booked Gabriel Jesus late on. They barracked Atlético’s tactical fouls and amateur dramatics, their pratfalling and Olympian timewasting. At one stage Jan Oblak caught a City cross and was still clutching the ball 20 seconds later as if it were a sleeping infant. It was the ninth minute. Every City outfield player was camped deep in the Atlético half. Back at the City end Ederson was changing into comfy trousers and ordering a Deliveroo. Could Atlético really keep up this grizzled rearguard for another 80 minutes, let alone another 170? If any team could, it would be one led by Diego Simeone. Most sides quickly crack under City’s unrelenting pressure, the barrage of high-jeopardy decisions, the torrent of stress. To play for Simeone, on the other hand, is to live in perpetual stress. Training is stress. Team meetings are stress. To catch Simeone’s eye accidentally in the corridor or ask him to pass the marmalade at breakfast is stress. And so, as City raised the curtain on their theatre of pain, they discovered a willing audience already in their seats. An hour later, very little had materially changed. A consensual stalemate had broken out. The Etihad Stadium was still grumbling quietly. As the second half began, Oblak had still not had a save to make. The ball boy behind the City goal had had more touches than Antoine Griezmann. Meanwhile, back in the City half, Ederson was listening to a podcast. On the touchline Guardiola scratched his perfect gleaming expanse of scalp, returned to the bench and pondered his next move. Everything just felt a little stately, a little stuffy, a little too controlled. At every turn City were being confronted by an urban thicket of brick walls and tattooed legs and broken glass. Who better, then, to navigate this jungle than City’s very own street footballer? It was a triple substitution. Jesus for Raheem Sterling, Jack Grealish for Ilkay Gündogan and Phil Foden for Riyad Mahrez. Immediately Atlético had a different puzzle to solve. With Mahrez you know that at some stage he is going to cut in off the right and look for a gap. With Foden you do not really have a clue. And so it was that barely a minute after entering the pitch, Foden was standing in a perfect square of space bounded by four Atlético players. Foden got the ball, took a look, saw De Bruyne. He could have played the pass straight away. But something did not feel right. Too much space. So he kept the ball, knocked it from foot to foot, drawing the red shirts towards him. This is perhaps Foden’s best quality in tight games: he wants you to hunt him down, he wants you so close you can smell the Lynx on his neck. That is when he does you. At the moment Reinildo dived in, Foden slipped the ball between his legs: the third change of direction in just a couple of seconds. No defender can follow movement at that speed. Even the eye struggles. And so as De Bruyne ran clear and tucked in a low finish, a taut, draining game had its first real moment of grace. But it would not be the last. For the last 20 minutes Foden played Atlético like an accordion, as City threatened the second goal that would probably kill off the tie for good. There was an incredible shuffling run off the right wing, along the goalline, until he was almost at Oblak’s left post. With four minutes left there was another delicious sliding pass for De Bruyne, whose cross was cleared. Back in the City half, meanwhile, Ederson was knitting a cardigan. And that, until April 13 at least, was that. Naturally there are all sorts of tangential questions to come out of this game. Can City get their breath back in time for Liverpool this Sunday? Will one goal be enough in Madrid? And is it reasonable to expect the Spanish champions to play with a little more ambition in the biggest game of their season? For now, though, it is City – and the brilliant, transformative Foden – who have posed the thorniest question of all.",Sport/Football,Street-fighter Phil Foden finds the touch to undo Atlético’s dogged defence | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/05/street-fighter-phil-foden-finds-the-touch-to-undo-dogged-atletico
4/6/2022,"In the end it had to be him. There were four minutes remaining when Luis Díaz was sent dashing way, stepped past Odisseas Vlachodimos and rolled the ball into the net to secure a victory that had looked as if it might slip through Liverpool’s hands during a second half in which they had been made to suffer more than anyone expected. Running to the corner, he leapt and screamed. In the stands in front of him Benfica’s supporters did so, too, a flag pole sent flying his way. They had whistled him all game, before it in fact. Díaz stood for a moment, then pulled at his shirt and kissed the badge. He had beaten them again, this time in a Liverpool shirt. He has faced them eight times now and not lost any of them. Sent off against Benfica in the Portuguese cup final in 2020, a goalscorer against them in the Super Cup later the same year, this time he took Liverpool to victory. Not just in this match but perhaps in the tie, edging them towards the Champions League semi-final. He might not have been the outstanding player – Trent Alexander-Arnold’s sumptuous diagonal passing gave him a strong claim on that – but Díaz had been decisive. The only member of the front three to play all 90 minutes, a hint perhaps that he may not start at the weekend against Manchester City, he had scored one, made one and won the corner for the other in a 3-1 win. You need not have watched to know that; you could hear it. Rivalry played a part; so, too, did respect. Benfica’s fans have long known how good he is. More, in fact, than Liverpool’s supporters, delighted by how swiftly he has taken to a new club, a new style. His name was whistled when it was read out before the eagle swooped down pre‑game and, once it began, his every touch was greeted with a rise in pitch, a noise that, as it turned out, foreshadowed Benfica’s fall, all the way to the finish – when, at last, Jürgen Klopp could smile, a comfortable first half becoming a fraught second. The game was not even two minutes old when Díaz was first dumped on the floor, a huge roar greeting the tackle, but he was standing at the end. There were whistles again soon after, when he produced the pass from which Mohamed Salah probably should have opened the scoring, and a cheer when the ball was taken off his foot by Gilberto as he threatened to escape again soon after. From the corner, though, Ibrahima Konaté rose to head Liverpool into the lead. Díaz should have scored the second midway through the half, his attempt to lift the ball over Vlachodimos hitting the keeper’s arm, but he did then provide it soon after. When Alexander-Arnold’s gorgeous long diagonal found him inside the area, he guided the header beyond Vlachodimos and into the path of Sadio Mané to run it in. This was done early, it seemed: never mind resolving the tie in the first leg, it looked as if they might resolve it in the first half. A happy return for Klopp, back to where it had all begun. This is the city where he was on a break with his family when he got the call telling him that Liverpool wanted him to take over. “Completely in the holiday mood,” he had been trying to ignore the phone, avoiding football entirely, paying little attention to the rumours. Less attention than his sons, at least; they could not help but follow the stories while their dad was on a sabbatical. That day, though, he took the call from Marca Kosicke, his agent. On the eve of returning here for the first time since then Klopp explained that he listened, waiting for a thumbs-up from his wife, Ulla. “It felt right from the first minute,” he said. “It changed my life.” It changed Liverpool’s, too. That was 2015 and a lot has happened since, a club changed beyond recognition. A Europa League final, a Champions League final and club‑record points total did not yield a trophy but silverware did arrive; a sixth European Cup, a first league title in 30 years, the League Cup. And now this. Talk of quadruples is cheap, closure still a long way off, and Klopp was determined to dismiss the suggestion as “impossible”. Virgil van Dijk had made the point that what this team is doing should “not be taken for granted”. Perhaps that is inevitable, though. There is an authority about them that was replicated early here, attention perhaps already turning to Sunday and Manchester City. And yet, it did not work out that way. Van Dijk had been right: the relentless can make it look too easy but every win must be earned and Benfica forced Liverpool to do just that. Twelve shots in the first half became none in the opening 15 minutes of the second, by which time Benfica had racked up five. There was a goal, too, a penalty shout, and tension. Until, with three minutes to go, Díaz appeared, whistled all the way to the end.",Sport/Football,Luis Díaz comes up trumps for Liverpool against old foes Benfica | Sid Lowe,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/05/luis-diaz-comes-up-trumps-for-liverpool-against-old-foes-benfica
