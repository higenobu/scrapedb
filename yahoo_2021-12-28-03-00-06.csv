12/28/2021,"The owner of a 2013 Tesla Model S was facing a $22,000 repair bill to fix a faulty battery. He teamed up with several YouTubers to strap 66 pounds of explosives to the car and blow it up. The resulting videos have been seen a combined 5 million times. For the first 900 miles, Tuomas Katainen's modified 2013 Tesla Model S worked fine, he said. Then water leaks and error codes forced him to call a tow truck to take it in for repairs. After about a month, the shop told him the faulty battery needed to be replaced, at a cost of about $22,000. In addition to the hefty fee, the work would need to be authorized by Tesla, which was apparently not very enthusiastic about prior work that had been done on the car. Rather than shell out half the cost of a new Tesla to fix an old one, Katainen decided to do something different. He contacted some of his favorite YouTubers, including Lauri Vuohensilta of Hydraulic Press fame. After removing the lithium-ion battery, motors, and other expensive components, the crew hauled the chassis out to an old quarry on the outskirts of Jaala, a remote village about two hours from Helsinki, Finland. The demolition experts from the YouTube channel Pommijätkät (Bomb Dudes) strapped 66 pounds of high explosives to the car and surrounded the area with slow-motion cameras. As they were finishing the setup, a helicopter swooped in and dropped a mannequin with the face of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, which they strapped into the driver's seat of the doomed sedan. The crowd retreated to a blast shelter, where Katainen was given the honor of pressing the button and sending his former ride to vehicular Valhalla. In the video, a charge can be seen racing along the detonation cord, setting off a series of blasting caps that break the windshield and loosen several body panels. After a short pause, the 14 hotdog-shaped charges erupt into a blinding ball of fire, sending a massive shockwave rippling out from the car. Footage from a drone flying through the cloud of shrapnel and smoke shows a gray and black smudge where the car used to be. The videos of the explosion have a combined 5 million views. The standard warranty on a Model S covers eight years or 150,000 miles but may be voided if the battery is opened or serviced by anyone not authorized by Tesla. The warranty does not cover ""damage resulting from intentional actions,"" like blowing the car up for a YouTube video.

12/28/2021,"Richard “Dick” Marcinko, the first commanding officer of Navy SEAL Team 6, the group of highly trained warriors that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011, died on Christmas Day at the age of 81, according to his family. Kathy Ritchie, Marcinko's daughter, confirmed the retired commander and Vietnam War veteran's death to NBC News on Monday morning. She did not disclose any details of her father's death. The National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum in Fort Pierce, Florida, remembered Marcinko in a Facebook post, saying he “played a very unique part in SEAL history, leaving a legacy like no other.” Marcinko enlisted in the Navy in 1958 and eventually worked his way up to the rank of commander. In addition to developing SEAL Team 6, he also created Red Cell, another prominent counterterrorist unit within the military, according to NavySeals.com. Marcinko was a two-time Vietnam War veteran, who also served in Cambodia, and Iran, according to the museum. He was part of a Joint Chiefs of Staff task force known as the Terrorist Action Team (TAT) during the Iran hostage crisis in 1979, where Iranian protesters raided the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held Americans hostage. TAT’s work led to Operation Eagle Claw, the failed 1980 attempt to rescue the hostages, the museum wrote in its post. The 52 U.S. captives were eventually released Jan. 20, 1981. “After this tragic operation, the Navy recognized a need for a full-time dedicated counter-terrorist team and tasked Marcinko with its design and development,” the museum stated. Marcinko was selected as the first commanding officer of the new unit. Though the Navy only had two SEAL teams at the time, he named the unit “SEAL Team 6” to “fool other nations, notably the Soviet Union,” into believing the United States had more teams that they didn’t know about, according to the museum. He commanded SEAL Team 6 from August 1980 to July 1983. In addition to his military career, he wrote several books including an autobiography titled “Rogue Warrior.”",U.S./NBC News,"Richard Marcinko, first commanding officer of Navy SEAL Team 6, dies at 81",https://news.yahoo.com/richard-marcinko-first-commanding-officer-163434854.html

12/28/2021,"A 23-year-old Kennewick man is going to prison for more years than he’s been alive for sexually abusing a young girl over three years. When the girl finally got up the courage to tell Danny J. Delgado that he shouldn’t be touching her, he replied with threats to kill her parents if she did not let him, according to court documents. Then, once confronted by police, Delgado said the girl’s allegations and her parents’ claims that he had later confessed to them were all lies. A Benton County Superior Court jury believed the girl after listening to her testimony during an October trial, and convicted Delgado of four felony sex crimes. Delgado was sentenced last week to life in prison with a minimum term of 26 1/2 years. He must serve that entire term before the state Indeterminate Sentence Review Board will consider his release, basing their decision on factors include Delgado’s behavior and sex offender treatment while behind bars. Delgado did not have any felony history before he was convicted on two counts each of first-degree rape of a child and first-degree child molestation One count each of the child rape and child molestation include the aggravating circumstance allegation that it involved a pattern of sexual abuse. He will have to register as a sex offender and be on supervision for the rest of his life, and is prohibited from having any contact with minors, including the victim in this case. The victim reportedly said she felt safe after Delgado was convicted by a jury. However, Judge Jackie Shea Brown made note at sentencing of the impact Delgado’s actions had on the girl’s childhood and the ramifications his actions could have on her life as an adult, according to the prosecutor’s office. “The Benton County Prosecutor’s Office is proud of the courage this minor victim had to testify in court in front of her abuser, a judge and a jury, and hopes this sentence will continue to make her feel safe,” the office posted on Facebook. The sexual assault lasted until 2019. The girl was at a well-child exam in early 2021 when she disclosed graphic details of the earlier abuse to her doctor. The doctor then alerted Child Protective Services, which brought in police to investigate. Kennewick police Detective Kirk Nebeker interviewed the girl’s parents, who said after learning of the abuse they confronted Delgado. They ended all contact with Delgado after he confessed to the sexual abuse, but did not report it to police, court documents show. The girl’s doctor — after her disclosure nearly two years later — told police that he believed the parents were just being protective of their daughter by keeping it private, documents said. Delgado denied molesting and raping the girl, and told Nebeker that he never confessed to her parents about his actions.",U.S./Tri-City Herald,A Tri-Cities man could be in prison for life for raping a young girl.
