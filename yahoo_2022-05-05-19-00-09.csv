5/5/2022,"The Uttar Pradesh police in India have arrested the station house officer (SHO) of Pali police station on charges of sexually assaulting a teenage rape survivor.

A 13-year-old girl, who was allegedly gang raped by four men, was allegedly sexually assaulted again at the police station where she was left by her rapists.

The survivor’s mother claims that she was brought to Bhopal by the four men on April 22 and was raped over a period of three days.

The teen reached out to an NGO to narrate her ordeal. The NGO then approached the superintendent of police and registered a first information report on Tuesday.

The SHO, Tilakdhari Saroj, was arrested and placed under suspension. With other cops deputed at the station where the teenage girl was allegedly assaulted, six people have been arrested in relation to the case.

The teen was admitted to a hospital for treatment.

“The incident of gangrape with a 13-year-old girl in Lalitpur and then rape by a police officer after taking a complaint shows how the real reforms of law and order are being suppressed in the noise of ‘bulldozer,’” Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra reportedy tweeted. “If police stations are not safe for women, where will they go with their complaints?”

5/5/2022,"Russia is concentrating most of its military efforts in Ukraine on trying to capture territory in the east and south of the country, but it continues to strike cities and towns across Ukraine. And on Tuesday and Wednesday those strikes targeted electrical substations, railroad facilities, and other infrastructure in western and central Ukraine. The Russian Defense Ministry said the attacks on the rail infrastructure are meant to disrupt the delivery of Western weapons — Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu griped that the U.S. and its allies are ""stuffing Ukraine with weapons."" A senior Pentagon official said Wednesday that despite Russia's efforts, ""there's been no impact to our ability to continue flows into Ukraine. We've seen no indications that any of this Western aid has been impeded or even struck."" ""There's no indication at all that there's a Russian impediment to the flow"" of U.S. arms to Ukraine, the Pentagon official said. ""Our focus is on getting it to them. Their focus is on getting it into the fight and using it. And that's happening."" Ukraine has 81 of 90 promised U.S. howitzers, and ""we know that they are using some of those howitzers in the fight,"" the official said, ""but I think I'm just going to demur"" on the specific number. The flow of weapons into Ukraine ""continues every single day,"" and they ""are getting into Ukrainian hands,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said later Wednesday. ""We're not going to talk about the ways in which materials getting inside Ukraine,"" but ""there are lots of ways to do that"" and ""those ways change over time."" Ukraine and Russia both rely on the rail systems to transport military personnel and supplies, the Pentagon official said, but the Russian strikes on critical infrastructure out west have had ""no appreciable impact"" on Ukraine's ability to replenish its forces. Overall, Russia's ""ability to target with precision has been less than advertised throughout this entire war,"" Kirby added. ""They are not good at precision strikes."" Russia's strikes on ""non-military targets"" also show its ""willingness to target civilian infrastructure in an attempt to weaken Ukrainian resolve"" and damage its economy, Britain's Ministry of Defense said. These missile strikes on our cities ""will get proper answers,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed Wednesday night. ""Both legal and quite practical — on the battlefield.""

5/5/2022,"BERLIN (Reuters) -Chancellor Olaf Scholz urged Ukraine on Wednesday to help unblock an embarrassing diplomatic impasse, after the German president was stopped from visiting Kyiv amid disquiet over his past support of rapprochement with Russia. Ukraine's ambassador to Germany has called Scholz an ""offended liver sausage"" for refusing to visit the country before President Frank-Walter Steinmeier is welcomed there. ""It is a problem for the German government and for the German people that the president was asked not to come,"" Scholz told reporters following talks with his cabinet. ""Ukraine must also play its part,"" he said, without elaborating how. The row has put an awkward twist on relations at a time when Germany's opposition to Russia's invasion is crucial to Ukraine, given its weight in the European Union and the bloc's deliberations on sanctions against Moscow. Steinmeier had planned to visit the Ukrainian capital in April but the trip was cancelled, causing a scandal in Germany where policymakers have been scrambling to reverse a long-standing ""Wandel durch Handel"" - change through trade - approach to dealing with Russia. Steinmeier, a fellow member of Scholz's centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), was long considered a proponent of reconciliation with Moscow but he has since conceded that he made mistakes. German media had previously reported that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy refused to welcome Steinmeier in Kyiv over his years-long support for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline connecting Russia to Germany, which was cancelled days before Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. Highlighting the government's delay in sending someone to Ukraine, Germany's main opposition leader, Friedrich Merz of the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), visited the war-torn country on Tuesday. Scholz said he was in touch with his political rival regarding the trip, during which Merz toured the bombed-out town of Irpin before heading to nearby Kyiv for talks with Zelenskiy.
