2/10/2022,"The ghosts of Winter Olympics past are starting to rattle for Britain’s campaign in Beijing. After missing out on medals in the mixed curling and snowboard cross earlier in the week, there was more disappointment on Thursday as Team GB’s men proved to be way off the pace in the skeleton. Traditionally Britain have rarely won more than the odd medal at Winter Games, but in Sochi in 2014 and Pyeongchang four years ago they made a record-equalling five trips to the podium. That haul was significantly helped by the skeleton, which has provided the backbone of Team GB’s success in recent Games.  However the tech superiority over their rivals, which propelled them to golds in Vancouver, Sochi and Pyeongchang, did not appear evident at the Yanqing National Sliding Centre. Halfway through the event, which concludes on Friday lunchtime in the UK, Matt Weston and Marcus Wyatt sit 13th and 17th respectively, well over a second off the pace set by the world champion, Christopher Grotheer of Germany. Afterwards Weston was admirably honest as he admitted that he made “10 or 12 mistakes” on a track he described as really tough. “Normally if you make a mistake on a track you might lose a couple of hundredths, maybe a tenth of a second,” he added. “You make a mistake here and it’s like half a second here, half a second there, so it’s really punishing.” Meanwhile Wyatt remained upbeat despite being nearly two seconds back. “I was pretty happy with the run quality, two fairly consistent runs,” he said. “They weren’t the greatest I’ve ever done but not the worst.” Nonetheless questions are bound to be raised if no one in the skeleton, which has received over £6m in funding from UK Sport in the build up to these Beijing Games, comes close to the podium. And the signs are not encouraging in the women’s event either, with neither 2018 bronze medallist Laura Dees or Brogan Crowley having troubled the top 10 in their training runs. Elsewhere there was also frustration for Britain’s sole representative in the men’s snowboard cross, Huw Nightingale, after he went out in the first round. The 20-year-old, who will compete with Charlotte Bankes in the mixed team competition on Saturday, admitted: “It was not what I had planned, but sometimes it goes well and sometimes it goes not go so well. I was too far off the pack, they were drafting each other and I just couldn’t get behind them.” However at least Team GB men’s curlers were able to raise the spirits as Bruce Mouat led the team to a 7-5 victory over Italy in the first match of the group stage. In a high quality match, Mouat and teammates Grant Hardie, Bobby Lammie and Hammy McMillan were behind early before coming through. “It was a wee bit of a slow start and they got a good two in the first end. That kind of put us on the back foot early, but we stuck together and played a lot of really good shots,’ said Mouat. Earlier in the day GB’s women curlers missed the chance to win a tight match against Switzerland, losing 6-5 when Eve Muirhead’s attempt to draw the winning shot slid just past the button.",Sport/Sport,Team GB’s Winter Olympic struggles go on with problems for skeleton crew,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/10/team-gb-winter-olympic-struggles-go-on-with-problems-for-skeleton-crew
2/10/2022,"The constituency office of the environment secretary, George Eustice, has been bought by supporters of Insulate Britain, who have donated his rent to a legal fund for activists. Supporters of the activist group, which made headlines last year by obstructing major roads and calling on the government to retrofit all British homes to make them energy-efficient, formed a coalition of investors.  They acquired the property at 13 Commercial Street, Camborne, Cornwall, last October for £51,000. Since then their company, Cawton Ltd, has received £2,820 in rent from the House of Commons, which has been donated to help pay the legal costs of Insulate Britain defendants in court cases. Cawton Ltd is an anagram of Act Now – one of the Extinction Rebellion protest group’s three key demands. Sally Wright from St Day, in the MP’s Camborne, Redruth and Hayle constituency, said: “I invested because I am sick and tired of [the environment secretary’s] complete refusal to make any decisions which deviate from ‘business as usual’ when we are facing a devastating climate crisis that will lead to the death of millions if we don’t take immediate action. “I’m glad we are using his rent to pay the fines of the people who are risking their livelihoods, reputations and personal safety to give the rest of us hope that change is possible.” Insulate Britain said Eustice had taken many actions recently that they do not agree with, including authorising the use of a bee killing pesticide, and encouraging MPs to vote against an amendment to the environment bill that would have forced water companies to end the practice of dumping untreated sewage in our rivers and seas. The government was later forced to U-turn on this after public outrage. Eustice is unlikely to be pleased about this use of funds. He has previously spoken out against the activists, calling them “highly irresponsible”, and welcomed the powers sought by the Home Office to allow police to act pre-emptively to stop the protests happening. Since November last year, 28 Insulate Britain supporters have been charged with contempt of court for defying injunctions banning their protest blockades during a campaign of civil disobedience last autumn, according to the campaign group. Of these, 25 have been found guilty and 13 have been sent to prison, with 12 receiving suspended prison sentences. So far, they say, the courts have awarded costs of £84,000 against Insulate Britain defendants, with a further claim of £159,216 from lawyers acting for the government due to be decided next week. Another investor, Brenda Shrewsbury, 65, from Budock Water, Cornwall, said: “The rent from George’s gaff is tiny compared with the costs faced by the individuals that have been persecuted by the government for demanding action on home insulation, but I hope that this move will inspire others to do what they can. We need to come together and act now on the climate emergency. ” The group has decided to donate future rent money to local food banks and community initiatives to help people hit by the cost of living crisis and facing the choice of whether to heat or eat. A spokesperson for Eustice said: “We live in a free country and investors are free to invest in property irrespective of their political views. There is no law that requires a landlord and tenant to share the same political opinions.”",News/Environment,Climate activists buy environment secretary’s Cornwall constituency office,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/10/climate-activists-buy-environment-secretarys-cornwall-constituency-office
2/10/2022,"Astronomers have found evidence for a new planet circling Proxima Centauri, the nearest star to the sun. The alien world is only a quarter of the mass of Earth and orbits extremely close to its parent star, at one tenth of the distance between the sun and Mercury, the solar system’s innermost planet.  Researchers spotted the new planet after studying tiny wobbles in the motion of Proxima Centauri caused by the gravitational pull it exerts as it swings around the star. Observations taken with the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile suggest the planet completes a full orbit of the star every five days. The discovery shows that our closest stellar neighbour is “packed with interesting new worlds” within reach of further study and future exploration, said João Faria, a researcher at the Institute of Astrophysics and Space Sciences in Portugal and lead author on the study. Scientists believe the planet orbits about 2.4m miles (4m km) from Proxima Centauri, meaning it is closer to the star than its habitable zone where the temperature range is just right for water to run freely. Details are published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. Named Proxima d, the planet is the third – and the lightest – to be spotted around Proxima Centauri, which at four light years away is the closest star to the solar system. It joins Proxima b, a planet with a mass comparable to that of Earth, which completes an orbit every 11 days, and Proxima c, which is believed to take about five years to circle the star. The first hints of the planet came in 2020 when astronomers were observing Proxima Centauri to confirm the existence of Proxima b. The measurements revealed a weak signal in the star’s motion that had the hallmarks of being caused by a planet orbiting every five days. Further observations taken with an instrument on ESO’s telescope called Espresso confirmed astronomers’ suspicions that a planet was the cause and not changes in the star itself. “This is a very low mass planet, and is the third candidate around the star closest to us,” Faria said. “It shows that these planets, similar to the Earth, may be common in our galaxy, and just close by. And it makes us wonder about the possible conditions for habitability in these planet systems and if it’s possible for life to appear in other places in the universe.”",News/Science,Scientists discover new planet orbiting nearest star to solar system,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/10/scientists-discover-new-planet-orbiting-nearest-star-to-solar-system
2/10/2022,"Ryusuke Hamaguchi is a Japanese film-maker whose work I first encountered in 2018 with his doppelgänger romance Asako I & II and indirectly via last year’s experimental chamber-piece Domains, whose screenwriter Tomoyuki Takahashi has worked with Hamaguchi. Now he has unveiled this ingenious, playful, sparklingly acted and thoroughly entertaining portmanteau collection of three movie tales. Their themes and ideas are emerging as keynotes for this director: fate and coincidence, identity and role-play, and the mysteries of erotic pleasure and desire. There is a rather European flavour in the mix – one of its characters is a specialist in French literature – and I found myself thinking of Emmanuel Carrère and Milan Kundera. And although there is no formal connection between the stories (other than the thematic echoes) the simple act of juxtaposition creates something pleasingly cohesive.  In the first, Magic (Or Something Less Reassuring), we see a model called Meiko (Kotone Furukawa) going home in a cab after a photoshoot with her friend, an art director called Gumi (Hyunri Lee), and gossiping excitedly about the man that Gumi has started seeing. This marvellous-sounding individual really opened up about his own feelings on their date, talking about the ex who broke his heart. Something about this description makes Meiko very thoughtful, and she goes to see her own ex, a successful young businessman called Kaz (Ayumu Nakajima). In the second story, Door Wide Open, a mature student called Nao (Katsuki Mori), married with a child, is having a passionate affair with a young undergraduate, Sasaki (Shouma Kai), who has just been humiliatingly flunked by his professor Segawa (Kiyohiko Shubukawa), an award-winning scholar and novelist. Angry and vengeful, Sasaki asks Nao to try seducing this man, so that he will be disgraced. And in the third story, Once Again, Moka (Fusako Urabe) is a thirtysomething woman who goes to a dismal high-school reunion and only afterwards at the train station runs into the person that she really wanted to see: the woman who was her first love. Nana (Aoba Kawai), though apparently flustered and bewildered, is delighted to see her. But it isn’t until halfway through their halting conversation that both women make an alarming discovery. Hamaguchi shows how each situation is redeemed, or at any rate altered, by a kind of miracle. In the first, Meiko has the magic power to stop and rewind time so that she can play out a certain situation, or conversation, differently. In the second, the dignified thoughtfulness of Segawa means that Nao is deeply moved and this complicates her erotic designs on him. Throughout their conversation he asks for his office door to be kept open to prevent any suggestion of impropriety, but this is also emblematic of his own openness. And in the third, Moka and Nana use role-play to ease their painful emotional burdens. This trio of stories is elegant and amusing, with a delicacy of touch and real imaginative warmth. The narratives saunter along lightly but fundamentally seriously, asking us to consider how the paths we take in life – the wrong turnings, the right turnings – can be governed by the merest chance. It’s a really pleasurable and invigorating experience.

2/10/2022,"The head of the Unite union, Labour’s biggest donor, has threatened to completely pull funding for the party over an ongoing pay dispute involving bin lorry drivers in Coventry. About 75 refuse workers started a two-month strike over pay at the start of February, after talks with Coventry’s Labour-run city council failed to achieve a resolution.  Sharon Graham, the general secretary of Unite, said: “Let me be very clear – the remaining financial support of Labour party is now under review. Your behaviour and mistreatment of our members will not be accepted.” The dispute has become increasingly heated in recent weeks, with both sides arguing over claims regarding drivers’ pay and independent arbitrator Acas being brought in to help negotiations. The council has opened several temporary waste collection sites but was criticised by Unite for hiring agency bin lorry drivers to continue collections during walkouts, with Graham saying: “We have a so-called Labour council prepared to pay agency drivers to drive its bin lorries on more money than the union is asking for.” The council said the move was “to ensure residents suffer as little as possible”. Addressing striking workers in an online rally on Wednesday evening, Graham said: “Until this strike is settled, the remaining financial relationship with the Labour party is now under review. “There will be no Labour politician in the Midlands or party office who will get one single penny from my members, or any practical support of any kind, while this strike is going ahead. Not one penny will pass from our coffers until you sort out this mess that you have created. “No longer will my union accept being treated like dirt by those who have their hands in our wallets at election time. Act like Labour, and we will treat you like Labour.” In December, Graham said she planned to cut political donations to the party and divert the money to union campaigns. The striking workers in Coventry, who are Unite members, say they all hold an HGV licence but are paid at a rate below comparable rates of pay for HGV drivers in the region. The council has disputed Unite’s numbers and insisted it is one of the highest paying local authorities in the West Midlands. It says the strikes are costing the council £1.8m and said there might be job losses as a result. A Labour spokesperson said: “We’re not going to get into the specifics of this dispute. Keir Starmer’s Labour party will always act in the public interest. These sort of threats won’t work in Keir Starmer’s Labour party. We would have hoped that Unite would have got the message that the Labour party is under new management.” A spokesperson for Coventry city council said Unite’s claims that the council had released false information were “unfounded and untrue”. They said: “However, we are not interested in a public war of words but remain committed to talks to resolve the ongoing dispute and provide a service to the residents we serve. We urge Unite to do the same and consider our offers to end the strike. “The hourly wage for our bin drivers is between £11.50 and £14.38 depending on where drivers are on their pay grade. This makes us one of the highest paying in the West Midlands when comparing pay for bin lorry drivers. “We therefore remain disappointed Unite has refused to suspend strike action or allow exemptions to provide a service for the most vulnerable residents of our city such as those in care homes.”",News/UK news,Unite threatens to stop funding Labour over Coventry bin workers’ dispute,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/10/unite-threatens-stop-funding-labour-coventry-bin-workers-dispute

I wouldn’t say anything particularly struck me. Doing the work we do, we speak with all sorts of people. Josie He looked exactly like Phil Rosenthal, the presenter of the Netflix series Somebody Feed Phil. David I ate prawns and steak. I would have been prepared to forgo the steak if she was a vegan, but thankfully that wasn’t necessary. Josie I had venison and steak. David We were there for four and a half hours, it was amazing. We’ve both said we’d love to do it again. Josie Maybe I’m very privileged – I’ve moved through my life without much homophobia. I’ve been out all my life. And, as a woman, you don’t face as much. But it felt like such a direct attack at points. David We got on to the subject of abortion pretty quickly because of my work. The Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform exists to challenge society’s thinking about abortion. We place a heavy emphasis on video evidence about when life begins. We show life in the womb, and what actually happens to the unborn child when it’s aborted, then ask people what they think, using the Socratic method to question their assumptions. Josie You’d have to work flipping hard to change my views on this. I’m pro-choice. I’m still “your pussy, your rules”. David She’d thought of it purely in a bodily autonomy, women’s rights perspective, and hadn’t really appreciated, “What about the baby?” Josie He has two daughters, I asked what he would do if one of them got pregnant at 15 – would he really not support her choice? David I’ve thought through those things in the past, but to sit down with a stranger and honestly think them through was interesting. However, my position didn’t change. Josie He said: “She’d be robbing me of my grandchild.” Josie I thought, “I bet he doesn’t like gay people.” I could feel it. And I knew that if I didn’t ask, I would regret it. So I said: “How do you feel about the LGBT community?” He said: “As people, we have to draw the line somewhere as to what’s normal and what’s not. We have to draw a moral line.” Me being with a woman, he sees as the same as me having sex with my sister. We’re all under the same umbrella – incest, bestiality. I’m allowed to stay with my partner, but we have to stop having sex. Because God doesn’t like it. David I don’t believe that bestiality and incest are equivalent to homosexuality – I was just making the point that everyone draws a line somewhere. Josie I actually started crying at this point. I said: “I’m not crying for me, I love myself, I’m comfortable in who I am. I’m crying because of the queer youth who’ve been made to feel this way by their church.” Think of all the queer suicides that happen because people have been made to feel disgusting. David I can respect people’s choices. We’ve got a lady in our team, a vegan, and when she’s in the canteen, I don’t have milk in my coffee. But I wouldn’t agree with this idea that we’re meant to affirm everything that someone feels. Josie I said: “If you were sitting here with a trans woman, what pronouns would you use?” And he said: “I’d use the pronouns he was born with.” I said: “What difference does it make to you to address someone the way they want to be addressed?” David We could have gone on longer. It was fascinating. Josie I felt very conflicted about what actually happened. That night, I was lying in bed with my partner, telling her all these things, and, at the end of it, she said: “Why are you saying he’s a really nice person?” And I said: “Because he said it all with a smile on his face.” Additional reporting: Naomi Larsson  David and Josie ate at the Ivy Norwich Brasserie Want to meet someone from across the divide?
