2/23/2022,"Barclays is the latest UK bank to boost bonuses following a surge in annual profits linked to the release of cash originally put aside to cushion the blow of the Covid crisis. The lender confirmed it had increased its staff bonus pool by more than 17% to £1.3bn for 2021, having paid out nearly £1.1bn a year earlier even as the pandemic raged.  It came as the bank reported an annual pre-tax profit of £8.4bn, more than doubling the £3.1bn reported for the whole of 2020. The surge in profits was due to the improving economic outlook, which meant Barclays was able to release £653m from reserves originally set aside to offset a potential jump in loan defaults during the pandemic. That compares with the £4.8bn it was forced to put aside amid fears that customer debts would sour in 2020. In his first set of full year results the chief executive, CS Venkatakrishnan, said: “Barclays demonstrated a clear and sustainable path to growth over the course of 2021. “Our strategic priorities will continue to develop the diversified business model that we have established, investing in advanced technology capabilities in our consumer businesses, delivering sustainable growth across our global corporate and investment bank and reinforcing our commitment to aiding the transition to a low-carbon economy.” Venkatakrishnan took over from Jes Staley in November, when his predecessor resigned. Staley stepped down after an investigation by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, over how he described his links to the sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. The findings of the investigation have not yet been made public.",News/Business,Barclays boosts bonuses to £1.3bn after doubling annual pre-tax profits,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/23/barclays-boosts-bonuses-to-13bn-jes-staley-after-doubling-annual-pre-tax-profits
2/23/2022,"“What are the highest-profile examples of players who have failed a medical and then gone on to have long and successful careers,” wonders Crispin Leyser. Club doctors and physios, look away now. One has to be pretty confident in a diagnosis to halt a multimillion pound deal in its tracks, but a failed medical is no laughing matter. That said, there are lots of players who have overcome the odds and gone on to have stellar careers elsewhere.  Tom Aldous is first through the door. “Demba Ba failed a medical at Stuttgart in 2009 and Stoke in 2011, but still went on to have a good career at West Ham, Newcastle and Chelsea, which included some goal after someone slipped,” he emails. “Kanu underwent a medical following his transfer to Internazionale in 1996 which found a heart defect and stopped him playing until 1997. He still went on to have a great career at Arsenal and Portsmouth, in particular. Ruud van Nistelrooy failed a medical in April 2000, which delayed his move to Manchester United by a year … it’s fair to say that it all went well anyway. John Hartson failed a medical at Rangers, Charlton and Spurs in 2000; he instead moved to Celtic and scored 88 goals in 146 league games.” For a bit more context, the Rangers chairman, Sir David Murray, had flown Hartson up from Wimbledon in his private jet with his dad. Such were the crowds, “it was like Michael Jackson was arriving”, remembers the former striker. Murray did not hold back after the results of the medical. “His levels of fitness, our doctor told us, was a risk,” said Murray. “We did not feel that he had the correct fitness at the time to go straight into the Champions League. No disrespect, but to score against Huddersfield is slightly different to scoring against Galatasaray.” Celtic’s manager, Martin O’Neill, had a different view: “Look John, unless you’ve got a hole in your heart, I’m gonna sign you,” he said in a phone call in 2001. More Rangers cautiousness, from Jordi Gómez. “In 2000, all was set for Rangers to sign a very young Raúl Tamudo, but the medical found a knee problem with an injury that he had got during the Olympic Games,” writes Jordi. “Tamudo would go on to become Espanyol’s captain, arguably their most important player ever, and even the doctor that blocked the signing got an Espanyol supporters’ club named after him.” Garry Brogden takes us back to the 1970s for the next entry: “In November 1971 Leeds were about to buy Asa Hartford for what I think was a club-record fee from West Brom, only for it to fall through when Hartford was discovered to have a minor heart condition. I distinctly remember a picture of Hartford in the crowd at the West Brom game in the Sunday papers after the deal collapsed and speculation followed as to whether he’d ever play again. He played another 500-plus club games in the 20 years after that, including a League Cup win while at Norwich, and played 50 times for Scotland.” Fred Sullivan nominates Frank Worthington, who was also 24 when a Liverpool medical picked up his high blood pressure in 1972. Famously, he was sent on a sunshine break to Mallorca but ignored orders to relax, returned with blood pressure unimproved and the transfer from Huddersfield fell through. Worthington went on to become a Leicester City legend instead, and represented England, before playing for dozens of other teams in a playing career that ended only in 1992 – 20 years after that failed medical. To more recent years on Merseyside, and a combination of a dodgy knee and confusing negotiations led Liverpool to pull out of the £53m deal to sign Nabil Fekir from Lyon in 2018. Fekir’s agent, Jean-Pierre Bernes, said the medical was “negative”, Fekir blamed Bernes, who hit back by claiming that Fekir’s brother-in-law had worsened relations with Liverpool by demanding a fee at the last minute. The deal was called off, but Fekir would win the World Cup with France a month later, and join Real Betis a year later for £17m, where he is now one of the most creative midfielders in La Liga. Continuing our thread of remarkable late shows to come from behind and win – which we followed up on last week – Jim Clark has a real doozy … “Sorry I’m late to the party,” he begins. “On 25 August 2018, there were 87 minutes on the clock and home side Airdrie led Raith 3-1. Rovers had been down to 10 men since the 72nd minute after centre-back Iain Davidson was shown a deserved straight red for violent conduct. The small band of away fans were getting ready to vent their collective spleen at the team and manager Barry Smith for a dismal performance and result. “Goals on 87, 90 and 90+4 minutes brought the most unlikely turnaround imaginable. The final 10 minutes, complete with wild commentary from Rovers fans for our club TV channel are on YouTube. Despite all this, Smith was in charge for just one more game – a 4-0 home win over Forfar which took us to second place in League One. He resigned the following Monday citing a breakdown in the relationship with the board.” “Have a husband and wife ever been sent off in the same match?” wonders Steve Turner in September 2010. Indeed they have. Back in December 1999 Bristol Rovers were taking on Oxford United in the South-west Women’s Combination league. Midway through the match an Oxford player appeared to handle the ball, but the referee was unmoved. A livid Mandy Gornicki-Bond furiously protested, and was promptly shown a red card, despite her insistence that her remarks had not been directed at the official. The decision infuriated the Rovers manager, who just happened to be Mandy’s husband Bill. Angered by the perceived injustice he strode on to the pitch to confront the official. Bill, a policeman and class one referee, later insisted that he had not been abusive, but he too was sent to the stands. I feel it necessary to ask the kind folks at @TheKnowledge_GU if a perfect (left-foot, right-foot, header) natural (first three goals in a row) hat-trick of own goals has ever been done before this. https://t.co/f6jDK1KGKC “On 8 January this year, Barrow’s Ollie Banks scored away at Barnsley. His goal came exactly 41 years, 11 months and 27 days after his father Ian scored his first goal for Barnsley, at home to Torquay on 12 January 1980. Is this the longest time between a father and son scoring at the same ground?” muses Jonathan Wray. Brockenhurst United have a cattle grid on the entrance to their stadium are they the only ones? “Bristol City’s 2-1 win over Middlesbrough on 19 February 2022 was their 12th consecutive league game in which they have both scored and conceded. What’s the longest such streak any team has managed?” wonders Simon Orriss. Plus … What is the longest run a team has had with both teams scoring and over 2.5 goals? Bristol City are currently on a run of 12 league games “After Billy Sharp took the Championship record, who actually stands as the all-time English second-flight top scorer?” asks Mark Stephenson. @TheKnowledge_GU England's Nation's League game with Hungary will be at Molineux.

2/23/2022,"And with that, Boris Johnson ended all remaining pandemic measures in England. Those who test positive for Covid will no longer have to isolate by law from this Thursday – and from April will not even be advised to stay at home if infected. The £500 self-isolation payment for some people on lower incomes will end. Meanwhile, free testing for the vast majority of the public will end from 1 April, apart from some symptomatic clinically vulnerable and very elderly people. It will soon be entirely legal to test positive – if you’ve even got that far – for coronavirus and then wander into a packed pub. This was less a plan to “live with coronavirus”, and more to simply ignore it. Ministers offered no epidemiological evidence for pulling Covid protections this winter, with experts warning it could cause a rapid rise in the virus.  It would not be overly cynical to suggest that Johnson, wounded by “partygate”, is attempting to win the support of his libertarian backbenchers. Rishi Sunak is said to have added to the pressure on fiscal grounds, pushing to slash the Covid budget by as much as 90%. This is public health policy founded in politics, not science. The lessons the pandemic taught us – that preventive action and strong public messaging not only save lives but reduce the need for harsher restrictions further down the line – are, not for the first time, being wilfully ignored. The front pages on Monday lauding the Queen for “powering through” Covid in many ways sum up England’s new stance on the virus: a public health crisis can be tackled with personal responsibility mixed with the good old blitz spirit. It is the millions of clinically vulnerable people who will be the collateral damage. A few days after all England’s coronavirus measures end it will be two years since the shielding programme to protect those at high risk of hospitalisation or death began. It is a bleak anniversary gift from ministers. Many high-risk people, some of whom are not protected by the vaccine owing to their immune systems, feel they must now return to shutting themselves away at home – and with none of the financial or practical support available in 2020. One woman in her 60s, whose husband has asthma and diabetes, told me she already barely leaves the house, and the removal of Covid measures will see the couple’s life become worse. “It means I will never be able to even walk down the street without being terrified.” As another woman with a blood disorder, asthma and ME put it: “It’s confined me to never seeing anyone or going anywhere again.” To live with coronavirus – to really live with it – requires action from the government, including targeted help for clinically vulnerable people, such as access to antiviral treatments and employment protection; better ventilation in schools and offices; mask mandates during surges; and taking seriously the threat of long Covid. No matter what the government says, this also requires free and regular testing while infection rates are still high. Throughout the pandemic, lateral flow tests and PCRs have played a central part in monitoring outbreaks and reducing transmission: an imperfect but precious reassurance for high-risk people that enabled them to see a friend or simply let an electrician into the house. Simultaneously ending free tests along with the requirement to isolate will naturally discourage people from checking if that new cough is Covid, with research suggesting it might even give some the message it is acceptable to socialise despite having symptoms. Many others will want to take a test but won’t be able to afford to; it’s estimated taking regular lateral flow tests will now cost more than £500 a year. Recent years have seen the obscene choice of “eating v heating” for families in poverty. At a time of food and energy bills rising, ending free lateral flow tests will surely unleash “eating v meeting” – low-income people having to choose between buying food or getting tested to be able to see their nan. Cabinet disagreements mean limited eligibility for free tests has not yet been decided but it’s thought it will be restricted to a “small number of at-risk groups” – possibly the over-80s – and care home staff. It’s vital younger clinically vulnerable people are not abandoned in an aged-based approach; lifestyle habits mean a 30-year-old teacher with a lung transplant may actually be at higher risk than a pensioner. Similarly, there is concern many pre-existing conditions will be missed out; ministers refer to a “small number” of at-risk people getting free lateral flow tests, but the shielding programme alone contained 3.7 million people in England. Besides, such selection misses the point of mass testing: clinically vulnerable people aren’t protected because they can easily check if they have coronavirus, but because everyone around them can too. “Living with Covid” also requires tackling the fact many sick workers can’t afford to isolate. A new report by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) warns that low sick pay rates and limited eligibility criteria will make it hard for many to take time off work with symptoms. The UK’s statutory sick pay is one of the lowest in Europe, while the study warns many marginalised people – including ethnic minorities and people on low incomes – are not even able to access basic levels of sick pay. Without the back-up of a legal right to isolate, decent sick pay or isolation payments, workers are even more vulnerable to pressure applied by unscrupulous bosses to turn up to work even if they have Covid. Away from the worst of social media and the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers, most people are actually kind and reasonable and have willingly made sacrifices – often significant ones – over the past two years for the collective safety of their neighbours. Many will continue to, despite the new announcement. But a pandemic cannot be tackled by individual will alone. It requires leadership, something Johnson is all too lacking in. We all wish to see a time when no Covid measures are needed. But pretending we can magically return to a pre-pandemic normal in the next few weeks will not make it so – it will simply lead to a “new normal” with more anxiety, illness and, tragically, death. Johnson had a choice: roll out a programme of smart, non-invasive public health measures or allow the virus to spread unmonitored and uncontrolled. Shamefully, the prime minister is more interested in saving his own skin than people’s lives.

2/23/2022,"Independent challenger Zoe Daniel claims her campaign has been cleared by Bayside city council of prematurely erecting political signs but federal Liberal MP Tim Wilson still believes she has jumped the gun. The council issued a statement on Wednesday stating that although the federal election had not yet to be been called “we are within the [three-month] period in which an election must be held” so it would allow the signs.  The statement was later taken down following a complaint from the Wilson campaign that the council had incorrectly calculated the timing of the election. The battle between the sitting Liberal MP and the independent challenger in the Melbourne seat of Goldstein is increasingly bitter. Wilson had accused the Daniel campaign of “ignoring the council” by erecting campaign material in breach of bylaws. “It is unlawful to erect signs until after the election has been called,” Wilson wrote to his Goldstein constituents. “They don’t care if they break the law,” he said, inviting voters to dob in the allegedly unlawful signs. Daniel is one of a crop of independent candidates backed by fundraising vehicle Climate 200 running for parliament on a platform of integrity, greater action on climate change and better treatment of women. Although Wilson holds the blue-ribbon seat of Goldstein on an 8% margin it is threatened by the independent challenge. On Wednesday, the council issued a statement clarifying that candidate promotion signs must not be displayed longer than three months under Victorian planning provisions. The council claimed that 21 February marked the start of the three-month period within which the election must be held – suggesting signs erected after that date did not require a permit unless they were larger than 5 sq metres or on council land. “Council has received complaints in relation to candidate signs installed prior to 21 February however no fines have been issued,” they said. Daniel claimed victory in the sign fight, declaring the council had “confirmed that our campaign signs are legal and do not require a permit”. Guardian Australia understands Wilson has appealed against the decision, on the basis of parliamentary library advice that 3 September is the deadline for the House of Representatives election, not 21 May which is the deadline for a combined lower house and Senate election. The statement was no longer available online and the council was contacted for comment. Wilson has also taken aim in recent days at Daniel’s voting record, arguing her vote for Labor in 2019 amounted to a vote “to introduce a retiree tax”. Daniel responded that she did not support any change to franking credits or to negative gearing. “To suggest that I do is a lie,” she said in a statement. Daniel confirmed she voted for Wilson “as a vote for Malcolm Turnbull in 2016” and voted “against him and Scott Morrison in 2019”. “I am a classic swinging voter, she said. “The unsatisfactory nature of these choices was one of the key reasons I accepted an invitation from Voices for Goldstein to run as an independent. “The Liberal party exhorting people to dob in members of the Goldstein community who are displaying my signs amounts to bullying and intimidation.” After encouraging constituents to dob in allegedly unlawful signs, Wilson said: “I feel sorry for those households about to be fined nearly $1,000 each … because their candidate is knowingly encouraging them to break the law.”",News/Australia news,Campaign sign stoush: Liberal MP asks constituents to dob in people displaying Zoe Daniel material,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/23/campaign-sign-stoush-liberal-mp-asks-constituents-to-dob-in-people-displaying-zoe-daniel-material
2/23/2022,"The Australian government will implement a raft of sanctions against Russia, insisting there “must be consequences” for Moscow’s recent military actions along its border with Ukraine, and recognition of separatist-controlled regions in the east of the country. Prime minister Scott Morrison unveiled the “first tranche” of sanctions on Wednesday, bringing Australia in line with the US, UK and European allies’ initial responses to Russian president Vladimir Putin’s actions in relation to Ukraine.  Western powers have responded with outrage to Putin’s moves to recognise as independent the republics of Donetsk and Luhansk and send so-called “peacekeeping” troops into Ukrainian territory to secure the new statelets’ proclaimed borders. Australia’s sanctions would target specific Russian individuals, corporations and industries in the hope of pressuring the Russian government to stop “behaving like thugs and bullies”, Morrison said. Here’s what we know about Australia’s new sanctions on Russia, what they’re designed to do, and what their impact might be. Eight members of the Russian Federation’s security council will be targeted with financial sanctions. Australian law will now prohibit dealing with these individuals financially, as well as facilitating another person to deal with these individuals or assets they own or control. In effect this freezes their assets in Australia – which can include property as well as financial holdings. Travel bans will also be placed on the eight individuals, barring them from entering Australia. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Several Russian financial institutions will also be barred from transacting with Australian banks. The banks are the Russian State Development Bank, VEB, the military bank Promsvyazbank, Rossiya, IS Bank, the General Bank and the Black Sea Bank. Morrison announced Australia would extend sanctions that it already had in place for Crimea and Sevasatopol – Ukrainian territory which Russia annexed in 2014 – to include the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk regions now recognised as independent by Russia. The expansion of those sanctions would focus on sectors including transport, energy, telecommunications, oil, gas and mineral reserves, Morrison said. After Russia announced it would recognise the breakaway regions as independent states and send in “peacekeeping” troops, the US, UK and EU said they would introduce sanctions. The US president, Joe Biden, announced sanctions that target VEB (Russia’s state development bank) and the Russian military bank, as well as the country’s sovereign debt and five Russian elites and their families, saying: “Who in the Lord’s name does Putin think gives him the right to declare new so-called countries on territory that belonged to his neighbours?” The EU and the UK also announced sanctions in a show of concerted western resolve, with EU foreign ministers banning Russian bond trades in the European market, and the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, unveiling a package of asset freezes on five Russian banks and three individuals. Germany also announced it would halt the approval process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia. Morrison said Australia’s sanctions “ensure that we are in lockstep with the United States and the United Kingdom in the sanctions that they are imposing”. Both Morrison and foreign powers, including Biden, have warned of a ramp up in sanctions if the situation in Ukraine deteriorates. The first tranche of sanctions were designed to target “persons and entities of what is termed strategic and economic significance to Russia”, according to Morrison. In relation to the eight members of Russia’s security council, Morrison said these individuals were being targeted because the body had “provided policy advice and justification” to Putin which led to him recognising the breakaway republics – a decision which “fundamentally undermines Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and it has no validity under international law”. Dr William A Stoltz, from the Australian National University’s national security college, said the sanctions “clearly focused on pressuring those people who are part of Putin’s inner circle”. “These would be the people that we would want to prevail upon Vladimir Putin to take a different course of action … the people who are powerful enough to put pressure on Putin to retreat, so it makes sense to put the screws on them personally.” Stoltz said Australia’s sanctions alone were unlikely to significantly sway Russia’s behaviours – noting the relatively small trade volumes between the two countries. “Our economic exchange with Russia is pretty small, so we don’t have a great deal of leverage over Russia in that regard.” However, he said Australia bringing in similar sanctions to those introduced by the US and European nations was important. “For sanctions to have an effect you need to create a situation where there isn’t a safe haven country for those designated by the sanctions to turn to. So Australia has to be in lockstep with the European and North American countries.” Stoltz is pessimistic that the initial wave of sanctions will have a significant impact. He notes Australia implemented sanctions against Russia in response to the MH17 passenger flight that was shot down while flying over eastern Ukraine in 2014. “We implemented concerted sanctions over MH17, and to put it brutally honestly, they’ve not been very effective. The Russians still haven’t come to the table for the investigation, they’ve really prevented justice for the families of the victims,” Stoltz said. A large part of the ineffectiveness of sanctions against Russia, Stoltz said, had been the country’s economic resilience to foreign financial punishments. “Over the past 20 years Russia has hardened itself to the impact of sanctions, and the Russians are quite used to sanctions by now, they almost wear sanctions like a badge of honour, especially in a situation such as now where they’re kind of martyring themselves in the national interest,” Stoltz said. Oligarchs had previously been the target of foreign sanctions – with their lives in foreign countries upended and assets frozen – in an attempt to pressure them to use their influence over the country’s leadership.

Rules have been continuously tightened, and there’s a sense in Russia that it is hurting that class as they’re not able to live the luxurious life they’re used to. “So far that hasn’t affected Putin, who has put in place protections for the oligarchs to get around sanctions … and technologies like crypto [currency] make it difficult to police the sanctions. But that could stop if he goes too far and sanctions further impact the oligarchic class. He is getting older and he doesn’t have an anointed successor.” While western sanctions were designed “to influence wealthy elites by stopping them from buying homes and going Christmas shopping overseas”, Stoltz said sanctions could go much further. “There is probably going to have to be an attempt to target everyday Russian people, the general population, perhaps by constraining their access to certain everyday goods. That’s an ethically challenging thing to do. “Short of doing that, economic sanctions against Russia, especially by Australia, are largely symbolic at this point.”",News/Australia news,Australian sanctions on Russia: who do they target and will they have an impact?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/23/australian-sanctions-on-russia-who-do-they-target-and-will-they-have-an-impact
2/23/2022,"The last time I visited my ancestral home, in a typical Bengali village, no roads led there; we made our way on foot, crossing bamboo bridges at night, our path lit by fireflies. The village had no electricity, no running water. Twenty years later, I am there again, having recently arrived via a motorway whizzing through the village, or what’s left of it. Now with electricity and plumbing, my neighbours have mastered the smartphone and the WC simultaneously: two centuries traversed in two decades. The Indian writer Pankaj Mishra is fascinated by these transformations, first observing them in travelogues written in south Asian backwaters, then analysing their philosophical underpinnings and psychological reverberations in book-length essays. He has also tackled the subject polemically, especially in the Modi era, with opinion pieces in almost every major newspaper, including this one.  The changing forms of his writing, always straining to encompass the chaotic reality Mishra sees around himself, reveal him to be a profoundly literary voice, as interested in how to write about a subject as the subject itself. Run and Hide is his first novel since an unjustly forgotten debut more than 20 years ago. It offers a new way to envision what is by now, for him, familiar material. The characters in Run and Hide are the masterminds of the “New India”, who have risen from dusty hinterlands to Wall Street boardrooms and London penthouses, although Arun, our narrator, has dropped out of the rat race to translate Hindi fiction. He and his friends Aseem, a social-climbing literary celebrity, and Virendra, a hedge-fund billionaire, first met during their freshers’ hazing at IIT Delhi (one of India’s hothouse technical colleges whose alumni include Google’s CEO). The intersecting, transnational careers and personal lives of the three men ultimately involve a woman too, Alia, the Ivy League-educated scion of old-money Muslims, now writing an exposé of global elites. The novel poses as a letter from Arun to Alia, an account of fleeing their glitzy romance in London to return home to the Himalayas, from where Arun is writing in a state of moral clarity. This epistolary form (in which we never get Alia’s side) is a curious choice. The philosophising tone is reminiscent of 19th-century Russian discourse, in which the letters of the sceptic Peter Chaadaev – often referenced in Mishra’s nonfiction – critiqued his country’s modernisation. “It had become impossible for educated people like us to rest in a worldview,” Arun reflects; unlike his ancestors’ values, “unchanged from generation to generation”. Chaadaev made a similar observation, widely quoted in Russia at the time: “Our memories are no older than yesterday … and the past is lost to us for ever.” The novel manages to be somewhat plotless, yet unnecessarily convoluted. There are, at points, three levels of narrative: Arun’s letter to Alia, Alia’s own book, and Aseem’s novel. The latter two exist inside the first, an occasionally disorienting framework hardly helped by Mishra’s vacillation between first, second and third person. But Mishra is having fun with the newfound freedom of fiction, and the reader comes to share in it. Satirical snippets from post-Brexit soirees or from activist Instagram accounts are part of this; so is the vivid use of Hindi invective. Those vernacular fragments do hint, more seriously, at the linguistic wounds of success in India. Fluency in the lingua franca of global capitalism is slavishly acquired as a matter of necessity (the colonial government of Thomas Macaulay could only dream of such institutionalised deracination). In a brilliant irony, the word Aseem struggles with most is “career” (pronounced “carrier”). After the density of his recent books, with their weighty bibliographies, Mishra’s fictional prose is permitted, once again, to take lyrical flight. Here he is soulfully recollecting, in Arun’s childhood, “many moments that detach themselves from the noise of time to whisper of enchanting and irretrievable things: like the one rocket we buy at Diwali that flares into life with a gratifying hissss and then soars up and up, and then, when green and red sparks tumble down, all our smiling upward faces briefly glow”. There is such feeling behind that lovely, lilting image. Mishra, after all, embodies his own subject; writing about India’s development from an inward-looking, custom-bound society to a neoliberal global player is what instigated his own elevation from the deprived, semi-rural landscape of his birth to a London postcode nestled among the liberal elite. The mirroring of autobiography and subject recalls VS Naipaul, the Nobel prize-winning author whose enigmatic arrival in London from a tropical island allowed him to understand the postcolonial craving for modernity. Indeed, Naipaul, constantly cited and recited and even making a cameo in the book, casts an unshakeable shadow over it; wherever Mishra treads, Naipaul’s spectre looms steps ahead. Naipaul was the prophet who caught the mood of India’s ascendancy before it existed – its self-serving, self-made men – in A Bend in the River: “The world is what it is; men who are nothing, who allow themselves to become nothing, have no place in it.” The whole sublime line is quoted on the first page of Run and Hide, as Aseem’s credo. Arun, however, resists such “visions of aestheticised amorality”. Where Aseem is always repeating, after Naipaul, that “to be modern is to trample on the past”, Arun repudiates metropolitan mod cons for a monastery in the Himalayas, doubting the point of modernity if trampling on the past means deforestation and mosque demolition (which Naipaul justified). Naipaul was once a hero to every young man from the boondocks seeking to leave his mark on the world. Mishra – no different – championed Naipaul’s work in admiring reviews and edited two collections of his essays, an association that links him to Aseem in the novel. But Aseem’s Naipaulian drive leads to moral disgrace. Of the two alter egos Mishra has here, it’s Arun who remains uncompromised; Arun who shows true self-possession. With this disavowal of his onetime hero, Mishra has dispelled a troublesome shadow with one last act of homage: he has overridden the past, just like the motorway whizzing through my village.
