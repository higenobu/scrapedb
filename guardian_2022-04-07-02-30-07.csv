4/7/2022,"Major UK housebuilders have so far promised to spend about £1.3bn to remove cladding and other fire hazards from mid-rise housing blocks, but are still short of the estimated £4bn needed to avoid another Grenfell Tower-style disaster. On Wednesday Barratt Developments and Redrow were the latest to reveal how much they would put aside to address life-threatening fire safety issues in the housing developments constructed by the firms over the past 30 years. Barratt said the decision would cost it up to £400m, while the figure for Redrow is £200m. The sums add to the cash already put aside by stock market-listed rivals including Bellway, which has so far pledged £186.5m, and Taylor Wimpey, which has promised to spend about £245m, amid growing government pressure. Barratt said its decision to sign an industry pledge to address the issue reflected four years of talks with government, following the Grenfell Tower fire in London in June 2017 that claimed 72 lives and was blamed in part on developers’ use of combustible cladding. Housebuilders have stressed that they followed building rules set by the government at the time. “Through constructive engagement between industry and government, a proportionate and sensible approach has been found and we look forward to completing the remediation process as quickly as possible,” Barratt said. Persimmon confirmed earlier this week that it expected to spend about £75m to address the issue, while Crest Nicholson said remediation would cost the firm between £80m and £120m. Berkeley Group said it was committed to dealing with the issue, but did not disclose its own estimates. The collective provisions from the UK’s largest housing builders are still short of the £4bn that the government has estimated is needed to remedy the fire risks across mid-rise buildings – between 11 and 18 metres high – in England, Scotland and Wales. The commitments to date come amid pressure from the housing secretary, Michael Gove, who has pushed 53 UK developers to sign a pledge to cover the costs of remediation, and protect leaseholders from footing the bill. However, some private developers are understood to be withholding commitments, amid fears the financial burden would push them into failure. The Home Builders Federation (HBF) lobby group has said the government has not explained how it arrived at the £4bn estimate. This does include the costs of repairing housing blocks put up by foreign companies and firms that have gone bust, but it is not clear who will be required to cover these costs, or who will be responsible for fixing developments more than 30 years old. The cost of removing hazards like cladding from buildings higher than 18 metres is set to be funded in part by a 4% levy on housebuilder profits derived from UK housing developments. The federation said the money pledged so far demonstrated “the commitment of UK housebuilders to step up and meet the ‘polluter pays’ demand by government and to our long-stated principle that leaseholders should not foot the bill”. It said that other companies across industry, including contractors and manufacturers of insulation and cladding, should also be asked to cover the costs of any buildings not addressed by pledges to date. “It is our strong assertion that other parties … are asked to make contributions before the government makes further demands on UK housebuilders to fix buildings with which we had absolutely no involvement. If ministers are genuinely interested in the ‘polluter pays’ principle then that seems fair,” the federation said.",News/Business,Housebuilders pledge £1.3bn for mid-rise block fire safety remediation,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/06/housebuilders-pledge-13bn-for-mid-rise-block-fire-safety-remediation
4/7/2022,"David and Jasmine Pringle had woken up at 4am to travel to Manchester airport from County Durham after Qatar Airways told them to expect huge delays for their flight to Doha. “Leaving the house at 5am for a 3pm flight isn’t ideal,” David said. “But it’s been over two years since we last saw Jasmine’s family in the Philippines and we’ve been desperate to make the journey to see her elderly parents. We’ve paid the best part of £3k for the flights. Now we just want to get there.” “While we’re waiting to hear news of our flight, it’s worrying to see how few people are wearing masks or maintaining a social distance,” he added. “The travel restrictions may have been lifted, but people seem to forget the disease is still very much with us.” Passengers travelling via Manchester airport are once again having to endure long wait times and uncertainty over their flights – but this time before they have even checked in. Surging passenger numbers, alongside staff sickness and lack of recruitment, have created a standstill at security in recent days. Just one day after managing director Karen Smart stepped down amid criticism of long security queues and packed terminals, the issue now facing passengers is knowing how much time to allow to get through security – and how much money they should put aside for food, transport and extra Covid tests before they can board the plane. The airport is implementing measures to get to grips with the chaos it has seen in recent weeks, but many people are now finding that, having been told by airlines to arrive hours in advance for their flight, they are enduring waits of up to eight hours in terminal buildings before they can even be checked in. Manchester is a major international transport hub, drawing passengers from across the north of England and beyond. The Guardian spoke to travellers from as far afield as Bradford, North Lincolnshire, Newcastle, Tynemouth and Cumbria – many armed with Covid test results, masks and gifts for relatives they haven’t seen since before the pandemic. Geraldine and Tony Walker were also waiting to board the flightto Doha, using it as a stop-off before travelling on to Adelaide to see family. “We’ve paid nearly £100 each for PCR tests, travelled in from Brighouse in Yorkshire, and downloaded codes from several apps on to our phones to prove our vaccine status – it’s taken quite a lot of effort and expense to get to this point, so we hope everything goes smoothly once we eventually board the plane,” Tony said. Navdeep and Manpreet Singh, a couple from Leeds, were taking their daughter to Delhi. Their wait wasless than 20 minutes once they had arrived at the airport, but Navdeep acknowledged the long wait times others had endured. “There are children here and older people,” he said. “If the airlines want us here early then they should be willing to pay for refreshments.” Those arriving at Manchester after long journeys were also keen to comment on how expensive and complex it is for those landing in the city to exit the airport. Sisters Hannah and Rachel Singer, from New York, were waiting to be collected after travelling to the UK via Dublin and Paris respectively. “It’s nothing like the US,” said Hannah. “Over there you can collect someone easily from the airport. We’re waiting for our dad now – he’ll have to navigate the car park, pay a fee, and then wait for us to find him.” The airport, along with much of the aviation industry, has struggled to recruit staff made redundant after the pandemic shut down airports and travel. As the Easter getaway increases travel, similar problems have hit other airports including Heathrow and Birmingham. More than 1,000 UK flights have been axed in recent days due to crews being off sick amid a rise in Covid cases. A Manchester airport spokesperson said: “As we work to recover from the devastating effects of the pandemic, a rapid increase in passenger numbers together with the staff shortages and recruitment challenges our industry is facing, means at certain times our operations are strained. “We are doing all we can to recruit the staff we need to meet demand at all times, so that all passengers can have this experience. However, this is taking time due to the lengthy vetting and training processes involved. That is why we have been advising travellers that there may be, at times, longer queues than normal.”",News/UK news,‘We left at 5am for a 3pm flight’: travellers facing long waits at Manchester airport ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/06/flight-travellers-facing-long-waits-manchester-airport
4/7/2022,"Extreme pressure on children and young people’s mental health services, once again highlighted by a survey of GPs on their experience of referrals to these services, is sadly not new (Swamped NHS mental health services turning away children, say GPs, 3 April). Mental health services for children and young people were already very strained going into the pandemic and the stresses have been exacerbated during the last two years, with forecasts of up to 1.5 million youngsters needing new or additional support. The reality is stark. Despite everything NHS leaders and their teams are doing, a generation is now facing longer waits for treatment. We need to act now, as we know that 50% of adult mental health problems start in childhood. Unless the government acts to urgently bring forward a comprehensive plan to respond to the growing demand for mental healthcare in England, including a significant expansion of the mental health workforce, this situation will only get worse. A key element of this recovery plan must include a sharp focus on providing early, targeted and preventive support for children and young people who have, or are at risk of having, mental health issues, as this is an area that has seen a significant increase during the Covid pandemic. A national crisis of this scale deserves sustained attention from the government in the same way we have seen with the elective care backlog.Sean DugganChief executive, NHS Confederation’s mental health network  Your article (340,000 cancer patients face late diagnosis due to NHS staff shortages, 5 April) points out that a lack of early diagnosis could be the difference between life and death. Those of us working in the palliative care sector are already seeing an increased number of people who are now dying because they faced delays in diagnosis or treatment, and sometimes both. According to our research carried out in partnership with the Association for Palliative Medicine, 86% of palliative care clinicians said that they had encountered patients presenting as terminal who had had a late diagnosis due to the NHS backlog.Dr Sarah HolmesMedical director, Marie Curie  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

4/7/2022,"Shocking research showing that women do 45 hours of unpaid care a week, far more than their male counterparts (Report, 31 March), demonstrates yet again the need for a radical rethink of the current “use it or lose it” model of parental leave. In addition to more affordable childcare and a right to flexible working, we need to look at a fixed allowance of parental leave for each parent that can be used at any time in a child’s first 12 years of life. This would better reflect the ongoing needs of families as children grow up, ameliorating some of the childcare responsibilities that have led to women being disadvantaged in the workplace. Men are unlikely to take up parental leave in the first year of a child’s life. Even where a father’s time off is paid, many still fear the impact that taking time off will have on their career. A longer-term, more flexible approach to parental leave would allow parents to take shorter periods off to take care of their children, leading to a more equal sharing of responsibilities and causing less disruption to businesses than large portions of time off.Dana Denis-SmithLondon  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

4/7/2022,"Vladimir Zhirinovsky, an ultranationalist Russian politician who imitated a political opposition to Vladimir Putin for decades while playing the court jester in Russia’s parliament, has died aged 75. The cause appeared to be complications from Covid, a disease against which Zhirinovsky claimed to have been vaccinated eight times. Vyacheslav Volodin, the chairman of the State Duma, said that Zhirinovsky had died after a “difficult and long illness.” His death had already been reported and then refuted twice this year. A six-time presidential candidate and MP in Russia’s parliament since 1993, Zhirinovsky was famous for his grotesque antics and fiery speeches from the rostrum in which he appeared to reveal Russia’s darker ambitions out loud. He openly advocated dictatorship and suggested that Putin should run the country until death. “I have clean hands,” he once said of his own ambitions. “But they will be covered in blood if I become president.” Outlandish and irreverent, Zhirinovsky was laughed off by many as a clown and a chief member of Russia’s “pocket opposition” that the Kremlin managed over decades to maintain a veneer of democracy. But sometimes Zhirinovsky’s dark prophecies proved fearfully close to the truth, as when he nearly predicted the date and time of the Russian invasion of Ukraine months before it took place. “At 4am on 22 February you’ll feel [our new policy],” he said in one of his final appearances before MPs last December. “I’d like 2022 to be peaceful. But I love the truth, for 70 years I’ve said the truth. It won’t be peaceful. It will be a year when Russia once again becomes great.” On 22 February Russia recognised the independence of two territories that it controlled in southeast Ukraine. Two days later, the Kremlin launched its invasion of Ukraine, beginning a new chapter in Russian history. Zhirinovsky will hardly be needed in that chapter, when the token ultranationalist has been overtaken by dozens of Russian officials openly calling for war with the west and a return to the autarkic policies of the Soviet Union. But he was an outspoken voice of ethnic nationalism in the 1990s when, as a candidate in the country’s presidential elections, he said he “dreamed that Russian soldiers would wash their feet in the warm waters of the Indian Ocean”. Zhirinovsky, who was born in the capital of Soviet Kazakhstan in 1946, emerged on to the post-Soviet political scene in 1991 with a surprise third-place finish in presidential elections. His Liberal Democratic Party of Russia party won 23% of the vote in parliamentary elections two years later. “He was, as we now understand, the first populist of the ‘Trumpist’ type, a pioneer. But in the 1990s he seemed to be a classic far-right, close to semi-fascist views,” said Andrei Kolesnikov of the Moscow Carnegie Centre. “And in the circumstances of the political confrontations of that time, this was the case.” Over a period of three decades, Zhirinovsky created a personal cult around himself, surrounding himself with a posse of young men from the LDPR and earning a reputation as a straight-talking brawler that led to descriptions of him as “Russia’s Trump”. He gained international notoriety for flinging a glass of orange juice at opposition politician Boris Nemtsov during a television appearance in 1995 and personally provoked and took part in fistfights in the Duma. He also regularly made antisemitic and sexist comments, as when he suggested during a press conference that his aides should rape a pregnant journalist. But Zhirinovsky, who came under Putin’s sway early during his time in power, played an important role in attracting right-wing voters who may be tempted into real opposition if they didn’t have a candidate who spoke to them. Gennady Zyuganov, the longtime Communist party leader, has played a similar role on the left. “During the Putin years he performed, along with Zyuganov, the most important function: if Zyuganov ‘sterilized’ and kept the votes of left-wing voters in the legal field, Zhirinovsky did the same with the ultra-right votes,” said Kolesnikov. That was Zhirinovsky’s main legacy for the Kremlin, which viewed him as a reliable spoiler in any of the country’s elections. “His identity is so large that it is difficult to imagine the history of modern Russia’s political system without him,” said Volodin, the chairman of the State Duma and a top Putin ally. “The best assessment of his deeds is the unwavering support of voters.”",News/World news,Russian far-right politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky dies at 75,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/06/russian-far-right-politician-vladimir-zhirinovsky-dies-at-75
4/7/2022,"They may only be two words, but they are worth tens of millions of pounds. The ascending one-bar phrase “Oh I” from Ed Sheeran’s Shape of You became the focus of a plagiarism row that threw into question the very art of songwriting itself. Over the course of an 11-day trial, Sheeran and his co-writers, John McDaid and Steve McCutcheon, faced accusations that they had ripped off the 2015 song Oh Why by the grime singer Sami Chokri and songwriter Ross O’Donoghue. Central to Sheeran’s defence was his argument that the segment in question was “a basic minor pentatonic pattern”, which is “entirely commonplace”. The superstar even took the stand to hum musical scales from Blackstreet’s No Diggity and Nina Simone’s classic Feeling Good to demonstrate how common the melody of Shape of You was. The argument convinced Justice Zacaroli, who ruled that Sheeran had “neither deliberately or subconsciously” ripped off Chokri’s song. But the case showed how difficult it is to differentiate between coincidence, inspiration and theft, especially when our music consumption has changed with the evolution of streaming. In an age of YouTube and Spotify, how do we know if one artist heard another artist’s song, especially if they are relatively unknown, or if they both had the same idea? “The judgment is an emphatic vindication of the creative genius of Ed, Johnny and Steve,” said Sheeran’s lawyers on Wednesday. “As they have always maintained, they created Shape of You together, without copying from anyone else.” But the debate over copyright infringement in pop continues to rage, as a surge of lawsuits against some of the world’s biggest pop stars are brought to court. The most significant, experts agree, was the 2018 lawsuit in which Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams were found guilty of copying “the feel” of Marvin Gaye’s song Got to Give It Up and ordered to pay $5m (£3.8m) to Gaye’s family and future royalties. “The kind of borrowing that was at the heart of the Blurred Lines case has generally not been found to be a copyright violation in the past,” said Dr Tim Hughes, a senior lecturer in music at the University of West London. “Blurred Lines is an example of what might be called a pastiche: a song consciously written in the style of another. Musical history is full of examples of that practice (although generally not so blatant). But the publicity and the damages awarded in that case were so extreme that it has clearly helped encourage further lawsuits.” Other recent litigations include two against Dua Lipa over her song Levitating, one against Katy Perry over her song Dark Horse, and one against Taylor Swift over her 2014 hit Shake It Off by two songwriters who claim she lifted their phrases. Sheeran himself settled a $20m plagiarism lawsuit for his song Photograph in 2017, after he was accused of copying former X Factor winner Matt Cardle’s Amazing. Olivia Rodrigo added two members of Paramore to the writing credits of her hit single Good 4 U, after fans noted similarities to Paramore’s Misery Business. She’s also been accused of copying the riff from Elvis Costello’s Pump It Up in her song Brutal. But as Costello noted when he came to her defence, this is part and parcel of the process of making music. “It’s how rock & roll works,” he said. “You take the broken pieces of another thrill and make a brand new toy. That’s what I did.” According to Joe Bennett, a forensic musicologist at Berklee College Of Music in the US, “opportunistic plaintiffs” are exploiting a common musical error that listeners can make, which is to assume that plagiarism is the only explanation for one melody being slightly similar to another. “There are 60,000 songs uploaded to Spotify every day, with more than 82m recordings in the catalogue,” Bennett said. “Right now, we’re in an era of mainstream pop where a lot of songs are based on two- and four-bar chord loops … So once in a while a short coincidental similarity occurs, and the plaintiffs are so struck by the similarity that they believe the only explanation must be plagiarism. They are often mistaken.”",Arts/Music,Coincidence or theft?

4/7/2022,"Scientists have developed a blood test that can predict whether someone is at high risk of a heart attack, stroke, heart failure, or dying from one of these conditions within the next four years, with roughly twice the accuracy of existing risk scores. The test, which is already available in the US, could enable doctors to determine whether patients’ existing medications are working, or whether they need additional drugs to reduce their risk. It could also hasten the development of new cardiovascular drugs by providing a faster means of assessing whether drug candidates are working during clinical trials. Protein analysis can provide a more accurate snapshot of what someone’s organs, tissues and cells are doing at any given moment in time. Stephen Williams at SomaLogic in Boulder, Colorado, and colleagues used machine learning to analyse 5,000 proteins in plasma samples from 22,849 people, and identify a protein signature that could predict the four-year likelihood of heart attack, stroke, heart failure or death. When validated in 11,609 of the participants, they found that their model outperformed existing risk prediction tools, which use someone’s age, sex, race, medical history, cholesterol and blood pressure to to characterise risk. “Our ability to stratify risk across populations is more than twice as good as existing risks scores,” said Williams, whose results were published in Science Translational Medicine. Importantly, the test could also accurately evaluate risk in people who have previously suffered a cardiovascular event and are taking drugs to reduce their risk, which existing risk assessments struggle to do. The tool is already being used in four health systems within the US, and SomaLogic is in talks about the possibility of introducing it to the UK.",News/Society,New blood test predicts risk of heart attack and stroke with double previous accuracy,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/06/blood-test-predict-heart-attack-stroke-double-previous-accuracy
4/7/2022,"Brendan Rodgers has said Leicester City must get to the bottom of Jamie Vardy’s knee injury after revealing his return has been hampered because the striker is still in discomfort when striking the ball. Vardy has trained this week but will miss Leicester’s Europa Conference League quarter-final first leg at home against PSV Eindhoven on Thursday. Rodgers has said Leicester cannot afford to be dismissive of the competition, which is in its inaugural season, and said winning it would be “prestigious” despite how it is viewed compared to other European tournaments. Vardy sustained a knee injury during the victory over Leeds at the beginning of March, in his second game back following a hamstring problem but Rodgers has said the 35-year-old remains in pain in his medial collateral ligament. Vardy had initially been expected to be sidelined for a month. “It’s hard to put a timeline on it,” Rodgers said. “He can still feel pain in the knee. But it’s just when he’s striking the ball there is an issue, so we have to try to get to the bottom of that. “I have just had a quick chat with Jamie, he had been outside and he’d been running in straight lines, but when he was opening up the MCL, when he was striking the ball, he had a little bit of pain in that. I’ll have to speak with the medical team to see where that is at. It doesn’t sound as if he’s too close to being back.” Of the game, Rodgers said: “We don’t have a rich history in European football so to be in the quarter-final is deemed a real occasion.” Timothy Castagne said Leicester must treat PSV, who are second in Eredivisie, with respect and insisted he and his teammates will not have any superiority complex. “We can’t underestimate anyone,” Castagne said. “I think some people think that because we are from the Premier League and they are from the Eredivisie that it’s going to be easy for us but they are a good team with good players. They are doing very well so we have to play our normal game. If we do, we will go through.” Rodgers will welcome back the full-back Luke Thomas, who was forced to withdraw from England Under-21 duty last month with a hamstring issue. Castagne suffered a double fracture in his eye socket during Belgium’s Euro 2020 opener last summer but said the injury, from which he returned in August, did not alter his mindset. “I thought it would but I wasn’t that scared to go into duels again,” he said. “Now I am just happy to be able to play.

For the first time since 2019, red-ball cricket returns to some normality, two divisions restored to their rightful place, though this time split 10 to eight.

4/7/2022,"French financial prosecutors have opened a preliminary investigation into suspected tax fraud by global management consultancy firms, just as Emmanuel Macron’s re-election campaign has been hit by a row over the government’s use of private advisers. An investigation by the French Senate recently concluded that French public spending on consultants had more than doubled between 2018 and 2021, and reached a record level of €$1bn last year. The senate, which has a majority on the right, condemned what it called the “sprawling phenomenon” of dozens of private and international firms being hired to advise the government. Senators singled out the US-based consultancy giant McKinsey, which it said did not pay corporation tax over a 10-year period despite declaring sales of €329m in France. The senate report alleged that McKinsey used a system of “tax optimisation” through its Delaware-based parent company. McKinsey responded with a statement saying it “respects French tax rules that apply to it” and defended its work in France. The firm said it had paid €422m in taxes and social charges in France. On Wednesday, France’s national financial prosecutor’s office announced that an investigation had been launched into alleged “money laundering aggravated by tax fraud”. Prosecutors did not name any specific company, but said they would investigate tax practices by management consultancy firms as a whole. The row over the role of consultancy firms has been dubbed “the McKinsey affair” and has created an unexpected image problem for Macron’s re-election campaign. It is not illegal for the government to use private consultants, and Macron is not accused of personal wrongdoing. But his political opponents have said taxpayers’ money was spent too lavishly on international consultancies. They said this reflected Macron’s background as a former investment banker, and dubbed him a “president of the rich”. The radical left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon said it was a “scandal” that the state employed private consultants and said he would put an end to such contracts. The far right’s Marine Le Pen said it was “shocking” and “insulting” for taxpayers to see so much of their money spent on consultants. Macron has responded by saying that France used consultancy firms much less than other countries and that public procurement policies had been strictly followed. He said nothing “murky” had gone on and that it was “totally false” to imply any wrongdoing. He insisted he had been leading an “international battle” in Europe to get big global firms to pay a minimum tax in the country where they earn profits, and said additional help had been required during the Covid-19 pandemic, when ministries and civil servants had been stretched thin. Macron enjoyed a boost in the polls last month as voters approved of his handling of the crisis in Ukraine, but he has recently dipped slightly ahead of the first round on 10 April. Meanwhile, far-right Le Pen has risen in the polls and is currently running second behind Macron.

4/7/2022,"The UK’s best known consumer finance journalist, Martin Lewis, was uncharacteristically downbeat about the new edition of his newsletter, which went out to 8.4 million UK subscribers on Wednesday morning, writing: “This is a guide I really wish we needn’t be publishing.” Lewis’s Money Saving Expert newsletter is normally, and famously, packed with scores of top tips and tricks to help subscribers navigate the complex world of loans, insurance and utility bills grab the best deals, from shopping to holidays. This week’s edition, however, concerns the cost of living crisis. The content of How to Heat the Human Not the Home is more self-help and survival guide than consumer in tone. The grim background to this ingenious and oddly depressing initiative is that in the UK in 2022 millions are so hard up they can’t heat their home. “I felt sad asking my team to put this together,” Lewis tweeted. “But my email bag is full of folk so desperate they can’t put the heat on, I wanted to try some help.” The guide is a practical list of options if you can’t afford to heat your home – a reality for many as the energy price cap rises and average bills shoot up to £2,000 a year, and millions of households slide into fuel poverty. Lewis admitted recently he was nearly out of conventional money-saving tools when it came to energy bills. The guide discusses in forensic detail the costs and relative effectiveness of a range of alternatives to switching off the central heating, from heated insoles (less than 1p an hour) to hot-water bottles (6p an hour, assuming you boil 1.7 litre capacity kettle twice a day). It advises on the right clothes to wear, the basic science of base, mid and outer layers, and where to buy them most cheaply, and notes the psychological importance of socks and keeping one’s feet warm. The floor is the coldest part of the house – so put your foot up on a stool when you are sitting down, it suggests. Some of the tips do require a financial outlay and don’t come cheap if you do not have savings and are on benefits, for example, £46 for a heated gilet, or £13 for a fleece outerlayer. The main source of the expertise is not, as usual, Lewis’s team of financial experts but thousands of his subscribers – clearly, many of them, experts with lived experience of living in constrained financial circumstances – who have set about advising with pluck and homespun wisdom. “The days of me throwing tights away once they have had it is over, I chop the feet off and wear them under my trousers and it is amazing what difference it makes,” says Rosa. Another reader writes: “When sitting down, sit in a sleeping bag, at least your bottom half. Even better is you put a hot-water bottle in the bottom. Warm with no draughts.” For all its sound advice, the guide acknowledges the limits of ingenuity. It may be dangerous to cut off the heating if you have certain health conditions, such as asthma, it points out. Eat regularly, it advises, though it admits a hot meal once a day may not be affordable for some. And at that point you may have to try the local food bank. Nearly 12,000 people have liked Lewis’s tweet announcing the guide (part of a wider 90 ways to survive the cost of living crisis). The replies have provoked admiration, eager willingness to contribute tips, and distress, not least over the quiet desperation so many find themselves in, in one of the world’s wealthiest countries. As one Twitter respondent put it: “It’s a damning indictment of the depths to which this country has sunk when the cheerful guy who provided advice about the best savings, offers and phone deals is now tearfully providing advice on how not to die from cold or malnutrition. Thank you, I wish it wasn’t necessary.”",News/Business,"‘Heat the human, not the home’: Martin Lewis guide for ‘desperate’ households",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/06/martin-lewiss-cost-of-living-guide-offers-advice-to-desperate-households
4/7/2022,"Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who has died aged 75 after suffering from Covid-19, was an ultra-nationalist Russian politician who used boorish language and behaviour to cultivate an image of being a licensed court jester in the Russian parliament, where he held a seat for close to 30 years. An admirer of Donald Trump, Zhirinovsky outperformed Trump with homophobic and racist invective, and sexual slurs against prominent female politicians. True to form, he shared the contempt for Ukraine and other former Soviet republics that became the hallmark of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. In 2014 soon after Ukraine’s pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, was toppled by a nationalist pro-western coup, Zhirinovsky called all Ukrainian women “nymphomaniacs” and urged two of his aides to “violently rape” a pregnant Russian journalist who had asked him a question he did not like. Two years later he threatened the former Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili, who had become governor of the Ukrainian city of Odesa. “We will shoot all of your governors, starting with Saakashvili, then they’ll be afraid. And there will be a different situation in Europe and Ukraine ... Let’s aim at Berlin, Brussels, London and Washington,” he raged. In spite of these and other similarly wild and abusive comments Zhirinovsky was tolerated as a member of parliament largely because there was no chance that he, or the Liberal Democratic party of Russia that he led, would ever take power. The origin of his party was murky. It was the first party to be registered after the Soviet constitution was changed in 1990 to abolish the monopoly of the Communist party of the Soviet Union. There was evidence that the KGB had created the party and chosen Zhirinovsky as its leader so as to split the electorate and prevent genuine reform-minded parties becoming the main opposition to the ruling communists. Zhirinovsky contested the 1991 election for the Russian presidency and won 7% of the vote. In the 1993 elections for the Russian parliament, the Duma, Zhirinovsky’s party did better. It took just under 23% of the vote, emerging as the strongest party. By then Zhirinovsky’s role had changed. The Soviet Union had imploded and Boris Yeltsin, the new Russian president, was bringing in market economy reforms. Zhirinovsky’s aim was to take votes from the communists, who were threatening to make a political comeback and defeat Yeltsin. Zhirinovsky denounced the economic reforms that Yeltsin and his ministers said were necessary shock therapy to end food subsidies and state ownership of industry, but which had led to a fall in most Russians’ living standards. He also attacked the rise of a new class of super-rich, the pro-Yeltsin oligarchs. He projected himself as a populist “third force” that could offer Russians hope where first the communists under Gorbachev and later the reformers under Yeltsin had failed. Apart from his political message Zhirinovsky’s earthy qualities appealed to many Russians. On TV he was quick and bright in contrast to Yeltsin’s slow and ponderous diction, often made more hesitant as a result of excessive vodka drinking. His rise as a political star, if not ever a serious power-holder, was surprising, especially as his father, Volf Isaakovich Eidelshtein, was a Jew from Kostopil in western Ukraine. It was rare for Jews to become politicians in the Soviet Union. His mother, Alexandra Pavlovna (nee Makarova), was of Russian background from the Mordovia region. The couple split when Vladimir was still an infant, and in 1949 his father emigrated to Israel, where he worked as an agronomist. Vladimir then took the surname of his mother’s first husband, Andrei Vasilievich Zhirinovsky, who had died just over a year before she married Eidelshtein. In 1964, Zhirinovsky became a student in the Department of Turkish Studies at Moscow State University’s institute of Asian and African studies. On graduation in 1969 he did his compulsory military service in Georgia. He later got a law degree and worked in various posts for state committees and trade unions. In 1989, he served as a director of Shalom, a Jewish cultural organisation. Why he was chosen to head the new Liberal Democratic party of Russia is obscure. He played down his Jewish origin, telling journalists with a smile: “My mother was Russian and my father was a lawyer.” He described himself as an Orthodox Christian. He took up the anti-immigrant cause, expressing concern that people from the Caucasus were displacing native Russians in Russian cities. He wanted all Chinese and Japanese people to be deported. During a TV interview on a visit to the US in 1992, he called “for the preservation of the white race” and warned that white Americans were in danger of turning their country over to black and Hispanic people. His views on foreign policy were designed to shock. He outlined them in a 1995 book, The Last Break Southward. Russia should extend its reach to the shores of the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean, he wrote. Russia would rule the space “from Kabul to Istanbul”. “This is really the solution for the salvation of the Russian nation,” he wrote. He later advocated the forcible seizure from the US of Alaska, which would then become “a great place to put the Ukrainians”. He called for ethnic Russians to break away from Estonia and Latvia and recommended the use of tactical nuclear weapons against Chechnya. For the last 25 years of his life, few people took him seriously once it was clear he would never be appointed a government minister. He is survived by his wife, Galina Lebedeva, and three children, Igor, Oleg and Anastasia.
