1/27/2022,"Even though the world has been dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic for nearly two years, we're still learning about the virus and how it can affect our bodies. One area of understanding that has been particularly difficult to grasp has been the wide range of symptoms the virus can cause and how some can stick around long after recovery. Now, a new study has found that one symptom is having a long-term effect on about half of people who have caught COVID. Read on to see which ailment could be sticking around for a while after you've beaten the disease. RELATED: This Is How Long Your Omicron Symptoms Will Last, Doctors Say. The latest research comes from a team of scientists in Sweden looking to better understand one of the most bizarre and highlighted symptoms of COVID-19 infection: Anosmia, or loss of smell. In a preprint study that has not been peer-reviewed, the researchers ran tests on 100 patients who had been infected with COVID during one of the earliest waves in Sweden in the spring of 2020. Results showed that while only four percent of those sampled ever lost their sense of smell entirely, 33 percent of them had experienced a decreased ability to sense odors, and 49 percent of patients reported parosmia, which is the medical term for a distorted sense of smell, The Guardian reports. The team also ran the same tests on a control group of participants who tested negative for COVID antibodies, finding that one in five people showed lessened senses of smell and establishing how common smell disorders can be in the general population. Ultimately, the researchers concluded that 65 percent of patients who eventually recovered from COVID-19 still suffered a complete loss, reduction, or significant change in their sense of smell 18 months after they initially caught the virus. Comparatively, only 20 percent of people who have never had COVID suffer any deficiency in their ability to smell. The researchers point out that participants involved in the study were volunteer healthcare workers who were more likely to be tested for the virus early on in the pandemic. As such, everyone was infected by the earliest version of COVID-19, predating the variants that eventually evolved and changed some aspects of how the virus behaves. It also means that no one in the group had yet been vaccinated. However, the researchers ultimately concluded that ""given the amount of time since [the] initial insult to the olfactory system, it is likely that these olfactory problems are permanent.""

While studies established partial or total loss of smell to be relatively common during the early phases of the pandemic, some research has found that the latest version of the virus may not be likely to cause the same symptom. According to a study from the U.K. Health Security Agency, anosmia or parosmia were less than half as likely to be reported when infected with the currently dominant Omicron variant compared to the previous Delta variant. However, the authors of the Swedish study cited a lack of reliable data on Omicron's ability to affect someone's sense of smell and argue there's still a possibility someone who's infected could develop the symptom during the current surges, The Guardian reports. According to Johan Lundströmm, PhD, the initial study's leader from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, long-term anosmia or parosmia can significantly affect a person's overall health more than one might expect. ""When you cannot smell, all you can sense is the five basic taste qualities, tactile sensations, and spices,"" he said. ""Unconsciously, people start to add more sugar and fat, or have an increased urge for fried food for the texture, all to get some enjoyment out of eating."" Even though the researchers say the long duration of the symptom is the most surprising finding of the study, Lundström explained that those whose sense of smell was affected can still see some improvement. ""Many of these individuals can get help by doing olfactory training,"" he told The Guardian. ""They might not regain 100 percent of past performance, but most of them will, with training, get back to a point where their reduced sense of smell will not affect their lives.""

1/27/2022,"Two teenage brothers and a third teen in Pharr, Texas have been charged with beating the brothers' stepfather to death for allegedly sexually abusing his nine-year-old daughter — their half-sister. Christian Trevino, 17, is charged with aggravated assault, capital murder and engaging in criminal activity in the Thursday death of Gabriel Quintanilla, 42. Juan Eduardo Melendez, 18, is also charged with capital murder, aggravated assault and engaging in criminal activity in Quintanilla's death. He’s also facing a possession of marijuana charge, according to Hidalgo County Jail records McAllen Monitor. Alejandro Trevino, 18, is charged with aggravated assault and engaging in organized criminal activity. (Alejandro Trevino was not charged with capital murder because he was not involved in delivering the injuries that cause the victim’s death, according to Pharr Police Deputy Chief Juan Gonzalez.) Juan Melendez, Alejandro Trevino and Christian Trevino Photo: Hidalgo County Jail Police said the brothers are the half siblings of the nine-year-old, according to the Monitor. All three teens were arraigned on Sunday. Police said that Gabriel Quintanilla, 42, was beaten at several different locations, including with brass knuckles, and suffered severe head injuries before he was left — apparently alive — in a field in McAllen. He was discovered there by a farmer on Thursday afternoon. Police say the brothers were angered after their nine-year-old half-sister told their mom about being inappropriately touched by Quintanilla, her father and the boys' stepfather, Gonzalez said a news conference on Sunday. The child also told Alejandro and Christian about the incident, police said. “When brothers Alejandro and Christian Trevino found out, they became enraged and confronted Gabriel Quintanilla at the residence. A physical fight ensued between the three and the victim, Quintanilla, left the location on foot,” according to a press release from the Pharr Police Department. Christian Trevino then chased Quintanilla on foot, catching up with him at an apartment complex and beating him again, according to police. Police said Alejandro Trevino and Juan Eduardo Melendez, driving a car, caught up with Quintanilla and Christian Trevino and joined in the second assault. The three then left Quintanilla, drove to pick up a Ford F-150, and again went looking for Quintanilla, who they found injured and walking alone. They confronted him again. “A third assault occurs, and the victim is severely beaten. The victim, who is still alive, is placed in the bed of the truck and [they] drove off,"" police said. ""[They] ended up in the McColl and Whalen Road area where the victim was dropped off in an open field and the suspects fled,” according to police.  At a press conference on Tuesday, police revealed that Quintanilla was wanted on charges of continuous sexual assault of a child and assault, family violence dating to 2019, the Monitor reported. Police said that case involved another minor child, not the Trevino's half-sister, and the abuse had been ongoing until it was reported to police three years ago. A warrant was issued for Quintanilla's arrest at the time, but he'd successfully evaded authorities' attempts to arrest him since the warrant was issued. It's unclear if the Trevino brothers knew about the other pending charges against Quintanilla. ""We understand the sentiment and the attention that this case has drawn in this homicide in our city,"" Pfarr Police Chief Andy Harvey said at the press conference. ""We definitely understand that; that’s why I think it’s important to have this conversation.""",U.S./Oxygen,Teens Charged In Man's Murder After He Allegedly Sexually Abused Their Half-Sister,https://news.yahoo.com/teens-charged-mans-murder-allegedly-212555155.html
