1/19/2022,"NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump plans to build 2,300 luxury homes at his Doral golf resort in the Miami area, part of a flurry of recent moves to revive a family business suffering from the one-two punch of a divisive presidency and coronavirus shutdowns. In a news release Monday, the 45th president called the plans for his sprawling Trump National Doral resort “perhaps the most exciting development in the country” but was short on details such as the size of the homes and what they may cost. The release said the plans called for the construction of retail and commercial space as well. The Doral, the biggest revenue generator among Trump's 17 golf properties, has been a drain on the business in recent years. In 2019, Trump announced plans to hold the global meeting of Group of Seven leaders at the resort, a potential big money maker for hosts. But he had to cancel after a bipartisan outcry over self-dealing and a possible violation of a constitutional ban on presidents receiving gifts or payments from foreign leaders. The resort had hoped to regain ground after the PGA and other organizations pulled events there, but finances have only gotten worse since. Revenue plunged more than by $33 million over the next two years, down more than 40%, according to financial statements filed with a federal government ethics office. As of last year, the Trump company had $125 million borrowed on the property. The Trump Organization did not reply to requests for comment. The press release had an official U.S. government seal with an American eagle at top, an unusual use given the release was promoting a private business venture. Former presidents can use the seal for matters involving their former office, but are not allowed to profit from it. Under federal law, the seal can only be used for official government business. The Trump Organization’s plans for Doral are part of a string of recent business moves after months of relative quiet. In September, several news outlets reported that the company had struck a preliminary deal to sell the lease underlying its Washington, D.C., hotel to Miami-based CGI Merchant Group for $375 million, much more than many hotel experts had expected for the money-losing property. In October, Trump announced a new rival to Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms that had banned him after his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 last year. The business said it is will give voice to others who've been taken off social media sites as part of “cancel culture."" Last month, it said it had raised $1 billion from unnamed investors and plans to launch the messaging app called Truth Social early this year.",Business/Associated Press,"Trump plans 2,300 new homes at struggling Doral resort",https://news.yahoo.com/trump-plans-2-300-homes-224257183.html
1/19/2022,"ATLANTA (AP) — Lawyers for a man convicted of murder for fatally shooting his wife as they rode in an SUV in Atlanta say he did not have a fair trial and are asking Georgia's highest court to overturn his conviction. Claud “Tex” McIver, 79, is serving a life sentence after being convicted of felony murder and other charges in the 2016 shooting of his wife, 64-year-old Diane McIver. There was never any dispute that McIver shot his wife — the question at trial was whether he meant to. Prosecutors said he was driven to kill her because he coveted his wife's money. Defense attorneys said that was nonsense, that McIver loved his wife dearly and her death was a terrible accident. McIver was convicted in April 2018 of charges including felony murder and aggravated assault. The Georgia Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments Wednesday on his appeal of his convictions. The McIvers were wealthy and well-connected. He was a partner at a prominent labor and employment law firm and served on the state election board. She was president of U.S. Enterprises Inc., the parent company of Corey Airport Services, where she had worked for 43 years. Dani Jo Carter, a close friend of Diane McIver, was driving the couple’s Ford Expedition the evening of Sept. 25, 2016, as the three returned from a weekend at the McIvers’ horse farm about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Atlanta. Diane McIver was in the front passenger seat and Tex McIver was in the back seat behind his wife. With traffic heavy on the interstate, Carter exited in downtown Atlanta. McIver asked his wife to get his gun from the center console and hand it to him. A short while later, McIver fired the gun once, striking his wife in the back. Carter drove to a hospital where Diane McIver died. A family friend told news outlets several days after the shooting that the McIvers had worried about unrest surrounding Black Lives Matter protests and feared a carjacking. A few days later, McIver's attorney at the time told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution there had been no concern about protesters but rather about people in the street in an area frequented by homeless people. Police in 2016 charged McIver with felony involuntary manslaughter and misdemeanor reckless conduct. But a Fulton County grand jury in 2017 indicted him on charges including murder. In their appeal, McIver's attorneys have argued that Fulton County Superior Court Chief Judge Robert McBurney made multiple mistakes during the trial, and the conviction should be reversed. McBurney was wrong when he refused to tell the jury they could find McIver guilty of misdemeanor involuntary manslaughter based on evidence at trial, McIver's lawyers argue in a brief submitted to the high court. Georgia law says that if evidence exists that a defendant committed a lesser crime, the jury should be given that option, they wrote. Misdemeanor involuntary manslaughter is when someone engages in lawful behavior in an unlawful way that unintentionally causes a death. Prosecutors argue that McBurney was correct in his instructions to the jury. There was no basis for a misdemeanor involuntary manslaughter charge because no evidence showed that McIver was acting lawfully when the gun fired and his handling of the gun amounted to reckless conduct, they wrote. Furthermore, state lawyers argue, the jury ultimately convicted McIver of aggravated assault and felony murder rather than felony involuntary manslaughter, and it's unlikely that the court's decision not to include a misdemeanor involuntary manslaughter charge affected the verdict. It was also improper for McBurney to allow the jurors during their deliberations to examine the McIvers' SUV and experiment with possible angles of the gunshot, McIver's lawyers wrote. The state has countered that jurors had already been allowed to see the SUV during the trial and no new evidence was admitted during that second viewing. When jurors sent a note indicating they were at an impasse, the judge was wrong not to tell them not to sacrifice a firmly held belief and that a hung jury was permissible when he instructed them to keep deliberating, McIver's lawyers argue. But prosecutors argue that McBurney properly exercised his discretion in giving the instruction and that McIver's lawyers have not shown that the verdict was the result of coercion. McBurney should not have allowed prosecutors to needlessly introduce speculative but baseless theories for a motive for McIver to kill his wife, as well as suggestions of racial bias, his lawyers argue. That evidence served only to prejudice the jury against McIver, they wrote. State lawyers argue that the financial evidence was necessary to show his motive and intent and the references to Black Lives Matter was one of multiple conflicting stories McIver gave about why he asked for his gun.",U.S./Associated Press,Man who shot his wife in SUV wants murder conviction tossed,https://news.yahoo.com/man-shot-wife-suv-wants-205836601.html
1/19/2022,"Criminal justice activists have accused Raleigh police of fatally shooting a young dad who was “so confused and disoriented that he didn’t even respond to his wife when she spoke to him” following a highway crash in North Carolina. Daniel Turcios, 43, was shot and killed by officers who responded to a car crash last week involving the beloved husband and father to three boys. Police said they received multiple 911 calls at about 1:30 p.m. on Jan. 11 about a car wreck indicating that a person was intoxicated. During a news conference, Raleigh Police Chief Estella Patterson said the El Salvador native was allegedly “armed with a knife” when he was walking away from the scene of the crash alongside a small child. According to Patterson, who cautioned repeatedly that details about the incident were “preliminary,” Turcios was ordered repeatedly to drop the knife. Black Missouri Man’s Killing Deemed ‘Justifiable Homicide’ Despite Outcry When Turcios failed to drop it, officers tased Turcios, causing him to stumble to the ground. As officers were preparing to take him into custody, he allegedly “swung the knife towards officers,” Patterson said. It was then that an officer fired at Turcios. But during a news conference condemning the officer who killed Turcios, Emancipate NC, a group aimed at dismantling structural racism and mass incarceration in the state, pushed back on those claims. Executive director Dawn Blagrove said that Turcios was “disoriented” when cops approached him at the crash scene. “In this case, because Daniel was disoriented from a severe blow to the head resulting in a temporary loss of consciousness that he suffered during the car accident–was that taken into consideration before the officers proceeded to engage?” The group shared footage from the scene that was clipped just a few seconds after similar footage circulated online. Kerwin Pittman, the group’s policy and program director, said it showed the officer who killed Turcios firing additional shots as Turcios lay on the ground. “In this footage it is undeniably clear that after the initial shot sustained by Daniel Turcios, he was no longer a threat,” Pittman said. “Why [were] additional shots fired?” In the video, an unidentified person the group said was a witness, can be heard saying the initial shot “was enough.” “He wasn’t a threat after that,” Pittman said. Fayetteville Man Killed by Off-Duty Cop Was ‘Shot in the Back,’ Says Attorney Ben Crump According to Blagrove, police were using the presence of the pocket knife, which Turcios had not used to “crazily try to attack anyone,” to “manipulate the tragic outcome” and justify the murder. A spokesperson for Raleigh Police Department told The Daily Beast on Tuesday that ​​“a brief written report of the incident” would be sent to the city manager and released publicly on Wednesday. In witness video from the incident, circulated online and published by the News & Observer, Turcios can be seen stumbling away from the crash scene with the alleged pocket knife before he was tased. As officers encircled him, he appeared to rouse himself and scuffle with officers before an officer shot him. “Why was it necessary for Daniel to be physically detained in the first place?” Blagrove said Tuesday, adding that the group hoped to help Turcios’ family seek accountability and closure, particularly if the death was preventable. Turcios immigrated to the U.S. about 20 years ago from a small town in El Salvador, family friends told the News & Observer. His family, including wife Rosa Jerez, made an appearance at Tuesday’s news conference. Through tears, Jerez detailed the horrific encounter, alleging that officers killed her husband “like a dog.” “They killed him in front of me and my children,” Jerez said in Spanish. “I told them to leave him alone. He’s not doing anything to you. They didn’t listen.” In tears, Daniel Turcios’ wife shared a few words about her husband and says RPD officers shot and killed her husband “like a dog”. The family feels his death was preventable. pic.twitter.com/LoXrJHAI7q — DeJuan Hoggard (@DeJuanABC11) January 18, 2022 Jerez created a GoFundMe page to pay for her husband’s funeral expenses and send his remains to El Salvador. It remains unclear from the clips how many shots were fired and how much time elapsed in between, but Blagrove insisted the footage “clearly indicates” that Turcios was shot “multiple times”—and that a “significant delay” between the first and second shots should warrant “more than an internal affairs investigation.” Patterson announced an internal probe last week, noting that its findings would be used to determine whether the officers had violated department policy. She said the probe would run parallel to a State Bureau of Investigation probe. “I want to say that I want to wait until we have all of the information, before making any decisions or before making any statements concerning whether the shooting was justified or was not justified,” Patterson said. The officer who shot Turcios has not been publicly identified but was put on administrative duty, which isn’t enough, according to Blagrove. “If history tells us anything, it is going to tell us that the police are not capable of policing themselves,” Blagrove said. “And we need independent, objective individuals to investigate police-involved shootings and any allegations of police misconduct, for that matter.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

1/19/2022,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russia is a sending an unspecified number of troops from the country’s far east to Belarus for major war games, officials said Tuesday, a deployment that will further beef up Russian military presence near Ukraine amid Western fears of a planned invasion. Amid the soaring tensions, the White House warned that Russia could attack its neighbor at “any point,” while the U.K. delivered a batch of anti-tank weapons to Ukraine. Russia's Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin said the joint drills with Belarus would involve practicing a joint response to external threats. Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia could launch an attack on Ukraine from several directions, including from its ally Belarus. The U.S. again stressed its concern Tuesday, with White House press secretary Jen Psaki describing the Russian forces' move into Belarus as part of as “extremely dangerous situation.” “We’re now at a stage where Russia could at any point launch an attack in Ukraine,” she said. A series of talks last week between Russia, the U.S. and NATO failed to quell the tensions over Ukraine. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will meet his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Geneva on Friday in another attempt to defuse the crisis. Ukraine's Defense Ministry said Tuesday it has received a shipment of anti-tank weapons from the U.K., noting that they will help “strengthen our defense capability.” Russia already has started moving troops for the war games in Belarus. Fomin said it would take through Feb. 9 to fully deploy weapons and personnel for the Allied Resolve 2022 drills, which are expected to take place Feb. 10-20. Fomin didn't say how many troops will be involved, but mentioned that Russia will deploy a dozen Su-35 fighter jets and several air defense units to Belarus. The deployment would bolster an estimated 100,000 Russian troops with tanks and other heavy weapons who are already amassed near Ukraine. Russia has denied that it intends to attack its neighbor but demanded guarantees from the West that NATO will not expand to Ukraine or other former Soviet nations or place its troops and weapons there. Washington and its allies firmly rejected Moscow’s demands during Russia-U.S. negotiations in Geneva and a related NATO-Russia meeting in Brussels last week. Fomin said the drills in Belarus, which involve an unspecified number of troops from Russia's Eastern Military District, reflect the need to practice concentrating the country's entire military potential in the west. ""A situation may arise when forces and means of the regional group of forces will be insufficient to ensure reliable security of the union state, and we must be ready to strengthen it,"" Fomin said at a meeting with foreign military attaches. “We have reached an understanding with Belarus that it's necessary to engage the entire military potential for joint defense.” Belarus' authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said the joint maneuvers will be conducted on Belarus’ western border and in the country’s south, where it borders Ukraine. Lukashenko, who has edged increasingly close to Russia amid Western sanctions over his government's crackdown on domestic protests, has recently offered to host Russian nuclear weapons. A senior Biden administration official said the Russian troop deployment to Belarus raises concerns that Moscow may be planning to stage troops there to stretch Ukraine’s defenses with an attack from the north. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive issues, noted that the movement may also indicate Belarus’ willingness “to allow both Russian conventional and nuclear forces to be stationed on its territory.” Amid the tensions, Ukraine's Defense Ministry said Tuesday that it was speeding up efforts to form reserve battalions that would allow for the rapid deployment of 130,000 recruits to expand the country's 246,000-strong military. The United States and its allies have urged Russia to deescalate the situation by calling back the troops amassed near Ukraine. “In recent weeks, more than 100,000 Russian troops with tanks and guns have gathered near Ukraine without an understandable reason, and it’s hard not to understand that as a threat,” German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told reporters Tuesday after talks in Moscow with her Russian counterpart, Lavrov. Lavrov responded by restating Moscow's argument that it's free to deploy its forces wherever it considers it necessary on its territory. “We can’t accept demands about our armed forces on our own territory,” Lavrov said. “We aren’t threatening anyone, but we are hearing threats to us."" Baerbock emphasized that the West was ready ""for a serious dialogue on mutual agreements and steps to bring everyone in Europe more security.” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin on Tuesday. He said “the main task now is to make progress on the political way forward” to prevent a military attack against Ukraine. “NATO allies are ready to meet with Russia again, and today I have invited Russia and all the NATO allies to attend a series of meetings in the NATO-Russia Council in the near future to address our concerns but also listen to Russia’s concerns,"" Stoltenberg said. He added that NATO “in the near future” will deliver its written proposals in response to Russian demands and ""hopefully we can begin meeting after that.” “We need to see what Russia says, and that will be a kind of pivotal moment,” the NATO chief said. Lavrov, meanwhile, reaffirmed that Russia wants a quick Western answer to its demand for security guarantees that would preclude NATO's expansion to Ukraine and limit its presence in Eastern Europe. He repeated that in a phone conversation with Blinken, who will visit Ukraine on Wednesday and meet with Lavrov on Friday. Speaking on a visit Tuesday to Ukraine, Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly denounced the Russian troop buildup as unacceptable. She noted Canada's efforts to help train Ukraine's military, adding that it's currently considering Ukraine's demand to provide it with military equipment and will make “a decision in a timely manner.” Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 after the ouster of Ukraine’s Moscow-friendly leader and also threw its weight behind a separatist insurgency that took over large sections in eastern Ukraine. More than 14,000 people have been killed in nearly eight years of fighting there. ___ Aamer Madhani and Ellen Knickmeyer in Washington, Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lorne Cook in Brussels, and Yuras Karmanau in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed to this report.",World/Associated Press,Russia moves more troops westward amid Ukraine tensions,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-moves-more-troops-westward-144218341.html
