4/25/2022,"A tourist has been charged with flouting strict no-fly zone rules after crashing a drone into the roof of a prominent monument in central Rome in the latest drone-related tourist mishap in Italy. The Argentinian man, 39, had been flying his drone in Piazza Venezia when he lost control of the device and sent it crashing into the roof of Palazzo Venezia, a 15th-century building from where the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini delivered some of his most famous speeches. The drone was recovered by the building’s security staff before being seized by police, who reported the tourist for failing to comply with a no-fly drone zone over the city, according to reports in the Italian media. People who want to film or take shots of the Italian capital from above with a drone must get permission and be registered with Enac, the national body for civil aviation. Piloting a drone in central Rome and the Vatican is completely out-of-bounds because of all the precious monuments. However, tourists appear to be oblivious to the rules. Last week, two Mexican tourists crashed their drone into the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The brother and sister faced police action for breaking no-fly rules around the Tuscan city’s famous landmark. In 2020, a 40-year-old tourist from Poland crashed his drone inside the Colosseum despite having been warned that piloting the device inside the ancient amphitheatre was banned. In July last year, a 61-year-old man was charged with an “attack against transport security” after flying his drone above Rome at an altitude of 2,000 metres. The man, who was a member of a Facebook page for drone fanatics, was reported after his device was seen by a professional pilot. Fortunately there have been no reports of damage to monuments due to the impact of crashing drones. Penalties imposed have not been reported either, but fines for violating drone rules range from €516 to €64,000. Italy celebrates Liberation Day on Monday, marking the 77th year since the country’s liberation from German occupation and fascist rule. Mussolini made some of his most famous speeches from the balcony of Palazzo Venezia, including declaring war against Britain and France on 10 June 1940. The building now houses a museum.",News/World news,Tourist crashes drone into Rome monument in latest mishap,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/25/tourist-crashes-drone-into-rome-monument-piazza-venezia
4/25/2022,"Asda has said it will spend £73m to cut or freeze prices on 100 products, while Morrisons says it will cut prices on 500 products as Britain’s supermarkets fight to keep customers amid rising inflation. The Morrisons products subject to price cuts represent 6% of its total sales, and include items such as eggs, cereal, cooking sauces, chicken and sausages. Asda said its price reductions would be on fresh fruit and vegetables, fresh meat, rice and noodles. Recent increases in oil prices, global supply chain disruption caused by coronavirus lockdowns and Russia’s war on Ukraine have fuelled soaring inflation across the world, putting a strain on household finances. British supermarkets are trying to preserve their market share, and the big four – Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons – are watching the growing competition from the German discounters Aldi and Lidl. Although there are concerns over the economy’s momentum, supermarkets are also competing for staff amid a tight labour market. Asda on Monday said it will increase pay for workers to £10.10 an hour from July, matching earlier increases from Tesco and Lidl. Asda had faced criticism from the GMB union for having the lowest-paid workers of the big chains, at £9.66 an hour. Nadine Houghton, a GMB national officer, said the pay increase was “fantastic news”. “Retail workers, predominantly women, face the reality of living with low pay every day,” she said. “Employers everywhere need to step up and properly reward these key workers who keep our high streets running.” Asda’s price-steadying measures will coincide with the launch of its new “Just Essentials” products to replace its budget “Smart Price” range. Asda is spending £45m on introducing the products from next month, although it is also facing a potential problem after its rival Waitrose threatened it with legal action, arguing that the branding impinged on its own “Essentials” range. David Potts, the Morrisons chief executive, said: “We know that our customers are under real financial pressure at the moment and we want to play our part in helping them when it comes to the cost of grocery shopping. These price cuts will have a noticeable and long-term impact on our customers’ budgets and demonstrate our commitment to offering them the best possible value.” Mohsin Issa, the co-owner of Asda after a debt-funded takeover last year, said: “We know that household budgets are being squeezed by an increasing cost of living and we are committed to doing everything we can to support our customers, colleagues and communities in these exceptionally tough times.” He added that Asda’s move was an “unprecedented action to give families some additional stability and certainty in their weekly shopping”.",News/Business,Asda and Morrisons cut prices as supermarkets fight for customers,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/25/asda-morrisons-cut-prices-supermarkets-aldi-lidl
4/25/2022,"Thousands of Hongkongers escaping from China’s increasingly authoritarian grip on the city have settled in Britain over the past year in search of a new life. This fresh start comes via the British national (overseas) visa scheme. More than 88,000 Hongkongers applied for the BNO visa, launched last January, in its first eight months, according to Home Office figures. It allows them to live, study and work in Britain for five years. Once that time is up, BNO holders can apply to stay permanently. The government is expecting about 300,000 people to use this new route to citizenship in the next five years. Middle-class families and young professionals are fuelling this new wave of immigration. The crackdown on the 2019 pro-democracy protests, along with the introduction of a national security law in 2020, which allows authorities to curtail civil liberties and stamp out political dissent, was a step too far for many. Of those who have left, the majority are not planning on returning. They realise the Hong Kong they once knew and loved has gone. Here, five Hongkongers with BNO visas talk about their lives in Britain and why they decided to leave their home country. ​​The year before we left was really upsetting. You would watch the news and see police beating up young people. I was afraid for my 10-year-old daughter. I used to be a teacher in an international school. But I wanted to make a fresh start here, so I decided to become a care worker. I love meeting and working with different people. It’s much cheaper in England compared with Hong Kong. Property prices are three or four times lower in parts of Berkshire. But being here has nothing to do with money. You can’t buy freedom, you can’t buy democracy. I can’t buy back the Hong Kong I used to have. My husband and I used to go to the protests with our daughter. I wanted the government to know that we were not happy about the extradition bill and how they were treating people. In the beginning, I thought if more people protested peacefully, the government would stop imposing a law we didn’t want, but it just became more violent. I remember the day we went to Causeway Bay [a major retail district]. We started to chant slogans and sing songs. Suddenly, I could hear shooting and people started running in different directions. They were screaming and trying to find a place to hide. It was horrible. My daughter said: “We didn’t do anything wrong.” At that moment, I realised we had to leave Hong Kong. I was really sad to say goodbye to my parents, my brother and my in-laws. They think if they keep silent, if they don’t criticise the government, they will be fine. I’m very happy here. But that doesn’t mean other people are OK. I know some BNO holders don’t like it because it’s too cold, because they don’t speak English, because it’s not easy to find a job, or they can’t find the same job that they had in Hong Kong. But it was the right decision for us to come. Here, you’re not forced to love Britain or the Conservative party. Mainland China will say that you have to love the Chinese Communist party. Even though I live in England now, I’m still worried that I might get into trouble back home if I reveal my name and my face. Some of my Hong Kong friends keep asking me: “Have you experienced any discrimination, or do you feel like a second-class citizen?” But it’s very multicultural here. People are friendly and respectful. I’m optimistic about the future. I hope I can stay here permanently. Before I came here last August with my wife, I watched some YouTube videos to find out which area we could live in. We joined a Facebook group for Hongkongers when we arrived, and we’ve made some friends through that. Every time I go out where I live in a suburban part of London, I see lots of Hongkongers on the street. I think they may be BNO holders. When I went to the hospital to register our Covid vaccination records, they said they had about 20 to 30 Hongkongers coming every day. Hong Kong is no longer like Hong Kong. If you say something the government doesn’t like, you’ll get in trouble. Every day you see people getting arrested. I’ve had some friends who were arrested for being at the protests. They weren’t violent, they didn’t destroy anything, but they were arrested because they were there. Before 2019, I wasn’t the kind of person who cared that much about politics. But one day, I saw some people protesting and I thought: “Why should it only be young people doing it?” These issues affect everyone. That’s why I decided to join the protests. I wanted to be on the street, so we could tell the government what we thought. But nothing changed. My wife and I decided to leave because we want to have children. The education system in Hong Kong is brainwashing kids. A few months ago, a primary school played a video about the Nanjing massacre [by Japanese forces in 1937]. That’s crazy. Children were crying. The BNO scheme gives people a chance to start a new life. If the government didn’t offer it, most of us wouldn’t have anywhere to go. Emigrating is expensive; not everyone is able to do it. Compared with emigrating to other countries, the costs are reasonable. We paid about £3,000 each. I’ve heard a lot of stories about how difficult it is for BNO holders to find work. But I was able to find a job as a sales analyst, similar to the one I had in Hong Kong, so it turned out better than I expected. I still check the news to see what’s happening in Hong Kong, but it’s not easy to access information any more. Most of the newspapers that you could trust to tell the truth are closed and the publications that have survived won’t speak out. It’s sad. You can’t shut something down just because it has a different point of view. At least with the BNO scheme, people around the world know what happened to us back in Hong Kong. I came to England last July. For the past month, I’ve been working as a regional coordinator for Hongkongers in Britain. I’ve been organising some seminars for BNO visa holders to try to find out how we can help them integrate into UK life. I used to be an activist. I was arrested during the protests and sent to court. Luckily, I was found not guilty. A Chinese Communist party-supporting newspaper in Hong Kong wrote an article about me, and I was worried I might be arrested again. Most of my activist friends are in jail now. If I wasn’t at risk, I would stay in Hong Kong. The government said the national security law only affects some people. But that’s not true. It’s like a knife on your neck, and you don’t know what you might say or do to make it cut you. Everybody is frightened. I still haven’t settled down here because I haven’t found a place to live long-term yet. I’ve travelled around from Rotherham to Sheffield to Warrington to Manchester to Bristol, and I’ve come back to Sheffield. Many people who have the visa are finding it difficult to rent because they don’t have a job. My friend and I have been putting on community events in Sheffield for Hongkongers. I’ve met some people here who understand what happened in Hong Kong, and they have welcomed us. In a few years, I’ll reach retirement age. I think England is a good place for people to have a quiet life. I’m safe now. I don’t have to worry that one day I might be arrested. But I’m still thinking about the young people who don’t have the right to apply for a visa [the scheme is only open to people over 18 who have BNO status. They can bring over their dependents, but their children can’t apply independently. There are now plans to change this]. Young people need it more than older people. I would like to go back to Hong Kong. But if the political environment doesn’t change, I can’t. I miss my family and my friends. But Hong Kong is very different now to how it was before. I used to hold an event every year to celebrate Hong Kong culture. Last year, some people came who I suspected were connected with China, and took a lot of photos of the visitors. I was concerned about whether it was still safe to organise cultural festivals. I’m also writing a book about the history of Hong Kong. If I want to write without worrying about the authorities, I have to move to a free country. I left last April. I used to work as a research assistant. It’s hard to find a job doing what I did back in Hong Kong. But if you just want some money, it’s easy to get a job as a waiter or in sales. The British army is now accepting BNO visa holders, so some friends of mine have applied to join. I found work for a few months in research, now I’m writing part-time about Hong Kong and colonial studies. For the first two months here, I was living in a hostel. I started to look for a spare room, which was hard because, at that time, I didn’t have a job and landlords need you to have a job so they know you can pay the rent. Luckily, I met someone who was aware of the situation in Hong Kong and told me I could rent a room in his house. I miss the landscape in Hong Kong and living by the sea. But in Britain, you can dress however you like, you can have your own identity, you’re free to express what you think. Back in Hong Kong, you’re always afraid people will criticise or judge you. Here, people are more tolerant. One time, on the tube, I saw an old gentleman dressed like Elton John. It wasn’t Friday night, it was in the morning. People were smiling. If you dressed like that in Hong Kong on the MTR [Mass Transit Railway], people would think you’re very weird and just stare at you. I’m here for five years, so there’s time to explore my new life and not feel rushed. Also, we have been holding the British passport since we were born, so it’s like we are overseas citizens who are moving back, even though it’s a country many of us have never visited. We would like to buy a house but it has been difficult to get a mortgage. Banks have turned us down because we have been living here for less than a year. When we came over, last March, a British friend helped us to find a house to rent, which could have been tricky with two large dogs and three children. I’m a housewife. My husband was working as a PR consultant in Hong Kong and found a job here as a project manager for an NGO. His work is quite political, so we needed to leave. We also decided that it’s not a good place to raise children any more. Because of the national security law, we have to censor what we say. We have some friends in jail because they’re journalists. It’s horrible. When freedom of press no longer exists, the truth cannot be revealed. I want my kids to be raised in a place where truth is important. It’s sad because Hong Kong is very beautiful. Everything collapsed in a very short period of time. I hope that, one day, it can go back to how it used to be and we can return to the old Hong Kong values, where democracy and freedom were important. Now, we need to educate our kids so that when they grow up, they have the choice to either go back to Hong Kong or stay in the UK. I still have family there, and I want to be able to visit them in the future, so I’d rather not have my name published. I’m worried about my safety. Hong Kong is quite strange to me now and Britain is more familiar. I grew up when Hong Kong was still a British colony, so that makes it easy for me to adapt to the British way of life. I like how green England is. My youngest son loves playing football. He used to play rugby in Hong Kong. Also, here, even though people might not agree with you, they will still be respectful. But it’s been hard getting used to the weather. It’s quite wet most of the time and I need sunshine! I’m planning on opening a cafe in the future. I want to introduce people to Hong Kong cuisine. Hopefully, it can become a place where Hongkongers can gather and make friends with local people. All names have been changed.",News/World news,‘Hong Kong is strange to me now’: how five refugees are finding their new lives in Britain,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/25/hong-kong-refugees-britain-hongkongers-visa-scheme-crackdown
4/25/2022,"When 17-year-old Michael Chang won the French Open in 1989, it was a huge event for American tennis. Not only was it the story of a teenager coming from seemingly nowhere to win a major, it also represented the end of a nearly (gasp!) five-year drought of men’s slam champions for the United States. After all, never before had there been more than four consecutive calendar years in the entire history of the sport when an American had not claimed one of the four slams. Chang’s victory ushered in a golden age for American men’s tennis. He was joined by Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi and Jim Courier. Collectively the group won a total of 27 grand slam titles (with Sampras’s 14 leading the way) over a 15-year period, from Chang’s win in Paris through to Agassi’s last major, at the Australian Open in 2003. And things seemed to be just fine for the next generation of American men after Andy Roddick, then just 21, won the US Open later in 2003. Considered the future of American tennis since he was a teenager, Roddick had seemingly fulfilled his promise. Most thought his lethal serve would help him to a few more majors on fast surfaces before his career ended. But it never happened. While Roddick had a hall of fame career that included finishing as a year-end No 1, he also had the misfortune of playing in the same era as Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. Roddick would reach another four grand slam finals, and four times he would come away the runner-up to Federer (his 2009 five-set Wimbledom defeat to the Swiss was particularly heartbreaking). And so, in year 19, when will the drought end? Why can’t the men equal their female compatriots Serena and Venus Williams, Sofia Kenin and Sloane Stephens, who have won 22 grand slams between them over the same period. Whatever the reasons may be, something is slowly changing and it appears that we are perhaps close to a period when American men again will be a major threat at the slams. Two Masters-level tournaments this spring have showcased the superb play of two young players in particular: 24 year-old Taylor Fritz and his doubles partner Sebastian Korda, 21. In March, at his home-state tournament at Indian Wells, Fritz won his first Masters title. And not only that but he defeated Nadal in the final to accomplish his career-defining victory. While some would affix an asterisk to Fritz’s victory due to the fact that Nadal was nursing an injury, that analysis shouldn’t carry too much weight since Fritz also easily defeated world No 7 Andrey Rublev in straight sets in the semi-final. It was the authoritative fashion in which Fritz won the title that was so impressive – powerful serving, varied groundstrokes and patient-yet-aggressive forays into the forecourt. Fritz, a former junior US Open champion, has finally built an all-around game to go with his huge promise. And then just last week at the Monte Carlo Masters, Korda upended the man who has been declared the future of the sport, Carlos Alcaraz. Though Korda eventually lost in the fourth round (to Fritz, as it happens), his victory over the Spaniard sent a clear signal that he is on the verge of breaking through at the bigger events. What makes Korda such a hot topic among the tennis cognoscenti is the preternatural ease of his game, which reminds many of Sampras. His silky smooth service motion is difficult to read and his ability to finish points off at the net makes him a clear danger on all surfaces. Further, Korda’s lineage is helping the young star develop at his own speed. His father, Petr, won the Australian Open in 1998 (his sisters, Nelly and Jessica, are elite golfers and used to world-class sport too). Petr has made a point of instill a degree of perspective in his son, making sure he does not get caught up in his early success. And the fact that Korda and Fritz both did well on the red dirt of Monte Carlo runs counter to history. With the exception of the 1990s, US men have never done particularly well on clay. But both Fritz and Korda are adept on all surfaces, which is an entirely refreshing change of pace from the big-serve-big-forehand style of recent American players. While Fritz, currently ranked 13th and Korda, 37th, are the two American men best poised to lift a slam trophy in the near future, there are several others who deserve a mention. Reilly Opelka, whose 6ft 11in frame delivers one of the tour’s most intimidating serves, is ranked just below Fritz at 17. As Opelka continues to utilize his improved foot speed to go along with his lethal serve, he’s sure to make waves at the slams. On the other end of the power spectrum is Jenson Brooksby. Though he doesn’t have a huge serve or particularly powerful groundstrokes, he does own an impressive tennis IQ and an innate ability to annoy and frustrate his foes, disrupting the rhythm of a match with off-pace shots and varied spin, that leave his opponents flummoxed. The 21-year-old is ranked 39th and will probably be in the top 20 by year’s end. Frances Tiafoe, meanwhile, has perhaps not fulfilled his early promise but is a consistent top 30 player. The cynics may scoff at the notion that Americans are ready to become a power in men’s tennis again. Sure, they’re showing signs of life, but that’s only because Nadal, Federer and Djokovic are finally on a slow decline. But you can only play who you are up against. And right now Fritz, Korda and several other young Americans look poised to take up permanent residency in the top 10. Perhaps the dawning of a new golden age of American men’s tennis players is upon us.",Sport/Sport,The US hasn’t had a male grand slam champ since 2003.

4/25/2022,"Sri Lanka is in revolt. Since early April, thousands of protesters have taken to the streets, initially to demand a solution to what has been dubbed the “worst economic crisis since independence”. Now, in the face of a political stalemate, and after police fatally shot one protester and wounded 13 others, regime change is top of the agenda. One element of the protests has been particularly striking: they have united groups that were previously starkly divided, and who have begun sharing analysis of what – and who – split them apart in the first place. “Here you have the Sinhala Buddhist majority protesting side by side with Tamils. You have trade union protests happening next to Muslim protests where Muslims are breaking their fast under the rainbow umbrellas of the LGBTQ community,” said the Guardian’s Hannah Ellis-Peterson on the Today in Focus podcast. “This has never been seen before in Sri Lanka. People are talking about a […] betrayal, that they were fed this lie of majority and minority, nationalist and divisive politics. They feel like this is the thing that has ultimately caused the destruction of Sri Lanka.” In a Buddhist-majority country, where the persecution of Muslims has become a winning strategy for the politically dominant Rajapaksa family, economic disaster has finally blasted through artificially constructed walls of separation. It makes me wonder: just what point of crisis will Britain have to reach before we follow suit? This is not a new train of thought. In the past I’ve often fantasised about just what it would take to see sustained mass action that would result in long-lasting, positive change rather than a temporary stay of execution on some individual cruel policy. I cannot remember a moment more desperate than the current one. Yet despite general anger directed against the government, narratives of division – stoked by politicians and amplified by media – still prevail over all else, stymying the sort of public unity seen in Sri Lanka. While we are not quite as divided as we think we are, British political identities, now stronger than party alignments, give a warped view of what the “other side” believes, both about topline issues and their opposition. Research from King’s College London found that 91% of leave supporters agree with the statement: “The NHS is crucial to British society and we must do everything we can to maintain it.” But only 60% of non-leave supporters predicted that Brexit backers would hold this view. Similarly, less than a quarter of surveyed Brexiters expressed climate denial beliefs. Remainers thought the results would be double that. Even when there is agreement between groups with ostensibly different political identities, that is not enough to bridge the gulf. Dislike is so strong based on a single issue that people can’t see all the sections of the Venn diagram where their views overlap. A deep fear of each other and the beliefs others might hold has taken root. Studies warn that a “hostile culture of ‘othering’ political rivals can spill over into social relations”. Speaking about politics with a stranger has transformed from a potentially awkward endeavour to a minefield. An acquaintance of mine recounted meeting a couple in a Soho pub the other day. They got on well; the couple bought a round. Conversation turned to the police. Tentatively, he ventured that he thought policing had deep problems. The couple reacted so vehemently that my acquaintance thought they had misheard his mild statement. Eventually the encounter ended with them screaming at him until he left the pub. Political disagreement now is expressed through anger and escalation; coalition seems light years away. I’ve seen this up close, on non-partisan issues that should unite everyone. Take climate protesters. Physical attacks by fellow members of the public on the likes of Insulate Britain have become horrifyingly normalised. In polling by the Sunday Express, 53% of respondents believed that “eco-extremists” should be penalised with harsher criminal punishment. You might read this and agree; that protesters have “gone too far” by blocking roads in their successful attempt to keep the issue of insulating houses (an action that would save every single person in Britain money, and which is essential to meeting climate goals) on the agenda. But even the act of being seen to support a greener future marks one out as a suspect character in some spaces, for murky reasons that have nothing to do with renewables and everything to do with how lines of division have been drawn. Last November, I walked into two separate pubs after a climate protest and was called a “cunt” and a “dickhead” simply for clutching an upside-down sign asking for change. Sans sign, I’ve never had a problem in pubs. But with that accidental political act (I just wanted a rum and a sit down), I became the embodiment of a set of beliefs that have been cast as “other” by divisive, nationalistic rhetoric that seeks to position anyone demanding positive change (such as warmer, affordable houses) as disruptive, unpatriotic and the very cause of this country’s disunity. And for those with me, the people insulting us represented a public blindly following whatever hateful narrative they are fed, poisoning themselves in the process. Do either of those positions bring us closer to persuading each other of our concerns, or bringing about the change we so desperately desire? The more disempowered people feel by the apparent inability to hold elected representatives to account, the more they turn on each other. Even within demographics supposedly on the “same side”, such as leftwing spaces, petty purity politics has taken root. Sniping at one another’s credentials has become an outlet in the face of disillusionment and political alienation. Ideally, it shouldn’t take a crisis to create a coalition. But I’m starting to worry that not even desperate times will call for undivided measures. We need to direct our fire towards the people in power, to do as Sri Lankan protesters have done and recognise in practice what we know in theory: that division is a political tool, and one we have been all too susceptible to. Is the British public still capable of rediscovering the commonalities that could chart an eventual course of escape from our current misery? I have to believe so. Cauterising this festering wound is still an option. It’s the only one that offers a future built on solidarity. Otherwise we’ll rot from the inside out.

4/25/2022,"There is no shortage of standup that takes the raw material of hapless, disappointing life and turns it into laughter. That’s a sizable part of what comedy does. But for big, big laughter fashioned from pretty severe instances of disappointment, look no further than James Acaster’s career-best 2018 show, Cold Lasagne Hate Myself 1999. It takes two low moments in the Kettering man’s life (being dumped by his girlfriend in favour of, er, Mr Bean; and being dumped by his agent after an on-air PR gaffe) and – in two hours of gasp-inducing, gut-bustingly funny standup – recasts those disappointments as mere staging posts on the route to comedy glory. Brian Logan Disappointment hangs over Betty Suarez, the Latina titular character of Ugly Betty, like a sword of Damocles, waiting for the moment to finally tear her apart. The series begins with her disenchanted: her job as an assistant at Mode magazine is unglamorous, and her colleagues are visibly displeased at being forced to accommodate her poncho, braces and sanguine confidence – attributes that are “unchic” in the world of mid-2000s high fashion. It makes for ironic viewing now: transplant Betty into the 2020s and you can imagine her with a viral Instagram account focused on thrifting and sustainability; Mode’s cruel receptionist Amanda, the apparent embodiment of the 00s “it girl”, would be left behind in her wake. Jason Okundaye Very few bands convert sadness into elegance quite like Radiohead. Although Thom Yorke’s writing often revolves round menacing, downtrodden critiques of consumerist culture, the chorus of Kid A’s Optimistic makes use of one uplifting mantra: “You try the best you can / You try the best you can / The best you can is good enough”. At times of self-doubt, my partner often recites this chorus to me, temporarily accepting its meaning independently from the song. It’s a simple phrasing, but a welcome reminder nonetheless that in life and lyricism, we have to learn from our failures. Jenessa Williams Eleven-year-old Luke Parker’s knowledge of comics is encyclopedic. Costumes, symbols, abilities, origins – he’s a superhero savant. This makes it still more galling that while he nips off for a wee, his maths-obsessed older brother Zack is given superpowers by a visiting alien. Luke’s jealous disappointment, coupled with his determination to mentor Zack (or at least get him wearing a cape), shapes David Solomons’s hilarious novel My Brother Is a Superhero, full of fraying fraternal bonds and a mission to save not one, but two worlds that will need all Luke’s knowhow – as well as Zack’s powers – to succeed. Imogen Russell Williams In the 1949 film The Heiress, Catherine (Olivia de Havilland), a wealthy but dowdy disappointment to her autocratic father, falls hard for Morris (Montgomery Clift), who in turn disappoints her. William Wyler’s gripping melodrama is a dazzling depiction of disillusion, providing De Havilland with an extraordinary, Oscar-winning role, in which she adjusts the wick on her natural luminosity like it’s a gas lamp that can bathe the room in brightness or make shadows leap large across the wall. The sorrow of the underestimated, unloved soul pervades the film but Catherine’s final act of vengeful disdain makes it also the cruellest success story, as a wilting wallflower comes to know her intrinsic self-worth as never before.

4/25/2022,"Alluding to the riot that greeted the first performance of The Rite of Spring in 1913, the title of the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain’s latest concert with Carlos Miguel Prieto was Open Up: Running Riot!, and Stravinsky’s groundbreaking ballet was the closing work of a programme that dealt with dismantling cultural divisions and pushing at the boundaries of tradition. Its companion pieces were both relatively recent. Gabriela Ortiz’s Téenek – Invenciones de Territorio (2017) takes its name from the language spoken in the Huasteca region of northern Mexico. Ortiz self-consciously celebrates ideas of diversity and difference within a global unity, while her style, all asymmetric rhythms and angular melodies, takes The Rite of Spring as its point of departure. Ortiz has added a newly written Frontispiece for Téenek, in which the performers arrive on the platform to repetitive woodblock taps, over which they play an exhilarating sequence of bravura riffs, before Prieto finally appears to launch the main body of the work. The Tabla Concerto, by Sri Lankan-born, Canadian composer Dinuk Wijeratne, meanwhile, is an east-west fusion at once beguiling, deeply serious and joyous. Adhering to formal, and to some extent harmonic convention, Wijeratne creates an entirely original soundscape in which the tabla engages with music that gazes alternately at western baroque and Indian folk, before reaching a finale in which the soloist plays complex variations over slow-moving chordal progressions. Sandeep Das, looking natty in crimson silk and clearly having the time of his life with it, played with staggering virtuosity. The NYOGB sounded wonderful here too, with a gorgeous sheen on the strings and beautifully poised woodwind and brass solos. The concert was dedicated to young people in Ukraine, and an arrangement of a Ukrainian folk song, sorrowful, timeless and deeply touching, was played by a chamber ensemble and hummed by the rest of the orchestra before The Rite of Spring itself. Prieto conducted it like one possessed, with extraordinary ferocity and drive. Just occasionally, detail slipped in the excitement of it all, but with more than 160 players on the platform, the sheer sonic weight was simply pulverising.",Arts/Music,"NYOGB/Prieto review – ferocity, virtuosity and sheer joy",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/25/nyogb-prieto-carlos-miguel-prieto-review-open-up-running-riot-royal-festival-hall
4/25/2022,"The NFL draft, which starts on Thursday, has become a spectacular, three-day, wall-to-wall TV blowout watched by millions. But Upton Bell insists that its basic appeal has not changed all that much since the first draft was held 86 years ago. “It’s the great American crapshoot,” Bell tells the Guardian from his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, referring to the uncertain future of any draftee – or the team that drafts him. Upton Bell, a pro football executive for years, is the 84-year-old son of the late De Benneville Bell, who was known to everyone as Bert and served as NFL commissioner from 1946 until 1959, when he suffered a fatal heart attack at a Philadelphia Eagles home game. Thirteen years before he became commissioner, Bell was the co-owner (and later head coach) of the Eagles, then a new NFL team. The Eagles struggled on the field and at the gate in their first few seasons, and Bell was frustrated that the best college players were scooped up by the bigger pro teams. Bell had placed a telephone call in 1933 to a talented fullback and linebacker from the University of Minnesota named Stanley Kostka. Bell told Kostka that he was willing to offer him more money than every other NFL team. Kostka said he was interested. But Kostka “hemmed and hawed,” Bell told the Associated Press years later, because the NFL’s Brooklyn Dodgers (yes, the Brooklyn Football Dodgers) had offered him $3,500 a year. Bell offered $4,000 (worth around $87,000 today). Kostka wanted to see if the Dodgers would make a counteroffer, but claimed he could not reach them by phone. When Bell offered $6,000, Kostka balked again. Bell took the offer off the table and went home. Kostka signed with the Dodgers, probably because he felt that, as an established team, they were a safer bet than the Eagles. Bell figured his team – and maybe the league – would not stay afloat for long if the big NFL teams continued to hoover up the best college players. “He could see into the future,” Upton Bell says. “He could see problems immediately. The league would have been gone by 1939 or 1940.” He adds, “As long as there was no draft, players could pit one team against another.” At the time, the NFL had four powerhouse teams: the Chicago Bears, the New York Giants, the Green Bay Packers and the team now known as the Washington Commanders. Bell, however, insisted that the league would only be as strong as its weakest link. Upton Bell says of his father, “He knew who he had to get to – he knew the real power in the league was George Halas,” referring to the Bears’ founder and coach. In his memoir, Halas wrote of the draft: “I thought the proposal [was] sound. It made sense.” The owners’ vote was unanimous. Bell would take several decisive actions as commissioner: preventing gamblers from overtaking the game, overseeing a merger with the rival All-American Football Conference, negotiating the league’s first big television contract and beginning talks for a pension for players. To this day, though, Upton Bell fields calls from reporters who start an interview with, “Tell me about your father and the NFL draft.” Upton Bell was a personnel director for the Baltimore Colts, general manager for the New England Patriots and a co-owner of the Charlotte Hornets of the World Football League, but he happily retells the stories about his dad, knowing that memories fade away. Of lasting quality is the NFL Draft 1936 sculpture in Canton, Ohio, home of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Four football players in leather helmets and three-point stances flank a man in a suit and fedora about to snap a football. The man in the fedora is Bert Bell. Upton Bell later became a sports commentator, participating in PBS’s NFL draft coverage in 1977 and ESPN’s first NFL draft telecast in 1980 from the network’s studios in Bristol, Connecticut. (ESPN also had a small desk outside the draft at the New York Sheraton.) Even that was a far cry from the coverage the first draft received – which was, essentially, nothing. The 1936 draft was held in Philadelphia at the Ritz Carlton Hotel, which happened to be owned by Bert Bell’s father. Names of players were erased from a chalkboard after they were chosen in the nine-round draft. Even the Philadelphia newspapers skipped the event. “Franchise owners crowded into Bert Bell’s hotel room, shucked their jackets and cleared sitting room on beds and bureaus,” Robert Lipsyte wrote in the New York Times in 1968. “Bottles circulated, solemn oaths of league solidarity were taken, and the college stars were distributed.” By virtue of their 2-9 record in 1935, Bell’s Eagles had the first pick, choosing an exciting halfback from the University of Chicago named Jay Berwanger, who’d just won the first Downtown Athletic Club Trophy. (It was renamed the Heisman Trophy a year later.) Berwanger wanted $1,000 a game, far above the Eagles’ offer of $150, and his rights were traded to Chicago. Berwanger never did play professional football. Bell had to wait until 1939 to sign a first-round pick: TCU quarterback Davey O’Brien, who’d go to the Hall of Fame. The draft was not all that beneficial to Bert Bell’s football team in the time he owned it, but his son says now, referring to the owners in 1936, “Those guys, and particularly him, were always thinking about the league first.” “The draft was the greatest thing that ever happened to the NFL,” Bert Bell said in 1957. “Over the years, it brought balance to the league.” Bell lived long enough to appreciate the value of television coverage. Upton Bell says his father often told the league owners, “Our future is in TV.” Ten months before his death, the Baltimore Colts beat the New York Giants in sudden-death overtime in the nationally televised 1958 NFL Championship Game, later labeled “The Greatest Game Ever Played.” Upton Bell is not exactly impartial, but he thinks ESPN should make note at least once during its draft coverage of the fact that the whole thing would not have happened without his father. “Here’s the man who saved their bacon,” he says of his father. “Let me ask you this: Did they lose sight of Vince Lombardi?” ",Sport/Sport,‘The great American crapshoot’: How Bert Bell saved the NFL with the draft,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/25/the-great-american-crapshoot-how-bert-bell-saved-the-nfl-with-the-draft
