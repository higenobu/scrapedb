Fertitta’s general counsel sent a letter Dec. 1 notifying the SPAC of its intention to call off the merger due to delays, drawing a threat of legal action in response. Fast Acquisition shares advanced 1.2% to $10.18 as of 10:35 a.m. Friday in New York after gaining as much as 2.9%. Bonds issued by Golden Nugget were unchanged, according to Trace data. Fertitta, who also owns the Houston Rockets basketball team, announced in February that he planned to take his casino and restaurant operations public through the SPAC. In June, he expanded the deal to add additional businesses. Fast Acquisition, whose backers include Ruby Tuesday founder Sandy Beall, said it will continue to look for a combination with a new operating company and that the settlement will ensure the blank-check firm will remain sufficiently capitalized as it seeks a new target.
