5/4/2022,"It’s time to talk about what some folks would rather forget. The sign’s language was blunt. There was never any question about its message, or its target. The first word was a racist slur. Then: “Don’t Let the Sun Set on Your Head in This Town.” Originally, the “sundown sign” went up at the train station. Then, it was moved to the middle of the main street. It happened more than a century ago. In Texas. De Leon, Texas. It wasn’t the only sign like that in Texas. I’ve met people who claimed they personally saw signs in Bowie, Glen Rose and Grand Saline. Don’t get me wrong. I’m not picking on Texas or even the South. In a Web search, I found similar racist signs mentioned in towns in California, Washington, Nebraska and Indiana. One town in British Columbia even had a sign warning Chinese to stay out. But we know for sure that De Leon, 95 miles southwest of Fort Worth, had one of those signs for years. It went up more than a century ago, in 1886, in the bitter decade after Reconstruction. That was so long ago that the nice folks in that quiet peanut farming town might rather forget it. I happened to find it because two historians have written about it. The De Leon sign is actually part of a more shameful story in 19th-century Texas. White vigilantes threatened the Black residents of Comanche County and forced them to move out. In the 1880s, Comanche County was a growing cattle and cotton market. The towns of Comanche, De Leon and Gustine and the surrounding county were home to 8,608 people, including 79 Black residents. Those were troubled times in Texas, both for race relations and the justice system. According to The New Handbook of Texas, white lynch mobs had begun to undermine the entire justice system in 1885, abducting and killing 23 white men, 19 Black men and one white woman. The next year, what became known as “the Comanche County exodus” began with the killing of a white woman, Sallie Stephens. According to historian B.B. Lightfoot’s 1953 account in Southwestern Historical Quarterly, a Black suspect named Tom McNeal was lynched. After the sign went up at the De Leon train station, armed white vigilantes went door-to-door and told every Black resident to pack up and get out of Comanche County. One by one, every Black family moved away, mostly to Waco or Dallas. They abandoned family homes, churches, farms and the land of lifelong memories. By the 1890 census, the only Black residents were two orphaned children who lived with white families. Later, the Texas Central Railroad asked to move the De Leon sign. The train porters were being threatened. So it was moved to the town well in the middle of Texas Avenue between the peanut mill and a tractor dealer, according to an updated 1996 report in a local magazine, the Messenger. The earlier account deadpanned: “Because it has no Negro population, Comanche County is one of the few places in the South that has no apparent race problem.” Comanche County did not have one Black resident in 1940, according to the New Handbook. By 1970, the census counted two. The 2000 census found 62 Black residents in Comanche County, still fewer than in 1880. Neither report says when the De Leon sign was taken down.",U.S./Fort Worth Star-Telegram,"In a ‘sundown town’ in Texas, white vigilantes forced Black residents to leave home",https://news.yahoo.com/sundown-town-texas-white-vigilantes-214539094.html

Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) on Tuesday expressed their views on the draft Supreme Court opinion that was leaked Monday night and would overturn Roe v. Wade. ""Overturning Roe v. Wade endangers the health and wellbeing of women in Arizona and across America,"" Sinema wrote in a statement posted to Twitter. Despite her opposition to the court's decision, Sinema said she was unwilling to kill the Senate filibuster to force through legislation codifying abortion rights into federal law, The Hill reported. Statement on Draft Supreme Court Opinion pic.twitter.com/3GYIF3YnM7 — Kyrsten Sinema (@SenatorSinema) May 3, 2022 Manchin did not directly criticize the draft ruling, but he did echo Sinema by voicing support for the filibuster. Both Manchin and Sinema noted that the filibuster has been used in the past to protect ""women's rights."" Sens. Collins and Murkowski are both pro-choice, and both expressed disappointment with the leaked opinion. Murkowski said the idea of a decision to overturn Roe ""rocks my confidence in the court,"" while Collins said the draft ruling was ""completely inconsistent with what Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh said in their hearings and in our meetings in my office."" Both justices reportedly indicated to Collins that they considered Roe to be settled law. Neither GOP senator, however, is likely to vote to weaken the filibuster while Democrats are in the majority. Even if Democrats could remove the filibuster, they'd still be two votes short on codifying abortion access. Collins, Murkowski, Manchin, and Bob Casey (D-Penn.) all oppose the Democrats' Women's Health Protection Act. Texas Gov.

5/4/2022,"By Daniel Trotta May 3 (Reuters) - U.S. officials on Tuesday announced unprecedented measures to boost water levels at Lake Powell, an artificial reservoir on the Colorado River that is so low as to endanger the production of hydroelectric power for seven Western states. Amid a sustained drought exacerbated by climate change, the Bureau of Reclamation will release an additional 500,000 acre-feet (616.7 million cubic meters) of water this year from the Flaming Gorge Reservoir upstream on the Wyoming-Utah border that will flow into Lake Powell. Another 480,000 acre-feet that otherwise would have been released downstream will be retained in the artificial lake on the Utah-Arizona border, officials said. ""We have never taken this step before in the Colorado River Basin, but the conditions we see today and the potential risk we see on the horizon demand that we take prompt action,"" Tanya Trujillo, the Interior Department's assistant secretary for water and science, told reporters. One acre-foot, or 326,000 gallons (1.48 million liters), is enough water to supply one or two households for a year. The additional 980,000 acre-feet in Lake Powell, formed when the Colorado River was dammed in northern Arizona in the 1960s, will help keep the Glen Canyon Dam's hydroelectric production online, raising the reservoir's record low surface by 16 feet (4.88 meters), the bureau said. If Lake Powell, the second largest U.S. reservoir, were to drop another 32 feet, the 1,320-megawatt plant would be unable to generate electricity for millions of people in Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada and Nebraska. The western United States has experienced the driest period on record over the past two decades. Some experts say the term drought is inadequate because it suggests conditions will return to normal. ""We are never going to see these reservoirs filled again in our lifetime,"" said Denielle Perry, a professor at Northern Arizona University's School of Earth and Sustainability. The new measures will put more stress on Lake Mead, the country's largest reservoir, which is downstream from Lake Powell and also at a record low. Lake Mead, formed by Hoover Dam in the 1930s and crucial to the water supply of 25 million people, has fallen so low that a barrel containing human remains, believed to date to the 1980s, was found in the receding shoreline on Sunday.

5/4/2022,"The Kremlin deepened its unusual rift over World War II history with Israel on Tuesday morning by endorsing – and expanding on – falsehood-riddled comments made by Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov about the supposed collaboration of Jews during the Holocaust with their own Nazi killers. In a post titled “On Antisemitism” published on the Telegram social media network, Russia’s foreign ministry tried to tie support for Ukraine with Nazi collaborationism, arguing (incorrectly) that history “is unfortunately familiar with tragic examples of Jewish-Nazi collaboration.” It went on to accuse the current regime in Kyiv – headed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is Jewish – of precisely such complicity while reminding Israel that it was the Red Army “that stopped the Holocaust and the destruction of the Jewish world.” The post went so far as to suggest that Israel – which has hardly been Ukraine’s foremost supporter in the war effort – was too naive to see that after “canceling” Russians, Ukrainian leadership would inevitably move against the nation’s Jewish population. It was a remarkable turn of events, considering that when the war began, Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett sought to broker a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. Slow to help at first, Israel offered Ukraine material support late last month. If that support is more limited than that of European nations and the United States, that is largely because Israel’s precarious geopolitical status leaves little room to maneuver between allies and foes. Still, it is not entirely clear why the Kremlin has decided to litigate one of the most controversial and misunderstood aspects of World War II history as a means of persuading Israel – and, presumably, other nations – that it was right to invade Ukraine. Such an attempt may have been inevitable, given that Russia’s initial rationale for attacking its much smaller neighbor was a need to “de-Nazify” Ukrainian leadership. Lavrov offered his own thoughts on the matter on Sunday, telling an Italian outlet,“Wise Jewish people say that the most ardent antisemites are usually Jews.” He also repeated the debunked claim that Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler was partly Jewish. Having just commemorated the Holocaust the previous week, Israeli leadership vigorously denounced Lavrov’s remarks. “Foreign Minister Lavrov’s remarks are both an unforgivable and outrageous statement as well as a terrible historical error,” Lavrov’s counterpart, Israeli foreign minister Yair Lapid, wrote on Twitter. “Jews did not murder themselves in the Holocaust. The lowest level of racism against Jews is to accuse Jews themselves of antisemitism.” Despite the fact that there is little evidence that Lavrov’s argument – or any other justification for the Ukraine invasion – was finding traction, Russia’s foreign ministry decided to post a lengthy exposition on Telegram that called Lapid’s statement “anti-historical” and repeated Lavrov’s claim that European Jews were responsible for their own destruction. The Russian foreign ministry charged Zelensky with “consciously” abetting Ukrainian neo-Nazis, comparing him to Jewish leaders during World War II who may have been aware of some aspects of the Holocaust but said nothing. Zelensky, on the other hand, is helping neo-Nazis “quite voluntarily,” the Telegram post said. Claims about complicity with the Nazis fail to reflect what the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum calls “impossible moral dilemmas” faced by Jewish leaders in Eastern European ghettoes from which hundreds of thousands were deported to the death camps of Poland, where they were murdered. The Nazis kept their plans for the Holocaust under secrecy, telling Jews that they were merely being “resettled” in Poland. Rumors of the death camps did reach the ghettos where Jews were housed in inhumane conditions, but many refused to believe them. Even as the Russian foreign ministry proffered its arguments about Jewish-Nazi collaboration, it acknowledged – in the very same Telegram post – that any such collaboration on the part of Jewish leaders was, in the words of three leading Israeli historians, a “marginal phenomenon.”",World/Yahoo News,Russia lashes out at Israel as rift over Holocaust and Ukraine widens,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-lashes-out-at-israel-as-rift-over-holocaust-and-ukraine-widens-223208572.html
