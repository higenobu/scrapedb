5/8/2022,"A coalition of campaigners has urged the UK government not to betray working women by ditching its promises to clamp down on sexual harassment and workplace pregnancy discrimination in its flagship employment bill. Before the Queen’s speech on Tuesday, campaigners are calling on the government to push forward with the bill, which was promised in 2019 and promoted as the way to protect UK workers after Britain left the EU. Unions and campaigners have reacted with fury to reports that the bill has been shelved, saying the failure to act on promised protections risks “turning the clock back” for women at work. Frances O’Grady, the secretary general of the Trades Union Congress, said: “Everyone deserves to be treated fairly at work. But too many women are discriminated against because they are pregnant, pushed out of work because they have caring responsibilities and too many still experience sexual harassment at work. “If ministers don’t announce the employment bill in the Queen’s speech, they are abandoning working women.” The TUC, which called the shelving of the bill a betrayal of working people, has joined forces with the Fawcett Society, Maternity Action, and the Women’s Budget Group to push for its revival. The government had said its employment bill, promised before the UK formally left the EU as the central mechanism to safeguard workers’ rights, would make the country “the best place in the world to work” after Brexit. It promised to make employers responsible for preventing sexual harassment, as well as extending redundancy protections for pregnant women and making flexible working the default, unless employers had a good reason to refuse it. It also promised the right to a week’s leave for unpaid carers and paid leave for parents with children needing neonatal care. But Cabinet Office officials have stopped working on the bill, meaning it is unlikely to make the speech, the Financial Times reported, quoting three unnamed civil servants. The chair of Maternity Action, Heather Wakefield, said the employment bill had been the government’s only response to research in 2016 by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which found that that pregnancy and maternity discrimination was rife in Britain’s workplaces, with 390,000 women experiencing discrimination. “Abandoning that commitment now, by shelving the employment bill, would mean the government has wasted six years talking about – but not actually doing anything to tackle – such discrimination,” she said. Mary-Ann Stephenson, the director of the Women’s Budget Group, said the pandemic had revolutionised attitudes to flexible and hybrid working, yet the government had missed an opportunity to level the playing field for working mothers. “Failing to deliver this bill is failing to deliver for women,” she said. “Care is the root of much of the discrimination women face – this bill would have provided vital protections.” A spokesperson from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it could not comment on the content’s of the Queen’s speech. They said the government was committed to creating “a high-skilled, high-productivity, high-wage economy” to delivers on the “ambition to make the UK the best place in the world to work”, which included ensuring women’s rights in the workplace were protected.",News/Society,Tories urged not to betray working women by ditching employment bill,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/08/tories-urged-not-to-betray-working-women-by-ditching-employment-bill
5/8/2022,"Voters in the Philippines will go to the polls for a presidential election that pits frontrunner Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the son and namesake of the late dictator, against a human rights lawyer who has promised a transparent government. Marcos Jr, known as “Bongbong”, whose authoritarian father plundered billions of dollars from the state and presided over rife human rights abuses, has maintained a strong lead in opinion polls in the run-up to Monday’s vote. If elected president, it would mark an extraordinary rehabilitation of one of the country’s most controversial political families. Marcos is trailed in the polls by Leni Robredo, the current vice-president and a human rights lawyer who has advocated for marginalised groups. As vice president – a position elected separately from the president – she has frequently clashed with president Rodrigo Duterte, and has condemned his so-called “war on drugs’, which has killed as many as 30,000 people according to some estimates, and prompted an investigation by the international criminal court. Marcos, whose backers have used social media to rebrand the family and whitewash history, has a significant lead in opinion polls. He is the preferred candidate of 56% of voters, according to a recent survey by Pulse Asia. Robredo, behind him, is favoured by 23%. However, analysts say it is possible such surveys have overestimated Marcos’s lead, pointing to the large turnouts at Robredo’s rallies. “The reality could be that it is a very close race,” said Ronald Mendoza, the dean of Manila’s Ateneo school of government. “Hopefully [the result] will be settled sooner because that lends itself to a more stable transition.” The Philippine police and military said on Sunday they were on high alert ahead of the vote. “We are ready for any contingencies,” the armed forces chief, Lt Genl Andres Centino, told a media briefing. “We are committed … to ensure that we have a secure, accurate, free and fair elections tomorrow,” he said. On Saturday, the last day of campaigning, Robredo supporters filled the streets of Makati, in the national capital region, with a sea of bright pink, the campaign’s trademark colour. “We have the right to a future with dignity, and we have the duty to fight for it. We have learned that nothing is impossible,” Robredo told crowds of supporters. Robredo is up against two of the country’s most powerful political families: the Marcoses, and the Dutertes. The president’s daughter, Sara Duterte, is running alongside Marcos Jr for the vice-presidency, though Duterte has not endorsed a presidential candidate. The Marcos camp has shunned TV debates and avoided questions from media outlets it deems unfriendly. Instead, the family and its backers have used social media to reach voters, especially those who do not remember martial law, a time when thousands were killed, tortured and arrested. A network of accounts portray the Marcos period as a time when the country was prosperous and order, inundating news feeds with false claims about the period. Marcos Jr has denied the presence of any coordinated online campaign. Robredo’s camp, by contrast, has been driven by volunteer activists who have gone house to house trying to win over undecided voters. It is a strategy that is not usually applied on such a wide scale in presidential elections in the Philippines, and its impact is unclear, say analysts. “It’s something of a puzzle for us political scientists and observers of elections, whether this new thing in this campaign – that voluntarism, the house-to-house campaigns will matter in the final results of the elections,” said Prof Maria Ela L Atienza, who teaches political science at the University of the Philippines. Social media may give the impression that people have a strongly held preference, but this isn’t necessarily reflective of society, she added. “When we look back to previous elections, there was a huge percentage of people in the exit poll saying that they only decided weeks before the election, or even during the actual day of the elections,” she said. People are swayed not by loyalty to a political party, but by other personal factors, including the extent to which they feel a connection with candidates.Marcos, whose slogan is “together we shall rise again”, has campaigned with a message of unity and hope. At his final rally on Saturday, he told supporters: “We will reach the day that when we join forces, when we again face the world and shout to our friends and wave our flag, we will be proud to say we are Filipinos.” Atienza said the level of engagement among supporters of candidates is comparable to 1986, when Marcos Sr called snap elections – an attempt to prove his mandate amid growing pressure at home and abroad. His claim to have won, amid reports of cheating and fraud, led to the People Power Revolution, which overthrew his rule. It put the Philippines on “the imperfect road to democracy”, said Atienza. The small gains since then could be threatened by the prospect of another Marcos presidency, she added.",News/World news,Philippines faces stark election choice – dictator’s son or human rights lawyer?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/08/philippines-election-voters-marcos-jr-dictator-son-leni-robredo-human-rights
5/8/2022,"Deep in the basement of the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, and a very long way from Vladimir Putin’s lavish office in Moscow, Dmitry Bivol seemed the very opposite of his glowering and gloating president late on Saturday night. The 31-year-old Russian had just dominated Saúl “Canelo” Álvarez, the celebrated king of boxing, in a clinical and comprehensive performance. Bivol retained his WBA world light-heavyweight title as he proved he was too big, too strong and too composed for Álvarez, who had moved up from the super-middleweights where he had established himself as that division’s first undisputed champion in history. It was unsettling to imagine how Putin, a combat sports fan, might try to distort Bivol’s impressive victory into a glorious Russian triumph amid the carnage of war in Ukraine. Yet Bivol remained admirably restrained. When asked if he had replaced Canelo as the new world No 1 in the pound-for-pound rankings he smiled: “No. In my mind I just beat the guy who wanted my belt. He was a super-middleweight. Yes, he had a belt before at light-heavyweight [when Canelo beat Sergey Kovalev, another Russian, in 2019] but I don’t feel like I am the king today. I’m just better than Canelo today. I don’t even feel I am the best in the light-heavyweight division because I don’t have all the belts. I’m just one of the best.” This sounded like the pleasing antithesis of Putin-speak. Bivol was just as modest when it was suggested that it might have seemed disrespectful to him that, despite being the champion, he had to walk to the ring first. The fame of Canelo runs so deep that Bivol, in a mockery of boxing tradition, was introduced before him. The Russian anthem, thankfully, was not played alongside those of Mexico and the United States. Did Bivol use these apparent slights as additional motivation? He shook his head. “I understand. I walked [first] because Canelo is the biggest name and all the rules are for him. No problem. Just give me the fight. His name was first on the poster too. No problem. Just give me the fight. I know how people love Canelo, and it’s normal. He’s really the biggest fighter in the world. He’s a champion in four weight classes. Of course all people are on his side.” Bivol wanted to dedicate his win to “all people from a small, small city who want to achieve a lot – it’s possible”. It was a reminder of a conversation earlier in the week when he explained that his parents had given him a layered identity. His father is from Moldova while his mother, who is of Korean descent, was born in Kazakhstan. “Then her family moved to Kyrgyzstan,” Bivol said. “One day, when they graduated, my parents met in Russia. They married and moved to my mother’s home in Kyrgyzstan. I was born in Kyrgyzstan and lived there 11 years.” While he spoke Russian to his parents Bivol regarded Kyrgyzstan as home. “It’s a great country, It’s not a rich country but it has great people, nice people. It’s my motherland. I love Kyrgyzstan. I love the culture and it’s different to Russia.” Bivol conceded that war in Ukraine saddened him but he avoided criticising Putin by claiming that, as a sportsman, he was not qualified to comment on political issues. Such a circumspect attitude is understandable – especially as his parents, his wife and his children remain in St Petersburg. Bivol spends around 70% of the year with them. “My family are in Russia now and I didn’t speak to them yet,” he said on Saturday. “My wife doesn’t watch my fights, my mother doesn’t watch my fights – ever. I don’t want them to see me fight. After the fight is over they can watch it.” That attitude is rooted in the fact that Bivol’s close friend Maxim Dadashev, another Russian boxer, died four days after slipping into a coma following a brutal defeat in an American ring in July 2019. Those memories had framed our interview but Bivol looked a very different man after dazzling Canelo. “There were too many serious things in my head,” he said of his quiet intensity throughout fight week. Bivol needed to be serious and concentrated in the ring because he praised Canelo as a great champion. “I felt his power. He has really good speed, good power,” Bivol said before reminding us that Canelo is smaller than most light-heavyweights. Canelo had accepted the verdict in the ring but, later, he claimed to have won the bout. It was a typical reaction from a proud Mexican fighter – as was his insistence that he will instigate the rematch clause. Bivol’s response was more endearing. Asked how he might approach the rematch he shrugged. “I don’t know. I don’t have a rematch yet. I don’t even know what I will eat today or do tomorrow.” Most observers at ringside had Bivol winning widely – either by 118-110 or 117-111. But all three judges returned the barely credible scorecard of 115-113. Did he feel the officials had been trying to rob him? “I was a little bit shocked when I heard 115-113. I thought: ‘Maybe I lost today,’ I thought I won but everything was against me today. Then, at the end, even Eddie Hearn [the promoter] was congratulating me. He was smiling, he was happy for me – but not too much.” Bivol cracked up again. Hearn had helped drive the $160m deal which Canelo received for three fights meant to happen this year. Bivol was his first opponent – with the second bout slated for September against Canelo’s bitter rival Gennady Golovkin at super-middleweight. Hearn, who had Bivol winning by three rounds, stressed that the Golovkin fight will almost certainly not happen. “Canelo against Dmitri Bivol II is the biggest fight in boxing right now,” he said. The champion smiled cheerfully. He will fly back to St Petersburg on Monday. Hopefully Bivol will retain his charming humility and shy away from any attempt by Putin, or the president’s fervent supporters, to turn his outstanding bravery and skill into a celebration of Russian aggression and expansion. Bivol, in his own diffident way, will be happier in the company of his family and a heritage rooted in Kazakhstan, Moldova, Korea and Kyrgyzstan.",Sport/Sport,Dmitry Bivol: ‘I don’t feel like I am king today – just better than Canelo’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/08/dmitry-bivol-i-dont-feel-like-i-am-king-today-just-better-than-canelo
5/8/2022,"From seemingly being on the brink of U2-esque stadium success with 2010’s Grammy-winning The Suburbs, Arcade Fire rather lost their way with their next two albums. The Bowie-indebted, James Murphy-produced Reflektor was overlong and bloated. The highlights of 2017’s Everything Now, meanwhile, were too often compromised by heavy-handed satire. We feels like a step back from the brink. For a start, there’s no extraneous fat in its seven-track, 40-minute running time, each song earning its place, nothing outstaying its welcome. It’s very much a record of two halves, with side 1 insular and claustrophobic in mood, the four-part End of the Empire a particularly compelling blend of bleakness and beauty. Side 2 is far warmer, at times even joyous. The Lightning I, II has a sublime gear change midway through and suddenly echoes the motorik Springsteenisms of the War on Drugs, all shot through with the air of euphoria that defined Arcade Fire’s early records. The hushed title track is as minimalist as they get, and owes much of its tune to Big Thief’s sublime Cattails. Meanwhile, Unconditional II (Race and Religion), featuring a low-key Peter Gabriel guest spot, combines a Régine Chassagne vocal with 80s synthpop backing to fine, if slightly incongruous, effect.

You starred in It’s a Sin in 2021 – what was it like to work on a show that had such a huge cultural impact?It was mind-boggling.

5/8/2022,"“This book came out of years spent learning to be a writer, a process that will never be complete,” Maggie Shipstead writes in the acknowledgments of her first story collection, You Have a Friend in 10A. It may sound over-earnest – indeed, the whole section does – but with Shipstead there’s always a sharp layer of self-awareness just beneath the surface. In this case, it works as a knowing wink to the reader, since the second story in the book, Acknowledgements, is narrated by a solipsistic young male writer as he considers how best to use his novel’s acknowledgments to air long-held grievances against former mentors and women who’ve turned him down. Shipstead’s third novel, the extraordinary historical epic Great Circle, was shortlisted last month for the Women’s prize, following on from her Booker shortlisting and giving the impression that she is something of an overnight success. But the stories in You Have a Friend in 10A chart the evolution over more than a decade of her unnerving ability to capture a character’s inner life in a few choice phrases and to pinpoint the unique collision of personality flaws that will trigger the story’s drama. In the most haunting piece here, Souterrain, she reverses cause and effect, moving backwards between present-day and wartime Paris to show how a careless remark or a small lie can have fatal consequences, the ripples of guilt and shame spreading through generations. Many of the stories centre on sexual power dynamics, notably between younger women and older men. Shipstead anatomises these relationships with a cynical eye, highlighting their transactional nature. In Backcountry, a young woman recoils from an encounter with her lover’s abandoned ex-wife: “Ingrid resolved never to be so powerless. It did not occur to her that such resolutions are in vain, that the potential for destruction is built into love as fundamentally as into atoms of uranium.” It’s a rare writer who can create a world as convincingly over a few pages as in a 600-page novel; Shipstead’s fluency in both forms is testament to the skill she modestly casts as a work in progress.

5/8/2022,"It’s hard to find words for how terrible that second leaders’ debate was. A genuine shit blizzard. It was the Jerry Springer of leaders’ debates. Many people watching the 2022 federal election have been in various agonies about the coarsening of our politics, and the screaming superficiality of election coverage – and those two mega trends converged in a studio on the Nine Network on Sunday night. The debate was in a completely ridiculous format. God knows why either side agreed to it. There was precious little moderation, which meant there were lengthy periods of indecipherable hectoring between two blokes in blue suits. I’m obsessed with politics, and will consume it in all its forms. But Sunday night was tedious. Unless you crave a bit of biff, or a bout of freestyle jelly wrestling, I’m also confident the dialogue between Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese would have been completely incomprehensible for any voter looking for information ahead of the opening of prepoll voting on Monday. How on earth could the viewing audience keep up with such explosive incomprehension? Any time either of the two leaders became in any way adjacent to a coherent thought or a sliver of insight that might have been helpful to a low-information voter, they were either gonged off or shouted at by their opponent. Morrison rarely stumbles over words and messages but the prime minister, held captive by the absurd format, was about as coherent and clear as a person trying to deliver a monologue while falling down a flight of stairs. Possibly the prime minister was off his game because of the publication of two opinion polls just before the debate started that suggest the Coalition is looking at an electoral rout on 21 May, but there were periods in the debate when Morrison looked as though he might just pick up the lectern and throw it across the room. There were other moments when it seemed just possible that a practised smirk Morrison adopts in these formats to mask his existential psychic distress could escalate into hysterical laughter at the abject futility of his Sunday evening. For his part, Anthony Albanese tried to get a grip on something. Anything really. A glass of water. His opponent. Clarity. Sense. Punctuation. A rescue helicopter. I think the Labor leader just gave up in the end, because what other option was there? Albanese’s brain processes far too slowly to be glib in 60-second slivers. Morrison is a glib grand master, but neither of these two knew they were entering the glib Olympics, so neither of them had conditioned to hit peak performance. Not content with dishing up a public affairs atrocity badged as an election debate, Nine then purported to deliver an after-match viewer verdict, via a QR code, that gave the debate wash-up the atmospherics of a late-night binge on the shopping channel. Because I didn’t try the QR code myself, I’m unclear whether viewers got a set of steak knifes or a magnum of eau de toilette with their vote. To save my sanity I had muted by then – but as I glanced up periodically at my television I could see the figures kept changing, which seemed on brand with the whole production. Win, lose, draw – does any of it matter? Were there any highlights? Insights? I think Morrison said sorry for something. This might have felt weighty in other circumstances given he doesn’t say it very often. I think Albanese yelled “that’s an outrageous slur” a couple of times. I’m not sure what that was about and I’m close to 100% confident that it doesn’t matter. Apart from the apology, I think Morrison blamed either international factors or Albanese for most things. There was a particularly surreal exchange about the federal integrity commission when the prime minister (who had pointblank refused to introduce legislation giving effect to his own election promise) berated his opponent for not having any legislation from opposition, when Morrison (still in government, last I looked) could have put his own legislation in the parliament for a vote. I believe Morrison also accused Albanese of hiding in the bushes. It wasn’t clear which bushes. I suspect but do not know they were metaphorical bushes. Albanese was asked what he’d do for young people and words followed. My recollection is not great words. This could be funny, of course, and perhaps if I wasn’t so worried about the state of democratic discourse and the media’s role in safeguarding it I might have laughed. But I don’t think laughing is the right response. It’s hard to know what the two leaders will have made of it. Probably neither will give it much thought, because something so pointless can’t possibly be material. But if I were them, with the vote for independents and micro-parties threatening to reach new highs in this contest, I’d be pretty annoyed at being thrust into televisual End Times on the night before prepoll opens. If I had any aspiration to lead the country, I’d want my time to be worth something, and I’d also want an opportunity to confirm something other than people’s worst instincts about major-party politics.",News/Australia news,Pity Australia’s voters: awful leaders’ debate cursed by absurd format and incoherent hectoring | Katharine Murphy,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2022/may/08/pity-australias-voters-awful-leaders-debate-cursed-by-absurd-format-and-incoherent-hectoring
5/8/2022,"Arsenal knew what they had to do in the final game of the season: win against West Ham and hope Chelsea slipped up against Manchester United. They did the former with two goals and a clean sheet, overcoming a steely defensive performance from the hosts in the first half. The latter, however, is where their hopes were dashed. Chelsea, who went behind twice, scored four goals to secure a final home victory and consecutive Women’s Super League titles. Though the Gunners have every right to be heartbroken, this performance, full of zip and vigour, represented everything that has gone right for Jonas Eidevall and his side this season. In the first half West Ham restricted Arsenal from operating centrally, forcing Beth Mead and her teammates to the flanks with a high-pressing 3-5-2 system. Where the defenders Leah Williamson and Lotte Wubben-Moy would usually have time to spray the ball across the field and instigate counterattacks, this time they were either occupied by Kate Longhurst or Hawa Cissoko, or busy breaking up counters. Eidevall seemed to spot that particular trick, shouting at his players from the managerial box to “defend short” – in other words, keep the ball in dangerous areas to help create chances and continue to cultivate the pressure. The best opportunity to do so was on the Arsenal right, which Mead was galloping down to provide her side with some creative joy, having scored in her past three away games in the league. She zipped crosses into the box, often finding Vivianne Miedema and Caitlin Foord; both had a few pops at goal but were smothered by one of the West Ham back three on every occasion. The home defenders were being kept on their toes and responding well, but there were gaps opening up that Foord and Miedema were bursting into with increasing frequency. All evidence seemed to point to a forthcoming goal for Arsenal, and the attack needed no more encouragement than the injured Jordan Nobbs, jumping up and down on the sidelines every time she got wind of another goal update in the game between Chelsea and Manchester United. Despite Arsenal’s growing supremacy, however, West Ham managed to escape the first half unscathed. After the break Arsenal brought on Stina Blackstenius for Foord, forcing West Ham deeper into their own box. It was a sensational move on Eidevall’s part as Blackstenius got to work. Her first move was to break the deadlock in the 61st minute, with a powerful drive into the box followed up by a low shot past Mackenzie Arnold. Sign up for our new and free women’s football newsletter! Five minutes later she was in the mix again, this time playing the supporting role to Steph Catley, who thundered the ball into the net with her left foot after picking up possession at the corner of the penalty box. West Ham’s midfield was no longer able to keep up with Arsenal’s ferocity. But the goals mattered little as Chelsea steadily regained the dominant position in their game. At the final whistle, Arsenal, who had never previously finished second in the league had no choice but to give up the ghost.

5/8/2022,"Picnics have been banned and bins fenced off in a large swathe of northern Rome as health authorities move to contain the wild boar population after African swine fever was detected in a deceased animal. Feeding or approaching the animals has also been forbidden, while people who have walked through farmland or nature reserves in the affected areas have been told to disinfect their shoes. African swine fever, which is fatal to pigs and wild boar but harmless to humans, was detected in the body of a dead boar in the Insugherata nature reserve on Thursday. It was the first time a case had been reported in the centre of Italy after the disease was found in wild boar in the northern Piedmont region in January, prompting the government to appoint a special commissioner to impose measures to eradicate the illness. The affected anti-boar “red zones” in Rome are located in the north and north-west of the Italian capital, including an area close to Vatican City. About 23,000 wild boar live in and around Rome, according to estimates from Coldiretti, the farmers’ association. The animals are often seen in parks, walking down the road or searching for food in overflowing rubbish bins, mostly in districts in the north of the city. Residents in several neighbourhoods last week imposed a nightly “curfew” after a spate of attacks by wild boar. One woman suffered minor injuries after being pushed to the ground by animal she encountered as she put out the rubbish. The Italian health minister, Roberto Speranza, said the situation would receive “maximum attention”. Andrea Costa, a health ministry undersecretary, said the government was also discussing a “slaughtering plan” to reduce the wild boar population. “I respect the sensitivities of animal rights activists and environmentalists, but we are facing an emergency and it must be addressed with emergency measures,” he told the state broadcaster, Rai.",News/World news,Picnics banned in Rome in effort to combat wild boar incursions,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/08/picnics-banned-in-rome-in-bid-to-combat-wild-boar-incursions
