12/24/2021,"Trump was silent for more than three hours after his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6. The Jan. 6 committee is trying to understand why Trump took so long to speak to his supporters. Rep. Bennie Thompson said Trump had to retape his video telling them to leave as he wouldn't say the ""right thing."" Then-President Donald Trump had to keep reshooting a video during the Capitol riot because he couldn't say the ""right thing"" to tell his supporters to go home, the chair of the January 6 committee said. ""It appears that he tried to do a taping several times, but he wouldn't say the right thing,"" committee chair Rep. Bennie Thompson told The Washington Post, citing witness interviews and media reports. Trump had stayed publicly silent for 187 minutes after his supporters breached the Capitol in January 6. The committee investigating the riot is trying to understand why the former president took so long to speak as it weighs recommending criminal charges against him. Thompson's comments follow increasing speculation that Trump's behavior during the riot could mean he illegally obstructed Congress. Rep. Liz Cheney, vice chair of the January 6 committee, previously suggested the committee could find Trump guilty of criminal obstruction. In the video he eventually put out on January 6, Trump told his supporters at the Capitol to home, and called the mob ""very special people."" Thompson told The Post that the fact Trump had to keep retaking the video was of interest to the committee because it could help explain why he took so long to speak. The reasons for Trump's delayed response are significant because it could help the committee decide whether to make a criminal referral against Trump, Thompson said. In that case, Congress would inform the Justice Department that it believed a crime was committed, and federal prosecutors would decide whether to bring charges against Trump. ""One of those concerns is that whether or not it was intentional, and whether or not that lack of attention for that longer period of time, would warrant a referral,"" he said. Representatives for Trump did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

12/24/2021,"The Omicron variant of COVID-19 has surged worldwide in record time—it was only three weeks ago that the first case was identified in South Africa. Last week, it accounted for 73% of new COVID infections in the United States, according to the latest CDC data. It's highly contagious—scientists estimate it's twice as transmissible as the Delta variant, which itself was twice as transmissible as the original COIVD strain—which calls for an abundance of caution. How do you know if you've been infected with Omicron, how severe is it, and what should you do? Read on to find out more—and to ensure your health and the health of others, don't miss these Sure Signs You've Already Had COVID.   Dr. Katherine Poehling, a member of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, told NBC News on Wednesday that the prominent symptoms of an Omicron infection are: Cough Fatigue or tiredness Congestion and runny nose Unlike previous variants, loss of taste and smell seems to be uncommon, she said.   According to South Africa's biggest private health insurer, South Africans with an Omicron infection often develop scratchy or sore throat nasal congestion dry cough muscle pain, especially low back pain How severe do the symptoms tend to be? Read on.   Experts tentatively say that Omicron seems to be producing milder symptoms than previous variants. ""It is clear that if you're vaccinated, particularly if you've had a booster, Omicron tends to produce milder infections,"" Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center,"" told NBC. ""What we haven't seen yet is a substantial body of information about what Omicron will do in unvaccinated people,"" he added. RELATED: Warning Signs You Have ""Too Much Fat,"" Say Experts    But experts warn that more data needs to be gathered before it can be conclusively said that Omicron causes different symptoms. ""It's still too early to say that there's any difference in symptoms between the Omicron variant and previous versions,"" Ashley Z. Ritter, an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania told the New York Times on Wednesday.    Early data indicates that Omicron's incubation period—the time it takes for an infected person to develop symptoms after exposure to the virus—may be significantly shorter than with previous variants: Previously, it was about a week, while Omicron may develop in three days or less. RELATED: Things to Never Do After Age 40, Say Health Experts    According to the CDC, the most common symptoms of COVID-19 include: Fever or chills Cough Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Fatigue Muscle or body aches Headache New loss of taste or smell Sore throat Congestion or runny nose Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea    So how do you tell if your cough or sore throat is a cold or COVID? You really can't, experts say. Their advice: If you're having any symptoms that are out of the ordinary, get tested for COVID ASAP—even if you've been fully vaccinated or boosted—and self-isolate until you know the results. ""Even if you think it's just allergies, it would be best for you to go ahead and get a COVID test and make sure you don't have it before you go to work or school or church, because those symptoms can be very mild,"" said S. Wesley Long, medical director of diagnostic microbiology at Houston Methodist hospital, this week. If you test positive for COVID, the CDC advises that you isolate for 10 days after the date any symptoms started (as long as your symptoms are improving and you've been fever-free for at least 24 hours without using any fever-reducing medications). If you test positive but don't have symptoms, you should isolate for 10 days from the date of your COVID test.  RELATED: This Makes You ""Most Likely"" to Die of COVID, Says Experts    Follow the fundamentals and help end this pandemic, no matter where you live—get vaccinated ASAP; if you live in an area with low vaccination rates, wear an N95 face mask, don't travel, social distance, avoid large crowds, don't go indoors with people you're not sheltering with (especially in bars), practice good hand hygiene, and to protect your life and the lives of others, don't visit any of these 35 Places You're Most Likely to Catch COVID.","Health/Eat This, Not That!",Omicron Symptoms Usually Appear Like This,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/omicron-symptoms-usually-appear-121546819.html
12/24/2021,"(Reuters) - War games conducted this week by Iran in the Gulf were intended to send a warning to Israel, the country's top military commanders said on Friday, amid concerns over possible Israeli plans to target Iranian nuclear sites. The Revolutionary Guards' war games, which included firing ballistic and cruise missiles, ended on Friday. ""These exercises had a very clear message: a serious, real ... warning to threats by the Zionist regime's authorities to beware of their mistakes,"" Guards chief General Hossein Salami said on state TV. ""We will cut off their hands if they make a wrong move... The distance between actual operations and military exercises is only a change in the angles of launching the missiles,"" Salami added. Armed Forces Chief of Staff Major General Mohammad Bagheri said 16 ballistic missiles of different classes had been fired simultaneously and had destroyed predetermined targets. Iran says its ballistic missiles have a range of 2,000 km (1,200 miles) and are capable of reaching Israel and U.S. bases in the region. Israel, which opposes efforts by world powers to revive Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal, has long threatened military action if diplomacy fails. Iran says its nuclear ambitions are peaceful. Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz has called on world powers not to allow Iran to play for time at the nuclear negotiations, in recess at Iran's request and scheduled to resume next Monday. Israel is widely believed to be the only Middle Eastern country with a nuclear arsenal.
