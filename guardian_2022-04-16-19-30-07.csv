4/16/2022,"Tucked among tall redwood trees in a remote part of northern California, four young California condors await their chance to take to the skies. The fluffy juveniles – housed in a facility where they playfully peck at each other and jump between perches – will help usher in a new era. Referred to as prey-go-neesh by the Yurok people who called this land home, the sacred scavengers are the first group to be reintroduced to their native range since they disappeared from the region more than a century ago. “For countless generations, the Yurok people have upheld a sacred responsibility to maintain balance in the natural world,” said Joseph L James, the chairman of the Yurok Tribe. “Condor reintroduction is a real-life manifestation of our cultural commitment to restore and protect the planet for future generations.” The California condor, the largest flying bird in North America, with a wingspan that stretches between nine and 10 feet, was one of the first animals listed as endangered. Once abundant in the skies over northern California, the birds were pushed to the brink of extinction by white settlers who arrived during the Gold Rush. They have not been seen in northern California since 1892. By the 1980s there were fewer than two dozen left in the wild, and the few remaining were taken into captivity for their protection. Since then, roughly 300 have been reintroduced to the wild, but this is the first time they will be released in northern California. If successful, the plan would help return this majestic ecosystem to its former glory and cement the partnership between the Yurok Tribe and state and federal agencies who are working to restore it. After decades of planning, the release could be just weeks away. The process is lengthy and deliberate, a carefully considered strategy to ensure the young birds survive in the wild. The work began in 2008, when the tribe received a federal grant to conduct a feasibility study on whether the condors could still live in their historic but rapidly changing range. Once it was clear they could survive, the tribe designed and built the condor release management facility on park land. The remote site includes all the young birds need to acclimate as they take small steps toward freedom. There’s a simulated power pole, two small pools, and a perch with a view of the tall redwood trees that line the ridge. Two high-definition cameras provide handlers and the public a glimpse at them through a live feed, and the custom-welded shipping containers they are housed in provide a fire-resistant observation station where birds can receive check-ups and care. The three baby birds – 3 males and 1 female, all between the ages of two and three years old – are now nearly ready to be released. Set against 40 miles of craggy coastline, the region where they will be released was once abundant with life. The old-growth redwoods and prairie systems supported thriving salmon runs traversed by elk, bears, deer, and mountain lions. The discovery of gold in the 1800s drew settlers to the area who felled trees, developed the landscape, and massacred the Indigenous people who lived on and cared for the land. The legacy of those atrocities lives on. Even as the Yurok people and park officials work together to bring balance back to the lands, roughly two-thirds of the park is in peril, damaged by logging and industry. The birds could face threats from toxic contaminants, including lead poisoning from ammunition left behind in game, pesticides from nearby agricultural hubs, and DMT that has lingered in the environment long after it was outlawed. The climate crisis will also spur new dangers from fire and drought. But those who have worked adamantly to bring the condors home have been careful to consider the risks and are confident the condors will thrive. “We always look back to help guide our future,” the tribe’s vice-chair, Frankie Myers, said, speaking to a small group of reporters gathered in the snow outside the facility. “We look back to our elders, to people who came before us, to help guide us. We believe this is the goal they wanted us to achieve.” In the wild, fledglings are followed by their parents as they learn to fly and survive on their own. These birds don’t have their parents to show them the ropes, but an older mentor, a male of nearly eight, has been housed with the juveniles to teach them. The young condors also learn by watching turkey vultures and ravens, fellow scavengers they will interact with around carcasses, as they navigate the terrain. Bait has been left outside the pen and the juveniles can already view the other birds feasting nearby. When the condors are ready, they will be released directly into a feeding event. “This allows them to dominate the turkey vultures – which is a really good thing – and they get a food reward,” said Chris West, manager of the Yurok Condor Restoration Program. “A lot of condors’ social life happens around carcasses,” he added. “It is like sitting around the dinner table and chatting with family and friends.” Two condors will be released together first; then the last two, one at a time. The mentor will remain in the pen, luring the newly freed birds back to socialize and eat, and giving program workers the chance to monitor or recapture them if problems arise. Even after they are released, they will be heavily monitored. Each bird will be equipped with a radio transmitter and cellular satellite hybrid transmitter units that will deliver key GPS data. It will also emit mortality signals if the condor stops moving. Workers will then be able to find the birds and render aid if they are injured or sick, or retrieve deceased condors for necropsy and analysis to better understand why they perished. Twice a year the condors will be recaptured for a check-up. Blood tests will be conducted to check for lead or other toxins and their transmitters will be replaced. Program leaders said keeping close watch on the condors is an important part of ensuring success. Condors are slow breeders and don’t mate until they reach maturity at around eight years old. Females only produce a single egg every two years. Growing their wild population will be slow, but it will be supplemented with between four and six condors expected to be released every year for the next two decades. There’s hope that, by the end of the 20-year program, more than a hundred birds could call the region home. Even with strong oversight, risks remain. Lead bullets left in game continue to be a top killer of condors in the wild, an issue Yurok leaders are working directly with hunters to solve. Rising temperatures, an intensifying drought, and wildfires also pose a mortal threat. Condors in other parts of the state have already lost their lives to fire, including the 2020 Dolan fire in Big Sur. But along with bringing lost species back to the land, officials and tribal leaders are hoping to build in resilience and balance. This release and the future of California condors in this region is about more than just conservation. Moving forward, those involved in the project say the collaboration between the tribe and US government officials, including those at California state parks and the US Fish and Wildlife Service, is indicative of a new era of collaboration and common purpose. “We are listening to the original people and following their lead in how we manage the park to restore this very damaged landscape,” said Superintendent Steven Mietz of Redwood national park. “As we heal this landscape and bring back the condors, and we start to restore the previous majestic glory of the redwood forest, we are also healing the relationship with each other and we are healing our relationship with the original Indigenous people.” Healing the land will also help heal the people who once called it home. “As a people, we will not recover from the traumas of the last century until we fix our environment,” Myers, the Yurok Tribe’s vice-chairman, said. “Our culture, our ceremonies, our wellbeing and our identity are inextricably linked to the landscape.”",News/US news,‘A sacred responsibility’: Yurok Tribe poised to return condors to the skies,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/16/california-condors-yurok-tribe
4/16/2022,"The Japanese tsubo-niwa, or courtyard garden, became popular in the early Edo period (an era akin to our English Renaissance) of town planning. It was a little outdoor space – often not more than a corridor within the wings of a building – that became a hidden gem inside the home. A garden for looking on rather than being in, a place of contemplation. The best tsubo gardens are poised, breathtakingly beautiful spaces. The tsubo garden has strict rules about the layering of elements: water, plants, sky and stone, all influenced by the constraints of space: these are small gardens. Some of the most striking examples are reduced to the essentials: a single clump of bamboo, a water basin, a rock. Every now and again this idea pops up in contemporary, western spaces, often in large corporate buildings. But many of our homes have corners not too dissimilar: side returns, slivers of front garden, basement entrances and courtyards that all could welcome a design flourish. I’m not suggesting stone lanterns and water lavers, as these are likely to sit at odds with our architectural vernacular of bricks and mortar, but a more edited space – a single, beautiful specimen in an elegant pot that demands a little contemplation when you catch it – is no bad thing. Many architectural foliage plants can hold their own in such spaces and won’t mind the shade that often comes with such a corner. Cryptomeria japonica “Globosa Nana” is a dwarf version of a Japanese conifer that is very slow-growing, so doesn’t mind life in a large pot. It forms a dense, round, shaggy, almost fluffy shape that is immensely pleasing. In spring it is vibrant yellow-green and by winter has turned blue-green. A more seasonal interest is Mahonia eurybracteata subsp. ganpinensis “Soft Caress”. It is the aristocrat of the mahonias, with soft, fern-like evergreen foliage in bright green, followed by fragrant yellow flowers in late summer and dark purple berries in autumn. It is hardy, unfussy about shade and rarely requires pruning. If you want to screen something off – perhaps a neighbour’s kitchen extension that overlooks your garden – and you have only a narrow space to plant, invest in a Temple bamboo, Semiarundinaria fastuosa. The canes grow up to five metres tall, but its habit is very upright and narrow. This is a clump-forming bamboo and easy enough to keep in its space by rhizome pruning, but it is not fast growing. It will tolerate semi-shade, but in the sun the leaves will flush purple with age. It is also very tolerant of maritime climates and windy sites. The form “Viridis” keeps its green stems all year round.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Short on space?

4/16/2022,"Hussein Mohamud Hussein came to the UK in 1999, aged nine. His parents had sent him to live with his uncle, to escape the conflict in Somalia. But away from his parents, Hussein struggled to adjust to life in Lambeth, south London. Sometimes he’d argue with his uncle and sleep on night buses or on the street. “I was a nuisance in school,” he says. “Causing trouble. Not concentrating. A lot of teachers wanted to get rid of me.” One day, the deputy head, Mr Wilbourn, pulled him into his office. “He said,” Hussein remembers, “‘What’s the matter, buddy?’ I told him: ‘Imagine being in a place where you don’t have your mum and dad and no one understands you’.” Wilbourn knew Hussein’s ambition was to be a professional footballer, and would sometimes give the boy his season ticket to Tottenham Hotspur. “He kept me going along with my dream,” says Hussein. “I hope wherever he is now, he’s blessed and safe.” If football were a person, says Hussein, now 32, “I couldn’t thank them enough. It saved me. It stopped me from going to jail.” As a teen, Hussein joined a Somali-run club in Streatham called Waaberi FC, which helped keep him out of trouble, but in 2009 the club disbanded for lack of funding. “About 30 of us,” says Hussein, “had nothing to do. We started hanging around in alleyways smoking, stuff like that.” Some of his friends went to jail. A few even died. Although Hussein stayed away from criminal activity – he was by now working as a delivery driver – the experience made him “realise the importance of participating in sport and youth programmes”. In around 2014-15, there was an influx of east African migrants into his community. “I saw all these youngsters coming in,” says Hussein, “but there was nothing in place for them.” He set up Streatham FC, a community football team, and found players with help from a community leader. “It’s prevention through football,” says Hussein. “Preventing young people going on to the streets and into gang culture.” Hussein trains children between six and 19 – initially just boys, but now all are welcome. About 80% of the kids are from single-parent, low-income households. They are meant to pay £20 a month for kit and equipment, but few families can afford that. About 70 kids play regularly; in the summer, this can easily double. Last summer, the club ran a football programme for 2,035 kids – with help from council funding. (Streatham FC also takes donations.) Hussein lives on the club subscriptions, which barely cover the hours he works, topped up by benefits. “When I started this,” he says, “I was much better off. But I am not in this for the money. I could go back to earning £2,000 a month as a delivery driver. But my heart is with the children. I’ve found a long-term passion.” The feeling Hussein gets when he trains the kids, he says, is indescribable. “People say: ‘Why don’t you have your own kids?’ But the feeling I get in my heart when I try to better these kids is something I can’t explain. Only Allah knows.” “What he does for the community is amazing,” says Lula Raage. She is a single mother of four; her eldest has special educational needs. Streatham FC is a space for her children to let off steam. “If I didn’t have Hussein’s service I don’t know what I would do,” she says. “They see him as a role model and he understands the challenges I face.” But it’s a struggle, week in, week out. For starters, Streatham FC doesn’t have any facilities. Most of the time, they train at Larkhall Park in Stockwell, south London. But in winter, it’s freezing cold and there’s no shelter. The day we speak, bad weather has meant Hussein cancelling sessions three weeks running. “We had kids cry in a training session because they were so cold,” he says. He is desperate to find an indoor centre they can use. “I’ve made so many inquiries and contacted so many schools,” says Hussein, “but no one can help.” We settle on finding extra sportswear so the kids can stay warm. At Hussein’s request, brands Avec Sport and Fila provide strips for Streatham FC. “Some of the parents can’t afford to buy stuff,” he says, “so having one set of kits means all the kids look the same. We’re really grateful.” Hussein tells me, however, that he feels more bolstered by the recognition than by any gift. “It’s been challenging mentally, trying to do what I do without much support and recognition. There are times when you’re tired and have negative thoughts. To be recognised by a national newspaper has given me belief to keep going.” And with that, he’s off to inspire some more children to believe in themselves, one kickabout at a time.

4/16/2022,"Jake Hamlin lives within earshot of a group of protesters who have set up on the main street in downtown Guerneville, California, for the past several weeks. They probably park themselves outside Smart Pizza for the central location and because of the rainbow flag draped in front of the restaurant. “We can’t get away from it. We can hear them in our living rooms!” he said, adding that they repeat the same chants. “‘This town is gonna burn! There’s more sin here than in San Francisco!’” He said the town will occasionally draw small groups of anti-gay protesters who set up tables with pamphlets, and generally behave politely. But these protesters are different. “The group is very active,” he said. So locals like him are also taking a different approach to counter-protest, and appear to have succeeded in driving the protesters out. As the protesters descended from out of town, always on Wednesdays, harassed passersby, and told locals not to eat at Smart Pizza or other LGBTQ+-friendly businesses, according to Hamlin and fellow townspeople Suzy Kuhr and Dax Berg, they have been met by the self-named Pizza Box Brigade. The Brigade is made up of 30 or so locals who organized via group text and greet the protesters with messages including “Hate is toxic” and “Jesus loves me and my boyfriend” painted on pizza boxes. “It started with my employee, who went out there with a decorated box,” says Suzy Kuhr, who has worked at Smart Pizza for more than 20 years and has owned it since 2015. Word spread fast, and a district supervisor “posted a pic of my employee with his box saying ‘Fuck these people’” adding the online comment, “One of the things I’m thankful for today was Pizza Box Guy.” Gay and straight alike, residents quickly responded and came out in droves to paint their own boxes. Hamlin has heard this group was also protesting in the nearby upscale wine country town of Sebastopol. But Guerneville, approximately 80 miles (130 km) north of San Francisco, with its pride flags and welcoming spirit, truly drew their ire. A 19th-century logging town, Guerneville began attracting queer visitors in the 1970s, becoming home to a number of resorts with a strong gay clientele, plus several annual LGBTQ+-themed weekends and a famous bingo game run by the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, a troupe of drag nuns. A Provincetown or Fire Island Pines of rugged western Sonoma, Guerneville’s small downtown would be a fairly obvious choice for organized homophobes. The protesters were simultaneously very vocal and tight-lipped, Hamlin said, refusing to explain their presence or what organization they represented. These actions are part of a nationwide resurgence of homophobic and transphobic sentiment, with the spread of censorious “don’t say gay” legislation, “anti-grooming” rallies at Disneyworld, and the firebombing of a Brooklyn gay bar. As the protesters were confronted with ever-growing and better-publicized pushback from Guerneville residents, the outsiders seem to have moved on. (Unseasonably cold, drizzly weather the most recent Wednesday may also have been a factor.) If the goal was to shut Smart Pizza down, the protests had the opposite effect. “If anything, it’s brought me more business,” Kuhr says. “I had two or three people who came in last week. They’d read about it in the paper, saying they want to support us.” Dax Berg, who owns Sonoma Nesting Company nearby, said he would set up a stereo to blast Johnny Cash’s Personal Jesus and other curated songs. “The realty office and the bank would call me and say, ‘Would you put your music on?’ That’s God’s way of smiling at me,” Berg says. “When you are bullied, you need to defend yourself in the most effective, judicious manner.” The Pizza Brigade’s message has spread throughout the town, with locals asking to borrow pizza boxes so they can join in. “There was a little old lady, who must have been 85,” Berg said. “And she asked, ‘Do you have one for me?’ She took a ‘Love is love’.”",News/World news,‘Jesus loves me and my boyfriend’: how one gay-friendly town repelled homophobic protesters,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/16/california-homophobic-protesters-guerneville
4/16/2022,"The former cabinet minister Robert Jenrick has criticised the scheme to resettle refugees from Ukraine as “overly bureaucratic”, after he is thought to have become the first MP to welcome a Ukrainian family to Britain. He described the process by which Maria, 40, and her two children, Bohdan, 15, and Khrystyna, 11, had got to the UK as “traumatic”. The children’s father has stayed in Ukraine to fight the Russian invasion, as is the law there. Speaking on the Daily Telegraph’s Chopper’s Politics podcast, he said: “It has been a very difficult experience for them. Even the experience of coming here was traumatic. “They spent seven hours queueing at the Polish border before they were able to finally leave Ukraine, catch the flight to the UK, and the experiences which they’ve had, and their relatives have had, in different parts of the country over the last two or three months are really harrowing.” On the visa process, he said: “Truth be told, it has been a bumpy start to the scheme. It’s taken too long to get visas, for us it took about three weeks to get all three visas approved. “And so there are people who are frustrated, it has tested the patience of sponsors and, more importantly, of the families and individuals themselves. “But having been involved in some schemes that are not dissimilar to this in the past, like the Hong Kong scheme, Syrian scheme, Afghan scheme as a minister, as communities secretary, I know that. But I do think that we will get over those bumps, we are getting over them now.” He added: “There were simple things that we could and should have done from the outset, like having the form in Ukrainian, for example. And I’m not sure whether you need to be doing checks on minors who are extremely unlikely to be threats to this country.” He said some security checks were needed, but added: “The checks need to be done quickly and in this case I’m afraid it has taken too long.” Jenrick said he had not yet received the £350 he is entitled to for hosting the family under the government’s Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme. If he is offered it, he said he would either not accept it or pass it directly to the refugees. Several MPs and ministers have said they have applied to host families. Earlier this month, the Conservative MP Duncan Baker said he had welcomed a mother and her son. “So far … it’s been very rewarding to see them feeling safe at last after a very traumatic experience and beginning to stabilise them and rebuild their lives,” Baker said. The environment minister, Victoria Prentis, took in a 25-year-old Ukrainian refugee last month under a separate visitor visa scheme.Last week, the former health secretary Matt Hancock said he planned to house seven Ukrainian refugees at his Suffolk residence. Hancock described the visa process as a “challenge”. By Monday, about 16,400 people had arrived in the UK under Ukraine visa schemes, according to government figures, with 13,200 arriving under the Ukraine family scheme, and 3,200 under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. For both schemes 94,700 applications had been received, and 56,500 visas granted by Thursday, said the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, and the Home Office.",News/UK news,Robert Jenrick criticises UK red tape after taking in Ukrainian family,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/16/robert-jenrick-criticises-uk-red-tape-taking-ukrainian-family
