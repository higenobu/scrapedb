2/17/2022,"A swimmer killed in what is believed the first fatal shark attack off Sydney, Australia, in almost 60 years has been named locally as a British man. Friends said Simon Nellist, 35, “loved the water” and was an experienced diving instructor.  The British expatriate, who it is understood was living in the Wolli Creek area of Sydney, was reportedly training for a charity swim, and was engaged to be married. New South Wales police said the search for his remains would continue at sunrise on Friday. Witnesses said he had been attacked from below at Little Bay. Emergency services were called at around 4.35pm local time on Wednesday. Della Ross, a friend of the victim, told the broadcaster 7News: “Everything that is connected to Simon, to me is connected to the ocean. ‘The news hit us like a truck, because he really is one of the people that makes this Earth better.” He was understood to be training for the Malabar Magic Ocean Swim, due to take place on Sunday, which has now been cancelled. One witness, Kris Linto, said the swimmer was in the water when the shark “came and attacked him vertically”. He told Nine News TV: “We heard a yell and then turned around. It looked like a car just landed in the water. Big splash.” Lucky Phrachnanh, from New South Wales state ambulance, said the victim had “suffered catastrophic injuries as a result of the attack”, adding there was nothing paramedics could have done when they arrived at the scene. The incident is believed to be the first fatal shark attack in Sydney since 1963. The local MP Michael Daley told ABC News Breakfast that the victim, who is understood to have family in the UK, regularly swam at the bay. The attack happened about 150 metres from the beach, which has now been sealed off. Angry local people claimed on social media that fishing off the rocks near the bay could have attracted the predator.",News/Australia news,British man named as victim of fatal Australia shark attack,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/17/british-man-named-as-victim-of-fatal-australia-shark-attack
2/17/2022,"Consumer demand for travel insurance is returning to near pre-pandemic levels, according to the price-comparison site Moneysupermarket, but high energy prices mean it does not expect any profit from tariff switching this year. The financial services platform, which helps consumers compare deals, said revenue from its travel insurance comparisons had bounced back in the last three months of 2021.  Revenues at its Travelsupermarket division reached 35% of 2019 levels in January, as further easing of coronavirus restrictions was announced. However, it said high wholesale energy prices meant there had been no switchable tariffs available to consumers since October. As a result, the London-listed company said it would not make any profit this year from customers using their platform to compare deals from energy providers, although it predicted the tariff-switching market would return in the medium term. Consumers may also face higher insurance premiums this year, according to Moneysupermarket, which said car insurance premiums were climbing, while there had been more significant rises in home insurance premiums. As a result, it said, more consumers had been searching to compare insurance prices. The company said insurance providers were still working out their strategy after the introduction of new insurance rules by the financial watchdog in January. The Financial Conduct Authority’s general insurance pricing regulations are part of efforts to tackle loyalty penalties, where policyholders who renew existing insurance policies are charged higher premiums than new customers. Moneysupermarket, known for its sometimes controversial advertising campaigns, reported a 7% fall in pre-tax profit in 2021 to £100.5m, down from £107.8m a year earlier, partly because of cost increases after acquisitions. The price comparison firm agreed a £101m deal in October to buy the cashback website Quidco, which pays a cash reward to consumers who use its site to click through to shop at specific online retailers. “The addition of cashback aligns well with our purpose of helping households save money and brings new opportunities,” said Peter Duffy, the chief executive of Moneysupermarket Group, which includes MoneySavingExpert.com.",News/Business,Moneysupermarket profits hit as energy crisis offsets travel gains,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/17/moneysupermarket-profits-hit-energy-crisis-travel-insurance
2/17/2022,"A little girl visits her grandparents on an idyllic Spanish island and spends a glorious summer rescuing wildlife. That’s pretty much all you need to know about this beautiful exploration game, designed to recall carefree childhood adventures and a treat to share with your own kids.  Slide, flip and trick your way through a lush desert landscape in a worthy sequel to the excellent snowboarding game, Alto’s Adventure. The “endless runner” genre is extremely familiar to mobile game players, but this is such a lush, relaxing take that it deserves your attention. A compelling and very funny spin-off from the Frogger-like Crossy Road series, this time challenging up to four players to make it through an endless series of castle environments avoiding deadly traps and enemies. Beautiful design and lots of fun with friends. An engrossing 2D platformer in the “metroidvania” subgenre, Dandara works brilliantly on a smartphone, where its gravity-defying “point and move” traversal mechanic feels really at home. Produced by members of the Final Fantasy team, this extraordinary mobile role-playing adventure presents a luscious world via a series of intricate handcrafted dioramas. With random battles, turn-based combat and a save-the-world story, it’s everything you want from a full-size adventure, in the palm of your hand. An ingenious combination of tile-matching puzzle game and turn-based battle strategy sim, Grindstone challenges players to fight their way through ascending levels of a monster-filled castle, unlocking new gear and weapons as they go. Another brilliantly designed confection from Capybara Games, creator of Sword & Sworcery and Super Time Force. A lovely monochrome hidden object game set in a series of busy towns that look like a quaintly European take on the Richard Scarry universe. Players need to track down specific people and objects in each location, opening doors, windows and tent flaps to reveal their targets’ hiding places. Each scene is filled with funny little interactive elements and the whole thing is bursting with character. A gorgeous little freeform puzzle adventure from Hello Games, the creator of No Man’s Sky, The Last Campfire is set in an enchanted forest filled with lost souls who need to be guided to safety. The wide variety of puzzles, crammed with mazes, lifts and levers, give you plenty to mull over as you enjoy the gentle folkloric feel of the world. A truly unique point-and-click adventure following Kai, a teenage girl who has to save the flora on a mutant-filled island, while sharing gossip with the monstrous inhabitants. The gentle pace and very mild peril give you the space and confidence to just wallow in the world and its little dramas. A wonder. The classic educational game of hardship and disease on the American frontier gets a clever and respectful update here. The aim is to guide a small group of adventurers across the wilderness to Oregon, avoiding starvation and disease en route. Careful planning and resource gathering are necessary, especially with the ever present threat of gaming’s ultimate end-of-level boss: dysentery. Imagine an interactive 1980s pop video filled with slick dance moves, cool motorcycle riders and neon-drenched cityscapes; that’s pretty much Sayonara Wild Hearts, a rhythmic music adventure offering astonishing, eye-popping sound and vision. Capturing the spirit of the classic Tony Hawks games, Skate City uses intuitive context-sensitive tricks, flips and jumps to make you feel like a skating superstar as you traverse the super stylised environments. One of the greatest word puzzle games ever made, SpellTower brilliantly places a familiar word discovery challenge within a Tetris-like play field, where letter tiles tumble each time you make a word. Careful planning, situational awareness and a decent vocabulary are the requirements for success – and many weeks of fun. This is golf, but not as your uncle in his Pringle jumper knows it. It’s more of a hilarious physics-based satire on the whole idea of spoiling a good walk, where your ball might become a car or a house or the course might turn into a football pitch or a kitchen. Perfectly ridiculous. Another great word game, this time a single-player variation on Scrabble, where players select words from a limited rota and then attempt to fit them on the board, ensuring they don’t build themselves into a corner.

2/17/2022,"People who cook for a living are paid to make things you and I won’t – or feel we can’t – make at home. Their aim is to retain your custom. It follows that their recipes or tips often feel a little out of reach. It is aspirational fare. They’re still trying to knock your socks off. It is when you ask a chef what they cook for themselves after a late-night shift, or what they shove on their shelves for their toddler’s midweek tea, that you get the good stuff: the deeply relatable, the always useful, the budget-friendly.  Here, then, are recommendations from cooks, chefs and foodies around the country for affordable store-cupboard staples and kitchen basics. From condiments and snacks to tipples, dry goods and spices, these lower-budget wonders taste as good as their better-known or more glamorous counterparts. Some – the wine, the pasta, the chocolate spread – have been subject to blind tastings, with no discernible differences detected. In times of stretch and squeeze, that makes these comfort supplies, in every sense of the word. It’s also a prompt to get taste-testing yourself. Brands capitalise on packaging and blurbs, so more bounty is definitely lurking in blandly marketed basics ranges. And given that, as Jack Monroe has pointed out, supermarkets are surreptitiously retiring those ranges, even as inflation and supply-chain woes hit people’s pockets in terrible ways, driving up demand for them is practically a political stance. Making sure store-cupboard staples, and nice things too, remain affordable is a necessity. Sainsbury’s Chickpeas, 500g, £1.20“Always buy supermarket own-brand packets of dried pulses rather than brands. It’s the same with frozen peas (Tesco Petits Pois, 1kg, £1.40) or broad beans (Asda Freshly Frozen Broad Beans, 750g, £1.75) – go for supermarkets’ own over, say, Birds Eye.” Nixe Sardines in Sunflower Oil, 125g, 49p, Lidl“We don’t buy in a lot of branded food, but when we do we are particular. Mustard has to be Colman’s, Worcestershire sauce is only Lea & Perrins, hot sauce is Tabasco and mayo is homemade or Hellmann’s. But we do love going to the big Lidl across the road, where everything is off-brand, and going on culinary adventures with crisps in a tube called Tingles and preserved fish from the continent. These sardines are perfect on brown buttered toast with thinly sliced onion, and a glass of chilled chenin blanc on the side.”Winemaker’s Selection Fairtrade Paarl Chenin Blanc, 750ml, £5.49, Lidl“Most fun at Lidl is the wine. They have nothing you have heard of, almost nothing over £10 and you rarely find the same thing twice so it’s completely pot luck, which adds to the adventure. We have had some really delicious bottles. The trick is to avoid anything with a vaguely familiar sound and go off-piste – unknown regions, new world, lesser-known grapes – so yes! to Moldovan riesling or South African chenin blanc. We have been pleasantly surprised more often than not, and when we weren’t, it was only a fiver … perfect weekday fun.” Beefeater London Dry Gin, 700ml, £16“This rather than Bombay Sapphire or Hendrick’s: delicious, straight to the point, no fuss and a better drink. It’s great in a negroni.” Jacob’s Cream Crackers, 300g, £1.30“These, and Carr’s water biscuits, over other, more premium crackers every time.” Quixo Chicken Stock 12 Cubes, 120g, 35p, Aldi“There is a huge price difference between using basic supermarket stock cubes and fresh stock. We used the Aldi stock cubes at 6p a litre, for example, compared with a fresh pouch from Borough Broth Co at about £15 a litre. In terms of taste I think the choice of stock cube makes very little difference, plus you can keep them in the cupboard and have them to hand whenever you need them. However, it’s important to remember the fresh stock does have a place when it’s much more the focus – for instance, in a broth-based soup – and has more nutritional benefits, despite being less convenient.” Sainsbury’s House Dry White, 2.25 litres, £13“Some people like to say you should only cook with wine worthy of drinking, but I disagree. I think it can be hard to tell once it is in a dish. We recently cooked a velouté using this wine box and another using a £25 bottle (UVC Chablis Premier Cru, 75cl), and our team struggled to tell the difference when blindfolded. However, if you are opening a bottle of wine to cook with and are going to be left with the rest to drink, I would personally use something more expensive so I can enjoy drinking what is left.” Sainsbury’s Spaghetti, 500g, 70p“I don’t think you can go wrong with using supermarket spaghetti in most dishes, and it saves a lot of money. All spaghettis have the same basic ingredient: durum wheat. It is generally how the pasta is cut that makes the difference in price and changes its texture – something that is not usually important for midweek pasta dishes.” Sainsbury’s Pecorino Romano, 170g, £2.55“There is always a wariness when veering off the familiar path of tried, tested and trusted ingredients. That said, cooks are curious and forever on the lookout for other things, such as a bumper bag of peppercorns for cooking, so as to keep more costly, fragrant peppercorns for grinding over a finished dish. Choosing a pecorino over a costly piece of parmesan aids the pocket too. I use it for all recipes that might call for parmesan, either thinly flaked or grated fine. Or cut in shards to eat at the end of lunch or dinner, or a lovely elevenses. There are myriad pecorino cheeses, so tasting is vital and a splendid adventure.” Waitrose Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 1 litre, £5“I use this as opposed to other, premium olive oil brands when cooking – it’s just as delicious but a lot cheaper. It’s the best way to start and finish pasta dishes.” Sainsbury’s Wheat Biscuits, 860g, £2.75“A cheap and cheerful version of Weetabix, these have a rustic texture but a great, wholesome flavour. At home, I reach for them as a breadcrumb replacement when in need of a crisp texture. I like to lightly crush them before dressing with a heaped tablespoon of gremolata (chopped parsley, lemon zest and garlic) and finely grated parmesan, or to form a golden crust on fillets of fish. Equally delicious for breakfast with milk and yoghurt.” Asda Olive Oil, 1 litre, £3“Rice and olive oil are an essential part of my daily diet. As much as I like to use them, sometimes prices on the market for olive oil are very high. I was happy to find this alternative. Delightful and delicate, it is of a very high quality.”Lidl Nero d’Avola Terre Siciliane, 750ml, £4.79“My must-have when making anything spicy. Flavoursome and with a unique aftertaste, this red wine shows plum and red fruit flavours when young, with high tannins, medium acid and a strong body.” Moser Roth Sea Salt Dark Chocolate Bars, 5 x 25g, £1.49, Aldi“Aldi is the closest big supermarket to me and I really swear by this chocolate: so much cheaper than bigger brands, it strikes the perfect balance of salt to chocolate. I always keep some in the fridge and end my day with a couple of squares.” Al-Rabih Tahini, 454g, £2.69“Tahini is an important pantry staple for me. I buy mine at my local Turkish shop. As opposed to bigger branded jars in supermarkets, it’s always fresher, smoother and more flavoursome. I love to add a drizzle on top of oats, with torn dates and seasonal fruit.” Natco Cumin Seeds (Jeera), 100g, £1.25“Don’t buy those tiny glass jars (at Sainsbury’s, it is 22p per 10g). Instead, head to the ‘world food’ aisle in your local supermarket and grab an amazing-value sack.” Tesco Tortilla Chips, 200g, 76p“Not only are these cheaper than the branded version, they’re simply flavoured with just a pinch of salt, way more versatile and with none of those E numbers and strange synthetic powders.” Belbake Cocoa Powder, 250g, £1.09, Lidl“Rich and dark, this has great intensity and a reddish colour, so is great for dusting on tiramisu or adding to a chocolate brownie with the flour to punch up the flavour. I make a jug of hot chocolate (milk thickened with a little cornflour and cocoa, sweetened with raw sugar) to keep in the fridge and microwave when I want something chocolatey at bedtime that isn’t too calorific, but comforting.” Aldi Brioche Burger Buns, 89p for four“They deliver every time. Softer than cashmere and tastier than anything Paul Hollywood could make.” Mediterranean Direct Spanish White Beans, 580ml, £1.69“I am a huge fan of jarred (as opposed to tinned) beans and chickpeas. I find them to be consistently more skilfully cooked and seasoned, and creamier too. The fancy branded Spanish ones can be expensive so I scour my local corner shops for Spanish or Turkish jars that are half the price.” Dunn’s River Coconut Milk, 400ml, £1“I often use coconut milk in vegan desserts. I chill the cans, scoop off the creamy top, leaving the watery part behind, and whip the creamy bit to a pillowy fluff. I have found for this the more affordable Caribbean brands are best: they tend to have more stabilisers, which I usually try to steer clear of but for this particular use they are key.” Waitrose Essential Mayonnaise, 500ml, £1.10“We use this in our arroz imperial (a classic Cuban dish of yellow rice, chicken, mayo and melted cheese). It’s made with superior oils and it’s just so much better than the mainstream favourite.”Sainsbury’s Tomato Ketchup, 680g, 90p“Heinz might be the best known, but it’s too sweet for me. I prefer more richly flavoured supermarket’s own-brand versions. Perfect as a key ingredient in our barbecue guava sauce.” Bacardi Carta Blanca Rum, 1 litre, £19.50“Bacardi is a much better product than some of the posher and more expensive Havana Clubs. We use it for cocktails and desserts. The coconut rum is sublime.” The Foodie Market Smooth Peanut Butter, 280g, £1.15, Aldi“I like natural-tasting peanut butter and this one is made with 100% peanuts. It has just the right amount of sweetness and, importantly, it doesn’t use palm oil. It’s great value at less than half the price of Meridian, and pretty much just as good.”Nutoka Hazelnut Chocolate Spread, 400g, £1.09, Aldi“I honestly can’t tell the difference between this and Nutella.

2/17/2022,"Aconvergence of dangerous weather conditions, exacerbated by the climate crisis, has set the stage for southern California to see an increase in catastrophic wildfires over the coming decades, according to a new study. Southern California, home to 23 million people, has largely been spared the kind of extreme fire escalation experienced in the northern part of the state, but models drawn up by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, have predicted that will change.  Wildfires in southern California are often driven by dry winds, low humidity and high temperatures, and the climate crisis is creating the perfect conditions for them to burn hotter, faster and more frequently. Analyzing data from 49 climate stations scattered across the southern coast from Santa Barbara to San Diego, the UCLA study found that the region could see double the number of what scientists call “large fire days” by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions are not curbed. Even in a more moderate scenario, where heating is slowed, the researchers’ models showed a 60% increase in high-risk days compared with the late 20th century. “Things are going to get worse,” Glen MacDonald, a professor of geography at UCLA and the lead author of the study, said. The researchers analyzed a series of variables that can increase fire risks and found certain climatic characteristics – especially how dry the air is – usually determine when the biggest blazes erupt. “From that we found that you could sort of predict when you were going to have your large fire probability in southern California,” MacDonald said. After determining the patterns most associated with wildfires, they modeled how those patterns might change in the decades ahead. They found that not only will days get drier, but those days will start to show up earlier in the spring and stick around later into the autumn, thus “extending the probability to a greater part of the year”, he added. They found these high-risk days would probably increase from the 36 days a year documented from the 1970s to the late 1990s, to 71 days a year by 2070. These conditions won’t just produce more fires – they will also affect fire behavior, making them more destructive and harder to contain. Southern California’s landscapes, which are dominated by grassland and shrubland rather than large forests, burn and recover differently from their northern neighbors. Decades of poor land management and tamping down on Indigenous practices of prescribed burnings has also left northern California’s forests overcrowded and primed for bad burns – an issue that’s less prevalent in the south. That’s partly why, MacDonald says, the regions have had such different experiences with wildfire. “It’s not like climatologically we have been dodging the bullet – but we just haven’t seen the same impact that we see in the more remote regions of northern California and the Sierra Nevada in those forested systems.” That doesn’t mean the rest of the state will be spared. A separate study released last year, led by researchers at University of California, Irvine, looked at the temperatures in the Sierra Nevada range during 450 fires that ignited there between 2001 and 2020. Their analysis shows that, as warming gets worse and temperatures continue to spike, fires in Sierra Nevada could increase by 20% or more over the next 20 years. The amount of land burned will increase even more sharply, rising by 25% by the 2040s. “Wildfires are really sensitive to small changes in temperatures,” says Aurora Gutierrez, a project specialist in UCI’s department of earth system science and lead author of the Sierra Nevada study. The researchers found that for every 1C (1.8F) rise in temperature, fire risk increases by up to 22%. Over the next two decades the region is expecting temperatures to increase by 2C (3.6F). “When it’s hot for a long time it leads to these megafires that are resistant to fire suppression practices,” Gutierrez says. “In extreme conditions like this, whatever is going to burn is going to burn – and you can’t really do much to stop it.” Fires are already exhibiting more extreme behavior, adding new challenges to containment efforts. One new phenomenon, documented in a study published on Wednesday and led by MacDonald’s colleagues at UCLA, is blazes are more likely to burn through the night. The study found that, globally, night fires have grown 7.2% in intensity over the last two decades thanks to hot, dry conditions that persist after sunset, closing what was once an essential window to tame the flames. While MacDonald sees these results as a clear call for immediate action to reduce emissions, he emphasized that the models show predictions, not guarantees. There are still ways to avoid a future with even more catastrophic wildfires. “What we are seeing with the climate system is we are loading the dice,” MacDonald says. “It’s a roll of the dice but we are loading them with more and more days where you have this high probability of a fire and that spark has a greater opportunity to occur when it’s really going to cause damage.”",News/US news,‘Loading the dice’: climate crisis could increase southern California wildfires,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/17/california-wildfires-increase-study
2/17/2022,"We’re just under 18 months from the 2023 Women’s World Cup, and when the USWNT run out to play the Czech Republic in the SheBelieves Cup on Thursday the team will look very different from the one that has dominated for the last decade. This is a roster largely devoid of the stars who have won two World Cups and an Olympic title in the last 10 years. Marquee names from Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan to Tobin Heath, Julie Ertz, and Christen Press won’t feature against New Zealand, Iceland or the Czech Republic. Just seven players from the victorious 2019 Women’s World Cup roster and four of that starting 11 are in this 23-player camp.  It’s a necessary change in a program moving away from its veteran stars just as the center of gravity in women’s soccer shifts toward Europe. Indeed, public interest and financial investment has accelerated across Europe. The belief that US domestic leagues and international tournaments like SheBelieves will feature top competition for the US no longer rings true. When it first started, the SheBelieves Cup attracted European giants like England, France and Germany to the United States. Now those teams are hosting their own tournaments on their side of the Atlantic – a tour of the US is perhaps no longer the ultimate test of an international team’s ability. That’s the same in club soccer. Players looking to hone their talent with the best clubs on earth may consider life in Lyon or Barcelona. Those looking to make top dollar (or euro) may want to look at France. Historically, Canadians and Australians sought development in the US. But in recent years they’ve departed in droves to try their hand in England. Looking at those changes, the inquisitive mind may wonder how dominant the USWNT really are. One way to answer that question is to consult the Guardian’s Top 100 Women’s Footballers for 2021. The United States maintains the highest number of players of any nation on the list. You’ll need to dig past the top 50 to find most of them, though. Only three come earlier than that and the first of them (Sam Mewis) comes in at No 20. In contrast, five of the top 10 come from Spain alone. In a testament to Barcelona’s program, all of them play at Camp Nou. The Guardian’s rankings are subjective of course, but they illustrate the fact that, while the USWNT have strength in depth, they no longer have the very best players in the world. And many of the USWNT’s most prominent players – such as Rapinoe, Press, Morgan and Heath – are in their 30s. That’s where Vlatko Andonovski’s SheBelieves roster comes in. Equipped with a roster full of fresh talent – most of them with fewer than 50 caps – Andonovski says this tournament is the continuation of a trial in which players can make their case for their place in the team. It’s a trial he began in November with two friendlies in Australia. A very similar roster performed well there with standout performances from Ashley Hatch, Sophia Smith, Catarina Macario and Mallory Pugh. Andonovski called upon those names in particular (with Pugh the only one of that group with more than 15 caps), suggesting we’ll see them play a more important role going forward. The veterans left off the roster are not banished for good, though. Some, like Mewis and Lindsey Horan, are out due to injury. Crystal Dunn is expecting a child in May. Press took time away from the game to focus on her mental health. Others, though, are out due to their form. For this group Andonovski is making a point. No player – no matter their past achievements – is guaranteed a spot on the team. “They need to perform, they need to play in their markets, they need to play well in their markets, and show that they can still contribute and be valuable for the national team,” Andonovski said. Julie Ertz is navigating the long journey back to form after recovering from yet another knee injury. Andonovski referenced Ertz’s situation a few times, saying her focus needs to be at the club level first. “We all know how good she can be when she is fit,” he said. Heath is fulfilling a childhood dream trying her hand at Arsenal. She has shown flashes of her ability but is not in top form. Rapinoe, meanwhile, ranked third in the NWSL for average goals per 90 minutes in 2021, and scored key goals for the USWNT at the Olympics. But she has shown signs of slowing down with the national team. Rapinoe will turn 37 in July and if she travels to Australia for the 2023 World Cup, it may be in a leadership role, passing the torch while playing a less central role on the pitch. Rapinoe’s long-time USWNT teammate Morgan has not performed to her abilities since the 2019 World Cup. After giving birth in 2020, she embarked on a short-lived career at Tottenham Hotspur before heading back to the NWSL. While showing moments of brilliance and notching four goals for Orlando, she is far from her best. Asked about Morgan, Rapinoe, Press and Heath in particular, Andonovski told the media: “There’s a reason Mia Hamm is not in camp. We’re not calling Mia Hamm and Julie Foudy in camp.” The USWNT, then, are in an era of transition. But Andonovski is a savvy leader who understands the need to evolve. He spoke enthusiastically of a new collective bargaining agreement for NWSL that frees national team players to pursue contracts abroad. He was effusive in his support of players like Macario and Horan seeking challenges abroad in Lyon. And importantly, he’s shown an understanding for the importance of developing the future roster while holding star players accountable. The old guard may not be done quite yet, but we can look forward to a lot more of the likes of Macario, Smith, Hatch and Pugh.

2/17/2022,"Airbus has announced its highest-ever profits and a return to paying a dividend to shareholders, in a sign of the aerospace industry’s burgeoning recovery from the Covid pandemic. The European plane-maker reported a record net income for 2021 of €4.2bn (£3.5bn), in stark contrast to a steep €1.1bn loss in 2020, when the pandemic first hit. The company, which is headquartered in Toulouse, France, made revenues of €52bn, up from €50bn in 2020.  The aerospace industry was one of the worst affected by the pandemic as travel restrictions led to a slump in income for its airline customers. Orders for new planes were among the first things they cancelled. Airbus cut 15,000 jobs in June 2020, including at its UK factory in north Wales, which makes wings, in response to what its chief executive, Guillaume Faury, described as the industry’s “gravest crisis”. Its US rival Boeing cut 30,000, in part reflecting the global grounding of its previous bestseller, the 737 Max, after two fatal crashes. Faury hailed the company’s “remarkable” full-year results on Thursday and said its cost-cutting had paid off as he planned the first shareholder payout in two years. He also highlighted defence, space and helicopter businesses that proved more resilient during pandemic lockdowns. “2021 was a year of transition, where our attention shifted from navigating the pandemic towards recovery and growth,” he said. “The strong financials reflect the higher number of commercial aircraft deliveries, the good performance of our helicopters and defence and space businesses, as well as our efforts on cost containment and competitiveness.” Airbus delivered 611 aircraft during the year, ahead of its target of 600, driven mainly by 483 deliveries of its single-aisle A320, its rival to the Boeing 737. Boeing managed 340 during the year, although it delivered slightly more than Airbus in January 2022 as it looked to renew its previously close rivalry. Airbus said it expected to increase production during 2022 to 720 planes, in an outlook that “assumes no further disruptions to the world economy, air traffic” or internal setbacks. It did not raise its production target for the A320 above the 65 previously announced but said it was talking to its suppliers about raising the rate. Allegra Dawes, a senior analyst at Third Bridge investment group, said she expected Airbus to “dominate the crucial narrow body market in the coming years as the 737 Max trails Airbus’s offerings in both capability and orders”. She added: “Investors will be watching the progress Airbus has made towards achieving its ambitious targets for production ramp up over the coming years. The company has called on suppliers to prepare for a production rate of 70 A320 aircraft per month by 2024. It will be a significant challenge for a weakened supply chain.”",News/Business,Airbus to restore dividend as profits soar to record high,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/17/airbus-restore-dividend-profits-record-high
