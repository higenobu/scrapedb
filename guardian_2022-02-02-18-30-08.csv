2/2/2022,"The Conservative MP and former minister Tobias Ellwood has revealed he is to submit a letter of no confidence to an influential backbench committee. The Conservative party rules state that at least 15% of Tory MPs must write a no-confidence letter to the 1922 Committee to make a leadership challenge possible – this equates to 54.  If 54 letters are received, a confidence vote will be held. If Johnson were to lose, there would be a leadership contest and he would be barred from entering. Speaking on Sky News, Ellwood, the MP for Bournemouth East and former defence minister, said: “This is just horrible for all MPs to continuously have to defend this to the British public. “The government’s acknowledged the need for fundamental change, culture, make-up, discipline, the tone of Number 10, but the strategy has been one, it seems, of survival, of rushed policy announcements like the Navy taking over the migrant Channel crossings. “And attacking this week Keir Starmer with Jimmy Savile… I mean who advised the prime minister to say this? We’re better than this, we must seek to improve our standards and rise above where we are today.” He added: “I don’t think the prime minister realises how worried colleagues are in every corner of the party, backbenchers and ministers alike, that this is all only going one way and will invariably slide towards a very ugly place. “I believe it’s time for the prime minister to take a grip of this; he himself should call a vote of confidence rather than waiting for the inevitable 54 letters to be eventually submitted. “It’s time to resolve this completely so the party can get back to governing, and, yes, I know the next question you will ask, I will be submitting my letter today to the 1922 Committee.” More details to follow…",News/Politics,Ex-minister Tobias Ellwood to submit letter of no confidence in PM,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/02/boris-johnson-ex-minister-tobias-ellwood-to-submit-letter-of-no-confidence-in-pm
2/2/2022,"Sochi in 2014, Seoul in 2018 … and now Beijing in 2022. In recent years the Winter Olympics has gained an intriguing reputation for pitching up in geopolitically sensitive places. With concerns about human rights issues, and an Omicron outbreak disrupting preparations, Emma Graham-Harrison and Vincent Ni consider how China still hopes to stage manage the Games to its political advantage. And, amid rising global temperatures, there’s a fascinating look from the Guardian’s interactive graphics team at the long-term future of the Winter Olympics, given the fast-declining number of cities with reliably cold enough weather to host the event.  A redacted report into the lockdown party culture in Boris Johnson’s Downing Street operation was released this week. Despite a police-enforced lack of detail, the “update” compiled by civil servant Sue Gray conveyed heavy criticism of No 10 – but more damaging was Johnson’s apparent lack of contrition in the face of parliamentary and public outrage. Tory leadership rebellion fears seemed to have subsided for now – but whether voters will prove as understanding remains to be seen. In Opinion, Timothy Garton Ash writes on the west’s division over the future shape of Europe, in stark contrast with Vladimir Putin’s clarity of vision. And on the second anniversary of Brexit, Anand Menon highlights how Britain’s exit from the EU is beginning to bite economically. For a generation of infants who have grown up with masks and social distancing, the end of the pandemic will represent an entirely novel way of living.

2/2/2022,"Michael Gove has doubled down on discredited comments by the prime minister about Keir Starmer’s involvement with the failure to prosecute Jimmy Savile. The secretary for levelling up, housing and communities said Boris Johnson had nothing to apologise for over his claim in the House of Commons that Starmer failed to prosecute the disgraced broadcaster.  Johnson was rebuked by the Commons speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, for the comments, while victims of Savile and Tory MPs, including the former chief whip Julian Smith, have criticised the prime minister. Starmer was head of the Crown Prosecution Service when the decision was made not to prosecute Savile but he was not the reviewing lawyer for the case. Despite the criticism of Johnson’s comments, Gove said Johnson had nothing to apologise for. He told Sky News: “I think this is a uniquely sensitive issue and it does need to be handled with care, and I listen with enormous respect to those who act for victims of the actions of a terrible, terrible criminal. “But – and it’s not a subject that I want to dwell on because it is uniquely sensitive – it is the case that the CPS apologised for the handling of this case and what happened in 2009, and I think we should acknowledge that an apology was given at the time and respect that.” He added: “Keir Starmer acknowledged that mistakes had been made by the organisation of which he was head, to his credit. He was very clear about those mistakes.” As he battled to defend himself from the “partygate” row after a redacted report by the senior civil servant Sue Gray was published, Johnson claimed Starmer “used his time prosecuting journalists and failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile”. Questioned about the comments, Hoyle said “procedurally nothing disorderly occurred but such allegations should not be made lightly”. He added: “While they may not have been disorderly, I am far from satisfied that the comments in question were appropriate on this occasion.” Victims of Savile have called on Johnson to withdraw his attack on Starmer, a lawyer said. Richard Scorer, the head of abuse and public inquiries at the law firm Slater and Gordon, said: “Victims of Savile I have spoken with today have told me that they want Johnson to withdraw these comments and apologise and I call upon him to do that right away.” The Conservative former chief whip Julian Smith said: “The smear made against Keir Starmer relating to Jimmy Savile yesterday is wrong and cannot be defended. It should be withdrawn.”",News/Politics,"Johnson has nothing to apologise for over Savile comments, says Gove",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/02/boris-johnson-nothing-apologise-jimmy-savile-comments-keir-starmer-gove
2/2/2022,"Everton Women are looking for their third manager of the season after sacking Jean-Luc Vasseur after only 10 games in charge. The Frenchman replaced Willie Kirk in October. Vasseur was in charge of Lyon Féminin between 2019 and 2021 and was expected to move Everton up the table but managed only one win in six league games.  Everton, who invested heavily in their squad last summer, issued a statement that said: “Everton can confirm that Jean-Luc Vasseur has left his role as manager of the club’s women’s team. Assistant coaches Frédéric Piquionne and Franck Plaine have also left the club. “Everyone at Everton would like to thank Jean-Luc, Frédéric and Franck for their service and wish them well for the future. Chris Roberts and Claire Ditchburn will take charge of the team on an interim basis.” Everton are third-bottom of the Women’s Super League and face Reading on Sunday.",Sport/Football,Everton Women sack Jean-Luc Vasseur after 10 games in charge,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/02/everton-women-sack-jean-luc-vasseur-after-10-games-in-charge-manager
2/2/2022,"The levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, has said it is a “bogus argument” to suggest there is no new money going into his flagship levelling-up agenda. Gove defended long-awaited plans to close the gap between rich and poor parts of England in the face of accusations they contain no new money and little fresh thinking.  Responding to claims there is no new money for the wide-ranging plans, Gove told Sky News: “I think that’s a bogus argument because the chancellor gave us a huge cheque in the spending review and now we are spending it. “We’re making sure in Wolverhampton, in Sheffield and in other areas that we put our money where our mouth is. And that we make sure that money which in the past was spent too much in London and the south-east is now spent in the north and the Midlands where it’s needed.” Later on BBC Breakfast, he said: “The key thing about the spending review is that it gave me and other government departments a significant amount in the bank and now we’re cashing those cheques and the money is getting out.” He told the programme the government had “12 big missions” for levelling up, adding the pledges “commit us to ensure that research and development spending, the sort of rocket fuel that will help our economy grow, is spread more equally and also that we tackle some of the other underlying inequalities in health and education and housing”. People in the north of England and Midlands had been “overlooked and undervalued for years” by politicians, he said. Gove declined an offer to appear on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, prompting the presenters to “empty chair” the minister – broadcasting an image of a vacant seat in which he would have appeared had he accepted the invitation. 'This empty chair represents empty policies.'On the day that the long-awaited levelling up report is published, Michael Gove has decided to leave our chair empty.@susannareid100 and @adilray extend the invite for @michaelgove to come on the show and explain the report. pic.twitter.com/Xei02dVoM9 “The Brexit referendum was a wake-up call,” Gove told Sky News. “As well as a clear commandment to leave the European Union it was also a way of saying to people in SW1, people like me: ‘Look, it’s vital that you change the economic model of this country. It’s all very well if people are in London and the south-east in financial services and others do well, we don’t begrudge that. But you’ve got to listen to us.’” Gove said mistakes had been made by “parties of both colours” and that “one of the things in the past is there have been sincere and committed attempts by politicians left and right to deal with this”. “But nothing as comprehensive or as long-term as the plan that we’re setting out today,” he said. He again raised the prospect of the House of Lords moving out of London as an example of levelling up. He told Times Radio: “We’ve got our friends in the House of Lords who will have to move out of their current building, at the moment, because of the renovation of the Palace of Westminster. “I think it’d be a really good thing if the House of Lords were to meet for at least part of the time in Glasgow or in York. I think it would do us all good.”",News/Inequality,Michael Gove denies no new money is going into levelling-up,https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2022/feb/02/michael-gove-denies-no-new-money-is-going-into-levelling-up
