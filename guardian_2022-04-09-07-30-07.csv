4/9/2022,"The chocolate firm Ferrero has been forced to extend its recall of Kinder products to include all those manufactured at a site in Belgium. The previous recall was announced amid salmonella concerns and only covered products with best-before dates up to 7 October, 2022. But now it has widened it to include all Kinder products manufactured at Ferrero’s Arlon site since June. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) said the latest update means all the products in the recall notice, no matter what the best-before date is, should not be eaten. The products affected by the recall are Kinder Surprise, Kinder Mini Eggs, Kinder Surprise Egg 100g and Kinder Schoko-Bons. Tina Potter, head of incidents at the FSA, said the agency is continuing to investigate the outbreak of salmonella cases linked to the Kinder products. “Consumers should follow the advice in the latest recall notice, which details all of the products which may pose a risk,” she said. “We have emphasised to the business and the authorities in Belgium the importance of taking as precautionary an approach to their recall as possible and trust that they will continue to put consumers’ needs first in any action they take. “We continue to work closely with UK and international partners, including the UK Health Security Agency and Food Standards Scotland, to establish how this outbreak started and make sure all necessary steps have been taken to prevent further illness.” The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said on Friday that 67 people in the UK, mostly young children, are known to have been infected with salmonella by Wednesday. Earlier in the week Dr Lesley Larkin, of the UKHSA, said: “Anybody with concerns that they have symptoms of salmonellosis should contact their GP or call NHS 111. “Salmonella can be spread from person to person, so anyone affected should adhere to good hygiene practice such as washing hands thoroughly after using the bathroom and avoiding handling food for others where possible, if you have symptoms.” Symptoms, which include diarrhoea, stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting and fever, usually clear up within a few and can sometimes be more severe, especially in young children and those with weakened immune systems.",Lifestyle/Food,Ferrero extends recall of Kinder products due to salmonella cases,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/apr/08/ferrero-extends-recall-of-kinder-products-due-to-salmonella-cases
4/9/2022,"Eight years Rory McIlroy has been coming here to try and win the major he needs to complete the grand slam, and it feels like he’s gone about it in eight different ways. There was the McIlroy who had discovered meditation, and the McIlroy who fixated on his method, the McIlroy who had been reading self-help books, the McIlroy who was studying the swing science, and the McIlroy who was muscled up because was spending so much time in the gym; there was McIlroy who talked up how much Masters meant, and the McIlroy who played it down. None of them got it done. So this year, he’s brought boring Rory. At the start of the week McIlroy kept talking about being conservative, disciplined, and patient. His plan was to play for the middle of the green, pick off the birdie putts when they come, and make sure you stay away from the kind trouble that ends up in the big numbers that leave him too much to do come Sunday. Which wasn’t a bad strategy so far as they go, the only trouble with it is, as he said himself, it isn’t a style of play that comes naturally to him. McIlroy’s a risk-taker, a shot-maker, a heart-breaker: he sees too many possibilities in the game to take it so slow and steady. “It goes against my nature.” It might be better suited to one of the two men he was paired with – Brooks Koepka, who has always seemed like a man who knows exactly what he wants to do, and how he’s going to try and do it. It was an intriguing grouping. Koepka’s 31, McIlroy’s 32, they’ve both won four majors, and they have a bit of history. Once, when Koepka was asked if they were rivals, he said that they couldn’t be because McIlroy hadn’t won any majors since he came on tour. McIlroy pointed out, not long afterwards, that Koepka had only won four other tour events. He didn’t mention that he’s won 14 in the same time. He didn’t need to. Koepka’s not so outspoken any more, his form has fallen off since he had knee surgery last year, and here he followed up his first round 75 with another, and finished up out of it at six shots over par. He’s just discovering a lesson McIlroy learned a long time ago, which is that the game’s not always as easy as it seems when you’re winning everything. McIlroy covered the front nine in even par, a birdie at the 2nd balancing out a bogey at the 5th, but he did it the hard way. At that 2nd, he blew his drive wide right into the trees, then threaded his way out on to the front of the green and hit a wizardly 30-yard chip. He saved par with a superb putt from the front fringe at 3rd. Then he found himself in trouble again off the 5th tee. His drive flew left this time, into a swale behind a clump of pine trees, an impossible obstacle which he, incredibly, managed to clear easily with a high draw over the top-most branches. He had less luck at the long uphill 8th, where his wild drive left him no choice but to chip back on to the fairway. It was about now that things started to get really interesting. The wind was starting to pick up, and it soon grew so stiff it was whipping the sand up out of the bunkers. From here on in, it became a different game, and a test of the way McIlroy says he wants to play. At the 10th, he got himself in a tangle when he lumped his second shot into a bunker, exactly the kind of mistake he said he’d promised himself he wasn’t going to make, then he blew a 6-iron wide and three-putted the 11th for a double-bogey six. That meant he had dropped three shots in the space of 15 minutes, and all of a sudden, he was back at four-over, with one eye on the cut-line coming up fast behind him. He wasn’t the only player blown off course. Up ahead of him, Jordan Spieth had just picked up a triple bogey at the 12th by going in and out, and in and out, of Rae’s Creek. “That wasn’t a great visual,” said McIlroy, who was watching from the 11th. Unlike Spieth, and Koepka for that matter, McIlroy did manage to pull it around, with birdies at the 13th and 16th. That put him right back at two-over, out of trouble, and, given how congested the leaderboard was getting, back in contention. It was some recovery. But even then he wasn’t done with the drama. There was one more loose drive at the 18th, right into the trees, and from there he fetched up in a greenside bunker, and was able to get up and down for a last par. How did he do it? “It’s maturity. It’s experience. It’s walking away 13 years in a row empty-handed,” he said. So yes, he’s close enough to fancy he’ll be in reach of the lead over the weekend. “I feel like I’m right there.” The score, 74, was the only steady thing about his rollercoaster round. He wasn’t kidding when he said that playing boring Rory isn’t really him.",Sport/Sport,Patience keeps McIlroy in Masters reckoning with a few dramas on way | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/08/patience-keeps-mcilroy-in-touch-at-masters-with-a-few-dramas-on-way
4/9/2022,"The sister of the oligarch and former Arsenal football club shareholder Alisher Usmanov has been sanctioned by the EU after an investigation by the Guardian named her in connection with 27 Swiss bank accounts containing billions of pounds. Usmanov’s sister, Saodat Narzieva, was among a number of relatives of Russian officials and oligarchs added to the EU’s sanctions list on Friday in response to the war in Ukraine. Usmanov has been under EU sanctions since February. “Alisher Usmanov has transferred considerable assets to his sister Soadat Narzieva, including a single payment or gift of $3m,” the EU said. “She also held 27 Swiss bank accounts, holding hundreds of millions of dollars, which can be linked to her brother,” it said, citing findings from a recent investigation by the Guardian and media partners including the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project. Last month, the Guardian and partners revealed that Usmanov’s sister appeared to have been a one-time beneficial owner of 27 secret corporate accounts at Credit Suisse, many of which were linked to Usmanov’s media, metals and mining conglomerate. While a handful of the accounts were closed by 2016, up to 18 of the accounts were still active in recent years and could be frozen as a result of the EU sanctions. One of those accounts held as much as 1.9bn Swiss francs (CHF) (£1.6bn) and another held nearly 1.4bn CHF (£1.2bn), according to leaked documents seen by the Guardian as part of the Suisse secrets leak that revealed the owners of 30,000 Credit Suisse clients. Credit Suisse said it was unable to comment on individual accounts because of Swiss banking secrecy laws, but confirmed that “as a matter of principle and policy, the bank applies all sanctions, in particular those issued by the EU, the United States and by Switzerland” … As we have made clear, our strategy puts risk management at the very core of our business.” It is not clear why Narzieva, who is a gynaecologist and obstetrician in a maternity hospital in Uzbekistan’s capital, Tashkent, was named on accounts associated with her brother’s business empire. A spokesperson for Usmanov has previously said the Credit Suisse data was “fake and incorrect” and said there was nothing untoward about his financial relations with his sister. They also said that Narzieva did not have “possession or control of any accounts in Swiss banks on behalf of her brother”. A spokesperson for Narzieva said she does not know why her name would appear as a beneficial owner for any accounts at Credit Suisse and “has never held money or other assets on Mr Usmanov’s behalf. Rather, she has been in receipt of gifts from her brother. These long predate the current international crisis and recent sanctions regimes.” “Furthermore, these gifts, while considerable in absolute terms, are of limited significance when measured against Mr Usmanov’s business interests and personal fortune,” the spokesperson said. It is the first time that the Uzbek-born businessman’s sister has been sanctioned as a result of her relationship to her brother. Usmanov, who has been described as “one of Vladimir Putin’s favourite oligarchs” and once held a 30% stake in Arsenal football club, has also been sanctioned by the US and UK. Usmanov was not immediately available for comment.",News/World news,EU sanctions Alisher Usmanov’s sister,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/08/eu-sanctions-alisher-usmanovs-sister
4/9/2022,"Thomas Tuchel held a meeting with his players on Thursday to urge that they wake up after consecutive damaging home defeats, having stayed up the previous night watching reruns of the reverse against Real Madrid that left Chelsea’s Champions League defence hanging by a thread. The Chelsea squad were forced to sit through what Tuchel described as “not a discussion meeting … more that I gave my point of view” on the back of Real’s 3-1 win in the quarter-final first leg and the 4-1 Premier League thrashing by Brentford. Tuchel said no blame was apportioned but made no secret of his concern about their form since returning from the international break. “I felt how untypical these kinds of mistakes and performances were for us,” he said when asked if clearing the air might lead to a change in fortunes. “That led to my reaction. I don’t know if it’s a turning point. You need to take care about the process and right now it was to be honest with the team, explain your reactions and why it is like this. It is necessary the players see, and can handle if the manager is angry.” Tuchel thought his players had subconsciously operated at a lower tempo after coming back from their national teams. “Somehow after the international break we had the feeling like we play with 80%, 90% and we hope to get away with it, and it is not like this,” he said. “There are a lot of reasons, which can be reasons that you feel exhausted. But you need to overcome it. There is no other way and we need to kind of wake up, or remind ourselves again that the investment physically was not enough in the last two matches. We need to find high-intensity work again because this is what we do and this is what we lacked in the last two matches.” Immediately after the defeat on Wednesday night Tuchel, who was on entertaining and expansive form despite his disappointment, declared Chelsea’s hopes of a comeback at the Bernabéu on Tuesday to be nonexistent. He explained that his post-match anger had taken uncharacteristically long to abate. “That I stay angry overnight is pretty unusual, yes,” he said. “But the feeling lasted. I watched the match again and I got angry at home, in the middle of the night, and the next morning I watched it again and got angry again. “You sit there in the middle of the night and the amount of chocolate I needed was immense to go through the match again and compensate. It’s not nice, you start writing and writing and writing and at some point you press the button to watch it in double speed, just so it passes quicker, and then you know you’re not in a good place. At some point you have to stop and take a walk into the kitchen or lounge, and calm down.” Tuchel hopes for a response when Chelsea visit Southampton on Saturday.

4/9/2022,"Steven Gerrard is still deliberating over who will be his long-term Aston Villa captain and has not ruled out the prospect of signing a new leader to wear the armband as part of his summer recruitment drive. Gerrard said the current skipper, Tyrone Mings, is a strong candidate but that he will make a decision before the start of the next season. The 29-year-old England defender has captained Villa this season but Gerrard is keen to add leaders to his squad in the summer. Gerrard is also thought to be keen on signing a defensive midfielder, as well as a striker. The Villa manager said he has been open with Mings about his thoughts on the situation. “I think it is always important to get in among the group and see what they are like, every minute of every day, see who is the glue in the team, see who leads in the right way, see who leads through adversity, not just when the sun is shining, see who is prepared to go above and beyond and sets the right standard on a daily basis,” Gerrard said. “We are still working that out. I still won’t rule out the option of someone coming in, who I know, who is also capable of being in the running. It is something I am analysing really closely now and I will make a decision some time during pre-season.” Asked whether he needed to broach the subject carefully with Mings, Gerrard replied: “Not at all. Ty was really appreciative of having the opportunity to continue with the armband. I made it clear to him first before we put it public that it was what we were going to do. Ty is in with a really good shout, I’ve been really happy with him.

4/9/2022,"Jürgen Klopp expects Manchester City to remain “calm as ice” and immune to the pressure of Liverpool’s re-emergence in the title race when the Premier League rivals meet on Sunday. Pep Guardiola’s champions have seen a 14-point lead over Liverpool in January reduced to one before a potentially decisive contest at the Etihad Stadium, with Klopp’s team winning 10 consecutive Premier League matches and a club record eight successive away games in all competitions. But the Liverpool manager, who has a full squad available for his side’s 50th game of the season, does not believe “the best team in the world” will be unnerved by the growing threat to their defence of the title. Klopp said: “I know it was 14 points but we had two games in hand, one was Leicester and the other Arsenal. Would I [feel pressure if the roles were reversed]? I don’t know. I’m not sure if I’ve ever been 14 ahead and then all of a sudden only one. “I wouldn’t imagine they will feel more under pressure. It’s more like – focus on yourself knowing about the situation, looking at the form you are in and that is all OK. It’s not like I think: ‘Ah, they’re under more pressure than us.’ They play at home, they are calm as ice in most of the games they play and we have to be as well. “It’s an important game, a very important game, but it’s how we realised in the beginning: there is a season after this game and these games are as important as the others. “Our programme is insane. We play City, Benfica, City, United and Everton. They will all hope if we win one of the City games that we celebrate for three or four days but we will not. For us it is very exciting, very interesting and I’m really looking forward to it but it is business as usual as well. It’s just a big game, which we had now since we started our chase properly. All the games were finals and this is no different.” One point separates Liverpool and City not only this season but cumulatively over the past four league campaigns. Klopp’s team have collected 337 points from 144 games while Guardiola’s have won 338 in 144 matches as the two clubs have dominated the Premier League. The Liverpool manager reflected: “I’m surprised about the numbers to be honest. It’s massive. They wouldn’t have the points they have if we weren’t there and it’s the same the other way around. We obviously pushed each other properly, that’s the truth. If somebody would have asked me four years ago: ‘Do you think that’s possible and are you that close?’ I would have said: ‘Not really.’ I know how people see us and them. “Man City is considered the best football team in the world and they got one point more than us – what does that say? I think as well they are the best football team in the world but they have only one point more than us in this time. “So obviously we did something right. I’m happy about that but it would be better if we had 20 points more in that period, then we would have one more title or won more silverware. But it’s all fine how it is. That’s the basis we created, let’s go from there.” Klopp admitted his rivalry with Guardiola and City is more equal than during his time challenging Bayern Munich’s dominance in Germany with Borussia Dortmund. He added: “The main difference between Dortmund/Bayern and Liverpool/City is that at Dortmund we lost important players every year, Bayern never. That’s the difference in the situation, clearly. That’s why we could build here. We are much more equal at least than we were with Bayern because we could develop and build on what we did before. I don’t care if we are equal but we are much closer than we were with Dortmund, that’s for sure.” Meanwhile, Mohamed Salah has described his contract talks with Liverpool as a “sensitive situation” but insisted they are not a distraction. Salah has 16 months remaining on his current deal and has long been talking to the club he joined from Roma in 2017 about an extension. The hold up is believed to centre on the Egyptian’s £400,000-a-week wage demands, which would make him the highest earner at Anfield by some distance. “There are many things that people don’t know about it – I can’t be selfish and talk about my situation [because] we are in the most important situation that is coming for the team,” Salah told Sky Sports. “I’ve said many times what I want but I can’t really go deep into the contract now because it is a sensitive situation. I am just focused on the team. That is the most important thing for me, [being] focused to win trophies and I’m just giving everything for the club.”",Sport/Football,Jürgen Klopp expects Manchester City to stay ‘calm as ice’ in title showdown,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/08/jurgen-klopp-manchester-city-liverpool
4/9/2022,"Frank Lampard insists he is not worried about his future as Everton manager but accepts the pressure will intensify with the club embroiled in a fight for Premier League survival. Lampard has been unable to arrest Everton’s slide towards the relegation zone since replacing Rafael Benítez and speculation over his position has started after merely 12 games in charge. The Everton manager has lost eight and won four of his matches so far and, despite the destabilising hire-and-fire culture created by the club’s owner, Farhad Moshiri, claims his only concern is delivering victory against Manchester United on Saturday. “I can’t control it so I can’t worry about it,” said Lampard of the sacking rumours that followed Wednesday’s damaging defeat at Burnley. “I have tried to answer it honestly. I am not stupid, you take up a job as a manager in the Premier League, and maybe in the situation I came into here or at Chelsea where I go into it with a [transfer] ban, and half a team of kids who were playing in the Championship the year before, yet the expectation was we finish in the top four. “That’s just the reality of the job we do. So in that sense I’m not worried. I am just worried I get my job right tomorrow. I am just worried about picking the right team as I see it, the people who want to fight and give everything to the club, to win a result tomorrow. I understand it, but that’s my main worry.” Everton have nine matches to avoid a first relegation since 1951 but face a daunting schedule with United, Leicester, Liverpool, Chelsea and Leicester to play again in the next five games. Lampard, who has spoken with Moshiri and chairman Bill Kenwright this week, added: “In my relatively short managerial career I probably spent 18 months at Chelsea with the same, for 18 months you are probably two games from the sack. Maybe that is a symptom of football and the Premier League. That’s pressure. No problem, you sign up for that. I have no problem with that. Even if you get to an FA Cup final and make top four you still know the rules. “I have no problem with that in terms of speculation. We are a huge club and people want to talk about it. In football terms I don’t think people should talk about us any different to the teams we are in the battle with. We have no right to not be fighting a battle against relegation, irrespective of the history. But what I am is proud to manage here and proud to keep the history of the club going in a positive way.”",Sport/Football,‘I can’t control it’: Frank Lampard not worried about his Everton future,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/08/frank-lampard-everton-future-manchester-united
4/9/2022,"Ralf Rangnick has given the Manchester United board his verdict on his squad and which of their underachieving players he thinks should stay or go in the summer overhaul at Old Trafford. The interim manager has also offered to brief his successor – likely to be Erik ten Hag – on his conclusions from his six-month reign in temporary charge. Rangnick will remain involved at United with a consultancy role for the next two seasons but, while he has not played a leading role in the recruitment process for his successor and was reluctant to discuss the move for Ten Hag, he is willing to offer the current Ajax manager, or whoever ends up being United’s next permanent manager, his thoughts on the present group. “I have already done this, not to any managers, but inside the club,” said Rangnick. “I have told them how I see the current squad and what needs to happen in my opinion. I spoke regularly with board members and they know what I think needs to happen in the summer. If he [the next manager] is interested and willing to speak about that and interested in my opinion I will see what happens.” His own future has become clearer. “We have agreed upon a contract as an advisor,” Rangnick said. “I know with which coaches they have spoken to and that is why I can say they are all top coaches. This is true of Erik ten Hag, if they have spoken to him.” Rangnick believes Donny van de Beek, who excelled for Ten Hag at Ajax, could revive a United career that has brought just four league starts. “Why not?” he said. “But it also depends on the new manager and the way he wants to play and for Donny that is what he told me in conversations we had together.” The midfielder, who is on loan at Everton, is ineligible to face his parent club on Saturday when United will kick off languishing in seventh place. “We cannot afford to drop points,” Rangnick said. “I think everyone is aware of that.” While Cristiano Ronaldo, who missed last weekend’s draw with Leicester City because of illness, is back, Rangnick’s task is made harder by the absence of four injured players. Edinson Cavani remains out and is joined on the sidelines by Scott McTominay, Raphaël Varane and Luke Shaw, depriving Rangnick of his first-choice defensive midfielder, central defender and left-back respectively. Shaw will undergo surgery on Saturday to remove metal screws inserted in his right leg after it was broken in 2015. The left-back will be out for two weeks and miss the trip to Liverpool on 19 April owing to an injury that came as an unwelcome surprise to Rangnick. “To me it came quite unexpectedly and the same is true of our medical department,” he said. “Five minutes before half-time he had an issue and at half-time the doctor came to see me and said he could not continue and, since then, we have been discussing what is best and they decided to have the two bolts removed.”",Sport/Football,Ralf Rangnick ready and willing to brief Manchester United successor on rebuild,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/08/ralf-rangnick-ready-and-willing-to-brief-manchester-united-successor-on-rebuild
4/9/2022,"Thomas Partey could join Kieran Tierney in missing the rest of Arsenal’s chase for the Champions League spots after Mikel Arteta said the midfielder had sustained a “significant” injury. Arsenal’s thin squad can ill afford long-term absentees and Tierney’s knee problem, which required surgery and will leave him on the sidelines until at least the summer, was a heavy blow to their ambitions. Losing Partey, who limped off with an injury to his right thigh during the 3-0 defeat at Crystal Palace on Monday night, for the run-in would present a sizeable headache on top of that and Arteta did not sound confident that he would be seen again in the coming nine games. “It’s a little bit ambiguous but he has a significant injury and we’ll have to keep assessing him,” he said. “He will be for some weeks. It could be [that he can play again this season] but it could not be the case, because it’s an area where he had a previous injury as well and he felt it straightaway. He’s not fit.” Arteta hopes his remaining players will rediscover some form against Brighton at the Emirates on Saturday before a testing spell that brings games at Southampton, Chelsea and West Ham along with the visit of Manchester United. The manner of the reverse at Selhurst Park rang alarm bells among the fanbase but he accepts heightened reactions come with the territory in which they find themselves. “The expectations have risen and we have to manage that,” he said of his fifth-placed side, who are level on points with fourth-placed Spurs but have a game in hand. “This is great. It’s much better than being in a completely different position. So we have to embrace that challenge and be aware of that. It’s our job and our responsibility. “[The reaction] is something that has been coming for weeks and [they players] sense it. They sense the change in spirit, the energy around the club and the expectations of the way they are playing and performing. They could see that coming. They have been performing really well, but when a lot of things happen in the same week it’s more complicated. But as well it would be great to learn from what happened on Monday.” Arteta was asked whether he was paying the price for his decision to part company with a number of squad players in January. “But they were players that we did not really use,” he said. “And you put them in the context now, I don’t know how much they would have played. You don’t know, I don’t know.”",Sport/Football,Arsenal’s Thomas Partey could miss rest of season with ‘significant’ injury,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/08/arsenals-thomas-partey-could-miss-rest-of-season-with-significant-injury
