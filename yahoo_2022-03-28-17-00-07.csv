3/28/2022,"“The Academy does not condone violence of any form,” reads a statement posted to the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences’ Twitter account about two hours after Will Smith walked onstage and slapped presenter Chris Rock after Rock made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith. Hollywood Reacts To The Oscar Slap: Physical Assault, Say Many; “How We Do It”, Says Jaden Smith More from Deadline Oscars: ‘CODA’ Wins Best Picture; 'Dune' Leads With Six Trophies – Full Winners List Oscar Afterparty Photo Gallery: The Governors Ball, Vanity Fair, Elton John & More Oscar Crafts & Shorts Pre-Show Controversy: What Was Said Backstage The Academy tweet then sought to refocus attention on the more dignified elements of the evening: “Tonight we are delighted to celebrate our 94th Academy Awards winners, who deserve this moment of recognition from their peers and movie lovers around the world.” But it was a tough sell, especially among those in the usually Oscar-obsessed entertainment industry. The Last Samurai producer Marshall Herskovitz wanted to see the Academy do more than just issue a statement. Oscars TV Review: Will Smith’s Unscripted Slap Of Chris Rock Turns Stumbling Show Into Stunning Spectacle “I call upon the Academy, of which I am a member,” he wrote, “to take disciplinary action against Will Smith. He disgraced our entire community tonight.” For his part, Rock decided not to file a police report — at least for now. That means Smith will not be charged with assault or face the up to six months behind bars and a fine up to $100,000 that could result from such a charge.

3/28/2022,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Support for Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's government rose overall for the first time in three months, with crucial elections just months away, as nearly 70% of respondents said they approved of his response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Some 67% of respondents to a weekend survey conducted by the Nikkei daily and TV Tokyo said they approved of the government's response to the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which Russia calls a ""special military operation"". Only 22% disapproved in the survey, conducted on a monthly basis. Overall, support for Kishida, who took office in October, stood at 61%, a rise of 6 points from a month ago. Japan has slapped sanctions on a broad range of Russian individuals and organisations, as well as saying it will revoke Russia's most-favoured nation trade status - a contrast to its lukewarm response to Russia's seizure of the Crimea in 2014 under former prime minister Shinzo Abe. The strong support is also good news for Kishida, a former foreign minister, ahead of a crucial election for the upper house of parliament in July. A strong win for his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) would allow him several election-free, politically stable years in which to pursue his policy goals. The government also won plaudits for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic amid a recent fall in new cases. Some 64% said they approved, a rise of 8 points from a February survey - and the highest since the question was introduced in the survey in February 2020. The government of Kishida's predecessor, Yoshihide Suga, was plagued by public perceptions that it had bungled Japan's response to the pandemic sank.
