5/5/2022,"The online activities of the Australian white supremacist who opened fire on two New Zealand mosques – and how much of a role social media and internet platforms played in his radicalisation – will form part of a coroner’s inquiry into the deaths of 51 Muslim worshipers in the 2019 Christchurch terrorist attack. But the presiding coroner, Brigitte Windley, who announced the scope of her inquiry in a decision released on Thursday, has warned of “monumental hurdles” to exploring the terrorist’s online activities – including Brenton Tarrant’s attempts to wipe parts of his digital footprint before committing the attacks. The 15 March 2019 attack was planned for an online audience; the gunman streamed live footage and posted a manifesto online before he shot dozens of people at two mosques during Friday prayers. Windley’s decision to include the terrorist’s online activity in her investigation of what factors caused the deaths was welcomed by some Muslim groups, who had asked her at a preliminary hearing in February to examine the influence of social and digital media platforms. “This is a landmark moment for the accountability of digital platforms,” said Aliya Danzeisen, the national coordinator of the Islamic Women’s Council of New Zealand. She added that the coroner had “opened the door to investigating the responsibility” of online platforms in the radicalisation of Tarrant and others. Many of the bereaved families had earlier decried the government’s decision to exclude the actions of private companies – including online platforms – from the royal commission into the attacks, which published its report in December 2020. Windley said she would focus on Tarrant’s online activities between 2014 and 2017, during which he travelled the world extensively, and before he moved to New Zealand from Australia and began planning the attack in earnest. It was a window not covered by earlier investigations, she said. It is known that Tarrant spent particular time on YouTube and the message boards 4chan and 8chan. But the coroner said she would not scrutinise the actions taken by online platforms to monitor their users for extremist content unless her inquiry uncovered evidence that Tarrant’s online activities were a significant cause of his radicalisation. His “psychological makeup” and “upbringing in provincial New South Wales” were among other factors, she said. Windley has ordered Tarrant to divulge the location of a hard drive missing from his Dunedin flat after the attacks, and whether information on it was uploaded to cloud-based storage. The gunman was sentenced in August 2020 to life in prison without the chance of parole after pleading guilty to 51 counts of murder, 40 of attempted murder and a terrorism charge. Tarrant’s guilty plea, which averted a criminal trial, meant the evidence against him was never heard, and the royal commission was conducted entirely behind closed doors. In a report of more than 800 pages, it concluded that while New Zealand’s counter-terrorism agencies had focused on Islamist terror threats to the exclusion of other ideologies, Tarrant’s attack could not have been prevented “except by chance”. Some families bereaved in the massacre, New Zealand’s worst modern-day mass killing, have over the past three years raised what they say are lingering questions about whether their relatives’ deaths could have been prevented – either in the lead-up to or immediate aftermath of the attack. For many, the lack of access to material investigators had relied upon – some of which will now be provided to them as part of the coronial inquiry – has prompted distrust in official conclusions about the case. In her 99-page decision outlining the inquiry’s scope, Windley acknowledged the “information void” to date for the bereaved families and survivors, but stopped short of expanding her inquiry to cover everything they had asked her to investigate. It will include: The events of 15 March 2019, from the moment the attack began. How the police, ambulance service and nearby Christchurch hospital responded. An examination of the police’s conclusion that Tarrant acted alone. The final moments of those who died and whether their injuries could have been survivable with different treatment. Whether the police granting Tarrant a gun licence despite his lack of appropriate references – allowing him to legally amass semiautomatic weapons – could be directly linked to the attack, and if so, how procedures for gun licensing have changed since. How New Zealanders can detect and respond to people who pose a risk of violent extremism in future. A public inquest would be held into the emergency response to the attacks, Windley said. She had not yet determined whether any other part of her inquiry would be heard publicly. An inquest date has yet to be scheduled. The inquiry’s timeframe is unknown.",News/World news,Christchurch attack inquiry to examine if Australian terrorist was radicalised online,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/05/christchurch-attack-inquiry-to-examine-if-australian-terrorist-was-radicalised-online
5/5/2022,"Ukrainian forces are fighting “difficult bloody battles” against Russian troops inside the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol, Reuters reported, citing a Telegram video message from the commander of the Azov battalion. A Ukrainian official said on Wednesday that Russian forces entered the steelworks where the city’s last resistance has been holding out but contact remained with the defenders. Another 344 people have been rescued from the besieged city of Mariupol in a second evacuation operation, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has confirmed a national address. Russia has said it will implement a daytime ceasefire for three days from Thursday to allow more civilian evacuations from the Azovstal plant. “The Russian armed forces will from 8 am to 6 pm (Moscow time) on 5-7 May open a humanitarian corridor from the territory of the Azovstal metallurgical plant to evacuate civilians,” the defence ministry said. Joe Biden said he would speak with other G7 leaders this week about potential additional sanctions against Russia. His treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, said the US was in constant discussions with its partners about this. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he believed Ukraine would again see peace despite Russia’s war but warned that what happens in Ukraine will have important consequences for the rest of Europe. Addressing the people of Denmark on the 77th anniversary of their liberation from Nazi occupation, he said: “I do believe our day of liberation is coming close.” Russia has practised simulated nuclear-capable missile strikes in the western enclave of Kaliningrad, sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania along the Baltic coast. Forces rehearsed simulated “electronic launches” of nuclear-capable Iskander mobile ballistic missile systems, the defence ministry said. Sweden has received assurances from the US that it would receive support during the period a potential application to join Nato is processed by the 30 nations in the alliance, the Swedish foreign minister, Ann Linde, said in Washington. Brazilian presidential frontrunner Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has said Zelenskiy and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, bear equal responsibility for the war, putting the leftist candidate at odds with western powers. The bodies of 20 more civilians were found in the past 24 hours in the Kyiv region, according to Kyiv’s regional police chief, Andriy Nebytov. The latest discoveries, in the town of Borodianka and the surrounding villages, raise the total number of civilian bodies found in the region to 1,235. The European Union is proposing to ban all Russian oil imports in a sixth package of sanctions. The European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, said Putin had to pay a “high price for his brutal aggression” in Ukraine. Hungary’s international relations minister, Zoltán Kovács, said his country would veto the EU proposal. As many as 600 people were killed in the Russian bombing of a theatre in Mariupol in March, according to an investigation by the Associated Press. Based on the accounts of nearly two dozen survivors, rescuers, and people familiar with the theatre, AP found evidence that the attack was twice deadlier than estimated. The head of the Russian Orthodox church, Patriarch Kirill, is reportedly on the draft blacklist of the EU’s next round of sanctions. An EU document claims Kirill has been “one of the most prominent supporters of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine” and a key player in amplifying Vladimir Putin’s rhetoric on Ukraine. Ukraine has accused Russia of planning to hold a Victory Day military parade in the captured city of Mariupol on 9 May to celebrate victory over the Nazis in the second world war. Ukraine’s military intelligence said an official from Russia’s presidential administration had arrived in Mariupol to oversee plans for the parade. Britain has banned all export of services to Russia as part of new sanctions against 63 individuals and organisations. The measures, announced by the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, would cut off Russia’s access to the UK’s accounting, management consulting, and PR services. However, it is understood that the measures will not affect the legal profession or some other sectors such as software development and cloud internet services.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 71 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/05/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-71-of-the-invasion
5/5/2022,"Australian households are among the most indebted in the world and the start of interest rate increases by the Reserve Bank will generate “a big potential problem” for many people and the wider economy, a University of New South Wales researcher predicts. Chris Martin, a senior research fellow in UNSW’s City Futures Research Centre, said data from the Bank of International Settlements showed total credit to Australian households amounts to about 120% of annual GDP. That ratio trails only Switzerland’s 130% and was far higher than the average of about 75% for advanced economies. Major banks have already lifted interest rates for mortgages and other loans, matching the RBA’s 0.25 basis point increase on Tuesday. The RBA governor, Philip Lowe, said the cash rate could increase to 2.5% while investors are tipping it will rise to about 3.75% by May 2023. After the surprisingly large RBA rise to 0.35%, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said “we have avoided in Australia … what is happening in those countries”, referring to countries such as Canada and New Zealand which have higher inflation rates than Australia’s 5.1% year-on-year increase recorded in the March quarter. But Martin said Australia’s relatively high household debt load compared with those nations – plus the fact Australia’s inflation rate could still catch up with similar economies elsewhere – increased the risks facing families. “We have a big potential problem courtesy of the way we have run our housing system, for not just the last decade but for the last at least three decades,” Martin said, referring to policies that encouraged people to take on more debt, particularly to purchase investment properties. Each percentage point increase adds on average $323 in monthly repayments, although some cities, such as Sydney are much higher at $486, according to CoreLogic data. Car loans and credit card debt will also be more costly to repay at a time when the price for fuel and many other goods is rising, adding to families’ financial stress, Martin said. “The intense concern about interest rates reflects Australia’s world-beating levels of household debts,” he said. “Our housing system is only weakly governed by real housing policy objectives, that is, ensuring everyone can own or rent a decent affordable home. Instead, it is governed by objectives of wealth creation, and sometimes by concerns about financial system stability.” Such as after the 2015 Murray review into bank risks. Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics released on Wednesday showed investor loans in March for housing rose 2.9% to a record $11.71bn, up almost half from a year ago. Loans taken out by owner occupiers rose 0.9% to $21.57bn, down about 2% from a year earlier. Matthew Hassan, a senior Westpac economist, said the March data would likely “prove to be the high-water mark for this cycle with turnover already off sharply” as the market cools as rates rise. He said property prices are “expected to enter a broad-based and correction phase in coming months that is expected to continue through the rest of 2022, all of 2023 and the first half of 2024”. However, Lowe and market economists don’t see any immediate threat of rising defaults even given Australia’s household debt levels. The RBA governor said after the rate rise on Tuesday households had “squirrelled away” an extra $240bn during the pandemic, and average mortgage repayments were running two years ahead of schedule compared with only one year in 2018. Moreover, the RBA is predicting GDP growth of more than 4% this year before slowing, and the jobless rate is headed toward half-century lows of about 3.5%. Alan Oster, a National Australia Bank senior economist, agreed households were highly exposed to big rate rises but said analysis used by the BIS and others ignored the asset side of the equation. “So, on the net asset to GDP comparison, we are one of the best out there,” he said. “This is not to say it’s not important but the RBA and others know that,” Oster said, adding that “there obviously is a fear that while households will not fall over, they might get scared and stop spending”, denting economic growth. Markets are predicting a particularly steep cash rate increase by the RBA by its July meeting, as part of a ongoing series of increases. #auspol #ausvotes #AusVotes2022 pic.twitter.com/LYpqmzkOuf ANZ’s head of Australian economics, David Plank, said households’ cash buffers do matter. “If you look at household debt after taking into account offset accounts and deposits then it looks much more manageable,” he said. “But debt is high even taking this [buffer] into account and it’s mostly floating or only fixed for the short term. [That’s] why most analysts and the RBA think the cash rate won’t rise as fast here as it will in the US.” Martin predicted that lending conditions aimed at curbing risky borrowing that were loosened to support the economy during the Covid pandemic would have to be tightened again. While buffers may seem large, the average repayment rates masked what would probably be growing numbers of people in financial distress.

The Greens party leader, Adam Bandt, said: “People are in so much debt because incomes are flat, and housing prices are inflated by public tax handouts to wealthy property moguls.” “The debt burden on everyday people will keep getting worse if Liberal and Labor keep giving $6bn a year to the very wealthy to push up house prices,” he said. The Greens would seek to restrict negative gearing to one investment property, scrap the 50% capital gains tax discount and build 1m affordable homes “so that people locked out of the market have a new pathway in,” he said.",News/Australia news,"Laden with ‘world-beating’ debt, Australian households are at increased risk as rates rise, expert says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/05/laden-with-world-beating-debt-australian-households-are-at-increased-risk-as-rates-rise-expert-says
5/5/2022,"Several audience members walked out of a candidates’ forum in the southern Sydney seat of Hughes on Wednesday evening after the maverick MP Craig Kelly labelled mandatory vaccination in workplaces “an abuse of human rights” and “a very dark period in Australia’s history”. Kelly, who quit the Liberal party last year, and is now standing for the United Australia party, said Australia was violating human rights by allowing workplaces to insist on vaccination. “The people who engage in the mandates in this country, forcing other Australians against their free will and without their consent to force them into a medical intervention, are blackmailing people,” he claimed. “It’s unAustralian and against everything we stand for.” Several people in the audience walked out, while other panel members looked perplexed. The Labor candidate, Riley Campbell, suggested voters had much greater concerns. “Be more worried about the cost of living, be more worried about the cost of petrol, whether you can eat,” he said. The race in Hughes is likely to be one of the more colourful and unpredictable of the election. The Liberals, who have held the seat for nearly two decades, named their candidate, Jenny Ware, just days before the campaign was announced. Labor was forced to change candidates at the last minute due to citizenship questions. Two candidates have emerged from the community independents’ movement – Georgia Steele and Linda Seymour – while the Greens are running Peter Thompson and One Nation has chosen Narelle Seymour. Ware was unable to attend the forum due to a prior commitment in the electorate and Narelle Seymour did not respond to the invitation. Climate change, the federal integrity commission, the national disability insurance scheme, public education and aged care dominated the debate. The climate exchange brought a range of views on the reduction target for 2030 – from 50% to 75% – and promises to advance electric car uptake. But Kelly again bucked the trend, claiming that plans to ban coal would play into the hands of the Chinese and undermine Australia’s sovereignty. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Government interference, subsidies forcing us into certain types of generation, it undermines us and plays into China’s hands,” he said. “They are building hundreds of coal-fired power stations. Coal, iron ore and gas bring billions into this nation,” he said. The candidates all agreed that the NDIS needed an overhaul, that more needed to be spent on aged care and a federal Icac was a good idea. The independents also faced questions about their personal voting records in previous elections. Seymour said she had never voted for Kelly while he was the Liberal member for Hughes because of his record of denying the existence of climate change. Steele said she had voted “every which way”. “All these questions are about putting you in a box,” she said. “I consider my vote very carefully. I consider the policies, the qualifications, track record. That’s what I intend to do in the future,” she said. Independents would be part of a powerful crossbench, she said, but if Hughes elected a Liberal or Labor member, that person would be a backbencher for a decade with little sway over party policy.",News/Australia news,Election forum walkouts after Craig Kelly labels vaccine mandates ‘an abuse of human rights’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/05/election-forum-walkouts-after-craig-kelly-labels-vaccine-mandates-an-abuse-of-human-rights
