4/2/2022,"A key city east of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, has been recaptured from Russian forces, Ukrainian officials have said, but retreating troops were said to be heavily mining the lost territory in their wake. The city of Brovary was said by its mayor to have been liberated with Ukrainian forces working to drive out the last Russian troops and clear the area of “military hardware”. The latest success, 12 miles east of Kyiv, came as Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, warned that Russian forces were creating “a complete disaster” by leaving mines on homes and corpses as they retreated. Russia has continued withdrawing some of its ground forces from areas around the capital after saying earlier this week it would reduce military activity near the Ukrainian capital and the northern city of Chernihiv. But in his regular address in the early hours of Saturday, Zelenskiy said the satellite towns around the city were being indiscriminately booby-trapped. He said: “They are mining the whole territory. They are mining homes, mining equipment, even the bodies of people who were killed. There are a lot of trip wires, a lot of other dangers.” Amid reports of missile attacks on the central Ukraine cities of Poltava and Kremenchuk on Saturday morning, Zelenskiy said the Russians were withdrawing “slowly but noticeably”. He pleaded with Russian families not to let their young men sign up for the army as the Kremlin’s annual military conscription drive began. “We don’t need more dead people here. Save your children so they do not become villains. Don’t send them to the army. Do whatever you can to keep them alive. Keep them at home,” he said, adding that he believed Russia was trying to recruit conscripts from Crimea. Ukraine’s military said on Friday it had retaken 29 settlements in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions. But Ukraine and its allies warned that the Kremlin was not de-escalating to promote trust at the bargaining table, as it claimed, but instead resupplying and shifting its troops to the country’s east. Those movements appear to be preparation for an intensified assault on the self-proclaimed republics of the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas in Ukraine’s east, which includes Mariupol. Zelenskiy did not say anything about the latest round of talks, which took place on Friday by video. At a round of talks earlier in the week, Ukraine said it would be willing to abandon an attempt to join Nato and declare itself neutral – Moscow’s chief demand – in return for security guarantees from several other countries. The invasion has left thousands dead and driven more than 4 million refugees from Ukraine. Mariupol, the shattered and besieged southern port city, has seen some of the worst suffering of the war. Its capture would be a major prize for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, giving his country an unbroken land bridge to Crimea, seized from Ukraine in 2014. On Friday, the International Committee for the Red Cross said it was unable to carry out an operation to bring civilians out of Mariupol by bus. City authorities said the Russians were blocking access to the city. “We do not see a real desire on the part of the Russians and their satellites to provide an opportunity for Mariupol residents to evacuate to territory controlled by Ukraine,” Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol’s mayor, wrote on the Telegram messaging app. He said Russian forces were “categorically not allowing any humanitarian cargo, even in small amounts, into the city.” About 100,000 people are believed to remain in the city, down from a prewar 430,000. Weeks of Russian bombardment and street fighting have caused severe shortages of water, food, fuel and medicine. “We are running out of adjectives to describe the horrors that residents in Mariupol have suffered,” said Ewan Watson, a Red Cross spokesperson. On Thursday, Russian forces blocked a 45-bus convoy attempting to evacuate people from Mariupol and seized 14 tons of food and medical supplies bound for the city, Ukrainian authorities said. Zelenskiy said more than 3,000 people were able to leave Mariupol on Friday. He said he discussed the humanitarian disaster with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, by telephone and with the president of the European parliament, Roberta Metsola, during her visit to Kyiv. “Europe doesn’t have the right to be silent about what is happening in our Mariupol,” Zelenskiy said. “The whole world should respond to this humanitarian catastrophe.”",News/World news,Ukraine says it has recaptured city of Brovary but warns of mines left by Russians,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/02/ukraine-says-it-has-recaptured-city-of-brovary-but-warns-of-russian-mines
4/2/2022,"Being a young child never suited me, I wasn’t very good at it. I always wanted a seat at the table and to be heard. Colouring within the lines just isn’t my thing. Scrawling across the page is far more interesting. Mum and I have always got on, my relationship with dad was tricky. He was difficult and dysfunctional. He’d quickly switch from deep darkness to being a bon vivant. It left me walking on eggshells. I went from being outgoing to insular. We lived in London and Cyprus, before settling in East Anglia in the 70s. I was 10 when we arrived in Suffolk. It felt conservative, dark and miserable. Racism was everywhere – names were hurled at me in the street; going to school was an act of bravery. I left at 16, and escaped Bury St Edmunds immediately. Punk saved my life. As a teenager, I ran away from home to see the Clash perform. After school one day, my mate and I hitchhiked across the country. We had the time of our lives and got backstage, until someone asked our age, and everyone scarpered quickly. Neneh Cherry and I fell in love when we met and we’re still best friends decades later. I moved into my cousin’s Stoke Newington squat as a teen, then the two of us connected. We’d both been the odd ones out before. We had the time of our lives dancing, cooking and partying with hip-hop legends. Impatience is a bad habit of mine, although I’m working to improve it with lots of therapy. My head moves faster than my body and wants things done immediately. I’m trying to come off as less pushy. Meeting Shirley Bassey at Wimbledon was a dream. As a child, she’d made me believe a little black girl could do anything, which back then was a rarity. I went over and thanked her, then she politely asked me a question. I was so nervous that I couldn’t talk – all that came out was gobbledegook. She gave me this look, then I apologised and scuttled away, embarrassed. Never tone down who you are. Proudly be your own person. I don’t go to work and put on a character – what you see is what you get. Although in front of the camera I try to be a little less sweary. Always remind yourself that this too shall pass – every painful situation is temporary. After my brother died I was broken and felt my heart would stop beating. Volunteering at an HIV and Aids hospice was part of my healing. Seeing such bravery and people finding joy in small things, helped bring me back. A drunk driver hit me on Finchley Road. I was 26, with a young daughter at home, when a car came flying over the hill and ploughed into me. Thankfully, I flung my body back, leaving only my two legs broken. The driver didn’t even stop to check if they’d killed me. I had my daughter at 20. In a way, we grew up together. Being a single parent working three jobs, with no money or prospects, was tough. I worked hard to build us a future. I’m so proud of her, and us, for getting through it. Don’t trust people who eat dry food. What’s wrong with you? There must, always, be gravy.

4/2/2022,"Robert Kapito, the president of asset management behemoth BlackRock, earns around $20m a year and is worth in the region of $400m. You can buy a lot of fancy trinkets with that kind of money but, alas, it doesn’t seem to purchase much self-awareness. We are in the middle of a cost of living crisis, with low-income households disproportionately affected by the highest inflation in 40 years. People are struggling to heat their homes thanks to surging energy prices and worrying about feeding their families thanks to rocketing food prices. Kapito’s reaction to all this? To complain to a bunch of energy executives about how entitled young people are and how it’s about time they learned a thing or two about how tough life is. “For the first time, this generation is going to go into a store and not be able to get what they want,” Kapito recently said at an energy conference in Texas in reference to inflation. “And we have a very entitled generation that has never had to sacrifice.” It’s not clear which generation 65-year-old Kapito is referring to. But I’d bet all the avocado toast in the world he’s not sneering about his fellow boomers. No, one imagines he means millennials: the generation who famously can’t afford housing because they fritter away all their income on takeaway coffee. The generation who earn 20% less than baby boomers did at the same stage of life despite being better educated. The generation that entered the workforce during a giant recession caused by corporate greed, can’t afford to have kids because it’s too damn expensive, and will be paying off student loans for the rest of their lives. On the one hand, millennials have grown up being able choose from around 45 different types of sugary cereals in a grocery store. On the other hand most millennials will never be able to retire. What’s the word to describe that? Ah, yes, “entitled”. Perhaps I’m being unfair here. Perhaps I misunderstood the reporting on Kapito’s speech. Perhaps his comments about an entitled generation that has never had to sacrifice anything referred to his fellow multimillionaire and billionaire boomers. After all, the obscenely rich never seem to have to sacrifice anything, do they? Inflation certainly won’t keep them up at night worrying about how to keep the lights on: Wall Street bonuses jumped 20% last year with bankers getting an average bonus of $275,500 in 2021. They can afford higher heating bills. The federal minimum wage on the other hand? That stayed at $7.25 an hour, just as it has since 2009. If it rose at the same pace as Wall Street bonuses then it would be $61.75 an hour. If Kapito wants to talk about sacrifice he could do with explaining exactly what he, and people like him, plan to sacrifice. The 1% and corporations don’t seem to be hurting at all right now. Rather, they’ve been boasting about their record profits. Kapito is right about the entitlement problem in the US: we have a very entitled generation of executives who seem to think sacrifice is just for poor people. That’s according to Republican congressman Madison Cawthorn, who recently spread rumours of debauchery in DC and then very quickly walked them back. One does have to wonder what he means by “exaggerated”. Were the orgies only fueled by Red Bull? Were the claims simply a product of an overactive imagination? We may never know. Last year Jeyasre Kathiravel, a 20-year-old Dalit woman, was murdered and allegedly raped by her supervisor at a Tamil Nadu factory making clothes for H&M. Her family said that Kathiravel had been subjected to sexual harassment by the supervisor at work for months but felt powerless to prevent it. Now H&M is signing a legally-binding agreement to try and end sexual violence and harassment against women workers at one of its biggest Indian suppliers. It’s only the second agreement of its kind in the fashion industry, and the first time a brand has signed up to an initiative to tackle gender-based violence in Asia’s garment industry. This is horrific and also depressingly predictable: rape and sexual abuse have long been not just a byproduct of war but a deliberate military strategy. There have been halfhearted attempts to create a male oral contraceptive for a while now but they always seem to come with too many side effects to be considered acceptable. It’s fine for women to deal with things like contraception-induced depression and weight gain but we couldn’t possibly expect men to suffer unnecessarily! Now, however, there’s a promising new non-hormonal pill going into human trials which is expected to have fewer side effects. Whether men will actually take it, however, is another question. Mommy bloggers are doing so apparently. An increasing number of breastmilk jewelers are popping up with names like “Milkies”. Twenty-eight per cent of female factual and staff numbers surveyed by Gallup say they’ve been passed over for advancement at work because of their gender. That’s a bigger share than female workers in the US in general. A team of researchers have said they are very close to creating hypoallergenic cats via the gene-editing technology Crispr. (I found this story on April Fool’s Day and I had to go hunting around the internet for a while to make sure it wasn’t a joke.) I’m not entirely sure why we need to start creating genetically-modified cats instead of just, say, making better antihistamines. Still, I’m glad to see some of the best minds of our generation are working on the really tough questions.

4/2/2022,"Do you find yourself noticing faint sensations that no one else can perceive? Are you startled easily? And is your mood easily swayed by the feelings of the people around you? If so, you may be a highly sensitive person (HSP), a personality profile that is of increasing interest to both scientists and armchair psychologists. As an HSP myself, the trait is most obvious in my embarrassing squeamishness; at the merest hint of violence or pain on TV, I will reflexively cover my eyes with my hands. For other HSPs, their greater sensitivity may be especially evident in an intolerance of strong scents or bright lights, or great discomfort in large crowds. A host of celebrities – including Alanis Morissette, Kanye West, Nicole Kidman and Lorde – have come out as HSPs in the past few years, and the term is increasingly used in the pages of lifestyle magazines and self-help blogs. High sensitivity is often presented as a key contributor to depression and burnout. “A lot of people still think of it in terms of risk and vulnerability,” says Prof Corina Greven of the Radboud University medical centre in the Netherlands. The truth, however, is more complicated. Both high and low sensitivity can have advantages and disadvantages – it all depends on the context. And with a bit of self-knowledge about our place on the spectrum, we can all learn to find the right coping mechanisms to make the most of our personality profile. The idea of a highly sensitive person may seem to recall 19th-century diagnoses of neurasthenia and hysteria, when “rest cures” were frequently prescribed for the overstimulated. The modern interest in HSPs first took root in the mid-1990s, however, with the research of American psychologists Elaine and Arthur Aron. Their aim was to capture someone’s “sensory processing sensitivity” – their excitability in the face of physical, social or emotional stimuli. It didn’t matter whether the nature of the excitement was positive (through, for example, an appreciation of beautiful art or a lively conversation) or negative (through heightened feelings of stress); the point was to learn how forcefully the central nervous system reacted to stimulation. To do so, the researchers designed a series of questions that could be answered on a scale of 1 (not at all) to 7 (extremely). The items included: Do you find yourself needing to withdraw during busy days, into bed or into a darkened room or any place where you can have some privacy and relief from stimulation? When people are uncomfortable in a physical environment do you tend to know what needs to be done to make it more comfortable (such as changing the lighting or the seating)? Do you find it unpleasant to have a lot going on at once? Does being very hungry create a strong reaction in you, disrupting your concentration or mood? Are you deeply moved by the arts or music? The questionnaire is known as the HSP scale and the top 20% were considered to be HSPs. Subsequent research revealed that people’s scores are correlated with measures of introversion – but the differences are large enough that the two traits can be considered distinct. “Not everyone who is highly sensitive will be introverted as well,” says psychologist Dr Charlotte Booth, a research fellow at University College London. In general, people with HSP report being more perceptive across many different domains. They may find it easier to pick out faint sounds that no one else can hear, for example – but they also report being more attuned to others’ needs. As one study participant recently told Greven: “I can just look around the group and immediately spot who is feeling well and who is fighting as a couple, or where there’s tension.” High sensory processing sensitivity also manifests in different thinking styles. “It’s also linked to taking longer to make decisions, greater reflection and enjoying deep conversations over small talk,” Greven says. Eva Pama-van ‘t Zand, a psychologist in the Netherlands, describes it as feeling like a small boat on a lake that is surrounded by larger ships. While others remain steady, you are rocked by the smallest of ripples. At its best, her high sensitivity means that a single smile from a stranger can lift her whole mood: “My experience of the world is richer.” During busy periods, however, the intensity of her feelings can leave her “feverish”. While some cynics may be sceptical of any trait measured through self-report, people’s scores on the HSP scale do seem to reflect objective differences in the brain’s responses to its environment. More sensitive individuals seem to show greater reactivity in the sensory cortices associated with perceptual processing, as well as regions such as the insula and the amygdala that are involved with emotion. Importantly, they also show heightened activity in the prefrontal cortex and other areas that are involved in cognitive tasks such as planning and abstract thinking. Together, these findings would seem to support the claim that HSPs are feeling the world more intensely. According to one recent paper, they are even more likely to experience “autonomous sensory meridian response” – those tingles in response to a whispered voice or the sound of brushing hair. Like other personality traits, sensory processing sensitivity seems to be the product of nature and nurture. In 2020, Prof Michael Pluess of Queen Mary University of London asked 2,868 twins to take a version of the HSP scale designed for adolescents. By comparing the scores of the people who shared the same genetic blueprint and those who did not, he found that around half the variance between individuals could be explained by their genes. It’s not yet clear what those genes may be. One potential candidate is the serotonin transporter gene (often referred to as 5-HTTLPR), which regulates the levels of the neurotransmitter around our synapses. Serotonin is known to modulate mood and attention, and different variants of the gene seem to promote more or less efficient serotonin processing than others – which could have immediate implications for someone’s responses to their environment. Despite some initial excitement, however, the gene’s link to sensory processing sensitivity seems to be relatively weak, and its importance may have been exaggerated. “Most likely, there are many thousands of variations across the genome that together explain a common trait of sensitivity – rather than a single gene,” Pluess says. From the very beginning of the research into sensory processing sensitivity, psychologists have been trying to track the trait’s broader consequences for our long-term wellbeing. “Among those with mental health problems, the number of people with greater sensitivity is disproportionately high,” Pluess says. Subsequent research has shown that the influence of sensory processing sensitivity depends on someone’s circumstances; it is not a universal risk factor. One study from Mary Washington University in the US examined people’s relationships with their parents and their current mental health. It found that high sensitivity significantly increased the chances of developing depression for those who had grown up with poor parental care. For people in loving homes, however, high sensitivity had no effect at all. Booth found similar patterns with a sample of 185 adults from the UK: HSPs who had endured adverse childhood experiences showed much lower life satisfaction later in life, compared with less sensitive people. “They’re much worse affected by negative environments,” she says. Intriguingly, however, HSPs are also more responsive to therapeutic interventions. In 2015, for instance, Pluess studied the effects of a prevention programme, based on cognitive behavioural therapy, that was delivered to schoolchildren at risk of depression over a year. He found that the programme was most effective at reducing depression scores among the children with high sensitivity, while it made little difference to those with low sensitivity. Their increased perceptivity seemed to help them to take on the lessons of the resilience training. Such findings have led some researchers to compare highly sensitive persons to orchids – hothouse flowers that can only thrive when they are nurtured. People with less sensitivity, according to this theory, are more like dandelions – their welfare is generally less dependent on external support. (The people in the middle are sometimes known as tulips.) High sensitivity may be especially relevant in the workplace. In teams with toxic dynamics, highly sensitive persons may be more susceptible to burnout and emotional exhaustion. Even if they are not bullied themselves, they will find their mood more easily shaken by the negative vibes around them. “They will probably pick up more on the tension around them, and find it uncomfortable,” says Pluess. In a nurturing environment, however, greater sensitivity could be a real advantage. There is some evidence that HSPs are better able to pick up on implicit patterns that would escape others’ awareness. This may help them to learn new procedures, without needing someone to explain everything to them. They may also prove to be better listeners and team players, as they consider the needs of their colleagues. Managers should be aware of the trait’s pros and cons during recruitment, says Pama-van ‘t Zand: “It might help them to choose better candidates.” Twenty-five years after the Arons’ invention of the HSP scale, the existence of the trait should now be of little doubt. “We know that there are individual differences in sensitivity to environment,” says Greven. But she argues that we still need more robust research examining the neural mechanisms behind the trait and carefully describing its consequences. With time, it may be possible to identify how psychological interventions could be tweaked to cater for people at different ends of the spectrum. “We could have a personalised approach,” says Pluess. That could include treatments that specifically address the difficulties of high sensitivity – such as the tendency to feel overwhelmed by stress. Equally importantly, we may need new approaches to help people with low sensitivity, who seem to respond less well to traditional psychological interventions and who may need very different forms of support. “You have to think about the other side as well,” says Booth. Personally speaking, I’ve found that the mere knowledge of sensory processing sensitivity, and its influences on our lives, has been enormously instructive. I now understand why I gravitated to a career in writing, where I can happily devote myself to long stretches of concentrated work. Being an HSP has also helped to explain why I am often easily distracted by tiny gestures in social interactions – such as the tone of someone’s voice or a brief change in someone’s facial expression. And – superficially – it means that I need no longer feel embarrassed by my extreme aversion to horror films. There can be room for all kinds of personality types in this world.

Over in Bristol, there’s a gang with a dreamy, doused-in-syrup psych-soul sound that calls to mind Connan Mockasin, Toro y Moi, Khruangbin and Canadian jazz outfit BadBadNotGood, who, incidentally, said that Cousin Kula were very good indeed and reportedly loved the five-piece’s cover of their track, Signal from the Noise. The Kulas met at uni and live together in a house on the outskirts of the city, which you might rightly picture to be like a scene out of Skins, but it’s where the band have very studiously made their recent releases (see it in all its tapestry-hung glory in their Boiler Room live session). Their 2020 lockdown EP Casa Kula Cassette caught the ear of taste-making south London DJ Bradley Zero, who signed last year’s debut album, Double Dinners, to his hip house and jazz label Rhythm Section. Not bad for a band whose track McLovin’ You is named after the uber-nerd in Superbad. It’s one of the standouts on Double Dinners, which is so laid back it sounds like it might fall over, if it weren’t for the slivers of sexy saxophone propping it up. Another key song, Now That You’re Gone, is a magic mushroom of a track, fully sounding as if they’re lost in a psychedelic ooze.

4/2/2022,"Children are having to wait up to five years for an NHS autism appointment, according to figures obtained by the Observer that lay bare the crisis in children’s mental health services. Figures acquired under the Freedom of Information Act show that 2,835 children with autism referrals at Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust have still not had a first appointment an average of 88 weeks after being referred. The longest wait at the time the response was sent in January stood at 251 weeks – nearly five years. Meanwhile, 1,250 children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) referrals at the trust have yet to have a first appointment, having waited an average of 46 weeks – and 195 weeks in the worst case. Berkshire Healthcare NHS Trust has 2,801 children with autism referrals still awaiting their first appointment after 60 weeks on average. Among the 2,443 children with ADHD referrals – who have waited an average of 87 weeks for a first appointment – the longest wait stands at 193 weeks or nearly four years. Across 20 NHS trusts that provided figures, children with outstanding autism referrals have waited nearly six months on average for their first appointment. Cathy Pyle’s daughter, Eva, spent 20 months waiting for an autism assessment from her local NHS child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) in Surrey, having already had to wait 11 months for a mental health assessment after she became increasingly distressed during her first year of secondary school, culminating in self-harm. “The sensory aspects of her autism are really significant,” Pyle told the Observer. “So she found the crowding in the corridors, the jostling, being pushed and shoved – she found the noises really, really unbearable.” The 11-month wait for a mental health assessment was bad enough – she stopped going to school completely by Christmas of her second year and became scared of leaving the house. But the subsequent 20-month wait for an autism assessment, which coincided with the start of the pandemic, saw her condition deteriorate further. “During the first lockdown, it became apparent she had an eating disorder and she was having terrible panic attacks,” said Pyle. She was diagnosed with anorexia and received initial treatment, but the eating disorder team discharged her back to CAMHS as they felt autism was the root problem. The delays in getting a diagnosis meant she could not be placed in a school aimed at autistic children. After the diagnosis her mental health got worse still. “I think she was just so devastated by the fact that people hadn’t recognised it, and it hadn’t been identified in time so that appropriate support could be put in place. And I think that contributed to her falling apart. So she ended up being hospitalised several times over the summer,” said Pyle. Eva is now 15, receives educational and therapeutic provision, and her mental health is improving. Her experience is not unique – Natasha Fletcher’s daughter, Ava, spent a year on the NHS autism diagnosis pathway before they gave up after being told it would take another six months to a year. Fletcher ended up spending thousands of pounds on a private autism diagnosis – from a psychiatrist in the very CAMHS service that had kept her waiting. Dr Rosena Allin-Khan MP, Labour’s shadow cabinet minister for mental health, said: “The NHS does an incredible job with the resources that it has, however, long waits for treatment have a considerable impact on patients and families. It’s unacceptable that a six-month wait has become the standard for autism referrals, with many others waiting years to be seen, on the Conservatives’ watch. Waiting so long for treatment will have a detrimental impact on a child’s development.” A spokesman for Coventry and Warwickshire CCG said: “We acknowledge that our waiting times, particularly for autism and ADHD assessments, are longer than we want. We are investing £5.4m in additional diagnostic capacity.” Berkshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust said it was investing in extra staff and capacity to meet rising referrals levels. A government spokesperson said: “We know how vital it is for children to have timely diagnoses for autism and ADHD and we’re working to improve assessment waiting times. “Supporting neurodivergent children is part of our Long Term NHS Plan – developing packages with charity experts and children’s services to support them throughout the diagnostic process.”",News/Society,Children with autism wait up to five years for an NHS appointment,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/02/children-with-autism-wait-up-to-five-years-for-an-nhs-appointment
4/2/2022,"Wet Leg are a band whose greatest power comes from unexpected contrasts. Their Mona Lisa smiles offset by steely-eyed glee, Rhian Teasdale (most vocals, guitar) and Hester Chambers (other vocals, guitar) paired wholesome bonnets with lobster claws in the video for 2021’s Wet Dream. Earlier this year, they offset a glam rock strop about smartphone anomie – Oh No – with yeti suits made of mop heads. Then there’s the name itself. Former folk-leaning musicians, Teasdale and Chambers seem as though butter would not melt in their mouths. But their name hints at a sloppy mishap with a drink or, worse, of bodily fluids oozing where they shouldn’t. Sex is a topic they dance around savvily and Wet Leg’s initial approach to getting sticky offered something of a wry, absurdist Gen Z update on Carry On. Their debut single, 2021’s Chaise Longue, was full of double entendres. “Is your muffin buttered?” they asked, quoting Mean Girls. “You should be horizontal now.” Chaise Longue’s commitment to a kind of oblique punky breathlessness, meanwhile, recalled both Rock Lobster by the B-52s and Where’s Me Jumper by the Sultans of Ping FC. Going from nought to ubiquitous in a short space of time, Chaise Longue also echoed the previous successes of Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand, Wet Leg’s Domino labelmates. But Wet Leg’s appetite for upending normality also recalls another earlier Domino band, Pavement. The slick of bodily fluids squelching around Wet Leg’s muse was only reinforced by their second release, Wet Dream. But despite some surface roustabout jollity, it took a more fed-up turn. “What makes you think you’re good enough to think about me when you’re touching yourself?” wondered Teasdale in response to some explicit texts from an ex. He’s the kind of guy who’s quite keen to take you home to watch “Buffalo 66 on DVD”. Still, all seemed to bode well for a debut album that satirised all things moist and skewered the icky fantasies of windscreen-licking men. A handful more tracks and now, the full monty, reveals that there seem to be two Wet Legs high-kicking for supremacy: the knockabout, sly, absurdist outfit and a band that turn out to be quite like a lot of other bands. Despite dedicating Wet Leg to not taking themselves too seriously – a song called Supermarket larks about, shopping for bogofs while much the worse for wear – Teasdale and Chambers’s debut album turns out not to be the hoped-for collage of inspired juxtapositions and best friend energy. Rather, it is a tuneful indie rock album about being in your 20s, a conventional record that’s quite happy to lift the guitar line from David Bowie’s The Man Who Sold the World for I Don’t Wanna Go Out. So there’s some disappointment here at this slew of perfectly good, but distinctly un-odd tunes about how terrible it feels to be in love or how confusing it is to be alive (Too Late Now). Expectations sharply managed, Wet Leg’s charm and wit still serve them well. There has, in truth, rarely been a better time to be a female artist with a sharp tongue. From Self Esteem to CMAT via Dry Cleaning, British pop is teeming with clever women flinging zingers about. Teasdale has a good few more up her bouffant calico peasant sleeve. Angelica – about hating a party – is rich with putdowns. “I don’t wanna follow you on the ’Gram/ I don’t wanna listen to your band,” she sighs. Ex-partners come in for particularly quotable tongue-lashings. Teasdale can be blunt or entertainingly specific, conjuring up an entire scene with a few words. “Why don’t you just suck my dick?” she fumes on Ur Mum, shortly before making an exit. “When you’re getting blazed/ Spooning mayonnaise/ Yeah I know it’s time to go.” As she leaves, she takes the metaphorical pin out of a grenade with her teeth and throws it over her shoulder. “Well, if you were better to me then maybe I’d consider fucking you goodbye.” She’s got some terrible lines, too, though: “You’re so woke/ Diet Coke.” Chambers, meanwhile, sings a track called Convincing and makes one last bid for skew-whiffness on a line about swimming at night in “bioluminescent plankton shit”. Conceived at one remove from mainland scenes on the Isle of Wight, Wet Leg’s unself-conscious art seemed initially to foreground the ridiculousness of everything (especially weird stains). Their album, by contrast, drills down hard into how rubbish exes are. Relatable, of course, understandable too, but perhaps not what was originally indicated by those lobster claws.",Arts/Music,Wet Leg: Wet Leg review – absurdist delights and damp squibs,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/02/wet-leg-wet-leg-review-absurdist-delights-and-damp-squibs
