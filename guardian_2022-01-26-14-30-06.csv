1/26/2022,"Acast of hundreds has descended on the farm fields in midwinter. Out in the winter wheat, a rowdy assortment of crows behave like gatecrashers at a party where the booze has already run out. Trampling their restlessness over the first leaves of grass, cawing and wing-flapping, they claw at chilled soil where frost-averse invertebrates are dead, dormant or deep below. The crows don’t stay long. The hedge alongside is bare of berries and bursting with birds. Bush to bush, twig to twig, a flock of chaffinches is whipped along by “pink pink” exclamations, and their speed-foraging seems too fast for them to glean anything worthwhile out of split-second pauses. Some spill out over the ground beside, and pick over earth that has been picked over by innumerable beaks before. Within seconds, the whole band – maybe 50-strong – has abandoned cover and struck out across the fields.  An even bigger group of linnets drop into the hedge top, using the barrier only as a staging and perhaps regrouping post. They, too, move on into open country, searching seed banks that haven’t been replenished in months. Watching these itinerant flocks come and go is another traveller, a mute local whose horizons have shrunk to the end of a stick. Most birdwatchers know it as a voice of the uplands, its persistent flint-knapping call giving rise to its name. The stonechat has left its rocks on the moors and cliffs to endure the colder months here in silence. But like most of the stonechats that migrate to Bedfordshire, it has brought company. The roaming pair occupy a small niche – in three or four months, I’ve never seen them more than a half mile from here. An endearing “there’s one, where’s the other?” constant along the hedges and drainage ditches, they are always a short distance apart, always poised at the tip of a dead stem. I know this big-headed bird on the hedge by its relentless fidgeting, twisting this way and that, flicking its tail. The tiny in search of the minute, it ekes out an existence here by being alert to grab at any little scrap of life.

1/26/2022,"The mobile phones of a senior Human Rights Watch staff member are alleged to have been repeatedly hacked by a client of NSO Group at a time when she was investigating the catastrophic August 2020 explosion that killed more than 200 people in Beirut. The alleged hacking of Lama Fakih, a US-Lebanese citizen and director of crisis and conflict at HRW, marks the latest example of how NSO’s powerful surveillance tool, Pegasus, has been used by the company’s clients to target campaigners and journalists.  HRW said that Fakih had been alerted by Apple on 24 November 2021 that her personal iPhone could be under state-sponsored attack. An investigation by HRW’s security team, which was reviewed by Amnesty International’s Security Lab, found that Fakih’s iPhones had apparently been infected with Pegasus through a so-called “zero-click” exploit that allows operators of the spyware to infect a phone without the mobile user doing anything, such as clicking on a link. The news comes as NSO has faced a raft of bad news at home and abroad. In November, the company was placed on a US blacklist by the Biden administration, which said it had evidence that the Israeli company was enabling foreign governments to conduct “transnational repression”. NSO has also been engulfed in a domestic crisis in Israel after it was alleged in a report by Calcalist that the Israeli police had used Pegasus to gather intelligence for investigative purposes without legal oversight. The report prompted Israel’s attorney general Avichai Mendelblit to announce a probe into police use of the spyware against Israelis. NSO said in a statement in response to the report that it had no control over how its clients used the spyware. On Tuesday, NSO’s chairman, Asher Levy, said he was stepping down as chairman of the company but denied that the move had any connection to the recent developments. Levy said he had been appointed to the role by NSO’s previous private equity owners, but that management of the fund that owns the company had been transferred to a new company. “Any attempts to present this move as a present-day resignation as a result of any publication related to NSO are completely false,” Levy said. “I am full of appreciation to NSO, the life-saving technology it develops, the company’s management and employees, and the unprecedented ethical policies that the company has adopted.” In a statement on Tuesday, NSO said it was a “profitable company” and that it believed an international regulatory structure ought to be put in place to ensure the responsible use of cyber intelligence tools. “However, any call to suspend these life-saving technologies until such a structure exists is naive and would only benefit the terrorists, pedophiles and hardened criminals who will evade surveillance and apprehension,” the spokesperson said. NSO declined to respond to the Guardian’s questions about Fakih’s case but the company told HRW that it was “now aware of any active customer using [its] technology against a Human Rights Watch staff member” and that it would open an initial assessment into allegations that Fakih had been hacked. When it is successfully deployed, a user of Pegasus spyware can intercept phone calls, see a target’s photographs, read their messages, and turn the phone into a remote listening device. NSO has said that its clients are only meant to use the spyware to target serious suspected criminals. HRW alleged that its analysis found that Fakih’s two devices had been hacked between 6 April 2021 and 23 August 2021. The human rights group could not identify the client who may have been responsible for the alleged hacking but said Fakih oversees crisis response from countries including Israel/Palestine, Kazakhstan, Ethiopia, Syria, Myanmar, Lebanon, Afghanistan and the US. In an interview with the Guardian, Fakih said the issue she was most intently working on an investigation of the “Beirut blast” at the time when she was allegedly hacked. She was also involved in projects involving Gaza and Ethiopia in that time. “I was working around the clock,” she said, adding that she’d created a “Beirut blast” folder on her shared drive on 5 April, a day before the alleged attacks began. “I have always been very cautious about my physical security…but I never had anything happen that led me to believe that I was compromised in some way, that my data was being hacked or that things were being leaked,” she said. “So when I did receive this notification from Apple there was a certain amount of disbelief that this had happened to me,” she added. Fakih, a native of Michigan, said she had always taken pains to keep her personal life private and protect the privacy of people she communicated with in her work. “And then suddenly, I have my phone infected. So I have thousands of photos of my young kids or photos of my wedding and all these deeply personal and meaningful memories that suddenly were not mine. And that made me feel very insecure,” she said. “My entire career has been about trying to protect people’s rights. And suddenly they were trying to use that work to undermine them.”",News/News,Top Human Rights Watch investigator allegedly hacked with Pegasus spyware ,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/jan/26/human-rights-watch-investigator-allegedly-hacked-with-pegasus-spyware-
1/26/2022,"Can the western alliance against Russia over its buildup of troops on the Ukrainian border hold together? It is a question that politicians and diplomats are increasingly grappling with amid fears that Germany and, to a lesser extent, France are in danger of dividing from the US and the UK, not only over how to respond to any future Russian act of aggression in Ukraine, but also in their assessment of the imminence of the threat. Every effort is being made to minimise the differences within the Nato alliance, including through regular calls such as the one led by Joe Biden on Monday, but they may be impossible to avoid since they reflect not just different short-term assessments on intelligence, but a deep fissure going back decades about what Germany and France, as opposed to the Anglosphere, regard as the best way to handle Russia.  France, looking at the same intelligence provided by the CIA, does not see an imminent invasion, or a gathering of forces equipped to invade in the next three weeks – an assessment shared by the best Ukrainian defence analysts. In Britain, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has been openly critical of Germany for leaving itself so dependent on Russia for energy, and Berlin’s recent refusal to allow Estonia to send German-manufactured arms to Ukraine. The idea of Germany providing weapons to be used against Russia for the first time since the second world war is anathema. Speaking in Berlin on Tuesday, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, defended the decision, saying it was rooted “in the whole development of the past years and decades”. In Poland, the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said in a Facebook post that he remained concerned by the block on Estonia. In the US, the German question is increasingly riling Republicans, leading to commentary in the Wall Street Journal with the headline “Is Germany a Reliable American Ally? Nein.” The tensions reflect two different interpretations of how, even now, Russia can be prevented from becoming a force hostile to the west, interpretations that have dominated politics after the cold war. The differing assessments in Berlin, Washington, Paris and London of how to construct something stable out of the rubble of post-Soviet Russia have always been in flux, with different capitals taking different views at different points. The US under Bill Clinton was as reluctant as anyone to let the four Visegrád countries – the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia – into Nato and made his belief about the risks absolutely clear at the organisation’s summit in January 1994, saying the Atlantic Alliance could not “afford to draw a new line between east and west that would create a self-fulfilling prophecy of future confrontation”. Tony Blair also had to be disabused that Britain could lure Putin into the western camp, and was an enthusiastic supporter of Russia joining the G8. Boris Johnson visited Moscow as foreign secretary in 2017 and, despite the Salisbury poisoning, has been extraordinarily lax about Russian money in London. France too has blown hot and cold in the wake of Russia’s occupation of Crimea in March 2014. It was only after sustained American pressure that François Hollande cancelled a £1bn contract signed by his predecessor as French president to sell to Russia mistral-class helicopter gunships bound for the annexed Black Sea ports in Crimea. Emmanuel Macron invited Putin to Versailles alongside an exhibition about Peter the Great in May 2017. Faced by Trump’s isolationism, Macron, in a major speech in 2019, called for an end to the “frozen conflicts” with Russia. In June last year, in conjunction with Angela Merkel, he blindsided other EU leaders by offering Putin a summit. In Berlin on Tuesday, the French president said he was still planning to talk to the Russian leader this week, but only about de-escalation. However, the central player in Europe’s relations with Russia is Germany, as it has been since unification. Quite why Germany takes such a stubbornly forgiving, or optimistic approach to Putin fills libraries, and the most recent offering titled Germany’s Russia Problem, written by John Lough, details the full extent of the networks – commercial, political, cultural and intellectual – between German and Russian elites. It also explains how Putin plays on German war guilt and refuses to repay German forgiveness. The examples Lough raises include how in the wake of Russia’s intervention in Georgia in the summer of 2008, the then German Social Democrat (SPD) foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, warned Europe against sanctions that he said would shut doors to rooms it wanted to enter later. Although Merkel’s response to the invasion of Ukraine in 2014 was firm, Steinmeier, sure that the SPD understood Russia better than Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party, went to Moscow and proposed an economic partnership with Russia. At the same time, three former chancellors of Germany – Helmut Schmidt, Gerhard Schröder and Helmut Kohl – all warned Merkel not to isolate Moscow. Within a week of the invasion, the chief executive of Siemens was in Moscow. As the diplomatic situation worsened, a group of senior German former officials and politicians sent an emotional letter calling for a return to the policy of detente. This German-Russian relationship, a recent Chatham House paper argues, has been shaped by two factors. First, Ospolitik, which refers to the “change through rapprochement” foreign policy strategy towards the Soviet Union and its satellite states that was pursued in the 1970s by the Social Democrat chancellor Willy Brandt, and that tried to overcome hard lines by focusing on joint interests. The policy is still considered by many to be the way forward., Second, the mutual dependence deal between the two countries that dates from the 1970s, when the Soviet Union and Germany agreed to exchange natural gas from the USSR for German pipes and steel. It is premised on the belief expressed by Schmidt that “those who trade with each other do not shoot each other”. By 2018 Germany accounted for 37% of Gazprom sales, and the Nord Stream 2 pipeline had been agreed. German exports to Russia rose fivefold between 2000 and 2011. That remains the dominant thinking inside parts of the SPD. The current economics minister, Robert Habeck, whose ministry is responsible for sanctions, is opposed to cutting off Russian access to the Swift payments system. He told Der Spiegel: “We should think about new areas of business that can help lead both sides out of the confrontational role.” However, in recent weeks the compromises inherent in Ostpolitik have come under challenge from a younger generation. Michael Roth, the SPD chair of the foreign affairs committee, argued his party had to escape the shadow of Brandt, adding “we cannot dream the world to be better than it is”. Other ministers have insisted that energy, including the future of Nord Stream 2, cannot be removed from the list of potential sanctions, as it was in 2014. All this leaves Scholz in a different position with his US interlocutors, none of it made easier by his alliance with a Green foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, who wishes to inject values into German foreign policy. The SPD, to avoid a public split, is now going to have a formal party debate about its approach to Russia. One diplomat pointed to the relevance of a remark by Alexander Solzhenitsyn just as the Soviet Union disintegrated, who warned about how perilous it might prove to manage the breakup of the empire. “The clock of communism has stopped striking. But its concrete building has not yet come crashing down,” he wrote. For that reason, the task ahead was not yet about “freeing ourselves”, but instead “to try to save ourselves from being crushed by its rubble”.",News/World news,Why are Germany and France at odds with the Anglosphere over how to handle Russia?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/nato-allies-policy-russia-ukraine-analysis
1/26/2022,"Roberto Saviano has said he felt compelled to speak up against anti-migration policies as he faces a defamation trial over remarks accusing Italy’s far-right leaders of a lack of compassion towards people dying at sea. Saviano, the author of Gomorrah, for which he infiltrated the mafia – he has been in hiding from them since 2006 – will stand trial later this year for calling the Brothers of Italy leader, Giorgia Meloni, a “bastard” after she said NGO boats that had attempted to rescue refugees should be sunk.  Her action came after the author was asked on the political TV chat show Piazzapulita for a comment on the death of a six-month-old baby from Guinea following a tragic shipwreck in the central Mediterranean. Including in his remarks the leader of the far-right Northern League, Matteo Salvini, who as interior minister introduced a decree imposing fines of up to €50,000 on NGO rescue boats bringing people to Italy, Saviano said: “I just want to say to Meloni, and Salvini, you bastards! How could you have?” Meloni – who had said: “We have to repatriate the migrants back to their countries and then sink the boats who rescued them” – sued Saviano for criminal defamation and a judge in Rome ruled that the writer should be tried. “I’m sick of witnessing this disgusting profiteering by Saviano,” she said after his TV appearance. “Is it normal that this serial hater is allowed to defame, without the right to reply, people who are not present on the talk show? I have already asked my lawyers to proceed with a legal action against him.” Saviano, 42, gave his version of events to the Guardian: “During the broadcast I was asked to comment on a video, showing a mother who had just lost her newborn son in the waves. Next to the desperate woman, just rescued, there was another six-year-old boy, vomiting seawater. He is sitting almost in a trance.” The writer says his “discomfort surrounding the way in which migrants are treated by politicians has lasted for years”. “Everything has got worse since 2017 when the current foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, in a post on Facebook, defined the NGO rescue boats as ‘sea taxis’,” he said. “I could not believe my eyes. It did not seem possible that a politician could have defined those ships, which are real ambulances of the sea, as taxis. They began to say that NGOs were on the payroll of powerful people who wanted to destabilise Europe, by using Italy as a gateway. “Credit and space began to be given to raving theories. Prosecutors began to investigate NGOs and impound their ships. To me, this all seemed absurd.” Saviano argues that very few intellectuals and writers stood up then against what was described as the criminalisation of NGOs. “I deluded myself that fellow writers and newspapers would become indignant regarding this injustice,” Saviano said. “But, instead, no. Very few dared and still dare to oppose the lie of the invasion, from Africa, of foreigners who come to steal work from Italians. And this guilty silence led, in the years in which Matteo Salvini was at the ministry of the interior, to a marked worsening, both in the management of shipwrecks at sea and in the lives of foreigners who have resided in Italy for years, working and paying taxes. “Just listen to the Italian children of parents of foreign origin who have attended schools here, but who, due to an absurd law, must wait until they turn 18 before being considered Italian citizens. If you talk to them, they will tell you about a worsening of their lives, a more or less latent racism that makes the lives of many very difficult … If those in charge of the institutions do not show respect for foreigners, how can the people be expected to do so?” He added: “That’s why my anger is without calculation. Most likely, fewer people will look for my books, because they will consider me divisive, yet I can’t help myself: anyone who doesn’t believe that rescue boats are saving lives doesn’t deserve respect. Words are important.” Few people know more than Saviano how important words are, given that, because of Gomorrah, the writer’s devastating denunciation of the Neapolitan mafia and a world bestseller, he is forced to live under guard due to threats received from mobsters, emerging only under police escort. For 15 years, the writer has not spent more than a few nights in the same place, and often sleeps in police barracks. He cannot go out alone, take a stroll in busy places or go to the sea. Saviano said: “I have no power except that of the words I pronounce, words that are not guaranteed to convince those who listen to me. If I am sentenced, I will respond to my words, but I will never regret having lost my peace of mind and perhaps even many readers for defending the voiceless.”",News/World news,Roberto Saviano to go on trial accused of defaming Italian far-right leader,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/roberto-saviano-trial-accused-defaming-italian-far-right-leader
