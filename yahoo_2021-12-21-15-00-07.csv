12/21/2021,"An earthquake that measured 6.2 in magnitude off the coast of California could be felt as far inland as Redding early Monday afternoon. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake happened at about 12:10 p.m. about 24 miles west of Petrolia in Humboldt County. Petrolia is about 50 miles south of Eureka. The quake was one of a cluster of some 24 quakes that ranged from less than 3.0 in intensity to more than 6.0. The first quake hit shortly before 7 a.m. about 13 miles west of Petrolia and registered 4.0 in intensity, according to the USGS. The most recent quake happened shortly before 2 p.m. about northeast of Petrolia and registered 3.8, the USGS said. See this database on earthquakes. The Humboldt County Sheriff's Office said there were numerous smaller aftershocks recorded around Petrolia, Ferndale, Shelter Cove and Rio Dell. ""There is no threat of tsunami at this time,"" the Humboldt sheriff's office said. Some roads in Humboldt County had been closed due to damage from the quakes, the sheriff's office said, those included Redwood Drive between Evergreen Road and Bear Canyon Road due to a rockslide; and Mattole Road near Postmile 11 due to rockslide. Kaitlin Graves, who works at the Petrolia General Store, said there didn't appear to be any serious damage from the quake. Other reports around town were similar, with no serious damage, she said. Some items had fallen from store shelves, though. ""Yes, there are broken wine bottles and other products â€” one of them very stinky. It smells really funky in here now. Yeah, so my pantry at home is all messed up,"" Graves said. She said she had just stepped outside the store when the earthquake hit. ""Well, you know, I was out back taking a break, smoking a joint, and that's when it hit for me. My coworker was inside the store and she went out and I just rode it out outside. That's my first outside earthquake and I've lived in Humboldt my whole life,"" Graves said. She was a little shook up from the quake, so she ran over to the postmaster, which shares the same building, and gave her a hug, Graves said. While Petrolia was near the epicenter of numerous quakes Monday, there was some building shaking that occurred in Redding as a result of the largest quake that hit shortly after noon. Don Bader, the area manager for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, initially said the effects of the quake were not felt strongly enough in the area north of Redding to trigger an inspection of Shasta Dam. But due to ongoing aftershocks, the bureau added Shasta Dam to its inspection list, he said. Bureau officials also planned to inspect three other dams in the area that are managed by the agency, he said. Those dams are Whiskeytown, Trinity and Buckhorn Dam, a small structure on Grass Valley Creek in Trinity County. ""It did not affect Shasta Dam to any point that we need to worry about it, but Trinity Dam and Whiskeytown Dam, we're going to go out and do field inspections because the (effects) are just on the threshold of us needing to go and do inspections, so we're going to go out of precaution,"" Bader said. With ""embankment dams you're always looking for some erosion out of the ordinary. We look at our facilities, our gate structures and everything else. We do these monthly inspections, but it's kind of like a repeat of that but out of concern of the earthquake, though, of course,"" Bader said. Officials with the California Department of Transportation said there were no reports of damage to any of the state highways in Humboldt, Trinity or Shasta counties. Josh Hoines, superintendent at Whiskeytown National Recreation Area, said he felt the earthquake hit. ""I felt it here in my office, but I haven't heard of any reports of damage,"" Hoines said. Hoines said he had become accustomed to earthquakes when he was working in Southern California, but since he moved to the North State three years ago, quakes are less common here. He said it took him a few seconds to realize he was feeling an earthquake. ""You know it had a little bit of a bump and some sway to a lamp here. The pieces of it were swaying back and forth and rattling,"" Hoines said.

12/21/2021,"By David Brunnstrom and Kanishka Singh WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Monday named Under Secretary of State Uzra Zeya as special coordinator for Tibet, drawing a warning from China to stay out of its internal affairs. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Zeya, who is responsible for democracy and human rights, would lead U.S. efforts to preserve the Chinese-ruled territory's religious, cultural, and linguistic heritage in the face of human rights abuses by Beijing. Beijing has consistently refused to deal with a U.S. coordinator on Tibet and China's Washington embassy on Monday denounced the move as ""political manipulation."" ""The U.S. should stop interfering in China's internal affairs or destabilizing Tibet under the pretext of Tibet-related issues. China will take all necessary measures to safeguard our interests,"" embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu said in an email, without elaborating. Blinken said Zeya would also seek to promote dialogue between China and Tibet's spiritual leader in exile, the Dalai Lama, or democratically elected Tibetan leaders. ""She will lead U.S. efforts to preserve the religious, cultural, and linguistic heritage of Tibetans who are facing human rights abuses and challenges to their livelihoods and environment,"" Blinken said in a tweet. China reacted angrily last year and accused the United States of seeking to destabilize Tibet after the administration of former U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Zeya's predecessor to the same role. U.S.-China relations have been at their lowest point in decades over a range of issues, including trade, Taiwan, human rights, the South China Sea and the coronavirus. China seized control of Tibet after its troops entered the region in 1950 in what it calls a ""peaceful liberation."" Tibet has since become one of the most restricted areas in the country. Critics, led by the Dalai Lama, say Beijing's rule amounts to ""cultural genocide"". The International Campaign for Tibet advocacy group welcomed Zeya's new role and in an emailed statement its interim president Bhuchung Tsering urged Zeya to take the lead in gathering support from like-minded countries to formulate a common approach on Tibet, as mandated by the Tibetan Policy and Support Act passed in the United States last year.
