4/17/2022,"From the opening whistle to the last, Leicester’s home supporters lapped up the spectacle. Sure it was scrappy, sure both teams coughed up several opportunities, and sure, this wasn’t exactly rugby at its most organised. But it was entertaining. And judging by the volume of the crowd, and the number of ‘ooohs’ and ‘aaahs’ they emitted, they were enjoying themselves under blue east Midlands skies. On that they differed with Leicester’s coach Steve Borthwick who, as Ellis Genge revealed, gave his team a “bollocking”. This was the antithesis of Borthwick-ball which is characterised by a ruthlessness in the red zone, discipline at set-piece and an efficiency at the breakdown. To give them their dues, they were commanding in defence as white waves routinely crashed on green and red rocks. “At half-time there were things we needed to do better,” Borthwick said, understandably emphasising the result rather than the display. “At the start of the season, who’d have thought that Leicester Tigers would be European Champions Cup quarter-finalists? You’d think there’d be no chance of that.” George Ford was bullish in his appraisal of Leicester’s style earlier this week, perhaps reflecting a sentiment in the camp that they’re not getting the love they feel they deserve. If any critics are among the Leicester faithful, they would surely hope their team revert back to type for the home quarter final against Leinster next month. They started this one on the back foot, spending the opening six minutes defending in their own 22. When they got the ball, a slick move left then right saw them maraud into Clermont territory and win a penalty. Ford punted it into touch and that well-drilled line-out brought it down. Several dominant phases later Hanro Liebenberg crashed through a tackle and stretched to score. Clermont attacked with desperation with the 18-year-old scrum-half Baptiste Jauneau a constant presence. But Leicester’s defence was immense, belying their scoreboard comfort, prompting Camille Lopez to take three points when given the option. The remaining 25 minutes of the first half was filled with intent but lacked precision when it mattered. Jauneau stepped out while bringing the ball down in the try area. Chris Ashton knocked on while sliding to collect Jack van Poortvliet’s kick. Yohan Beheregaray fumbled Jauneau’s low pass with nothing but space in front of him. So the score remained 7-3 in Leicester’s favour. Borthwick is not one to divulge the content of his locker-room rants, but his intentions were made clear when he replaced youngsters Nic Dolly and van Poortvliet with Charlie Clare and Ben Youngs. A scrum penalty soon after was slotted by Ford. Though correlation doesn’t equal causation, those substitutions saw Leicester rediscover their accuracy. Ford ignited a move down the left that was finished by a hot-stepping Matt Scott. Clermont were enthusiastic but uninspired with ball in hand but they did cross the line in the corner through Alivereti Raka. That merely tugged the tiger’s tail. The Premiership leaders romped up field and forced a yellow card for Etienne Fourcade near the line. Tommy Reffell lost the ball attempting to ground but his slip was immaterial as Daniel Bibi Biziwu’s infringement led to a penalty try as well as another yellow card. It was 14 against 13 when Ollie Chessum was shown red for a high tackle on Samuel Ezeala. Leicester exploited the extra space by scoring a stunner from distance. Youngs broke off a scrum in his own 22, dummied, passed to the dancing Harry Potter who in turn set up Freddie Steward. Fritz Lee ran a wonderful line to notch an impressive score of his own, but the game, and the tie, which ended with a 56-27 aggregate score, had long since been settled.",Sport/Sport,Steve Borthwick lifts Leicester to quarter-final showdown with Leinster,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/16/leicester-clermont-european-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report
4/17/2022,"The Australian Electoral Commission and Facebook have voiced alarm at a bubbling campaign from minor party candidates raising baseless claims about election fraud or ballots being altered, warning of “dangerous” voter integrity misinformation being imported from the United States. The AEC said it has successfully applied to Facebook to take action against misinformation in the lead-up to the election, with at least five posts removed and two pages being taken down entirely. Candidates from One Nation, United Australia party and other micro parties have begun seeding Facebook with advice to supporters tinged with claims about ballots being erased, amended or hidden. Facebook posts recommend people bring pens to the ballot box instead of using pencils, to sign a statutory declaration about their vote, and even to take photo or video proof of their ballots. Reignite Democracy is a political action group that began as an anti-lockdown organisation, and last year announced a collaboration with the UAP. In February, the group wrote on its website “Take a video and/or photo of your completed ballot paper”, citing claims of “voter rigging or misconduct”. “Use a pen when you vote. This will ensure that your vote is valid and cannot be changed,” wrote Liz Suduk, One Nation’s endorsed candidate for the seat of Blair, on 6 April. Other previous and current One Nation candidates have shared these posts to their followers. Suduk also told followers they should sign stat decs “should counting go amiss”. “We sign a stat dec and give it to the polling booth operators so we can contest the election results if we deem them to be untrustworthy,” wrote United Australia candidate Jason Olbourne, in the seat of Paterson, on 9 April. The official page for One Nation’s Victorian state branch, with 12,000 followers, told fans on 6 April to use a pen and sign stat decs. Quinton Cunningham, UAP’s Blair candidate, wrote on 9 April “voter security is more important than ever”. In all cases, these pages and other related candidates posted what appeared to be copy-pasted pro forma dot points, with near-identical recommendations. The AEC said it was monitoring growing misinformation claims spreading online around voter integrity. The AEC is concerned at this conversation being “imported” from America, following widespread baseless claims about voter fraud in Donald Trump’s 2020 presidential election loss. “While many of the posts simply encourage people to ‘bring a pen’ and ‘fill in a stat dec’, the inference often being made is that the counting process is somehow subject to manipulation. This is simply not the case,” an AEC spokesman told Guardian Australia. “Such communication is dangerous and little different to what has been seen overseas recently.” The AEC said people were welcome to bring pens to mark ballots and/or to fill in a stat dec – “but our polling officials will not be receiving them – that is not part of our processes”. “Ballot paper security, and electoral integrity more broadly, is a central component to our operations. Ballot papers are secured and tracked from the moment a voter puts them into a ballot box,” the spokesman said. He detailed the high level of security that ballot papers were subject to, including security guards, transparent boxes being locked with barcoded cable ties and never left alone with any one person, and police checks of supervisors. “Australians can feel confident that their ballot paper will be counted according to the preferences they mark,” the AEC said. Olbourne, UAP’s Paterson candidate, did not resile from his posts when contacted by Guardian Australia. He claimed he was “listening to the voters who have been left out of the political process”. When asked if he believed this election would experience voter fraud, Olbourne replied: “The concerns of the people are legitimate. All voices ought to be heard.” Glenn West, campaign manager for Cunningham, said he and the candidate had “only experienced high integrity from AEC staff” and never experienced voter integrity issues. He claimed Cunningham’s Facebook posts were reaching out to people in the community who “think the AEC is corrupt”, but admitted some of those people “are maybe caught up in the US politics”. “Some of the posts we’ve got up are to address those that would question the integrity,” West said. Elise Thomas, analyst with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, said voter fraud rhetoric “imported” from the US had been growing in Australia for months. “There’s a bunch of candidates laying the ground for this election fraud narrative, you can see it coming,” she said. “They haven’t solidified around any narrative on exactly how they claim it will be stolen, other than claiming the system is corrupt. It makes it harder to debunk, because there’s no specific allegation to counter … this formless accusation means it’s easy to make it sound scary.” A Facebook spokesperson said while posts about using pens or stat decs didn’t violate the platform’s community standards, it was on the lookout for election misinformation. “We encourage people to report anything they see on our platforms that may violate our policies so we can review it and take appropriate action,” they said. A spokesperson for the AEC said the agency had referred eight misinformation matters, including Reignite Democracy Australia, to Facebook for action. “For five of those matters, Facebook had the post removed. For two of the matters they removed the page and for the remaining one matter they did not take action as their assessment said it wasn’t covered under their policies,” they said. Separately, the AEC applied to Meta for action against an independent candidate who failed to include appropriate authorisation on his page, even before he had completed his nomination paperwork. Stuart Bonds, an independent for the seat of Hunter who ran for One Nation at the last election, said he was left in the dark about the reasons his page was blocked in Australia. His page was taken down after the AEC contacted Meta – Facebook’s parent company – about the lack of authorisation on the page. The AEC said it contacted Meta after being unable to contact Bonds, and said officially being a candidate was not “necessarily the determining factor” as to whether or not communication was deemed to require an authorisation. “One of the major tests for whether or not something requires an authorisation is if its purpose is to influence how someone will cast their vote,” a spokesperson said. “This isn’t limited to the election period let alone whether nominations have closed. “Contacting people to have an appropriate authorisation applied, or the communication ceased, is always the first step with authorisations matters. If we receive no reply then we may engage online platforms to seek them to take action. This is what occurred on this occasion.”A spokesperson for Meta said the company’s community standards outlined what was and was not allowed on Facebook. “These standards apply to both organic content and advertisements, and cover topics that may be implicated in the context of voting and elections,” she said. “For content that doesn’t breach our rules but may breach Australian electoral laws, we will review requests from the Australian Electoral Commission and take appropriate action.”",News/Australia news,AEC alarmed at ‘dangerous’ voter fraud claims spreading before Australian election,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/17/aec-alarmed-at-dangerous-voter-claims-spreading-before-australian-election
4/17/2022,"The Norwegian designers of the MM130 call it a “revolutionary” vessel. The first of 14 hydrogen-powered cruise ships – 130 metres long, 22 metres wide, six decks high and with the ability to carry 300 passengers and 100 crew – is due to hit the water in 2025. It would be a significant engineering milestone for an industry that contributes an unknown but not trivial amount to the 940m tonnes of CO2 generated by marine transport each year, or roughly 2.5% of global emissions. The chief executive of Northern Xplorer, Rolf Sandvik, says the vessel will be entirely sustainable and emissions-free on the day it leaves the dock. “We fully intended to use green hydrogen from our first day of operation,” Sandvik says. “We did not consider the use of any other kind of cleaner fuel derived from fossil fuels, such as LNG. “Huge steps are being taken in the formation of a hydrogen supply chain ecosystem in Norway. The build-up of both hydrogen and marine battery production is robustly backed by the goodwill of the Norwegian authorities.” The Norwegian government has limited the number of calls that can be made to world heritage-protected fjords and imposed zero-emissions requirements on vessels that do so from 2026. That stands in stark contrast to Australia, where the industry is expected to come roaring back to life after a two-year pause prompted by what the Australian Cruise Association described as an “ultra-conservative approach to the pandemic and desire to eliminate the virus from our country”. International cruise ships are allowed to return from Sunday, and Australian authorities have thrown the doors open even wider than before, with plans to open up destinations such as Eden on the New South Wales south coast to some of the world’s largest vessels, capable of carrying up to 6,700 passengers. Under the Port Authority of NSW’s expansion plans, a curfew on ships docking at Eden between 10pm and 7am would be lifted, and there would be no restrictions on how many ships could visit. Meanwhile in Queensland, the new Brisbane International Cruise Terminal, dubbed the “ghost terminal” after it was abandoned in 2020 without having accepted a single ship, will open in June as part of plans for 140 visits a year at Queensland ports. The scale of this return has raised questions about sustainability and whether an opportunity has been missed to transition to a zero-carbon industry. During the downtime, authorities in some places have worked to resolve pressing environmental problems. In March, the Port Authority of NSW announced it would install a $60m ship-to-shore power system at the White Bay terminal in Sydney Harbour, after a 10-year campaign by residents against the fumes created by idling ships. Hooking cruise ships up to a power source on land while they are docked means they do not have to run auxiliary engines to keep their electrical systems running. The system will be operational by 2024 and is expected to be powered entirely by renewable energy, which the Port Authority predicts will stop 14,000 tonnes of CO2 from entering the atmosphere every year. The local state MP, Jamie Parker of the Greens, told the Inner West Review that having cruise ships running their engines 24/7 was “like having 2,000 cars pumping out toxic exhaust straight into homes”. “Sydney has been a dumping ground for the cruising industry’s oldest and dirtiest cruise ships – vessels that wouldn’t even be allowed to enter most ports in the northern hemisphere,” Parker says. The announcement, he said, had “catapulted Sydney from being the laggard of the international cruising industry to being a world leader exhibiting environmental best practice”. But other communities are not as sanguine about the return of the industry. Penny Davidson, from the Jervis Bay Community Cruiseship Coalition on the NSW south coast, says residents are still waiting to find out whether the pristine bay will be added as a destination. “The last two years would have been an ideal time to have sorted this out and to have thought thoroughly about how we can protect our marine parks and support any additional tourism if the marine park can sustain that,” Davidson says. “When it starts back up, the momentum will have started and the industry will obviously be lobbying hard to maximise its opportunities.” With thousands of ships mothballed or retired around the world, the pandemic pause was a rare opportunity for change, says Prof Susanne Becken, who researches sustainable tourism at Griffith University. “The question is: are they willing?” Becken says. “Sustainable cruising would be the end of cheap cruising, and then you’d need to change the business model, because would you get 3,000 people on a boat?” The combination of cheap fuel and large passenger capacities has allowed companies to offer relatively low ticket prices, but Becken says the need to decarbonise will alter the underlying economics. “It’s not cheap,” Becken says. “This is what makes this controversial. It’s a bit like coal – a political hot potato. “For companies who have invested in these boats, they’re about to become stranded assets.” The managing director for Australasia of the Cruise Lines International Association (Clia), Joel Katz, says operators are already taking steps to end the use of low-grade bunker fuel. “Cruise lines are investing many billions of dollars in ships that offer greater efficiency and achieve significant emissions reductions as part of the industry’s pursuit of net carbon-neutral cruising by 2050,” Katz says. Clia members have joined a shipping industry proposal for a $5bn International Maritime Organization research fund to develop fuels such as “biofuel, methanol, ammonia, hydrogen and electric batteries”. In the meantime, Katz says, there has been “huge investment” in vessels that rely on liquid natural gas as a “transitional fuel”. “LNG ships are already sailing in parts of the world and another five are due for introduction this year,” he says. “More than half of the new-build ships on order internationally will use LNG for their primary propulsion.” As LNG is still a fossil fuel, Becken says even these vessels are at risk of becoming stranded assets as green hydrogen technology improves and the world introduces stricter emissions requirements. She says the industry should following the example of airports and airlines that voluntarily disclose CO2 emissions. Without this data it is impossible to know the industry’s impact, Becken says, even as it faces other challenges such as setting up renewable energy power supplies at ports and production facilities such as green hydrogen plants. “There’s no reason the cruise industry couldn’t do this, to develop a hydrogen plant you can use to make the fuel you need in 10 years. Then it’s just an additional cost built into the price of a ticket,” Becken says. “There’s a lot of anti-cruise-ship resentment out there. If the industry came out and said we understand, we know have to do something, and we’re setting up schemes like this, it would be good for their image.”",News/Environment,Sinking feeling: cruise ships chart return to Australia amid emissions concerns,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/17/sinking-feeling-cruise-ships-chart-return-to-australia-amid-emissions-concerns
4/17/2022,"Sandwiched between high-rise blocks stands a nearly 100-year-old Queenslander that has served as a pensioner’s home for the past decade. Now, the 65-year-old is being evicted by a developer to make way for yet another tower. “I’ve lived there for 10 years, it’s become home,” Bernie Maloney says. “It’s disappointing to get tossed around.” Like a lot of old Queenslanders, Maloney’s rental in the inner north suburb of Milton has seen better days. The roof is rusted, the handrails are held together by sticky tape and the whole building is in desperate need of a new coat of paint. But passersby don’t see what Maloney does; the possums in the roof that he feeds, the bush turkeys digging around the garden and the beautiful poinsettia tree in the backyard. It is also affordable. Maloney says he can’t afford to rent anywhere else in Brisbane and is not sure where he’ll end up once the 16 May eviction date comes around. “No landlord wants to rent to a single pensioner,” he says. “I will probably have to move out of Brisbane to stay temporarily with friends in Nimbin or Russell Island.” In January, property developer Goldfields Group bought Maloney’s home and three of the other remaining Queenslanders on the street. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The company plans to knock three of the houses down and uproot one pre-1911 property to a site in Wynnum. Once the land is cleared, the company plans to build a 19-storey apartment block on the acre block, hosting 130 units. “The area’s changed enormously. All these multi-storey buildings have gone up and there are hardly any Queenslanders left,” Maloney says. It’s not just Maloney and his housemate Brad who will be impacted by the eviction. Over the years, Maloney has ushered dozens of people off the streets and into his home, allowing them a safe place to stay when in need. “I’m a carer … [There’s] been dozens of people here. They didn’t all pay rent but stayed a few days or weeks at a time,” he says. Maloney’s generosity has earned him a kind of neighbourhood celebrity status in parts of south and inner-city Brisbane. He’s also won the support of the Brisbane Renters Alliance, who have launched a civil disobedience campaign to resist forced evictions. “We are now living through a housing crisis. 10,000 Brisbanites are homeless, over 50,000 Queenslanders are on the public housing waiting list [and] over 15,500 Queensland children are victims of housing stress,” a spokesperson from the Brisbane Renters Alliance said. “No one should be evicted into homelessness, especially not in one of the wealthiest nations on the planet.” A spokesperson from Goldfields said “as a responsible developer”, the company “is committed to the communities that we have a presence in.” “Goldfields is currently considering a further extension to the tenant’s lease notice period and, where possible, will assist with his efforts to secure an alternative residence.” Maloney says rent control should be introduced in Queensland to stop low-income renters being displaced. “I pay $320 a week in rent for my Milton home, on top of electricity and bills, [and] I’ve already been priced out of West End,” he says. “If we had 1,000 people willing to spend a couple weeks in jail, we could save the four old buildings and slow down this monstrosity.”",News/Australia news,Pensioner says he has nowhere to go after developer buys up Queensland homes to make way for apartments,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/17/pensioner-says-he-has-nowhere-to-go-after-developer-buys-up-queensland-homes-to-make-way-for-apartments
4/17/2022,"Six months ago I moved from the city to the outer suburbs and I’m yet to meet either of my next-door neighbours. On the day we arrived, a couple across the street said hello but it turns out they are the exception to the rule. People on my street tend to keep to themselves. My last place was on a main road in Melbourne’s inner north. From my bedroom window I was eye level with the passengers of the 508 bus. My kitchen window was almost directly opposite my neighbour’s. I had a direct line of vision into people’s lives, and it gave me a sense of comfort. Like many who endured Melbourne’s extensive lockdowns, my family and I escaped the inner city in search of more space and less contaminated air. Now in the leafy hills of the Dandenong Ranges, I open my blinds onto dense, verdant ferns. There is silence everywhere, interspersed with the prehistoric screech of cockatoos. I miss people. I miss listening to their arguments and the smell of their cooking. I miss treeless front yards and how close windows were to the street. I miss catching a glimpse of someone being completely themselves, like the girl I saw chatting on the phone while dangling her legs from the upstairs window. I miss the way everybody left the blinds open, resigned to a semi-public daily existence. In the hills of Melbourne’s Dandenong Ranges, deep-set houses and towering eucalyptus trees offer a lot of privacy, which for a stickybeak like me is a disaster. Luckily, soon after we moved in there was a rubbish collection and the streets became piled with discarded household items. On evening walks I sifted freely through my new neighbours’ intimate archives. I came across a kids-sized chest of drawers, “Patrick. Private. Keep out” carved clearly on the top one. “Keepout Jacob” was etched less confidently into the drawer below, next to a Blinky Bill sticker half torn away. I was struck by the moment siblings turn away from each other; the way one decides and the other is dragged along. Leaning against the drawers were two framed paintings signed by “Susan”. One was of a candle aflame against a black velvet curtain. The other was an anchor plunging into cloudy green water. Susan had to be their mother, and her sudden departure the root cause of her sons’ bitter feud. Past a splintered barbecue, a wet magazine collection and a discoloured floral crockery set there was a small wooden chair. It looked chainsawed out of a solid log. I inspected some white, cottony balls that had collected underneath it. “I’d be careful with that,” a rummager opposite me said. “Those look like redback eggs.” I replaced the chair in a way that appeared casual and picked up a DVD entitled “Tim and Donna’s Wedding”. “How great is this stuff,” I said. “It’s a good pile,” the person agreed, filling a bag with electrical cables. “Lotta cord.” A street over, there was a milk crate containing an old soccer ball and a framed photograph of a deeply tanned blonde woman with, I assumed, her adult son. They are sitting at an outside table of a bar and the son is laughing, self-conscious, looking slightly past his mother. She is gazing at him directly, her hand hovering above his forearm, her long red fingernails seemingly reaching for him and forever disappointed. There were exercise bikes and a lamp shade fringed with auburn tassels, a child’s scooter with pink love hearts stretched to the tallest adjustment, a rusted teal suitcase packed and unpacked across the decades. In the yard an old woman crouched over a bed of winter roses. I wondered if the luggage was hers and whether it landed her in a place she wanted to be. There’s a skink living in our bathroom and I’ve found millipedes curled in our bedsheets on more than one occasion. Apart from eventually being carried off by insects, I don’t know what’s in store for me in the hills. I’ve strung fairy lights along the balcony railing. When they’re on at night it feels like I’m on a ship floating on a black sea. I don’t have a community here yet. I’m attempting to build one by picking through my neighbours’ rubbish. Recently a man knocked on our door with a box of avocados. He’d bought too many at the market and insisted I take an armful. I thanked him and we introduced ourselves. That night I made guacamole and ate it alone on the floating balcony. It was a start.

4/17/2022,"Beyond the usual memorable factors – fears about the millennium bug, the dawn of the 21st century – 1 January 2000 is a significant date in Brookline, Massachusetts. In the town, on the outskirts of Boston, vendors are legally banned from selling tobacco products and e-cigarettes to anyone born after Y2K. The legislation came into effect last September, after a vote in November 2020, making Brookline the first US town to implement such a law, in the hopes of gradually phasing out smoking for younger generations. It isn’t clear how effective the policy in Brookline will be, given the town’s proximity to other jurisdictions where sales are legal. But similar proposals – often termed policies for “tobacco-free generations” (TFG) – are now being considered at the national level by several countries. New Zealand is set to introduce a law this year which would prevent anyone aged 14 and younger – when the legislation takes effect in 2023 – from ever legally buying smoking products. Unlike Brookline, New Zealand’s policy will not include a ban on e-cigarette sales. Lawmakers in Denmark are considering a similar proposal for anyone born after 2010, and in recent months both the Malaysian and Singaporean health ministries have flagged their intention of following New Zealand’s lead in aiming for a tobacco endgame. Should Australia consider similar legislation? In Australia, tobacco smoking is the leading cause of premature death and disability. It kills more people in this country each year than alcohol, car accidents, murders, suicides or – in the past two years – Covid, points out Jon Berrick, an emeritus professor at Singapore’s Yale-NUS College, who now lives in Sydney. A mathematician by training, Berrick developed a personal interest in tobacco policies and was one of a group of researchers who floated the TFG idea in a 2010 paper. It suggested 2000 as a threshold birth year for a “long-term phasing-in of a total ban”. Unlike laws prohibiting sales to under-18s or under-21s, “if you have it on a birth cohort basis … you’re sending out the message: there is no safe age for smoking”, Berrick says. Smoking rates have declined steadily in Australia since the 1990s, to 11.6% of adults in 2019. Between 2001 and 2019, the proportion of daily smokers aged 18 to 39 has halved, though figures have not improved in those in their 50s and 60s. Proponents of TFG laws believe it is a more palatable option than an outright ban on all smoking products. “You can’t just ban it overnight. What happens to the people who are dependent on it?” Berrick says. Sales restrictions based on birth date would instead concentrate efforts on preventing adolescents from taking up smoking in the first place, he says. To date, there has been one attempt to implement TFG legislation in Australia – an unsuccessful private members bill in Tasmania, introduced in 2014 by the independent MP Ivan Dean. The state would be well placed for implementing a TFG proposal, says Dr Kathryn Barnsley, an adjunct researcher at the University of Tasmania and convenor of SmokeFree Tasmania. “We’ve got a very good licensing system and highly efficient enforcement of sales to minors in Tasmania, which some of the other states don’t have.” The sale of tobacco products, as well as enforcement of regulations, is under the purview of state governments, “with the exception of some commonwealth legislation relating to advertising and packaging”, Barnsley says. There are, however, hints at age restrictions in the latest consultation draft of the 2022-2030 national tobacco strategy, which proposes to “consider the feasibility of raising the minimum age of purchase of tobacco products and monitor international developments on this matter”. TFG proposals are not without critics. Dr Brendan Gogarty, of the University of Tasmania, wrote in The Conversation in 2016 that while smoking “represents a significant social danger”, the legislative response to social risks “must be evidence-based and considerate of constitutional limits and civil rights”. “Targeting laws at people who cannot hold lawmakers to account at the polls is undemocratic. It is also unfair to have one generation telling the other to ‘do as I say, not as I do’,” Gogarty wrote. He also criticised the effectiveness of tobacco prohibition: “Laws that rely on prohibition to reduce the prevalence and harm from drugs generally fail to achieve their aims. That was true of historic alcohol prohibition laws. It remains true of the continued legal prohibition on narcotics.” But Berrick points to two historical precedents for generational phase-out, in regulations that successfully curbed opium smoking in Taiwan, then known as Formosa, in 1900 and Sri Lanka – a British colony at the time – in 1911. “You have to have demand to create a black market,” Barnsley says. “Tobacco would remain awash in Australia or Tasmania or any other state if you brought in the tobacco-free generation proposal, because it would still be sold legitimately in outlets.” Marita Hefler, an associate professor at the Menzies School of Health Research in Darwin, is also dismissive of prohibition criticisms. “It’s a lazy argument to say that ‘prohibition never works’ or to use the US experiment from the 1920s or even the ‘war on drugs’ as evidence,” she says. “After 30-plus years of policies to reduce smoking, the Australian public overwhelmingly have negative attitudes towards cigarettes and the tobacco industry. “A majority of smokers want to quit and wish they’d never started. Most smokers don’t want the young people in their lives to ever smoke.” One downside of the TFG proposal is that “this measure on its own won’t achieve Australia’s goal of less than 5% smoking prevalence by 2030, because it is a very slowly implemented phase-out,” says Coral Gartner, an associate professor at the University of Queensland and an international expert in tobacco control policy. “In New Zealand, it is a policy that is being brought in with a range of other policies that are likely to have a larger and faster impact on smoking prevalence, such as a very low nicotine standard for cigarettes,” she says. Gartner and Hefler are among public health experts who have argued for stricter regulation of tobacco sales in Australia, calling for a ban on cigarettes from being sold in general retail outlets. “If the level of potential harm from vaping products is considered unacceptable for them to be sold as consumer products [nicotine vapes are now prescription-only in Australia] – that should also make everyone question why is it acceptable for tobacco cigarettes to be sold … when they have a much stronger evidence base in terms of risk to health,” says Gartner. An alternative could be designing a “pharmaceutical-like” regulatory framework, she suggests, where the products are supplied in pharmacies and “a health professional can provide advice on risks and benefits”. Hefler says any TFG proposal would need to “avoid creating a new epidemic of e-cigarette use among young people and non-smokers” – as is a potential risk in New Zealand. “But cigarettes need even tighter regulation than e-cigarettes and are overdue to be phased out,” she says. More than a decade after he and his colleagues proposed the TFG idea, Berrick seems pleased that legislators around the world are now seriously considering it as an endgame approach to tobacco. “I joke that peer influence is just as important among health ministers as it is among teenagers,” he says.",News/Society,‘Total ban’: could this be the last generation of smokers?,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/17/total-ban-could-this-be-the-last-generation-of-smokers
4/17/2022,"The Greens have one job to do in suburban Melbourne. Earlier, at the 2020 election at Yarra city council, the party won five of the nine seats, with socialists picking up two. The Labor party failed to secure a single spot on the council. It was an embarrassment for the ALP, with the party growing increasingly frustrated at inner-city areas shifting their vote more progressive while it also tries to hold on to its more traditional voter base across the state. It also served as a warning for the upcoming state election. The federal seat is held by the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, by a comfortable margin, while the state seat of Richmond is in play after the popular Labor MP Richard Wynne announced his retirement. All the Greens councillors have to do is prove they can govern in their own right, in accordance with the party’s values. Since the 2020 election, the council has consistently made headlines for all the wrong reasons. Socialist party councillor Stephen Jolly says people are now thinking: “Jesus Christ, when we voted the council where seven of the nine councillors were either Green, or socialists … we did not expect Thatcherite policies.” Jolly refers to proposed – but dropped – council policies on increasing fees for sporting clubs to use facilities, banning alcohol use in a local park, and shooting down the redevelopment of a small amount of council land in Collingwood. “You would expect that from the major parties. But people expected better from the Greens – it’s like when you’re betrayed by your own family member.” The state government had proposed 200 units be built on public land in Collingwood. Half would be social housing, with some funding from the government. The Greens shot it down. The council argued it would have gifted the land to private developers. The state government argued the Greens have rejected social housing. “It’s interesting how the framing of it is so persistent and yet it was a private development. It was a gift to a private developer,” says Greens mayor at the time, Gabrielle de Vietri. De Vietri is no longer mayor. Last year, councillor Anab Mohamud went on medical leave while fighting charges over an alleged assault outside the Chasers nightclub, which hosts LGBTQ dance party Poof Doof, in South Yarra. Mohamud said in a Facebook post in January she has faced delays in the legal process and cannot tell her side of the story. “I’ve learned how slowly justice comes. Sadly, I am still not in a position to be able to share with you all that has happened to me. I will once the legal process has run its course.” But her leave meant the Greens’ five-person majority was reduced to four, and the other members of the council sought a new mayor to replace De Vietri. It took a total of four meetings to elect a new mayor, with a deal eventually reached for Sophie Wade to keep the position in the hands of the Greens. The process looked dysfunctional from the outside. Media analysis provided by Steem show only two Victorian councils in the past 12 months have received more media coverage than Yarra. City of Melbourne leads the pack with close to 5,000 mentions in the past year, followed by Casey – which has been the focus of a corruption scandal with 492. Yarra is in third place with 284. Wade says she’s not too worried about the reporting on the council and believes people are more focused on what is happening on their own streets. “What I emphasise is not to focus on the negative but to see what’s actually happening on your street and see what it’s like when you try to engage with your councillors because I think for most people, that’s a positive experience.” In its 2021 customer satisfaction survey, Yarra recorded 6.85 out of 10, which is recorded as a “good” response and just under the metropolitan average, but is the lowest score for the council since 2013. The main issues raised by households had nothing to do with the headlines. Some of those surveyed said the council has done a good job during the pandemic, praised the building of better bike paths and were grateful for the introduction of glass recycling. Others complained about communication with council, rubbish and recycling and rates. Shortly after Wade became mayor, the council’s chief executive left for another job and Victoria’s local government minister, Shaun Leane, announced the appointment of a municipal monitor. The Labor government cited the time taken to appoint the new mayor and other concerns. De Vietri, who is now on leave from council to run in Richmond in November, says Labor is feeling vulnerable and she wondered about the motivation for the monitor’s appointment. “I think to me, that sets the political context and it does make me wonder what actually is the motivation for this appointment?” she says. Leane’s office did not answer questions about whether the appointment was political, but a spokesperson says the monitor was appointed “following thoroughly canvassed issues and risks with its governance”. “We look forward to seeing Yarra city council shift its focus to the priorities and challenges facing the local community, led by its newly elected mayor and with the support of the monitor.” Leane later announced monitors for Darebin city council, Moira shire council and Wodonga city council. “[Local government is] not a very well-respected and strong tier of government in Australia,” says Dr David Hayward, professor of public policy and the social economy at RMIT. He says Yarra tends to have a good calibre of councillors and administrators, but believes the main problem with local governments is they have limited powers, which leaves their successes at the whim of state governments. “What tends to happen is state governments see them as basically a pawn to implement their policy agenda,” he says. Jolly says the best thing the Greens could do to keep the progressive residents in Melbourne’s inner north happy would be to stick to their policies. “If they implemented those policies locally, we wouldn’t be having this conversation. By doing that they’ve left a window of opportunity.” But Wade says that is exactly what the council is doing, running off a list of projects – including getting pool facilities off gas, transport projects and expanding open spaces – as key priorities. “A lot of our areas are industrial and are really suffering now from the fact that we’ve got a huge number of residents moving in but we haven’t got these beautiful old parks that residential bits of Melbourne do like Edinburgh Gardens,” she says. “We’re making a whole lot of strides to try to change that now.”",News/Australia news,The Greens and the challenge of governing a Melbourne council,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/17/the-greens-and-the-challenge-of-governing-a-melbourne-council
4/17/2022,"Three minutes into the second half of this FA Cup semi-final Luis Díaz took the ball just inside his own half, looked up and saw in freeze-frame the figure of Fernandinho suspended inches above the Wembley turf, rotated at an angle of 60 degrees to the ground, left leg extended to meet the ball – and in the process to send Díaz in a semi-somersault arc as the frame of Fernandino propelled itself through the space where previously he, Díaz, had stood. It wasn’t a foul, although the next one on Sadio Mané was, a slide into the ankle that really could have led to Fernandino being sent off. The tackle on Díaz was more like a message, a considered personal missive from the entire Manchester City dressing room. Because City will have hated the first half of this game. They finished it 3-0 down, having played like a team with small sacks of gravel tied to their ankles: hungover, frazzled, heads pounding, still burping up the taste of three-day-old after-dinner Atlético liqueurs. Mainly, they will have hated what Díaz did to them, the frills of his game as much as the hard edges. Díaz was not the man of the match in this 3-2 victory (that was probably Mané or Thiago). He didn’t score a goal or directly create one. But for 45 minutes he did something to City nobody has for quite some time, perhaps not since the 3-0 loss in the Champions League in 2018 when Mohamed Salah was in full galloping hare mode. Díaz took the mickey. He pranced about. He made risky little mocking turns and flicks. He looked, above all, like a man enjoying himself, which is in itself an affront to City’s sense of self. Here is a team that prides itself on suffocating its opponents, in inducing a migrainous 90-minute tightening of the temples. Fun? You don’t have fun here. Except this is what Díaz did and it felt significant as Liverpool continue to veer off into the rarefied air of the season’s end. There were plenty of other moments to drool over. Thiago’s, semi-impossible lift-pass with the outside of his big toe to tee up Mané’s finish for the third goal; the kind of pass that seems to stop the day, to turn the ball into a helium balloon, a candy floss bag. There was the sight of poor old Zack Steffen’s mistake for the second goal. And in between there were those little glimpses of illumination, of something that felt like fun, strength in reserve, the kind of qualities that might just take Liverpool close to something. They were always likely to start stronger. City had left the Wanda Metropolitano not just bruised but depleted by the sustained toxic emotion of the occasion. These are days that take a bite out of you. At which point, enter Díaz in full scamp mode. He is a fascinating footballer, a workaholic modern-day athlete, all shuttling cover and counterpressing. But he has just enough mischief too, a playfulness in his slender limbs. He was involved in the first goal as Liverpool’s left-hand side forced a corner that was headed back and in by Ibrahima Konaté. He was also involved in the third, ferreting away on the left and seeing the ball run to Thiago. In between he did stuff. He took the ball in the centre circle and chopped and shimmied away from three players, then eased a slightly insulting showtime pass through for Salah. He drew a kind of gurgling sigh from the crowd by the left touchline as he fed the ball back to Andy Robertson via a leaping, instep pirouette flick. He jinked inside and just stood right up against João Cancelo, rolling a foot over the ball the way you would playing a corridor tennis ball kickabout with a partially sighted pug. In return he got Cancelo’s shoulder in his face, which was probably fair enough. By half-time, Díaz had been fouled four times, completed five dribbles and romped about the pitch like a man who really does love this grey concrete bowl. He has played twice here in his time in England: won a League Cup final, beaten Chelsea, beaten City, left his rhythms, his own little snapshot moments all over that turf. Three Liverpool goals in his 15 games does not really tell the story of his impact. He looks unafraid, the kind of footballer who just wants to grow into this stage; not to mention a textural variation, another dribbler to complement Salah. City came back strongly in the second half and might have forced extra time at the death. But somehow it never really felt like that was the script. Now to the run-in. If there is one surefire way of ensuring Liverpool will not win English football’s first quadruple, it is to count up the games required to get there. But here goes anyway. Liverpool are 11 games away, although City must also drop points in the league for them to win the title. Whatever happens from here it will be quick, every game carrying its own jeopardy. This is just something to be savoured, a rare moment in any footballing life. It will take luck, brilliance, luck and plenty more luck. Díaz will be a key part of the collective either way. And there was a glimmer of something here in his sense of fun, his vim, the feeling of someone ready to keep running to the end.",Sport/Football,Liverpool’s Luis Díaz finds full scamp mode to torment Manchester City | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/16/liverpools-luis-diaz-finds-full-scamp-mode-to-torment-manchester-city
4/17/2022,"Pep Guardiola defended his team selection and stand-in goalkeeper, Zack Steffen, following a dreadful first-half display that ruined Manchester City’s Treble chances in the FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool. Liverpool led 3-0 at the break, courtesy of a first-half performance that Jürgen Klopp labelled the best of his reign plus a calamitous error by Steffen, who dithered on John Stones’s back pass and allowed Sadio Mané to score with a tackle. The US international was one of seven changes Guardiola made from the team that started Wednesday’s bruising Champions League quarter-final at Atlético Madrid. He was adamant there was no alternative in the midst of a gruelling schedule and pursuit of the Premier League title. The City manager insisted: “We had a lot of fixtures and travels and a lot of important games and that’s why I picked the team. The first goal was a set piece, where Liverpool are so strong and score many goals, and the second was an accident. Then we conceded a goal in the last minute of the first half, but afterwards we showed incredible pride. We didn’t look tired after we scored because football is about momentum. We had the most clear chances and we scored goals. It is not easy to do that against Liverpool. We fought to the end and showed our pride.” Guardiola confirmed Rodri and Riyad Mahrez were fit to play at Wembley but his other changes from Madrid, including Kevin De Bruyne, all had fitness problems. He added: “Rúben [Dias] has had seven weeks off, Kyle [Walker] couldn’t play and [Ilkay] Gündogan had a knock on the knee. It is what it is when you play a lot of games. When everyone is fit we are OK, but to play Madrid, Liverpool, Madrid, Liverpool in a short space of time meant we had to rotate players. We know when we arrive at this stage of the season and we are fighting for titles it can be hard. It was difficult today – but we reacted in a marvellous way and we were close to coming back.” The City manager also insisted it would have been unfair not to play Steffen, his domestic cup keeper this season, and that his mistake was a risk in keeping with the team’s strategy. Guardiola explained: “I haven’t spoken to Zack. It was an accident but we need him to try because that’s how we play our football. It was an accident, it happens. Edi [Ederson] was close in the last game as well. We need that to create our football we use our keeper to move our opponents into different situations. I’m pretty sure Zack didn’t want to do it. Sometimes the strikers miss in front of the keeper, other times the keeper makes a mistake. It was a decision [to play him] from days ago. It is unfair when you play cups and you don’t play them. He deserves to play and after that he had a good game. He made good saves and is an exceptional keeper.” Klopp claimed Mané’s “acceleration and desire” were more responsible for Liverpool’s second goal than Steffen’s error and lauded an exceptional first half. “I think it was [the best first-half display of his reign], that was the feeling I had when I saw it, with the quality of the opponent. You saw in the second half how good they really are. Denying them in so many moments, creating your own opportunities and using them is very difficult. The first half was outstanding in pretty much all parts of the game.” City apologised to Liverpool and condemned supporters who chanted during a minute’s silence to mark the 33rd anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster before kick-off. Michael Oliver, the referee, cut short the intended commemoration after some City fans failed to observe the tribute. A City spokesperson said: “Manchester City are extremely disappointed with the actions of some City supporters during the minute’s silence before today’s game. The club sincerely apologises to all those connected with Liverpool Football Club.” Klopp responded: “Of course we accept their apology. We never thought this was Man City although there were some people who didn’t understand the situation and that’s not nice and felt really wrong in that moment. We cannot change that and it’s nothing to do with City.”",Sport/Football,Guardiola defends Zack Steffen after mistake against Liverpool costs City,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/16/guardiola-defends-zack-steffen-after-mistake-against-liverpool-costs-city
