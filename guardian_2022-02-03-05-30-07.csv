2/3/2022,"Three more MPs have joined the growing list of Conservatives who have said publicly they have submitted letters of no confidence in Boris Johnson. The prime minister has found himself under growing pressure after the publication of the pared-back Sue Gray report and for repeating false and unfounded accusations about Keir Starmer’s time at the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) on Monday.  If 54 letters are received by Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the influential 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, a confidence vote will be held. Here is a rundown of those who have said publicly that they have submitted letters. Gary Streeter, MP for South West Devon since 1992 “I cannot reconcile the pain and sacrifice of the vast majority of the British public during lockdown with the attitude and activities of those working in Downing Street. “Accordingly, I have now submitted a letter seeking a motion of no confidence in the prime minister.” Anthony Mangnall, MP for Totnes since 2019 “Standards in public life matter. At this time I can no longer support the PM,” he said. “His actions and mistruths are overshadowing the extraordinary work of so many excellent ministers and colleagues. I have submitted a letter of no confidence.” Tobias Ellwood, MP for Bournemouth East since 2005 Speaking to Sky News, he said: “I believe it’s time for the prime minister to take a grip of this; he himself should call a vote of confidence rather than waiting for the inevitable 54 letters to be eventually submitted.” Peter Aldous, MP for Waveney since 2010 Aldous tweeted that Johnson should resign, adding: “Whilst I am conscious that others will disagree with me, I believe that this is in the best interests of the country, the government and the Conservative party.” Andrew Bridgen, MP for North West Leicestershire since 2010 After submitting his letter, he said: “Boris Johnson has lost the moral authority to lead the country. If there’s another emergency where he has to call on the public to make sacrifices, he doesn’t have that authority.” Douglas Ross, MP for Moray since 2017 and leader of the Scottish Conservatives “There’s a feeling that we’re getting closer and closer to the 54 number of letters required to go into the 1922 Committee, which suggests that there are far more than those of us who have publicly stated our position that are unhappy with the current prime minister,” he told BBC Radio Scotland last month. Roger Gale, MP for North Thanet since 1983 “I think it’s serious. I think it’s very serious indeed. And I frankly think that he’s done a good job delivering certain things. But I think we’ve now got to the stage where, frankly, we have to find another leader,” he said.",News/Politics,Tory rebels: MPs who openly sent letter of no confidence in Boris Johnson,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/02/tory-rebels-mps-who-openly-sent-letter-of-no-confidence-in-boris-johnson
2/3/2022,"A Metropolitan police officer disciplined after an inquiry into misogynistic and racist messages has since been promoted, the Guardian has learned, as Cressida Dick was warned she could lose the confidence of the mayor of London. Misconduct was proven against the unnamed officer after a watchdog inquiry into messages about hitting and raping women, which were shared by up to 19 officers based mainly at Charing Cross police station.  There were also messages about the deaths of black babies and the Holocaust, prompting accusations of a culture of misogyny and racism within the country’s biggest force. The officer was promoted from the rank of constable to sergeant despite being sanctioned for failing to report wrongdoing, the Met confirmed. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) also revealed that three officers who remain in the Met sent potentially discriminatory messages. They were classed as being less serious than the messages that emerged on Tuesday. On Wednesday the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, put Dick on notice that she had to urgently reform the force or he could withdraw his confidence in her. The commissioner is appointed by the mayor and home secretary. For the first time sources made clear Khan would consider attempting to oust Dick if she fails to deliver rapid progress. The two had a 90-minute meeting described as “frank” after the revelations about Charing Cross and continuing crises gripping the Met. A source close to Khan said: “If the commissioner is not able to do so, then the mayor will have to consider whether she is the right person to lead the change needed at the Met.” The souring of relations came after the IOPC revealed shocking details of messages shared by Met officers between 2016, the year before Dick became commissioner, and 2018. They were uncovered by accident. One male officer wrote to a female officer: “I would happily rape you … if I was single I would happily chloroform you.” The IOPC said the behaviour was part of an offensive Met police culture, not just rogue individuals. “We believe these incidents are not isolated or simply the behaviour of a few ‘bad apples’.” The Met denies the force is plagued by misogyny and racism. Of 14 officers investigated, two deemed to be the worst offenders were sacked for gross misconduct. Misconduct was proven against another three, while another officer resigned before the disciplinary process was complete. On Wednesday the Met confirmed that one officer against whom misconduct was proven had been promoted. The force said the officer “attended a misconduct meeting and was given management action/advice about reporting wrongdoing”. A spokesperson said: “In order to achieve promotion, any officer has to go through a broad and rigorous assessment process. Following that they have to complete an extensive workbook to evidence their skills and abilities to ensure they are capable of the role/rank. “We have also spoken to line managers to confirm all those subject to the IOPC investigation who are still in the Met are performing to the expected standards … It was assessed that the police sergeant had breached the standards of professional behaviour by failing to challenge or report inappropriate behaviour.” The Met continued: “Because the police sergeant demonstrated that she had personally developed and learned since the incident, it was agreed by the IOPC that she should be subject to management action only, and that she should complete an attachment with a professional standards unit to develop her knowledge further.” The IOPC says that three officers investigated and who remain in the Met sent messages which “could be regarded as homophobic, racist or otherwise discriminatory”, adding: “The evidence we gathered indicated that three of those had sent messages of an inappropriate nature.” Dick’s five-year term expires in April and she then begins a two-year extension which Khan and the home secretary, Priti Patel, approved last year. Patel questioned the Met’s leadership during questioning by MPs on the home affairs select committee on Wednesday. She said there had been “too many instances where, in policing, we just see the most appalling behaviours” and added: “There are problems with the culture, and some aspects of the culture, within the Metropolitan police. “We are not seeing one-off incidences, this is not isolated. I also think it shows a failure of leadership in some quarters.” Patel said she had confidence in the commissioner but added: “There are lots of issues there where we need to see major … significant improvements: culture, delivery, accountability and protecting the streets.” A spokesperson for Khan said: “The mayor made clear to the commissioner how angry he is with a return to the bad days of the Met of his childhood in the 1970s and 80s, and that neither he nor Londoners will put up with this.“He has put the commissioner on notice. He said the Met needs to urgently show it has an effective plan for restoring the trust and confidence of Londoners in the police and to drive out the culture of racism, homophobia, bullying and misogyny which clearly still exists within its ranks.”",News/UK news,Met officer was promoted despite misconduct over sexist and racist messages,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/02/met-officer-was-promoted-despite-misconduct-over-sexist-and-racist-messages
2/3/2022,"Four men have been charged in the overdose death of actor Michael K Williams, a federal prosecutor said on Wednesday. US attorney Damian Williams and the New York City police commissioner, Keechant Sewell, said the four were charged in criminal complaints unsealed on Tuesday and Wednesday in Manhattan federal court in a narcotics conspiracy alleging their involvement in the distribution of fentanyl-laced heroin that resulted in the death of Williams, who was best known for playing Omar Little on The Wire.  They allege that one of the men charged, named as Irvin Cartagena, sold the deadly dose of drugs to Williams New York City’s medical examiner earlier ruled that Williams, 54, died of acute drug intoxication on 6 September. He was found dead by family members in his penthouse apartment. At that time, the medical examiner’s office ruled Williams’s death an accident. “Michael K Williams, a prominent actor and producer, tragically overdosed in his New York City apartment from fentanyl-laced heroin,” Damian Williams said in a press release. “Today, along with our law enforcement partners at the NYPD, we announce the arrests of members of a drug crew, including Irvin Cartagena, the man who we allege sold the deadly dose of drugs to Michael K Williams.

2/3/2022,"Good morning. Joe Biden moves to counteract Russia’s long shadow over Ukraine, the aged care and disability sectors reveal worrying details about the ongoing employment shortage, and why the cost of living could become a key election issue. Some 140,000 shifts at aged care facilities are going unfilled every week, a situation the chief executive of the sector’s peak representative group has said is “absolutely a crisis” and called for “urgent help”, including the deployment of Australian defence force personnel. The government has pledged two $400 retention payments for aged care workers but this has drawn the ire of the disability sector, whose staff are not eligible for the bonuses. Thousands of potential workers have been stranded overseas due to Australia’s hard border, with only one-in-four applications for travel exemptions approved between August 2020 and December last year. In January alone, 499 aged care residents died from Covid, with 23,900 active cases among residents and staff.  The US will deploy an additional 3,000 troops throughout eastern Europe in response to continued Russian buildups along its border with Ukraine. A spokesman for the Pentagon said: “This force is designed to deter aggression and enhance our defensive capabilities in frontline allied states,” including Poland, Romania and Germany. The US has an additional 8,500 troops on short notice, but both the US and Nato have confirmed that no combat troops would enter Ukraine itself. Vladimir Putin offered his first public comments regarding the crisis in more than a month, accusing the US of ignoring its security proposals. Scott Morrison has dismissed Amnesty International’s calls to condemn Israel for “crimes against humanity”, telling media “no country is perfect”. The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, rejected the NGO’s assessment that Israel is actively perpetrating apartheid against Palestinians, adding: “We remain a firm supporter of the state of Israel.” Labor has said use of the term apartheid is “not helpful” but described the 280-page report as “concerning”. The London-based human rights organisation said the report had “demonstrated that Israel has imposed a system of oppression and domination over Palestinians”. Three in four Australians do not support the proposal that statements anchored in religious belief should be exempt from anti-discrimination laws – a key part of the Coalition’s religious discrimination bill, a new poll suggests. The accuracy of school ventilation audits is being heavily criticised after two reviews of classroom capacity at a school in the Blue Mountains returned recommendations that varied by 500%. Consumer advocates warn a key recommendation of the banking royal commission has not been fulfilled, with the government accused of failing to examine the rates of commission paid to agents who sell junk insurance. Melinda French Gates, co-founder of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, will no longer donate the majority of her wealth to the philanthropic organisation. French Gates remains committed to philanthropic endeavours but has said the concentration of wealth in the fund represented “an absurdity”. At least 60 people have been killed by armed militia in a displacement camp in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Norwegian Refugee Council said those killed were “vulnerable families” who had fled violence. A third Tory MP has called for a no confidence vote in UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, with the Conservative MP for South West Devon, Gary Streeter, saying he “cannot reconcile the pain and sacrifice” of the British public with the “attitude and activities of those working in Downing Street”. Norway has confirmed a new gender-neutral pronoun is likely to officially enter the language within the next year. “Hen” will become an alternative to the existing singular third-person pronouns, the feminine “hun” and the masculine “han”. “Do you know which fish I need to make ‘ota ika?” A staple of Sunday lunch in the Tongan community and a soul food often compared to ceviche, as Sela Atiola writes, it’s the little details that make this dish special. “I didn’t always appreciate and enjoy ‘ota ika as a child. The thought of raw fish chunks immersed in a cloudy, soupy pool did not charm my fledgling palate the way a Big Mac could.” But done right, this simple dish becomes a “riot of flavours” and an homage to the ocean’s importance. Amid rising inflation, suddenly Australia’s cost of living could become a key election issue, Greg Jericho argues. “While inflation is a useful measure, it can hide the reality not just of cost of living but also of the impact of price rises of items that you cannot avoid – in effect, the cost of essential living.” And with this being experienced at different intensities across different cohorts of society, expect the issue to factor in many people’s voting preferences. Why has a 50-year-old got a TikTok account? It’s a question veteran Australian funnyman, David Collins, AKA one half of the Umbilical Brothers, poses to himself.

2/3/2022,"Royal Mail has launched an investigation after sorting office staff appeared to be high on drugs after allegedly eating hash brownies from an unclaimed parcel. Video of the incident emerged on Tuesday morning purporting to show postal workers at a delivery office in Clapham, south London, struggling to stand after consuming the cannabis-laced snacks.  One of the postal workers appeared bewildered and had to be helped with his delivery trolley. A colleague could be heard advising him: “You’re just really high.” It had been thought that he had eaten two of the hash brownies. But he corrected a female colleague in slurred speech, saying: “I had four in all.” A male voice can be heard saying: “I think it’s weed.” The video showed the office had been a sent a package marked “Edibles by Pablo Chocobar”. A caption said the package had laid unclaimed for a month marked with an address from a house that was empty, it said. It added: “So we opened em and they got handed out. They were eaten between 5.30 [and] 7.30am.” Another caption said that one of the workers who ate the edibles “was walking to a door and thought he was walking forever”. Royal Mail did not see the funny side of the incident and is considering disciplinary action. There were unconfirmed reports that some of the staff involved have been suspended. In a statement a spokesperson said: “Royal Mail expects the highest standards of behaviour from our people at all times. We are taking this matter very seriously.” It added: “We have commenced an investigation, which will determine whether any further action, including disciplinary action, might be taken.

2/3/2022,"Dawn Astle has agreed to be the head of a dedicated dementia department in the Professional Footballers’ Association as part of the union’s push to ensure support for former players with neurodegenerative diseases is “a top priority”. Last month marked 20 years since Astle’s father, Jeff, the former England and West Brom forward, died aged 59 from accumulated brain trauma. The PFA’s chief executive, Maheta Molango, who was appointed last June, said he was “acutely aware that this is just the first step”. Astle will speak to current players to help raise awareness.  In 2019, a professional study by Dr Willie Stewart, a neuropathologist, found that former professional footballers were 3.5 times more likely to die with dementia than the general public. “As the players’ union, and the voice of professional footballers, it is vital that the PFA is stronger in challenging the industry to ensure the wellbeing and interests of former players living with dementia are better represented,” Astle said. “I will always continue to support former players and their families living with dementia now, but a key focus of this new role will be to strengthen protections for current players and future generations.” Astle, who has been highly critical of the PFA, will share her experiences as part of a role that will involve education, monitoring research and discussing the issue with key stakeholders. The former Wycombe midfielder Matt Bloomfield, who announced his retirement in the Guardian on Wednesday after a series of concussions, is among those keen to support the programme. Bloomfield was previously on the PFA management committee and lobbied for concussion substitutes. “The education around brain health needs to be that you cannot take any shortcuts or any chances,” said the 37-year-old, who made more than 550 career appearances. Rachel Walden, whose father, the former Portsmouth player Rod Taylor, died with dementia, will lead the department’s family support team.

2/3/2022,"The much-heralded white paper on levelling up is long – 332 pages – and rich in detail, if not necessarily in specific policy solutions. Here are the basics of what it contains.  The UK is very unequal The first 120-plus pages of the report is a thorough and arguably damning description of how different areas of the UK are often vastly different, by metrics including productivity, pay and health, which are often wider than in many equivalent nations. Some are particularly glaring, for example that men and women in certain areas can expect 12 fewer healthy years of life on average than those in the best-performing. London dominates – but it’s more complex It stresses that the UK’s “second tier” cities tend to underperform by international standards. However, it also notes that differences within regions and cities are often bigger than those between regions, and that many of London’s advantages diminish when housing costs are accounted for. It’s not just about money The report also highlights very glaring differences in life satisfaction, and that in some cases, better-off places score very low for this. These differences matter Geographical disparities have a high “stickiness” in terms of life chances, and a disadvantaged background tends to spell worse prospects, it says. Geographical disparities for life chances can be very big – a child on free school meals in London has over twice the chance of going to university than one outside London, for example. There are many reasons for this One is huge differences in private funding – London, the south-east, the east and the north-west have 55% of the UK’s private business but get 86% of investment. But while London and the south-east have the most transport funding and housing wealth, they also face the biggest pressures on both. The UK is also much more centralised than the OECD average. It’s partly about austerity The problems set out are very long term, and while the white paper does not say this, it is well known that many disparities have got worse since the Conservative-led spending cuts imposed since 2010. While this is largely speculative, the white paper estimates a successful levelling-up programme could see a permanent GDP rise of £50bn a year, or about 2% of the total. The framework The section on possible policies is simultaneously very detailed in parts, but underpinned by an almost philosophical framework, based around five “pillars”. These are: a “mission-oriented” approach to policy, with the US moon landings and the Covid vaccines cited as examples; a reorientation of central decision-making; greater local empowerment; more regional data and transparency; and greater overall accountability. It also calls for a long-term approach, saying UK policy in this area in the past has been “characterised by endemic policy churn”. The specific policy suggestions Below the five “pillars” sit 12 “missions”, all of which are specific (if at times vaguely phrased) targets to be achieved by 2030. They are:  Increase pay, employment and productivity across the UK, and reduce regional gaps.  Domestic public investment in R&D outside south-east to rise by at least 40%.  London-style public transport connectivity across UK, eg integrated ticketing.  Nationwide gigabit broadband and 4G, with 5G for “majority” of population.  Gains in primary-age reading, writing and maths, with smaller regional gaps.  Big increase numbers for skills training, particularly in the lowest skilled areas.  Narrowing healthy life expectancy gap, with a UK-wide rise of five years by 2035.  Overall rise in perceived wellbeing; reduction in disparities.  Increase in overall “pride in place”, and fewer disparities.  Rise in overall number of first-time homebuyers.  Overall fall in many crimes, focused on worst-affected areas.  Devolution deal for “every part of England that wants one”. The white paper promises “a structured process of visits” by ministers to discuss how levelling up can happen in that area, plus local advisory panels. It also commits to the government publishing an annual report on progress for the targets, and strengthening devolution legislation in England. There is not much new money – yet It is notable that much of what is described has funding reference to earlier spending reviews and the like. To an extent this would be the expectation for a white paper, which are a first stage in the process. However, it does highlight the apparent reluctance of the Treasury to commit new money to what meant to be the government’s headline policy. Ministers do not want it to be “levelling down” In his foreword to the white paper, Boris Johnson has these reassuring words for people who live in advantaged areas: “The answer to it lies not in cutting down the tall poppies, or attempting to hobble the areas that are doing well.”",News/Inequality,What does the levelling up white paper say?,https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2022/feb/02/what-does-the-levelling-up-white-paper-say
2/3/2022,"Welcome to the old days. Not so different to the new days. Even though prime minister’s questions by and large took a break from partygate and retreated to the more familiar ground of the economy, the song was still pretty much the same. There were confected cheers from a handful of Tory MPs desperate to sound like several dozen, all of whom will happily stab Boris Johnson in the back whenever they think his time is up. And with Tobias Ellwood, Anthony Mangnall and Gary Streeter having submitted letters to of no confidence to the 1922 Committee on Wednesday, that time is getting ever nearer.  Then there is the prime minister. Still living in his post-truth multiverse where there are as many different versions of reality as are required to get through from one day to the next. A man to whom honesty and decency are complete strangers. A man who lies because … because he always has. A man without morality who thinks nothing of breaking any promise he has ever made. A man who has proved time and again that, just when you think he’s gone as low as he can get, he can always find ways to go lower yet. Keir Starmer knew better than to ask the Suspect for an apology for the Jimmy Savile lie he had told about him during Monday’s statement on Sue Gray. Rather he chose to remind the Conservatives they had been the party of Winston Churchill and that they now had a leader whose source material was the propaganda of violent fascist groups. Many Tories had the grace to wince at that – three Conservative select committee chairs had publicly asked Johnson to say sorry – but Big Dog just smirked, ran his hands through the toddler haircut and bobbed around in his seat. And when he got the chance, he doubled down on his claims that the Labour leader had protected one of the UK’s most notorious paedophiles. I guess he thinks it’s both funny and clever. At the start of proceedings, the Speaker had reminded everyone of the need to maintain parliamentary standards. Everyone but the Suspect appeared to have taken it onboard. He degrades everything with which he comes in contact. His cabinet colleagues look more tawdry with every day that passes without them having the self-worth to call out their leader’s behaviour. Then again Johnson has never cared about how many people he takes down with him. The Labour leader went on to challenge Boris over the cost of living. Under the Tories, the UK had become a low-growth and high-tax economy. As ever, Johnson blustered and invented some lies. The UK was the fastest-growing economy in the G7. It isn’t. Over the last three months for which there are figures, the UK ranks only fifth in the G7. Taxes weren’t going up. (They were.) There were more people in work than before the pandemic. (There weren’t.) You get the picture. This stuff gets so tiring to hear week in, week out. It’s a wonder if Johnson actually understands anything beyond his own survival. And that’s mere instinct. He certainly doesn’t think before he speaks. He ended by mumbling about freeports. He’s still under the impression they are some kind of Brexit spinoff. Starmer did observe that Johnson was going to have to do a bit better when he was interviewed under police caution. He’s not wrong. The Scottish National party leader, Ian Blackford, was determined to have yet another go at seeing if he could get Johnson to fess up. Though first he made a point about saying he was going to follow parliamentary guidelines and avoid calling the liar a liar. Even when everyone knew the liar was a liar and he would himself have to lie by pretending the liar wasn’t a liar. Big Dog kept his head down and just dismissively waved him away with his paw. “I will comply with the law,” he said. That would be a first. So don’t hold your breath. “I’m in it to serve my country,” the Suspect insisted. Another lie, of course. Though he could have meant serve as in fuck up. But just imagine the terrifying implications were it to be true. That Boris genuinely thought he was doing us all a favour by being prime minister. That what we needed was a narcissist who was a joke on the world stage. Both the Americans and the Russians have been taking the piss out of Johnson for his inability to tell the truth about parties and the Ukrainians were so underwhelmed by his visit that none of its media could be bothered to direct a single question towards him. The rest of PMQs rather petered out as the Suspect tried to curry favour with Tory backbenchers for whom he had no respect but now happened to need. Chris Loder was told there would be a new railway timetable for West Dorset this month. Which would be nice if there was a train line in West Dorset. Henry Smith was congratulated for his suggestion there should be a minister for telling everyone what the benefits of Brexit were. Very much a part-time job, presumably, as there are next to none. Or maybe we should all just learn to tune in to the rapture. Big Dog also declared that he was enormously sad his former press secretary Allegra Stratton had resigned. Which was odd. Because before he had been forced to admit that he had been to the parties he had said he was furious with her for joking about the parties. Some might have appreciated the irony that Stratton is the only person to have resigned from No 10 and she didn’t even go to one of the parties. You can’t have that level of decency in Johnson’s Tory party.",News/Politics,Big Dog’s doings besmirch the party of Churchill | John Crace,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/02/big-dogs-doings-besmirch-the-party-of-churchill
2/3/2022,"The need to reach net zero carbon emissions, and the green jobs that could be created in doing so, received scant attention in the government’s levelling-up strategy, an omission slammed by green campaigners and businesses. The mention of “the green industrial revolution and transition to net zero” came second bottom of the list of 16 priorities in the levelling-up paper published on Wednesday, promising £26bn of capital investment, though green analysts said it was not clear if any of this was new money or how it would be spent.  The strategy did not include any commitment to insulate the UK’s draughty homes, despite the current energy price crisis, or to shift the UK away from its expensive reliance on imported gas. Ed Matthew, campaigns director at the climate crisis thinktank E3G, said: “As energy bills go through the roof due to the rocketing cost of gas, it is worth remembering that the most energy-leaking housing stock in western Europe is in the north of England. Fixing it would slash energy bills and emissions whilst boosting the economy of the north. Failing to put that at the heart of this levelling up strategy is a spectacular own goal.” Renewable energy should also have played a greater role, argued Nina Skorupska, chief executive of the Association for Renewable Energy and Clean Technology. “[The paper] is a missed opportunity,” she said. Pointing to Humberside, where investment in offshore wind has driven a resurgence of manufacturing jobs, Skorupska said it could be “replicated on a much wider scale” if ministers took action. Cara Jenkinson, cities manager at the climate charity Ashden, said: “We are really surprised and disappointed to see the absence of green skills and commitments connected to net zero.” Economists have told the government since soon after the start of the Covid-19 pandemic that a “green recovery” would create jobs, reduce long-term costs and put the UK on track to meet its carbon targets. They have urged for schemes such as home insulation; installing electric vehicle charging networks; constructing cycle lanes and pedestrian areas; planting trees; and building flood defences. These projects would reduce energy consumption, cut emissions, help guard against the worst impacts of the climate crisis, and have health and social benefits, such as less air pollution and more liveable cities. Ed Birkett, head of energy and environment at the thinktank Policy Exchange, said the paper dwelt on some of the risks to jobs from the shift away from high-carbon industries, but had much less to say about how to craft a green future. “It is surprising that the white paper makes very little mention of how the government will encourage green industries to locate in the UK, and specifically in the left-behind areas,” he said. There were a few examples of green investment: the £1bn automotive transformation fund, for electric vehicle manufacturing and battery gigafactories; £160m for ports, to encourage the manufacture of offshore wind turbines; and £1bn for carbon capture and storage. Some of the other funds could have a beneficial impact on the green recovery, such as £5bn for rural broadband, and transport funding amounting to £5.7bn in eight city regions – with £5bn for “buses and active travel” – and £96bn to be spent on the integrated rail plan. However, political opponents said the plans did not amount to a green recovery to level up the country and shift the UK to a low-carbon footing. Wera Hobhouse, the Liberal Democrat climate and energy spokesperson, said: “The silence from ministers on net zero and green jobs in their levelling up plans is deafening. Delivering a fair and just transition to net zero should be at the heart of the government’s levelling up agenda. Yet today we heard nothing on how to ensure that more deprived regions and communities do not shoulder the biggest burden.” Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, said: “A real plan to level up would be one that invested in the good green jobs of the future, with an ambitious Green New Deal to transform homes, buildings, local transport and energy supply, and a nature and net zero test for all infrastructure spending.”",News/Environment,"Green opportunities missed in UK levelling up strategy, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/02/green-opportunities-missed-in-uk-levelling-up-strategy-say-experts
2/3/2022,"The Treasury is scrambling to complete 11th hour plans capable of softening a national cost of living crisis, including a £200 rebate on energy bills and more help for the poorest households. No 10 and the Treasury have been under pressure from Tory MPs to act as millions of households brace for a record hike in energy bills from April, and the prospect of rising mortgage rates and tax increases.  With the Conservatives sliding in the polls and Boris Johnson under fire over parties in No 10 during lockdown, the prime minister and his chancellor Rishi Sunak met to stitch together a multi-billion pound package to address concerns about household bills. Downing Street repeatedly refused to comment on Wednesday on the idea of a £200 discount on energy bills, backed by a £5.4bn plan to make loans available to energy suppliers which would be repayable over several years. However, the measures are expected to be a major plank of the package due to be announced as soon as Thursday. The Treasury is also understood to be considering a targeted approach to help the most vulnerable families by doubling the payouts from an existing winter fuel payments scheme and extending its reach to include more families. Ofgem, the energy regulator, is to announce on Thursday morning a rise in the current cap on energy bills will bring steepest hike for default energy tariffs on record. This threatens to catapult the average home energy bill to almost £2,000 a year from April, from £1,277 over the winter, plunging millions into fuel poverty. In an unprecedented move, Ofgem agreed to bring forward its scheduled announcement for the new cap on default energy tariffs from Monday to align with the Treasury’s plan to set out a series of measures to help ease the burden on families. Households can also expect mortgages and other borrowing to get more expensive as the Bank of England tries to keep surging inflation under control. The Bank is widely expected to signal a hike in interest rates on the same day as the energy announcement, dealing a double whammy to households paying off mortgages and other debts. Banks and building societies are expected to respond immediately by lifting variable rates. Ministers and central bankers have been forced to act as households brace for the toughest squeeze on incomes in years. The official inflation rate reached 5.4% in December, the highest level since March 1992, driven by soaring gas and electricity prices and the higher cost of food and clothes. Threadneedle Street has warned that inflation could peak at close to 6% by April, three times the 2% target rate set by the government. The Treasury is under pressure to cool the growing concerns over a nationwide cost crisis by setting out a multi-billion pound cushion for hard-pressed families and businesses, many of which are still reeling from the economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, Johnson and Sunak have resisted calls to scrap April’s controversial £12bn increase in national insurance contributions. Citizens Advice has warned the government that, without action to support those on the lowest incomes, hard-pressed families would be pushed past breaking point. In a “red alert warning” ahead of the expected energy price hike, the consumer group revealed that the number of people seeking one-to-one crisis support from Citizens Advice such as referral to food banks and advice on emergency one-off grants reached its highest level on record last month. More than 270,000 sought one-to-one advice from Citizens Advice, and the charity expects numbers to rise once the energy price hike takes effect from April. “Cost-of-living pressures are at boiling point,” said dame Clare Moriarty, the chief executive of Citizens Advice. “Frontline advisers are hearing desperate stories of families living in just one room to keep warm, people turning off their fridges to save money and others relying on hot-water bottles instead of heating due to fears about mounting bills.” The consumer group said its data had reached “red alert levels” as the number of people supported with energy debts climbed to more than 8,000 for the first time, while the average energy debt climbed to a record £1,450, up from £1,330 in 2020. “If the government doesn’t act soon and bring forward a package of support for those on the lowest incomes, many more households will be pushed beyond breaking point,” she said.",News/Business,Treasury preparing 11th hour package to soften national cost of living crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/02/treasury-preparing-11th-hour-package-to-soften-national-cost-of-living-crisis
