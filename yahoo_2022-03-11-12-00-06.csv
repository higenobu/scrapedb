3/11/2022,"The Russian ruble sank after the Moscow exchange reopened trading of the fiat currency. The ruble has lost almost 40% of its value so far this year and is sitting at historic lows. The Moscow exchange kept stock trading closed and stopped the trading of foreign currencies. The Russian ruble sank after Moscow's exchange reopened it for trading Wednesday following a pause amid the war in Ukraine. The Moscow exchange closed ruble trading Friday as sanctions from the West — brought on by Putin's forces attacking Ukraine — hit Russia's economy, while offshore trading continued. Since the closure, more moves from the West have targeted Putin's economy, and Russians got their first chance this week to react when the exchange reopened ruble trading Wednesday. According to an early morning report from Bloomberg, the fiat currency sank 11% to 117.7 per dollar. The latest drop means the ruble has fallen nearly 40% so far this year, to historic lows, and is worth less than a penny. Even as Russia's central bank reopened currency trading, it kept the stock exchange closed for a second week and it stopped the sale of foreign currencies, Insider reported previously. Alongside new sanctions from the US targeting Russian oil, major companies like BP, Apple, and McDonald's are ending or suspending business in the country in response to its attack on Ukraine that began last month. Russia's economy has been crumbling in the face of tough sanctions that have targeted its economy and financial system. The sanctions have included freezing hundreds of billions of dollars worth of the central bank's foreign currency assets and blocking Russian banks from the SWIFT payments system.

3/11/2022,"An avalanche buried a snowmobiler fully in the snow — except for one hand sticking out from the debris. The snowmobiler set out Monday, March 7, to ride with four friends near Whitney Reservoir, a body of water in northeast Utah. The 44-year-old from Morgan was carried away in an avalanche and buried in the snow, the Summit County Sheriff said. The man’s friends began searching for him, deputies said. “The friends quickly located him because his hand was sticking out of the snow where he was buried,” Lt. Andrew Wright told McClatchy News in an email. “They quickly dug him out and found him unconscious.” A Life Flight helicopter was sent, but the snowmobiler regained consciousness and was able to walk when rescuers arrived, Wright said. The man refused medical attention and appeared to be OK, deputies said. “As we get new, fresh snow, it’s a good reminder to check avalanche conditions, take proper equipment, and avoid avalanche prone areas,” officials said on Facebook. Deputies did not say what caused the avalanche, but avalanches can happen quickly and catch people by surprise. Avalanches can move between 60 and 80 mph and typically happen on slopes of 30-45 degrees, according to officials. They can be triggered by a change in the weather or by people recreating on a slope, officials said. Skiers, snowmobilers and hikers can set off an avalanche when a layer of snow collapses and starts to slide down the slope. In the U.S., avalanches are most common from December to April, but they can happen at any time if the conditions are right, National Geographic reported. At least 11 people in the U.S. have died in avalanches this season as of March 9, according to the Colorado Avalanche Information Center.

3/11/2022,"Stephen Colbert spotted one of the most unbelievable acts of resistance as Ukraine battles an invasion by Russia. The “Late Show” host read this tweet on Tuesday night: That provided an opportunity for Colbert to reach into his joke jar for some instant Vlasic puns. “That’s right! Ukrainian grandmothers have weaponized pickles ― and they’re not gherkin around,” he said. “Here’s the dill-io: Mess with Ukraine, and they will relish the opportunity to hit you with a pickle spear. Or even worse, drop a tactical cuke.” Once fact-checkers looked into the story, however, they found one key detail was wrong, and Colbert had to revise all those jokes in his Tuesday night monologue: This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.",World/HuffPost,Stephen Colbert Spots The Weirdest Weapon Ukraine Has Used Against Russia,https://news.yahoo.com/stephen-colbert-spots-weirdest-weapon-070222947.html

3/11/2022,"Barely two weeks into the brutal war in Ukraine, one question has arisen: Which countries are involved in the fighting? On paper, there are only two armies lobbing artillery shells and ammunition at each other: Russia and Ukraine. But the confusion about what constitutes a country joining the fight deepened this week, after the U.K. military reported that a 19-year-old serviceman had gone AWOL from his post in the Coldstream Guards—an elite unit that services Queen Elizabeth at Windsor Castle—and was apparently headed to fight in Ukraine. British tabloid newspaper The Sun reported that the soldier, whose name is being withheld, was one of four active military servicemen who had absconded to go fight in Ukraine. According to the paper, he wrote to his parents before he left, telling them that he was buying a one-way ticket to Poland, the main entry point into Ukraine, whose airports have been shut since Russia invaded the country on Feb. 24. Ukraine’s besieged government formed an international legion on Feb. 27, appealing for volunteers to bolster their military strength against the far bigger Russian forces. “Together we defeated Hitler, and we will defeat Putin too,” tweeted Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, in announcing the foreign-fighters unit. The foreign minister said on the weekend that about 20,000 volunteers from 52 countries have signed up, and Ukraine’s embassies report they have seen a steady stream of people seeking documentation allowing them to travel to the war front to join the fight. Facebook groups have sprung up to guide prospective fighters through the process of signing up; one Facebook group, the French Volunteers in Ukraine group, now has 10,700 members. And on Wednesday, Latvia announced that its Member of Parliament Juris Jurašs had left to fight in Ukraine; the Baltic nation shares a 133-mile border with Russia. Until now, Western countries have stopped short of joining Ukraine’s military fight, focusing their efforts on imposing economic sanctions, and believing that engaging military would transform the conflict into a far broader war in Europe—something that has not occurred in 80 years—from which it could take years to extricate. The fact that active U.K. servicemen might be among them has sparked deep anxiety in the government. It has banned active-duty military from joining Ukraine’s volunteers. A friend of the missing Queen’s guardsman told The Sun that the serviceman had grown tired of ceremonial duties at Windsor Castle, where the guards march in formation outside the castle, dressed in ornate uniforms topped with their famous bearskin hats. “You don’t join the army to stand in bearskin hats and march about,” the guardsman told the paper. “You join it to fight and see action.” The U.K. Ministry of Defense repeated its warning against servicemen joining the fight in Ukraine, saying they would face “disciplinary and administrative consequences.” This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",World/Fortune,How AWOL British soldier could draw U.K. into conflict with Russia,https://news.yahoo.com/awol-british-soldier-could-draw-145221041.html
3/11/2022,"Yellowstone National Park turns 150 years old this month — a milestone truly worth celebrating. When Westerners think of Yellowstone, probably what comes to mind are its grizzlies, exploding geysers, wolf packs and bitraffic jams, not to mention bubbling, iridescent hot pools that attract swarms of visitors from all over the world. The park is a jewel of the Northern Rockies, but to this journalist who has covered its stories for 35 years, the real miracle of Yellowstone is its intricate world of wildlife. Yet any discussion of wildlife here comes wrapped in a paradox. Despite Covid-19, or perhaps because of it, in 2021 Yellowstone smashed monthly, seasonal and annual visitation records, notching nearly 4.9 million visits. That is 860,000 more than in 2019, the year before the pandemic struck. This year, given social media and marketing aimed at the park’s 150th anniversary, it’s possible that Yellowstone could surpass the 5 million mark. More: Proposed Lincoln National Forest management plan in conflict with Eddy County priorities Even if it doesn’t hit that milestone, many locals who have visited the park for decades say its roads and its capacity for serving visitors are already overwhelmed, as are many public facilities in the gateway towns of Idaho, Montana and Wyoming. Although the crushing visitation happens on a tiny percent of parkland, all these curious tourists create waves of troubling ripple effects. Yellowstone is neither a standalone island nor a drive-through zoo. It is unique, the last ecosystem in the Lower 48 to contain all of the original mammal species that were on the landscape before Europeans arrived on the continent. Now, based on the diversity and health of its wildlife populations, Yellowstone is wilder than it was in 1872, when poachers, bounty, and market hunters nearly wiped out all wildlife in the country. Grizzly bears have been rescued from a population free fall. Wolves were brought back by the Interior Department under Bruce Babbitt in the mid-1990s, and the park’s bison population, which numbered just 23 at one point in the late 19th century, is at 5,000. Had Yellowstone not been created, had winter range beyond Yellowstone not existed, and had environmental protection laws not been put in place, it’s doubtful that those original species would have survived. Many biologists think most would have been lost. Not all are celebrating Yellowstone’s birth. Some have portrayed the park as an emblem of injustice that resulted in the removal of Indigenous people from native homelands. These critics see a park which non-white citizens say they have never felt invited to embrace as part of their heritage. This needs to be addressed by the National Park Service and remedied. More: Meet Carlsbad Caverns National Park's new superintendent Carmen Chapin What cannot be repaired, once broken, are the fragile threads of biological connections holding the ecosystem together. And those connections extend for miles outside the park boundaries, through migration trails and rivers. These days, the boom in outdoor recreation in the West has been crowding the park’s adjacent national forests. The high numbers rival public-land use levels around Moab, Utah’s Wasatch, and the Front Range of the Colorado Rockies, places that don’t have Yellowstone’s diversity of wildlife. Another threat is that neighboring states like Montana have promoted the killing of park wolves and bison when they cross Yellowstone’s invisible boundary. Private lands surrounding Yellowstone are also getting built up, transformed by mostly unplanned development. Such development is the biggest threat to the survival of grizzlies and other park species, warns Chris Servheen, who served as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s national director of grizzly bear recovery for 35 years. Wild animals always suffer when roads, houses and people move into their territories, Servheen says. Coexistence may be the goal, but humans always win any dispute with wildlife trying to survive. Five years ago, Dave Hallac, who managed the science division at the park, told me he was worried not just about the Yellowstone ecosystem suffering “death by 1,000 cuts,” but death by 10,000 scratches, as more people scramble for their piece of paradise. The trend has only accelerated. What is the most enduring “value” of Yellowstone? The park reveals that humans deeply appreciate this special place of wildness. But the park also has an urgent message to those same humans: Our consumption of wild places means we must deliberately decide to accept limits. This is a good thing—and an increasingly rare thing.

3/11/2022,"An Ukrainian protester in the occupied city of Kherson said Russian armed forces are scared. The port city was the first major city to fall to Russia last Wednesday. Since the invasion, scores of demonstrators have taken to Kherson's streets in protest. A Ukrainian protester in the occupied city of Kherson said Russian forces are ""really scared"" of demonstrators who have taken to the streets since the city was invaded last week. In a promotional video posted to YouTube on Wednesday, an unnamed man in the city of Kherson described the Ukrainian response to Russian tanks in the city center. The video, titled ""Kherson is Ukraine,"" was posted by Kherson Now, a video channel that publishes ""socially relevant events and stories of Kherson,"" according to the channel. ""The people are ready to pull together, and even if it is necessary to arm themselves and drive the enemy out of our land,"" the man said in the video. Kherson, a key southern city along the Black Sea, was the first major city to fall to Russia on March 2. Home to nearly 300,000 people, the strategic port was besieged by Russian troops and tanks following days of fighting in the area that left approximately 300 Ukrainians dead, according to government officials. Since the city was seized last week, hundreds of Ukrainians have taken to the streets to protest the Russian occupation. Over the weekend, the city's mayor estimated that nearly 2,000 people attended a protest in Liberty Square, according to The New York Times. Video clips included in the Kherson Now video show scores of people draped in Ukrainian flags chanting and standing defiant against Russian troops. ""They are afraid of us so they put up fortifications,"" the narrator said, gesturing to a line of tanks parked some yards away from the crowd of demonstrators. ""When I was there, I was talking to the soldiers, they were really scared,"" he added. The man said the Russian troops threatened to shoot if protesters stormed the administration. A separate video reviewed by Insider showed Russian troops attempting to disperse crowds by firing into the air during a previous demonstration. ""They really know that people can't be stopped,"" the man in the Kherson Now video said. Still, he added, Ukrainian people are afraid themselves as well. ""Do not believe anyone who says we are not afraid of assault rifles that shot at us,"" he said. ""We are not afraid of provocations... we are afraid."" But despite that fear, he said Ukrainians are prepared to fight. ""We are ready for absolutely any scenarios and will resist any Russian scenarios,"" he said. Ukraine's military high command said on Wednesday that more than 400 protesters in Kherson had been detained by Russia's National Guard, according to Reuters.
