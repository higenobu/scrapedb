3/1/2022,"Russia’s invasion and bombing campaign has sparked outrage, with many in the UK asking how they can help the people of Ukraine. There are several Ukrainian charities working on the ground. Sunflower of Peace is a charity that helps paramedics and doctors, and has been fundraising for supplies, which includes first aid medical tactical backpacks. United Help Ukraine focuses on providing medical supplies and humanitarian aid, and raising awareness of the conflict. Voices of Children aims to help children affected by the war in eastern Ukraine, providing support through art therapy, psychologists, video storytelling and a number of other methods. The British Red Cross has launched an emergency appeal to help Ukraine. The charity will be updating its webpage with news on the work its team is doing, and how support will be used to help people. English-language news outlets based in the country, such as Kyiv Independent and the New Voice of Ukraine, are covering developments on the ground as the conflict unfolds, using local journalists. The Kyiv Independent says it was created by journalists in order to defend editorial independence. This site on Twitter covers many local journalists in Ukraine.

3/1/2022,"Good morning. Russia is not showing any signs of easing up its attack on Ukraine. More than 70 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in the eastern city of Okhtyrka after a Russian missile strike on a military base, in what is thought to be the biggest loss of life in a single incident in Moscow’s invasion. The death toll – reported by Ukrainian officials in the city – follows a sharp intensification of the Russian bombardment of Ukrainian cities, including the use of multiple-launch rocket systems against civilian areas, which has led to increasing casualties. Meanwhile, Satellite images taken yesterday show a Russian military convoy north of Kyiv that stretches for about 40 miles (64km) in an area north-west of Kyiv. It is substantially longer than the 17 miles (27km) reported earlier in the day, according to the US company Maxar. What do we know on day six of Russia’s invasion? At least nine people have been killed, including three children, and 37 wounded in one day after the shelling in the Kharkiv, the city’s mayor said. Here’s what else we know. Has Russia committed war crimes? There are grounds for an investigation, according to the prosecutor of the international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague. He has announced that he will launch an investigation into possible war crimes or crimes against humanity in Ukraine. Donald Trump’s legal troubles are continuing to drag on. The former president has appealed against a judge’s decision requiring he answer questions under oath in New York state’s civil investigation into his business practices – a widely expected move that’s likely to prolong the fight over his testimony by months. Lawyers for the former president and his two eldest children filed papers on Monday with the appellate division of the state’s trial court, seeking to overturn Manhattan judge Arthur Engoron’s 17 February ruling. They argue ordering the Trumps to testify violates their constitutional rights because their answers could be used in a parallel criminal investigation. In an eight-page ruling, Engoron set a 10 March deadline for Trump and his children, Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr, to sit for depositions. Lawyers for the Trumps asked the appellate court for a stay to spare them from questioning while it considers the matter. When will the court hear the arguments? The court did not set a date for arguments. It typically issues decisions several months after that, but could be inclined to rule on an expedited basis given the urgency of New York attorney general Letitia James’ investigation and the Trumps’ desire to swiftly overturn Engoron’s ruling. The Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine is less effective in children aged five to 11 than in adolescents and adults, according to data from New York state health officials. The research was announced shortly after federal authorities relaxed masking guidance and a day after Eric Adams, the mayor of New York, said he would probably follow governor Kathy Hochul in ending a mask mandate in city schools. The study was carried out during the Omicron variant surge but was made public at a time of rapidly dropping cases and hospitalizations in New York and elsewhere. In the study released yesterday, not yet peer-reviewed, six New York state public health scientists analyzed cases and hospitalization rates from 13 December 2021 to 30 January 2022 among 852,384 fully vaccinated children aged 12 to 17 and 365,502 fully vaccinated children aged five to 11. What did the study find? Results revealed that vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization during the Omicron variant surge declined from 85% to 73% for children aged 12 to 17. Among children aged five to 11, effectiveness fell even more significantly, from 100% to 48%. Nasa is exploring ways to keep the international space station in orbit without Russian help, but does not see any immediate signs Moscow is withdrawing from the collaboration. The space agency says Northrop Grumman and SpaceX could assist after Russia raises the prospect of pulling out over sanctions punishing its invasion of Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has prompted responses from the cultural sphere, with Russian artists feeling the repercussions of decisions taken by the Kremlin. Performances and exhibitions are being cancelled across the world including at the Venice Biennale and Royal Opera House. Pressure is mounting on Israel to conclude the trial of a Gazan aid worker accused of funnelling relief money to Hamas in a six-year-old case widely derided as “not worthy of a democratic state”. Mohammed El Halabi, remains in detention, despite serious flaws in the Israeli case. Cartier sued Tiffany & Co yesterday, accusing its luxury rival of stealing trade secrets concerning its high-end jewelry from an employee it lured away. Tiffany is accused of hiring away an underqualified junior manager to learn more about Cartier’s “High Jewelry” collection, where pieces typically cost $50,000 to $10m. Carbon emissions from tropical deforestation this century are far higher than previously thought, doubling in just two decades and continuing to accelerate, according to a study. The findings contrast with previous assessments, such as the Global Carbon Budget 2021, which had suggested a slight decline in carbon loss from deforestation. Since 2000, the world has lost about 10% of its tree cover, becoming a major driver of global heating. Joe Biden will deliver his first State of the Union address today before a bitterly divided Congress, seeking to inspire a pandemic-weary nation deeply unhappy with its leaders and government, while projecting strength to the world after Russia unleashed the largest land war in Europe since the second world war. The prime-time address comes at a precarious moment for Biden and the world, writes Lauren Gambino. With each passing day, it is becoming clearer that Putin’s gamble is failing, writes Yuval Noah Harari. The Ukrainian people are resisting with all their heart, winning the admiration of the entire world – and winning the war. Many dark days lie ahead. The Russians may still conquer the whole of Ukraine. But to win the war, the Russians would have to hold Ukraine, and they can do that only if the Ukrainian people let them. This seems increasingly unlikely to happen. Climate scientists from around the world issued dire warnings , in the latest IPCC report on the dangers posed in the unfolding climate crisis. Among them is extreme heat, a crisis that on average already claims more American lives than hurricanes and tornadoes combined. Some policymakers and environmentalists are pushing for new ranking systems to help elevate awareness around the issue or assign heatwaves names, much like federal agencies do for hurricanes. Urban dwellers tolerate screeching subways, traffic and noisy bars. But late-night sounds of coital revelry are the breaking point, according to data. A wave of “sex mayhem” has apparently been sweeping New York City, prompting residents to lodge an increasing number of noise complaints to the government helpline. “To get a sense of how disruptive they are, I’ve slept through earthquakes and fires in my life … I couldn’t sleep through this,” one resident wrote last April.

3/1/2022,"The world is frighteningly locked in a battle to the death between democracy and authoritarianism. On Sunday Vladimir Putin issued a new threat to the west – telling his defense minister and his top military commander to place Russia’s nuclear forces on alert. It is a new cold war. The biggest difference between the old cold war and the new one is that authoritarian neo-fascism is no longer just an external threat to America and Europe. A version of it is also growing inside western Europe and the US. It has even taken over one of America’s major political parties. The Trump-led Republican party does not openly support Putin, but the Republican party’s animus toward democracy is expressed in ways familiar to Putin and other autocrats. Trump Republicans continue to refuse to acknowledge the outcome of the 2020 election, claiming without evidence that it was “stolen” from Trump. In many states, on the basis of this big lie, they are making it more difficult for people who don’t share their beliefs to vote. In several states they are laying the groundwork for ignoring the popular vote altogether and throwing a future presidential election to Trump or another strongman. They have stopped even pretending to be the party of free speech: they are banning books from schools and prohibiting teachers from talking about America’s struggles against racism and homophobia. Putin’s attack on Ukraine, starting 24 February, and the attack by followers of Donald Trump on the United States Capitol on 6 January 2021 are different, of course, but they resemble one another in their contempt for democratic institutions and their attempts to justify violence by asserting a threat to a dominant racial or ethnic group. Each also represents the logical culmination of leadership by a dangerous narcissist who flagrantly lies about his intentions and his opponents and who sees the world only in terms of his personal power. Donald Trump has long admired Vladimir Putin who, evidence shows, personally authorized a secret spy agency operation to support a “mentally unstable” Trump in the 2016 US presidential election. Believing that a Trump White House would help secure Moscow’s strategic objectives, Russia’s spy agencies were ordered to use “all possible force” to ensure Trump’s victory. Again in the 2020 election, according to a recently unclassified report by the US office of the Director of National Intelligence, Putin authorized “influence operations” aimed at “supporting Trump” and “denigrating President Biden’s candidacy”. Presumably Putin supported Trump in 2016 and in 2020 in part because of Trump’s disdain for Nato. As president, Trump did all he could to undermine the organization, even suggesting the US should withdraw from it. Is it pure coincidence that once Trump was out of office and Nato remained intact, Putin attacked Ukraine? Defending democracy and standing up against authoritarian neo-fascism requires courage. In 2019, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, refused Trump’s demand for help in rigging the 2020 election in the United States, even after Trump threatened to withhold money Congress had appropriated to help Ukraine resist Russian expansion. Today, Zelenskiy won’t be bullied by Putin. He turned down America’s offer to evacuate him, saying: “I need ammunition, not a ride.” Zelenskiy’s courage in the face of overwhelming brute force has fortified Ukrainians now defending their country against invaders. Contrast this with the toadies at the Republican National Committee who in February censured Republican representatives Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois for participating in Congress’s select committee investigating the events of 6 January, and who called the attack on the Capitol “legitimate political discourse”. Also contrast Zelenskiy’s courage with most elected Republicans who still refuse to stand up to Trump. On Sunday, on national television, Senator Tom Cotton refused four times to condemn Trump for calling Putin “smart” and “savvy” and Nato and the US “dumb”. Make no mistake: Putin’s authoritarian neo-fascism has rooted itself in America. It may be possible to prevent Putin’s aggression from spreading to the rest of Europe. But it is not possible to win a cold civil war inside America without destroying the United States – another of Putin’s objectives when he ordered his spy agencies to help Trump. In the months and years ahead, those of us in the west who believe in democracy, the rule of law, human rights and truth, must do everything we can to win back our fellow countrymen to these same overriding values.

3/1/2022,"Just over a month after the late Virgil Abloh’s final presentation for Louis Vuitton, the designer’s instalment for his personal brand Off-White opened Paris autumn-winter 2022 fashion week. The event – which was livestreamed in nearly 100 French selling points – was a poignant realisation of the hard work Abloh delivered in the final stages of his life, before his death from cancer in November 2021. Suffice it to say, his personal touch was present in every detail. In the symbolically charged halls of the former Paris stock exchange was held a show entitled Spaceship Earth: An “Imaginary Experience”, meant to evoke the arenas of historic world fairs. The setting visually and symbolically brought together cultures long held distinct: there was a magnified replica of the chandelier of the historic Hotel Majestic opposite a wall of loudspeakers – complete with a performance by Jeff Mills, pioneer of Detroit techno. This meeting of contrasting worlds continued in the deployment of three intertwined and oddly complementary themes: namely an exploration of sexiness – through party girl bling era minidresses, apparent thongs poking out of low-rise jeans, fit for the current Y2K revival. That was followed by a rereading of men’s tailoring, with skateboard-inspired lines and volumes, such as a shell jacket constructed from canvas, graffiti jacquard and intricately crafted blousons. And finally, an entire segment unveiled Off-White’s “skiwear line”, which came complete with kitten heeled snow-boots, tech pile pieces and a functional wardrobe fit for the slopes as well as the club. Walking in front of Rihanna, A$AP Rocky and Pharrell Williams, models held white flags spelling out the words “question everything”. A coup de théâtre awaited guests after the first part of the show:​ on the catwalk, the launch of what the press release described as an “Off-White high fashion collection” took place, consisting of a “couture-like” endeavour entitled “>Than a Bride”. Although the brand doesn’t hold the haute couture title, it follows one of Abloh’s longstanding passions. He had previously concluded his shows with couture-standard dresses – and chosen to present past ready-to-wear collections during the Paris couture week. Each look was built into a distinct characters such as “the Fangirl”, the “New York City Ballet”, “the Stripper” or “the Carrie B”. Opening the section was “the Bride”, donning a white silk taffeta dress, pulled up at the front to “evoke the gesture of a girl pulling up her skirt to dance at a party”, worn by Bella Hadid, holding her heels in her hands and coiffed with a veiled baseball cap. Overbearing tulle came mixed with a vintage T-shirt; a bustier embroidered in rhinestones was paired with shorts and accessorised with a BABE-embroidered cigarette case. In the world of Abloh, haute couture becomes “haute couture” and inevitably questions its contours. The collection poses the question of the future of Off-White without its creator. The house has indicated that nobody is planned to replace Abloh, aiming at a more collective approach. Recently, executives from LVMH (holder of most of the brand) and New Guards (the co-founding group behind Off-White) revealed the rich material left by the creator. This, as was said at Business of Fashion, will allow “harnessing his legacy to build a multibillion-dollar brand”.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Poignant Virgil Abloh Off-White show opens Paris fashion week,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/01/poignant-virgil-abloh-off-white-show-opens-paris-fashion-week
3/1/2022,"Texas voters are heading to the polls on Tuesday in the first primary contest of the US 2022 midterm elections. The state attorney general, Ken Paxton, a staunch Donald Trump ally who has the former president’s endorsement, is seeking the Republican nomination for a third term in office. Paxton, who has been under indictment since 2015 and faces whistleblower accusations of misusing his office, is running against a number of GOP challengers, including George P Bush, the son of Jeb Bush and nephew of George W Bush. Bush and Paxton’s other challengers are hoping to push him to a runoff election in May. Races go to a runoff in Texas if no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote. Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, one of the most conservative Republicans in the country, is expected to win his party’s nomination for a third term. Democrats are likely to nominate Beto O’Rourke, who narrowly lost a 2018 US Senate bid before his failed presidential campaign in 2020. On the Democratic side, the most closely watched race is between Henry Cuellar, a longtime conservative Democrat in south Texas, and his progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros, who is backed by Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez. The race is a rematch of 2020, when Cuellar, whose home and office were raided by FBI investigators in January, narrowly defeated Cisneros. When Republicans redrew the district as part of the redistricting process last year, they excised some of the portions where Cisneros performed the most strongly in 2020. The races are being watched as an early signal of the political temperature in the US. Texas is one of the fastest-growing states in the country and 95% of the growth over the last decade has been from people of color. Democrats have not won a statewide election in Texas since 1994, but many see it as increasingly politically competitive. Whichever candidates ultimately prevail in the congressional primaries are highly likely to win in November. When Republicans redrew Texas’s 38 congressional districts last year, they reduced the number of competitive districts from 12 to just one. The single remaining competitive district in the general election is the 15th congressional district, which stretches from outside San Antonio to the border city of McAllen in the south-east. Numerous challenges to the congressional map are pending in court. One of the biggest stories of the primary so far has been the staggering impact of new voting restrictions. The primary is the first in the state in which new sweeping voting restrictions will be in effect. For weeks, election officials have reported widespread issues with implementing the law’s provisions on mail-in ballots. A new requirement that voters note either their state ID or last four digits of their social security numbers is causing tens of thousands of ballots to be rejected. In El Paso county, at the western end of the Texas-Mexico border, officials have rejected 27% of the 3,855 ballots they received so far, almost all because of issues related to the new state law, according to numbers provided by Lisa Wise, the county elections administrator. In Harris county, the most populous in the state, officials said they had flagged 10,876 ballots – 29% of those returned – for rejection as of Saturday. Leah Shah, a spokesperson for the election office, said the county planned to call voters whose information they had on file to try and get voters to correct any issues with their ballots. The rejection numbers are staggeringly high. In the 2020 election, Texas officials reported rejecting less than 1% of ballots statewide.

3/1/2022,"Fast food workers in California are fighting to pass a first of its kind bill that would provide employees with the power to negotiate wages and possibly improve working condition standards across the industry. The Fast Recovery Act, or AB 257, would create a statewide fast food sector council that would include workers, state regulators, franchises and their parent companies and set wage and other standards for the industry. The act would also hold franchises and their parent corporations more accountable to labor laws. Workers say the legislation is a means to fight low pay, poor working conditions, and a lack of safety protections – problems that have long plagued the industry but that workers say have worsened during the pandemic. “There are a lot of laws protecting workers but nobody is implementing or doing anything about it. We are essential workers but not treated like that. With the Fast Recovery Act, we’ll be heard. We’ll sit down at the same table with all the franchises and say if there is a law protecting workers, it has to be followed and applied,” said Maria Yolanda Torres, who has worked at a Subway store in San Jose, California, since May 2018. Throughout the pandemic, Yolanda Torres alleges, she and her colleagues have been forced to skip breaks and work off the clock, had tips stolen, had sick pay taken away, and faced safety problems, including abusive customers, that were ignored by the store’s owners. The owners did not enforce Covid-19 regulations or protect workers when customers refused to abide by them, Yolanda Torres alleged. She was asked to climb into the store dumpster to stomp the garbage bags down so they all fit into one overflowing dumpster, she said. “It’s a lot of garbage. It’s disgusting and it’s not safe. If we fall down, the owner wouldn’t pay me if I got hurt. The owner only wants to pay for the one dumpster when we need two,” she said. When sick pay didn’t show up on her paycheck, the owner and managers refused to resolve the issue, she said. Yolanda and three of her co-workers at Subway in February filed a wage theft complaint with the California department of labor. They also filed health complaints with CalOSHA, the state’s division of occupational safety and health, alleging various forms of wage theft incurred by the four workers for a total of more than $41,000. The Subway franchise owner received PPP loans and Covid-19 grants totaling more than $285,000, according to a copy of the complaints provided to the Guardian. Subway and the franchise owner, Rajiv Kohli, did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the complaints. Yolanda Torres said working conditions like the ones she experienced are common in the industry. “Workers are facing similar issues across fast food franchises in the state, but the owners don’t care about the consequences,” she said. “When owners realize we know our rights and that somebody is listening, the problems are going to be resolved.” A recent survey of fast food workers in Los Angeles, conducted by the UCLA Labor Center, found workers reported lack of paid sick leave, widespread lack of enforcement of Covid-19 safety protocols and economic insecurity; 44% of workers surveyed reported not having enough money to afford groceries during the pandemic; 43% reported missing rent or a mortgage payment; 47% of workers reported working more than one job to try to make ends meet. Among workers who said they had expressed workplace concerns to their managers, 25% said they had experienced retaliation for doing so. Jose Ramirez, a worker at McDonald’s in San Francisco for three years, was terminated on 8 February due to what he alleges was retaliation for advocating for Covid-19 sick pay for himself and co-workers who were not receiving it. He filed a complaint with the California department of labor standards enforcement alleging the firing was retaliation and provided a copy of the complaint. In February 2021, a McDonald’s franchisee in Los Angeles, California, was fined $125,000 by the state for illegally firing four workers for reporting Covid-19 safety issues. “We need to keep pushing to make AB 257 law and that law will protect all the workers in fast food. I believe if AB 257 was law already, my employer wouldn’t carry out firing me just because I spoke out and demanded my rights as a worker,” said Ramirez. “Only united as workers will we be strong enough to fight against all the bad practices in the fast food industry.” The McDonald’s franchise owner and operator Scott Rodrick declined to comment on Ramirez’s case. “My organization does not tolerate retaliation of any kind against our employees. We have not received an inquiry from the California department of labor regarding this allegation. Thus, we cannot comment on this particular employment matter,” said Rodrick in an email. “We do, however, firmly believe in creating a safe working environment for all of our employees, including adhering to our high standards for Covid safety as we all work together to help contain the pandemic. Everyone working within my organization has the obligation to uphold those safety standards.” California has more than 550,000 fast food workers, according to estimates, more than any state in the US. The bill, whose regulations would be limited to fast food restaurants with at least 30 franchises across the US, passed in the California Assembly on 31 January and is awaiting a vote in the Senate. But the bill faces strong opposition from groups who argue the proposal would grant the council too much power. The bill “just drives entire franchises and franchise brands away from California,” Republican assemblyman Kelly Seyarto told the Associated Press. Democratic assemblyman Chris Holden, a former franchisee himself, told the AP the bill gives the state “a chance to lead the country and address outstanding issues in the fast food industry”. “It is about fairness and it is about bringing all the responsible parties to the table to collaborate on solutions.”",News/US news,‘We’ll be heard’: California could grant fast food workers unprecedented power ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/01/california-fast-food-workers-bill-fast-recovery-act
3/1/2022,"When Hurricane Irma ravaged south Florida in September 2017 it inundated homes, knocked out electricity for millions and killed more than 30 people. The devastation was not confined to humans, however. In the Florida Keys, one of the state’s most beloved animals also took a beating: the Key deer, a small subspecies of white-tailed deer that evolved in peaceful isolation on the islands and is now protected under the Endangered Species Act. Irma drowned them, slammed them into buildings and dragged them out to sea. “With Irma, we probably lost about 30% of the deer,” said Nova Silvy, a zoologist who has studied the deer since the 1960s on Big Pine Key, where most of them live. Though the deer population has largely bounced back, the hurricane’s toll foreshadowed the dangerous future faced by this animal. In the coming century, the impacts of the climate crisis, especially sea level rise, will probably inundate many of the Florida Keys, including the endangered deer’s core habitat on Big Pine Key and neighboring islands. Despite this bleak outlook, the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), which administers the Endangered Species Act, has been working on proposals in recent years that would strip the Key deer of its endangered species status – even as the agency’s own scientists have highlighted the threat of rising sea levels to the deer’s habitat, according to records obtained by the Guardian and Type Investigations. These efforts began under the Trump administration, which oversaw a concerted effort to remove protections for imperiled species, and they have outraged conservationists as well as some former FWS officials, who have opposed the agency’s attempt to remove protections for the Key deer. “There are things happening [to the Key deer] down there that would raise flags for any animal,” said Tom Wilmers, a retired FWS biologist who spent years working with the Key deer. “And yet the agency is in denial. I just don’t understand how delisting or downlisting that animal helps anybody.” More broadly, however, the plight of the Key deer is a window into the Fish and Wildlife Service’s broader failure to adequately protect endangered species threatened by the climate crisis. Most notably, an obscure but consequential legal memo from 2008, signed by top interior department officials at the end of the George W Bush administration, effectively absolves the FWS and other federal agencies that decline to regulate greenhouse gas pollution that harms endangered and threatened animals under the Endangered Species Act. As the law’s leading enforcer, FWS’s inaction is especially consequential. “We are putting out ten gigatons of carbon emissions per year, plus or minus, and those emissions are causing the planet to warm. And we know as the planet warms a lot of things are happening, from extreme weather events to waterways being ice-free for longer,” said Stuart Pimm, a professor of conservation at Duke University. “They may not be quite as direct as someone going out with a shotgun and killing a bald eagle, but they are every bit as potent a factor in causing species extinctions.” Presidential administrations have legal latitude to rescind the memo, but neither the Obama nor Trump administrations did so. Now, a group of scientists and conservationists, including Pimm, are calling on the Biden administration to take action by empowering the FWS to better protect imperiled species – not just Key deer, but polar bears, sea turtles and more – from the climate emergency. Until the White House does so, they say, the Endangered Species Act will remain hobbled when it comes to tackling one of the biggest threats that endangered species face. The Key deer was supposed to be a conservation success story. By the mid-20th century the subspecies had been hunted to near extinction, leaving only a few dozen deer left, when the federal government established a wildlife refuge around Big Pine Key and listed the animal under the Endangered Species Act. From there the little deer made a comeback, and according to surveys conducted in 2020, they now number about 750 individuals or more. On a windy spring day on Big Pine Key, Chris Bergh, a scientist and the south Florida program manager for the Nature Conservancy, points to the desiccated grey remains of several dead trees. Bergh has studied the impact of sea level rise on the Florida Keys ecosystem for more than 15 years. The pines that once stood here, he said, have retreated as rising ocean water slowly shrinks the precious freshwater pools that sustain the island’s wildlife. Indeed, even before the rising ocean fully drowns the Key deer’s home range, salt water contamination will ruin their drinking holes. Whether in 50 years or 100, the deer’s island habitat is probably doomed – so it would seem the deer are more in need than ever of the federal protections granted under the Endangered Species Act. But the FWS has taken a different view. On 13 August 2019, its southeast regional director, Leo Miranda, drafted a memo to the agency’s top official at the time, “proposing to delist the Florida Key deer”. “This determination,” he wrote, “is based on the best available scientific and commercial information, which indicates that the threats to this species have been eliminated or reduced to the point that the species no longer meets the definition of an endangered or threatened species.” He justified his proposal by citing the deer’s high population numbers and arguing that “there are uncertainties regarding what effects changes in sea-level will have on Florida Key deer habitat … before inundation” from rising waters. A year earlier, though, FWS’s own scientists were already warning that sea level rise could imperil the deer’s habitat. In a draft research paper obtained by the Guardian and Type Investigations, the scientists drew on a range of existing research, including studies conducted by other federal agencies, to conclude that Key West could see between three and nine feet of sea level rise by 2100. In one set of scenarios modeled in that research, low-lying areas in south Florida like Big Pine Key would be mostly inundated between 2060 and 2080. That degree of sea level rise would wipe out the deer’s core habitat. “The Florida Keys are going underwater due to sea level rise (SLR),” the paper’s authors wrote in an early version of the paper. “All SLR scenarios agree and depict this to happen.” The paper featured an image of what Big Pine Key could look like in the future: a tiny spit of land and a few squat mangrove trees standing above rising waters. The draft research paper was circulated among agency staff, including Miranda, as early as August 2018. Nevertheless, FWS proceeded with its effort to remove the deer from the endangered species list until late summer 2019, according to documents obtained by Type Investigations and the Guardian through a public records request. “I don’t know why they would do that – start writing a delisting rule at a point in time where you have the agency staff raising concerns,” said Karimah Schoenhut, a Sierra Club attorney who works on Key deer issues. “Agency scientists were pointing out sea level rise issues, saying there is no way you can delist species.” Eventually, FWS backed away from the delisting plan, after the US Geological Survey found in a report that FWS had failed to take into account research that “would suggest an even greater risk to Key deer and its habitat than included in” FWS’s assessment of the deer’s status. But the agency didn’t entirely give up. Instead, it began planning to downlist the deer from “endangered” to “threatened”, a lesser classification that would not offer as much protection for the imperiled species. Internal communications obtained by the Guardian and Type Investigations show this plan remained a priority for top Trump administration officials at the interior department, but they failed to get the job done before Biden took over. Last summer, the FWS’s scientific integrity officer concluded that the agency’s official assessment on which it based its downlisting plans did not use the “best available scientific information” and suggested that it should “not be used for decision-making”. As of January 2022, FWS was back at the drawing board, having initiated a new assessment of the Key deer’s status the previous summer, according to a statement the agency sent to the Guardian and Type Investigations. The animal’s future status as an endangered species remains up in the air. Even if the Key deer does retain some federal protection, however, the FWS’s responsibility to protect animals from rising sea levels remains significantly curtailed – thanks in part to a legal memo issued during the final months of the George W Bush administration. Observers say the Endangered Species Act could be a powerful tool in the fight against climate change. Under section 7, FWS has the authority to review projects undertaken, funded, or permitted by the federal government if they are likely to harm a protected species. If such projects jeopardize the survival of the species, the agency can force changes or prohibit them altogether. Environmental groups say this gives the FWS leverage to curtail fossil fuel projects or other programs whose emissions contribute to the climate crisis and threaten endangered animals. In 2008, however, David Bernhardt, the interior department’s top lawyer at the time, signed an internal memo that effectively absolved FWS of responsibility under section 7 to regulate the climate change impacts of greenhouse gas emissions. The memo stated that: “Where the effects at issue result from climate change potentially induced by [greenhouse gases], a proposed action … is not subject to consultation under the Esa and its implementing regulations.” The Bernhardt memo now stands as an obstacle to climate action at FWS. It has allowed agencies including the FWS to avoid making tough decisions on greenhouse gas emissions for more than a decade, undermining the government’s ability to control fossil fuel pollution and protect the Key deer, polar bears, shorebirds, sea turtles and other species that face existential danger from melting sea ice, rising temperatures and disappearing habitats. In 2020, for instance, the Trump administration relied in part on the Bernhardt memo to avoid an endangered species consultation on its decision to scrap the Obama-era vehicle emissions standards. (Bernhardt served as interior secretary in the Trump administration.) Environmental groups hope Biden will change course. In February 2021, a group of top researchers, scientists and academics, including Pimm, wrote Biden asking him to rescind the Bernhardt memo. They urged the agency to more fully consider greenhouse gas pollution as a threat to species protected by the Endangered Species Act. That would mean the climate danger to listed animals like the Key deer could provide a legal basis to apply the Esa in a new way to federally sanctioned fossil fuel projects – this in turn could lead to reform, including to the interior department’s vast oil and gas leasing programs. Fossil fuel production on public lands is the ultimate source of roughly a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. “Climate change is the consummate challenge of our time,” said Dr Steven Amstrup, a signatory on the conservationists’ letter to Biden and chief scientist for Polar Bears International. “The US Fish and Wildlife Service should rescind the Bernhardt memo and, as the Esa requires, start addressing the existential threat greenhouse gas pollution poses to plant and animal species across all habitats.” In response to questions about its continued use of the memo, the FWS said that “the current state of the science is such that we cannot currently establish a causal connection to tie a particular [greenhouse gas]-emitting project to measurable consequences to specific species or critical habitats”. Amstrup disputes that rationale. He argues that in some cases, in fact, it is possible to measure the climate impact of specific fossil fuel projects on imperiled species – such as the sea level rise that threatens Key deer, or the declining sea ice that strands polar bears – by analyzing accumulated CO2 concentrations. The interior department, meanwhile, told the Guardian and Type Investigations that it recognizes “an obligation to consider whether our actions contribute to the climate crisis, including the impacts to threatened and endangered species and their habitats.” It did not say whether it plans to rescind the Bernhardt memo. “I don’t think the Esa by itself is going to solve the climate crisis,” said Brett Hartl, the government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity. But, he added, doing away with the memo “could help support efforts to move [federal agencies] to a much better place”. Bernhardt, for his part, harshly criticized the letter conservationists sent to Biden. “Some of the signatories to this letter like former DOI Solicitor John Leshy and former USGS employee Steven Amstrup are longtime activists, who continue to demand unworkable policies, which are not well grounded in the science or the law,” he wrote in a statement. “If successful their efforts will create additional chaos in the Esa interagency consultation process. As a result, I look forward to seeing whether the Biden administration will bend to their will on withdrawing legal opinion when the Obama administration did not.” Leshy, in response to a request for comment on Bernhardt’s statement, said, “Scientific understanding as well as public consciousness of the close links between climate change and the earth’s rich biodiversity have advanced a great deal since then-Solicitor Bernhardt wrote his opinion in 2008. I expect the Biden administration will take a careful look at the issue his opinion addresses, as it should.” On Big Pine Key, meanwhile, Nova Silvy continues to observe the Key deer as he has done for more than half a century – watching them rebound from near extinction to become a popular draw for tourists. He even has names for some of them – like Alba, a little doe with white legs. But he thinks the climate crisis is their biggest test yet. “Unless we can turn it around, I think we are going to be in deep trouble with these deer,” he said. “I mean, I won’t see it – but my daughter may.” This story was produced in partnership with Type Investigations and supported by the Alicia Patterson Foundation.",News/Environment,How one of Florida’s most beloved animals may be close to climate extinction,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/01/florida-key-deer-endangered-climate-extinction
3/1/2022,"Everyone who enjoys rugby union will have winced at some stage over the weekend. For many it will have been the moment when Italy’s admirable captain, Michele Lamaro, discovered his team would, by the dispiriting letter of the law, have to soldier on with 13 men for an hour against one of the world’s top sides. Alternatively, it might have been the footage of a staggering Tomas Francis rejoining the fray at Twickenham having exhibited precisely the kind of ataxia symptoms that should see players permanently removed. Or maybe it was the frequent long stoppages in both games. Or the time-consuming reset scrums. Or the constant peep of the referee Mike Adamson’s whistle during England v Wales. Or the distracting ebb and flow of water carriers entering the field of play? Or the lack of consistency when the Irish forward Ryan Baird caught his Italian opponent Marco Zanon with the same kind of upright tackle which had led to the Azzurri’s replacement hooker, Hame Faiva, being handed a red card. As it happened the grimmest development of all, Ukraine excepted, was still to come. And shocking it was, too. The preliminary findings of a study by the Australian Sports Brain Bank into the long-term ramifications of concussion in sport have been published, with chronic traumatic encephalopathy discovered in the brains of more than half of the deceased sportspeople examined, including three under the age of 35. Of 21 brains posthumously donated since 2018 by people involved in sports with a risk of repetitive head injury, 12 were found to have CTE lesions while all but one showed some form of neurodegeneration. Which just leaves us with the stark testimony of the former Ireland flanker David Corkery in a powerful, sensitively written interview with Gary Doyle on the RugbyPass site last week. “It gives me shivers when I see the hits in the modern game,” Corkery revealed. “I got so many concussions, I lost count. I’ve suffered from depression for years. The black dog is always in the corner, ready to bark. My depression, is it related to those head injuries? I don’t know.” Rugby clearly has plenty to commend it, too. Where would we be without the Six Nations? But only someone with their eyes and ears closed can possibly fail to appreciate the narrow ledge upon which the sport is now perched. Fail to take the possibility of brain injury seriously enough and the sport is doomed. Go too far the other way in terms of arcane, bolted-on laws and endless penalties and how many people will still want to watch it? It is a precarious position and rugby’s next moves will be critically significant. Because everything we are seeing is intertwined as far as rugby’s public image goes. The Ireland v Italy fixture on Sunday descended into barely watchable farce partly because health and safety has led to the laws governing front-row replacements becoming properly byzantine. Even impressive, multilingual national captains are struggling to grasp them. But how, exactly, does protecting player welfare and upholding the integrity of the game tally with forcing an inferior side to soak up yet more punishment having already lost their first‑choice hooker to a genuine tournament-ending injury? Had Italy fibbed on the teamsheet they must submit 48 hours before kick-off and officially nominated a notional third hooker, they would have been able to retain 14 men. Instead, they were effectively penalised for their honesty and, with no way of avoiding uncontested scrums, had to forfeit another player. The entire championship table could be compromised as a result. What if Ireland now win the title on points difference? Italy might have conceded 50 points anyway but, in years to come, the result on Sunday should carry a permanent asterisk. The whole episode felt wrong. Just as the recent head assessment failures which have even caused some of the sport’s senior officials to roll their eyes in exasperation. Along with the Francis episode, rightly described by the lobby group Progressive Rugby as a “clear and fragrant breach” of head injury assessment protocols, we all continue to await the outcome of the independent investigation into the incident late in the Italy v England Under‑20 game when a visiting match doctor seemed to be seeking to persuade the female referee to allow a possibly injured English player to stay on the field rather than go for an HIA. The longer the uncomfortable silence lasts, the more it will feed the suspicion there is something to hide. Perceptions matter and there is an increasing onus on governing bodies and unions to be as squeaky clean as the players over whom they preside. Many of them, meanwhile, are already understood to be in agreement that endless match interruptions risk “killing the spectacle”. Expect the water carrier regulations, in particular, to be significantly tightened in May. The Dublin shambles, though, is being regarded as an extreme set of circumstances unlikely to be repeated. Which, for now, suggests no law rewrite. Hmm. How many casual viewers had a clue what was going on, never mind the supposed experts? Which raises the question of whether rugby’s stuffy, bloated law-book is entirely fit for purpose. In truth World Rugby and the Six Nations were lucky on two counts at the weekend: first, that Italy made such a gallant fist of impossible circumstances; and second, that Francis did not sustain another obvious heavy blow on his return. But what about all those aggregated subconcussive hits we can’t see? The last thing rugby needs just now is any more own goals.  This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

3/1/2022,"World Rugby has joined a growing list of international sports governing bodies by placing immediate suspensions on Russia and Belarus. The unions from the respective countries have been barred from all international rugby and cross-border club rugby activities until further notice. Furthermore, the Rugby Union of Russia has been suspended from World Rugby membership. This decision, in line with recommendations by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and building on last week’s decision by Rugby Europe to suspend Russia’s home activities in the Rugby Europe Championship, was taken by the World Rugby Executive Committee in order to “protect the rugby family and take a strong stance against the conflict.” In a statement released on Tuesday, World Rugby reiterated its condemnation of “Russia’s aggressive invasion of Ukraine and the facilitation of this action by Belarus. The global rugby family is united in standing in solidarity with everyone affected by these deeply disturbing events and joins the global community in calling for the restoration of peace. “The decision has been taken with the interests of rugby’s values of solidarity, integrity and respect at heart. World Rugby also remains in contact with colleagues at the Ukraine Rugby Federation and has pledged its full support to the rugby community in the country.” Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a source close to the Russian national team said that it was a “sad day” for the sport and that “proud athletes who love nothing more than representing their country were being punished. “There are good people in Russian rugby and no one wants war,” the source said. “Some of the players are worried. It’s a very scary time for everyone. I don’t think anyone thought it would come to this. It’s surreal. We’re all hoping it gets resolved as quickly as possible.” Three days after Russian troops entered Ukraine, Russia’s Rugby Europe Championship match against Georgia in Tbilisi was cancelled. With two defeats from as many matches, Russia were bottom of the log in Europe’s second tier international competition. Russia had not yet qualified for next year’s World Cup in France and this suspension effectively ends their hopes of doing so. A spokesperson for World Rugby told the Guardian: “World Rugby has no Russian sponsorship or planned events hosted in Russia or Belarus. Russia is also not involved in the bidding process for future men’s or women’s Rugby World Cups.” Elsewhere the Rugby Football Union has reportedly contacted Fifa to express its opposition to a proposed name-change of the Russian football team which would see both organisations share the initials ‘RFU’. Fifa had come under criticism for its lukewarm stance against Russia last week, failing to expel its football teams from international tournaments. However, this changed on Monday with Fifa joining Uefa in banning the country from all international and club competitions. The international governing bodies for ice hockey and curling, as well as Formula One, the National Hockey League and the US Soccer Federation are among those organisations which have already placed sanctions on Russian athletes and events.",Sport/Sport,World Rugby joins other sports bodies by suspending Russia and Belarus,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/01/world-rugby-union-joins-other-sports-bodies-by-suspending-russia-and-belarus
3/1/2022,"Some day there will be PhD theses written on the strange anomie of films shot during the pandemic, written so everything basically happens in one house using just a handful of actors. There have already been scads of low-budget horror films in this mode which have trickled out over the last few months, and some are quite interesting and inventive. This one, not so much. A good-looking young couple, Brad (Taye Diggs) and Jess (Jessica Uberuaga), have just bought a house somewhere in the hills above California’s San Fernando Valley. Seen often via drone footage, it is an oddly constructed abode that looks like a cross between geodesic dome and an egg incubator. Meanwhile, the camera spends a lot of time roaming the building’s corridors and empty rooms, like we’re watching an estate agent’s VR tour. That sort of fits given Brad and Jess are small-time developers who buy places like this in order to flip them for profit. In a way, this is a throwback to a whole cycle of films from a few years back in which upwardly mobile young people are punished by supernatural forces for their property greed. Presumably we are meant to feel that the characters here get what they deserve for this sin of acquisition. Their wrongdoing is compounded when they start using a book of incantations they find in a spare room that generates gold coins and creepy, pentacular arrangements of bric-a-brac, as if the house is haunted by a satanic fan of Joseph Beuys. Michael Madsen is also on hand as a previous owner who alludes ominously to his father’s fascination with the occult. Clearly, this will not go well. Eventually things get mildly scary and all those white walls, neutral furniture and plain beige flooring are smothered with lashings of blood. The dialogue is wooden, the performances stilted and it’s all just a bit too pro forma – until a truly upsetting flashback involving the younger Brad’s pet dog. Then the film turns a corner from dreary to repugnant.  The Incarnation is released on 7 March on digital platforms.",Arts/Film,The Incarnation review – haunted-house horror with a property-greed edge,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/01/the-incarnation-review-taye-diggs
