4/26/2022,"TOKYO (AP) — Rescuers said that 10 people who were retrieved Sunday from the frigid sea and the rocky coast of a northern Japanese national park had died, a day after a tour boat with 26 aboard apparently sank in rough waters, triggering questions why it was allowed to sail. The search for the others is still ongoing after the boat sent a distress call on Saturday afternoon saying it was sinking. The location, near the Kashuni Waterfall, is known as a difficult place to maneuver boats because of its rocky coastline and strong tide. There were two crew and 24 passengers, including two children, on the the 19-ton Kazu 1 when it ran into troubles while traveling off the western coast of the Shiretoko Peninsula. The coast guard said the 10 victims — seven men and three women — were adults. The Transport Ministry launched an investigation into the boat’s operator, which had two accidents last year. The ministry said it was looking into safety standards and the decision to conduct the tour despite rough weather on Saturday. The operator, Shiretoko Pleasure Cruise, had been instructed to take steps to improve its safety following earlier accidents in which it ran aground in June without causing injuries, and another in May, when three passengers suffered minor injuries when the boat collided with an object. “We will thoroughly investigate what caused this situation and what kind of safety oversight was involved to allow the tour in order to prevent another accident,"" Transport Minister Tetsuo Saito, who visited the area Sunday, told reporters. Following an intensive search involving six patrol boats, several aircraft and divers that went through the night, rescuers on early Sunday found four people near the tip of Shiretoko Peninsula and later six more in the same area, about 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) north from where the boat sent a distress call. Some of them were plucked from the sea, while others were washed onto the rocky coast. An orange-colored, square-shaped lifesaving float with the boat’s name on it was also found near the rocks, the coast guard said. Footage on public broadcaster NHK showed one of the victims arriving on a helicopter and being transferred to an ambulance on a stretcher. Rescuers held up blue plastic shields to protect the victim's privacy. The sightseeing vessel made an emergency call early Saturday afternoon, saying its bow had flooded and that it was beginning to sink and tilt, the coast guard said. Contact with the boat had since been lost. The coast guard said the operator told them that everyone on the boat was wearing a life vest, but some of the victims found were without them. Average April sea temperatures in Shiretoko National Park are just above freezing, which experts say would cause hypothermia. “It’s a very severe condition especially when they are wet,” Jun Abe, vice chairman of the Society of Water Rescue and Survival Research, told TBS TV. Yoshihiko Yamada, a Tokai University marine science professor, said the boat was likely to have run aground after it was tossed around in high waves and damaged. A boat of that size usually does not carry a life boat, he said. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida cut short his attendance at a two-day summit in Kumamoto in southern Japan and returned to Tokyo. He told reporters early Sunday that he instructed officials “to do everything they can for the rescue.” The cause of the accident is under investigation, but officials and experts suspect a safety negligence. High waves and strong winds were forecast when the boat left and Japanese media reports said fishing boats had returned to port before noon Saturday because of the bad weather. A tour boat crew belonging to another operator told NHK that he warned the Kazu 1 crew of rough seas and told them not to go. He also said the same boat ran aground last year and suffered a crack on its bow. Saturday’s tour was reportedly the first by the operator this season, and the accident just before Japan’s Golden Week holidays starting late April could dampen local tourism, which slumped during the pandemic. Japan is still largely closed to foreign visitors. Hokkaido Gov. Naomichi Suzuki told reporters Sunday that he planned to request safety checks by tour operators in the prefecture ahead of the holidays. According to the operator’s website, the tour takes around three hours and offers scenic views of the western coast of the peninsula and a chance to see whales, dolphins and brown bears. The national park is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site and is famous as the southernmost region to see drifting sea ice.",World/Associated Press,10 found dead after Japan tour boat with 26 aboard sinks,https://news.yahoo.com/4-people-missing-tour-boat-225108580.html

4/26/2022,"Racially motivated violence looks like the mass shootings that killed Xiaojie Tan, Daoyou Feng, Chung Park, Hyun Grant and Suncha Kim in Atlanta on March 16, 2021. Racially motivated violence also looks like suicide, which is defined as a deliberate act of self-directed violence in order to cause injury to oneself that results in death. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. When broken down by race, suicide is the first leading cause of death among Asian American young adults age 15-24. This is true of no other racial group in this age range in America. Despite this disparity, very little attention is paid by society and by gatekeeping institutions like academe and private and public funding agencies as to what causes suicidal behavior among racial minorities like Asian Americans. There is not enough research on how to prevent suicide among Asian Americans in particular. What makes this research more challenging to do is that Asian Americans are also the least likely racial group to seek and utilize mental health services. I am a doctoral candidate studying public health, with a focus on minority mental health disparities research. Here’s what I think is important to know about how violence, suicide and disparities all connect to affect Asian American lives. When an Asian American death occurs by suicide, it is not simply because that person experienced risk factors. Sure, the evidence suggests that the risk of a suicide attempt increases if there are easily accessible means such as guns in the home or if the person knows someone who died by suicide. But is that the full picture for Asian Americans, or even for other racial minorities? The truth is, the people who study suicide are still trying to come up with a profile of who is “at risk” in order to precisely predict, and ultimately prevent, suicidal behavior and death. Today, many research dollars go into the development of computer algorithms and genetic biomarkers to precisely calculate who is at risk. Will these methods do justice to the racialized experience of being Asian American in the U.S.? So the question now becomes: How can research scientists better understand and develop suicide prevention efforts that precisely address racial minorities like Asian Americans? To answer this question, there must first be research on Asian Americans to study. Unfortunately, the first, only and last study that assesses national epidemiological prevalence estimates of mental disorders in the Asian American community occurred and was published in the early 2000s, nearly two decades ago. Since these data were collected, the U.S. Asian population grew 72% by 2015, making Asians the fastest-growing racial or ethnic group, surpassing Hispanics. In my view, suicide among Asian Americans is a seriously unaddressed problem that could become endemic in a rapidly growing community with little to no direction on how to stop it. What if there was a way to scientifically account for racism as the fundamental cause of health disparities? The answer lies in understanding stigma. Stigmatized identity is arguably a universal phenomenon. People who are stigmatized are unwanted by society, negatively stereotyped, rejected and excluded, and ultimately othered. Asian Americans have experienced this kind of stigmatization institutionally since the early years of modern America as racial categorizations began to solidify. As America continues to racialize Asian Americans, it continues a legacy of structural violence and historical trauma. This means that anti-Asian violence exists within the very fabric of American society. It is this societal oppression and violence that becomes internalized into self-hatred, self-harm and ultimately the self-directed violence that is suicide. When it comes to being Asian in America, though, the story is incomplete with looking only at race. There are plenty of violently oppressive systems that Asian Americans face that pile on the risk of self-directed violence. These are intersecting in nature. It is the intersectionality, or cross-sections, of Asian American identity that must be closely investigated to uncover insights into suicide prevention for this incredibly diverse community. Being an immigrant and experiencing xenophobia, for example, is a dominant experience for many Asian Americans. Although many have lived in the United States for several generations, Asian Americans do account for a large portion of today’s adult second generation. Second-generation immigrants are people who are native-born citizens in the United States and have at least one parent who is foreign-born. What makes this important to know? Current trends indicate that the U.S. is explosively growing into an immigrant-rich nation. More than 36% of all Americans are projected to be of immigrant origin – that’s first- or second-generation – by 2050. By that time, the overwhelming majority – 93% – of the country’s working-age population will be of immigrant origin, too. Here’s the problem: Second-generation immigrants are considered an at-risk group for suicidal behavior and death by researchers across the world. Researchers aren’t fully sure why yet, and that’s why this research is so timely. Research takes decades to implement. It also takes decades to figure out the problem and how to address it. The public health scientists who work on disparities research are aware of the complex problems facing minority populations like Asian Americans. If there were an intervention to end racism and xenophobia, perhaps many Asian American lives would be saved both from homicide and suicide. The reality is that white supremacy runs so deep in America that even reversing racism would not undo the disparities in health outcomes such as suicide. This is because assimilation is “traumagenic.” That means the traumatic exposures of racist and xenophobic violence and discrimination hold the power to disrupt psychological and physiological functioning and alter genetic code for generations to come. Race-based traumatic stress holds the power to predispose entire populations, entire communities like Asian Americans, to self-directed violence. In my view, what is left to do is to work to change the norms of inclusion. It won’t take years of research to do that. Just start now. Act locally. Here’s a first step.

4/26/2022,"On April 14, retired Missouri teacher Nedra Jeffress, of Independence, wrote a letter to state Rep. Chuck Basye, the Rocheport Republican who is pushing hardest to ban transgender girls from school sports. “I’m wondering if there is data supporting the need for bills regulating this in Missouri or if this (is) a solution in search of a problem,” Jeffress wrote. “As an educator who has worked at the middle school and high school level in Missouri, I know how hard it is for transgender students to be accepted by peers, parents, churches and some teachers. If they are able to participate on an athletic team, they may find acceptance important to their well-being. I hope you would sponsor bills that support positive mental health for each citizen of the state of Missouri instead of proposing bills that attack a population already at risk. Thank you for your time,” she said in closing. The next morning, she received this far less respectful reply: “Nedra, Do your own research. I don’t care about your feelings nor do I care about your resume. “Bottom line, my intent is to keep women’s/girl’s sports for the female gender. “If a person was born with a penis, that individual doesn’t belong in sports designed solely for females. “Now go ahead and have your meltdown and/or temper tantrum. Remember, Let’s Go Brandon!!” Was this a parody, or a prank? Even with vitriol in politics and in everyday life increasingly not just tolerated but rewarded, would any elected official answer so rudely? We emailed Basye, asking if he had really responded this way to a constituent, and if so, why. He wrote right back to say that he had written the message, only taking issue with our characterization of Jeffress as a constituent: “This individual is not a constituent according to our management database. The statement speaks for itself.” Whether she lives and votes in his district isn’t the point, of course, and that she can’t vote either for or against him doesn’t make his incivility any more acceptable. Jeffress, who taught in Independence for 29 years, and now works part-time as a middle school graduation coach, said she’d waited a full week before sending us what he’d written to her, because she did not want to contribute to our current divisions. But after thinking about it, she decided that she did want to “stand up” by making his comments public, because “that’s what’s wrong with politics, the personal attacks.” She has written to other officials with whom she disagreed, she said, including Sen. Roy Blunt and then-Gov. Eric Greitens, “but this is the only time I’ve ever received a response like this.” In the race to lower the bar on what passes for defensible behavior, yesterday’s lapses are today’s fundraising opportunities.

4/26/2022,"Watch: U.S. visits Kyiv and steps up military aid for Ukraine STORY: In a visit designed to show Western support, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskiy and other top officials in Kyiv late on Sunday (April 24), after a train journey from Poland. U.S. officials said the cabinet secretaries pledged new assistance worth $713 million for Zelenskiy's government and other countries in the region that are fearful of further Russian aggression.The meeting between the U.S. delegation and Ukraine's leaders ran for three hours, or more than double the allotted time, a U.S. official said.Before the visit by Blinken and Austin, Ukrainian officials drew up a list of weapons urgently needed from the United States, such as anti-missile systems, anti-aircraft systems, armored vehicles and tanks, Zelenskiy aide Igor Zhovkva told NBC News on Sunday.The high level U.S. visit highlighted the shift in the conflict since Ukrainian forces, armed with a massive influx of weapons from the West, fought off a Russian assault on the capital Kyiv. By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON (Reuters) -Russia told the United States to stop sending more arms to Ukraine, warning that large Western deliveries of weapons were inflaming the conflict and would lead to more losses, Moscow's ambassador to Washington said. Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands of people, displaced millions more and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States - by far the world's two biggest nuclear powers. The United States has ruled out sending its own or NATO forces to Ukraine but Washington and its European allies have supplied weapons to Kyiv such as drones, Howitzer heavy artillery, anti-aircraft Stinger and anti-tank Javelin missiles. Anatoly Antonov, Russia's ambassador to the United States, said such arms deliveries were aimed at weakening Russia but that they were escalating the conflict in Ukraine while undermining efforts to reach some sort of peace agreement. ""What the Americans are doing is pouring oil on the flames,"" Antonov told the Rossiya 24 TV channel. ""I see only an attempt to raise the stakes, to aggravate the situation, to see more losses."" Antonov, who has served as ambassador to Washington since 2017, said an official diplomatic note had been sent to Washington expressing Russia's concerns. No reply had been given, Antonov said. Watch: Russia renews attack on Mariupol, Ukraine says STORY: Russia on Saturday resumed its assault on the last Ukrainian defenders holed up in a giant steel plant in Mariupol... days after Moscow declared victory in the southern city and said its forces did not need to take the plant.Ukraine’s Azov Battalion - a nationalist militia prominent in the defense of Mariupol - released a video Saturday, it said, showed women and children sheltering in the complex.UNIDENTIFIED BOY: ""(I hope) we can leave here and see the sun, because we've been sat here for two months already.""Reuters could not independently verify where or when the video was shot.The attack on Mariupol, the biggest battle of the conflict, has raged for weeks as Russia seeks to capture a city seen as vital to its attempts to link the eastern Donbas region with Crimea, which Moscow seized in 2014. Ukraine’s army was not ready to try break through the siege of the port city by force, according to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. But - he told reporters at an evening news conference that Kyiv had every right to do so. Zelenskiy also said that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin would visit Kyiv on Sunday, and that he planned to discuss the types of heavy weapons Ukraine needs to battle the Russian invasion. ""We will talk about the weapons we need and about the time framework for deliveries. I would like to reiterate that during the last week, I believe that during the last week the signals, the messages, the steps, the timings, the quantities, I am talking about weapons from the United States, all this has improved.""In the city of Odesa, video from Saturday showed residents being rescued by firefighters as smoke billowed from a building. According to the Ukrainian armed forces, two missiles struck a military facility and residential buildings in the city… and Zelenskiy said at least eight people died. The death toll could not be independently verified. The Russian defense ministry said it used high-precision missiles on Saturday to destroy a logistics terminal in Odesa where a large number of weapons supplied by the U.S. and European nations were being stored.  It also said Russian forces had killed up to 200 Ukrainian troops. ""We stressed the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice,"" Antonov said. The interview was replayed on Russian state television throughout Monday. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin visited Kyiv on Sunday. They told Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskiy of more than $322 million in new military financing for Ukraine, taking total U.S. security assistance since the invasion to about $3.7 billion, a U.S. official said. U.S. President Joe Biden pledged $800 million in more weaponry for Ukraine on Thursday and said he would ask Congress for more money to help bolster support for the Ukrainian military. President Vladimir Putin says the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia and Moscow had to defend against the persecution of Russian-speaking people. Putin, who says Ukraine and Russia are essentially one people, casts the war as an inevitable confrontation with the United States, which he accuses of threatening Russia by meddling in its backyard and enlarging the NATO military alliance. Ukraine says it is fighting an imperial-style land grab and that Putin's claims of genocide are nonsense. Zelenskiy has been pleading with U.S. and European leaders to supply Kyiv with heavier arms and equipment. Putin warned in February that there would be no winners in a conflict between NATO and Russia, which has the world's biggest arsenal of nuclear warheads.

""Many other foreign officials were trapped visiting Moscow and played around just to show the supremacy of Russian diplomacy and how great they are and how they dictate the world how to behave,"" he said. Guterres ""should focus primarily on one issue: evacuation of Mariupol,"" Kuleba said, referring to the the besieged city where an estimated 100,000 people are trapped while a contingent of Ukrainian fighters hold out against Russian forces in a steel mill where hundreds of civilians also are taking shelter.

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: Poland and the United Kingdom maintain a wide-ranging and important defence partnership and this move will benefit both countries, as well as the wider NATO alliance. This missile is at the forefront of threat detection and deterrence, with Poland’s Short-Range Air Defence system seeing even greater alignment between our Armed Forces. Flying at supersonic speeds, CAMM missiles can destroy modern air threats including stealth aircraft and high-speed missiles. Each CAMM family missile is equipped with an advanced active radar seeker that can see even the smallest, fastest and stealthiest targets through the worst weather and the heaviest electronic jamming. They are capable of hitting a tennis ball-sized object travelling at several times the speed of sound. President Vladimir Putin said today that Russia's economy was stabilising after being hit by unprecedented sanctions over the military campaign in Ukraine. ""The Russian economy continues to stabilise. Inflation has slowed down, the weekly rate of price growth has approached normal levels and prices for some goods have already begun to decline,"" Putin said during a televised government meeting. He added that it was due to two factors: the ruble ""actively strengthening"" and the ""dynamics of consumer demand"". ""After a spike in February-March, there is an objective decline in consumer activity,"" Putin said. Since Moscow moved troops into Ukraine on February 24, Russia has been hit with a barrage of international sanctions, including embargoes on key exports, accelerating already high inflation. While Putin has said Russia's economy weathered the sanctions well, economists believe that the worst economic impact is still to come. Greenpeace activists in Norway blocked a Russian oil tanker from unloading its cargo near Oslo for several hours Monday, saying the shipment was helping to finance Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""warfare"". The Hong Kong-registered Ust Luga, leased by Russian oil company Novatek, was carrying 95,000 tonnes of fuel bound for Esso's terminal in southeast Norway, Greenpeace said in a statement. The tanker was coming from its namesake Russian city, near Saint Petersburg, according to the Marine Traffic website. Greenpeace activists in a small boat chained themselves to the ship, while others in kayaks unfurled banners reading ""oil fuels war,"" the group said. Some activists were stopped by police before they could take part in the action. After several hours, police removed 20 activists who had chained themselves to the ship, police said in a statement. Ukraine's military command said on Monday that Russia was trying to bomb Ukraine's rail infrastructure in order to disrupt arms supplies from foreign countries. ""They are trying to destroy the supply routes of military-technical assistance from partner states. To do this, they focus strikes on railway junctions,"" the armed forces command wrote in a post on Facebook. ( Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, told the House of Commons that ""all of Europe can now see the true face of President Putin and his inner circle"". He added: ""His intention is only to destroy, to crush, to rub out the free peoples of Ukraine. He does not want to preserve. He must not be allowed to prevail. Ukrainians are fighting for their very lives and they are fighting for our freedoms. ""The President of Ukraine himself said as much. If Russia stops fighting there will be peace. If Ukraine stops fighting there will be no more Ukraine. "" Honoured to represent 🇺🇦 at the 21st session of @UN4Indigenous to spread the truth about gross human rights violations in occupied #Crimea by #Russian occupiers and the barbaric #Russia's invasion of #Ukraine.I will call on International community to step up pressure on Russia. pic.twitter.com/PMMcjj3quz — Emine Dzheppar (@EmineDzheppar) April 25, 2022 A woman from the Ukrainian city of Odesa says she had a lucky escape from a Russian missile attack at a hair salon as a tinfoil cap shielded her from serious injuries, writes Nataliya Vasilyeva. Until last weekend, the Black Sea port of Odesa had been spared the intense airstrikes and shelling that the country’s south was witnessing when the city came after the first major Russian airstrike since the war started two months ago. One of the Russian missiles that hit Odesa on Saturday landed near a hair salon. One unnamed customer filmed herself walking out of the salon, with a hair cutting cape and hair foils on. “Hello, Russian worlds, let me show you what kind of Nazis you’re fighting,” she said as she showed a bleeding wound on her hand to the camera. “We, girls, decided to fix ourselves up a bit at the hairdresser’s - and a missile fell right on our hairdresser’s. Thank you, Russian world!” In another video recorded later that day, the hair salon customer joked about how she used to wonder what chances were she could get “hit by a missile.” “One in a million,” the blonde woman with a patch on her right shoulder said. “Well, this day has come. I was saved by circumstances.” The woman said she sat with the tinfoil cap on during her colouring as she heard a whistling sound before the missile hit the building. Vladimir Putin should leave all occupied territory in Ukraine including Crimea for true peace to be achieved, the Defence Secretary has suggested, as he said it is up to Ukraine what a resolution to the war would look like. Commons Defence Select Committee chairman Tobias Ellwood asked: ""What does success in Ukraine look like? Are we doing enough to prevent Ukraine from losing but not enough to make sure that they win? What is our strategy? ""Is it to push Russia back from the pre-February lines or indeed liberate the entire Donbas region? If it is in Europe's wider security interest to see Putin humiliated in Ukraine then the entire mainland must be liberated, that must be our strategic end."" Ben Wallace replied: ""Our strategic aim is twofold. One is that Putin must fail in Ukraine, he must fail in his invasion and I think he is on course to do that actually. He must fail in his occupation of Ukraine and I think he has definitely failed in achieving that. ""To the fine tuning of that, that is as much a matter of Ukraine's choice as it is of anybody else - that Ukraine gets to choose where it wishes to settle for peace. We will do everything we can to support them. ""For my part, I want Putin not only beyond the pre-February boundaries. He invaded Crimea illegally, he invaded Donetsk illegally and he should comply with international law and in the long run leave Ukraine."" The UK risks falling behind its military allies' commitments to Nato if it does not ""reboot"" defence spending, Labour has warned. John Healey, Shadow defence secretary, told the Commons: ""I say to the Secretary of State he has given us a paragraph in his statement today on Nato. Our leadership in Nato could be at risk as Britain falls behind allies in responding to this Ukraine invasion. More than a dozen European countries are now rebooting security plans and defence spending but the UK has not yet done either. ""Can I urge him therefore to revisit the integrated review, review defence spending, reform military procurement and rethink his Army cuts? Because we will be dealing with the consequences of Putin's war for many years to come."" Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, agreed that Nato needs ""a long-term plan"", adding: ""We need to know what will Nato look like and how will western Europe or Europe including many of its new members contain Putin after all this has passed. ""Because we have a man who has clearly been involved in an illegal invasion of a country, war crimes against the Ukrainian people, and how are we going to live with that neighbour in Europe should he still remain? And that is an important consideration for all of us."" Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, said Stormer armoured vehicles will give Ukrainian forces ""enhanced, short-range anti-air capabilities both day and night"". Mr Wallace told the Commons that ""as we can see from Ukrainians' requests, more still needs to be done"". He added: ""So, for that reason I can now announce to the House that we shall be gifting a small number of armoured vehicles fitted with launchers for those anti-air missiles. ""The Stormer vehicles will give Ukrainian forces enhanced, short-range anti-air capabilities both day and night."" Ben Wallace reiterated Russia has so far ""failed in nearly every one of its objectives"", adding: ""In recognition of this failure the Russian high command has regrouped, reinforced and changed focus to securing Donetsk and Luhansk oblast."" He added in the Commons: ""At the start of this conflict Russia had committed over 120 battalion tactical groups, approximately 65% of its entire ground combat strength. ""As of now we assess around over 25% of these have been rendered not combat effective. ""Ukraine is an inspiration to us all. Their brave people have never stopped fighting for their lands. They have endured indiscriminate bombardment, war crimes and overwhelming military aggression but they have stood firm, galvanised the international community and beaten back the army of Russia in the north and the north east. ""We anticipate this next phase of the invasion will be an attempt by Russia to occupy further the Donbas and connect via Mariupol the Crimea so it's urgent that we in the international community ensure Ukraine gets the aid and weapons it so much needs."" Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, is giving a statement to the House of Commons. He told MPs: ""It is our assessment that approximately 15,000 Russian personnel have been killed during their offensive. ""Alongside the death toll are the equipment losses and in total a number of sources suggest that to date over 2,000 armoured vehicles have been destroyed or captured. ""This includes at least 530 tanks, 530 armoured personnel carriers and 560 infantry fighting vehicles. ""Russia has also lost over 60 helicopters and fighter jets. ""The offensive that was supposed to take a maximum of a week has now taken weeks."" The United States believes Kyiv can win the war against Russia if it has the ""right equipment"", Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin said today, as strikes on railway infrastructure in the central Ukraine killed at least five. A landmark visit by Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Ukraine came as the war entered its third month, with thousands killed and millions displaced by the fighting. ""The first step in winning is believing that you can win. And so they believe that we can win,"" Austin told a group of journalists after he and Blinken met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. ""We believe that we can win, they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support."" The meeting between the two sides lasted three hours and was ""very productive and detailed"", according to a Pentagon spokesman, adding that Zelensky was also briefed on a security summit in Germany on Tuesday among Western allies. Russia's first deputy permanent representative to the United Nations said Moscow sees no point in establishing a ceasefire in Ukraine at this stage, fearing Kyiv may use it to stage ""provocations"", RIA reported. RIA cited Dmitry Polyanskiy as saying that Russia had not struck any residential areas in Ukraine's Black Sea port city of Odesa. Ukraine's southern air command on Saturday said that two missiles struck a military facility and two residential buildings in Odesa. The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor will join an EU investigations team to probe possible international crimes committed in Ukraine, the EU's judicial cooperation agency has said. It will be the first time the Hague-based ICC - set up in 2002 as an independent tribunal to probe the world's worst crimes - will take part in a joint investigation with other countries. ""The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague will become a participant in the joint investigation team (JIT) on alleged core international crimes committed in Ukraine,"" Eurojust said in a statement. Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor, has signed an agreement with prosecutors general of Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine to take part in a joint investigative team to look into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity committed since Russia's invasion on February 24. The agreement ""aims to facilitate investigations and prosecutions in the concerned states as well as those that could be taken forward before the ICC,"" Eurojust said. At least five people were killed and another 18 injured on Monday in Russian strikes on railway infrastructure in the central Ukraine region of Vinnytsia, Kyiv said. ""Preliminary information shows that five people died and 18 were injured. Rescue operations are under way, investigators, prosecutors and other services are working at the scene,"" the office of the Ukrainian prosecutor general said in a statement on social media. Moscow said it was expelling 40 German diplomats in response to the ""unfriendly decision"" by Berlin to kick out Russian diplomats over the conflict in Ukraine. Russia's foreign ministry said in a statement it summoned Germany's ambassador in Moscow and handed him a note ""declaring persona non grata forty employees of German diplomatic institutions in Russia as part of a symmetrical response"". ""A strong protest was made to the head of the German diplomatic mission in Moscow in connection with the openly unfriendly decision of the German government,"" to expel Russian diplomats, the ministry said. Earlier in April, Germany said it was expelling a ""significant number"" of Russian diplomats, amid similar moves by other European states, over Ukraine. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the decision was in response to the ""unbelievable brutality"" of Russian forces in its pro-Western neighbour Ukraine. Ukraine's State Security Service (SBU) has denied having any plans to kill Russian television host Vladimir Solovyev. It issued the denial after Russian President Vladimir Putin said the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB, the Federal Security Service, had prevented a murder attempt by a ""terrorist group"" on a journalist later named by state media as Solovyev. ""The SBU has no plans to assassinate V. Solovyev,"" the SBU said in a statement published on the Telegram messaging app. More than 800 Ukrainian refugees have been waiting since March to come to the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, according to would-be sponsors. British hosts frustrated by delays have compiled a spreadsheet detailing how many refugees are waiting since the sponsorship scheme opened on March 18. It shows that visa applications for at least 622 Ukrainians, sponsored by 310 UK hosts, are still outstanding after being made during the first week. A further 261 refugees, sponsored by 130 Britons, are waiting for a decision on applications made during the second week of the scheme. And 128 Ukrainians who applied under the scheme, sponsored by 43 hosts, after April 1 are still waiting. Antony Blinken, the US Secretary of State, said this morning following a trip to Kyiv yesterday that he believes ""a sovereign, independent Ukraine will be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin is on the scene"". Downing Street was asked if the UK agreed with Mr Blinken. The Prime Minister's Official Spokesman said the UK is not seeking regime change in Russia but insisted ""democratically elected governments will always endure"". The spokesman said: “We are not focused on anything to do with regime change in Russia. We are focused on changing Putin’s course of action in Ukraine. “But nonetheless I think it is always clear democratically elected governments will always endure over the alternative.” Boris Johnson announced on Friday last week that the UK intended to reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv this week. No 10 has now said it is hoping the embassy will be ""up and running by next week"". The Prime Minister’s Official Spokesman said: “We announced last week we are in the process of reopening the embassy. That work is taking place in earnest this week with the aim of having it up and running by next week.” The Government has announced plans to roll out further import bans and tariff increases on Russian goods, taking the total value of goods targeted to more than £1bn. The new sanctions. will include import bans on silver, wood products and high-end products from Russia including caviar. Tariffs will also be increased by 35 percentage points on around £130m worth of products from Russia and Belarus, including diamonds and rubber. International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said: The UK continues to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine and is working closely with our international partners to inflict maximum damage to Putin’s regime, reducing the resources and funds he needs to carry out this illegal war. We are taking every opportunity we can to ratchet the pressure to isolate the Russian economy and these further measures will tighten the screws, shutting down lucrative avenues of funding for Putin’s war machine. Over the coming weeks, the UK will ban additional Russian goods from reaching UK shores and will also be imposing tariffs on additional products.Read more: https://t.co/U0EY9LWnnq pic.twitter.com/1QePxagCir — HM Treasury (@hmtreasury) April 25, 2022 Explosions have rocked a Russian fuel depot and logistics hub near the Ukrainian border, in a reported missile strike. Emergency services said the large fire began at around 2am Moscow time (11pm GMT) at the Transneft Bryansk-Druzhba facility in Bryansk, owned by the oil pipeline company Transneft. No injuries have been reported and the cause has not yet been established. The depot is being used to shore up Vladimir Putin's forces, prompting the Russians to launch an investigation. Bryansk is a strategic administrative centre 154 km (96 miles) northeast of the Ukrainian border, and Russian officials said last week that Ukrainian helicopters had hit residential buildings and injured seven people in the area. Footage on social media appeared to show at least two blasts lighting up the city's skyline, one at a military unit's fuel tank and the other at an oil refinery, with huge plumes of smoke and reports of evacuations. Rob Lee, from King's College London's war studies department, said the targets were within range of a Tochka-U tactical ballistic missile if deployed close to the Russia-Ukraine border. Ukrainian officials have not commented. Ukraine has denied reaching an agreement with Russia on evacuating civilians from a steel plant in Mariupol, the final pocket of resistance in the besieged southern city. Russia had said earlier on Monday that it would open a humanitarian corridor for civilians to leave the huge Azovstal plant where they are holed up with Ukrainian fighters and have come under heavy fire. ""Today, the Russian side once again announced the existence of a corridor for civilians to leave Azovstal. This could be believed if the Russians had not destroyed humanitarian corridors many times before,"" Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk wrote on the Telegram messaging app. ""It is important to understand that a humanitarian corridor opens by the agreement of both sides. A corridor announced unilaterally does not provide security, and therefore is not a humanitarian corridor."" She said Ukraine had ""appealed to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to be the initiator and guarantor of the humanitarian corridor from Azovstal for civilians."" President Joe Biden has nominated career foreign service officer Bridget Brink to be the next US ambassador to Ukraine, the White House announced on Monday. Brink, currently the US ambassador to Slovakia, speaks Russian and will fill a position that has been officially empty since 2019. She has ""spent her twenty-five-year career in the Foreign Service focused on advancing US policy in Europe and Eurasia,"" the White House said in a statement. The seasoned diplomat has also served as deputy chief of mission in US embassies in Uzbekistan and Georgia, and was stationed early in her career in Belgrade, Serbia and in Cyprus. Moscow said Monday it had arrested members of a ""neo-Nazi terrorist"" group in Russia who allegedly planned to assassinate pro-Kremlin TV anchor Vladimir Solovyov on orders from Ukraine. ""The Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation detained a group of members of the neo-Nazi terrorist organisation National Socialism/White Power, which is banned in Russia,"" Russia's FSB security agency said in a statement carried by news agencies, adding that those arrested are Russian citizens. The FSB claimed the group was planning the ""murder"" of Russian TV and radio journalist Solovyov ""on the instructions of the Security Service of Ukraine"". According to the FSB, ""fake"" Ukrainian passports, arms, drugs and an improvised explosive device were found during a search of the detainees' homes. The claims come after separate allegations last month that pro-Kremlin mercenaries were planning assassination attempts on Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky, leaving his family ""terrified"". Russian president Vladimir Putin has claimed the Kremlin's main spy agency foiled what he described as a Western plot to kill a prominent Russian journalist. ""This morning, the Federal Security Service stopped the activities of a terrorist group that planned to attack and kill one famous Russian TV journalist,"" Putin told prosecutors. ""They have moved to terror - to preparing the murder of our journalists,"" Putin said. He did not immediately provide evidence to support his claims and they have not been independently verified. The Interfax news agency said that members of a nationalist group had been detained by Russian authorities. It claimed the group, acting on the orders of Ukrainian spies, was plotting to kill Russian journalist Vladimir Solovyev. Boris Johnson said it was ""very important"" to have a French president ""who can be relied upon"" on international issues such as the war in Ukraine. Emmanuel Macron defeated right-wing rival Marine Le Pen - who has previously had close ties to Vladimir Putin - to secure a second term in office. Mr Johnson told reporters this lunchtime: ""I think it's very important that we have in Paris, a president of the French Republic who can be relied upon when it comes to some of the most important international issues, and particularly when you look at what's been going on in Ukraine."" He added: ""We share a very common, very similar perspective and the unity of the West, the unity of Nato, has been absolutely vital for the stance we've taken against Putin, and that will now continue and I'm very, very reassured by that."" Russia's flagship carrier Aeroflot on Monday reported a 20 percent fall in passenger traffic in March year-on-year following tough Western sanctions over Moscow's military operation in Ukraine. Passenger traffic on international and domestic flights fell to 2.2 million in March, the first full month after the conflict began, from 2.77 million last year, the airline said Passenger traffic on international flights declined by half, it said in a statement. The Russian state owns a 57.3 stake in the group. A senior Italian politician faces calls to resign after sending a tweet featuring a capital Z, in apparent coded support of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Nick Squires writes from Rome. The letter Z, a marking used by some Russian tanks, armoured vehicles and trucks, has come to represent the brutal two-month-old Russian assault on its neighbour. Critics said that Vito Petrocelli’s position as head of the commission on foreign affairs for the senate, the upper house of parliament, was no longer tenable. Mr Petrocelli wrote a tweet ostensibly wishing Italians a happy Liberation Day – April 25 is celebrated for the Allied liberation of Italy and the defeat of Italian Fascist and German Nazi forces. But he chose to write the word “liberazione” or liberation as LiberaZione, with a capital Z. Mr Petrocelli is a member of the Five Star Movement, the populist party which has had a strong pro-Moscow stance. Giuseppe Conte, the head of Five Star and a former prime minister, called the tweet “shameful”. Russia sees no risks in Moldova's breakaway region of Transdniestria, and wants a peaceful settlement of the situation there, Interfax news agency reported on Monday citing Russian deputy foreign minister Andrei Rudenko. Rustam Minnekayev, deputy commander of Russia's central military district, was earlier quoted by Russian state news agencies as saying full control over southern Ukraine would give it access to Transdniestria, a breakaway Russian-occupied part of Moldova in the west. This prompted Moldova to summon the Russian ambassador to express ""deep concern"" over the comments. Russia intends to discuss issues related to the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol and its besieged Azovstal steel plant in talks with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, its foreign ministry said on Monday. Thousands of Ukrainian civilians and defiant troops are in the encircled plant and multiple attempts at humanitarian corridors have collapsed. Russia said a ceasefire would allow evacuations on Monday, but its success remains to be seen. The UN chief is due to visit Moscow this week, prompting Prime Minister Boris Johnson to warn that the Russian president Vladimir Putin would ""manipulate"" the trip for his benefit. Guterres will meet Putin and then head to Ukraine for talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky. The German government will make a decision on the delivery of 100 old Marder infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine ""soon,"" said a German government spokesman on Monday. German defence company Rheinmetall has requested approval to export the vehicles to Ukraine, a defence source told Reuters on Monday, in what would be the first heavy weapons shipment from Germany to the country. Russia's defence ministry on Monday announced a ceasefire around the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol to allow a civilian evacuation from the industrial area that has been sheltering the port city's remaining defenders. Russian troops ""from 14:00 Moscow time (1100 GMT) on April 25, 2022, will unilaterally stop any hostilities, withdraw units to a safe distance and ensure the withdrawal"" of civilians, the defence ministry said in a statement. It follows multiple pleas from the Ukrainian president and the UN over the weekend to cease fighting in the area, where an estimated 1,000 civilians are located along with about 2,000 Ukrainian fighters. The destroyed city's last Ukrainian defenders have already rejected Vladimir Putin's call for them to surrender, instead warning Moscow that peace talks would be called off if any of them were killed. Russia has claimed victory in the city, however the steel plant has remained a stubborn pocket of resistance. The city is crucial to the Kremlin's new aim of occupying the south of the country and establishing a land route to Crimea. Russia has warned the United States against sending more arms to Ukraine, Moscow's ambassador to Washington told Russian state television. ""We stressed the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice,"" Anatoly Antonov said in an interview with the Rossiya 24 TV channel. Antonov said an official diplomatic note had been sent to Washington expressing Russia's concerns. He said such arms supplies from the US would further aggravate the situation and raised the stakes of the conflict. It comes hours after Washington's top diplomat met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv, pledging new assistance worth $713 million (£560m) for him and allies fearing Russian aggression. Dramatic videos show the moment large fires erupted early on Monday morning at an oil storage facility in the Russian city of Bryansk, used as a logistics base for Moscow's forces. Russian officials said the blaze broke out at a facility owned by oil pipeline company Transneft at 2am Moscow time (11pm GMT), and there had been no need to evacuate any parts of the city of 400,000 people. Russia's investigative committee said in a separate statement that its head, Alexander Bastrykin, has ordered a probe into the incident. Ukrainian officials have so far made no comment on the fire and its possible cause. Unconfirmed reports on social media suggested a missile strike may have hit the facilities. No injuries have been reported. Footage online appeared to show a second large fire had broken out in the city.

Scroll down in this blog for latest and breaking news. Blinken says US diplomats will return to Ukraine 'this week': the US Secretary of State expressed solidarity with Volodymyr Zelensky and announced the gradual return of US diplomats to Ukraine. Zelensky says the Easter holiday doesn't bring any joy: ""The great holiday today gives us great hope and unwavering faith that light will overcome darkness, good will overcome evil, life will overcome death, and therefore Ukraine will surely win,"" Mr Zelensky said from Kyiv's ancient St Sophia Cathedral. Ukraine proposes talks with Russia next to Mariupol steel plant: Russian forces launched fresh airstrikes on a Mariupol steel plant where an estimated 1,000 civilians are sheltering along with about 2,000 Ukrainian fighters. UN chief warned that Putin will 'manipulate' Russia visit: Boris Johnson has warned that Vladimir Putin will try to ""manipulate"" a visit by Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary-General, to Moscow. Russia has made 'minor advances': Russia has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the Donbas, the UK's Ministry of Defence said on Monday. More on each of these here. Russia struck Ukraine's Kremenchuk oil refinery with long-range missiles and hit military installations in its former Soviet neighbour, the Russian defence ministry reported this morning. The ministry said it hit Ukrainian military installations and the Kremenchuk oil refinery near the Dnipro River, which the governor of the Poltava region had said was destroyed earlier this month. ""High-precision long-range weapons destroyed fuel production facilities at an oil refinery on the northern outskirts of the city of Kremenchuk, as well as petroleum products storage facilities which fuelled military equipment for Ukrainian troops,"" the ministry said, though this has not been independently verified. It comes as a Russian oil depot in Bryansk, near the Ukraine border and used as a logistical hub for troops, was ablaze overnight. The cause has not yet been determined. Russian soldiers wrote “Christ is risen” on missiles fired into Ukraine over the Orthodox Easter weekend as Vladimir Putin spoke about “neighbourly love” at a Moscow cathedral service. At least a dozen people died in the Russian missile attacks exactly two months after Russian forces launched their invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin has used the Russian Orthodox Church in its propaganda machine. Over the weekend, Russian forces described missiles as “Easter eggs” being sent to Ukraine. ""The tankmen wrote 'Christ is risen' on their missiles,"" a Russian soldier told a chuckling woman in a phone recording released by Ukraine's SBU. ""So we are having some fun in any way we can."" More details on this here The US wants Russia ""weakened"" so it cannot invade again and Ukraine can win the war if it has the right equipment, Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin said Monday on returning from a trip to Kyiv. ""The first step in winning is believing that you can win. And so they believe that we can win,"" Austin told a group of journalists after the visit with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The pair met Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, were the first high-profile US officials to visit Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on February 24. ""We believe that we can win, they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support,"" Austin said. ""We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can't do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine."" Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated French President Emmanuel Macron on his re-election and defeat of far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, the Kremlin said Monday, as tensions remain over the Ukraine conflict. ""I sincerely wish you success in your state activities, as well as good health and well-being,"" Putin said in a telegram to Macron, according to a statement from the Kremlin. Mr Macron has liaised with Putin several times during the two months of conflict and attempted - unsuccessfully - to mediate between the sides at several points. It was a visit mired in secrecy and only confirmed by the White House after it had taken place, but Washington's top diplomat Antony Blinken and defence secretary Lloyd Austin agreed several measures while meeting Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv at the weekend. US officials said the cabinet secretaries pledged new assistance worth $713 million (£560m) for Mr Zelensky's government and 15 allied, Nato and partner countries in the region that are fearful of further Russian aggression. This includes more than $300 million (£235m) in foreign military financing for Kyiv and $165 million (£130m) in sales of non-US made ammunition, compatible with Soviet-era weapons the Ukrainians use. Such financing is different from previous US military assistance for Ukraine. It is not a donation of drawn-down US Defence Department stockpiles, but rather cash that countries can use to purchase supplies. US diplomats will return to Ukraine in the coming weeks, with Washington announcing a new ambassador to the country, Budget Brink, a veteran official. Staff from Kyiv's US Embassy had been relocated to Poland. Ahead of the visit by Blinken and Austin, Ukrainian officials drew up a list of weapons urgently needed from the United States, including anti-missile systems, anti-aircraft systems, armoured vehicles and tanks. It comes as the US and Nato allies have shown growing readiness to supply heavier equipment and more advanced weapons systems. Britain has promised to send military vehicles and is considering supplying British tanks to Poland to free up Warsaw's Russian-designed T-72s for Ukraine. Five railway stations came under fire in western and central Ukraine on Monday, causing an unspecified number of casualties, Ukrainian television quoted state-run Ukrainian Railways as saying. Oleksander Kamyshin, the company's chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour and details were being checked. We'll bring you more details on this when we have it. Russia has made ""minor advances"" in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the Donbas, according to the UK's Ministry of Defence. The ministry said in its latest intelligence briefing that Moscow is still ""yet to achieve a significant breakthrough"" and that its decision to besiege rather than attack Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant has ""exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness"". Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 25 April 2022 Find out more about the UK government's response: https://t.co/7NVrOfB161🇺🇦 #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/OfcnHgGfR3 — Ministry of Defence 🇬🇧 (@DefenceHQ) April 25, 2022 United States diplomats will begin a gradual return to Ukraine this week, Washington's secretary of state and defence chief have announced, in a further signal to Russia that its war is failing. The trip by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin - which the US confirmed only after the two had left Ukrainian territory - came as the invasion enters its third month, with thousands dead and millions displaced. Washington ordered the withdrawal of its diplomats in the weeks prior to Russia's February invasion of Ukraine. ""Starting this week, members of that team will be able to do day trips instead into Ukraine,"" a US official said. ""Ultimately, (they will) resume presence in Kyiv."" Britain and a host of European capitals are also reopening their embassies in Ukraine's capital in the coming days. Russian air defence systems shot down two Ukrainian drones in Russia's Kursk region which borders Ukraine, regional governor Roman Starovoyt wrote on his Telegram channel on Monday. He said there were no casualties. The report could not be immediately verified. After a secrecy-shrouded visit to Kyiv, US Secretary of State Blinken said Russia is failing in its war aims and ""Ukraine is succeeding."" The trip by Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin was the highest-level American visit to the capital since Russia invaded in late February, though Washington refused to confirm any travel plans.

4/26/2022,"A Massachusetts couple won a verdict worth nearly $5 million against a local country club after suffering from the years-long, ""continuous threat"" of wayward golf balls struck by hackers. A Plymouth County Superior Court jury awarded Erik and Athina Tenczar $4.93 million in December, finding that Indian Pond Country Club was at fault for not protecting the couple's home from a constant barrage of bad golfing, court records showed. The Tenczars originally sued both Indian Pond and Spectrum Building Inc., which built their new home in Kingston, about 40 miles south of downtown Boston. They settled with the builders, leaving Indian Pond Country Club as the sole defendant. “The continuous threat of golf ball strikes occurring at any time prevents the Tenczars from the use and enjoyment of their property,” which was purchased for $750,000 on April 27, 2017, according to the complaint. The Tenczars' attorney, Robert Galvin, said he understands skepticism about his clients' dismay over errant golf balls, knowing they were buying property that abuts the 15th hole. But the inconvenience of an occasional backyard golf ball pales in comparison to the 651 dimpled spheres that have struck their property, Galvin said. There have been ""multiple broken windows,"" according to the lawsuit and one particularly jarring shot on July 18, 2018 that ""struck a window in the home shattering the glass and terrifying the plaintiffs' young daughter and resulting in the Tenczars contacting the Kingston Police Department to file a report."" ""They thought they were buying golf-course-view property and what they ended up buying was a golf-course-in-play property,"" Galvin told NBC News on Monday. ""It was apparent to anyone that this house was going to be struck as repeatedly as this one was, they would have never bought this property."" A lawyer for Indian Pond Country Club could not be immediately reached for comment on Monday. The judgement is being appealed with the defense arguing that $4.93 million is excessive, according to Galvin. The couple's home is at the bend of a severe leftward curve in the course. So golfers seeking to ""cut the dogleg"" would regularly blast off the tee in hopes of clearing a tree line — but end up hitting the their home instead, the Tenczars claimed. But now the couple and their three young daughters hope the problem could be solved as the tee box on 15 has been moved back, disincentivizing golfers from their attempted shortcut and instead encouraging more simple shots that follow the dogleg, Galvin said.",U.S./NBC News,Mass. family wins $5 million verdict from country club after property hit by over 600 golf balls,https://news.yahoo.com/mass-family-wins-5-million-195858994.html
4/26/2022,"TOKYO (AP) — Ukraine's government has apologized and removed a photo of Japanese wartime Emperor Hirohito from a video showing him with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini after Japan protested, officials said Monday. Japan will continue to support Ukrainians who are defending their country from Russia's invasion despite the “completely inappropriate” portrayal of Hirohito, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki said. The video, posted by the Ukrainian government on Twitter on April 1, criticized Russia's invasion as “rashism.” Underneath the photos of the three World War II-era leaders were the words “Fascism and Nazism were defeated in 1945.” Japan fought World War II in the name of Hirohito, who was revered as a god until he renounced his divinity after Japan’s defeat. Historical evaluations of his role in the war remain divided. He is known posthumously in Japan as Emperor Showa. “Portraying Hitler, Mussolini and Emperor Showa in the same context is completely inappropriate,” Isozaki told reporters. “It was extremely regrettable.” Isozaki said Japan lodged a protest and demanded the removal of the emperor's image, which Ukraine has done. “Our sincere apologies to Japan for making this mistake,” the Ukrainian government tweeted Sunday. “We had no intention to offend the friendly people of Japan.” Ukraine Ambassador to Japan Sergiy Korsunsky also apologized in a tweet Monday, saying the creator of the video lacked an understanding of history. Hirohito's son, former Emperor Akihito, devoted his reign to atoning for the impact of the war in and outside Japan. The video has been replaced with one without Hirohito's photo, but many Japanese on social media continued to criticize the original as an insult and said Japan should stop supporting Ukraine. Others said Hideki Tojo, the Japanese wartime prime minister who was later convicted of war crimes and hanged, would have been a better choice than Hirohito for the video. Some, however, raised concern that Japan’s demand that the video be revised was censorship and said Ukraine’s concession set a bad precedent that would embolden Japanese conservatives to further rewrite Japan’s wartime history. Japan has worried that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could have an impact in East Asia, where China's military has grown increasingly assertive and has threatened to unite with Chinese-claimed Taiwan by force if necessary. Japan has tried to play a greater role as part of the Group of Seven industrialized nations in response to the invasion, joining a series of sanctions against Moscow and providing support for Ukraine in line with other members. Japan provided $300 million for Ukraine and neighboring countries that have accepted displaced Ukrainians, and has also accepted hundreds of evacuees since Russia's invasion in late February.",World/Associated Press,Ukraine removes Hirohito from video after Japan protests,https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-removes-hirohito-video-japan-102440028.html
4/26/2022,"NV: Several days ago, Russia announced its new war aims: to capture Donbas and southern Ukraine, and establish a land connection to Moldova’s Transnistria region, landlocking Ukraine. How likely are they to succeed in this? Rustamzade: Russia is known for making grand pronouncements that rarely correspond to reality. Its newest war aims are in no way proportional to its capabilities. On March 25, as you will recall, Moscow said it aimed to capture the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. One month later, and there are no major offensives to be seen. I suspect the same will happen with their most recent announced plans. While the Kremlin has certain forces and resources in Donbas, their reserves in the south are not enough to reach Mykolaiv, let alone Odesa and Transnistria. Most likely, it was a purely political claim, in line with their traditional diplomatic modus operandi. The Russian military does not have the capabilities to enact such a plan. NV: What about Zaporizhzhia, where they are also trying to advance? Rustamzade: Under the present circumstances, with all the forces at their disposal, Russia could hope to achieve some limited success in Donbas, capturing one or two medium-sized settlements – at most. We can see that Ukrainian and Russian military forces are at parity levels. Russia still holds an advantage in long-range artillery, but that won’t last. Regarding Zaporizhzhia – I don’t think the Russians will have any success there. The flow of Western arms to Ukraine is huge. The weapons systems that are arriving will significantly increase the firepower of the AFU – howitzers and MLRS. I think that in two weeks Ukraine will suppress the offensive capabilities of the Russian army, and will transition to offensive operations, relentlessly striking at the enemy forces. NV: Meaning that the Armed Forces of Ukraine need to hold out for 10-12 days more? Rustamzade: That’s right, 10-14 days. NV: What do you think about Russian attempts to encircle Ukrainian troops in Donbas? Rustamzade: They (the Russians) were planning two encirclements there. The larger one was supposed to envelop the AFU in the area of Joint Forces Operation, with the smaller one around Severodonetsk. Under the least favorable circumstances for Ukraine, the worst case scenario would be Russians encircling or pincering the AFU near Severodonetsk. But there’s no chance of Moscow pulling off the larger encirclement and achieving a major victory. Read also:  Pentagon chief says Ukraine can win war against Russia ‘if they have the right equipment, support’  The advantage in anti-tank weapons Ukraine enjoys is negated by the superior numbers of Russian long-range artillery. Ukrainian troops destroy any enemy vehicles that get closer that five kilometers. This means that neither side can decisively defeat the other. Force parity has been achieved, albeit an asymmetrical one. NV: Recent weeks we’ve spent awaiting a large-scale battle for Donbas, that is yet to materialize. Is it because Russia changed its tactics, or do they simply lack the numbers? Rustamzade: I no longer pay any attention to their scary posturing. How can 100,000 troops conduct a major offensive? I saw their preparations, how they were gradually deploying their forces. Instead of concentrating them for a single breakthrough, they dispersed their forces along six or seven axes of attack. NV: Is there a military rationale behind this approach? Rustamzade: No. It’s contrary to military thinking. Both in planning, and in executing this operation, I was puzzled by how they went about it militarily. It can be explained by the primacy of political motives over military ones in this war. When the leadership suddenly issues new demands, the army struggles to adapt. It takes a month or two to prepare an operation involving 100,000 troops. Precisely those politically-motivated tactical changes are preventing the Russian military command from properly planning and conducting its operations. NV: Self-propelled artillery is being supplied to Ukraine by our allies. Are these shipments too late? Rustamzade: War is unpredictable. It could be that some event could cause a regiment of the AFU to have logistical problems, or maybe high-ranking officers will be killed. That would enable the Russians to have some tactical success, maybe they’ll manage to capture a town. Anything more significant is unlikely, since Russia doesn’t have an advantage in manpower. Superior Russian firepower is powerless against multi-layered Ukrainian defenses that are designed to withstand artillery fire. NV: UK PM Boris Johnson recently said that the war could last until the end of 2023. Do you agree with this assessment? Read also:  Russia will say it’s fighting NATO to excuse defeat, says military expert  Rustamzade: I assume Johnson was talking about the marginal scenario. Next week, the U.S. House of Representatives is expected to pass the Ukraine Lend-Lease Act, meaning that Ukraine will have access to unlimited quantities of highly-effective weapons. In my assessment, if the AFU manages to continue striking at the Russian forces for a month, Moscow will be left with nothing with which to continue prosecuting the war in Ukraine. What Ukraine’s military and political objectives will be after that – I don’t know. Winning the campaign will not put an end to the overarching Russia-Ukraine conflict. NV: That much is clear. Rustamzade: Perhaps, Johnson meant that the war won’t end after the Ukrainian army pushes the invaders to the de-facto borders of Feb. 24, or even Ukraine’s actual borders circa 2014. The war will become a positional one, with the eventual resolution of the conflict taking much longer. NV: Do you think Putin can prolong the war without declaring a general mobilization? Rustamzade: No. Russia has already committed all of its active units. They could, at great expense, recruit 30,000-50,000 mercenaries from private military companies or some other sources. But it would only prolong the death throes of the Russian army, and won’t give it an upper hand against the Ukrainian military. NV: Could Ukraine cut through the Russian positions in the south, isolating them from Crimea, or is too early for that? Rustamzade: The first thing Ukraine should do after the victory in Donbas is relieve Mariupol, and push the Russians away from Kharkiv, so that people there can be free from constant artillery barrages. Next, AFU can advance towards Kherson and from Zaporizhzhia, cutting Russian formations in half. It will all depend on the tactical situation on the ground. But it’s clear that the priority is Mariupol; it can even be done concurrently with Donbas operations, given favorable circumstances. NV: How would you describe the situation around Mariupol? The city is being heavily bombed. Rustamzade: The fortifications underneath the Azovstal steel mill were built by the Soviets to withstand tactical nukes. The Azov guys are likely unfazed by the Russian bombardment. It’s a vast, fortified underground complex. Sure, they can feel the explosions, but their lives are not in danger. While they had enough supplies and ammo initially, now that they are joined by the marines, border guards, and civilians, their stockpiles are getting stretched thin. Read also:  Military expert Zhdanov on Russia’s 'worse than expected' performance in Donbas  We can’t be sure, without knowing how much food, water, and rounds they have on hand. With supplies, they will hold out for two weeks, a month, a month-and-a-half. There’s no way to clear out the complex without assaulting it, and that’s very difficult to do. NV: How reasonable, do you think, are the suggestions to strike at the Crimea Bridge? Rustamzade: Just as Russia can’t knock out Azovstal, it’s difficult to do so with the Crimea Bridge. Structures like those are made with enemy attacks in mind. According to my military experience, it takes at least 12 Su-24 war planes, armed with 500-1,500-kilogram bombs to take out a regular railway bridge. And this one is much more formidable than that. A precise hit with a 1,500-3,000-kilogram bomb could damage it, but not destroy. It would take bombs like the one Russia is dropping on Azovstal, and Ukraine doesn’t have bombs or missiles like that. AFU can’t even seriously damage the bridge, let alone destroy it. It was built to withstand fire from much more powerful armies than the Ukrainian one. NV: Let’s try and take account of the two months of this war. Rustamzade: As it stands, we’re talking about a strategic Russian defeat. In 60 days, they’ve changed their war aims twice, and didn’t manage to accomplish any of them. Much ink has been spilled over the shortcomings of the Russian forces. I’d like to mention the weak points of Ukraine’s military. As we finally see Western weapons pouring into Ukraine in large quantities, the sluggish reaction of the civilized world is obvious. But I think that some responsibility also lies with the Ukrainian command, who were drawing up lists of requested arms. I kept saying that you were short on artillery, but were asking for jets and tanks. I think that your army waged war well, even wonderfully well, but there’s room for improvement. You should have focused your requests on weapons that could deliver victory on the battlefield, as opposed to asking to “close the skies” – which basically meant “please wage the war for us.” Or asking for tanks: you have around 800 tanks, why do you need 200-300 more? Tanks aren’t effective in modern wars. Instead, you should have been asking for the howitzers since day one. I mean this as positive, constructive criticism. I admire the Ukrainian army for managing to stop the world’s second military. But it’s prudent to try and draw conclusions from one’s own missteps. NV: Does Russia have enough missiles to keep bombing our cities? Rustamzade: It’s difficult to say, but they are clearly using them sparingly. The missile strike on Odesa is tragic, but we should realize that the Russians aren’t trying to hit civilian targets, their aim sucks. Their missile systems are crooked and inaccurate. They have nothing to gain from killing a baby as the world watches. They could have launched a light, cheap naval missile at Odesa. Instead, they tried to hit a military target with an air-launched cruise missiles, and missed. These missiles are Soviet-made, how could they possibly be precise? They prioritized accuracy, since these missiles were supposed to bear nuclear warheads. That’s how I see it, I’m certain they were aiming at a military target. Read also:  Russia hiding scale its losses in Ukraine from its population, UK Defense Ministry says  NV: So, you think they are counting their missiles now? Rustamzade: Of course. Recall the first days of the war – the intensity of Russian missile strikes has decreased dramatically. It means they’re trying to conserve their stockpiles. Another piece of good news – they don’t have parts to make new ones. Their Kalibr missiles were made with foreign components. Their air-launched cruise missiles were fully domestically-sourced, but the production was halted a long time ago. X101 missiles are built with modern parts, of which they have none. Similarly, Russia doesn’t have components for Iskander missiles. This lack of parts, lack of productive capacity to make the missiles is a boon for Ukraine.

4/26/2022,"The FDA warned consumers against supplement sellers with variations of the name ""Artri"" and ""Ortiga."" These Mexico-based sellers contain dangerous, unlisted ingredients that can cause ulcers and high blood pressure. Supplement sales have skyrocketed during the pandemic, leading expert to call for more FDA oversight. The US Food and Drug Administration is cracking down on supplements sold by two Mexico-based vendors. The FDA released a consumer warning on April 20 that said supplements with variations of the name ""Artri"" or ""Ortiga"" contain dangerous hidden active ingredients not listed on the product label. The supplements are marketed as treatments for symptoms of arthritis, muscle pain, osteoporosis, and bone cancer, per the FDA. The agency's laboratory analyses revealed certain Artri and Ortiga products contain, but do not list, potentially dangerous ingredients including: Declofenac. An FDA laboratory analysis from January found Artri Ajo King contains declofenac as an unlisted ingredient. A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) similar to ibuprofen and aspirin, it can lead to serious gastrointestinal problems, like ulceration and perforation, if taken incorrectly. Diclofenac sodium. The FDA found Ortiga products also typically contain diclofenac, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular events like stroke and heart attack, and may lead to ulceration or fatal perforation of the stomach and intestines. Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid that has been used to treat severely ill COVID-19 patients on ventilators. It can change blood pressure, cause infections, and damage bones. Methocarbamol, a muscle relaxant used to treat pain or injury that can cause sedation and dizziness. Both Artri and Ortiga are manufactured in Mexico and are labeled primarily in Spanish, per the FDA and eBay. Supplement sales have skyrocketed since 2020, part of the wellness industry's continued growth. Scientists and medical experts have called for greater FDA oversight into over-the-counter dietary supplements, as the agency does not approve pills prior to sale the way it regulates prescription medicine. Harvard Medical School and independent product testing company NSF International identified four unapproved, unlisted stimulants in six supplements marketed for weight loss and fitness in 2017. A 2017 study in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine found the amount of melatonin in 71% of supplements is off by a 10-percent margin, meaning the majority of sellers mislabel how much of the hormone is in the pill. The study also found the amount of melatonin within pills in a single jar can vary by a whopping 465%. US poison control centers have received 275,000 reports of people who reacted badly to supplements over the past two decades, Insider's Erin Brodwin previously reported.
