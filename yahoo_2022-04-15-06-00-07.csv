4/15/2022,"By David Morgan and Doina Chiacu WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Republican National Committee voted unanimously on Thursday to withdraw from the Commission on Presidential Debates, saying the group that has run the debates for decades was biased and refused to enact reforms. ""We are going to find newer, better debate platforms to ensure that future nominees are not forced to go through the biased CPD in order to make their case to the American people,"" the committee's chairperson, Ronna McDaniel, said in a statement. The RNC's action requires Republican candidates to agree in writing to appear only in primary and general election debates sanctioned by the committee. The nonprofit commission, founded in 1987 to codify the debates as a permanent part of presidential elections, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It was unclear what format future RNC-backed debates would take or whether they would take place as often as in recent decades. The move, which followed months of wrangling between the RNC and the commission, will potentially deprive voters of seeing Republican and Democratic candidates on the same stage. Millions of Americans usually watch the presidential debates, and many viewers say they help them make up their minds about whom to vote for, according to research by the Pew Research Center. The Democratic National Committee, the RNC's counterpart for President Joe Biden's party, accused Republicans of trying to hide from voters. ""Voters can count on hearing from President Biden and Vice President (Kamala) Harris, who are proud of their records,"" DNC chairperson Jaime Harrison said in a statement. The RNC's decision follows grievances aired by former President Donald Trump and other Republicans about the timing of debates, debate formats and the selection of moderators. Defenders of the debates say they are an important element of the democratic process, but critics say they have become television spectacles in which viewers learn little about the candidates' policies. Trump refused to participate in what was supposed to be the second of three debates with Biden in 2020, after the commission switched it to a virtual contest following Trump's COVID-19 infection. The RNC said the commission ""refused to enact simple and commonsense reforms.""

4/15/2022,"A fiery crash in Minnesota was caught on camera earlier this week. A driver lost control of a car while entering the highway and slammed into a box truck. The truck then careened across the road, into the rails of an overpass and burst into flames ― with some of the burning pieces falling onto the road below. “I figured if I went over the bridge that would have been the end of it,” truck driver Mitchell Moore told local ABC station KSTP. But the railing held and kept the truck from going over. The incident was captured by the state’s highway cameras: Dramatic video captures the moment a car lost control on a highway, slamming into a truck and sending it into the side of a highway overpass where it was engulfed by flames.

The truck driver safely escaped from the burning vehicle. https://t.co/WEDFlV9OJRpic.twitter.com/lKow940jPS — ABC News (@ABC) April 14, 2022 The footage shows the truck’s cab engulfed in flames and burning to practically nothing in a matter of minutes. Amazingly, no one was seriously injured. Police have not released the identity of the car’s driver, but told local NBC station KARE11 that the person “showed suspected signs of impairment” and is “being processed for driving while impaired.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.",U.S./HuffPost,Out-Of-Control Car Slams Into Truck In One Of The Wildest Wrecks You'll Ever See,https://news.yahoo.com/control-car-slams-truck-one-092638484.html
