3/13/2022,"Feminist-led protesters have set off 1,000 rape alarms and hurled them at Charing Cross police station to mark the one-year anniversary of the Clapham Common vigil for Sarah Everard which was broken up by police. They were joined by Patsy Stevenson, whose arrest while being restrained face down by officers became the defining image of the vigil one year ago. Standing outside the police station in London’s West End, she said: “One year ago today, the police waited until sunset to brutalise us at Clapham Common. Today, we waited until sunset to detonate 1,000 rape alarms at Charing Cross station. “Fuck the police.” Hundreds of rape alarms set off outside Charing Cross police station by @SistersUncut led protesters pic.twitter.com/sKFUtzF02j Charing Cross was at the centre of a misogyny and racism controversy last month when a report by the police watchdog revealed details of officers sharing messages about hitting and raping women, as well as the deaths of black babies and the Holocaust. Amid the deafening shriek of hundreds of rape alarms, which littered the ground outside the police station, protesters chanted: “A-C-A-B: All cops are bastards.” Olga Smith, a member of Sisters Uncut, said: “When we found out about Sarah’s disappearance at the hands of a serving cop, we asked the police, how will you keep us safe? And the police said: stay home. Stay hidden. Carry a rape alarm. “When we refused to hide away, when we gathered in grief and anger at Clapham Common to mourn our sister, Sarah Everard, the police brutalised us. “Today we say: police are the perpetrators. Police don’t keep us safe. That is why have thrown our rape alarms back at the perpetrators in the infamous Charing Cross police station.” This week, two judges ruled that the Met police breached the rights of the organisers of the planned vigil for Sarah Everard, the Reclaim These Streets group, who did not attend the vigil itself. The backlash against officers’ behaviour at the vigil became a catalyst for the “kill the bill” movement, which has seen thousands of people protest against the introduction of expanded policing powers – particularly relating to protest – in the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill. Protesters had gathered outside New Scotland Yard, on the Victoria Embankment, at 4.30pm, where they heard speeches from activists before a short march, led by activists carrying green and purple flares, past Trafalgar Square to Charing Cross police station. “A year after Sarah Everard was murdered by them, a year after women and allies at the vigil were arrested and beaten by them .. big up to everyone who is here today because this struggle is made by you.”@SistersUncut hype the crowd gathered outside the Met police HQ pic.twitter.com/ZQ6dp0UVjw Cassie Robinson, a 36-year-old from London who attended the protest, said: “I was there last year on Clapham Common, and the police’s behaviour was disgraceful. I’ve completely lost faith in the police to take violence against women seriously, and I participated in today’s protest because I am withdrawing my consent for violent men to have any authority in this society.” Wayne Couzens, a serving Met police officer in an elite firearms unit, was convicted in September of the kidnap, rape and murder of Everard, who disappeared while walking home through the Clapham Park area of south London. It emerged that he had used his warrant card and additional powers given to police during the coronavirus pandemic to trick Everard into his car. On Friday, two judges ruled that the Met police breached the rights of the organisers of a planned vigil for Everard. The group had to cancel the event after the force said it would be illegal to stage a rally under lockdown restrictions. However, hundreds of people attended the unofficial gathering on Clapham Common.",News/World news,"Feminist protesters set off 1,000 rape alarms outside London police station",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/12/feminist-protesters-set-off-1000-alarms-outside-london-police-station
3/13/2022,"A majority of voters still want to see Boris Johnson resign despite the crisis over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer. There has been a significant fall in the proportion of voters who want the prime minister to stand aside. However, the new poll showed that 53% still wanted to see him go – down 10 points since January. On the Ukraine crisis, a majority (52%) think the government has not gone far enough on accepting Ukrainian refugees into the UK. When asked whether they would take in Ukrainian refugees themselves, 9% of people said that they would, while a further 20% said they would consider it. About 63% said they were not in a position to do so, while 8% said they were, but wouldn’t. Fourth-fifths (78%) of the UK support sending arms to Ukraine. Similarly, almost seven in 10 (68%) support donating western fighter planes for the Ukrainian air force to use in the country’s defence. Voters are divided over a potential no-fly zone over Ukraine, with 40% saying they support western air forces enforcing a no-fly zone, and the shooting down of Russian aircraft that breach this, but 39% disagreeing. There are clear concerns over the cost of living at home. There was a 15-point increase in those who now expect the economy to get worse over the next year (71%), while 57% expect their personal finances to worsen – up 12 points. Johnson’s net approval ratings have improved from low levels. Those approving of the job he is doing make up 27%, with 54% disapproving. That gives him a net approval rating of -27, a 6-point improvement on the last poll a fortnight ago. Keir Starmer’s ratings remain largely unchanged, giving him a net approval rating of -2. Overall, Labour’s lead has fallen marginally to 2 points over the Tories. Starmer’s party has 37% support, with the Tories on 35%. When people were asked who they preferred as prime minister, “none of these” remained the clear leader. However, when forced to choose, people would still prefer a Labour government led by Starmer (44%) over a Conservative government led by Johnson (35%). Joe Curran, senior research executive at Opinium, said: “While most European countries are granting fleeing Ukrainians visa-free refuge, the UK has so far opted to require visas, to much outrage from certain quarters. Our polling finds that over half (52%) of the British public think that the government hasn’t gone far enough in accepting refugees. “As for Boris Johnson, a cynic would say that the crisis in Ukraine offers both a distraction from domestic controversies and also the opportunity to act the statesman. Indeed we have seen a small uptick in his approval ratings, although we can’t say for certain that this is related to the war in the east. Whether this trend continues depends on many factors including the deepening cost of living crisis.” Opinium polled 2,007 people online between 9 and 11 March.",News/Politics,More than half of UK voters still think Boris Johnson should resign,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/12/more-than-half-of-uk-voters-still-think-boris-johnson-should-resign
3/13/2022,"Philippe Coutinho has played 598 minutes for Aston Villa, in which time he has scored four goals and set up three more. Victory at Leeds on Thursday meant Villa have won three league games in a row for the first time since the beginning of last season. There is a real sense of momentum there now and it is not just about results. Coutinho, quite aside from his direct contribution, is a player of stature, the sort of figure whose very presence can persuade fans, even other players, that a club is going places. Which inevitably prompts the question: what is he doing at Villa? It’s probably largely an economic question. As the rest of European football retrenches because of the economic impact of the pandemic, the Premier League’s relentless expansion goes on. The English middle class can afford players who are out of range to all but a tiny handful abroad. But it’s also a question rooted in modern ideas of what an attack-minded player should be. To create is no longer enough and Coutinho is not a natural presser. His gift is inconsistent; already at Villa he has had one stinker, in the win over Everton. Football is haunted by these castaways left behind by the economics of the modern game: too expensive for all but the absolute elite to own, but too unreliable for the absolute elite to play. In his second autobiography, published in 2015 after his move to MLS, Steven Gerrard told Liverpool to “treasure Philippe”, saying he could become “Liverpool’s main man and a top player in world football”. But in the last game Gerrard had played with Coutinho, Liverpool lost 6-1 at Stoke. Coutinho’s is a career dotted with major disappointments: Liverpool’s 3-1 defeat to Sevilla, Barcelona’s 4-0 defeat at Anfield, Brazil’s 2-1 defeat to Belgium … Two months after Gerrard’s autobiography was released, Jürgen Klopp replaced Brendan Rodgers as Liverpool manager. There was a thought Coutinho wasn’t a natural Klopp player but he seemed to adapt well enough. A year after Klopp’s arrival, though, Barcelona made him a target, with the Catalan newspaper Sport announcing “Objetivo Coutinho”. Immediately he became not just a footballer but also a pawn in a wider game of super-club power relations and also therefore less than a footballer, somebody else’s prize. For Coutinho, nothing has been quite the same since. He signed a new contract in January 2017, another example of Liverpool’s smart recent transfer dealings; if they were going to lose him, they were going to ensure they secured an enormous fee. That arrived the following January, thanks to Barcelona’s desperation to spend the money they had received for Neymar. Humiliated by losing one Brazilian star, they needed another; Coutinho’s form had wavered as he suffered a back injury but Liverpool were able to negotiate the fee up to €120m with a potential further €40m in add-ons. That largely funded the signings of Virgil van Dijk and Allison; Liverpool, in the end, were the biggest beneficiaries of Paris Saint-Germain’s record purchase of Neymar. Coutinho never settled at Barcelona. His debut, in a Copa del Rey tie against Espanyol, showed all his skill, was capped by a nutmeg and celebrated by a fanbase eager for a new hero, but for all the will that he should succeed, it soon became apparent he was neither the new Neymar nor the new Andrés Iniesta. He was simply not what Barça needed. An ageing midfield was already struggling to cover for an increasingly indulgent forward line. The structure was breaking down. His regains per game, a crude guide to how well a player is pressing, halved to 0.9 in his first full season there. The defining games of that season were the two legs of the Champions League semi-final, against Liverpool. He was taken off after an hour of each and jeered on both occasions: by Barcelona fans who had come to see him as an emblem of the club’s problems and by Liverpool fans revelling in the fact a player who had deserted them was on the receiving end of a historic comeback. This, Coutinho must have reflected, was the home he could have had, rather than becoming this wandering ghost. He was loaned to Bayern, showed flickers of his best – a hat-trick against Werder Bremen, a brilliant performance against Paderborn, two symbolic late goals in the 8-2 win over Barcelona – but once the high-pressing Hansi Flick had replaced Niko Kovac as coach, Bayern were never going to sign him permanently. So it was back to Barcelona, where he found himself behind the 18-year-old Pedri in the pecking order, then suffered a knee injury that required surgery. He is 29 and should be at the peak of his powers, but he fits nowhere. He has the ability and salary of a super-club player but he is not famous enough for the celebrity clubs and doesn’t press well enough for the philosophy sides. As the pandemic hit finances across Europe, nobody could afford him. Once he would have been characterised as a luxury player, but who can afford luxuries these days? Barça ended up desperate to offload his €20m-a-year salary so they could register Ferran Torres while complying with La Liga’s salary cap. Coutinho, desperate to get back into the Brazil squad before the World Cup, reportedly accepted a 35% pay cut. Whether Villa needed another creator is debatable but Gerrard clearly still rates him and he is the sort of player who makes football fun – which, for an aspiring mid-table side, is a not insignificant attribute. But fun, as Everton found with James Rodríguez, can be unreliable. Coutinho’s regains are now at 1.0 per game, 70% less than was managed in his final season at Villa by Jack Grealish, the player for whom he would seem a spiritual replacement. Coutinho could not be accommodated at Barça or Bayern but perhaps at Villa the team can be built for him, accentuating his ability and compensating for his flaws. Perhaps this is the level in the modern game for a player of his characteristics. Perhaps finally, after four years of drift, he has found a home. Perhaps.",Sport/Football,Magical misfit Philippe Coutinho may have found unlikely home at Aston Villa | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/12/magical-misfit-philippe-coutinho-may-have-found-unlikely-home-at-aston-villa
3/13/2022,"The Cristiano Ronaldo header that gave him a hat-trick, his 807th career goal, and claimed this pivotal game in the late-season shootout for Champions League qualification oozed quality and desire. Nine minutes remained when the 37-year-old bulldozed Matt Doherty aside, eyes fixed only on Alex Telles’s corner from the right, and connected his forehead to the ball as he cartwheeled through the air before hitting the turf. From here ecstasy and the ringing out of “Viva Ronaldo” from home fans who could not quite believe their hero had done, again, what he just loves to do: wrest the story his way. All of this before the watching Tom Brady, the seven-times record Super Bowl winner, Ronaldo’s hat-trick taking him past Josef Bican’s all-time count for the highest number ever. United’s potential XI was the centre of intrigue: would Bruno Fernandes’s illness exclude him? Yes. Would Marcus Rashford, who is considering his future, return? Yes. Had David de Gea tested positive for Covid? Yes. Except, it was a false result and a second lateral flow plus a PCR cleared him to play. In Fernandes United lost a fifth of their 45 league goals, in the returning Ronaldo a fifth was restored. Spurs had done a job on Manchester City last month via rapier breaks yet here they would mix it up via passages of keep-ball, as when Sergio Reguilón, Rodrigo Bentancur, Harry Kane, and Son Heung-min exchanged passes between them. Rashford’s demeanour has recently been flat but there was sparkle in the way he threaded Paul Pogba in behind, though Ronaldo could not finish the Frenchman’s pass. Next the effervescent Jadon Sancho drifted onto Harry Maguire’s chip, found Ronaldo, who let fly: the ball hit Eric Dier’s hand in the area but the referee, Jonathan Moss, was not interested. Now, though, the Portuguese caused all inside the stadium to sit up. Raphaël Varane tapped to Fred who backheeled a flick to the No 7: with Dier backing off the centre-forward struck the sweetest of 25-yard finishes past Hugo Lloris, who seemed to struggle for spring, and United were ahead. Cue delirium from the Old Trafford faithful and their side becoming a red blur in the following exchanges, Ronaldo dropping off the front to link with Diogo Dalot, and the shaven-bald Pogba forcing a save from Lloris. United do this, though. Dominate and seem to convince they are far superior then fall away. The point was underlined when Ben Davies beat De Gea and Antonio Conte celebrated before it was ruled offside. Could United assert true control, then, or would Spurs find a way to burgle their host as they did City? The answer seemed yes to the latter when a Son corner was headed goalward before Dalot cleared. And, when the impressive Bentancur pickpocketed Pogba near the visitors’ area, prodded to Kane, and a quick counter was launched. This conveyed how unstable United remained and they were to concede when those in white flooded their territory in a more patient approach, Pierre-Emile Højbjerg stepping up from his defensive-midfield role to add numbers. Nemanja Matic felled Kane and when Dier’s free-kick hit the wall Dejan Kulusevski collected, beat Sancho, and crossed: the ball hit Telles and unlike his Dier decision, Moss pointed to the spot. Kane made no mistake, beating De Gea to the latter’s right, yet United had the perfect riposte three minutes later. Matic dropped a ball over the top, Sancho rolled a cross in from the left, and a delighted Ronaldo restored the lead. United are the kings of the second-half collapse so here was another test. When Davies flung himself at a header, Son hoped to race in behind, and Bentancur slide-tackled Pogba, Spurs signalled Conte had surely told them all about their hosts’ softness following the interval. A sweeping move that took in Ronaldo, Sancho and Rashford took United upfield did, though, allow them to keep Spurs where they would want: at arm’s length and forcing a Davies intervention to stop Rashford taking aim with a point-blank header. There was a flow to the contest that made it entertaining fare. At any moment either team might score, as when Kulusevski squared to Son and he missed from yards out. Conte’s men were disappointed but the way Højbjerg, Bentancur, Kulusevski and Cristian Romero squeezed United’s midfield – Pogba in particular – gave them a genuine chance of another equaliser. And so it proved. Here, Kane held off Varane an the ball went left to Reguilón who crossed and a hapless Harry Maguire stabbed in for an own-goal that sent the travelling support into party mode. But, the captain was saved by Ronaldo and when the Portuguese was replaced soon after his game-winning bullet-header his reception was rapturous.",Sport/Football,Ronaldo hits hat-trick as Manchester United edge Tottenham in thriller,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/12/manchester-united-tottenham-premier-league-match-report
