1/10/2022,"Shrewsbury Town had their moment, a lead at Anfield that lasted all of seven minutes, but an inexperienced Liverpool team found a mature response. Jürgen Klopp’s side ultimately thwarted any fleeting hopes Steve Cotterill had of an upset as young Kaide Gordon and the not-so-young Fabinho plus Roberto Firmino eased the Premier League hosts into round four.  Klopp was free to lead Liverpool again having been in isolation with Covid since before the draw at Chelsea. The Liverpool manager rejoined the group at their hotel on the morning of the game and with positive tests continuing to effect the squad, along with injuries and the Africa Cup of Nations, was required to improvise with his team selection. Four teenagers – the full debutant Max Woltman, Kaide Gordon, Conor Bradley and Tyler Morton – started in a side that included the experience of Virgil van Dijk, Andy Robertson and Fabinho. That insurance policy was seriously examined in the first half by Shrewsbury’s disciplined and supremely well-organised game plan. Liverpool unsurprisingly dominated possession against the League One side but toiled to find a way through a five-man visiting rearguard protected by a compact three-man midfield. Gordon forced Shrewsbury goalkeeper Marko Marosi into a low save from the edge of the area and van Dijk headed over from a Robertson free-kick. Otherwise, it was laboured performance, and flat tie, until Cotterill’s side stunned Anfield by taking the lead from their first attempt on Caoimhin Kelleher’s goal. Nathanael Ogbeta, Shrewsbury’s left wing-back, served notice of the threat he posed a minute before the breakthrough when skirting around Bradley and sweeping an inviting cross through the Liverpool area. No team-mate was on hand to capitalise on that occasion. Seconds later, having controlled a cross-field ball from Ethan Ebanks-Landell expertly on his chest, Ogbeta again attacked Bradley before curling another delightful cross behind Ibrahima Konate. This time Daniel Udoh was alert to the wing-back’s intentions and, arriving unmarked in the six-yard box, steered the ball beyond Kelleher to the wild delight of a 6000-strong away crowd. Klopp looked stunned at the ease with which Shrewsbury sliced through his team. They responded sharply, however, and quickly drew level with a goal made in their academy. Morton and Elijah Dixon-Bonner combined to release Bradley in space on the right. The Northern Ireland international picked out Gordon inside a crowded penalty area and the gifted forward’s quick feet enabled him to open up space for a cool finish beyond Marosi. At 17 years and 96 days, Gordon overtook Michael Owen to become the second youngest goalscorer in Liverpool’s history behind Ben Woodburn. The hosts overturned the deficit to lead at half-time through a Fabinho penalty. Given how well their team had defended for 44 minutes, it was a galling way for Shrewsbury to concede. Ebanks-Landell had van Dijk on his back as the pair challenged for Robertson’s free-kick inside the area but no convincing reason to meet the ball with a raised arm. Referee David Coote immediately pointed to the spot and Fabinho sent Marosi the wrong way from it. Shrewsbury maintained their shape and strategy throughout the second half but a lack of composure in front of goal cost them several opportunities to capitalise on the counter-attack. The clearest threat arrived consistently from Liverpool. Marosi denied Dixon-Bonner at close range moments after the restart but was beaten for a third time by a cheeky finish from substitute Roberto Firmino. Bradley claimed his second assist of the contest when he hooked the ball back from the by-line for Konate. The defender’s attempted shot was deflected on to Firmino via a Shrewsbury boot and, facing away from goal, the Brazilian back-heeled past the exposed Shrewsbury keeper. Fabinho claimed his second of the game, and Liverpool’s fourth, with an emphatic finish into the roof of the net from Kostas Tsimikas’ injury-time free-kick.",Sport/Football,Liverpool survive early scare to cruise to FA Cup win over Shrewsbury,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/09/liverpool-shrewsbury-fa-cup-match-report
1/10/2022,"The reaction of Harry Winks said it all. The Tottenham midfielder had bent a free kick from wide on the left towards the far post, more in the hope that a teammate could touch it home, only for it drift over the Morecambe goalkeeper, Trevor Carson, and fly in. Winks looked to the heavens in relief and was barely able to muster a smile. It was the 74th minute and he and Spurs knew that they would be spared an FA Cup upset.  Antonio Conte had heavily rotated his team, offering opportunities to a string of fringe players, and he watched them labour, particularly during a dismal first-half performance when Morecambe deserved to lead through their captain, Anthony O’Connor, who was excellent. Conte could be disappointed with his understudies, particularly Tanguy Ndombele, Dele Alli and Bryan Gil, all of whom he took off in the 69th minute. Only then did Spurs break Morecambe’s resistance. Ndombele was jeered as he left the field. On came Harry Kane, Lucas Moura and Oliver Skipp and, finally, Spurs got the job done. It was a terrible lapse by Ryan McLaughlin that allowed Lucas to steal the ball, streak clear and finish – the Morecambe defender was distraught – while Kane got Spurs’ third towards the very end. Morecambe’s priority is to remain in League One, following their promotion last season, and it has come to feel edgy as they sit 21st out of 24th. But this was an opportunity for their fans to embrace a little escapism, to travel in numbers. It was only their third FA Cup tie against Premier League opposition and they had not been allowed to attend Stamford Bridge last season for the 4-0 defeat against Chelsea because of Covid. They lost 3-0 at Ipswich in 2001. Conte’s changes were playing to impress him and show that they have a future under him at the club – and it has to be said that is debatable. Joe Rodon was also poor, although to single him out in a defence that lacked assurance would be unfair. It had been plain from the eighth minute, when O’Connor thundered through Gil and got away without a yellow card, that the visitors would not want for commitment or organisation in their 5-3-2 system. McLaughlin had wobbled for the first time in the first minute, miscontrolling to allow Ndombele in – he would be closed down – and, from the corner, Ben Davies flashed a header just over. But Spurs lacked tempo and incision during the first half, their passing sloppy and predictable. Morecambe grew in belief, measuring their progress in tackles, blocks, a nutmeg on Gil and flickers in the final third. They could tell there was nothing to be frightened about. It was no surprise when Morecambe went ahead. Rodon had left a backpass a little short in the 12th minute only for Pierluigi Gollini to get out and clear ahead of Cole Stockton. Now Rodon waited for the goalkeeper as he tried to deal with a long ball ahead of Stockton and, when Gollini did not come, he was forced to concede the corner. Alfie McCalmont, the Leeds loanee, took it and O’Connor ran around Japhet Tanganga into a large seam of space in front of goal to sidefoot home on the volley. Spurs needed the interval to reset because they had offered next to nothing as an attacking force. Matt Doherty hit the outside of the post from an impossible angle following a corner and Giovani Lo Celso had a shot blocked after a good run by Ryan Sessegnon, but that was about it. Conte started in the 3-5-2 system that many fans want to see although, with Kane on the bench and Son Heung-min injured, it shone a light on one of the imbalances in the squad that the manager played not one but two false nines – Alli and Gil. Kane, Lucas and Skipp went out to warm up just after half-time and the thought was not whether Conte would need them but when. Apart from Winks, who was busy in front of the defence, Spurs lacked spark. Alli worked Carson with a clever flick from a corner, Sessegnon dragged wide when he should have done better and Lo Celso saw a shot blocked by O’Connor. Who else? Conte had seen enough and his call for the cavalry was marked by the home crowd turning on Ndombele as he sauntered off at low speed. Spurs belatedly had a bit of conviction, even if the equaliser was a soft one from a Morecambe perspective. At that point, the shock felt off. It became more about when Spurs could find the winner as they took up residence in the Morecambe half. Kane blew an easy header and Lo Celso was denied by Carson before Lucas punished McLauglin and Kane put some gloss on the scoreline after another substitute, Emerson Royal, had robbed Greg Leigh.",Sport/Football,Lucas Moura and Harry Kane help Tottenham to avoid Morecambe upset,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/09/tottenham-morecambe-fa-cup-match-report
1/10/2022,"After sailing a little too close to the wind during their 3-2 victory over Crystal Palace, West Ham happily accepted an afternoon free of drama. Manuel Lanzini gave them the lead at the end of a drab first half and David Moyes’s side cruised from there, comfortably keeping Leeds United at arm’s length and sealing their place in the fourth round of the FA Cup thanks to a professional and mature display.  For Moyes, satisfaction came from seeing his side keep a first clean sheet since 12 December. Leeds kept plugging away in the second half, Jack Harrison and Dan James both spurning chances to force extra time, but West Ham rarely looked uneasy. Declan Rice was typically outstanding in central midfield, Lanzini coolly scored his third goal in his last two games and Michail Antonio was a barnstorming presence in attack, racing clear during stoppage time to set up Jarrod Bowen’s clincher. The absence of eight regulars made Leeds vulnerable. West Ham picked their strongest available side and were soon pressing for an opening. There were dangerous efforts from Antonio and Bowen, who saw a shot hacked off the line by Luke Ayling during the early stages, and there was never any prospect of Leeds picking holes in West Ham’s back four during the opening period. With Tyler Roberts, Patrick Bamford, Joe Gelhardt and Rodrigo missing in attack, Marcelo Bielsa had named Raphinha on the bench and handed a first start to the teenage forward, Sam Greenwood. There was also a debut in midfield for Lewis Bate, a 19-year-old signed from Chelsea last summer, and there was little to worry the hosts before the interval. For all their neat approach play, there was little bite from Leeds. Shackled by Issa Diop and Craig Dawson, Greenwood was restricted to a harmless blast from long range before being replaced. Bate also tried his luck, curling a tame effort straight at Alphonse Areola from the edge of the area, but otherwise there was little sign of any zest from Leeds and it was not a surprise when West Ham took the lead in the 34th minute. The frustration for Bielsa is that it was a poor goal to concede. West Ham had rather spluttered as an attacking force at first, Lanzini’s passing radar slightly off, Antonio forced to play with his back to goal too much. But there was also a sense that everything would come together in the final third sooner rather than later. So it proved when Antonio finally seized upon a chance to turn and run down the left flank after another timid Leeds attack had broken down. Claret and blue shirts stormed forward in support and Antonio had time to check back inside before jabbing a pass towards Nikola Vlasic, who shielded the ball from Leo Hjelde before using his upper body strength to roll away from the Leeds centre-back and advance on Illan Meslier’s goal. It was naive defending from Hjelde, who was making his debut alongside Diego Llorente. The 18-year-old was rolled too easily by Vlasic, who was keen to make an impression with Saïd Benrahma away at the Africa Cup of Nations, and he went close to conceding a penalty as he tried to slow the Croatian’s momentum. As it was, Hjelde’s challenge on Vlasic merely led to a mess, Bowen and Meslier both going for the loose ball before Junior Firpo’s desperate lunge gave Lanzini the opportunity to sweep into the empty net. The goal survived a lengthy VAR check for offside against Bowen and West Ham should have extended their lead before the break. Antonio blasted wide from Ben Johnson’s low cross and Ryan Fredericks finished diffidently after a lovely one-two with Bowen, who was a thorn in Firpo’s side. Aware that something had to change, Bielsa replaced Bate and Greenwood with Raphinha and Stuart Dallas at half-time. Yet West Ham were still in charge. Antonio remained a menace, rumbling away from Llorente and sending Bowen through to test Meslier, and it felt like there were possibilities every time Vlasic picked up possession on the left. Leeds, who had moved James up front, struggled to create anything. Adam Forshaw came on for Ayling after an hour, but Bielsa’s problems increased when Firpo went down injured and had to make way for Cody Drameh. With time running out, Bielsa’s mood hardly improved when Harrison wasted a chance to equalise with 15 minutes left, somehow turning Mateusz Klich’s cross wide from close range. Leeds were toothless. James missed another inviting opening and the contest was over when Antonio, charging clear on the break, released Bowen to slide a cool finish past Meslier.",Sport/Football,Manuel Lanzini and Jarrod Bowen easily carry West Ham past youthful Leeds,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/09/west-ham-leeds-fa-cup-match-report
1/10/2022,"A manifesto pledge to hire 26,000 extra health professionals to work in GP surgeries is set to be broken by the government, health leaders have warned, leaving family doctors straining under a heavier workload. About 9,500 of the promised physiotherapists, pharmacists, mental health therapists and other clinical staff so far have been recruited to help GPs and practice nurses.  Senior doctors have warned that patients will pay the price for the slow delivery of extra personnel by facing persistently long waits for an appointment. In one of a raft of NHS pledges in the Conservatives’ 2019 general election manifesto, Boris Johnson promised to employ 6,000 more primary care professionals by 2024 to work in GP practices in England. This was on top of the 20,000 that NHS England had already promised in its Additional Roles Reimbursement Scheme (ARRS). The plan was to free up family doctors’ time by having physiotherapists seepatients with sore backs, pharmacists undertaking medication reviews, counsellors supporting people with mental health problems and dieticians advising those with food-related problems. Those 26,000 staff, alongside the arrival of “6,000 more doctors in general practice” in a separate pledge would help GPs and their teams offer 50m more consultations, the Conservatives said. But in November the health secretary, Sajid Javid, admitted that Johnson’s often-repeated 6,000 extra GPs pledge would be missed. Official NHS workforce statistics highlighted by the Royal College of GPs (RCGP) show that by September only an estimated 9,464 extra clinical staff had been recruited – far short of the 13,000 that should have been in post by then at a rate of 5,200 a year for five years, given the ARRS scheme had begun in March 2019. “Whilst progress in meeting this target is better than the GP [recruitment] target, it’s still slow and very concerning that this could be another promise that won’t be met,” said Prof Matin Marshall, the chair of the RCGP. “The impact of not having enough staff in general practice is being felt acutely both by GPs and our team members who are working to their limits, and our patients, who are facing longer waits fr the care they need. Meeting this [extra staff] target – and the GP target – will be vital to addressing this.” NHS workforce statistics show that in September there were still only 14 podiatrists, 38 dieticians and 79 mental health therapists working across the 6,600 GP surgeries in England. There were also just 47 health support workers and 252 health and wellbeing coaches, who advise on lifestyle. There has been much more progress in recruiting pharmacists, whose numbers soared from 153 in March 2020 to 2,626 last September. Similarly, the numbers of paramedics rose over the same period from just two to 256 and of social prescribing link workers – who direct people to non-medical activities, especially to tackle loneliness and depression – from 112 to 1,427. The number of physiotherapists in post at GP practices has also risen considerably, from six to 652. It is vital to recruit enough of all these kinds of personnel, Marshall added, because “these professionals, alongside GPs and our established nursing colleagues, can provide both excellent and appropriate care for patients but also free up GPs’ time for patients with complex health needs, who are most likely to benefit from our medical expertise.” Labour seized on the slow progress towards meeting the 26,000 target. “The Conservatives are on course to break another promise,” said Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary. “Their failure to invest in the GP workforce and the primary care staff that support them means that people are struggling to see their GP and end up turning up at A&E, which inconveniences patients, puts hospitals under greater pressure, and costs the NHS more money. The Tories’ incompetence is costing people dearly.” The Department of Health and Social Care has been approached for comment.",News/Society,"Tory pledge to bolster GP surgery staff set to be broken, say health leaders",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/09/tory-pledge-bolster-surgery-staff-to-be-broken-health-leaders
1/10/2022,"Jack Dromey, who has died suddenly aged 73, was a Labour politician and one of the leading trade unionists of his generation. He was elected MP for Birmingham Erdington in 2010 and sat on his party’s frontbench for all but a few months of his parliamentary career. His working life was devoted to the interests of his trade union members and later to those of the people he represented in the House of Commons. A dynamic and energetic man, he constantly sought a way forward in pursuit of whichever cause he was currently seeking to advance, yet he always tried to build a coalition of opinion in order to do so. In consequence, he was both immensely successful in his trade union and political campaigns and simultaneously won widespread respect, even from those who did not share his political opinions.  He spent 25 years as an official in the Transport and General Workers’ Union (later Unite) and a further seven years in the elected post of deputy general secretary. Twice he stood for the top post in the union, in 1995 and 2003. He was the elected Labour party treasurer from 2004, a post he held until he entered parliament. This brought him into conflict with Tony Blair in 2006, when it was disclosed that, without informing Dromey, the prime minister had accepted £3.5m in commercial loans on behalf of the party from three individuals who were subsequently nominated for peerages. Dromey was married to Harriet Harman, the longest-serving female MP – and “Mother” of the House of Commons – and took immense personal pride in her distinguished political career as a former cabinet minister and deputy leader of the Labour party, never hesitating to acknowledge the strength he drew from their marriage. It was his domestic support that enabled her career – he called her “the outstanding parliamentary feminist of her generation” – and he would dismiss any suggestion of conflicting loyalties between their personal and professional lives as “sexist claptrap”. Dromey first came to national public attention in 1976, then a bearded, young radical secretary of the Brent Trades Council, who represented the workforce, mostly Asian women, employed by the Grunwick print works in Dollis Hill, north-west London, who engaged in a two-year strike for union recognition. Born in Brent, Jack was the son of Irish parents who came to London from Cork and Tipperary in search of work. His father, Jimmy, was a labourer who had become a train driver, and his mother worked as a cleaner; their experience helped radicalise their bright son, who passed the 11-plus and travelled through London to attend what was then the Cardinal Vaughan grammar school in Holland Park. After leaving school and studying law for two years, Dromey worked in a local print shop. In the early 1970s he helped found the Brent Law Centre, where he first met Harman, when she worked there as a solicitor; she would become the legal adviser to the Grunwick strikers. For 10 years he was a member of the executive committee of the National Council for Civil Liberties (now Liberty), where Harman was the legal officer from 1978 to 1982, the year the couple married and she entered parliament in the Peckham byelection. Despite the gulf between their social backgrounds – Harman’s parents were a doctor and a lawyer and she a former pupil of St Paul’s girls’ school – their marriage was “blissfully happy” according to friends’ accounts. They were dubbed “Mr and Mrs Moderniser” when Blair took office and Harman was first appointed to the cabinet. Dromey, always a funny man with a sharp sense of humour, would sometimes dub himself “Mr Harriet Harman, nee Dromey”. As a young activist he was a Marxist – although “more of the Groucho tendency” he would later joke – was a member of the now defunct Socialist group Solidarity, and had been involved in the occupation of the Centre Point tower block in a 1973 protest against homelessness in central London. He learned the importance of pragmatism but was uncompromising about his personal beliefs. “I was born on the left and I will die on the left,” he said. He became a district officer for the TGWU in 1978 and the national officer for public service workers in 1984. He first ran for the post of deputy general secretary in 1991, and although then unsuccessful he had by this time established himself as a highly effective organiser and someone with both vision and drive. “He was head and shoulders above any other union officer I had ever come across in terms of his strategic approach,” said his former Unite colleague Chris Kaufman. He represented defence industry workers for a decade, which gave him an understanding of the patriotism that exists in the British workforce and which, in turn, informed his skilful political campaigning. During one campaign, in 2003, he secured national publicity by offering honorary union membership to the Prince of Wales. Dromey first tried for a seat at Westminster in advance of the 1997 general election, but failed to make the shortlist for Pontefract and Castleford. He had also hoped to contest a seat had there been a general election in 2007, as was anticipated when Gordon Brown took over as Labour leader and prime minister. It was claimed two years later, however, that a £1m TGWU donation to Labour party funds had been part of a deal to secure a safe seat for Dromey in the event of an election. He won selection for Birmingham Erdington in February 2010, when the sitting Labour MP Siôn Simon stood down shortly before the general election in May. The first of the new intake of MPs to make a maiden speech in the 2010 parliament, he spoke of the importance of industrial activism, which he called “that necessary partnership between industry and good government”. He was always heard with respect by the Commons because of his industrial experience and because he spoke with an understanding of what he called “the real world and the real economy”. When Ed Miliband became Labour leader in September 2010, he appointed Dromey shadow minister for housing. In 2013 Dromey was switched to the home affairs team with responsibility for the police, a post he retained under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn until 2016. He resigned from the frontbench that year, having supported Owen Smith’s unsuccessful challenge to the leader, but was subsequently reappointed by Corbyn as spokesman on Labour until 2018 and on pensions until 2021. He was a member of the select committee on business, innovation and skills in 2010 and on regulatory reform from 2010 to 2015. Keir Starmer made him shadow postmaster general in the Cabinet Office team early last year and only in December gave him additional responsibility to speak on immigration issues, which he did for the first time on the day before his death, in a parliamentary debate on the problems of the Afghan immigrants to the UK. He is survived by Harman and by their children, Harry, Joe and Amy.

1/10/2022,"Sir Philip Green and his family are poised to receive up to £2.5m more in payouts from their former Topshop retail empire on top of £50m paid out last year. The Greens, who owned Arcadia Group until it fell into administration in 2020, are in line for the payment based on an £11m loan secured by their Aldsworth Equity group against a former Topshop store in Norwich.  The collapse of the group resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs as 162 sites closed down, and in a £500m-plus pension scheme deficit. The Norwich loan arrangement, which is buried in administrators’ documents, prioritises the Greens’ debt above most other creditors. The payout comes on top of the repayment of a £50m loan issued by Aldsworth against Topshop’s Daventry warehouse which was setteld in May after the building was sold by administrators. In a new report sent to creditors of Topshop and seen by the Guardian, administrators say the 39,000 sq ft Norwich store, which Arcadia bought for £12m in 2016, has been sold for £2.5m and the Aldsworth fund will receive the proceeds, after costs. The latest administrators’ report on the Greens’ retail empire showed that unsecured creditors to Topshop alone are owed almost £140m. At least £36m of that money is expected to be repaid after the sale of the group’s assets including the Topshop brand and stock to online specialist Asos, but most creditors will not be paid in full. It previously emerged that more than 1,000 suppliers to the group are likely to get less than 1% of the money owed to them. In all, Arcadia Group Ltd, the parent company of Topshop, Dorothy Perkins, Burton and Miss Selfridge, owed creditors £800m when it called in administrators, according to a statement of the group’s financial affairs prepared by Arcadia’s board in 2021. The Guardian revealed last year that Arcadia Group had a pension deficit of £510m when it collapsed. Trustees of the scheme have so far received £185m from the sale of Arcadia assets as part of £210m in secured funds agreed under a 2019 deal between the pensions regulator and the Green family. The family, who benefited from a £1.2bn dividend from Arcadia in 2005, as well as more than £300m in interest payments on loans and rents on properties that they owned, put in £100m of extra funding into the group’s pension under the deal. The pension scheme is expected to receive more funds following the completion of the sale of Topshop’s long leasehold of its former flagship store on London’s Oxford Street to the parent group of furniture retailer Ikea. The scheme is on course to remain independent of the industry-backed pensions lifeboat, which caps future payouts to savers. The Arcadia trustees believe that despite the £510m deficit, there will be sufficient funds to pay more than the pensions lifeboat can offer. The Green family declined to comment.",News/Business,Philip Green could gain £2.5m payout on former Topshop branch,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/09/phillip-green-to-earn-25m-payout-on-former-topshop-branch
1/10/2022,"An Italian newspaper, a book of finely drawn sketches, a half-remembered photograph glimpsed on social media: these are the fragmented details of lost lives that Scotland’s only student-led cold case unit must make sense of. The group of criminology students at Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU) are investigating seven long-term unidentified bodies in partnership with Locate International, a community interest company dedicated to helping the families of missing persons to find their loved ones.  There’s a Port Logan woman whose body was found washed up on a beach on the south-west coast in 2006. As with all these cold cases, there is no suspected criminality, but many possible explanations remain for how she ended up there: did she enter the water inland and float downriver, or from Ireland or the Isle of Man? Students have been gathering information about boat, shipping and plane accidents, and also learning about drift trajectories while consulting an expert on the Dumfries and Galloway coastline. The unit has also undertaken an updated facial reconstruction, in consultation with Police Scotland, technology having changed significantly since the last one was created 15 years ago. A new appeal has already garnered a lot of positive responses, and students will now go through them to check every lead. The unit already has a fruitful relationship with the police, says Lesley McMillan, a professor of criminology at GCU and co-director of the unit. “We’re not trying to do somebody else’s job, but try to bring some added value.” She describes the unit’s role in terms of a big puzzle: “When we inherit a case we have some pieces of the jigsaw, so it’s our job to confirm that those are correct, and see what other pieces can we add. We have time to go down lots of different lines of inquiry, some of which may end up being rabbit holes. And even if we don’t complete the jigsaw, we can still pass our reports back to the police and it might be that five years later they find some other piece that only makes sense because of what we’ve added to the picture.” Dave Grimstead, a senior investigating officer at Locate, explains: “The police face such a significant challenge. If you look at 2019-20, data shows 154,000 individuals who go missing. There’s a real challenge to meet that demand, and then they’ve got a cohort of about 5,373 unsolved cases that are more than 12 months old, and over 1,000 unidentified bodies.” This is where Locate has attempted to fill the gap, Grimstead adds, “to advocate with the police and support families to find an answer”. As well as GCU, Locate works with 10 other UK universities and about 150 volunteers. While the focus is always on finding the missing loved one, Grimstead says that the investigations can bring some comfort to families by “reducing the ambiguity”. “It does make a huge difference for families knowing that [the investigation] was pursued to the best it could be, even if they’re not able to get that final answer.” The unit serves as a talent development programme for students and offers fantastic training in investigation, intelligence and analysis, explains Maureen Taylor, the unit co-director, who is a lecturer in criminology and a former forensic investigator. But it also brings fresh energy and inspiration to sometimes decades-old cases with students drawing on a range of specialisms and experts who offer their services pro bono, be that a forensic odontologist or an oceanographer. Another investigation concerns a man who was found dead in woodland near the village of Canonbie in Dumfriesshire, southern Scotland, along with a four-month-old copy of La Repubblica. “So one of the things we’re looking into is why might he have had that newspaper,” says McMillan. “We’ve arranged for the newspaper to be translated and to get an original copy so we can actually see how the stories appeared within the printed copy and if a particular story is prominent … Or is this a rabbit hole, and he’s carrying a newspaper because he wants to stuff his boots when they get wet?” A third case involves another man found dead in private gardens in Edinburgh carrying a plain paper sketchbook of scenes from Aberdeen, Ullapool and Inverness. These cases raise broader philosophical questions around what it means to be missing, says McMillan. “To be missing, you have to be missed,” says Taylor. “Someone has to report you missing. And unfortunately, even that doesn’t happen in many, many cases. Conversely, there are cases where a person does not want to be found: people have a right to disappear for whatever reason, for example, a person escaping domestic abuse. Family estrangement happens all the time.”",News/Education,Student sleuths: Scotland’s undergraduate-led cold case unit,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/09/student-sleuths-scotlands-undergraduate-led-cold-case-unit
1/10/2022,"The departure from the women and equalities committee of a Tory MP who faced accusations of sexism has been welcomed by some of its members. The Ashfield MP Lee Anderson, who boycotted watching England’s men in the European Championship over players taking the knee, was criticised for telling a female district councillor in his constituency to “stay out of big boy politics” in November. Samantha Deakin said she was a victim of “blatant misogyny and sexism”.  Anderson was appointed to the committee in May last year but stood down after six months, and was replaced in mid-December by the former equalities minister Caroline Dinenage. Anderson faced an internal party complaint for posting a sexist comment on Facebook in 2018, with the party asked to examine a post by Anderson in July 2018. It showed a photo of Anderson looking at the chest of a female canvasser in a vest top. He captioned the photo: “Out with some great knockers tonight in Skegby.” Anna Soubry, who was then the Conservative MP in the neighbouring constituency of Broxtowe, was made aware of the post and complained to the then party chairman, Brandon Lewis, and other senior officials. “Lee is an odious sexist,” said Soubry at the time. Anderson said he had left the committee “due to the time commitment required”, adding: “The meetings are always on a Wednesday, which is my busiest day. I felt I could not give the role the time and effort it deserved.” But other members of the committee said Anderson had not attended the majority of meetings during his time on the committee. Alex Davies-Jones, who is herself leaving the committee because she has been appointed to the shadow frontbench, said it wasn’t “going to be a big loss to the committee”. She said that when Anderson took up the position on the committee there was consternation among other members who feared he would be counterproductive to its work, but Davies-Jones said it “was a shame” he had not heard more from a wide range of evidence from people facing discrimination, including those with protected characteristics. “It would have made really good viewing to see him confronted by data, facts and experts in the field would have given him a greater understanding of the arguments put forward and maybe dispelled some myths.” Another member of the committee said: “He clearly put himself forward to disrupt the committee, but he failed entirely and has been replaced by a former minister who will be diligent. His departure will not be mourned.” ",News/Politics,MP Lee Anderson ‘will not be mourned’ after leaving equalities committee,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/09/mp-lee-anderson-will-not-be-mourned-after-leaving-equalities-committee
1/10/2022,"It used to be that the early bird would get the worm, but households, schools and even prisons can now have the invertebrates delivered free to their door – if they get a wriggle on. A Nottingham-based initiative, the Urban Worm Community Interest Company (UWC), is on a mission to “worm up” the UK by kickstarting an urban worm farming movement that can create high-grade fertiliser from banana skins and old socks.  The social enterprise has received a £50,000 grant from the national lottery to send out 1,000 packs of composting worms – known as tiger worms because of their red skin – to anybody with a DIY worm farm ready to house a population of 100. “Using worms to manage organic household waste is happening at scale all over the world, except in the UK,” said Anna de la Vega, managing director of the UWC. “The reality of climate change, natural resource depletion and mass urbanisation presents unprecedented threats to global food security and the survival of humanity.” As far as natural waste managers and fertiliser-producers go, worms are unmatchable: they can eat up to half their body weight in organic waste a day and reduce the volume of that waste by 90% in two to six months. “The process particularly lends itself to the urban environment with small-scale indoor, low tech and low cost systems,” De la Vega said. “With 83% of the UK living in cities, an urban worm farming movement is essential for future food security and provides easy solutions for our kitchen waste.” The worm castings – or worm manure – they produce is grade-A soil, rich in the 14 nutrients that plants need to thrive: just one tablespoon of worm manure per plant is enough for each growing season. For those who are still squeamish, De la Vega is quick to assure them that worms don’t smell – although the “wee” they produce, drained out of the bottom of the worm farm, is so powerful that it needs to be diluted before being used to fertilise the garden. A DIY worm farm can be made in anything that keeps the light out: the UWC website has videos showing how to dig deep and transform a plastic box, a chest of drawers and even a bag for life into a new, earthy home. Worms don’t even need your waste food: find a box, fill it with some damp, shredded paper, some cotton socks, an old wool jumper and you’re off. “Worms just want to eat and mate. If you give them enough food and space, they won’t try to escape,” said De la Vega. “If you don’t want them multiplying, don’t give them loads of food. They’re really clever: they’re hermaphrodites, so they can all lay eggs. But they don’t lay unless there’s enough food and space to sustain an increase in their population.” De la Vega has already sent worms to 26 schools across the country and one prison. She is particularly pleased about the prison. “Worms clear toxins out of the earth and leave it completely clean and richer – helping plants to grow,” she said. “That’s a message of rebirth, regeneration and forgiveness that I think it is nice to take into a prison setting.” De la Vega will help 1,000 lucky worm farmers to nurture their new pets: alongside videos on the UWC website, they will be sent another video a few months after starting their worm farm to instruct them on harvesting their fresh fertiliser. If the two-year scheme is a success, the national lottery has said it will plough another tranche of funding into the programme. “Of course they are keen to keep funding the project,” said De la Vega. “It’s because it’s worms; they’re interesting. They’re niche.” The benefits of worm farming  Tackles climate change: rotting food waste releases the greenhouse gases, methane and nitrous oxide, which are 13 and 310 times stronger than carbon dioxide.  Worms for all: low cost, low tech and perfect for the city. You don’t need a garden to keep a few worms. They will be very happy under your kitchen sink.

1/10/2022,"An investigation is under way after the famed white limestone Scala dei Turchi cliff in Sicily was “shamefully defaced” with red powder dust. The Scala dei Turchi, or Turkish Steps, is one of Italy’s most visited tourist sites and features prominently in the Inspector Montalbano books by the late author, Andrea Camilleri.  The cliff, which is shaped like a huge staircase jutting into the Mediterranean from the coast of Realmonte in southern Sicily, was vandalised on Friday night. Initial inspections established that the culprits defaced the cliff with red iron oxide powder, a material which is fairly easy to eliminate, as proven by the fact that marks on the lower part of the cliff have been partially removed by the sea. Volunteers in Realmonte began cleaning the remaining marks on Saturday. “The splendid white marl cliff of the Scala dei Turchi, an attraction of the Agrigento area for visitors from all over the world, has been shamefully defaced,” said Nello Musumeci, Sicily’s president. “We condemn the perpetrators of this cowardly gesture. It constitutes an outrage not only to an asset of rare beauty, but also to the image of our island. I hope the judiciary quickly identify those responsible.” Luigi Patronaggio, the chief prosecutor of Agrigento, has started an investigation and ordered tests on the material used in order to trace recent sales of red powder dust in the area and, ultimately, the buyers. Police are also looking for clues via video surveillance images. The Scala dei Turchi was submitted as a candidate for Unesco world heritage status in 2019. However, the landmark was temporarily closed and seized by prosecutors in early 2020 after years of complaints about its poor preservation. The cliff has suffered natural erosion but also from the huge number of tourists, some of whom have stolen pieces of rock, which consists of soft white limestone. The investigation also probed the ownership of the Scala dei Turchi, which for years has been contested between local authorities in Realmonte and Ferdinando Sciabbarà, who staked his claim of ownership of part of the coastline based on documents dating back to the 19th century. Sciabbarà was investigated for the occupation of state-owned land and other crimes connected with the preservation of the site. He was ordered to pay a €9,100 fine last summer and the land was returned to him. According to reports in the Italian press, Sciabbarrà is ready to sell his portion of the land to the local authority, on condition that a nature reserve be established.",News/World news,Italy’s iconic Scala dei Turchi cliffs defaced by vandals,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/09/italys-iconic-scala-dei-turchi-cliffs-defaced-by-vandals
1/10/2022,"So high have the stakes been set by Russia over the future security architecture of Europe, and so imminent is the threat of war in Ukraine, that the three separate meetings arranged between Russia and the west this week are drawing comparison with some of the great western-Russian exchanges of the past, from Yalta in 1945 to Paris in 1960, over the future of Berlin, and Reykjavik in 1986. Vladimir Putin, with his keen sense of his place in Russian history, would probably revel in these comparisons. Indeed, the very scheduling of the three meetings – a bilateral security meeting with the US on Monday, a rare meeting of the Nato-Russian Council on Wednesday and an Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) meeting on Ukraine on Thursday – is seen by some as a mistake.  Françoise Thom, a historian of Russia based at the Sorbonne, said: “There is nothing more dangerous than these summit exchanges, which, whatever one may say, inevitably feed into Russian ruling elites’ either paranoia or delusions of grandeur and intoxication with power. If the west is firm, the Kremlin concludes that it wants to destroy Russia; if the west offers concessions, the Kremlin concludes that it is weak and pressure should be increased. “Very often the best policy with Russia is that of silence and distance: do nothing, say nothing and stand your ground. Clinging to dialogue at all costs, especially when Moscow keeps us at gunpoint like a madman holding a hostage, only shows our weakness and encourages the Kremlin to escalate.” But Joe Biden has clearly taken the view that with allied self-discipline and unity, the risks of being seen to be rewarding Putin are outweighed by the need for dialogue, and diplomatic reconnaissance. Not to talk would be to feed the Russian narrative that the west is not prepared even to listen. Besides, it is billed as a dialogue, not a negotiation, officials say. The specific agenda of each meeting next week is subtly different, and while the west will want the discussion to focus on the sovereignty of Ukraine, and missile placement, Russia will want a response to its threefold formal demands set out last month in draft treaties: the withdrawal of US nuclear weapons from Europe, the removal of Nato forces close to Russian borders, and the legal permanent renunciation of Nato membership for Ukraine and Georgia, as part of a commitment to end Nato’s enlargement. One way or other, these have been the permanent demands of the Russian political elite for the past 20 years. Putin’s demands bear comparison with Dmitry Medvedev’s largely ignored European security treaty proposal in 2009, but this time the demands are being presented in a more peremptory fashion. Indeed, some western officials fear they have been packaged to be rejected. In Ukraine there is concern that dialogue with Russia on the future security architecture of Europe, under threat of blackmail and without a formal presence of the EU bloc, will be taken as vindication by Putin. From Putin’s perspective, he has already made progress, and can make more. Russian thinktanks such as IMEMO are claiming, for instance, that the meeting shows “the ice has already broken”. It is the bread and butter of diplomacy to judge whether to “parley” – as Churchill put it – with an adversary either in the open or through a back channel, or instead to sit tight and wait. Never is that judgment more acute than in the case of Russia. The cold war US diplomat George Kennan’s contention was that “Moscow is a special case”. It saw security “only in [a] patient but deadly struggle for total destruction of [the] rival power, never in compacts and compromises with it”. He said the Soviet Union under Stalin was a master at distorting bromide American offers of dialogue, for example over the future of Berlin in April 1949, into a full-scale offer to redraw the map of Europe. The solution was patience and containment. Henry Kissinger for a period was to argue that the state department was populated by naive men that believed well-constructed argument could persuade Russia. The whole idea of signing treaties with Russia was to misunderstand the mentality. Russia, it was said, operated by probing for weaknesses, “by kicking all the doors and seeing which fell off their hinges”. Alexander Cadogan, the UK Foreign Office’s wartime permanent secretary made a similar point in his diaries about asymmetry in talking to Russia: “Everything favours the evildoer. Any honest government fights (in peacetime) with two hands tied behind its back. The brilliant blatancy of the Russians is something that we can admire but cannot emulate. It gives them a great advantage.” By contrast, most politicians’ instinct is often to parley, or seek a reset or trust personal charm. Churchill once said all the world’s problems could be solved if only he could meet Joseph Stalin once a week. John F Kennedy argued it was better to “meet at the summit than at the brink”, something the US attempted more regularly after the shock of the Cuban missile crisis. Famously at the 1986 Reykjavik conference a personal rapport between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev led them to the brink of abandoning nuclear weapons. George Shultz, the US secretary of state recalled that in advance “there was a unique sense of uncertainty in the air … Nothing seemed predictable.” Gorbachev’s surprise plan, nearly taken up by Reagan, showed the value of dialogue, even if Margaret Thatcher later confided her despair with Reagan to Robin Butler, her cabinet secretary: “He knows nothing, Robin.” Reagan’s successor, George HW Bush, promised no more chaotic Reykjaviks, but at a summit in Malta in 1989, the first meeting since the fall of the Berlin Wall, he too was captured by Gorbachev’s sense of history unfolding (“the United States and the USSR are doomed to cooperate for a long time”) and by his plea that “we have to abandon the images of an enemy”. In reality, Gorbachev was betrayed at a dinner the next evening in Brussels where Bush gave Chancellor Kohl the green light for Germany’s unification, opening the long argument about the terms of Nato’s expansion eastwards, starting with East Germany. With Gorbachev crushed by events, the Bill and Boris show ensued. Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin, tasked with integrating Russia into the international system, met face to face 18 times, often clashing about Nato expansion, leading Yeltsin to describe a cold peace. The apogee may have been the summit in Birmingham in 1998, when relations were so intimate they exchanged their respective confidential briefing cards. That relationship probably collapsed in a phone call of uncontrolled fury over the Nato bombing of Serbia a year later. It showed that when fundamental interests conflict, as they did over Nato, personal relations take you so far. Thereafter the era of two men sitting alone to solve the world was over. Barack Obama signed a new strategic arms control treaty, Start, in April 2010 with Medvedev, but the return of Putin to the presidency in 2012 saw the reset fizzle out. In essence the dispute about the wisdom of dialogue comes down to whether Russia is seen to be driven by insecurity or imperial expansionism. In policy terms that meant choosing between an emphasis on arms control or Nato expansion. But there is also a professional diplomat’s aversion to unstructured large-scale gatherings, whether they involve Russia or not. Harold Nicolson, after a long diplomatic career, argued in the Commons in 1935: “It is a terrible mistake to conduct negotiations between foreign ministers … international negotiations were best left to the professionals. Diplomacy is not the art of conversation. It is the art of the exchange of documents in a carefully considered and precise form and in such a way that they cannot be repudiated later … Diplomacy by conference is a mistake.” The worry for the professional diplomat is that in the emotion of the moment, resolve dissipates and pre-set red lines are rubbed out, and allies betrayed. With the Biden administration, the expectation is this week’s discussions will be far more structured, predictable and scripted. In theory, since neither of the principals – Biden and Putin – will be present in Geneva, there should be no rush of blood to the head by men of goodwill, but instead a staking out of familiar positions. The US messaging, bolstered by the UK, has been carefully framed, and seems well coordinated with Europe. Expansion of Nato was inherent in the Nato-Russia Founding Act signed by Boris Yeltsin in 1997. No country can determine another country’s foreign alliances, as Russia agreed in the Helsinki Final Act 1975, and again in the Budapest memorandum in 1994. In the words of Sauli Niinistö, the Finnish president, in his striking new year address: “Spheres of interest do not belong to the 2020s. The sovereign equality of all states is the basic principle that everyone should respect.” But the test, according to Evelyn Farkas, a former US deputy assistant secretary of defence for Russia, will be whether Putin sees this week’s talks as a piece of political theatre, a moment to issue an ultimatum, or whether he sanctions Russia getting into the weeds, and starts to negotiate. Few hold out much hope for the latter.",News/World news,Is it good to talk?
