4/3/2022,"The retreat of Russian forces around Kyiv has left horrifying evidence of atrocities against civilians littered across the region’s suburbs and towns, turned into hellish war zones by Vladimir Putin’s invasion. As Ukrainian armoured columns rolled into Bucha, a town north-west of the capital, they found streets blocked by burned-out Russian tanks and military vehicles, and strewn with the bodies of civilians whom locals said had been killed by the invading forces without provocation. Photographs from the town showed a scene of devastation, with hunks of charred and destroyed tanks and armoured vehicles lined up along one street, along with dead bodies. Reporters from Agence France-Presse saw at least 20 bodies, all in civilian clothing, strewn across a single street in Bucha, and the body of a missing Ukrainian photographer, Maksim Levin, was discovered in a nearby village. Three of them were tangled up in bicycles after taking their final ride, while others had fallen next to bullet-ridden and crushed cars, AFP reported. One had his hands tied behind his back with a white cloth, and his Ukrainian passport left open beside his corpse, said journalists who accessed the ravaged town. “All these people were shot,” Bucha’s mayor Anatoly Fedoruk told AFP, adding that 280 other bodies had been buried in mass graves in the town. “These are the consequences of Russian occupation.” Ukrainian soldiers in Bucha, who were welcomed warmly by residents of the town, attached cables to the bodies and pulled them off the street for fear they may be booby-trapped. Soldiers also cleared barricades and inspected suspicious objects, placing red rags on remnants of unexploded ordnance to draw attention to the possibility of explosions. As the town was liberated, one woman, Halyna Tovkach, 55, told the Guardian that she was searching for the body of her husband, Oleg, 62. He was killed by Russian soldiers along with their neighbours, two young boys and their mother, as they tried to escape the town on 5 March. “It is a war crime,” said Tovkach’s son. Also allegedly among the civilians killed by the Russians was Olha Sukhenko, the head of the village Motyzhin east of Kyiv, and her entire family. An in another accusation of war crimes, Russian troops allegedly used children as “human shields” while regrouping its forces. Ukraine’s attorney general is gathering a dossier of claims about the Russian use of local children to avoid fire when in retreat from around Ukraine’s capital and elsewhere. Coaches of children were said to have been placed in front of tanks in the village of Novyi Bykiv, close to the encircled city of Chernihiv, 100 miles north of Kyiv. Britain’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said she was “appalled by atrocities in Bucha and other towns in Ukraine”. “Reports of Russian forces targeting innocent civilians are abhorrent. The UK is working with others to collect evidence and support @IntlCrimCourt war crimes investigation. Those responsible will be held to account,” Truss tweeted late on Saturday. Appalled by atrocities in Bucha and other towns in Ukraine. Reports of Russian forces targeting innocent civilians are abhorrent.The UK is working with others to collect evidence and support @IntlCrimCourt war crimes investigation. Those responsible will be held to account. Ukraine and its western allies reported mounting evidence of Russia withdrawing its forces from around Kyiv and building its troop strength in eastern Ukraine. The visible shift did not mean the country faced a reprieve from more than five weeks of war or that the more than 4 million refugees who have fled Ukraine will return soon. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, again repeated his warning that Russian troops want to capture the Donbas and the south of Ukraine. In his nightly video address on Saturday, Zelenskiy said “we are aware that the enemy has reserves to increase pressure in the east”. He nevertheless promised to take the fight to the Russians in the Donbas and as they retreated from the Kyiv region. “We are strengthening our defences in the eastern direction and in Donbas,” Zelenskiy said. “What is the goal of Russian troops? They want to capture both the Donbas and the south of Ukraine.” But Zelenskiy complained that the “global security architecture has failed” and that Ukraine has “not yet received enough modern western anti-missile systems” from its western allies, nor given aircraft. He added: “Every Russian missile that hits our cities, and every bomb dropped on our people, on our children, only adds black paint to the history that will describe everyone on whom the decision depended.” Multiple sources reported a series of explosions in the southern port city of Odesa on Sunday morning. “Odesa was attacked from the air. Some missiles were shot down by air defense,” the city council said in a brief statement on the Telegram messaging app. It said fires were reported in some areas but gave no indication what was hit in the attack. Ukraine’s peace negotiator, David Arakhamia, reportedly said that Russia “verbally” accepts the Ukrainian position on peace talks, AFP reported, except for the issue of Crimea. Moscow had also agreed that a referendum on the neutral status of Ukraine “will be the only way out of this situation”. Arakhamia also told Ukrainian television channels that any meeting between Zelenskiy and Russian president Vladimir Putin would “with a high probability” take place in Turkey. Elsewhere, Poland’s deputy prime minister has accused France and Germany of being too close to Russia in an interview published on Sunday, as he condemned Berlin’s behaviour towards Moscow before the invasion of Ukraine. “Germany, like France, has a strong bias in Moscow’s favour,” Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who is also leader of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, told German daily Die Welt in an interview. Kaczynski saved his strongest words for Berlin saying that for years the German government did not want to see what Russia was doing under the leadership of Putin “and we see the result today”. He added that “Poland is not pleased with Germany’s role in Europe”.",News/World news,‘They were all shot’: Russia accused of war crimes as Bucha reveals horror of invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/03/they-were-all-shot-russia-accused-of-war-crimes-as-bucha-reveals-horror-of-invasion
4/3/2022,"The food giant that owns the Cadbury brand is embroiled in fresh allegations of employing child labour after an investigation obtained footage of children working with machetes on cocoa farms in its supply chain. Children as young as 10 have allegedly been found working in Ghana to harvest cocoa pods to supply Mondelēz International, which owns Cadbury. Campaigners say the farmers are being paid less than £2 a day and can’t afford to hire adult workers. The Channel 4 Dispatches investigation, broadcaston Monday, comes more than two decades after the chocolate industry pledged to eliminate child labour. Ayn Riggs, founder of Slave Free Chocolate, which campaigns against child labour in cocoa farms, said: “It’s horrifying to see these children using these long machetes, which are sometimes half their height. Chocolate companies promised to clean this up over 20 years ago. They knew they were profiting from child labour and have shirked their promises.” The Cadbury revelations come as this weekend millions of pounds will be spent on chocolate treats for Easter. More than £300m is spent on Easter eggs and novelties each year, including more than 80m boxed eggs. The chocolate market is worth £5.6bn in the UK, according to the market research firm Mintel. It includes about 330m Cadbury Creme eggs which are eaten every year. Mondelēz, which made global profits last year of more than £3.3bn, has a sustainability programme, Cocoa Life. Its logo is marked on its products, including Cadbury Dairy Milk, and its website states: “No amount of child labour in the cocoa supply chain should be acceptable.” Under the Cocoa Life programme, Mondelēz had, by the end of 2020, mapped about 167,800 cocoa farms that supply its businesses in Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire, Indonesia, the Dominican Republic and Brazil. On one of the farms alleged to be supplying Mondelēz, two children with machetes were filmed by the documentary team weeding the plantations. Children were also filmed using sharp knives to open cocoa pods and swinging long sticks with blades tied to them to harvest the pods from the cocoa trees. None of the children were wearing protective clothing. The daughter of one farmer, claimed to be supplying Mondelēz, said she had sliced her foot open while using a long machete. On one of the smallholdings, a niece of the farmer said she thought she was going to her uncle’s farm to help with childcare but claims she was being forced to work long hours on the farm and not allowed to go to school. When asked why she did not speak out, she said she was “afraid”. Under Ghanaian law, it is illegal for children under 13 to work on cocoa farms. There is also a ban on anyone under 18 being involved in hazardous labour. Ghana is the world’s second biggest cocoa producer after Côte d’Ivoire, and the crop, along with gold, is one of its most valuable exports. A cocoa farmer will typically receive 7p from a milk chocolate bar costing £1 in the UK, and 11p from a dark chocolate bar. It means many live in extreme poverty while facing rising costs from the impacts of climate change, because of unpredictable weather patterns and changes in crop-threatening pests and diseases. Ninety percent of the world’s cocoa beans are harvested on small, family farms with less than two hectares of land. In 2001, a cocoa industry agreement agreed to eliminate child labour. It was backed by the World Cocoa Foundation, a trade group whose members include the world’s biggest cocoa and chocolate companies, Nestlé, Mars Wrigley and Mondelēz. But the protocol’s targets were postponed and adjusted in 2005 and 2008. A revised target in 2010, to reduce the worst forms of child labour in the cocoa sector in west Africa by 70% by 2020, has been missed. Campaigners say child labour is still endemic in the chocolate industry. A study by the social research group NORC at the University of Chicago in 2020 found 1.56 million children were involved in the cocoa industry in Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire. The report found prevalence rate of child labor in cocoa production among agricultural households in cocoa growing areas of Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana increased between 2008/09 and 2018/19. There was a 62 percent increase in cocoa production in the two countries during this period. Joanna Ewart-James, executive director of Freedom United, an international organisation campaigning against child labour in the cocoa supply chain, said: “Child slavery and child labour have plagued the industry in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana – which produce 60% of the world’s cocoa – for decades. Cocoa farmers are not earning an income that enables them to recruit the labour they need.” On Friday, Freedom United will publish a scorecard rating global chocolate firms on their labour and environmental practices. The campaign group says Mondelēz has invested in community initiatives to combat child labour but, along with other leading companies, needs to pay farmers more money for its cocoa. Slave Free Chocolate compiles a list of chocolate companies that use ethically grown chocolate. Martin Short, president of the World Cocoa Foundation, said: “Dealing with child labour abuses as a standalone issue will never work until we deal with the root cause of child labour, which is farmer poverty.” Cadbury, one of Britain’s most famous companies, was controversially taken over by the US food firm Kraft Foods in January 2010. The American food giant changed its name to Mondelēz International in October 2012. Mondelēz considers a wide range of measures are required to combat child labour. The company has been involved in research which shows that increasing the price of cocoa will not on its own lift many farmers out of poverty, because they are farming on small amounts of land. A Mondelēz International spokesperson said: “We’re deeply concerned by the incidents documented in the Dispatches programme. We explicitly prohibit child labour in our operations and have been working relentlessly to take a stand against this, making significant efforts through our Cocoa Life programme to improve the protection of children in the communities where we source cocoa, including in Ghana. “The welfare of the children and families featured is our primary concern and we commit to investigating further so we can provide any support needed. As part of our Cocoa Life programme, we have child labour monitoring and remediation systems in place in Ghana, which means community members and NGO partners are trained to provide assistance to vulnerable children, and once identified, we can help to address any cases of child labour.” The company said it had requested additional information from the Dispatches team so it could investigate.Cadbury Exposed: Dispatches is on Channel 4 at 8pm on Monday",News/Law,Cadbury faces fresh accusations of child labour on cocoa farms in Ghana,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/apr/03/cadbury-faces-fresh-accusations-of-child-labour-on-cocoa-farms-in-ghana
4/3/2022,"New York is accustomed to high-profile trials, the details picked over like canapés at a cocktail party. But the trial of Lawrence “Larry” Ray, on federal charges of sex trafficking, extortion and conspiracy has caused revulsion and horror, and raised troubling questions that go far beyond criminal justice. Over the past three weeks, jurors have heard how Ray, 62, spent years psychologically manipulating and abusing college students who were roommates of his own daughter at the prestigious liberal arts college Sarah Lawrence. Ray’s methods echo the abuse described in other notorious recent cases such as the Nxivm sex cult and the Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell sex-trafficking cases. It certainly rivals them for allegations of abuse of the victims. The court heard how one graduate, Claudia Drury, was forced to prostitute herself to pay the ex-convict Ray $2.5m in compensation for what prosecutors call their imagined crimes against him. “I became a prostitute,” Drury said during testimony. Drury alleged Ray had tortured her for hours, suffocating her with a plastic bag after binding her to a hotel chair. At one point, she said, he stopped to have burgers and fries. Ray has pleaded not guilty to 16 charges against him, including sex trafficking and violent crime in aid of racketeering. Harvard medical school graduate Felicia Rosario testified that after being introduced to Ray by her brother Santos, a Sarah Lawrence student, she began a relationship, before he urged her into extreme sexual situations, encouraging her to have sex with strangers in Walmart or Home Depot and to consider becoming an escort. Rosario testified that the encounters had made her feel “disgusting, ashamed, embarrassed, not human, used, trash, small”. Disturbing video, filmed by Ray himself or by a woman described as his alleged accomplice, Isabella Pollok, who has pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately, was played in court. “He would tie me up with zip ties at my ankles and wrists,” Rosario told the jury. “He punched me in the face. Slapped me. Pulled me by the hair.” During testimony, Ray sat impassively. He picked Kleenex tissues from a box to wipe his eyes– a gesture that seemed to signal that whatever abuse Rosario, 38, alleges she suffered at his hands, he believed he was in fact the victim. For experts, that is classic cult leader behavior. “When you manipulate people psychologically to become enslaved like this, it’s a skill,” said former sex crimes prosecutor Wendy Murphy. “People think that if they send their daughters to Harvard or one of the Ivy League schools, they’ll at least be safe. But that’s not necessarily true,” she added. During opening statements, Ray’s defense attorney compared the case to Alice in Wonderland, urging jurors to travel “through the looking-glass” and invited them to view the defendant and the students as a group of “storytellers”. The danger for prosecutors in the case, says Murphy, is that the level of alleged abuse is in a sense unbelievable, because it is outside the realm of most people’s experience. “We can get unjust results in cases like this, because the horror of it all makes ordinary jurors who don’t have any understanding so uncomfortable that they have to psychologically distance themselves so it feels OK. They have a tendency to disbelieve, because its so painful to accept the reality. It can be tremendously unfair to victims,” she said. What has become known as the Sarah Lawrence case began in 2019 when New York magazine published a lengthy exposé, “Larry Ray and the Stolen Kids of Sarah Lawrence”, which triggered an FBI investigation. Ray, who actually participated in the article, was arrested in February the following year. “It’s remarkable seeing how much of this evidence the government is relying on is generated by him, and things he even put online,” Ezra Marcus, one of the journalists who unearthed the alleged conspiracy after he learned from fellow Sarah Lawrence College alumni about a “troubling” website about an ex-student there, told a Law & Crime podcast last week. “It was circulating through the alumni community, and just people being like, ‘What’s going on here?’ I mean, this stuff is seriously unsettling,” said Marcus. Prosecutors allege Ray created a cult-like criminal enterprise after moving into his daughter’s on-campus dorm in 2011. A statement issued by the college said: “While it is not unreasonable to expect that we will know when something is happening on our campus, in fact college officials at the time didn’t know.” Ray had recently been released from prison for his involvement in the securities-fraud scheme and he set himself up as a father-figure among the students, brandishing impressive credentials, often part true and part false. It is also a story that has involved in some of New York’s biggest and most bold-faced names. In 1995 Ray met Bernie Kerik, an NYPD officer who had risen from being Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s driver to the director of the New York City department of corrections’ investigations division. Ray was best man at Kerik’s wedding, drove Mikhail Gorbachev around town on a trip to New York, and travelled to Kosovo, allegedly to buy US-supplied Stinger missiles back before they fell into Russian hands. He became an FBI informant, duping the agency with promises of informing on the mafia in what would turn out to be a cover for his own involvement in mafia-related stock manipulations. In 2015, he worked as a bodyguard for Donald Trump. By then, Ray’s alleged prostitution ring was in operation. “He was mind-screwing these kids to the max,” Kerik said after Ray’s arrest. “He was just a sick dude.” During the trial, the US attorney’s office accidentally released an unredacted list of 121 clients from across all walks of life in New York’s social elite, including – allegedly – a retired state judge, a well-known architect, a successful artist and senior financial figures. Soon after, Ray claimed to be ill and was wheeled out of court on a stretcher for the second time since his trial started. But Ray’s schemes allegedly went even further than New York. Last week prosecutors told Judge Lewis Liman that Ray laundered money through his daughter’s links to North Carolina’s Democratic party. The jury later heard Rosario describe funneling money from Ray to his daughter Talia, who was then working for a local political candidate. According to Joni Johnston, a clinical forensic psychologist, the case not only highlights the vulnerability of young women at college, but speaks to institutional and parental failure to recognize psychological manipulation and enmeshment. Each of Ray’s alleged victims have testified that their relationship with him started from a place of trust and advanced to romance and then into years of violent sexual abuse. Johnston called them “cults of two”. “The techniques of manipulation, control, coercion, abuse isolation and humiliation are so similar to more formal cults where one person makes all the rules,” Johnston says. “We used to go, wow, how did 900 people die as a result of one man [as at Jonestown in 1978]? But now I think we’re becoming aware of all sorts of variants of that.”",News/US news,Disturbing claims of torture and sexual abuse at trial of New York ‘cult’ leader,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/03/torture-sexual-abuse-new-york-cult-trial
4/3/2022,"Trapped inside a house, stuck inside a vehicle that wouldn’t move, unable to complete seemingly simple tasks: this was the stuff that dreams were made on during lockdown, according to new research from University College London. Analysis of more than 850 dreams and nightmares submitted online to the Lockdown Dreams Project between March 2020 and March 2021 shows people often dreamed about having frustrating and restrictive experiences in mundane, everyday settings, like the home, at the height of the pandemic. Claustrophobic situations, such as finding yourself unable to leave your house due to a broken door handle, a lock or some kind of physical obstacle, were commonly reported early on in the pandemic. Many also dreamed about needing to stay indoors to escape a strange or uncanny scenario just outside their home. In one notable example, a dreamer reported seeing dangerous bears in their back garden, which forced them to stay inside, where it was safe. Overall, the study found that 71% of people reported having more vivid dreams during the first UK lockdown than before the pandemic. “Early on, it was very much related to claustrophobia and feeling trapped,” said Jake Roberts, one of the researchers on the project. But as the pandemic wore on, dreams began to be filled with more bureaucracy and transport problems. Roberts said: “Dreamers would be trying to get from A to B by commuting or doing something they would do every day – and then, something quite uncanny would happen. Something wouldn’t work, the vehicle won’t go where they wanted it to or they would have to abandon it and go on foot. These were all common occurrences in the collection.” For these dreamers, there was a sense that “you were no longer in control of where you were going, as a really good metaphor for the lack of freedom of movement”. Covid was rarely represented directly in the dreams but symbolically appeared everywhere, Roberts said. He described a dream one person had reported in which they needed to “catch” a fish in order to acquire documentation that would allow the dreamer to get off the ship they were on. “It had a very allegorical quality.” Family was also a huge part of people’s dreams, with many dreamers reporting a sense of the loss of loved ones, either real or imagined. Sometimes people dreamed about seeing friends and family just outside their home and being unable physically to get to them. “But what became apparent as we went on is that people were referring back to childhood memories of being around people who had maybe passed away years ago.” Roberts thinks perhaps dreamers who were experiencing the pain of being unable to see their loved ones were trying to process their feelings and simultaneously “seeking solace in a childhood idyll”.",News/World news,Covid lockdown dreams reflected our claustrophobia and lack of control,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/03/covid-lockdown-dreams-reflected-our-claustrophobia-and-lack-of-control
4/3/2022,"When Putin’s forces invaded Ukraine, anti-war Russians such as Kai Katonina, a 31-year-old designer who lives in Berlin, joined protests around the world. Katonina held up a sign that read “No to war”, but few in the crowd knew that they (Katonina’s preferred pronoun) were Russian. They said: “Onlookers thought we were Ukrainians because our people look the same. It was crucial for us to stand apart and show that Russians also oppose the war. We needed to identify ourselves.” Katonina said it was obviously impossible to go to the protests with the country’s traditional white, blue and red flag. “Unfortunately, the Russian tricolour has been completely appropriated by the state propaganda and the military,” Katonina said. “We needed a flag that had no connection to violence and war.” So Katonina and their friends came up with a solution: a white, blue and white striped flag. “It is as if someone threw white paint over the red, over the bloodshed that is going on,” Katonina said. But they were not the only ones to have the idea – it was soon seen at other protests around the world. “It was funny to see that at the very same time, other Russians opposing the war were putting forward the very same flag. Some unconscious collaboration was going on,” they said. The flag was originally used in Veliky Novgorod, one of the oldest cities in Russia and known as the cradle of national democracy – its citizens were full participants in representative rule as early as the 12th century. “The Veliky Novgorod symbolism was important to us. It was as democratic as a place could be in the 12th century,” Katonina said. The flag has since been embraced on social media as well as by Russian anti-war protesters on the streets. Russian poets, artists and musicians, as well as Russia’s main opposition movement, led by supporters of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, have also backed the use of the flag. The Free Russia Forum in Vilnius, a leading opposition group outside the country, called the new flag a symbol “of peace and freedom”. The group said: “Why is the new symbol important? Because it frees Russians of their ties to the Kremlin. By showing this flag, we – Russians – can say no to the war, no to dictatorship, and no to censorship. This isn’t the symbol of a state, it’s a symbol of people joining together.” Katonina said they were also inspired by the events in Belarus, where thousands of protesters used a white-red-white striped flag during rallies after the country’s disputed elections. This flag, first used during the short-lived Belarusian national republic in 1918, became such an irritant to the regime of President Alexander Lukashenko that even people wearing socks in its colours have faced prosecution. Unsurprisingly, the new Russian flag has also drawn the ire of the Kremlin, and officials last week proposed banning it as an “extremist” symbol. Vladimir Putin and state media have sought to create their own pro-war symbols. Most notably, the Latin letter Z has gone from being a military marking to the main sign of public support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But the new Russian flag has gained more traction among the country’s large émigré communities, which have been swollen by Russians who have left the country since the outbreak of the war. As Putin is effectively criminalising dissent over the war, tens of thousands of Russians have departed, and the main hubs of organised opposition movements are now abroad. Like-minded Russians have since been gathering at protests and anti-war concerts in cities across Europe, including Istanbul, London, Riga and Warsaw. At one of those concerts, given recently by the prominent Russian rapper Oxxxymiron, hundreds of Russians came together at the O2 Shepherd’s Bush Empire in London. “Millions of Russians are against this war,” the rapper said, as he stood over a cheering crowd … some of them waving the new flag.",News/World news,Red is dead: Russian anti-war protesters fly a new flag for peace,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/03/red-is-dead-russian-anti-war-protesters-fly-a-new-flag-for-peace
4/3/2022,"After thousands of articles and scores of books about Donald Trump’s mostly catastrophic presidency, it’s difficult for anyone to break dramatic new ground. But this new volume, with contributions from 18 American academics, is broader and deeper than all its predecessors, with essays covering everything from Militant Whiteness to the legacy of Trump’s Middle East policies, under the title Arms, Autocrats and Annexations. The result is a great deal of information that is familiar to those who have already plowed through dozens of volumes, enlivened by a few new facts and a number of original insights. One of the best essays, about the Republican party Trump inherited, is written by the book’s editor, Julian Zelizer. The Princeton historian reminds us that the “smashmouth partisanship” perfected by Trump actually began when Newt Gingrich snared the House speakership nearly 30 years ago. In 1992, Pat Buchanan’s speech to the Republic convention featured all of the gay-bashing Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, (and may other Republicans) have revived with so much gusto in 2022. With major contributions from Fox News, Rush Limbaugh and the rest of the rightwing media machine, most of the GOP moved so far right it didn’t become Trump’s party because he “seized control” but rather because “he fit so perfectly” with it. Most Republicans were “all in” for Trump, from Mitt Romney, the ex-never Trumper who voted with his former nemesis more than 80% of the time, to “moderate” Chris Christie, who gave Trump an “A” four months after his four years of scorched-earth governance were over. Nicole Hemmer, from Columbia, offers an excellent primer on the irresistible rise of rightwing media, reminding us that in the last year of the first George Bush presidency, Limbaugh was spending the night at the White House. By 2009, the shock jock “topped polls asking who led the Republican party”. By the time Trump started his run for the presidency, in 2015, he had “grown far more powerful than the political media ecosystem that had boosted his rightwing bona fides”. This became clear after his dust-up with Megyn Kelly. Moderating a primary debate, the Fox anchor challenged his long history of sexist statements. Trump declared afterwards: “You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.” The Fox News chief, Roger Ailes, “stayed silent”, Hemmer writes. Another executive, Bill Shine, “told on-air anchors not to come to Kelly’s defense”. By the spring of 2016, Fox was becoming less important than Breitbart, an extreme-right website which researchers at Harvard and MIT declared the new anchor of a “rightwing media network”. It was Steve Bannon of Breitbart who “armed Trump with something like a cohesive political platform … built on anti-immigrant, anti-Black, anti-Muslim, and anti-liberal politics – the same agenda Breitbart.com was promoting”. “Sure enough”, Trump’s Twitter feed “during the campaign linked to Breitbart more than any other news site”. Eventually, just about everyone on the right became a Trump disciple. Glenn Beck compared him to Hitler in 2016. By 2018, Beck was wearing a red Make America Great Again hat, though he blamed the media’s “Trump Derangement Syndrome” for “forcing him to become a Trump supporter”. As a former rightwing radio host, Charlie Sykes, explained: “There’s really not a business model for conservative media to be anti-Trump.” A Brown historian, Bathsheba Demuth, demonstrates that Trump was also a perfect fit for a party that endorsed a propaganda initiative of the American Petroleum Institute that portrayed environmental protection as “a dangerous slide toward communist authoritarianism”. Among loyal constituents were evangelicals, who either saw human dominion over nature as “a doctrinal requirement” or just thought the whole debate was irrelevant because of “Christ’s imminent resurrection”. The most surprising fact in this chapter is that the fossil fuel industry was so sure Trump was a loser in 2016, it gave the bulk of its contributions to Hillary Clinton. Margaret O’Mara, of the University of Washington, describes big tech’s key role in our national meltdown. She reminds us of a key, mostly forgotten moment 10 years ago, when “Google and Facebook successfully petitioned the Federal Election Commission for exemptions from disclaimer requirements” that required political ads to say who paid for them and who was responsible for their messages. The companies argued the requirements would “undermine other, much larger parts of their businesses”. Disastrously, the FEC went along with that pathetic argument. After that, no one ever knew exactly where online attack ads were coming from. O’Mara also recalls that Facebook provided the 2016 Trump campaign with “dedicated staff and resources” to help it purchase more ads on the platform. O’Mara mistakenly reports that the Clinton campaign received the same kind of largesse. Actually, in what may have been the campaign’s single worst decision, it refused Facebook’s offer to install staffers in Clinton’s Brooklyn headquarters. Another chapter, by Daniel C Kurtzer of Princeton, analyses what Trump supporters consider their president’s greatest foreign policy achievement: the initiation of diplomatic relations between Israel and Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Sudan and Morocco. A conservative journal summarized the accomplishment this way: “Washington is strengthening repression in Bahrain, underwriting aggression by UAE, sacrificing the Sahrawi people [of Western Sahara, to Morocco], undermining reform in Sudan and even abandoning justice for Americans harmed by Sudan. The administration calls this an ‘American first’ policy.” The last chapter focuses on the two failed attempts to convict Trump in impeachment trials. Those outcomes may be Trump’s worst legacy of all. Gregory Downs, from the University of California, Davis, writes that the failures to convict “in the face of incontrovertible proof” may convince all Trump’s successors “that they have almost complete impunity as long as they retain the support of their base, no matter what the constitution says”.

4/3/2022,"We have passed the Ides of March, and Boris Johnson is still in office. Until the start of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, the conventional wisdom held that the skids were under the prime minister: his nine political lives were almost exhausted and he was seriously threatened by the none-too-subtle manoeuvres of his neighbour, Chancellor Sunak. Then Putin emerged as an unlikely deus ex machina and the conventional wisdom became that Johnson was once more safe. Folklore tells us it is an ill wind that blows nobody any good: this truly terrible carnage in Ukraine has prompted certain observers to say this is “Johnson’s Falklands”. Anyone who believes this needs help. In 1982, Mrs Thatcher was the most unpopular British prime minister since records began. She took a huge gamble in sending a “taskforce” to take on the Argentinians, who had invaded the Falklands. It is a long story, but the gamble came off, and Thatcher sailed to her second election victory in 1983. There is simply no parallel, and even suggestions that the UK cannot say goodbye to a prime minister in wartime do not stand up to historical precedent. No matter how much he squirms, Johnson is haunted by the public’s rightful indignation over partygate, and much that went before. The serial lawbreaker is on weak ground when he professes to lecture Putin on international law, and he has shown himself to lack the judgment we require of leaders when comparing Ukraine’s struggle to Brexit. If one episode were needed to prove that Johnson, for all his apparent political acumen, is in fact a fool, it was that absurd claim. But the absurdity does not stop there. We are told there is a “festival of Brexit” in the offing; what is more, the “wonders” of Brexit are going to be a main feature of his next general election campaign, if he survives that far. Which brings us back to the chancellor. If the Roman poet Horace had been asked to forecast the impact of Sunak’s spring statement, he would no doubt have revived a line from his Ars Poetica: “Parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus” (“The mountains will go into labour, but all they will give birth to is a ridiculous mouse.”) For the chancellor, who had achieved enormous popularity by alleviating the financial consequences of Covid, managed, in that popular phrase, to go from hero to zero within 24 hours. This was partly the result of his manifest neglect of the hard-pressed, and partly of his disastrous attempt to present himself the next day as a “chancellor of the people”. However, although there is a widespread impression that Johnson has seen Sunak off, I should like to suggest that the chancellor has, possibly unwittingly, put the political knife into the prime minister. Let us face it: even before this budget, the British economy was in serious trouble. It was not alone: the sharp rise in commodity prices precipitated by the Ukraine crisis has turned what economists call the terms of trade – import prices in relation to export prices – against us and other countries dependent on imports of energy, among other things. As John Llewellyn of Llewellyn Consulting says, it is reminiscent of the oil crisis of the early 1970s: “Rising commodity prices reduce national income first, and that in turn affects domestic output.” Now, a seriously rattled chancellor is reported to “viscerally hate” the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. This is because it has embarrassed him by doing its job: for example, pointing out that the UK has lost 15% of overseas trade as a result of Brexit; that household income is likely to fall at the sharpest rate since the 1950s; and that 27 million people on the basic rate of income tax are set to see a rise in income of 4% while inflation is close to double digits – in other words, not much sign of the post-EU pay boom promised as a result of the Brexit onslaught on immigration! The result is that the collapse in real incomes and therefore spending power is likely to make the government even more unpopular than it now is. Not to put too fine a point upon it, the threat of recession looms. Yet Sunak is, essentially, planning another era of austerity. I have read suggestions that Sunak has become a prisoner of the Treasury, which, except for a period when Gordon Brown was chancellor, has always wanted to cut public spending. But Sunak is a willing prisoner. He is so un-Keynesian that he wishes to cut public spending even at a time like this. He may have receded as a candidate to replace Johnson immediately. But I suspect that his reluctance to use fiscal policy to counteract recessionary forces bodes ill for Johnson’s government.",News/Business,"Even now, Sunak and the Tories cannot let austerity go",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/03/even-now-sunak-and-the-tories-cannot-let-austerity-go
4/3/2022,"Lord Norman Foster, the 86-year-old architect, is mostly known for things that don’t move: grand, iconic edifices such as the Gherkin and the British Museum’s Great Court in London, the Reichstag in Berlin and the Apple Park campus in California, completed in 2018. OK, he was also part of the team behind the Millennium Bridge over the River Thames, which swayed so alarmingly on its opening day it was renamed “the Wobbly Bridge”, but that was resolved soon enough. As a human being, though, Foster is constantly in motion. He lives between the UK, Switzerland, Spain and the United States. With his architecture studio Foster + Partners, and foundation, he has realised projects on six continents (come on Antarctica, commission him!). His favourite recreations all involve mobility and speed: sports cars, riding his racing bicycle and flying (he’s qualified to pilot both jets and helicopters). This past winter he completed his “28th or thereabouts” cross-country skiing marathon. Foster has a laser mind, so that number is almost certainly spot on. We did mention he was 86, didn’t we? When I point out this modest incongruity, Foster laughs. “The family motto is ‘the only constant is change’,” he says. “It sounds a bit pretentious, but it’s kind of embedded in our DNA and I think it’s true of anything. It’s true of history, it’s true of events, of architecture, of design, of everything. Everything in life.” Foster mulls it over some more. “I can’t separate one aspect of my life from any other: the one informs the other,” he goes on. “So yes, I see analogies between cross-country skiing or riding a bike, and the way in which you can capture a view with a room – the links with nature. When I started professionally as an architect, I passionately believed that if you had a shaft of sunlight, if you had a view, then you were going to be happier. The difference now is that it has been scientifically proven. So statistically, if you’ve had surgery in a hospital, and your bedroom has a view, you will leave that hospital earlier. You will recover faster than somebody with a room that might look on to a blank wall, for example.” This afternoon, Foster is in Bilbao, at the Guggenheim Museum, casting an exacting eye over an exhibition he has spent a good chunk of his life thinking about. It’s called Motion. Autos, Art, Architecture and considers the past, present and future of the automobile at a time that Foster believes is a pivotal one in its history. With the evolution of electric vehicles and self-driving cars, the dominant mode of transport for more than a century could be on the cusp of extinction. “This exhibition is almost like the requiem for the age of combustion,” says Foster, on a video call from the museum. Curating the exhibition has clearly been a dream commission for Foster, who today wears a look sometimes called “architectural casual”: black turtleneck, black blazer. Growing up on the outskirts of Manchester, during the Second World War and its aftermath, he was obsessed with planes and cars. Foster won a place at grammar school by writing an essay, in vivid detail, that described a duel between two drivers on the Nürburgring in Germany. That child has now been given free rein to assemble 38 of the rarest automobiles ever made, in one space. These include a Bugatti Type 57 SC Atlantic, of which four were made between 1936 and 1938, and only three still exist. Not all the selections are supercars: there’s a 1951 VW Beetle, an original Mini, a Willys MB Jeep. Foster doesn’t hide that there might be a subjective element to some of his picks. In the early 1960s, when he was an architecture student, he drove a Beetle across the United States with his friend, Richard Rogers. The men were partners, briefly, before going their separate ways and pioneering the British tradition of architecture known as “high-tech” in the 1970s, including the Pompidou Centre in Paris, the Rogers masterpiece, which opened in 1977. The pair remained close until Rogers’s death last December. “It was a very formative trip,” recalls Foster. “The America of that period was extraordinary culturally: the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright, discovering the work of Europeans like Mies van der Rohe, who really built their most important works in America. So, yes, an amalgam of the road, of travel, of insights, of culture, of architecture, the paintings, the music, the jazz… It was an extraordinary period.” Foster makes explicit the link between driving- culture and culture-culture in the new Motion exhibition. Alongside a muscle car and a lurid hot-rod in the Americana room, there is a Donald Judd sculpture and paintings by Ed Ruscha and Robert Indiana. Elsewhere, there is a huge Alexander Calder mobile, Henry Moore’s Reclining Figure and an Andy Warhol silkscreen of an 1886 Benz motorcar. “It’s really seeking to break down the barriers between what is art, what is not art, what is design?” says Foster. “To see how, in some cases, artists anticipated streamlining, before the streamlining of an automobile or an aircraft. So it’s really taking a holistic view of design.” If anything conforms to the idea of “the only constant is change”, Foster believes, it’s the automobile. When it came on the scene, it was viewed as an environmentally progressive gamechanger. Now, not so much. “At the turn of the 19th to the 20th century, the automobile was the hero,” says Foster. “It was the white knight that rescued the cities that were being engulfed by a rising tide of horse manure and dead carcasses. It beautified the city. Since then, it’s become the urban villain, the polluter in the same way that the horse was the polluter.” As for what happens next for the car, Foster has views of his own, but he has also asked 16 schools of design and architecture, from the Royal College of Art to universities around the world, to present visions for the future of mobility. They will tackle urban congestion, resource scarcity, pollution – big questions that Foster believes all designers and architects should be thinking about. Foster seeks out contact with younger generations: he’s proud of the fact that the average age in his architecture studio, which is the largest in the UK, is typically in the early-30s. So, Baron Foster of Thames Bank, how old do you feel? “I feel as young as the people that I’m working with and engaging with and sharing passions,” he exclaims. “I enjoy doing all the things that I’ve done all my life, and see no reason to change it.” We catch up again a few days later: Foster is now in London, overlooking the Thames on a bright, early-spring morning. He had expected the operations of Foster + Partners, which he founded in 1967 with his late wife Wendy, to slow dramatically during the Covid period. The company braced itself by furloughing 70 staff, who were unable to work from home, in March 2020. But, as it turns out, the business showed “remarkable financial resilience”, according to accounts released in January. Their profits – £36.2m before tax – were actually higher than before the pandemic. Foster + Partners has repaid the furlough money in full, around £500,000. “We were all surprised by the way in which the technology has worked,” he says. “And the energy and resourcefulness of the team. But I guess it’s also made us acutely aware of the importance of physically coming together. The lessons of history are that an event like that accelerates trends that were already apparent and magnifies them.” Foster has consistently shown astute business acumen. Richard Rogers would often give Foster credit for being a self-made man. At a time when many architects came from privileged backgrounds, Foster’s father was a labourer, then managed a pawn shop. When Foster started to see other British architects, competitors of his in the 1970s and 80s, going out of business, he realised instinctively that he needed to make his practice global. This led to one of his great early buildings, the HSBC headquarters in Hong Kong, completed in 1988 (Foster has admitted that his firm most likely would have gone bankrupt if it hadn’t won the commission). Today, the busiest region for Foster + Partners is the Middle East, where it has four offices. As vigorous as he is, succession is clearly on Foster’s mind. In the early 2000s, he was diagnosed with bowel cancer and told he might only have weeks to live. He has fully recovered, but in October last year, he sold a majority stake in Foster + Partners to the Canadian private investment firm, Hennick & Co. Foster and his family remain the second-largest shareholder and, going forwards, he imagines what he calls a “perpetual partnership model”, which will lead to an “orderly” transfer of power, initially among the existing 180 partners in the practice. I ask Foster what’s the defining personal quality he brings to his work. “Never being satisfied,” he replies. What does that mean for those who come after him? “You know, architecture perhaps more than any other profession is a team endeavour,” he says. “There are many professions involved, and then the realisation of an idea, a dream, however you describe it, into the realities of a building is a long drawn-out process and it involves extraordinary team efforts on a building site. If you visit any building site, it’s a wonderful surprise that a finished building comes out of that process! How you pursue that across continents, that’s really a stimulation and a challenge – and it’s beyond any single individual.” Foster’s work still has the power to divide. Only last month, a £30m design for a winery complex in Cuxton, Kent, was rejected by local councillors with one comparing it to a “Teletubby Palace”. Foster + Partners have also received criticism for continuing to design airports, despite the environmental concerns. For Foster, this criticism is completely wrong-headed. It would be entirely negligent of architects and designers, he believes, not to work on such projects. Foster has long been talking about the importance of “sustainability”: the Apple Park campus is powered by 100% renewable energy; Bloomberg’s European HQ in London has “gills” to aid its “breathing” and uses 70% less water and 40% less energy than typical office buildings. “Climate change and countering climate change is a design issue in the most fundamental sense,” says Foster. “It is totally about design.” Isn’t that a lot of pressure on architects? “One of the key ingredients in the most rounded sense of the word is ‘energy’,” he says. “And we do have sources of clean energy. Nuclear is statistically by a huge margin, the safest, carbon-free, cleanest form of energy. And, interestingly, in terms of waste, 10 million people die a year through poor air quality, either because they’re growing up next to the burning of animal waste, wood or coal, or just in poor air quality in cities. “Everything comes down, in the end, to design. Look out the window, everything that you see, whether it’s clean or dirty, polluting or otherwise, at some point has been designed and made. So yes, it’s a design issue.” Foster is at an age where many would be slowing down: he could kick back with his wife, Elena, and five grown-up children. Or spend more time driving some form of transport very fast and langlaufing through the Swiss Alps. Still, no one, at least in his earshot, is mentioning the word “retirement”. “Why would I?” he asks, more laughter. “If I enjoy doing what I do, why would I change it? Of course, at any point with any of us, there’s always the other side of the coin. But big picture no, absolutely not. I get the same buzz from designing buildings, working with people, educational workshops, working with the UN heading their Forum of Mayors, engaging with civic leaders, writing, drawing, sketching. I’m privileged to have many such opportunities.” Foster reflects for a second, “I think they’re my lifeblood, yes.” Motion.

4/3/2022,"The writer of a successful first novel – and they don’t come much more successful than Douglas Stuart’s Booker-winning Shuggie Bain – has two choices when it comes to the follow-up. Either they seek to prove their range with something entirely different, or they capitalise on that early success, giving readers more of what pleased them first time around. Stuart has opted for the latter course: Young Mungo is set in the same world and at more-or-less the same time as Shuggie Bain. It turns around the same basic friction: a young man growing up in grinding poverty who, because of talent, temperament and sexuality, is particularly ill-suited to the hard-edged world of the Glasgow schemes. If Young Mungo doesn’t raise the same immediate thrill as Shuggie Bain – the sense of discovering a new voice of coruscating brilliance – there’s a richer, deeper pleasure to be gleaned here. Young Mungo is a finer novel than its predecessor, offering many of the same pleasures, but with a more sure-footed approach to narrative and a finer grasp of prose. There are sentences here that gleam and shimmer, demanding to be read and reread for their beauty and their truth. Mungo Hamilton is the youngest of three children. They live on a Glasgow scheme rife with sectarian violence between the “Prodders” and the “Fenians”. The Hamiltons are Protestants, with the oldest brother, Hamish (known as “Ha-Ha”), the leader of a gang of teenagers who rob and intimidate the local Catholics. Jodie, Mungo’s sister, is a bright and ambitious young woman in a miserable and manipulative relationship with a teacher at school. Mungo is awkward, handsome and sensitive, with a tic and a patch of raw skin on one cheek. With their father long dead, all children live in the shadow of their mother, Mo-Maw, an alcoholic with the same mixture of charm, compassion and cruelty as Agnes from the previous book. Where Agnes sat at the heart of Shuggie Bain, Mo-Maw is notable here largely by her absence: she disappears for weeks at a time, leaving Ha-Ha and Jodie as the imperfect parents to the fragile Mungo. When she does appear, it is with tales of her pursuit of a new husband, or deep in her cups, when she becomes what the children call “Tattie-Bogle” – a “heartless, shambling scarecrow”. Young Mungo operates a dual narrative, with chapters alternating between a fishing trip that Mungo takes with two friends of his mother and a more expansive history of Mungo’s life leading up to this point. In the wake of an event whose facts become clear over the course of the novel, Mungo has been packed off by his mother with two men she’d met at Alcoholics Anonymous. We soon learn that the men – “St” Christopher and the younger, more sinister Gallowgate – have been in jail. Now they are here in the glens, “as near tae heaven as ye can get on three buses,” as one of the men puts it. The chapters beside the loch are dark and drenched with foreboding. The men are drunk by the time they arrive and as they grow drunker our fear for the 15-year-old boy sent into the wilderness with them mounts to an almost intolerable pitch. It’s a relief when we drop back into the past, although here, too, things are far from cheery. What struck readers most about Shuggie Bain was the way that Stuart managed to redeem situations of almost unimaginable awfulness through small moments of familial connection, through scenes in the home that managed to be deeply stirring without ever straying into sentimentality. In Young Mungo, again, he brilliantly summons a family, brings them to vivid life on the page, makes us love them for all their faults. There is also romance. Mungo comes upon a “doocot” (dovecot) one day while out sketching in an area of scrub beside the tenements. There he meets James, a Catholic boy who lives on the next street over. James is like no one else he’s met: gentle and softly spoken and obsessed by his doves. Mungo begins visiting the doocot more regularly, then going to stay at James’s house. What begins with pinky fingers locked in the dark of a bedroom grows into something more serious, a love that challenges two of the powerful taboos of the schemes: that men should be violent and violently heterosexual, and that Protestants shouldn’t mix with Catholics. I kept thinking of Alan Hollinghurst when I was reading Young Mungo. Hollinghurst, of course, writes of a different world and with a different kind of poetry in his prose, but there is so much here that recalls him at his best. The way that Stuart builds towards exquisite set pieces, moments in time that take on an almost visionary aspect; the powerful and evocative descriptions of sex and nature in language that soars without ever feeling forced or purple; the manner in which he binds you into the lives of his characters, making even the most brutal and self-interested members of the family somehow not only forgivable, but lovable. I sobbed my way through Shuggie Bain and sobbed again as Young Mungo made its way towards an ending whose inevitability only serves to heighten its tragedy. If the first novel announced Stuart as a novelist of great promise, this confirms him as a prodigious talent.  Young Mungo by Douglas Stuart is published by Pan Macmillan (£16.99).

4/3/2022,"This week, we shall be subjected to further appalling reports from Ukraine: murderous brutality and human suffering and resilience at its receiving end. President Vladimir Putin’s invasion has been condemned as the worst violence in Europe since the Second World War. But 30 years ago this week, a similar atrocity was detonated in Bosnia-Herzegovina. On 6-7 April three decades ago, as the US and EU recognised the fledgling Bosnian republic, Russian-backed Serbian and Bosnian Serb snipers and artillery gunners opened fire on the capital, Sarajevo, unleashing the worst carnage to blight Europe since the Third Reich – so far; one prays Ukraine will not usurp that awful title, if it hasn’t already. Commemorations in Sarajevo this week could not be more cogently timed: focused on Ukraine, not least because the echoes are very loud, viscerally clear and traumatically resonant. It’s like: “We’re with you not just because we’re with you, but because we’ve been there.” However, there are baffling differences. While most in the west rightly rally around Ukraine, the hurricane of violence against Bosnia’s Muslims and Croat Catholics met with bewilderment, apathy and – among the so-called international community – appeasement of, and even support for, the Serbian and Bosnian Serb aggressors. In Britain, leading the appeasement were men now described as “grandees” of the Conservative party: John Major, Douglas Hurd, Malcolm Rifkind – with keen allies on the organised and intellectual left. While the west has armed Ukraine’s resistance, an arms embargo on all sides, as leaders put it, strapped a ball and chain around the embryonic Bosnian partisan army and afforded the aggressor a calculated, overwhelming military advantage. While the nightmare in Ukraine drives the “international community” to seek a solution within three weeks, that in Bosnia was dragged on for three years. This week in 1992, Sarajevo came under prolonged siege, eight years after hosting the Winter Olympics. Almost every Muslim inhabitant of eastern Bosnia was either killed or displaced and many women held captive in rape camps. Villages and mosques were incinerated or else under relentless siege in isolated UN-declared “safe areas”. At the other end of the country, a crew from ITN and I revealed a gulag of concentration camps for Muslim and Catholic inmates in August 1992, which had operated since May, where thousands were killed, tortured and raped. In July 1995, three bloody years later, 8,000 men and boys were summarily executed within five days after the fall of the “safe area” of Srebrenica, the victims of this genocide delivered to their killers by the very powers and UN soldiers pledged to protect them. Bosnia is not only about the past: a survivor of the Omarska concentration camp, Satko Mujagić, is among those presenting an open letter from various Balkan and peace groups about current, heightened tensions generated by Russia’s Serbian and Bosnian Serb allies, who aspire to a Bosnian Serb “Donbas” secession from Bosnia. So why did not and does not Bosnia matter, as Ukraine rightly does? Marching through a sea of blue and yellow in London last Saturday, it was poignant to recall, by contrast, the trickle of protesters 30 years ago for Bosnia (whose colours are the same). “If we’d had a tenth of the public support for Ukraine, and a twentieth of the military support, the war would have been stopped, a hundred thousand lives saved; also three lost years and the homes of millions,” says Damir Sagolj, a Bosnian army guide during the war, now Pulitzer prize-winning photographer and director of the Warm (war, art, resistance, memory) Foundation, central to this week’s commemorations. Most of the 100,000 dead and two million displaced in Bosnia were Slavic Muslims and some survivors think the west’s connivance was because they are just that – Muslims. But many victims were Bosnian Croat Catholics and the same attitude pertained towards the destruction of Vukovar, the Danube city levelled into the dust of its own stone during Croatia’s earlier war of independence in 1991. I thought the slaughter in Bosnia may have been just too close, “so near Venice”, as the grateful Bosnian Serb vice-president Nikola Koljević once taunted me, satanically, with regard to western inaction. But that is disproved; part of the outcry for Ukraine is that, like Bosnia, it is part of Europe. Perhaps Ukraine musters righteous support in part because Putin has nuclear weapons, which threaten us all. Conversely, Serbian president Slobodan Milošević did not possess such an arsenal; almost every reporter on the ground in Bosnia, and most military analysts, knew that 48 hours of carefully targeted Nato air strikes could have ended the atrocity, as they did in 1995, three years late, when the Bosnian Serbs capitulated immediately after a brief round of pinprick attacks. So, even more reason to have struck at any time between 1992 and 1995, without risk of the war spreading. Perhaps people were shocked by Bosnia, and it was complicated, while Ukraine is manifestly Manichean. The notion of “ancient ethnic hatreds” was lucratively peddled by appeasers. But what is complicated or morally and politically confusing about “ethnic cleansing”, as Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadžić himself called it, concentration, rape and death camps and the modern-day siege of a European capital city? For Kyiv, read Sarajevo and vice-versa; for Mariupol, Goražde or Srebrenica. Columns are supposed to conclude with answers, not questions, but I have none. Why was it OK to collaborate in Bosnia with violence echoed by Putin now? In the aftermath and public sphere, why is it OK for the German writer Peter Handke to be awarded a Nobel prize, as he was in 2019, having written eulogies to the “Greater Serbia” project and given the oration at the funeral of President Milošević, architect of the genocide; and for supposedly liberal feminist Olga Tokarczuk to fawningly clasp Handke’s hand, accepting her own prize, while the mothers of Srebrenica tearfully demonstrated outside? For the former Trotskyite Claire Fox, Brexit star of GB News and RT, as well as BBC radio, who insists that the concentration camps were a fabrication, to be made a baroness? Why did not and does not Bosnia matter, as Ukraine absolutely does? The question has baffled – and the answer evaded – me ever since April 1992.

4/3/2022,"The Venezuelan photographer Alejandro Cegarra took this picture at an improvised asylum seekers’ camp in Matamoros, a city in the north-eastern corner of Mexico, on the south bank of the Rio Grande border with Texas. It is part of a series of pictures that Cegarra has taken of the “second wall”, the legacy of Donald Trump’s agreement with Mexico that refugees are returned across the border to await asylum hearings. The boy holding his head in his hands is from Honduras; the volunteers blowing bubbles are part of Bay Area Border Relief, a humanitarian organisation from San Francisco. Cegarra’s pictures, shortlisted in the documentary category of this year’s Sony world photography awards, shine a light on those thousands of childhoods lost to the escalating aggression of immigration policies. Having failed to get Mexico to pay for his mythical wall, in 2018 Trump threatened incoming Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador with tariffs on all Mexican goods unless he acceded to the “Remain in Mexico” policy by which asylum seekers would be held south of the border to await US court hearings. President Biden repealed this policy at the beginning of last year but it was reimposed by legal action from the Republican-controlled states of Missouri and Texas. When Cegarra took this picture, there were more than 75,000 people incarcerated in makeshift camps like this one at Matamoros, waiting for a hearing, and a backlog of more than 1m immigration cases in the American courts. Biden has pledged to have cases heard within 180 days, but on average the delays on asylum hearings are running to just under five years. Those waiting are vulnerable to extortion by people traffickers and drug cartels and brutalisation by local police. By the end of the Trump presidency, the percentage of successful asylum applications stood at 0.1% of all cases. The promised wall exists in brutal legal reality for the children in Matamoros, if not in concrete fact.

4/3/2022,"Government plans to waive border checks on goods from the EU – including food and livestock – will put the country at risk of importing devastating infectious diseases such as African swine fever and compound serious damage to UK trade caused by Brexit. The double warning has been issued by the British Veterinary Association (BVA) as ministers consider yet another postponement of post-Brexit inspections because of fears that checks will slow supply chains, add to bureaucracy and increase prices in shops at a time when UK consumers are already facing a cost of living crisis. The already much-delayed rules, including a requirement for veterinary certificates and potential spot checks after arrival, were due to be phased in from 1 July. Tough new rules on imports were initially hailed by Brexiters as examples of how leaving the EU would allow the UK to “take back control” of its borders. But now, amid growing evidence that Brexit is harming trade, senior figures in government, led by the minister for “Brexit opportunities”, Jacob Rees-Mogg, have changed tack and decided that less control rather than more is needed over imports in order to speed the flow of goods and reduce costs. But the relaxation of animal safety standards is worrying both UK vets and many in the farming community. James Russell, the senior vice president of the BVA, told the Observer he would be raising the alarm when he gives evidence this month to MPs on the international trade select committee. Russell said that dropping checks would not only endanger animal health and have serious consequences for the UK’s biosecurity but also compromise the UK’s reputation for high standards on animal and food safety, which in turn could damage the trust that overseas businesses have in UK produce. He said: “If these controls are dropped there is a potential risk of an incursion of African swine fever which is spreading rapidly and has already had a catastrophic impact on animal health and agricultural industry in parts of Europe, Asia and Africa. “Official veterinarians working at the border act as the country’s first line of defence of biosecurity, and we feel it would be deeply misguided to push back the need for these vital checks even further and in so doing weaken this layer of protection for both animal and public health.” According to the World Organisation for Animal Health, African swine fever is “responsible for massive losses in pig populations and drastic economic consequences” and “has become a major crisis for the pork industry in recent years. Currently affecting several regions around the world, and with no effective vaccine, the disease is not only impeding animal health and welfare but has also detrimental impacts on biodiversity and the livelihoods of farmers.” Russell added that if food substances were imported into the UK with no records of their origins and were then included in a “hybrid” product – such a pizza – that product would become more difficult to export into markets such as the EU where full details of product origins are needed. A further delay is, however, sure to be welcomed by many UK businesses which are already struggling with food supply chain issues made worse by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. James Withers, chief executive of Scotland Food and Drink, told the Financial Times last week that a decision to delay checks again would, however, infuriate UK exporters who had had to deal with mountains and paperwork and extra costs since the UK left the single market on 1 January last year. “There’s no doubt this will stick in the throat of a lot of exporters who are now 15 months into navigating a tsunami of paperwork that our EU competitors are not facing.” Ministers are conscious that the UK’s trade performance failed to recover from the pandemic nearly as fast as other leading economies according to recent data, with many blaming Brexit. The Office for Budget Responsibility has stuck to its prediction that leaving the EU will result in total UK imports and exports being 15% lower than if it had stayed inside the bloc. Last week the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, told the Treasury select committee that the UK’s poor trade performance compared with other G7 countries “might well be” due to Brexit.",News/Politics,"Swine fever risk if UK waives checks on imports from EU, say vets",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/03/swine-fever-risk-if-uk-waives-checks-on-imports-from-eu-say-vets
4/3/2022,"Eight hours before Donald Trump took the stage in the Detroit suburbs on Saturday, an army of canvassers darted along the line of people snaking outside the hulking sports complex where supporters of the former president were waiting to get in. “You guys think we’re gonna have a fair election?,” one canvasser asked Marco Braggion, 26 and Christian Howard, 25, who was standing in a cowboy hat and jean jacket. “We need to be able to work those polls to keep eyes on what’s going on.” It was an exchange that underscored how Republicans, stewing in doubts about the 2020 election, are organizing to take control of the machinery of elections – how ballots are cast and counted. And when Trump took the stage Saturday evening, his first visit to Michigan since 2020, that’s what he was focused on too. He was there to campaign for two-little known candidates who are seeking offices that wield significant power over voting rules in Michigan, one of the most important battleground states in the presidential election. Trump was stumping for Matthew DePerno, who is seeking the GOP nomination for attorney general, and Kristina Karamo, a Republican running to be Michigan secretary of state, the state’s chief election official. Both are seeking to earn the Republican nomination at the party’s convention in the state this month. Neither has any prior political experience and their political rise stems almost entirely from their efforts to spread misinformation about the 2020 election. Joe Biden defeated Trump in the state by just over 154,000 votes in 2020, and Trump’s efforts to throw out the election. If Karamo and DePerno were elected this fall, it would place two Trump allies in key positions from which they could potentially do what he could not in 2020: overturn an election result. “Remember this is not just about 2022, this is about making sure Michigan is not rigged and stolen in 2024,” Trump said in a meandering hour and forty-five minute speech in which he repeatedly insisted, falsely, that he won Michigan in 2020. “I have to be honest, I don’t do this often for state people, this is so important. What happened in Michigan, it’s a disgrace.” Karamo is a part-time community college professor who became a celebrity in Republican circles after claiming she witnessed fraud on election night while observing ballots being counted in Detroit. Those claims have been debunked, but she has nonetheless catapulted to the front of the Republican field in the secretary of state race. She joined an unsuccessful Michigan’s 2020 election from being certified and sought to intervene in an unsuccessful effort at the US supreme court seeking to overturn election results in key swing states. She has called public schools “government indoctrination camps” and suggested those who attacked the US capitol on 6 January were antifa. She electrified the crowd packed into the astroturf inside the Michigan Stars Sport Center on Saturday night calling Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat currently serving as secretary of state, “an authoritarian leftist who treats the people of Michigan like the unwashed masses.” “There’s an army of people across our state who are fighting back. Little MAGA warriors and we’re getting the job done,” she said, using the acronym for Trump’s slogan, Make America Great Again. Speaking to reporters earlier this week, Benson said Michigan was “ground zero” in the battle for American democracy. She said Trump was seeking to put loyalists in power who might succumb to future requests to undo elections. “We’ve also been fighting election-deniers, some of whom now want to take over statewide offices so they can potentially be in a position to block or undo or fail to certify election results that they disagree with in the future. That is simply what’s at stake this fall,” she said. DePerno rose to prominence last year as he spread false allegations of fraud in Antrim county, in Northern-Michigan, where a clerk made a mistake on election night and posted incorrect numbers that initially showed Biden leading. DePerno led a lawsuit against the county and spread incorrect information suggesting votes could have been switched. A government review and a separate GOP-led investigation of the incident found no evidence of fraud, and was unsparing in its criticism of DePerno. “No longer will we allow the elites in this country to control our elections and to control us,” DePerno said on Saturday. He has pledged to arrest Benson and Dana Nessel, the current Democratic attorney general. “[Trump] wants people who will manipulate the 2024 election to his advantage,” Nessel told the Guardian on Friday. “ Just a handful of years ago, they would have been seen as extreme, fringe candidates that never would have gotten any traction in the Republican party. And now, they are emblematic of the Republican party.” Outside of the rally, a soundtrack of songs that have become staples of Trump rallies - Elton John’s Tiny Dancer among them - blasted while some people played cornhole. Mike Lindell, the MyPillow CEO got thunderous applause when he briefly appeared. The most prominent canvassers were those seeking to get rallygoers to sign a petition for a ballot measure to “decertify” the results of the 2020 election in Michigan, something that is not legally possible. Organizers hoped to get 10,000 signatures at Trump’s rally on Saturday, said Janice Daniels, a former local mayor involved in the effort, who was collecting signatures on Saturday. She said she was unmoved by widespread legal agreement that the 2020 election cannot be undone and several reviews in Michigan that have affirmed the result of the 2020 election. “That’s what the enemies say. They want to discourage you from doing what is right and what is good and what is possible,” she said. “Extraordinary problems require extraordinary solutions. We’re in an extraordinary environment where we had a coup d’etat take over our entire government.” But some people at the rally acknowledged that decertifying the election wasn’t really a possibility. “I don’t think it’s possible, but it so should have been done. It’s a done deal,” said Diane Zechmeister, 67. Zechmeister said she didn’t follow election administration particularly closely until 2020, “when things went sideways”. A friend who attended with her, Carol Fischer, 68, said nothing could persuade her that the results of the 2020 election were accurate. “I will never believe that,” she said. Several polls since the 2020 election have shown that many Republicans continue to believe Trump won. Greg Taylor, 38, also was in line early to get into the rally to ensure he would get a spot inside. Even after state officials, and legislative Republicans in Michigan, have put out several audits and reports debunking conspiracies in Michigan, Taylor couldn’t think of anything that would persuade him the results of the election were accurate. “Not with what I’ve seen. I really, I just can’t see that,” he said. “The only way that we could know is, I guess, through an audit I guess. But who knows about the audit?” “It’s so hard to trust anybody. I don’t trust either side,” he said. Tyler Griffin, who was waiting in line wearing an oversized red cowboy hat, also said nothing could persuade him to accept the 2020 results. “I looked at all the numbers and it doesn’t add up.” Not everyone at the rally was enthusiastic about Trump’s continued focus on elections. Howard, the early rallygoer who was approached about being an election worker, said he hoped Trump would leave the 2020 election in the past. “I hope he kind of lets it go,” he said. “I know he’s not going to, but I hope he does.”",News/US news,‘I don’t do this often for state people’: Trump stumps for Michigan candidates in voting rights battle,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/03/i-dont-do-this-often-for-state-people-trump-stumps-for-michigan-candidates-in-voting-rights-battle
4/3/2022,"I won’t assume everyone knows what hyaluronic acid is or what it does. For those who know, feel free to come back next week. Everyone else, here goes. First: don’t let the word ‘acid’ terrify you. Yes, it sounds like a brutal liquid that should come with ‘use at your peril’ signage, but it’s nothing of the sort. Hyaluronic acid occurs naturally in the body and its purpose is to retain moisture. This function, however, is compromised by factors such as age and environmental aggressors. Hence it needs replenishing. Hyaluronic acid holds more than 1,000 times its weight in water and so, used topically, it helps to combat those diminished reserves leaving you with plumper, more youthful and super hydrated skin. But not all hyaluronic acids are created equal and choosing is a minefield. But hopefully the following will help. When hyaluronic acid is well formulated with say an active such as niacinamide, the results are way more impressive. Hyaluronic acid comes in different molecular weights – the most basic is, well, basic. But not bad. The results simply take longer to see. A mixed, more complex weighting of hyaluronic acid (like NIOD’s), however, will give you quicker results. Using hyaluronic acid to boost the effect of your other skincare products – as opposed to using it on its own – really supercharges its efficacy. It’s like a side dish that compliments your main course. Think of it like that and you won’t be disappointed. 1. Lancôme Rénergie HCF Triple Serum £76, johnlewis.com2.

4/3/2022,"Veuve Monsigny Champagne Brut, Champagne, France NV (£13.99, Aldi) Most of us have a few supermarket own-label brands that we like to think show off our shrewdness as shoppers. These are products charged with an extra frisson of smug self-satisfaction when we get them home and tell ourselves, “ha, and to think those rubes are stumping up twice the price for the same thing just because it has a famous name on the label.” Currently, the own-label wine doing the best job of convincing British shoppers that they have cracked some kind of insider’s code and found a way to cheat the rules that usually govern the relationship between price and quality is Aldi’s all-conquering Veuve Monsigny Champagne. Made by the hitherto little-known, family-run champagne house Philzot & Fils, it has, over the past five years, established itself as the UK’s second-bestselling champagne brand after the near-ubiquitous Moët, which sells for almost three times the price, while winning plenty of medals and high critic scores in the process. Mimo Moutinho Portuguese Arinto, Vinho Verde, Portugal 2021 (£6.49, Aldi) Having tasted the Veuve Monsigny recently, I’m not going to deny that it’s still remarkable value for a champagne: while not having the full patisserie shop depth of some of my favourite non-vintage wines, it does have a crisp-apple briskness that is very appealing. Still, if I was really after a sparkling Easter bargain in the Aldi range, a wine that punches far above its weight but doesn’t have the cachet (or extra expense) of the champagne appellation on the label, I’d go for another of the discounter’s hardy fizz perennials, the creamy Specially Selected Crémant du Jura 2019 or the raspberry ripple-scented Crémant de Limoux Rosé NV (both £8.49). Beyond the fizz, Aldi still excels at finding drinkable bottles at prices where the drinkability threshold isn’t always met: at £3.99, Estevez Chilean Pinot Noir is a charming, subtly earthy, floral light red. But my favourites tend to be in the bracket a couple of quid higher: dry white newcomer Mimo Moutinho, for example, is a mouthwatering spritz of citrus and tropical fruit. Athlon Greek Agiorgitiko, Peloponnese, Greece 2018 (£7.49, Aldi) As I tasted my way through more than 100 Aldi wines at the retailer’s recent press tasting, I began to muse on the difference between eclectic and random, which, I suppose, are really just positive and negative words for the same phenomenon. Aldi’s wine range flits between the two, making browsing the wine shelves a similar experience to dipping into the retailer’s famous middle aisle: there’s a distinct, hectic (and no doubt cultivated) back-of-a-lorry vibe to some of the choices, but there are definitely worthwhile things to be found. Curiously, many of the more expensive bottles – the perfectly OK oaky rioja-alike Charosa Vineyards Indian Tempranillo Reserve 2016 and the acceptable Chinese Bordeaux facsimile Wild Pony Chinese Red 2018 (both £14.99) – are from up-and-coming regions on which many wine drinkers would, I imagine, be reluctant to splash the extra cash. But the respective £6.99 and £7.49 price tags seem more than reasonable for my two new favourite canny own-label buys: the citrus-grove fragrant white Aspri Petra Greek Assyrtiko 2021 and the savoury, tangy-plummy red Athlon Agiorgitiko.
