1/31/2022,"February is set to be nothing short of a prolific month! The month kicks off with a New Moon in Aquarius ushering in the energy of new beginnings and change, and just one day later, we get to experience what some are calling the first of the last three 222 days of the century, occurring on February 2, 2022, February 20, 2022 and February 22, 2022. Yep, you read that correctly. This is the end of a 222 sequence that started back in 2000, with other key years of 2002, 2020 and 2022. We won’t see this sequence again until 2/2/2222—but what’s the significance, anyway? In numerology, the 222 sequence of numbers are often referred to as Angel Numbers. Also, the number 2 in numerology references the energy of duality, partnership, relationship and balance. The key lessons when dealing with the number 2 are generally centered around compromise, acceptance, compassion, cooperation and harmony.

Your February Horoscope Has You Reaching For The Stars Aries, Your February Horoscope Is Expanding Your Social Circle When 2 is in sequence like it is in 222, this energy is super-charged. There is a call to approach life with more compassion, to seek better balance, to work cooperatively with others, to seek partnership when you can and strive for harmony. When you think about the last almost 22 years, don’t so many of these themes ring true? This is especially profound when you think about 2020! There is no way we could have made it through the last two years without compassion and cooperation. So much of our world has changed, especially the ways in which we interact with others. Click here to read the full article. What’s more, the United States has it’s very first Pluto Return on 2/20/2022 coinciding with the second 222 day of the month. Since America is a relatively young country, it has never experienced the return of Pluto or the start of a new Pluto cycle. For your reference, when Pluto—the lord of destruction, transformation and power—makes a return (which takes approximately 247 years) that entity (in this case, the US) has an opportunity to let go of archaic systems and structures that no longer benefit the masses, so that every individual associated with that entity gets to maximize the potential of their soul. If we look to older countries for some insight, it’s very easy to deduce that major power shifts occurred during that time. Pluto Returns in France and Russia marked the deaths of Napoleon and Stalin. Spanish dictator Francisco Franco relinquished power during Spain’s last Pluto Return. Some even argue that the UK’s last Pluto Return coincides with their unofficial fall from world leader status. Historically, this time is marked with a lot of change and most believe that for the US that will be no different. Fortunately, the good thing about change and transformation is, well, change and transformation. As painful as it might be to see failure, it is incredibly powerful to be able to see potential. This is what makes the 222 days so profound! 222 days serve as a reminder for us to know that, no matter what happens in our world, we are in a time of cooperation, compassion, duality and harmony—if we so choose to embody these qualities. So, hopefully you choose to use the last days of this magical 222 energy like a portal to channel all the love and hope you can. For yourself first, and then for others.

1/31/2022,"An off-duty correction officer shot a pair of armed robbers in the Bronx after he was lured into meeting up by a woman promising him a date, police sources said. The correction officer thought he was meeting 21-year-old Diamond Sanchez for a date about 6 p.m. Saturday — but she had other plans for him, the sources said. Police did not release the name of the correction officer, who’s in his 20s, and could not say if he worked for the city or state. The correction officer and Sanchez were sitting in a car at E. 183rd St. and Tiebout St. in Fordham Heights, when two men, Christopher Santana, 22, and Leonel Cuevas, 26, walked up to them, the sources said. One of the duo pulled out a gun and demanded the correction officer’s belongings but the victim was armed as well, opening fire from inside the vehicle, the sources said. The correction officer shot Cuevas multiple times in the chest and blasted Santana in the stomach, back and hip. Medics took both men to St. Barnabas Hospital, where Cuevas is in critical condition. Santana is in stable condition, police said. One of the duo dropped their gun and Sanchez tried to hide it, police sources said. All three are charged with robbery and criminal possession of a weapon while Sanchez is also charged with tampering with evidence. The correction officer is not expected to face any charges, police sources said.",U.S./NY Daily News,Off-duty correction officer shoots armed Bronx robbers after he’s lured by woman with promise of date,https://news.yahoo.com/off-duty-correction-officer-shoots-173000575.html
1/31/2022,"DENVER (AP) — A fire raging in an underground Colorado coal field in 1883 sent so much smoke pouring from cracks in the ground that the scene was likened to burning volcanoes and the state's first mining inspector deemed the blaze “impossible to extinguish.” Nearly 140 years later two fires still smolder in the now-abandoned coal field near Boulder — the same area where a wildfire last month destroyed more than 1,000 homes and buildings and killed at least one person. It’s still unknown what caused the December blaze that became the most destructive in Colorado history, but Boulder County authorities have said they're investigating the area’s abandoned coal mines as one of several possible causes, along with power lines, human activity and other possibilities. Could smoldering coal have started such a fire? History shows the answer is yes, with at least two Colorado blazes in the past 20 years blamed on mine fires that spread to the surface. And in Montana this past summer slow-burning coal reserves fanned by winds sparked a pair of blazes that burned a combined 267 square miles (691 square kilometers) on and around the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation. Across the U.S. at least 259 underground mine fires burned in more than a dozen states as of last September, according to federal Office of Surface Mining data. There are hundreds and possibly thousands more undocumented blazes burning in coal seams that have never been mined, researchers and government officials say. Globally, such fires are also a problem, including in India, Australia and South Africa. In China, the world’s largest coal producer, an estimated 10 million to 200 million tons of the fuel annually burn or are left inaccessible by fires, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. As climate change leads to drought across larges swaths of a U.S. West already seeing longer and more destructive fire seasons, experts say smoldering coal fires will pose a continuing threat. Such fires can be ignited by lightning, humans and even spontaneously at temperatures as low as 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius), said Jurgen Brune a Colorado School of Mines engineering professor. Many are impossible to put out, slowly burning underground as the combustion feeds off a small amount of oxygen present in the coal, he said. “Covering it up and trying to take away the oxygen from the fire puts out most fires. Not for coal fires,” Brune said. Underground coal seams burn unpredictably and can break through to the surface without warning long after a fire starts, he said. “It’s like trying to predict an earthquake,” Brune said. “With all the technology we have today they are not coming any closer to predicting them. The same goes for a coal fire.” The fires emit toxic mercury and the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, and cause sinkholes when the ground’s surface collapses into burned cavities below. In Centralia, Pennsylvania, the fumes and subsidence from a coal fire that started beneath the town in 1962 got so bad that more than 1,000 people eventually relocated at a cost of $42 million. The estimated future cost to control the 200 known abandoned mine blazes across the U.S. is almost $900 million, according to the Office of Surface Mining database. In the wake of last summer's fires, local officials in Montana plan to map out burning seams across the state's southeast in coming months using a federal grant. Controlling them will be difficult and could cost a minimum of $300,000 per site, said Bobbi Vannattan with the Rosebud Conservation District, which is helping to coordinate the mapping. “The problem with coal seam fires is we don’t know how deep they are or how wide they are until you get in there and start digging,” she said. In Colorado, officials were monitoring at least 38 underground coal fires as of 2019. Boulder County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Carrie Haverfield declined to specify which mines were being investigated in relation to the Dec. 30 blaze or what prompted authorities’ interest, which was first reported by KUSA-TV. At least three efforts were made by authorities to quench or reduce damage from the blaze the state mine inspector first encountered more than a century ago at the abandoned Marshall Mine, located on park land in the vicinity of where investigators believe the recent fire started. The first came in 1982, when federal officials drilled into the ground to investigate how far the fire extended and later sought to smother it with a 2-foot (60-centimeter) layer of dirt, according to a U.S. Geological Survey report. In 2005, a small brush fire was traced back to a hot vent from the fire. Crews from Boulder removed vegetation in the area and federal officials tried to fill the vent and others with rocks to try to protect against another fire, according to the Office of Surface Mining. In 2016, after federal officials said the state had taken control of the site, workers excavated and filled in two areas where ground had subsided after fire consumed the underground coal. When the site was visited two years later by workers for a state contractor, Tetra Tech, they found no evidence of fire — no melting snow, no smoky odors. The company recommended annual monitoring of the site because of its past erratic behavior but no new steps to abate the potential hazard. “The fire’s activity is very low and thus presents little potential to start a surface fire,” Tetra Tech wrote in a 2019 report prepared for the Colorado Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety. Generally the responsibility of monitoring coal mine fires falls to the property owner, according to the Colorado Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety. The Marshall Mine fire sits under an open space park owned by the city of Boulder near a state highway. Boulder officials said they don't have responsibility to do work on the fire. However, the city is required to notify the state if rangers or trail crews at the popular hiking area see smoke or shifts, city spokesperson Sarah Huntley said. The state’s mining division said it was not notified of any changes at the mine fire since the 2019 report. The state receives federal funding to help property owners monitor or mitigate abandoned coal mine fires. But the mining division cannot require any work be done at the sites, spokesperson Chris Arend said. ___ Brown reported from Billings, Montana.",U.S./Associated Press,Deadly Colorado blaze renews focus on underground coal fires,https://news.yahoo.com/deadly-colorado-blaze-renews-focus-162040477.html
1/31/2022,"NORTH LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) — A six-vehicle crash killed nine people and left one person in critical condition in Nevada, and police are trying to determine if a driver was impaired before running a red light, causing the collision. Las Vegas police said the driver and a passenger were among the dead after Saturday’s crash and the ages of the other victims ranged from juveniles to middle-aged adults. A Nevada intersection remained closed Sunday as authorities investigated. Two people were taken to a hospital where one died and the other was in critical condition, according to North Las Vegas police. They said the identities of the driver and the other eight people killed would be released by the Clark County coroner’s office. In all, 15 people were involved in the crash. “We have not seen a mass casualty traffic collision like this before,” police spokesman Alexander Cuevas said at a news conference. Cuevas said the crash was reported at 3 p.m. after the driver struck multiple vehicles, causing “a chaotic event.” Some of the vehicles struck were pushed into a vacant lot on the intersection. “Our thoughts and our prayers are with the families who are experiencing a tremendous and unnecessary loss due to a careless and senseless act,” North Las Vegas Councilwoman Pamela Goynes-Brown said. “Please make this a safer community by slowing down. Pay attention to speed limits,” Cuevas said. On Jan. 10, another six-vehicle crash just south of Las Vegas left four people dead. According to authorities, 2021 was the deadliest on Nevada roads in 14 years. The state reported 382 traffic fatalities last year, an 18% increase over 2020's total.",U.S./Associated Press,"9 killed, 1 critically injured in North Las Vegas crash",https://news.yahoo.com/9-killed-1-critically-injured-091905330.html
