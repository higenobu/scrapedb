1/21/2022,"Hundreds of people have been stripped of their British citizenship in the last 15 years, according to research, including one man who was stateless for almost five years. Research carried out by Free Movement, a website run by lawyers to provide information for those affected by immigration control, has found that at least 464 people have had their citizenship removed since the law permitting this practice was relaxed 15 years ago.  The government does not routinely publish the total number of people it strips of British citizenship. CJ McKinney, of Free Movement, said the lack of figures from the Home Office was frustrating: “This is an extremely serious punishment that amounts to being banished from the UK in many cases. Saying how often existing citizenship deprivation powers are used is the bare minimum of transparency that parliament and the public should expect.” One of the most well known cases is that of Shamima Begum, who was deprived of her citizenship after leaving the UK as a 15-year-old schoolgirl to join Islamic State, and lost her battle to have it restored in February 2021. McKinney found that since 2006, 175 people have been deprived of their citizenship on national security grounds, and 289 because of fraud. Prior to 2006 the power had not been used since 1973. McKinney said he compiled the information from historic freedom of information requests and “obscure statistical publications”. A power to deprive someone of British citizenship goes back to 1914 but in recent years the legal test about when it can be used has been watered down. Between 2006 and 2010 there were nine cases, according to freedom of information data. But by 2017 numbers had peaked at 148 people who had their citizenship removed that year. In 2018 there were 73 cases, in 2019 82 cases, and in 2020 42 cases. In one case revealed by the Observer this week, a 40-year-old man, referred to only as E3, was stripped of his British citizenship in 2017. He was born in London to parents of Bangladeshi heritage, but had his citizenship removed when he flew to Bangladesh. He was told he was an “Islamist extremist who had previously sought to travel abroad to participate in terrorism-related activity”. He has never been arrested or questioned in relation to these claims, nor has he been provided with any evidence which substantiates these claims. His citizenship was reinstated after the Home Office accepted he is stateless as a result of having his British citizenship taken away from him. The case highlights the human cost of this power that the Home Office hopes to further strengthen in its controversial nationality and borders bill, which will no longer require notice to be given before taking away someone’s British citizenship. The man’s lawyer, Fahad Ansari of Duncan Lewis solicitors, said: “Depriving people of their citizenship means stripping away their identity, their sense of belonging and their ability to seek protection. As such, it is wrong in principle. That injustice is only compounded when it is carried out without any prior judicial oversight and based on secret evidence which the individual and his lawyers will never see. “Rather than further strengthening the home secretary’s powers by removing the requirement to give notice, the government should be scrapping the deprivation power altogether.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The Home Office is committed to publishing its transparency report into the use of disruptive powers and will do so in due course. “Removing British citizenship has been possible for over a century, and is used against those who have acquired citizenship by fraud, and against the most dangerous people, such as terrorists, extremists and serious organised criminals.”",News/UK news,"Hundreds stripped of British citizenship in last 15 years, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/21/hundreds-stripped-british-citizenship-last-15-years-study-finds
1/21/2022,"Nigel Jones is no stranger to emergency situations. After nearly 11 years in the Royal Signals, followed by 24 years in the fire service, Jones, from Penperlleni in Monmouthshire, now works as a full-time emergency medical technician with the Welsh ambulance service. Alongside the day job, his passion for volunteering has seen him join forces with charities such as SSAFA (the armed forces charity), the Fire Fighters Charity and mountain rescue. Two-and-a-half years ago, he began offering his help as an international responder to Re:Act Disaster Response, a charity that deploys military veterans to emergency situations where their hard-earned skills often prove invaluable.  In February 2021, Re:Act sent Jones to Australia for a month as part of a team of six to help provide urgent relief during the bushfire crisis. It meant he returned to the UK just as another large-scale emergency – the Covid-19 pandemic – was beginning to take hold. “Being in the ambulance service, it was quite full-on,” he says of the early days of the pandemic. “During the first wave, pretty much every patient we took in the ambulance was Covid-related.” Seeing first-hand the gravity of the situation, Jones didn’t hesitate to offer his assistance to Re:Act on UK soil, too. “I couldn’t sit around not doing anything,” he says of the decision to give up his days off. It meant Jones was involved in several crucial projects in response to the pandemic in Wales, including helping to build Cardiff and Bridgend’s Nightingale hospitals. “Re:Act have access to incredible ex-military staff who have a wide range of specialist skills, from logistics to communications and transport, so the knowledge and skillset needed is already there,” he says. The Covid-19 response by Re:Act has been impressive. So far, the charity has helped provide 8,406 Covid response volunteers to emergency situations and has supported around 106,500 vaccinations. During the first wave of Covid-19, volunteers such as Jones primarily worked to support PPE distribution, as well as helping with emergency food provision, welfare checks for those shielding and even mortuary assistance, as well as helping local authorities. Since then, efforts have shifted to focus on supporting the NHS with hospital and ambulance decontamination, non-clinical tasks, and supporting NHS vaccination and testing sites. Jones’s latest volunteering role saw him stationed at a pop-up vaccination centre in Hereford. “Going into the Omicron wave, I realised vaccinations were probably the only way out of this,” he says. “So when Re:Act asked if anybody could help, I thought: ‘Yes, absolutely – because if we even get five people vaccinated, that’s five people who aren’t going to suffer.’ “The skills of ex-military personnel are so transferable,” he says. “In the military – and the emergency services too – there’s not a lot that comes across our path that bamboozles us. We can always find a way around things. We learn essential life skills – and crucial people skills – that are invaluable in emergency situations like this.” Stationed at the vaccination centre in January, Jones helped ensure that as many people as possible were able to receive their Covid-19 booster vaccine in the local area, as well as those who had decided to take up their first or second vaccinations. “Our role was to facilitate paperwork and take people from one place to another, ensuring they were OK and reassuring them so the nurses could get on and do the vaccinations. The whole team worked seamlessly together,” he says. “By the end of one day, we’d given about 120 vaccinations, ranging from schoolchildren to pensioners.” Those having their first vaccinations were welcomed with open arms, he adds. “I actually asked somebody having their first jab: ‘What changed your mind then?’ and he said: ‘Omicron, because it’s more infectious.’ I just said: ‘Well done for coming, it will be really beneficial to you’ – it’s not our job to judge people.” Jones’s role with the ambulance service means he is a firm supporter of the vaccination rollout. “In this Omicron wave, I’ve only taken one person [with Covid] to hospital in my ambulance in the last two months,” he says. “The hospital we drive into is split into two parts – Covid and non-Covid arrivals – and I can see that overall we’re not taking as many people into the Covid zone. Previously, every single ambulance had a Covid case on it. People are still presenting because they’ve got symptoms, of course, but they’re nowhere near as bad – that is all down to the vaccination. So, from my point of view, the vaccinations work and I encourage people to have them. I think people tend to listen to me because of what I do, perhaps.” The memory of transporting those seriously ill with the virus will stay with him for a long time, he says. “The gravity of the situation was really visible when you saw unwell people in the back of the ambulance. They were struggling to breathe, looked really ill and had all the signs and symptoms like the cough and a high temperature. Now we’re just not seeing that at all. “I’m not saying the virus isn’t there – it is, it’s just that because people have been vaccinated, it’s not putting them into hospital as regularly. While I’d never strong-arm people into being vaccinated, I do tell them I’m seeing less people going to hospital because of the vaccinations, which you can’t really argue with.” Jones, who was vaccinated early in the process, has not caught the Covid-19 virus himself. “It’s unbelievable,” he laughs. “It’s an ongoing joke with my wife and my colleagues now. There are usually two of us working on the ambulance – myself and my colleague – and we always work very closely together and with the people who come on to the ambulance. We were working on the same ambulance when he caught Covid, and – though I was testing regularly – I just never got it. I kept doing lateral flow tests expecting to see two lines and I never did. When I tell people this and explain I was fully vaccinated, I think it helps reassure them that the vaccinations really do work.” The furore over injections is something of a storm in a teacup to the military veteran, who has been stationed around the world in Kenya, Oman, Cyprus, France and Northern Ireland, for example. “I did just over 10-and-a-half years in the army and every time you go to a different country, you’re told: ‘Go to the medical centre,’ and you get jabbed with all sorts. So the fact it’s a new vaccination didn’t matter to me,” he says. “I’ve had 41 years now in uniform – with the army, fire and ambulance service and it has given me a sense of perspective. Certain things that people moan about aren’t really that important, I suppose.” For now, Jones is continuing to lend his support to Re:Act’s Covid-19 efforts and shows no signs of slowing down. “A lot of veterans join Re:Act because they leave the military and are at a low ebb. I think they lose the sense of comradeship, purpose and structure they once had, and I understand that. “I’m 57 years old now and working full-time, but whether I get to deploy internationally again, I don’t know. Volunteering and helping people is just something I’ve always done and really enjoy – I’ll keep doing it as long as I can.” This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

1/21/2022,"It was an ordinary Tuesday at the office – and the day everything changed. We had breakfasted in a time of optimism, inside and outside the Guardian. The lustre was yet to fade from a Labour party that had recently been elected for a second term, while the internet was bringing the world to our doors. I was the literary editor. Come lunchtime, a group of us headed out to celebrate a new partnership with the Hay festival, which the previous year had been declared “the Woodstock of the mind” by Bill Clinton. It was all very jolly and perhaps a bit smug – part of a mission to seize the literary high ground.  Halfway through the main course, a waiter appeared, asking if there was an Ed Pilkington at the table, because there was a phone call for him. This wasn’t entirely surprising, as Ed was the foreign editor, which has never been a job of the long lunch. When he returned, ruffling his hair, a bemused look on his face, he said he had to go back to the office because a plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. Ha ha, someone joked. If you need an exit line, you might as well choose a good one. Minutes later, the waiter was back again, asking if there was a Gary Younge in our party. Gary, at that time a columnist and features writer, returned with a stunned looked on his face. “I need a taxi home to get my passport,” he said. “I’m on the next plane to New York.” It was as if we had walked through a wormhole separating before from after. Around us, diners chatted on happily, stuck in the before, while we abandoned our lunch and hurried into the after. The office was in a state of hushed pandemonium. It was truly shocking, a glimpse of a tragedy that, even in those first minutes, you knew would unfold over decades. Staff clustered in appalled silence around TV screens – which were already playing the same image again and again, showing a passenger plane crashing into a tower in the morning sun – while editors tore up their plans and got to work on the first edition of the new era. Gary never did catch that plane to New York (the closure of US airspace meant he had to go the long way round, via the Caribbean), but I have never felt so awe-struck by my colleagues’ ability to rise to a crisis, and so humbled by the responsibility of finding words capable of giving shape to a horrific event that hours earlier had been beyond imagination.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Memories of office life: on 9/11, we walked through a wormhole separating before from after",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/21/memories-of-office-life-on-911-we-walked-through-a-wormhole-separating-before-from-after
1/21/2022,"Ireland is set to emerge from one of the longest and strictest coronavirus policies in Europe with virtually all Covid restrictions to be lifted in the coming weeks. The taoiseach will set out the precise details in a national address on Friday evening but It is expected the 8pm curfew on hospitality, imposed in December to combat the spread of the Omicron variant, will be lifted as early as next Wednesday.  Other restrictions on the number of households that can gather together, limits on the numbers that can attend sporting events or weddings are also expected to go next week. A requirement for vaccine certificates at restaurants and bars is expected to be lifted, but maintained for international travel. Mask wearing is also expected to be maintained in shops and public transport and the return of workers to the office phased in to give employers time to prepare. The cabinet will meet at 3pm on Friday to finalise the timetable for changes but the way was cleared for freedoms to be restored after National Public Health Emergency Team said it was supportive of the relaxations. With Omicron infections declining and hospital numbers stabilising, there was a palpable sense of optimism across the airwaves on Friday. Some have expressed surprise about the pace of change after two years in which 6,000 Covid-related deaths were recorded, with tourism hammered and countless businesses closing. The removal of restrictions will be a relief for many pubs and restaurants hammered by the 8pm curfew imposed at Christmas, but too late for those that did not survive the earlier 20-month-long restrictions on hospitality that were only lifted in October 2021. Danny McCoy, the chief executive of Ibec, Ireland’s business representative group, welcomed the news as a “positive development”, while Ryanair has announced a record number of services from Ireland.

1/21/2022,"My Bloody Valentine have criticised Spotify for showing “fake lyrics” to the shoegaze band’s famously cryptic songs. In November 2021, Spotify launched a feature allowing users to read along to the lyrics while they listen to any song.  “Just noticed that Spotify has put fake lyrics up for our songs without our knowledge,” the band tweeted. “These lyrics are actually completely incorrect and insulting. We’re not sure where they got them from, probably one of those bullshit lyrics sites on the internet.” The offending lyrics appear to have been removed from Spotify as of 21 January but they remain on Musixmatch, the site Spotify partnered with for lyrics integration. My Bloody Valentine were holdouts to the world of streaming, finally uploading their catalogue in March 2021 when they signed to Domino Records. The British group, led by Kevin Shields, has famously never clarified the largely inaudible lyrics to their songs, even within the liner notes of their own records, a mystery that has added to the group’s mythology. In 1990, Shields teased NME with the fact that the lyrics were often “pretty sensual”. “It’s not hard, industrial music or anything like that. It’s very human. People who experience the pleasure of any sexual thing will find something there, I think. Our lyrics are quite explicit occasionally but it’s all real. There’s nothing there that ordinary people don’t say to each other when they’re alone.” They tended to emerge from his subconscious, Shields told Melody Maker in 1990. “When you know you really have to do it, you just forget everything and you do it. If you try to be clever and wordy, unless you’re really clever, the chances are you’ll fall flat your face. If you just write whatever’s in your head at the time, it’s your subconscious. Your conscious – mine, anyways – doesn’t know what’s going on.” An earlier, indie-pop incarnation of the band had been more focused on writing “perfect pop songs with sick lyrics”, as an NME journalist wrote in 1988. That was down to original vocalist David Conway – now a published science fiction novelist – Shields explained. “The idea of composing a sweet pop song that sugar-coated some lyrical horror and sending it hurtling up the charts appealed to our sense of humour. Also it was fresh after having made pure noise earlier. “Once we’d mastered the art of writing snappy pop songs with our eyes and ears closed the whole project started to become boring as hell,” Shields said. Conway departed the band, which lost its inclination towards pop, they signed to Creation Records and returned to their noisy roots, producing the era-defining albums Isn’t Anything (1988) and Loveless (1991). Even the label remained in the dark about the band’s true lyrical content. In 1991, Shields told the late music journalist David Cavanagh that he wouldn’t even write out the precise lyrics for the group’s music publishers. “I give them the titles,” he said. “Then a girl at Creation [Records] listens to the songs and writes down what she thinks I’m singing. And that’s what she gives them. They’re actually more her lyrics than mine. And some of the discrepancies are hilarious.” The rise of lyric sites online led to a lot of amateur guesswork at the content of Shields’ lyrics. In 2021, he told the Guardian that “30-50%” of those guesses are “completely wrong, sometimes in really key areas”. “Part of me really likes the folk song element of that – people changing things, having their own version of reality – and part of me thinks I should go through them like a teacher, correcting them.” My Bloody Valentine released their long-awaited third album, mbv, in 2013. Shields has promised a follow-up this year – but fans may know better than to hold their breath.",Arts/Music,My Bloody Valentine criticise Spotify for showing ‘fake’ lyrics to their songs,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/21/my-bloody-valentine-criticise-spotify-for-showing-fake-lyrics-to-their-songs
1/21/2022,"Aslew of sexual violence and drugging allegations prompted officials at the University of Southern California to shut down all fraternity parties last fall. Now the parties are back on – but with new rules.  Security guards will be stationed on stairways and in public areas, risk and sexual violence prevention trainings will be mandatory for members and chapters will have to complete compliance reviews before and after all gatherings when they resume in March, according to details outlined in an action plan this week. The new policies, put together by a fraternity-led committee that includes faculty, student government leaders and university officials, came about after more than a dozen students confidentially reported to the university that their drinks had been drugged or that they had been sexually assaulted. Six of the reports were linked to the Sigma Nu fraternity house, which pledged full cooperation with investigations in a statement issued last fall and suspended its chapter president. Protests erupted in the following weeks as students and teachers demanded accountability, and school officials promised they would deliver. But advocates are concerned the new policies will do little to change the underlying toxic culture that has persisted for decades. Some say the security solutions do more to placate parents’ perceptions than to solve core problems. “There is a history with this university of not protecting its students when it comes to sexual assault,” says Natalia Parraz, a USC senior and president of a student-led intersectional feminism organization called USC flow, which led demonstrations. She sees the plan as a “quick fix to a very systemic problem” and voiced frustration that recommendations from her group, including community-led discussions, were absent from the plan. Parraz is concerned that the university has prioritized PR over prevention. USC has relied on hired security observers to assuage safety concerns before, and fraternities are already required to have security guards on hand during events. Meanwhile, trainings about consent and sexual assault, though not mandatory, are already provided, and “obviously aren’t working”, she says. Warnings about the risks of attending fraternity parties at USC have long been passed down through students. It became common knowledge never to leave a drink unattended and female party-goers often exercised the buddy-system to ensure they got home safely. A third of female undergraduates at USC said they had been victims of sexual assault according to a survey done in 2019 by the Association of American Universities. That’s higher than the already astounding national average of one in four female students and 23% of transgender, genderqueer, or non-binary college students who have reportedly been sexually assaulted, according to statistics compiled by Rainn, an anti-sexual violence organization. But the university has resisted shutting down its fraternities, which are a big part of the school’s social scene. Roughly 4,000 USC students are affiliated with Greek life and the organizations are also considered important for providing opportunities for philanthropy, leadership and post-graduate networking. “The Greek community serves an important role in many of our students’ sense of belonging,” the Interfraternity Council working group wrote in a statement detailing the plan, adding that “it is clear that social environments within the IFC community require enhanced attention to safety planning and risk prevention”. The IFC, which serves as the governing board of fraternities at the university, did not respond to a request for comment. But in a previously issued statement the group expressed disgust for the “violence that took place in our community” and said it was “deeply apologetic for the trauma caused and impact on victims and the University of Southern California community as a whole”. The university has placed four IFC fraternities on interim suspension and a fifth is still under investigation, but others will be able to resume social activities next month if they are found to be in compliance with the new rules. Laura Palumbo, a spokesperson for the non-profit National Sexual Violence Resource Center, says that institutions must be committed to change the culture and not just the policies. “Often with fraternities there is a focus on risk management and security concerns, and it’s equally important to be thinking about how to positively shape the environment to promote respect and healthy behaviors,” she says. “Long standing fraternity or campus cultures that normalize and dismiss sexual abuse cannot be changed overnight.” USC claims to be in it for the long-haul. “The recommendations made by the university’s IFC Culture, Prevention and Accountability Working Group are part of a preliminary action plan,” a university spokesperson said in a statement to the Guardian, noting that a report will be issued at the end of the semester. “The group’s focus now shifts to exploring long-term strategies for improving culture, enhancing accountability, and addressing systemic challenges within IFC chapters.” Parraz, the student advocate, says she hopes their voices will be considered and included going forward. “We are trying to give advice on the preventative measures and they are not really listening,” she says. “The sad fact is that this conversation has happened every two to four years on campus.”",News/US news,USC is resuming frat parties after abuse claims - with guards at the door,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/21/usc-resuming-frat-parties-abuse-claims-guards-door
1/21/2022,"New York’s new mayor gets his first paycheck on Friday – and as part of his bid to keep the city “on the forefront of innovation”, he’ll be receiving his wages in cryptocurrency.  “New York is the center of the world and we want it to be the center of cryptocurrency and other financial innovations,” Eric Adams said in a press release. But even in the center of the world, trying to live on ethereum or bitcoin might be a struggle. The subway won’t take it, and it’s hard to fit dogecoin in the quarter slot at the laundromat. So what will Adams actually be able to do with his paycheck? Will he be able to eat? Yes. Getting groceries might be difficult - in 2019, Whole Foods began accepting cryptocurrency via an app-based payment system called Flexa, but a customer care representative said on Thursday that the company was not currently taking cryptocurrency. But the vegan mayor might have better luck at restaurants. Yelp allows users to filter for restaurants that accept cryptocurrency – though calls to the spots and visits to their websites suggest some of the claims are inaccurate. He could also use a workaround and purchase a gift card with bitcoin using one of various platforms such as Bitrefill and Fold. That could get him a coffee at Starbucks or an order through DoorDash; it also works for Amazon, Netflix and other companies. (Adams’ cryptocurrency paycheck is itself the result of a workaround, since department of labor regulations require the city of New York to pay employees in dollars. The mayor’s office says the paycheck will “automatically be converted” to cryptocurrency before it is made available to him, using the platform Coinbase.) That means that Adams’ paycheck must first be converted from dollars to cryptocurrency, then be converted to a gift card, and finally be used to buy a smoothie. Efficient! Another trick: he could turn to PayPal, which lets users spend cryptocurrency for transactions (Mastercard has a similar program). But the app first converts the cryptocurrency to actual dollars – creating another pointless cycle and contributing to a system that, according to Cambridge researchers, uses more electricity per year than the country of Argentina. Will he be able to keep the lights on? Probably not without turning to his actual bank account. Con Edison, New York’s enormous electricity and gas utility, does not accept cryptocurrency payments, a representative said. Cryptocurrency does a great job of draining the world of energy, but using it to buy some back appears difficult. Of course, he’ll be living in Gracie Mansion, the New York mayor’s residence – meaning, presumably, he won’t be paying these bills anyway. Nor will he have to worry about whether his landlord accepts bitcoin. Will he be able to get anywhere? Not if he wants to take the subway like a normal New Yorker or any other transportation provided by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The MTA doesn’t accept cryptocurrency, a spokesperson said. If he gets stuck, Adams might be able to hail an Uber using his paycheck, but it could be a long wait at the corner. Uber’s CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, indicated in February that he was open to accepting bitcoin in the future, but when is unclear. In the meantime, he could buy an Uber gift card. Will he be able to use the very internet that cryptocurrency depends on? Again, he could have trouble. Verizon Fios, New York’s biggest internet provider, does not appear to offer a cryptocurrency option for online payments. Adams may find himself turning to his pre-mayoral savings if he wants to check the price of bitcoin. So what will he actually do? Adams’ office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But he may well just “hold on to it as an investment”, says Neeraj Agrawal, communications director at Coin Center, a non-profit focused on cryptocurrency policy. “That has become the more common use of bitcoin these days.” Or, if he’s feeling really financially innovative, he could go totally virtual: it won’t get him a ride on the subway, but he could buy the word “MetroCard” as an NFT for the equivalent of about $30.",News/US news,New York City’s mayor is getting paid in cryptocurrency.

1/21/2022,"Abba have reached a settlement with a tribute band they described in a lawsuit as “parasitic and bad faith”. Lawyers for Abba filed the lawsuit in December, arguing that the British group Abba Mania could be confused with the original act. They said they had asked Abba Mania to change their name but the quartet had refused.  Terms of the settlement have not been disclosed, but one of Abba’s lawyers has claimed the tribute artists will stop using the Abba name. The Guardian has contacted Abba Mania for comment. Abba Mania formed in 1999 and describe themselves as “the world’s most successful touring Abba show”. They are due to tour France in March and the UK in April, and have previously toured across Europe and the Americas. Since Abba’s split in 1982, the Swedish quartet’s popularity has been buoyed by the success of the Abba Gold compilation and the musical Mamma Mia!, generating a substantial market for tribute shows, also including the likes of Björn Again. The lawsuit was filed shortly after the announcement that Abba were themselves returning to the live stage – or, at least, a motion-captured digital version of the group. The concert experience Abba Voyage, featuring avatars of the group performing along with a live band at a custom-built arena in east London, begins in May.

No matter your age, gender, sexuality, whether you have health concerns or are as fit as a fiddle, are single, in a couple, throuple, having solo sex or going to an orgy, you can use lube.  It’s especially brilliant for people who experience vaginal dryness – a perfectly normal part of being a woman or vulva-having person that can be down to anything from stress and menopause to the medications you’re taking.

What are the different types of lubes?With so many types and options, where to start? Water-based is the most popular. Kynect (that’s the new name for KY, the brand most synonymous with lube) describes it as “most similar to the body’s natural wetness”. It doesn’t get sticky, is easy to clean up and can be used for everything from touching to penetration. It’s safe to use with most condoms and sex toys. And, if you go for a gentle, paraben-free lube such as Kynect, it doesn’t upset the vagina’s natural pH. Silicone-based is thicker and longer-lasting. It’s often recommended for anal sex (unlike the vagina, the anus doesn’t self-lubricate), but it can’t be used with silicone sex toys as it causes them to degrade. Oil-based had its moment, but you don’t see it around as much these days. It’s not safe for use with condoms because it causes them to break down. What are the benefits of using lube?Look, it just feels really good. It makes everything slip and slide around easily, which leads to a more enjoyable experience all around. Of course, friction can feel good. But it can be painful if you experience vaginal dryness or are having anal sex. Lube gives you an extra layer of comfort, which makes sex more pleasurable and reduces the risk of soreness or tearing. It also makes condoms less likely to break. It’s not just about the physical benefits, though. Using lube during solo and partnered sex can help you relax, get out of your head and focus purely on the sensation (mindful masturbation is a sex trend for a reason). Using lube can help you connect with your partner, strengthen your communication skills, and build trust and intimacy. It’s also a really simple and cheap way to introduce playfulness to your sex life. Something we so often forget is that sex is meant to be fun! How do you use lube?You can apply it directly on to skin, genitals, nipples, condoms or dental dams. But beware, lube can be very cold. To avoid a potential mood-ruining shock, squeeze it into your hand first and warm it up between your fingers. When using a water-based lube such as Kynect, which is safe for everyday use, you can reapply to your heart’s (and body’s) content. Is lube safe for sensitive skin?Not all lube is created equal. Novelty and cheaper products often contain ingredients that aren’t considered body-safe, ie they’re not great for your skin. Go for water-based lubes such as Kynect, which are gentle and free of parabens, perfume and flavourings. With any new lube, test a drop on a small area first and avoid using it on broken or inflamed skin. Stop using it if you do experience discomfort, and see a doctor if the irritation continues. How do you ask your partner to use lube?We all know communication is the key to great sex, but it’s much easier said than done. Here are some tips: 1 Have any conversations about sex outside of the bedroom. Starting one during sex will likely catch your partner off guard and make them feel vulnerable. 2 Be honest and kind. If you experience vaginal dryness or discomfort, tell your partner. If you’re suggesting lube because you want to try something new, focus on the positives rather than what you think your sex life is “lacking”, or what your partner is doing “wrong”. 3 Ask your partner how they feel – and really listen. 4 Get their full, enthusiastic consent before skipping off to the nearest supermarket arm-in-arm. And finally, remember, using lube really isn’t a big deal. It doesn’t mean you don’t fancy your partner or that there’s anything wrong with you. It just means you’re up for having better, more pleasurable sex. So hats off to you! We’ll see you in the toiletries aisle. You can never have too much of a good thing.

1/21/2022,"“My wife and I have an eight-year-old who never seems to need any sleep, so we don’t have as much ‘alone’ time as we used to. This means that when our daughter is at a club – like gymnastics at 9.30am on a Saturday – we both know that we need to use that time for sex. Because it’s often a bit of a rushed job (we have about 40 minutes before she needs picking up again), there’s not really much time for foreplay, so we rely on Kynect (the new name for KY Jelly) to make things a bit smoother, and it does. It might all seem a bit unromantic, but as with a lot of things in a busy household, you just have to work with what time you have.” Matt, 42 (straight male) “I’ve been married for five years, and my wife and I have a son and a daughter (I gave birth to both of them, but one of them is my egg with a sperm donor and the other is her egg with the same donor). Our sex life is probably the same as a lot of other married couples with kids – pretty sparse! It doesn’t help that for big chunks of time, her parents come over from New Zealand and stay with us, which means we have to move into our son’s room (our daughter goes into a bunk bed with him) and sleep in twin beds. Passion killer. But we always make sure that the last weekend they are with us, they look after the kids overnight and we book into a nice hotel and make up for it.” Gemma, 40 (gay female)  “Tom and I have been together for 18 years and have two girls (14 and eight). We both have busy jobs but have always had a fair bit of sex. I’d say we do it at least twice a week now – something that always gets a shocked response from my other girlfriends with kids – but it used to be way more. Tom would do it every day if he could, but a lot of the time I’m super tired and don’t really feel like it. This is why I make sure I get a regular full wax as I know that really does it for him, and it makes me feel sexy, so helps the whole thing along! Booking a wax is a necessity for me and our intimacy, so the pandemic made things tricky, plus the girls were at home, so the sex did become less frequent. I was very relieved when my waxer could finally make home visits again – and so was Tom.” Holly, 48 (straight female) “I met my boyfriend on a popular gay dating app 11 years ago and we’re now pretty settled. We bought a house together, own a dog and have sex a few times a month. But we also have an open relationship, something that we agreed fairly early on. It stops both of us from feeling trapped and if I’m honest is probably the key to us lasting so long. We don’t talk about our ‘other’ sex lives with each other, I don’t want to think about what he might be doing when I’m away with work or he’s visiting his family in Ireland. But I know it’s happening. Recently I came back from a weekend away and I noticed our tube of lube was out on top of the bedside table, not where we keep it. So I knew he’d probably met up with someone. The important thing is that when we’re together we feel content, connected and very much in love, not itching for the excitement of something else.” David, 43 (gay male)“We’ve been married for 11 years now, together for 14, and after the birth of our daughter (five years ago) sex was pretty non-existent for about a year. We got stuck in a total rut with it. There was never any time, and to be honest I didn’t feel like it. After that, the only time we’d really do it was when I got drunk. A couple of years ago I decided to talk it through with him as I was worried it was becoming a problem. It wasn’t that I didn’t want sex with him anymore, I just felt like we had to go the whole way each time just to tick a box – which then made it feel like a chore. I was honest and told him that I missed kissing and touching and all the foreplay we used to do, when we were young and kid-free. We agreed to concentrate on that. We got a tube of Kynect but agreed only to use it for foreplay and massage. It just makes everything more pleasurable, and soft and slippy. I now don’t feel any pressure to have full-on sex, but all the touching that I get actually makes me want to do it more and we’re now in a much better, more exciting place with our intimacy.” Jen, 39 (straight female) “There’s much more to sex than intercourse and I really realised that when I lost my husband of 42 years to cancer 14 years ago. Quite quickly after his death, I started to have coffees and dinner with one of his old work colleagues, something my family couldn’t understand or accept. But I missed the intimacy of a man’s company over dinner and at the end of the evening, just to talk to. We’ve been ‘together’ ever since. We keep this intimacy alive by having at least three dinners together a week and the last thing we do every night is phone each other to hear each other’s voice. We don’t have actual sexual intercourse, I feel too old for that, and we don’t live together but we go on holiday a few times a year and share a bed and have a cuddle. I don’t think young people understand that talking – and making time for that – can be just as intimate as the other stuff.” Irene, 82 (straight female) “When my fiance and I got engaged recently we hired a photographer to take intimate pictures of us together (we look like we’re having sex in them, but we didn’t actually go the whole way in front of her!) and I love them. They’re so cool and will hopefully remind us both of a time that we couldn’t keep our hands off each other. We’re pretty well matched in that respect even though we’ve now been together for 10 years, and he’s 10 years older than me. But we keep things alive with role play and dirty talk, something that is guaranteed to get us both going.” Charlotte, 29 (straight female) You can never have too much of a good thing.
