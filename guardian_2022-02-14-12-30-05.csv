2/14/2022,"The world’s attention was focused on Australia’s immigration detention regime in January when a wealthy athlete got a court challenge to his detention. Novak Djokovic was ultimately released and sent home, with the court affirming the minister’s decision to cancel his visa because of his stance on Covid vaccines. But still 32 men languish in the Park Hotel, each of them desperate to leave. Australia successfully “stopped the boats”, but it forgot that there were people on those boats whose lives they stopped with them. These same people have been suffering for nearly nine years, unable to move on with their lives, unable to find peace of mind, stability or certainty.  It is a crushing blow to one’s confidence when held in such a position by forces beyond their control. You find you begin to question yourself. Am I really good enough? Do I deserve to have anything good? Am I a human being like everyone else? Even for those of us who have been resettled in the US, due to the infamous “deal” between the Australian government and then US president Barack Obama in 2016, the psychological effects of years of prolonged uncertainty has stayed with every one of us. Even so, I could not imagine what I would be going through right now if I was still on Nauru. Yet this is the reality for the more than 200 still trapped in Australia’s offshore detention regime, those still detained in Australia, and the thousands more who are living in limbo in the community on short-term visas. Detention of refugees indefinitely is a cruelty imposed on innocent people for a political agenda. It is a dog-whistle to the racist elements within Australian society, with the sorry excuse of preventing deaths at sea. We know this because every independent review of Australia’s offshore detention policy has shown it to be one disastrous failure after another, on every level. An ineffective, impractical, extremely expensive, illegal, and deliberately cruel policy. The human and financial cost of this will not be known for decades to come as the medical problems suffered by both detainees and staff manifest themselves and the compensation cases pile up. Put simply, it’s a disaster of huge proportions. Despite the human rights crisis Australia’s offshore detention policy has created, the world is learning the wrong lessons. The UK government is currently debating an indefinite offshore detention bill based on the Australian model. As UK refugee rights advocates and the media have begun examining what that actually looks like, many are walking away shocked and appalled by what they have learned. I hope this will be enough to persuade them that this is not a path they should follow. The issue in Australia and the UK is it’s never been about the policy. It’s simply a strategy used to propel oneself to electoral victory. But nearly nine years on, surely the political utility of this tactic is now approaching its use-by date. We’re talking about real people’s lives, not chips on a poker table. These are people who simply sought safety, and they have been tortured for it. Yet even if the plight of refugees does not move you, even if human rights abuses are not a high priority for you, even if you view international laws and obligations as meaningless and only applicable when it suits you – surely you can still agree that if a country like New Zealand has been offering a solution to this mess, any sane government would take it. The truth is that the New Zealand government has offered to resettle refugees from Australia’s offshore detention regime since 2013, yet the Australian government has still not officially accepted it. How many more people need to lose their lives to this policy? What more will it take? As someone who has experienced Australia’s offshore detention policy first-hand, my message to Australia is simply that it’s time to end it. There are no more excuses left. After nearly nine years, the Australian government needs to let people find safety and move on with their lives. At a minimum, let them go to New Zealand, a country that still observes its international human rights obligations and is ready to accept them with open arms. As a federal election looms, I call on Australian political leaders to end this shameful chapter in Australia’s history and let the healing begin for these refugees, and for Australia as a nation.

2/14/2022,"Even by Super Bowl standards, an event in which the mythologising is as much of a sport as the football, this has been a particularly hyped half-time show. Three weeks before the fact, the NFL released a four-minute trailer, a third as long as the performance itself, which saw Dr Dre, the most important producer in rap history, assemble a superhero cast of 90s hip-hop and R&B legends: Eminem, Mary J Blige and Snoop Dogg as well as Kendrick Lamar, the great west-coast hip-hop talent of his generation, who went to the same Compton high school as Dre. Yet, despite all that pomp, this felt like a different kind of half-time show, directorially and musically it was more inventive than the normal tropes of marching bands and fake fans on the pitch. There was more collaboration and smart interstitial set-pieces, all brought together by Anderson.Paak’s impressive live band. Just before it began, the NBC hosts whispered it might be the greatest super bowl half-time show ever - it wasn’t far off.  It began with Snopp Dogg, in a regal ultramarine blue tracksuit and Dre atop a set built to look like a Compton street (which included a replica of the trailblazing Black architect Harold Williams MLK memorial outside the Compton Civic Centre). They shared a grin of two men reveling in how far they had come as they performed The Next Episode and California Love (although there was no 2Pac hologram to join them for the latter, despite rumors). The camera panned out to reveal a troupe of dancers free-styling across an aerial map of Compton’s streets, and inside the set’s houses, were more dancers and the band playing on couches, a bustling scene. From the roof of one of the houses emerged 50 Cent, recreating his classic 2003 video for In Da Club by performing the song upside down, hanging from the ceiling (plus some enjoyable nightclub choreography reminiscent of every birthday party this song has been played at since its release). There was barely time to catch a breath before Mary J Blige stood atop the set, to sing Family Affair and No More Drama, the camera panning between her powerful rooftop vocals and the party scenes below. She gave way to Kendrick Lamar, emerging with an army of zombie dancers from a series of cardboard boxes to perform Maad City and Alright before Eminem’s set-piece performance of Lose Yourself from 8 Mile. Dre finished with a small tribute to 2Pac, playing the piano riff of I Ain’t Mad At Cha before a moving finale, three generations of artists that Dre mentored, collaborated with and produced, gathered together to watch him perform Still Dre, a song that nods to his unrivaled dominance over west-coast hip-hop. In one telling, this is the redemption moment for the Super Bowl half-time show. After the NFL came under widespread criticism for failing to back players who took the knee. In 2016, Rihanna, Cardi B, Adele and other high-profile artists were reported to have rejected opportunities to perform at the show in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick. The event had to squeeze by with Maroon 5, surely not the top of any bookers list, and questions about its relevance lingered. Since then the production has been taken over by Jay Z’s Roc Nation with acclaimed performers like the Weeknd and a celebrated shared slot between Jennifer Lopez and Shakira returning prestige to the slot. Now with five of the defining artists of 90s hip-hop and R&B sharing a stage, led by Dr Dre who, as part of NWA, gave America’s music its most powerful statement against police racism, it could be argued the Super Bowl has regained some credibility among black fans. The choice of artists was enough for at least one police for, in Long Island, to encourage residents to boycott the ceremony. There were rumors that there would be limits to how much restitution the NFL would allow: reporting in Puck said the NFL had rejected Eminem’s request to take the knee at the ceremony (something they later claimed to be false) and told Dre that he would not be able to include the lyric “still not loving police” in his performance of Still Dre. Yet both those powerful moments did happen. But even they were emotionally overshadowed by Kendrick Lamar emerging from a row of cardboard boxes to perform Alright, the song that was heard at Black Lives Matter performances across the country, now heard at the centerpiece event of a league that had told black athletes five years ago they had no right to protest against racism. The Super Bowl half-time show remains the biggest gig in the world, an unparalleled live TV audience (not for nothing did Mary J Blige, 51, one of the most decorated R&B singers of all time, describe this performance as “the opportunity of a lifetime”.) Yet this year it felt a little more than about great production values and Pepsi sponsorship. You can’t do much in 12 minutes in the gap between a football game, but everything you can do, Dre did. There will be debates that follow about whether all this powerful symbolism is more than glossy gesture politics, but given the brief they had, you can’t imagine them trying any harder to make this mean something.",Arts/Music,"Dr Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Kendrick Lamar and Mary J Blige’s half-time show – an all-timer",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/13/dr-dre-snoop-dogg-eminem-kendrick-lamar-and-mary-j-bliges-half-time-show-an-all-timer
