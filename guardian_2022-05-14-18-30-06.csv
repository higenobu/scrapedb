5/14/2022,"An elderly shires Tory enthused last month: “Boris is the man for the hour! He has delivered Brexit, vaccinations, and now arms for Ukraine. He gets things done!” Having myself only voted Conservative once since 1992, in 2010, I found it tough to embrace this proposition. Yet it is useful to be reminded how many Tory foot soldiers still root for Johnson, even passionately so. Instead of the morally debased figure that many of us recognise, they see simply a prime minister whom they still believe can keep out Labour, the only outcome about which they care a toot. Moreover, they can cause people such as me, long-term residents of the soggy centre, significant embarrassment by demanding whether we sincerely, honestly believe that Keir Starmer or Ed Davey is more fit than Johnson to govern Britain. The damp persuasion cast our votes for Labour or the Liberal Democrats at last week’s local elections to protest against the shocking inadequacy of those in charge. Yet Tory friends are on to a good thing when they urge that it is not enough merely to lay into the present government. We must declare whom we wish instead. Conservatives spotlight the poverty of thinking on the left, conspicuous even among its media columnists. Starmer has earned some modest revival of respect by promising to resign if fined over Beergate. Yet this weak vessel remains in danger of being remembered by posterity as the man who refused to define a woman comprehensibly, and has yet to produce a memorable new policy. Meanwhile the Lib Dems’ Davey is an acceptable backbench MP, but cannot fill big boots. Once again, if we centrists strive for honesty, we should admit doubt that either man would have made a better fist of managing the pandemic or of making policy towards Ukraine than has the current prime minister. Our dilemmas get worse when we contemplate the prospects for Johnson being replaced by another Conservative. Rishi Sunak remains the most impressive alternative, but it seems unlikely that he can overcome the deserved embarrassment over his wife’s tax status, overlaid upon his party’s residual racial prejudice. A northern Tory said to me recently: “Given a choice of two leadership candidates, our local constituency members will never vote for a person of colour.” This is shameful, but his judgment may be correct. The winner of a leadership contest could well be either Ben Wallace or Liz Truss. Both have diminished themselves almost to vanishing point by their wild rhetoric on Ukraine. They talk of its war aims like football supporters baying from the away stands, rather than as respectively our defence and foreign secretaries.Wallace’s remarks this week, likening Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler, reminds us of the unfailing truth that only the most contemptible politicians compare themselves to Churchill, or their enemies to the Nazis. The defence secretary, by his choice of language, debased the discourse to Putin’s own level. Britain is doing the right things by Ukraine, but we should never forget that it is not our people who are fighting and dying. Moreover say what we like about Johnson, he is not a stupid man. Neither Wallace nor Truss seems likely to offer more competent governance, nor to embark upon an adult dialogue with the rest of the world such as Britain has lacked for years, especially with Europe and about Ireland. Jeremy Hunt is by far the best qualified alternative leader, which is why Johnson has never admitted the former health secretary to his cabinet of grotesques. Hunt lacks stardust, but would govern sensibly and tell as much of the truth as any politician can. In less febrile times, these should represent decisive claims on the top job. Unfortunately, however, a Conservative party in bondage to its own right wing is unlikely to defer to Hunt’s virtues. And so, back to Johnson. Thanks to Starmer’s equivocations about his own foolish beer during lockdown, the prime minister may survive even publication of the Sue Gray report on the Downing Street party culture – a much more serious issue than anything allegedly done by the opposition, because the principal instruments of the government repeatedly broke the law that they themselves made. In the eyes of Conservatives, there is still a pragmatic case for retaining Johnson. Yet if the future of Britain and public faith in our politicians are to count for anything, the alternative principled case for removing him must be recognised as imperative. Should he remain prime minister until the general election, a message would go forth to the world and, more importantly, to his prospective successors: that it is no longer cause for disgrace and resignation to have been exposed as a serial liar both in the House of Commons and out of it; that the bar for any man or woman who seeks to govern Britain has been lowered to a moral level that even the basest candidate could surmount. I have suggested that those of Johnson’s Conservative rivals who seem most likely to succeed him are less intelligent people than himself, and no more possessed of new ideas for Britain. Yet if he retains his office, what prospect is there of our country regaining the respect in the eyes of the world that it has assuredly lost, and which cannot be regained merely by a repugnant Tory scramble over the corpses and rubble of Ukraine?In the harsh economic times ahead, Johnson’s inability even to simulate compassion will intensify the government’s unpopularity. An essential quality for any man or woman who aspires to lead Britain through the worst cost of living crisis in modern times will be that they should be seen to be a caring human being. Our body politic must be given an opportunity to do better, however great the uncertainty about what would follow change in Downing Street. For the Tories to flinch from removing Johnson is to invite their devastation at the next general election. Starmer may not be impressive, but by 2024 popular rage against the Tory government could well trump all. For the millions who mill in the middle ground, searching for hope, this can only be discovered in change. The only moral answer to the question “Who else is there?” is: “Anyone but Johnson.” Max Hastings is a former editor of the Daily Telegraph and the Evening Standard",Opinion/Opinion,Who should be prime minister?

5/14/2022,"On Friday, Elon Musk announced he was pausing his $45bn purchase of Twitter because he had only just discovered some of the accounts on the site were fake. But that’s not the strangest thing that has happened to the beleaguered social media platform this week. Because on Tuesday the current top brass, perhaps trying to demonstrate their vision for the site, released a Super Nintendo-style browser game that recaps Twitter’s private policy. The platform unveiled Twitter Data Dash, which plays like a vintage side-scrolling platformer that’s been draped with a healthy dose of disinformation anxiety. You take control of a blue-hued puppy named Data and are tasked with retrieving five bones hidden in each of the game’s day-glo urban environments. (Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was the analog I kept returning to during my gameplay.) After you complete your objective, the level ends and Twitter blesses you with a distilled talking point from its ethics board. Case in point: once I collected my first set of bones, a message popped up on screen informing me that I could opt out of Twitter’s targeted advertisements if I wanted. The second time around, I was given instructions on how to filter my DMs. I get the instincts here. Everyone on the internet has been conditioned to blindly scroll through every terms-of-service agreement we come across, so the idea of condensing some of the finer points into a chibi, interactive browser distraction does make some utilitarian sense. After all, the company has just rewritten its privacy policy and could certainly use some positive PR. But some of the messaging in the game is self-contradictory. In the opening sequence, we are told that Data wants to avoid all of the intrusive “cat ads” in their way. Sure enough, you’ll run into a few felines, brandishing feline-embossed propaganda, which Data must dodge in order to not take damage. But how does that translate to the actual platform? Is Twitter telling me that I should scroll past every ad I see on my timeline? Is it acknowledging that in order to participate on social media, one must be constantly evading the algorithm? “If Twitter actually wanted to be accurate with this level, then you wouldn’t be freely running around a city, dodging bad guys and collecting bones of somewhat questionable origin,” points out the tech site Gizmodo. “Instead, the bad guys are unavoidable, and they’re not only actively piling on top of your poor Data pup and crushing his tiny lungs, but you, the player, need to live with the knowledge that Data will keep on being smothered long after you exit the game.” The more important issue with Twitter Data Dash is that the game isn’t very fun. The controls are too floaty: right now the jump button is mapped to the up arrow, and that’s just crazy. If we must gamify our private policies – if that is the nightmare we must live through – then I demand Elden Ring-like precision. At this point, it’s the least Twitter can do.",News/Technology,Data the dog: Twitter turns its privacy policy into an old-school video game,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/14/twitter-data-dash
5/14/2022,"Energy bills rose in April, and this week there have been more warnings of what could be on the cards later in the year: on Monday the head of Scottish Power said the price cap could go up by £1,000, to just under £3,000 a year. For any household, that represents a huge sum and many are looking at measures that will cut their costs. Research by the Mortgage Advice Bureau found that one in six households intend to get new windows (double or triple glazing), one in seven will be getting more energy efficient fittings and 11% intend to install solar panels. These energy saving fixes are expensive. But there are plenty of small improvements that can be made to homes that will cut your heating bills. Spring is the perfect time to repair and upgrade your home. Warmer weather means sealants will dry quicker, and there are longer days in which to complete tasks. Here’s a guide to some of the most popular DIY measures and improvements that can be easily – and safely – made without expert assistance. Radiator reflector foil reduces heat loss by reflecting warmth back into the room. While you can use ordinary kitchen foil, a 1.2 metre roll of radiator reflector foil is only £1.49 from Toolstation, as part of the store’s clearance sale. It’s very easy to install, too. You just need to measure the distance between the radiator brackets, cut your foil down to fit between them and then slide it into place – making sure that the reflective side faces outwards. You can hold it in place using PVA glue or double-sided sticky tape. Another consideration is the type of paint used on the radiator. Daniel Nezhad, a director of the retailer UK Radiators, says painting your radiator can affect its heat output. He says: “The main relationship between painting your radiator and its efficiency is to do with the type of radiator paint rather than the colour. It has been shown that a radiator coated with metallic paint will emit less heat, under otherwise identical conditions, than a similar radiator coated with non-metallic paint.” Another way to increase the energy efficiency of radiators is to bleed them. This means releasing air trapped inside them, which results in the heat not being distributed as evenly as usual. It’s a quick and simple job. Start by turning your heating on to locate the radiators in your home that need bleeding – these will be the ones that are not heating up properly (the top half will feel colder) or are making gurgling sounds. Next, turn the heating off again and wait for all radiators to cool down completely. You will then need to lay down some old towels underneath the radiators that you’ll be bleeding and maybe a container to catch any water. Find the bleed valve – it’s usually at the top at one end – and use a radiator valve key to loosen it slightly to allow the built-up air to escape. Valve keys are widely available at hardware stores for as little as 79p (Screwfix). Once the hissing has stopped, you can tighten the valve back up, clean up any mess and turn your heating back on. Windows and doors are responsible for about 25% of heat loss in the home but draught-proofing them could save you about £45 a year, according to the Energy Saving Trust. While the problem may be obvious – rattly windows and letterboxes or feeling a breeze on your skin – identifying slight draughts needs more careful investigation. If it’s a still day, and you own a wireless hairdryer or a standard one and a long extension lead, one easy method is to go outside and blow on the window and door frames – you will need a helper inside to feel for any air movement. Alternatively, buy a smoke pen – it should cost about £20. Pick a day when there is a good breeze but not a gale, and heat the house to its usual temperature. Then light the pen and wander around the house – if there is a draught, the smoke will blow away from it. To fix the problem, buy foam, metal or plastic draught strips, or brush seals for sash windows, cut them to size and attach around opening casements. Use a thicker option for doors. There are two main types – self-sticking and nail-on. The former is the quickest and least labour-intensive but may not last as long; but in either case, it’s an easy and effective way to plug a draught and retain household heat. The cost depends on the length and brand but you can buy nine metres of weatherstripping for as little as £2.75 on Amazon or pay £6.99 for seven metres of extra thick strips from Screwfix, with more savings made if you buy in bulk. Chimneys can also be a source of draughts and heat loss. The Energy Saving Trust estimates that installing a chimney draught excluder can save you £65 a year. Flues can be plugged easily with a chimney balloon that is inflated to fit the size of the hole. You can buy one from Amazon for £18.99. A slightly cheaper option is a draught excluder, such as a wool one by Chimney Sheep for £17.50. For both the balloon and the draught excluder, you’ll need to measure the flue first to find the correct-sized product to fit your chimney. They can easily be removed if you decide you want to use your fireplace. Curtains are an easy win for reducing draughts and retaining heat in your home. Depending on size, heavy-duty thermal-lined curtains can be bought online for as little as £14.99 from Curtains Direct 2 U. While Argos sells thermal door curtains for only £15. Alternatively, you can buy thermal lining for existing curtains – it is currently available for £3.49 a metre on Amazon. Attaching the lining is admittedly a bit fiddly. There are two main methods: either iron on fusible header tape to the top of the curtains, then attach hooks to the tape and hang the lining from that, or sew the lining directly on to the material. When stitching lining on, you’ll need to take into account the specific design features of the curtain. For instance, if it’s a curtain with eyelets, make sure the lining doesn’t cover them. For heavier curtains, make sure your pole is strong and secure enough to handle the extra weight. Make sure it doesn’t hang over the radiator as this will stop the heat from circulating properly in the room. Insulating (or lagging) pipes helps keep the heat in and prevents damage during cold winter months. There are several different types of material used for lagging – from rubber to mineral fibre – but the most popular is polyethylene foam. That’s mainly because of how affordable and easy it is to install. It’s basically a tube with a slit running down one side and can be easily slipped over the outside of a pipe. This type of pipe lagging is incredibly cheap. It’s currently on sale at Wickes, where one metre costs only 86p. The downside is that if the pipes aren’t easily accessible it could require lifting floorboards or damaging walls to get to them. Fortunately, there are plenty of pipes that can be lagged without taking drastic measures. If you have a hot water tank, pay attention to the pipes running to and from it, as well as any leading to the boiler. Central heating pipes running to radiators should also be lagged if possible, as well as hot water pipes under sinks and behind bath panels. Cold air naturally circulates below ground floor floorboards, so ideally you should insulate underneath them to reduce loss of heat. Doing so doesn’t come cheap, though, setting you back between £1,300 and £2,700 depending on the type of insulation, the flooring and the size of the room. It also requires lifting up the floorboards. An easier DIY option is to fill the small gaps between the boards using a silicone-based filler, decorators’ caulk or other specialist sealant. Because floorboards expand, contract and even move slightly with age and use, make sure any filler you buy is flexible. It comes in a variety of colours to match your flooring and a tube of No Nonsense sealant, suitable for timber and laminate, costs £4.99 from Screwfix. Spring and summer are the best times of year to undertake this work. During the cold winter months, central heating dries the air and causes the floorboards to shrink, leading to those unsightly gaps. However, filling it then means the material used is often squeezed out when the floorboards expand during warm, sultry weather. It’s best to fill floors when the humidity in the home is higher. According to Which?, a properly insulated loft can help save up to £315 a year on energy bills. It is possible to install it yourself, so long as your loft is easy to access, does not have damp problems and is not a flat roof. Rolls of mineral wool insulation can be bought easily from DIY stores. Wickes, for example, sells a roll for £22.50. There are also more eco-friendly options on the market – from sheep’s wool to recycled insulation. The latter comes in cheaper, too, at only £17 a roll from B&Q. Start by laying the insulation between the joists – the horizontal beams that make up the floor of the loft. Simply roll it out, being careful not to compress it and cause it to lose efficiency. For detailed instructions and advice on how to install it safely, there are plenty of tutorials available on YouTube or hardware store websites such as those of Wickes or Homebase. The government-endorsed Simple Energy Advice website advises adding a second layer at right angles to cover the joists, bringing the insulation up to the recommended depth of 270mm. Remember to always wear a mask, goggles and gloves when handling the material. Some energy suppliers offer free loft insulation to eligible households under the official energy company obligation scheme designed to help reduce carbon emissions and tackle fuel poverty.",Lifestyle/Money,UK energy bills are soaring – but there are easy ways to cut costs,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/14/uk-energy-bills-cut-costs-upgrade-home
5/14/2022,"Artist John Adams worked with assemblage boxes for years – eccentric cabinets of curios in the tradition of Joseph Cornell – before moving on to larger dioramas. An ex-teacher, Adams wanted to think bigger. In his studio, he sets up a group of objects on a table, like a still life. “I have a board at the back, which I can paint or drape material over,” he says. “For this piece, I added a box with a hole punched through, and put this doll in. He’s only 12 inches tall. I think I found him at a car boot sale, or a toy shop. After that, I decided to make a garden: they’re mostly cheap plastic plants from Aldi.” Adams worked on this tableau, which measured about 90cm by 120cm, for a couple of weeks on and off. Taken with his Huawei P smartphone, this photo took about three hours to capture, with tweaks along the way. “I don’t need a digital camera,” Adams says. “It comes out pin sharp on a 3ft by 2ft print or canvas. “There is always a part of you that thinks: ‘I won’t be able to destroy this afterwards,’ but it’s the photograph I’m working towards. Once that’s done, it’s time to dismantle, and make space for a new idea.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘He’s only 12 inches tall.

5/14/2022,"Having beaten Everton in the quarter-final, it was West Ham who now stood in the way of Manchester City’s bid to complete a domestic cup double. Honours were even in the clubs’ WSL meetings this season, with both sides winning their away fixture 2-0, so the Hammers fans at Dagenham & Redbridge’s stadium would be justified in dreaming of a trip to Wembley. Match day cook and West Ham fan Jane, posing above with her boss outside the kitchen on a tin of cooking oil, said: “I love working at the women’s games. It can be challenging at times but it’s really good. They [the fans] are a lot different to the Dagenham & Redbridge games, but it’s fun, it’s all fun, all banter, we do have a laugh. Ooh, it’s going to be a tough one, I hope the Hammers win. I reckon it will be about 3-1.” West Ham memorabilia, retro shirts and a West Ham tie-pin on display outside the ground, West Ham fans browse the retro shirts. John Chapman, who runs the programme and memorabilia shop at Dagenham & Redbridge as a volunteer, said: “We see what we can do to assist the club financially and provide a service to supporters. We choose to open here prior to the game and have donations here from lots of fans including items for the West Ham women and men’s games. We have shirts and photographs, loads and loads of programmes and other West Ham memorabilia. Shirts are always popular there’s no doubt about that! England and West Ham shirts. We have a variety of others - Spanish, Brazilian and even non-league clubs are popular because they’re unusual and they’re rare.” Jo Bailey, who is co-chair of Pride of Irons, the official LGBTQIA+ sports group for West Ham United, Pride in Football Women’s officer and part of West Ham’s Women’s supporter’s board said: “We are here for every home game and as many away games as we can. It’s the new ground here. It feels like the very first season even though we’ve been here for two seasons as the fans are just starting to come back. It’s getting a really good feel. It’s hugely exciting to have them all back. The club are working so hard with Dagenham & Redbridge as it’s not our club here, but it is starting to feel like our own ground. Next season the main entrance will be full of West Ham signage and branding. As a women’s club we’ve got to evolve - if we’d have stayed at Rush Green then we wouldn’t have evolved.” Asked if women’s games create a better environment for LGBTQIA+ groups, she replied: “It is inclusive, but I always say you can’t be complacent. I don’t want to get too deep on this, but the more people you get in, the more likely you are to get people from the men’s game and you could risk examples of micro-misogyny and homophobia coming in, but that’s the only negative. As it is now, it is a safe space for everyone and West Ham work so hard with especially pride of Irons and Inclusive Hammers to ensure it’s a safe space for everyone.” A steward guards the gates to the players’ entrance and West Ham fans go through the turnstiles with their father (above), Hammers fan Trevor stands with his West Ham-decorated mobility scooter that produces bubbles.

The home side started brightly in front of their biggest crowd of the season with Manchester City keeper Ellie Roebuck (below) being called into action to thwart the Hammers on a number of occasions. However, it was the visitors who struck first in the 22nd minute when a thunderous drive from Keira Walsh thumped against the underside of the crossbar and Ellen White reacted first to stoop and head in the opening goal. City stepped up a gear and a quarter of an hour later doubled their lead when Chloe Kelly (below), making her first start since May 2021 following an ACL injury, pounced on a loose pass from West Ham’s Gilly Flaherty and slotted the ball home. The home side got back into the game just before half-time courtesy of a Lisa Evans goal. A great piece of play from Adriana Leon allowed Evans behind the City back line. Coming in from the right, Evans got to the ball ahead of City keeper Roebuck and kept her composure to slot the ball into an unguarded net. A steady-cam films the players as they leave the pitch at half-time. West Ham fan Kelly, pictured above with Molly and Vicky, said: “We ended the first half strong, really strong. It dipped in the middle, but I don’t think the atmosphere was quite right - it got very quiet in the stadium. I think we were a bit nervous after the two City goals went in. The way the crowd picked up as the players were going into the tunnel - they’ll come out strong again hopefully and get going in the second half.” Despite the setback at the end of the first half, Gareth Taylor’s side were on top again after the restart and Ellen White thought she’d restored City’s two goal lead when heading in Keira Walsh’s floated cross but was denied by an offside flag. Manchester City’s Lucy Bronze and Lauren Hemp and West Ham’s Grace Fisk and Emma Snarl wait for a cross. Not long after the hour mark Lauren Hemp put City in full control again with her 50th club goal when the winger slalomed her way through the Hammers defence before firing neatly across goal and into the bottom corner. During stoppage time Hemp combined with substitute Georgia Stanway before finding the net in clinical fashion for a second time. City deserved it for their second-half display, whereas West Ham just ran out of steam. Kate Longhurst looks dejected after West Ham concede a fourth goal, City goalscorers Ellen White and Lauren Hemp celebrate after the final whistle, Manchester City’s Alex Greenwood pats Lucy Bronze on the head as the players relax after their victory. The 4-1 win meant City have now reached the FA Cup final four times in the last six seasons and having won every final they have been in, Gareth Taylor’s side will be confident of continuing their 100% record. After being beaten 3-1 by City in March’s League Cup final, Emma Hayes’ Chelsea will be looking for revenge, as well as a domestic double after winning the WSL title last weekend.

Lucky for him relegated Watford are the next team up and he will no doubt be eyeing up another tension-releasing onslaught in front of goal. Brendan Rodgers will surely be looking at long-term replacements for Vardy if the manager himself intends to stick around at the King Power for the long haul.

After an inconsistent loan spell Aston Villa will hope the creative force can refind his magic touch next season after a summer in which he can bed in fully. Steven Gerrard’s side fought hard, arguably deserving a point, in defeat to Liverpool in midweek and will be hopeful they can still secure a top-half finish if they pick up where they left off, starting with Crystal Palace. Patrick Vieira will undoubtedly feel the same and the Frenchman has the fine wind of good form at his back. A third win in succession would give Palace a great shot at 10th or a smidge higher and would be their first time in the top 10 since 2014-15.

5/14/2022,"Another away game in front of a packed and passionate crowd is not, it is safe to say, what Mikel Arteta wanted four days after the wounding defeat at Tottenham and with Champions League qualification on the line. But that is all the time the Arsenal manager has to sort out a team that barely got going on Thursday night before they were undone by defensive blunders and Spurs’ predatory strikers. The Gunners’ backline will be threadbare on Monday, with an injured Gabriel joining the suspended Rob Holding as the newest absentees. Arteta might wish he had held on to more of his fringe defenders for a season that was always going to have a fraught ending. Chris Wood and Allan Saint-Maximin may be looking forward to this one as Newcastle aim to continue their upward trajectory.

5/14/2022,"The wheels have come off in such horrific fashion for Leeds that they now are odds-on favourites to be relegated. It is not that they ever looked nailed on to survive but the manner of their past two ill-tempered, dismal defeats is potentially sounding their top-flight death knell. The squad is shattering with injuries and suspensions at a crucial time while Patrick Bamford remains a doubt to appear. One wonders how they might have fared with his goals and creativity splashed throughout the campaign. A win against in-form Brighton would be incredible for Jesse Marsch but a point would still lift them out of the bottom three if Burnley have lost at Tottenham earlier on Sunday. Burnley still will have a game in hand but it is time for pure pragmatism. Leeds’ dreadful goal difference makes that clear as day.

5/14/2022,"Thursday night to Sunday at noon. It is a gruelling turnaround for Tottenham after the emotion of the derby win over Arsenal but they have to find the reserves to produce another high-energy performance. The home crowd must do so, too, although that ought to be easier for them. Otherwise the Arsenal result could be wasted and the club’s Champions League hopes dashed. Burnley have already driven Antonio Conte to distraction once this season. Their survival hopes would soar if they could repeat the prescription.
