1/7/2022,"Joan Didion was someone whom I had long worshipped as a writer. However, we became friends and colleagues when David Hare and the producer Scott Rudin invited me to take the solo part of Joan herself in the stage version of The Year of Magical Thinking. The book had been published in 2005, and David was planning to direct it as a play on Broadway. He and his stage designer, Bob Crowley, presented a series of backdrops over a wooden deck and a wooden chair. The combination of David’s humanism and witty stage expertise and Joan’s humour and perception, along with sudden variants of abstract backdrops falling with a thud to the deck, provided a compelling subtext for Joan’s narrative, which I shared with the audience.  We performed it in New York in 2007 and the following year at the National Theatre in London.",Arts/Books,Vanessa Redgrave on Joan Didion:  ‘I worshipped her as a writer’,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/06/letter-joan-didion-obituary
1/7/2022,"My friend Simon Lewty, who has died aged 80, was an artist who inscribed words and images on layers of tissue paper, creating a richly enigmatic body of work. Typically his paintings depicted surreal city chimneys, mandrake roots and figures that might have escaped from some infernal Punch and Judy show, floating amid arcane symbols and inscriptions of dreams. In the late 1980s and early 90s, when his works appeared like timeworn maps of hinterlands haunted by ancestral voices, the environmental charity Common Ground invited him to contribute to its nationwide Parish Maps project. At the turn of the millennium, as the figurative and cartographic elements of his work disappeared, rogue letters, runes, flecks and dashes of colour infiltrated great blocks of text.  Simon was born in Sutton Coldfield, in the West Midlands, to Richard Lewty, a dental surgeon, and Marjorie (nee Lobb), who would later become a prolific author of Mills and Boon romances. Top of the class at Warwick school, he confounded his teachers’ predictions that he was destined for Oxford by opting to leave at 16 to enrol at the Mid-Warwickshire School of Art in Leamington Spa. He then went on to Hornsey Art College in London (1961–64), where he enjoyed conversations with the Marxist art historian Arnold Hauser and with characteristic independence criticised him for his neglect of the Middle Ages. Ranging from medieval graffiti to the Surrealists, Simon’s imaginative cosmos was taking shape, with Paul Klee, Giorgio de Chirico, Paul Nash and William Blake among his lodestars. In 1964 he returned to the Mid-Warwickshire to teach art and art history. Simon’s breakthrough came in the 80s. After resigning his teaching post to devote himself to his art, he was given solo shows at the Ikon Gallery, Birmingham, in 1984, and at the Serpentine in London the following year. These caught the eye of critics and soon his work was being acquired by the Arts Council, the British Museum and the V&A, as well as by museums across the Midlands. Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery also invited him to select objects from its holdings to exhibit alongside his own paintings. With his reputation established, he was taken on by the art dealer Anne Berthoud and subsequently by Art First. For much of his adult life Simon lived and worked in the same house in Leamington Spa as his mother, and he cared for her in her last years. He never ventured abroad, but after Marjorie’s death in 2002 he regularly visited Swanage, attracted by memories of the “seaside surrealism” of Nash. Imagery of sea and shore now seeped into his work. A gifted writer, he also enjoyed fruitful collaborations with the poet Peter Larkin. The British Library’s Sound Archive recorded 50 hours of Simon’s recollections for its Artists’ Lives project. Following a remarkable recovery from a stroke in 2012, he continued to make drawings right up until his death. His only sibling, Deborah, predeceased him.",Arts/Art and design,Simon Lewty obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/06/simon-lewty-obituary
1/7/2022,"Whether millennials prefer to raise plants and pets over children for financial and environmental reasons or because they’re lazy and entitled has been hotly discussed in recent years. Now Pope Francis has waded in, saying that not having children is “selfish and diminishes us” and that people are replacing them with cats and dogs.Pet owners have reacted angrily to the comments, made during a general audience at the Vatican. They argue that animals have a lower environmental footprint than children, enable them to lead a life that is different but equally rewarding, and compensate for financial or biological difficulties in having children, rather than directly replacing them.On social media, people pointed out that the pope himself chose not to have children and said there was hypocrisy in such comments, coming from an institution which has grappled with a legacy of child sexual abuse.Guardian readers who responded to a call-out asking for their views were similarly critical of the pope’s comments, which were branded “out of touch” and “sexist”.Sophie Lusby, a 48-year old NHS manager in Belfast, said they were “really naive and insensitive” and failed to reflect that not everybody can or should have children. As a Catholic, she has struggled with feelings of shame about her inability to have children for medical reasons, given her religion’s emphasis on motherhood. “That’s what’s quite triggering about the pope’s words.”She added that although she has two pets, which are “great company when you live on your own”, she doesn’t see them as substitutes for children, and instead has found meaning in her relationships with her nephews, nieces, siblings and parents. “If Catholicism is about family, I’ve been very successful at being a great family member and I don’t need to be told off.”Estee Nagy, a 27-year-old jeweller from London, said that “having a child in today’s world is a luxury” because of lower earning power and a more challenging labour market. “It’s easier for those who were simply lucky and are rich or have more money than an average salary, but it gets harder when there isn’t enough.”  Stef, who works in education, said that in her home town of Brighton “loads of people have dogs and treat them like kids”. She has taken her rescue dog, Boss, on holiday to 11 countries, including the Vatican, and feels that he is “part of the family”. “I don’t think anybody decides to have a dog instead of a child, you have a dog and you take care of the dog and it becomes like a child.”People’s feelings about their pets may reflect the immense psychological benefits of pet ownership, especially of cats and dogs, said Deborah Wells, a psychologist at Queen’s University, Belfast. Studies have shown that it results in increased companionship, feelings of self-worth and self-esteem and reduced depression, loneliness and isolation.Wells added that there was no evidence that people are using pets as replacements for children, but rather the analogy applies in the sense that they are also dependents that need to be cared for, and many owners develop “an enormous bond of attachment”.Instead, the pope’s comments likely reflect the fact that birth rates have been declining in Europe over the past seven decades, especially in traditionally Catholic countries in the south, where there is a lack of government childcare support, gender roles are more entrenched and youth unemployment is high. While just 10% of European women born in the 1950s were child-free, that rose to 15% for women born in the 1970s. Demographers predict the proportion to increase for women born from the 1980s onwards, although not at as high a rate.The reasons for falling birth rates are far more complicated than personal choice. Francesca Fiori, a demographer at the University of St Andrews, said they include precarious employment, expensive housing, economic uncertainty and a lack of affordable childcare and flexible working arrangements. She added that decision-makers would do better to focus on addressing these issues rather than blaming people.Bernice Kuang, a fertility trends researcher at the University of Southampton, said the pope’s intervention may also be premature given that evidence suggests that people born in the 1980s and 1990s are not choosing not to have children, but are delaying childbirth, often until well into their 30s, although she noted that the climate crisis is increasingly an argument against child-rearing for these generations. “It’s not that humans’ desire to have families has plummeted, circumstances are terrible for young people.”Kuang added that although European societies may worry about fertility rates given their ageing populations, and the impact this could have on pensions, healthcare and the workforce, these can be solved through immigration as there are no problems with population replacement at a global level.",News/World news,‘Insensitive’: pet owners react to pope’s remarks on animals and children,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/insensitive-pet-owners-react-to-popes-remarks-on-animals-and-children
1/7/2022,"Serge Mombo, a leading football official in Gabon, has been accused of sexually abusing young players and demanding sex as a condition of them securing places in national teams. Mombo was re-elected as president of La Ligue de l’Estuaire, Gabon’s senior football league, in June 2021. He is also set to serve as the kit man for Gabon’s senior men’s team at the African Cup of Nations in Cameroon, which begins on Sunday. Mombo, a former policeman, denied the abuse claims, made by alleged victims and witnesses to the Guardian.  He also denied claims he provided a Gabonese football coach, Patrick Assoumou Eyi, known as “Capello”, with boys to sexually abuse. Eyi, like Mombo a senior figure in the Gabonese football federation Fegafoot, is facing charges of raping minors and sexual assault after claims by alleged victims were reported by the Guardian. Two other coaches in Gabon are also facing charges. Mombo said his accusers were “lying to try to dirty my image.” One alleged victim said he was abused by Mombo and Capello in 2014 at the Heliconia hotel in Libreville, the capital of Gabon, during a training camp. “He was there, choosing some boys. We didn’t really understand why he was so powerful. Some players had to call him coach but he was a kit man. It was very weird. He did his dirty game with Capello.” The alleged victim said Mombo would give the first three pieces of watermelon to three boys they would then invite to a room to be abused. “The same night, Mombo came to my room and told me to go to Capello’s bedroom. He didn’t say more and didn’t give me the choice. It was almost 10 at night. Capello waited for me without a T-shirt. He told me that I was talented but in order to support the pressure, I would need ‘la présence d’esprit’ [presence of mind].”He added: “Capello and Mombo worked together on this. Mombo came with us on the away trips, in the same plane. He came to see us, told he could help us. I remember after a game at home that he told me: ‘If you want to play, you’ll need to give me what I want. I can make your career, even with the senior national team.’ “I came from a poor family, I was thinking about it. I’m shameful but it was my only way to help my family, you know, so I accepted his first offer. I was selected the next time but I felt so bad. Physically, emotionally, they ruined me. When I refused to go further I wasn’t selected any more with the national team.”Another former player who claimed he was abused by both Eyi and Mombo when he represented Gabon’s Under-17s in 2017 said the official attempted to proposition him with promises of a place in the starting lineup. “In the national team, Serge Mombo was a predator,” he said. “He offered us sexual propositions in exchange for a place in the team in the future. They picked us, they gave us some advantages: money, gifts and also the privilege to play for our country. “When you start to like it, to dream, they asked for sex. Basically, he told me: ‘If you want to stay with us, you’ll need to give me something.’ I asked what and he answered: ‘Your arse.’ He even offered me money if I wanted … I am a victim of both.”Both of these alleged victims have said Mombo was also working as a kit man for all of Gabon’s national youth teams. This is denied by Mombo.Mombo denied the claims of sexual abuse and said that he had “never worked with this Capello in a national team. I met him as a DTP [provincial technical director] when I was elected to the league”. “Never and never,” he added. “ Of course they are lying to try to dirty my image.” The former Gabon international Brice Makaya served as assistant to Eyi with the Under-17s in 2014 and told the Guardian that Mombo regularly travelled with the squad and the Fegafoot president, Pierre-Alain Mounguengui, to tournaments. “Mombo was the all-powerful kit man of the Gabonese football federation’s kit men. He managed the kits for managers of all age-groups of the national selections. In the under-17s when we had trips he was travelling with Mounguengui and acting as the law, and sometimes he was the decision maker.”Makaya has claimed that on a trip to Ethiopia, he informed Mounguengui of his suspicions that Eyi had been abusing players but was told “you don’t have proof”. “When he told me to calm down and there’s nothing he’ll do, I understood that it’s a system,” he said. Mounguengui did not respond to requests from comment from the Guardian. Another alleged witness has claimed they heard Mombo asking a young boy to perform a sex act on him if he wanted to be selected for the national team. “Mombo was on the phone and I was 10 metres away,” he said. The alleged witness has also claimed that Mombo confiscated the passports of players from Gabon’s Under-20 women’s team after they reported accusations of rape, abuse and sexual harassment. “He threatened them if they wanted to talk about sexual abuse,’ he added.Mombo did not respond directly to a question about whether he had confiscated players’ passports. But he added: “I promise you that if I have information on the various predators that have killed the lives and careers of some, I will communicate it to you; together we must save our football. Especially young people. I am also doing investigations at my level. If I have news, I will share it with you some time.”",Sport/Football,President of Gabon league accused of sexually abusing young footballers,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/06/president-of-gabon-league-accused-of-sexually-abusing-young-footballers
1/7/2022,"While X-Men scribe Simon Kinberg’s junky action thriller chooses not to reveal the meaning behind its truly forgettable title until the end (one of his many bizarre decisions as writer-director), I’m going to start by explaining that The 355 is a reference to Agent 355, one of America’s first female spies, deployed during the late 18th century, real identity forever unknown. Perhaps the reason we find this out so very late is that a mere whiff of this story ends up being far more dramatically enticing than the film it’s inspired, the first big release of the year doubling up as its first big disappointment.  Back in 2017, while in the middle of shooting another ill-advised disaster – the loathed X-Men spin-off Dark Phoenix – Jessica Chastain approached Kinberg about creating a female-led action thriller in the vein of James Bond and Mission: Impossible. By the following summer, the film was presented to buyers at Cannes by Chastain and co-stars, an appealingly commercial package that was unsurprisingly snapped up fast. Almost four years later, after a delayed release as a result of Covid, whatever might have worked on paper fizzles out on screen, a gussied-up pile of schlock that wastes a cast who deserve so much better. Rather than being worthy of the collective might of Chastain, Lupita Nyong’o, Penélope Cruz, Diane Kruger and Bingbing Fan, it feels like the kind of bottom shelf dross that Bruce Willis and Jesse Metcalfe would sleepwalk through to pay the bills, piles of cash handed over via grubby manilla envelopes. The derivative, stitched-together plot focuses on an all-powerful piece of tech that can hack into pretty much anything, crashing planes, tanking power grids and creating chaos for whomever its owner wants. Mace (Chastain) is an agent tasked with bringing it in along with her colleague and best friend Nick (Sebastian Stan). But the plan goes awry and Chastain is left as a lone wolf, forced into partnering with agents from around the world to figure out what happened and who is to blame. It’s every bit as generic as that sounds, with a hapless, first-draft script from Kinberg and playwright Theresa Rebeck that fails to introduce any surprise, suspense or humour, coasting along on its stretched star cast and good intentions. The genre still remains heavily male-skewed of course but simply replacing male action heroes with women and then standing back waiting for applause isn’t quite enough. There’s been a very slow inch toward a tad more equality of late, with recent female-led streaming efforts like The Old Guard, Kate and Gunpowder Milkshake easily putting The 355 in the shade, and so beyond the logline “what if Bond but with women”, there’s not much else brought to the table. The film also can’t decide if it’s skewering the genre or conforming to it. In one scene, Chastain’s character ridicules the lack of reality in a 007 movie – “James Bond never has to deal with real life” – but just a scene later, just after travelling around the world in an unexplained army plane, the on-the-lam women arrive at a gala with new outfits, new wigs and new tech, reality nowhere to be seen. Films such as The 355 live and die by the quality of their action set pieces and while there’s a propulsive pace to the proceedings, there’s never quite enough genuine excitement. The fight scenes, of which there are many, are shoddily captured despite game performers and so the action has a numbing effect, confusingly choreographed and ultimately rather boring. Chastain, who recently gave one of her finest performances in The Eyes of Tammy Faye, is a bit flat and muted here without any eccentricities to play with and so doesn’t really convince as the charismatic, take-no-prisoners lead inspiring a ragtag bunch of agents to follow her. There’s not much of interest for Nyong’o, Fan and particularly Cruz to chew on and so it’s Kruger who steals it, stepping in for the originally cast Marion Cotillard, doing a lot with very little. No one expects intricate character development with a barebones film such as this but there’s barely an attempt to even differentiate the characters outside of their nationalities, a film about strong women that reduces them to nobodies. Like the films it aspires to be like, The 355 ends with the promise of more but even without an Omicron-hit box office and a cursed January release, it’s unlikely that audiences would be clamouring for a sequel. There will be worse films to come this year but not many will be quite as hard to remember by the end of it.

1/7/2022,"Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the convicted Boston Marathon bomber, spent $2,000 on expenses such as gifts, books and support for his siblings instead of making payments he owes to his scores of victims, prosecutors charged in a court filing on Wednesday. The document listed a number of large deposits to Tsarnaev’s inmate trust account that he failed to report to the court, allegedly violating the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act.  Following Tsarnaev’s conviction in the 2013 terrorist attack that killed three people and injured hundreds more near the Boston Marathon finish line, part of his penalties included a $3,000 special assessment and $101,126,627 in criminal restitution. Yet so far, he has only paid $2,202.03, instead sending money to third parties such as his family. After sentencing, deposits to Tsarnaev’s account only became more frequent, prosecutors wrote. Among the larger payments was a $1,400 relief benefit that Tsarnaev got on 22 June. Between May 2016 and last June, he also received $11,230 from the Office of Federal Defenders of New York. Meanwhile, he has also attracted an outpouring of financial support from individuals. One person in Indianapolis sent him monthly payments for six years, for a total of $2,555. Another from Bloomfield, New Jersey, contributed $1,450 between 2015 and 2017. Another from Frederick, Maryland, deposited $950 over roughly five years, and a broader swath of 32 others have sent a collective $3,486.60. In response to the prosecutors’ motion, a US district judge has already authorized the Bureau of Prisons to turn over the funds from Tsarnaev’s account to cover part of his criminal monetary penalties. Near the end of December, Tsarnaev had roughly $3,885.06 in his account. The Boston bombing was the scene one of the most harrowing terrorist attacks in recent American history. After Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev planted pressure-cooker bombs at the marathon, the world watched as a violent manhunt ensued. During a gun battle with police, Tamerlan sustained mortal injuries – some of which were inflicted by Dzhokhar, who ran over his brother in a Mercedes SUV. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was later found covered in blood and taken into custody. He was sentenced to death in 2015. An appeals court ruled to overturn the execution in 2020, and the supreme court is now considering whether to reimpose it.

1/7/2022,"A deputy district attorney from California who regularly spoke out against vaccine mandates has died of complications from Covid-19. Kelly Ernby, 46, a prosecutor from Orange county, southern California, who recently ran for the state assembly, died after contracting the virus, her family and friends have said.  According to Ernby’s husband, Axel Mattias Ernby, Kelly Ernby was unvaccinated at the time of her death, a decision he had cited on social media posts about her passing. “She was NOT vaccinated. That’s the problem,” Axel Ernby said on social media posts. A month before her death, Kelly Ernby spoke out against Covid-19 vaccine mandates at a rally outside of Irvine city hall. The protest was organized by chapters of Turning Point USA, a conservative youth organization, representing members at California State University, Fullerton and University of California Irvine. “There’s nothing that matters more than our freedoms right now,” Ernby said, according to the Daily Titan, a student newspaper. On her personal Facebook, Ernby also spoke out against Covid vaccine mandates, writing in August 2021 that “vaccine is not the cure to Covid, and mandates won’t work”. Before the pandemic, Ernby also denounced vaccine mandates. At an online town hall in 2019, Ernby said she opposed a new state law that would tighten vaccine rules for California school children. “My fundamental belief is that government should be very small and I don’t believe in mandates,” said Ernby on 3 November 2019. “I don’t think that the government should be involved in mandating what vaccines people are taking,” she said. “I think that’s a decision between doctors and their patients … If the government is going to mandate vaccines, what else are they going to mandate?” Ernby lived in Huntington Beach, California, an hour outside of Los Angeles, where a number of anti-vaccine mandate rallies have taken place. She had worked in the district attorney’s office since 2011 and specialized in environmental and consumer law, according to a statement posted by Orangecounty district attorney Todd Spitzer. “Kelly was an incredibly vibrant and passionate attorney who cared deeply about the work that we do as prosecutors – and deeply about the community we all fight so hard to protect,” said Spitzer in the statement following Ernby’s death. In 2019, Ernby ran for the California state assembly and lost in the 2020 primary to fellow Republican politician Diane Dixon. Ernby later was elected as an Orange county GOP central committee member in 2020 but died halfway through her four-year term. Vaccine mandates have continued to receive pushback, despite soaring cases of the Omicron variant. The Mayo Clinic, the non-profit medical center, fired about 700 employees who refused to comply with the mandatory Covid-19 vaccination policy, reported NBC news. Employees were told to receive their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine by Monday or get a medical or religious exemption. Staff who had already received their first jab were told to not delay getting their second shot. “While Mayo Clinic is saddened to lose valuable employees, we need to take all steps necessary to keep our patients, workforce, visitors and communities safe,” said the clinic in a statement, also confirming that 99% of Mayo Clinic employees across all locations complied with the mandate.",News/US news,California prosecutor who campaigned against vaccine mandates dies of Covid ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/06/kelly-ernby-california-prosecutor-dies-covid
1/7/2022,"Boris Johnson has criticised anti-Covid vaccine activists for spreading “nonsense” on social media, while stressing that he does not support moves to overtly pressure people into getting vaccinated. “I want to say to the anti-vax campaigners, the people who are putting this mumbo jumbo on social media: they are completely wrong,” Johnson told broadcasters on a visit to a vaccination centre in Moulton Park, Northampton.  “You haven’t heard me say that before, because I think it’s important we have a voluntary approach in this country and we’re going to keep a voluntary approach.” While some other European countries were trying “coercion”, the prime minister said, this would not happen in England. But he added: “What a tragedy that we’ve got all this pressure on the NHS, all the difficulties that our doctors and nurses are experiencing, and we’ve got people out there spouting complete nonsense about vaccination. “They are totally wrong, and I think it’s time that I, the government, call them out on what they’re doing. It’s absolutely wrong, it’s totally counterproductive, and the stuff they’re putting out on social media is complete mumbo jumbo.” In an interview published on Wednesday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, explained that it was his overt plan to make life difficult for unvaccinated citizens. Macron said he wanted to put them “in the shit” – using the verb emmerder, a vulgar slang term derived from merde (shit) – by “limiting as much as possible their access to activities in social life”. Macron said: “We have to tell [the unvaccinated] … you will no longer be able to go to a restaurant, you will no longer be able to go for a coffee, you will no longer be able to go to the theatre, you will no longer be able to go to the cinema. We will continue to do this, to the end. This is the strategy.” Johnson’s approach for England – health policy is devolved between UK nations – is different, although he has introduced Covid passports, requiring proof of double-jabbed status or a recent negative test, for access to nightclubs and larger venues such as sports grounds. Even this was notably unpopular with Tory MPs, 101 of whom rebelled in a Commons vote in December, leaving him reliant on Labour support for the measure to pass.

1/7/2022,"The newly knighted Sir Tony Blair is one of several well-paid western advisers who have burnished the image of Kazakhstan’s former ruler Nursultan Nazarbayev and his autocratic regime, now the target of angry protesters. Narzabayev invited Blair to give him strategic advice after Kazakh security forces shot dead 14 people during the country’s December 2011 anti-government uprising. The protesters in the western oil town of Zhanaozen were demanding higher wages.  Although the unrest then was on a lesser scale than this week’s rebellion, the government’s heavy-handed response dealt a serious blow to its international reputation. Blair offered advice on a speech Nazarbayev made in Cambridge, where the Kazakh leader was to make his case to a western audience of academics and dignitaries. In a letter to Narzabayev, Blair advised the president to “meet head-on the Zhanaozen issue” while stressing the “enormous progress” Kazakhstan had made since its independence from the Soviet Union. Blair urged the dictator to stress he “understood” what his critics were saying. The former Labour prime minister suggested Nazarbayev say reforms would “take time” and should be done “with care and with stability uppermost”. The Kazakh government is said to have paid Blair $13m for his services, with Narzabayev incorporating his ideas in the speech. Blair signed off by writing: “With very best wishes. I look forward to seeing you in London! Yours ever, Tony Blair.” The Kazakh regime has spent – sometimes covertly – large sums in recent years to improve its standing in the west and to rebut persistent allegations of corruption and lavish spending by Narzabayev and his family. His daughter and grandson own £80m of property in London. In 2020 the National Crime Agency lost an attempt in the high court to force them to explain where the money came from. Blair’s former consultancy firm, Tony Blair Associates, signed a deal to advise Kazakhstan’s government in 2011, months after Nazarbeyev was controversially re-elected with 96% of the vote and weeks before the massacre. The former Conservative cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken wrote two flattering books about Nazarbayev. Aitken travelled around the country on a plane belonging to Sir Richard Evans, the former head of BAE Systems who sits on the board of Samruk, a Kazakh state holding company. The Guardian described Aitken’s 2009 Narzarbayev and the Making of Kazakhstan as “quite probably the hagiography of the year”. He denied receiving money from the regime for the work, which skirted over repression and Kazakhstan’s poor human rights record. But the Pandora Papers, a trove of leaked data exposing tax haven secrecy reported on by the Guardian and others, suggested Aitken was paid £166,000. According to the papers, World PR, a firm that represents several Kazakh ministries, sent the cash to the former MP’s Oxford bank account via the British Virgin Islands. It allegedly also paid for his hotel and book tour in the US. Meanwhile, London-based bankers have earned large fees from assisting with the flotation on the London Stock Exchange of Kazakh mining conglomerates. They include the Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC) and Kazakhmys, which mines the country’s copper. The late businessman and Tory party chairman Sir Paul Judge was an EHRC director. The company also hired and subsequently ousted Sir Richard Sykes, the former head of GlaxoSmithKline and chancellor of Brunel University. A spokesperson for Blair said he was not an adviser to Narzarbayev but did “give thoughts” on the president’s speech and said he should deal with human rights issues during his UK trip. The Kazakhstan project was in line with international community goals and was “focused on the government’s change and reform programme,” they added. The project fee did not go to Blair personally and mostly funded an in-country team, they said, with the “business side” of his consultancy work ending in 2016.",News/World news,How Tony Blair advised former Kazakh ruler after 2011 uprising,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/how-tony-blair-advised-former-kazakh-ruler-after-2011-uprising
1/7/2022,"For a second time, Boris Johnson has been cleared of breaching the ministerial code over concerns about how he funded renovations to his Downing Street flat. The saga has lasted two years and spawned several investigations, most of which have now concluded.  This is what we know so far. In February 2021, media reports surfaced that Johnson was having renovations to the No 11 flat he lives in with his wife, Carrie, and their children, funded by a Tory donor. Although prime ministers get £30,000 of public money a year to spruce up their official residence, the cost of the renovation reportedly well exceeded that – rising to as high as £200,000. The Daily Mail said some additional payments were made through the Conservative party and had not been properly declared, so the idea of a trust was floated – like those that help pay for the upkeep of the prime minister’s countryside retreat, Chequers. In March, Downing Street at the time insisted Johnson had met all the costs personally. It later turned out others had originally footed the bill, but he than came up with the money himself and the original payees were refunded. Then in April 2021, a leaked email came to light from a Tory peer, David Brownlow, to the co-chair of the Conservatives, Ben Elliot, from October 2020. Brownlow confirmed he was making a £15,000 donation, and another worth £58,000 “to cover the payments the party has already made on behalf of the soon to be formed Downing Street trust”. Facing huge pressure, Johnson appointed a new ethics adviser, Lord Geidt, to look into a potential breach of the ministerial code. Geidt’s inquiry said that to ensure credibility, he had “tested the assertions” that “at no point” until the media reports first emerged did Johnson know either “the fact or the method” of money being paid to cover the refurbishment. Although the work had started almost a year previously, Geidt said he had spoken directly to Johnson and the prime minister said “he knew nothing about such payments until immediately prior to media reports in February 2021”. Geidt said Johnson had acted “unwisely”, but cleared him of breaching the ministerial code. While Geidt’s inquiry was under way, the Electoral Commission began its own, saying there were “reasonable grounds” to suspect an offence might have occurred. After eight months, it published its findings in December 2021. The watchdog found the Conservatives had not reported Brownlow’s £58,000 donation and fined the party just over £17,000. In its report, the commission confirmed that as early as 21 January 2020 – just a month after Johnson’s landslide election win – the supplier of the refurbishment work provided a detailed proposal to No 10 about the flat refurb. A curious piece of evidence also emerged from the commission’s findings: that Johnson messaged Brownlow on WhatsApp in November 2020 “asking him to authorise further, at that stage unspecified, refurbishment works on the residence”, and that Brownlow agreed and explained about the concept of the trust. This appeared to suggest a discrepancy with Johnson’s original insistence to Geidt he “knew nothing” about the payments. Unhappy he had not been given a key piece of evidence, Geidt spent the following month exchanging letters with Johnson figuring out why, and whether it should alter the findings of his initial report. Geidt eventually concluded that he still believed Johnson had not broken the ministerial code. If he had, it could have set off a seriously damaging chain of events for the government. Usually, those who break the ministerial code are forced to resign – though Johnson has previously spared a cabinet colleague this fate. There could yet be another investigation, launched by the parliamentary standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone. She was awaiting the Electoral Commission report, and will also probably have wanted to see Geidt’s take before deciding whether to launch an inquiry of her own. This could still be damaging to Johnson, given Stone has powers to recommend sanctions to be imposed on any MP found guilty of breaking the code of conduct, including for them to make an apology or be suspended from the Commons.",News/Politics,What did second investigation into Boris Johnson flat refurb find?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/06/what-did-second-investigation-into-boris-johnson-flat-refurb-find
1/7/2022,"Superannuation is the fancy word for your retirement fund. In Australia, your employer is mandated to pay 10% of your salary into your super account.  Your account is held by a super fund that invests your money on your behalf. That way, your money is making more money instead of sitting there, losing its value to inflation. But when we first start working, most of us don’t know what super is. So we go with an employer’s recommendation. Then we move jobs, open a new account, and end up with multiple accounts. Super funds charge you various fees for their services. When you have multiple super accounts, you are paying fees on each one. But if you put all the money into one super account, consolidate your super – voilà! You will save thousands of dollars in fees, find that one account is easier to manage (no more losing track of your super!) and compound your investment returns by pooling all your money together. Before you consolidate your super, there are two things you should consider doing. First, compare super funds and choose the one that’s right for you – this may not be one that you already have. Second, you may want to seek advice on fees this may incur or insurance cover you may lose. Speak to your fund or a financial adviser about it. But, ultimately, the consolidating is quick and easy. Log in to your myGov account (or create one). Link your Australian Taxation Office account to myGov (click on “Link a service” and follow the instructions). Select “Super” from the top menu. You can then find any “lost” super and consolidate all your accounts into one. This will take you less than five minutes, but in future you will be glad you took the time.

1/7/2022,"If there has been rain and it’s after dark, Daryl Dickson listens for a shower of drops bumped loose from the leaves above. When it’s dry, it could be the faint sound of the caps of bloodwood blossoms landing on her roof that sends her off to grab a torch and catch a glimpse of one of her elusive marsupial neighbours.  “I don’t think there’s anything more magnificent than seeing a big mahogany glider go over the top of you. I just think they’re beautiful,” she says. When artist Dickson moved to Meunga Creek near Cardwell in far north Queensland almost 30 years ago, she had no clue she was sharing her home with a unique mammal. Her block, it turns out, is not the “rubbish scrub” the real estate agent told her about. Rather, it is prime and precious habitat for the mahogany glider, which is living a precarious existence on Earth in a thin but fragmented strip of coastal woodland just 120km long. Australia has seven possum-like gliding marsupials, but the mahogany is the most threatened. The earliest known specimen was collected in 1886 near Cardwell by a collector at Queensland Museum, but had lain in a drawer without ever being identified as a unique species. In 1986 when the museum was moving, staff wondered if this much larger specimen might be a different species. After returning to the location again, staff eventually found the glider four years later. The name mahogany comes from its colour and the swamp mahogany tree – one of the important species in its habitat. The gliders, which grow up to 28cm long and have tails up to 41cm in length, live in tree hollows and like open wet woodlands and tea tree swamps, but about 80% of their habitat has been lost. What’s left is badly fragmented by agriculture and human settlement. Now, the glider habitat is fractured into almost 1,000 individual pieces. The last estimate suggested there were no more than 2,000 individuals left. But that count was before 2011’s Cyclone Yasi – one of the state’s most powerful recorded cyclones that smashed the glider’s tiny bolthole. “Since cyclone Yasi, we’re not really sure how many there are,” says Andrew Dennis, who is coordinating a five-year project to save the glider at Terrain NRM, an environmental management organisation. “They’re actually quite hard to trap. They feed mostly on nectar and tree sap and it’s quite hard to get them attracted to a bait.” So far, the bait that works the best for the mahogany gliders has turned out to be raspberry cordial. “We have to spray quite a bit of it around the camera and the cages,” says Dennis. The Guardian can reveal there is hope a community of the gliders could have been hiding out for a few thousand years, unnoticed by any humans, on Hinchinbrook Island – a wilderness national park less than 10km off the coast. Modelling of the glider’s habitat suggests the island is “high quality mahogany glider habitat”, says Dennis. A team put up 20 camera traps on the island for six weeks and brought them in just before Christmas. There were no mahogany gliders spotted, but in the final hours before the cameras were removed one caught an image of a sugar glider – a smaller close cousin of the mahogany. “Finding that sugar glider is tantalising,” says Dennis. “They’re often in the same forests together with mahogany gliders.” Researcher Eryn Chang is two years into a PhD at James Cook University. She led the work to model the gliders’ habitat and is working to understand their genetic health. So far, she has taken tiny tissue samples from the ears of 22 gliders to analyse. “They’re very difficult to catch,” she says. “But they’re extremely cute for sure. Anyone who handles them loves them.” Using a flap of membrane attached to their wrists and ankles, mahogany gliders can propel themselves up to 60 metres from one tree to another. All agree it’s a wondrous sight. “It’s magnificent to see them glide. It’s like... Wow,” says Chang. Her genetics work will give clues about the viability of the different groups of gliders spread in small pockets around the area. “We can then know if a population is suffering from in-breeding or if they’ve been recently connected to other groups,” she says. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning If any mahogany gliders are hiding out on Hinchinbrook, then Chang wonders how being cut off from other populations will have affected their genetic diversity. How much might the gliders have changed over thousands of years of isolation? Could they really have survived there? She hopes they’re questions she’ll get to investigate. Even if mahogany gliders are not found on the island, Dennis says Hinchinbrook could be an option in the future as a refuge to relocate some mahogany gliders to live without many of the threats they face on the mainland. A large group of stakeholders from local, state and federal government agencies, conservation groups, Indigenous Girringun rangers and plantation managers have completed a draft national recovery plan for the mahogany glider. The plan is currently with federal environment minister Sussan Ley for final approval. Terrain NRM is working with Indigenous rangers to carry out controlled cool burns. Historically, Indigenous groups managed the glider habitat with fire that kept rainforest vegetation out and retained the woodland trees that gliders prefer. As clearing and development along the coast has made the gaps between trees wider, the gliders have struggled to make the distance, often getting caught on barbed wire. There’s also work with landholders and volunteers to plant trees to create corridors and to replace the barbed wires at the top of fences with plain wire. The gliders are awkward and vulnerable on the ground. Poles resembling wire-free telegraph poles have gone up in 10 locations to help them bridge gaps over roads and fields. Cameras have caught the gliders using them. “There’s this sound of a glider landing on a tree trunk – like a whack and then a scratch. You’ll then hear a little scamper up the trunk,” says Dennis. Dickson and husband Geoff have nursed about 25 wounded mahogany gliders over the years, mostly with injuries caused by their flying membrane being snagged on fences. Most years one or two mahoganies arrive for care with Dickson. But after Yasi hit, there was a seven-year gap until the next one arrived. Three gliders have been dropped at her small sanctuary for care in the past three years. The first gliders arrived at Dickson’s home in 2000 in the form of two tiny 19 gram “jellybeans” pulled from the pouch of a dead mother found at a nearby caravan park. Only one survived. “They were see-through,” she says. “You could see their hearts beating. From then there was no chance we would ever lose our love for this species.”",News/Australia news,Island hideaway: has the endangered mahogany glider found a new home off the Great Barrier Reef?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/07/island-hideaway-has-the-endangered-mahogany-glider-found-a-new-home-off-the-great-barrier-reef
1/7/2022,"Arriving home to a heatwave, I open the front door to see the house has swollen in the heat. It’s an old miner’s cottage built on dirt, no proper foundations. It seems to breathe and change form depending on the weather. Remember that scene in Willy Wonka where Violet Beauregarde eats the forbidden gum and turns purple then expands like a blueberry? My house is Violet Beauregarde. The skirting boards have popped off and detached from the wall, a deep crack has appeared in the ceiling, and the ceiling and the wall appears to have separated. Will the house cleave in two if the heatwave continues? And if so, what does that mean? What should I do?  There’s been a run of 37C days. I take cold showers at night and sleep with a wet cloth on my head. The air has weight and thickness. Breathing feels like taking something in that’s heavier than air. I buy some fans and am dismayed to learn upon opening the box that I have to assemble them myself. Making a fan seems a task too complex and important for a layperson. I worry that my friends in the spare room will be killed in the night, decapitated by a fan blade flying through the air as it becomes detached and airborne. We are in a liminal zone – the days between Christmas and New Year’s. Who even knows what day it is? Time seems to stretch, a week crawls and purposelessness pervades. It has always been like this – but Omicron gives this baggy week a sinister edge. The detritus on the kitchen table reflects this new place where we have found ourselves: the plastic swabs and small bottles of solution, results windows and concertina instructions of the rapid antigen tests. I take Rats, my friends take Rats, we send each other photos or screenshots of our negative Rats or inform each other over group Whatsapp of a positive Rat – until a point, just after New Year’s, where there are no Rats, but everyone seems to know someone who is sick, or are sick themselves (the scratchy throat, the dry cough … ) or are isolating or waiting in some queue, somewhere, for a PCR, until after hours and hours of not moving or the centre closes, they go away. But on New Year’s Eve we are all negative – and there are some grounds for hope. 2022 will be better. This year is almost over. We don’t have it. We are not in lockdown. We can go out. On the last day of the year we walk along a ridge, over the tufts of dry grass where last year I saw a brown snake cross our path – and we cool off by jumping in an old quarry converted into a reservoir. It’s like a Frederick McCubbin painting. The last hours of the year we sit under a tree, share a bottle of wine and say what we want from the new year. The wants are modest. This is Year 3, after all, and no one is dreaming big. Two days later, a cabbie comes to take me to the train station. The house is still swelling. Maybe when I return I’ll have two houses. As the cab pulls up, I’m outside with a glass of water, and instead of throwing the water out – which I intend to do – the glass slips from my hand and smashes dramatically on the porch. It looks like the operatic gesture of a mad person, like I’ve just gone outside and wantonly hurled a glass. It is one of those heavy crystal tumblers; the shards will be stepped on for years. The cabbie helps me clean it up and tells me that houses like mine are diabolical: “Only good for keeping the animals out.” Each year city people fall in love with them “because they’re cute”. They do a summer there and realise “it’s like sleeping in a hot tent”, he says. “They flip them pretty quick after that.” Not me. I love my sweat lodge. “The house is swelling up,” I tell him. “It’s coming apart at the seams. The other day the ceiling split from the walls.” On the way to the station he tells me about his house, which has double glazing and a split-system cooling. We say goodbye then he returns to the station because, inexplicably, he finds my credit card on the road. He comes back a third time – just before I get on the train – because I’ve left my phone in the backseat. “The heat makes me crazy and forgetful,” I say. Down at the beach I reunite with friends who have been away from Australia for more than two years and had to delay coming back because they got Covid. They have been living in the UK and are pasty and jet lagged. The wind is nasty and hot, a southerly that is dragging the seaweed up from the shore and dumping it in huge piles on the sand. When we get to the beach, one of my friends drops to his knees in the sand and says: “The beach, the beach.” I am not sure if he is being ironic or real, but I leave him to it. Even though the conditions are bad (sand whipping around in circles, jellyfish particles washed up on the sand, a recent bull shark sighting), he runs into the sea and comes back grinning with joy. Itake a three-and-a-half-hour train journey down the west coast. The coast is cold and windy and the heat and my swollen house seem like another country. I visit friends in isolation and bring them morning coffees. Other friends visit me and send me screenshots of negative Rat tests. Other friends cancel visits because of positive Rat tests. But the wheels are falling off faster in 2022 – which is itself an extension of the Christmas/New Year’s liminal zone. In this popular tourist town, restaurants and cafes are shut, unable to get staff or because workers are isolating. No one can buy tests anymore. So many people are sick now. Even last week’s modest resolutions and hopes for the new year seemed outlandishly ambitious and out of reach. We are only four days in … but still. Down the coast I’m looking after a dog that eats plastic ornaments off the Christmas tree. He just jumps up and gobbles them whole. It is the least strange thing about this summer.

1/7/2022,"Director Matthew Walker’s irresistibly fun and jaunty documentary follows an artist you’ve most likely never heard of, but after a viewing will probably never forget: Wanita Bahtiyar, Australia’s self-professed “queen of honky tonk”, country music singer and longtime sex worker. The film begins with her walking down an outback road in a beautiful royal blue dress, declaring via voiceover that “it’s insane, all of this is insane” – an accurate description of the contemporary human condition. Flighty, squirrely and eccentric, Wanita is someone most would call “a free spirit” – though she is certainly no pushover or shrinking violet; early in the film, Wanita reflects on how her mother once told her Hank Williams died from singing, which led her to think “that’s how I’m going to go”. There is an inference that Wanita has frittered some of her life away, getting “sidetracked” in Tamworth, New South Wales for 25 years, missing or squandering opportunities, partly as a result of her fickle and bullish personality.  But now the subject is a “woman on a mission”, in her own words, who “always goes her own way” as her husband Baba puts it. This mission – to fly to America and record a full country album – gives the rudderless Wanita a purpose and the film a straightforward “on the road” narrative arc. We follow Wanita and her friends and fellow musos, her manager Gleny, and Archer, who she claims to have found under a bridge, as they travel to Nashville, making some stops along the way – performing to strangers on the street and in the airport, and recording a track in a New Orleans studio. Wanita has a terrific voice, no doubt about it, and – more importantly for the documentary – a colourful turn of phrase. She is charming in a rough and rowdy way, with a straight-to-the-bone candidness and self-effacing style. “I’d like to not look like a fuckwit,” she says at one point, of her big plan. On another occasion she enters a room and declares: “Take your hands off your genitals, the queen is in your presence.” In other words, Wanita is “good talent” as they say in documentary land, whose charm is very entertainingly reflected in the tone and texture of the film. Like a rollicking piece of music, I’m Wanita has a zesty rhythm and tempo; even when there’s no singing or tunes, one feels inclined to strum their knees and tap their toes to it. It joins a growing list of recent Australian docos presented in aesthetics inspired by the artists they explore, such as The Witch of King’s Cross (one of the best homegrown films of 2021), Ecco Homo and Whiteley. This is an easier task to achieve in productions about visual artists, whose work can be presented on screen, rather than those about musicians, beyond peppering the soundtrack with their music. Director Walker does that but also brings visual playfulness, avoiding the boring talking heads format and picking out certain words and turns of phrase from Wanita’s unpredictable tongue and displaying them in large capital letters, including “SOFT COCKERISM”, “I’M AN INFINITE NUMBER CONFIDENT” and “FUCK! YA KNOW?” I’m Wanita comes together very smoothly and appealingly, with some meaty themes under the hood: this is a film about how life dreams do not (or do not have to) disappear as youth fades. And – without wanting to sound cheesy, because the film certainly isn’t – I’m Wanita is about embracing life as a journey, rather than a destination. It’s also a vivid portrait of a very artistic way of living: about the pain, exhilaration, fun, and terror, and the highs and lows of living life outside the prescribed boxes and definitions. Walker doesn’t make the mistake of suggesting this is the “right” or the “wrong” way to live, and in fact draws attention to some of the selfish aspects of art as a way of life – articulated primarily by the subject’s estranged daughter, who clearly has complex feelings towards her mother. Perhaps the core message is that we are all walking in our own way, to our own beat, through the wilderness – or, as the case may be, down an outback tree-lined road, reflecting on the insanity of existence.

1/7/2022,"In Cape York’s Indigenous communities, locals are anxious for rain. Covid cases have spread to remote parts of northern Australia for the first time – just days before the expected onset of the wet season that will cut road access to large swaths of the Cape for months.  Soon, the only way into the Aboriginal community of Lockhart River will be by air. The flood waters could represent a circuit-breaker to help restrict arrivals and keep Covid infections at bay. Or, in a worst-case scenario where the virus arrives before the rain, they could hem in vulnerable people living in overcrowded homes and unable to isolate; people living with chronic health conditions that can heighten the severity of Covid. “We’re burying people too young as it is,” the Lockhart River mayor, Wayne Butcher, told Guardian Australia. “The last four women we buried in our community were under the age of 45. The last thing we need is Covid.” Butcher said he received about 100 phone calls earlier this week when health authorities announced a case had been detected in Lockhart River. Outbreaks have already taken hold in Cherbourg – where there are more than 100 cases, including two people in intensive care – and on Palm Island. Cases have also been detected in other parts of Cape York and in the Torres Strait. The Lockhart River case is, fortunately, isolated about 8km from the town. “Everyone is in panic mode at the moment,” said Butcher. “People are very worried. The festive season is probably the worst time, because the majority of our people go down to Cairns, they’re shopping for Christmas, visiting family and coming back.” The onset of the wet season now feels like a race against time. “We won’t be able to control Covid here because of the culture of sharing. We’ve got two-bedroom houses with 15 people living in it. “We saw that out in Wilcannia, Bourke and western NSW, they were able to drive 100 caravan homes out there to put people out in the paddocks. In the wet season we won’t be able to drive a four-wheel-drive into Cape York. “If we keep Covid out, we’ve got a natural gate for three months. But now we’ve already got cases in the Torres Strait and we’ve got cases in Cape York. It’s only going to grow by the minute. It’s a wait and see game now.” Queensland recorded more than 10,000 confirmed Covid cases across the state on Thursday. The explosion of case numbers has been tempered with news that there are still relatively few people in hospital, in intensive care, or requiring a ventilator. Jason Agostino, the senior medical adviser to the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, said Indigenous people and those living in remote communities were at heightened risk. “It’s safe to assume that we’re going to see higher rates of infection and more people with severe disease in remote communities because of higher rates of chronic conditions that lead to more severe Covid, like diabetes and heart disease,” Agostino said. “[In previous outbreaks] Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people had been infected at twice the rate. There have been higher hospitalisations and ICU admissions in every single age group and we expect that to continue through Omicron. “The challenge in Queensland is how stretched the health system is already. With really large Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island communities in Queensland being affected at the same time, their ability to respond [will be impaired].” The Queensland Aboriginal and Islander Health Council had expressed “profound disappointment” that border decisions had been made without consultation with First Nations people, particularly given the vaccination take-up had been slow in some places. As the outbreak spreads, health workers are going door-to-door on Palm Island attempting to lift that rate. Butcher, who is the co-chair of the Indigenous Leaders Forum, said remote communities had wanted the Queensland border re-opening delayed until the New Year. “We were very concerned, the Indigenous shires, simply because some of the communities weren’t double-vaxxed enough,” Butcher said. “We were asking the Queensland government to hold off until after the New Year to give us more time. “But I guess we’re a minority in this state.”",News/Australia news,Indigenous communities await wet season’s ‘natural gate’ as Covid creeps north,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/07/indigenous-communities-await-wet-seasons-natural-gate-as-covid-creeps-north
1/7/2022,"I am a man in my early 40s, a college graduate with three young kids and generally speaking have no money worries. Having worked in finance since I left university, I recently changed career by moving into a more generalist role with the civil service. I left finance because I wasn’t willing to commit to the long hours my employer demanded. I have more time with the family and am even studying again, so all should be fine now. Except it isn’t. I find I am beset by poisonous comparisons. I constantly compare myself to my friends, my relations, siblings and people I have previously worked and studied with. An old and dear friend has recently gained a prestigious promotion and instead of being happy for him I am quite jealous. I cannot even read a biography without comparing my position to the subjects. It’s frankly very foolish and petty of me.  Intellectually I know I have nothing to be ashamed of. But in my gut I don’t feel this. I find myself wondering what is wrong with me, that I’m not at the same position in life as some of my peers. How can I stop wasting my time on stupid comparisons? Eleanor says: Sometimes when we step away from a particular set of values, it takes a while to stop measuring ourselves by them. We know we don’t agree with those values; we know why we chose to walk away; but still we default to them in how we criticise ourselves and what we desire or covet. It happens in all kinds of exits: we decide we want to leave a relationship, a culture or a job, but months later find we’re still seeing ourselves through its eyes. I wonder whether that might be what’s going on for you. You’ve made a big life change by moving away from a career that gave you financial stability and a clear identity, and though you know why you chose to walk away, that doesn’t guarantee it has quite walked away from you. Expectations about what’s worth wanting set up deep root systems inside our minds; we don’t get to weed them out overnight. It may be that this envy, this feeling of losing-by-comparison, is a reflexive scolding from the part of you still habituated to those norms. After all, envy isn’t just wanting what other people have; it’s feeling that there’s something shameful about the fact we don’t already have it – as though that lack reveals some deeper truth about us that we’d rather not face. Happily, there are some ways we can shrink the space between leaving a set of values and no longer measuring ourselves by them. One is to try to covet what you have now, instead of what the self-critical voice tells you to want. You say you feel preoccupied by others’ promotions and prestige. But how would those people see you? Many of the people in the positions you envy – who spend their days in glass corner offices and their nights in long meetings – can’t bear seeing pictures of their contemporaries on holidays with the kids or running around with the dog, because for them, those are the things worth envying. Many people wish they had the time with their families that you do now – or even just the ability to say out loud how much they’d value it. So consciously set aside some time to look at your life like an envious outsider peeping in – look, this man has the autonomy to make decisions; the bravery to leave a well-paying job; the self-possession to pursue new skills; no money worries! Ask what else people would say of you while thinking “I wish I were more like that”. Actively taking time to value what we have can retrain the part of us that criticises what we lack. And remember that you can build your own opportunities to feel proud and purposeful. Careers hand us a sort of “snakes and ladders” version of what to want next and how to get to it, but you can make your own. In the meantime, try not to be unkind to yourself by calling this “petty” or “foolish”. Envy can cling to all kinds of things, from jobs to spouses to hair or humour. The one thing all forms of envy have in common is they trace what we feel embarrassed about. In time, as your values catch up to your decisions, you won’t measure yourself like that any more.

1/7/2022,"New South Wales hospitals are preparing for Covid-related admissions to triple as cases soar, forcing further cuts or delays in care that could have long-lasting health effects, doctors and medical experts say. Australia posted another record of more than 72,000 Covid cases on Thursday, including almost 35,000 in NSW. But restrictions on access to testing and patchy reporting means the true figure is likely to be far higher than the reported tallies.  “Given the proportion of people testing positive, I mean, probably you can double it,” a senior NSW health official said. In NSW, about one-third of tests are returned positive. The official, who was not authorised to comment publicly, said case numbers really took offer after Christmas. Cases in western Sydney, for instance, went from 500 to 5,000 a day. “That’s what an exponential increase looks like – an order of magnitude difference. Where does it stop?,” the official said. “The sky’s the limit.” While hospitalisation rates have increased, the system may still be about two weeks from a rise commensurate with the jump in cases, given the time it typically takes infected people to get sufficiently ill for hospital admission. “There isn’t much sign of an uptick yet,” the official said. “But we are worried, very worried.” That concern is shared inside hospitals. One senior doctor said on present trajectories, “in two weeks we’ll be having 400 admissions a day” in NSW, or more than triple the current pace of about 120. “It’s currently very alarming in the medical world,” the doctor said. Staff at Concord hospital in Sydney’s inner-west, for instance, were informed on Thursday the hospital would triple its Covid capacity. Its three Covid wards currently have about 60 Covid patients. “Almost the entire staffing structure will be diverted to Covid with very little left for people, you know, having heart attacks and strokes [or] gastrointestinal bleeds, or whatever else it is that people are normally in hospital with,” the doctor said. Liverpool, with about 180 Covid patients, was gearing up for 600, with other hospitals similarly preparing for a major surge, another senior doctor said. NSW’s health department was approached for comment. Michael Lydeamore, a Monash University infectious diseases modeller who is part of the Doherty Institute modelling used to advise the national cabinet, said the time between people knowing they were Covid-positive and finding they needed hospitalisation was likely getting shorter given the breakdown in testing and tracing.Taking Victoria’s second wave, “which obviously was way, way smaller [than the current Omicron one], I think it took hospitalisations to peak some three or four weeks later than cases” Lydeamore said. “And I don’t see why that would be any different here.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning While political leaders such as prime minister, Scott Morrison, talk of “riding the wave” in reality, “it’s more like a wall of water”, he said. “Hospitals are sort of designed to always be full because they’re expensive to run, so no one will build more than you need to,” Lydeamore said. “But they’re not really designed to be this full.” Elective surgery, which had not recovered from last year’s Delta Covid variant disruptions, will now be wound back severely to free up beds and staff. A proportion of ICU beds, typically set aside to cater for elective surgery that does not go as planned, will now be occupied by swelling numbers of Covid patients. “The entire January and February will be an absolute whitewash” for elective surgery in NSW, another senior Sydney doctor predicted. “This is a real crisis,” the doctor said. “There’s going to be triage medicine” with doctors having to determine which patients have their treatment delayed even if they are in pain from ailments such as hernias or “not-super-urgent cancer”. Current hospitalisations, now at about 1600 in NSW, could rise to 4500-5000, the doctor said. While the NSW government had erred in easing Covid restrictions in mid-December before reintroducing some of them, there was still time to encourage greater mask wearing, social distancing or other steps to at least slow the coming deluge of hospital admissions, the doctor said. Continuing to “let it rip” was not a wise approach. The senior NSW medical official said the whole national and state policy relied on the assumption high Covid vaccination rates would mean there wouldn’t be “a serious rise in hospital admissions due to Covid”. Recent NSW figures estimate 70% of patients in hospital had the Delta variant, and about 60% were unvaccinated. As Omicron is much more contagious than Delta and so would infect many more people, it remains to be seen how an already exhausted health system will cope with the coming spike in hospitalisations. “That’s the gamble that we’re all collectively involved in at the moment,” the offical said.

1/7/2022,"Norfolk Island is experiencing its first Covid outbreak, with spiralling case numbers forcing more than 10% of the population into isolation and raising concerns about the local health system’s reliance on medical evacuations. Deep in the Pacific Ocean, the external Australian territory about 1,500km off the coast of the mainland had gone the duration of the pandemic without recording any local Covid transmission, until the final days of last year.  On 30 December, its first cases of Covid were recorded, weeks after the territory reopened to tourists from Queensland and New South Wales where Covid transmission has soared. Less than a week later, 35 locals have now tested positive for the virus, with more than 200 of the island’s roughly 2,000 residents forced to isolate. In response, authorities have suspended tourism again, initially for two weeks, to allow its health system “to manage the current level of Covid cases in the community without additional cases from visitors arriving on the island”. As most PCR tests have to be sent to labs offshore, the majority of diagnoses are via rapid antigen tests. The prominent variant on the island has yet to be confirmed, though authorities say it appears to be the Omicron strain. More than 95% of the population has received two doses of Covid vaccine. However, a local resident with knowledge of the health system raised concerns about the capacity for local treatment, and a lack of a contingency plan if the outbreak worsens. “People will end up dying probably. It’s a pity that it had to end up this way. They had two years to prepare,” the resident, who did not want to be named given the island’s small population, said. Norfolk’s only hospital has just seven beds – one of which can be used for patients requiring acute care and ventilation – and the small health practice shares a building with the island’s only aged care facility. There is just one permanent doctor on the island. “The hospital was built in the 1940s, and it looks and runs like it was built in the 1940s,” the resident said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The median age of residents at the 2016 census was 49, compared to the national average of 38. The resident said many suffer from existing health conditions. More than 32.6% of the population is older than 60. “It’s a very vulnerable population … and once they’ve got an infection in the hospital, they won’t have any hospital for non-Covid patients. It’s also a problem because it’s next to aged care, and once it gets in there it’s like a death sentence,” said the resident with knowledge of the health system. “Medevacs” to the mainland are frequent for broken limbs and other common injuries, and happen “at the drop of a hat” when conditions worsen, the resident said. Evacuations range from approximately $35,000 to $80,000 per medevac, a department of infrastructure spokeswoman said. Since Norfolk Island lost the right to self-governance when the Australian government abolished its parliament in 2015, health and education services had been supported by New South Wales. However, from 1 January this transitioned to Queensland, meaning that medical evacuations will now take residents to be treated in that state.

But he suggested the island would not rely on evacuations as the Omicron variant of Covid stretches hospitals on the mainland. “We do realise that at the moment, a number of hospitals [on the mainland] have their own challenges. We’re trying to avoid medical evacuation,” Hutchinson said. For now, Queensland Health is providing remote care to Covid patients isolating in their home on the island, in what is termed a “virtual hospital”. None are in the hospital, which Hutchinson said was because authorities were trying to avoid admitting patients due to the proximity of beds to the aged care facility. “That obviously presents a risk.” Hutchinson acknowledged the island’s vulnerability to the virus, but insisted that preparations over the past 18 months had put it in a better position to respond. “It’s quite evident that what is happening on mainland Australia is justifiably concerning for the people of Norfolk, as we are an isolated community with limited medical resources and an older population.” He also acknowledged that while there were plans for a new hospital in coming years, the island’s current facility meant the community was “still dealing with old infrastructure” when they access healthcare. However, Hutchinson stressed that “at this point in time we’re alert, not alarmed”. It is also understood that some in the community – specifically descendants of Bounty Mutineers and their Tahitian brides who settled on Norfolk from Pitcairn Island – are reluctant to leave the island for medical evacuation because they want to be buried there. Hutchinson acknowledged this connection many residents have, but suggested this was no different to other parts of regional and remote Australia. “If in the unfortunate event somebody has to be taken off the island for treatment, their bodies would be repatriated,” he said. Guardian Australia contacted Metro North Health, the section of Queensland Health that provides assistance to Norfolk Island with questions about contingency plans for the island if the outbreak deteriorates. A spokeswoman said it is continuing to monitor high risk patients remotely and provide advice for local public health measures. “Metro North Health will continue to support Norfolk Island as required, with medical evacuations to the mainland set to continue if needed.”",News/Australia news,‘Very vulnerable’: first Covid outbreak in Norfolk Island raises concerns about health system,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/07/very-vulnerable-first-covid-outbreak-in-norfolk-island-raises-concerns-about-health-system
1/7/2022,"Novak Djokovic’s wrangling with authorities over entering Australia has inadvertently highlighted a different plight: those of the refugees and asylum seekers stuck for months, and years, at the Park Hotel. The infamous detention hotel in Carlton, Melbourne, where the tennis star is likely to spend the weekend as he awaits a court hearing over his visa cancellation has been described detainees as a “torture cell”.  “There is no fresh air, there was recently a fire, the food is not great, we do not have access to a gym, the hotel is totally locked up,” 38-year-old Jamal Mohamed tells Guardian Australia. “I am suffering each and every day. I have nightmares every night, all I want is freedom. It’s really terrible, I don’t know one person here who feels good about it.” Mehdi, a refugee who has spent nine years in detention, told Guardian Australia: “There is a disappointment: everyone wants to ask me about Novak, what the hotel is like for him. But they don’t ask about us: we have been locked up in this place for months, for years. “I’ve never seen so many cameras, so much attention. I hope Novak Djokovic learns about our situation here, and I hope he speaks about it.” The Australian Border Force has been using Carlton’s Park Hotel in Melbourne as an ad-hoc detention centre for refugees since December 2020. Many of the refugees and asylum seekers have been held in detention for up to nine years, with the Park Hotel only their most recent location after being transported from Nauru for medical reasons. The vast majority of those still detained in the hotel – commandeered as an ‘alternative place of detention’ by the federal government – were brought to Australia in 2019 from offshore processing islands under the short-lived medevac laws. That means doctors judged they required urgent medical attention for serious conditions. Most have not received the medical care they require. Jamal Mohamed said conditions had worsened in the time he had been there. “It’s like a torture cell. I would definitely call it torture,” he said. In late December, reports emerged of meals with maggots and mouldy bread was being served to detainees, with some reportedly getting sick from the food. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Several fires also broke out in December, leading to the refugees being evacuated and one person taken to hospital with smoke inhalation. Ishmael, another refugee detained at the hotel, said he and his fellow refugees have been “treated badly” at the hotel, and says he feels he is “losing his mind” there. “We’ve been held in a place that has no sunlight at all, no fresh air, no where to move, and we spend 23 hours a day in a single room with no windows, and we don’t know how long we will be kept here.” “We’ve been sick, both physically and mentally.” When he heard about Djokovic’s arrival, he said the tennis star was “lucky” he won’t be treated like them. “We know they want to send a message, with Djokovic’s arrival, that they have a strong border that is fair to everyone. But it hasn’t been fair for nine years. They differentiate between people based on class, some people from developed countries have never been detained. “So now they want to send that message, but it’s not true, and it has never been true, they have discriminated against people who come by boat, the most vulnerable people who don’t have another option.” The Park Hotel was the centre of a Covid outbreak in October and November almost half of the people detained there tested positive for Covid. At least one was taken to hospital by ambulance. But even before it was a detention centre, under its former name, Rydges, the hotel was used for hotel quarantine and was the centre of Victoria’s second Covid wave. Joy, another refugee detained at the hotel, called it a “torture centre,” saying he has been there for two years for “no reason.” “Freedom is beautiful for human beings. Novak Djokovic may be held for nine hours or nine days. But we have been medically abused.” “We are discriminated against because we came by boat, not plane. There was no caring. We came for safety, not to play tennis. It’s not sporting or fair.” “Please, we want our freedom.” A government inquiry found “around 90 per cent of Covid-19 cases in Victoria since late May 2020 were attributable to the outbreak at Rydges”. Rydges was removed from the Victorian hotel quarantine program, the government inquiry found: “insufficient regard was paid to infection prevention and control standards across the entire program and, particularly, to that location”. “There were consistent themes in the evidence and information provided to the Inquiry about concerns regarding matters including: access to fresh air; access to good quality food; the state of cleanliness of the facility.” The 107-room hotel, on Swanston Street, was bought by the Pelligra Group in September 2020 for $35m, and its name changed from Rydges to Park.",News/Australia news,Novak Djokovic: refugees hope tennis star’s hotel detention will cast light on their ‘torture’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/07/novak-djokovic-refugees-hope-tennis-stars-hotel-detention-will-cast-light-on-their-torture
1/7/2022,"General practitioners say they are being given a “laughable” supply of vaccine for the rollout to children, warning they will struggle to inoculate them ahead of the return to school in February. Parents across Sydney and Melbourne are also complaining of either having long-held bookings cancelled or being prevented from making appointments for their children due to system glitches.  The rollout of the Pfizer vaccine to 2.3m children aged 5-11 begins on Monday, leaving families with a tight window to secure bookings before the school year starts in late January or early February. This week, vaccine taskforce head Lt Gen John Frewen said Australia had enough supply to administer first doses for every child “either within January or in the early weeks of February”. But GPs, who make up one of the main distribution channels, say they are facing similar problems to those experienced in the botched early stages of the adult rollout early last year. Dose allocations are too low to allow for rapid, widespread vaccination, and there has been confusion among GPs on whether shipments will arrive prior to Monday’s start date. In Melbourne, Dr Shea Wilcox says his clinic has been promised just 100 doses a week for children. The clinic says it could administer 1,000 doses per week. They have been overwhelmed with parents desperately seeking appointments ahead of the school year. “People are just phoning us saying ‘the prime minister is saying that there are doses, we want those’. We’re saying ‘we have no doses’,” he said. “One hundred doses per week is laughable. What’s that, about 30 families with three children each?” GPs placed orders for vaccine doses in mid-December but are being told shipments will only begin arriving late this week, just days out from the rollout’s commencement. That leaves little room for error. Any delay to shipments would force Wilcox and others to cancel bookings made for Monday. “We don’t have any vaccines in the fridge for children, parents are getting increasingly anxious with the case numbers going up, and the government is saying there are vaccines,” he said. Dr Maria Boulton, a GP and clinic owner in Brisbane, has also been allocated just 100 doses per week, which won’t begin arriving until 14 January, two to three weeks before most schools generally return for the year. Her clinic has 1,500 child patients aged 5-11. On the current dose allocation, it would take more than three months for her to vaccinate them all. The same supply and distribution issues were experienced by GP clinics during the early stages of the adult vaccination program last year. Still scarred by that experience, Boulton’s clinic hasn’t been taking appointments until she has the doses in her hands. Asked whether the government had learnt the lessons of that experience, Boulton said: “No. Once again, communication with GPs has been very poor by the health officials, and we tend to find things out through the media.” Boulton said rising Covid case numbers meant she would be operating with a reduced workforce, as staff were either infected or isolating. Dr Mukesh Haikerwal, who practises in Melbourne’s west, told Guardian Australia his clinic currently had 200 doses to vaccinate 1,400 eligible children. At the same time, he was dealing with the loss of 19 staff members and added pressure due to the clinic’s provision of Covid testing. “We also have business as usual to try and manage. Still there are many and massive problems,” he said via text. The Victorian spokesperson for the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, Dr Anita Munoz, said the lack of doses being delivered to GPs was a significant issue. “It is frustrating for GPs,” she told Guardian Australia. “We would definitely like to see more doses with each delivery.” She said the sector was under enormous pressure at the moment, due to the adult booster program, high Covid-19 case numbers, workforce strains, and business as usual, all on top of the the children’s vaccination program. Asked if GPs would be able to vaccinate children before the return of school, she said: “I have concerns about getting all the kids vaccinated before then. I’m not sure it’s going to happen.” A spokesperson for health minister Greg Hunt said 2m doses of Pfizer for children had been tested by the Therapeutic Goods Administration and was being distributed to primary care and state clinics. “Operation COVID Shield advises all orders are on track to be delivered as scheduled and advised to providers,” the spokesperson said. “The government has secured sufficient supply of the 5-11 year doses to offer all children a first dose by the end of January. Week by week allocations depends on ordering rates by individual vaccine providers.” The various booking systems for children’s vaccinations are also experiencing problems. Prof Alexandra Martiniuk, an epidemiologist at the University of Sydney, booked her children in for their vaccinations at the earliest opportunity last year. Both were to receive their first doses at the Mona Vale vaccination hub in Sydney in the first week of the rollout. Two days ago, she was told all appointments at the Mona Vale vaccination hub were being cancelled, and that she would have to find open bookings elsewhere for her children. That effectively put her at the back of the queue, despite her having a family member vulnerable to Covid-19. She asked NSW Health whether there was any triaging of vaccinations to prioritise more at-risk families. She was told there is no such strategy. “We are in a chaotic state, we all know that, with Omicron, on so many fronts, and this is one more front,” she told Guardian Australia. “But the thing is we knew child vaccinations were coming – we’ve known it for months.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Initially, she could only secure an appointment in March at the earliest.

1/7/2022,"Official government advice prepared almost a year ago warned that widespread community transmission could see testing sites overwhelmed and “alternative testing methods”, including rapid antigen testing, could help alleviate pressure. Amid growing criticism of the government’s handling of the testing regime in the face of the surging Omicron variant, archived advice shows that health officials were warning federal and state governments of a scenario in which testing sites could not cope as far back as February last year.A “testing framework strategy” prepared by the Communicable Disease Network of Australia (CDNA) and the Public Health Laboratory Network (PHLN) in February 2021 modelled three epidemiological scenarios relating to the transmission of the virus, including one of high community transmission.  In this epidemiological scenario, community transmission is “placing burden on response capacity” and resulting in “testing demand exceeding laboratory and public health capacity.” The paper states that the “analytical performance and possible uses” of rapid antigen tests is being “evaluated as a matter of urgency”, but the group’s position is that those tests are useful in limited settings, such as when there is a strong chance of a positive result. “For example in an outbreak setting or where community transmission is established.” “In this epidemiological scenario, in addition to use for public health investigation purposes, this technology (rapid antigen tests) may prove useful as a screening test for individuals in high risk settings … where the pre-test probability is high,” the advice states. “It offers rapid results in relevant settings, while reducing pressure on RT-PCR capacity.” The CDNA is a subcommittee of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, and was established to provide national public health coordination for the prevention and control of communicable diseases. The PHLN is a collaborative group of laboratories that provide public health microbiology services. The joint advice, which was prepared in consultation with the Doherty Institute, suggests that given the rapid development of new testing technology, Australia has “the opportunity to explore testing strategies that may be complementary to, although not a replacement for, the gold standard diagnostic test (the RT-PCR).” “Using alternative tests or testing methods may help conserve the capacity of the public and private laboratory systems,” a section of the advice marked “committee in confidence” says. The emergence of the February 2021 advice comes as the prime minister, Scott Morrison, continues to defend the government’s handling of the Omicron wave, that has seen testing clinics overwhelmed amid a national shortage of rapid antigen tests. The prime minister, who has flagged that shortages will continue for a couple of weeks, said the federal government had secured adequate supplies of rapid antigen tests to fulfil its responsibilities, and states were responsible for securing their own supplies. He rejected suggestions the federal government was unprepared for the current outbreak. “There are plenty of armchair critics and people who say what could have been, but those who actually are doing it every day and the health officials who have responsibility for it every day, those who are regulating vaccines, which have very profound implications for people’s health … I don’t accept the suggestion that they haven’t been doing the job,” Morrison said. “I think they’ve been doing their job extremely well and under extraordinary pressure in a very uncertain environment. “There’s no guidebook to Covid. We all know that. And so I what I think is important is the country just focuses on the task ahead.” The CDNC and PHLN paper also discussed potential barriers to Australia’s testing regime, suggesting that Australia only has the capability and capacity to meet “the current testing demands”. “However, laboratories’ maximum daily throughput cannot increase without: procuring new platforms; training new skilled medical laboratory scientists (and) identifying additional laboratory space.” It also highlights the concerns about workforce constraints that are now being experienced, saying it “can easily come under significant pressure in times of increased testing.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Several laboratories across Australia are currently operating 24 hours a day, seven days per week. This requires laboratory staff to work 12–14 hour shifts at a time. Workforce contingency planning in the event of increased testing demand should include planning for these workforces.” Despite the discussion of scenarios where testing demand increases, the paper suggests that the “continuity of supply into the Australian market of tests and reagents for the primary Covid-19 tests in use is assured.” “The Australian government has also invested in securing a strategic reserve of pathology supplies should international supply lines be compromised.” A separate paper on rapid antigen tests that was first published in October 2020 and has been twice updated, outlines many of the limitations of the tests compared to PCR testing, and says the tests should only be used in limited circumstances. “However, significant changes in epidemiology may trigger a move to wider deployment of these devices to augment the current laboratory-based systems,” the August 2021 paper says. The paper also suggests that a protocol for reporting test numbers be established if rapid antigen tests are used, with each jurisdiction then reporting case numbers to the federal government. Despite the early advice that such a reporting mechanism may be needed when rapid antigen tests are in use, states and territories are now scrambling to come up with a reporting system for use by the end of the month. On Thursday, the Victorian government announced a new system obliging anyone who returns a positive rapid test to register the result. Morrison said that case numbers, which topped 64,000 on Thursday were becoming less important. “What matters is how many people are in hospital, ICU and on ventilators and that’s the real measure of what the impact is,” Morrison said. “The real issue is that people are connected to care.”",News/Australia news,Australian government was warned about Covid testing overburden almost a year ago,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/07/australian-government-was-warned-about-covid-testing-overburden-almost-a-year-ago
