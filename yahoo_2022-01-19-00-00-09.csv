1/19/2022,"The international community is closely monitoring the Taliban, after the group re-seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021. There is legitimate reason for concern. The Taliban are again ruling through fear and draconian rules. The Taliban’s last regime, in the mid-1990s, was marked by human rights violations, including massacres, mass detentions and rape. The regime collapsed on Nov. 14, 2001, shortly after the U.S. launched its global war on terrorism. Even after the Taliban officially fell from power, their subsequent two decades of insurgency produced various gross human rights violations, an encompassing term under international human rights law. When the Taliban regained control over Afghanistan last year, some outside observers speculated that an evolved version of the group might materialize. These spectators assumed that the Taliban recognized it cannot govern merely with fear and bans. Many Afghan people still expressed widespread fear and skepticism about the Taliban’s return. The Taliban have now been in power for almost five months. A clearer image of the human rights and personal freedoms situation in Afghanistan is emerging. As political science professors specializing in conflict and violence, we find that the Taliban’s changes are limited to international public relations campaigns on social media and other outlets. While promoting a moderate face to the world, with promises of living “peacefully” and respecting women’s rights, the regime has continued to systematically violate human rights and strengthen its autocratic grip. Theories about what experts called “Taliban 2.0” continued after the group assumed control over Afghanistan. Representatives from countries such as Turkey and Qatar encouraged the international community to engage with the Taliban. While international donors have frozen about $5 billion in foreign aid to Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover, some Western countries, including the U.S., have announced increases in aid to address the country’s humanitarian crisis. The Taliban have undertaken a systematic media crackdown to achieve their contradictory goals of presenting a softer face to the international community while violating Afghans’ rights. The group is forcing media to follow two of the Taliban’s dogmatic and moral regulatory bodies’ guidelines. The Taliban also announced the “11 journalism rules,” which include forbidding journalists from publishing or broadcasting stories that are “contrary to Islam” or “insult national figures.” About 40% of the country’s media sources have shut down, 6,400 journalists lost their jobs, including 84% of female journalists. Violence against media and journalists has again become widespread. Many other journalists have left the country. The media crackdown has a practical reason: limiting the flow of information about the regime’s continued rights violations. United Nations human rights experts say they have received credible reports of the Taliban killing civilians, as well as hundreds of former Afghanistan security personnel across the country. The Taliban have shown gruesome hangings of dead bodies and stoning of people to death. Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation has deteriorated under the Taliban. Approximately 23 million Afghans are facing hunger, including 3.2 million children who are suffering from severe malnutrition. The Taliban leadership denies any responsibility for alleviating the looming humanitarian crisis. In November 2021, Taliban Prime Minister Mullah Hasan rejected the regime’s responsibility for food insecurity in Afghanistan and asked people to “cry to God to alleviate famine and drought.” Anas Haqqani, a senior member of the Taliban negotiation team in Doha, also downplayed the seriousness of the looming hunger crisis by rhetorically asking a BBC reporter if she had ever witnessed someone dying of hunger. The Taliban’s conduct toward girls and women also reveals a return to previous ways. The Taliban has banned women from traveling more than 72 kilometers from home without a male relative. In early December, the Taliban released a decree saying a woman is a “noble and free human being” and should not be forced into a marriage. The international community largely welcomed the announcement. However, a closer look at the decree reveals that the Taliban formalizes the regime’s right to determine whether a woman actually consents to a union. The Taliban have systematically reinstated old restrictions on girls education and female employment. While most primary girls schools are closed across the country, secondary and tertiary education remains completely banned for girls. In 2017, U.N. Children’s Fund figures showed that 3.7 million Afghan children were out of school, 60% of them girls. This percentage is now likely much greater with the Taliban’s ban on girls education. This differs from the Taliban’s recent public messaging on girls’ and women’s “right to education and work.” [The Conversation’s Politics + Society editors pick need-to-know stories. Sign up for Politics Weekly.] To the domestic audience, the regime’s messages are vague. Leaders condition reopening girls education, for example, to unclear economic and moral conditions. Deputy Prime Minister Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar said recently that once “economic challenges are resolved, we will provide education for all those who want to pursue their studies.” The Taliban have also banned most female government workers from returning to their jobs, resulting in a workforce restriction that would result in economic losses totaling $1 billion. The only indication of a “new Taliban” is a much more sophisticated and strategic public relations approach for masking ongoing human rights violations.

1/19/2022,"(This Jan 17 story corrects spelling error in last paragraph) MADRID (Reuters) - World men's tennis No. 1 Novak Djokovic will have to comply with Spanish health rules to be able to travel to Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Monday. Answering a question on whether Djokovic would be allowed to enter Spain to compete after Australia deported him for being unvaccinated against COVID-19, Sanchez said: ""Any sportsperson who wishes to compete in our country must comply with the health rules of Spain"". German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who was visiting Spain on Monday and stood beside Sanchez during the news conference, also insisted the different rules in the different countries must be respected. ""We all have to abide by them, no matter who we are,"" he said. Djokovic travels regularly to Spain where he owns a house in the southern resort of Marbella. He spent a few days in late December and early January and video footage showed him training there. Spanish rules currently require people to have either a vaccine certificate, a PCR negative test or a certificate of having recovered from COVID. The country imposes strict quarantines on people who test positive. During the same news conference, the Spanish Prime Minister made an impassioned call for vaccination. Even though vaccination is not mandatory in Spain, the vaccination rate is one of the highest in Europe.

1/19/2022,"By Subrat Patnaik    (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Tuesday it was acquiring ""Call of Duty"" videogame maker Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in cash, the biggest deal in the sector that would help the Xbox maker become the third-largest gaming company by revenue.    Microsoft's offer of $95 per share is at a premium of 45% to Activision's Friday close. Shares of Activision were trading at $89.55 in trading before the bell.    ""Gaming is the most dynamic and exciting category in entertainment across all platforms today and will play a key role in the development of metaverse platforms,"" Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said in a statement.    Microsoft has been making big investments in gaming, scooping up ""Minecraft"" maker Mojang Studios and Zenimax in multi-billion dollar deals in recent years.    Activision's library of games such as ""Call of Duty"" and ""Overwatch"" gives Microsoft's Xbox gaming platform an edge over Sony's Playstation, which has for years enjoyed a more steady stream of exclusive games.    Shares of the ""Candy Crush"" maker have slumped over 37% since hitting their record high last year, largely hurt by allegations of sexual harassment and other misconduct at the videogame company.    The company is still addressing those allegations and said on Monday it had fired or pushed out more than three dozen employees and disciplined another 40 since July.    Bobby Kotick will continue to serve as CEO of Activision Blizzard.    The sector is consolidating with larger firms buying up smaller players in recent years.    Last week, ""Grand Theft Auto"" video game maker Take-Two Interactive said it would buy Zynga for $11.04 billion in a cash-and-stock deal that will add popular mobile titles such as ""FarmVille"" under its umbrella as demand surges for on-the-go gaming.    (Reporting by Subrat Patnaik, Ankur Banerjee, Eva Mathews and Uday Sampath in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva) ",Business/Reuters,Microsoft to buy 'Call of Duty' maker for $68.7 billion in gaming push,https://news.yahoo.com/microsoft-buy-activision-blizzard-deal-132807428.html
1/19/2022,"A 42-acre parcel of land briefly used as an air force base north of Gettysburg is on the market with an asking price of $4.5 million. Property owner Lev Goukassian, a retired businessman who said he ran a computer company, posted the property sale on Facebook marketplace recently with an asking price of just under $1 million. But by Friday, the asking price had jumped to $4.5 million. Goukassian said he's been surprised by the offers he's received, including one international inquiry at the initial asking price. Goukassian, who purchased the property in 2007, according to Potter County property records, lives in California. Instead of investing in stock, he said he invested in multiple pieces of property. While photos of the property reveal buildings that are showing their age, Goukassian said the base buildings have strong walls and some unique features, including underground tunnels that connect them. The base is listed as having 50 beds and 15 bathrooms. According to history written about the site on Fortwiki and Wikipedia, the Gettysburg Air Force Station was used from 1956 to 1968 as a radar station. Gettysburg was one of 28 sites selected for a radar surveillance network. While the base is no longer active, the Federal Aviation Administration continues to operate a radar site on the property. Goukassian said he's not sure he wants to sell, but if he does, he'd prefer to sell to someone from the Gettysburg area.
