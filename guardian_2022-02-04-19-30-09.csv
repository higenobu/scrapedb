2/4/2022,"Mahamat-Saleh Haroun is the Chadian film-maker whose 2002 movie Abouna – my favourite of his – has a claim to classic status. Now he returns with a film that is recognisably a part of African cinema’s quietist walking-pace tradition, set in a place where, on its outskirts, the city becomes a village. The two distant ambient sounds are barnyard chickens and incessant traffic noise. Yet for all its ostensible gentleness, his storytelling is driven by a need to challenge the country’s reactionary theocratic males. There are fierce and even shocking stabs of sexuality and violence cutting through the opaque, stoic calm. The title Lingui is the Chadian word meaning sacred bonds, and on the question of abortion, the male rulers of church and state think the really sacred bond is between mother and unborn child, or perhaps more pertinently, between submissive women and autocratic menfolk. But the men’s opposition to abortion co-exists with an enormous enthusiasm for female genital mutilation. The film shows that they are two halves of a whole, and the women involved feel that their sacred bonds are those of loyalty to each other.  Amina is a single mother who has to pretend that her husband is dead; in fact, she was made pregnant by a man who simply deserted her. Now she makes a living creating wire stoves out of reclaimed materials, chiefly the circular wiring inside discarded tyres. It is a strong and charismatic performance from Achouackh Abakar, whose calmly assertive face is repeatedly captured in extreme closeup. Her teenage daughter Maria is a smart, popular pupil at the local high school, but she has just been expelled for being pregnant, without a word of concern from the hatchet-faced and disapproving headteacher. Rihane Khalil Alio gives a performance of defiant scorn as Maria. Wretched Amina is horrified at the thought of her daughter having an abortion, because she feels the need to conform to religious teachings, and placate the local imam. But the film shows how she is also wretched at another thought: the feeling that, yes, Maria is quite right; that this is her body and that she should be allowed to do what she wants. This thought complicates the already fraught mother-daughter relationship, as Amina was in this situation herself not so long ago. Now Amina must consider how far she is prepared to go, how far she is prepared to abase herself to get her daughter the abortion she wants. All of this is to bring the two women into contact with Amina’s estranged sister Fanta (Briya Gomdigue), whose own daughter is threatened with FGM, and their middle-aged male neighbour Brahim (Youssouf Djaoro), who has made a proposition of marriage to the deeply ambivalent Amina. In its way, Lingui is about the idea of community and people looking out for each other. But this is a secret community of women, a community that exists beneath or beyond the official community presided over by the imam, who is forever coldly hectoring Amina for not coming to the mosque and for not confiding her problems to him (Amina is far too shrewd to do anything of the sort). It is the figure of Amina’s unromantic but well-off suitor, Brahim, who is to be the nexus of all this: is this to be their way out, or another unsacred bond tying mother and daughter to their servitude? The intense, focused performances from the two central women keep this drama in a hyper-alert state: we are intensely aware of all that is at stake and how mother and daughter are battling for survival, and teetering on a precipice of unacknowledged shame. I am not entirely sure that Haroun entirely absorbs into the drama the shocking act of violence, with all its necessary consequences. But the sheer seriousness and urgency of the deceptively unhurried story give it power.

2/4/2022,"Thousands of demonstrators are expected to hit Brazil’s streets on Saturday to protest against the murder of a young Congolese refugee whose killing – captured in spine-chilling video footage – has caused an explosion of anger over deep-rooted structural racism and hate violence. Moïse Mugenyi Kabagambe abandoned his home in the conflict-stricken city of Bunia, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 11 years ago after his grandmother was killed. He sought shelter thousands of miles away in Brazil only to lose his own life last week, aged 24, after being set upon by a group of men on one of Rio’s best-known beaches, Barra da Tijuca.  Relatives say Kabagambe had gone there to demand 200 reais (£28) in unpaid wages from the seaside bar where he had worked informally as a waiter serving beach-goers. Kabagambe sustained fatal chest injuries after being knocked to the ground and battered dozens of times with pieces of wood and fists. His hands and feet were reportedly bound after he was knocked unconscious. One local newspaper ran images of the ferocious 24 January assault – which occurred just metres from some of Rio’s most exclusive beachfront hotels and condos – on its front page under the headline: “Cowardice. Savagery. Barbarity.” “My cousin never hurt anyone, he was always smiling. It’s abhorrent. It’s a nightmare,” said his cousin, Chadrac Kembilu Nkusu, a fellow refugee who is considering fleeing to Canada because of the attack. “Brazil is a mother, a country that embraces everyone. I cannot understand how this mother could have killed a son as good as Moïse,” Nkusu added. So far three men have been arrested for a crime that has sparked a wave of revulsion from campaigners, politicians and celebrities. “Brazil is a dangerous country for us black people. Beware!” tweeted Preto Zezé, a prominent black activist and impresario. A supreme court judge, Gilmar Mendes, said the “deplorable scenes of hatred and barbarity” exposed the dangers of intolerance, racism and xenophobia. On Saturday morning civil rights activists and citizens will rally at the crime scene, while demonstrations are also planned in cities including São Paulo, Recife, Belo Horizonte and Porto Alegre. Douglas Belchior, a leader from the Coalizão Negra Por Direitos network which is helping organize protests, said: “The barbaric murder of black people is shamefully commonplace in Brazil … Here we have a George Floyd every 23 minutes. We have a Moïse every 23 minutes. We are constantly being killed.” Wiping tears from his eyes, Belchior spurned the notion that his country offered a safe sanctuary for black refugees. “The image we sell of Brazil is a lie. It’s not true that we are a mother who offers shelter. Brazil is a country of race war. What’s happening here is a war – black people die every single day. It is a state of terror – and we have to expose this.” Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, who owns a home a few minutes’ walk from the murder scene, has remained silent over Kabagambe’s killing – although he did find time to wade into the row over Spotify and Covid misinformation. “Stand your ground! Hugs from Brazil,” Bolsonaro tweeted at the controversial podcast host Joe Rogan on Thursday. But the former leftist president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, condemned the “cowardly murder”. “This isn’t normal. This isn’t human. It’s the result of a country that is being governed by a fascist,” Lula said, blaming Bolsonaro’s radical administration for the climate of violence. Activists believe the roots of Kabagambe’s murder run much deeper, describing the killing as part of slavery’s malignant legacy in a country that received nearly 5 million enslaved people from Africa. Belchior said: “Brazil is a country built on slavery. It’s the country that endured slavery for the longest, was the last in the Americas to abolish it – and the way Brazilian society was organized post-slavery was designed to perpetuate the social dynamic by which black people were subjected to the slave owners’s way of thinking.” Wesley Teixeira, a Rio-based activist and educator who will attend Saturday’s protest, said the murder exposed “the open wound of slavery”. Teixeira voiced bewilderment nobody had intervened to stop the attack: “Brazilian society sees a black body splayed out on the floor, dead, and carries on drinking … as if it’s all completely normal.” Belchior said all of Brazilian society – rather than just black people and movements – needed to mobilize if such killings were to be stopped. “There wouldn’t be space in the news for any other topic if this was a white person from Europe or the US. But it was an African person from the Congo – so no sweat,” he said. “This is sickening and it is intolerable. I feel great anger, but sadness too – because there is nothing to suggest that very soon the same thing won’t happen again.”",News/World news,‘A George Floyd every 23 minutes’: fury at refugee’s brutal murder at Rio beach,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/04/brazil-congolese-refugee-murder-racism
2/4/2022,"Over the 17 days of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, more than 70% of the American population tuned in to watch on NBC, which has owned the exclusive US broadcast rights since 1988. The official audience figure of 215m domestic viewers far exceeded guarantees to advertisers and represented the apotheosis of the network’s star-driven storytelling ethos under longtime NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol, one of the last high-profile sports TV impresarios. But as the Olympics return to the Chinese capital less than 14 years on, the awareness and general buzz around the Games stateside, while impossible to quantify with any precision, has never felt lower. Despite a star-studded US Olympic team filled with established champions and promising newcomers that will march into the National Stadium during Friday’s opening ceremony and pile up medals in the weeks to come, the outcome could be a commercial nadir that makes the underwhelming ratings from last year’s Tokyo Games seem like a fond memory.  Why that is is down to a constellation of factors. The athletes pushed by NBC as the faces of the Beijing Winter Games – alpine skier Mikaela Shiffrin, figure skater Nathan Chen, cross-country skier Jessie Diggins, snowboarders Shaun White and Chloe Kim – are no less accomplished or advertiser-friendly than previous headliners. But the network is finding that no amount of promotional willpower is enough if Coca-Cola, Visa, Procter & Gamble and co aren’t doing their part. The corporate sponsors that typically go big on the Olympics have kept their distance in the run-up amid global condemnation for the host country’s human-rights abuses against Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in far western Xinjiang – which the US state department has labelled a genocide – in addition to the persecution of Tibetans and the repression of Hong Kong’s freedoms. Those thorny geopolitical implications were only underscored when the US, Australia, Britain and Canada announced a diplomatic boycott of the event last month. Only two of the 20 official Team USA sponsors had aired spots pegged to the Olympics as of Wednesday, according to Reuters, with both focusing on the athletes while downplaying the host nation. That’s a far cry from the flood-the-zone deluge that’s critical to breaking through and building anticipation for athletes and sports that are largely in the public eye only once every four years. Bottom line: many casual sports fans, perhaps thrown off by an Olympics taking place only seven months after the last one due to the coronavirus postponement, are barely aware a Winter Games is even happening. A third straight Olympics staged in the inhospitable time zones of east Asia was always going to present a challenge for NBC, which paid $7.75bn for broadcast rights through 2032 before Beijing was awarded this year’s affair. But the network’s broadcast choices in response have been strewn with unforced errors, not least its famously byzantine Tokyo coverage spread across two broadcast channels, a half-dozen cable channels and multiple digital platforms, that managed to estrange curious passers-by while baffling even dedicated fans who knew what they’re looking for but couldn’t easily seek it out. Perhaps the most glaring example surrounded the women’s team gymnastics final, which took place in prime time in Japan. Even as most of America woke up to a flurry of push notifications and breaking news alerts that spread word of Simone Biles’ shocking withdrawal due to mental health issues, NBC and its affiliate stations throughout the country went through the day as if one of the biggest global stories in any sport last year wasn’t unfolding in a risible effort to preserve its primetime audience – a decision better suited to Tokyo 1964 than Tokyo 2020. By failing to update a hidebound model for a media ecosystem dominated by streaming services and social media, NBC risks letting one of the most lucrative properties in all of sports drift toward irrelevance. Avoiding last summer’s missteps in Beijing would be a good start. The Olympics are, like all major sporting spectacles these days, fundamentally a made-for-TV event. The spaces where the competitions take place are often so outfitted with cameras, lighting and equipment they can feel like television studios as much as sporting venues. But the empty stadiums that hosted the Tokyo Games, a precaution that Beijing will mostly follow, laid bare the importance of live crowds to the overall package. The quality of coverage will be further undercut by the scaling-back of resources on the ground due to coronavirus concerns and China’s strict quarantine policies. ESPN’s decision to not send reporters to Beijing was not a big deal as it tends to ignore the Olympics even in normal years, but NBC’s announcement that it would broadcast all events remotely and have only a skeleton crew on the ground raised eyebrows. This sense of detachment can also be felt on the ground in the days before the opening ceremony. With all participants from athletes to media members having entered a closed loop that completely separates them from the general public since arriving in China, the result is a sort of panopticon-like effect, as if you’re experiencing the city from behind a window. All of it adds up to the same lack of atmosphere, emotion and human connection that diminished the Tokyo Games as a spectacle through no fault of the athletes themselves. Just as the decision to allow NBA players to participate in the Olympics ahead of the 1992 Barcelona Games whipped up interest among meat-and-potatoes US sports fans whose interests are bound to the four major North American leagues, the inclusion of NHL players at the Winter Games has proven a key draw for casual audiences. That was never more evident than at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics when Canada faced off with the United States in the gold medal game. More than 26.7m people in the US – and roughly half the Canadian population – watched the Americans force overtime on Zach Parise’s last-minute goal before Sidney Crosby’s epochal overtime winner provided arguably the most indelible moment in the host nation’s Olympic history. But as the spread of the Omicron variant was laying waste to the NHL’s regular season last month, the league and its players’ union announced they would no longer be sending players to Beijing. The gutting of star power aside, the decision will have a disproportionate effect on the US and Canadian teams, whose rosters lean more heavily on NHL players than the traditional European powers. Some of the perception shift around the Olympics is simply elemental and larger than any one network or sporting event. The monoculture was dead and traditional network audiences fragmenting even before getting smashed to smithereens by the ascent of streaming services. People simply don’t watch TV like they used to, young people in particular. The Olympics is no longer event television, but neither are the Oscars. That reality is reflected in the most recent viewership figures. Last year’s Tokyo Games drew the smallest audience of any televised Olympics, with an average viewership of 15.5m in addition to cable and streaming outlets. The Pyeongchang Olympics three years earlier averaged 19.8m viewers, the lowest ever for a Winter Games. All signs indicate Beijing will struggle to better either mark. Of course none of that matters for the more than 150 members of the US team who have made the trip to China after years of self-sacrifice and discipline. The public apathy of the run-up will invariably turn to excitement as unexpected stars emerge and familiar names shine. But for the Olympics to command the American consciousness like when they last came to Beijing will require something extraordinary and unpredictable. Fortunately, that’s just what sport does best.

2/4/2022,"The hackAccording to users on TikTok, wearing a petroleum-based moisturiser under your perfume can make a scent last longer on your skin. The promiseFine fragrances can cost a fortune, and the more often you apply them, the more of your money evaporates into thin air. By smearing petroleum jelly on your neck before spritzing your perfume, you delay the drying-out process and there’s no need to reapply.  The testThere is logic here: scents don’t last as long on dry skin, and the alcohol that forms the base of most fragrances dries it out even more. Some schools of thought suggest applying an unscented moisturiser, then spritzing on top, but TikTok recommends using petroleum jelly instead. So in the morning I apply the jelly to one wrist but not the other, then spray my light floral fragrance on each. By the end of the day, after a sniff, the jellied wrist definitely has a stronger scent. The next day I take my investigation further, using deeper, wood-based notes that are known to last longest on the skin (the best contain oud, which is extracted from one of the most expensive woods in the world). I repeat the process. By the evening, the difference is marked – I even have it verified by a pal to check that I’m not losing my mind. The verdictThis was a cinch to try out.

2/4/2022,"Tony Colombo is one of the biggest names in neomelodica, an Italian music style combining elements of traditional Neapolitan song (think O Sole Mio) with modern pop influences. He has released more than 20 albums, held concerts across Italy, Germany, Canada and the US, and has hordes of fans. It is also alleged that part of his fortune comes from laundering money for the Camorra, the Neapolitan mafia , made famous through its depiction in Roberto Saviano’s book Gomorrah and its TV adaptation. On 21 December, the Italian police confiscated goods from Colombo including an apartment, two cars and €80,000 (£66,000). In 2019, Colombo married the widow of a Camorra boss and he has reportedly been seen at parties thrown by the Camorra; prosecutors believe he has received dirty money from his wife’s clan and attempted to pass them as proceeds from his music career. He has always denied any involvement with organised crime.  It isn’t an isolated case. Neomelodica singers are often accused of colluding with the Camorra – sometimes by their actions, sometimesthrough their music. And, as the authorities circle around Colombo, the Italian parliament is also discussing a law criminalising the glorification of the mob that seems specifically drafted to target some neomelodici. It somewhat mirrors other disputes across the globe. London drill rappers, for example, are censored by police fearful that their songs could instigate gang violence; Spanish rapper Pablo Hasel was arrested for glorifying terrorism and insulting the monarchy in his lyrics, while musicians led by Jay-Z argued this month for a change in New York law to mean lyrics cannot be used as criminal evidence. “These days, you go on TikTok and it’s all guns and money,” says Gianni Fiorellino, another popular neomelodici – who has no links to organised crime, but is dismayed at the idea his style could be censored. “I don’t see why that should be allowed and lyrics about organised crime should not.” Neomelodica was born in the 1980s as a reaction to societal change and the crisis of the canzone napoletana, the traditional, hyper-sentimental Neapolitan song (sometimes accompanied by mandolin or guitar) that bloomed in the early 19th century. By the 70s canzone napoletana had fallen out of fashion, and around the same period its hotbed, Naples, underwent a transformation, with the creation of neighbourhoods completely segregated from the city’s polite society. “In a way, neomelodica was to Naples what hip-hop was to America, it gave a voice to impoverished neighbourhoods,” says Marcello Ravveduto, a history professor at the University of Salerno. Whereas canzone napoletana was representing a picture-perfect, idealised Naples, neomelodici began depicting the harsh reality of its peripheries. Blending Neapolitan dialect with Italian, neomelodici sing of lost lovers and betrayal, teenage sex and divorce, drugs and broken homes. Some of them also sing of organised crime, a topic the fanbase would be familiar with, touching issues such as latitanza, mob soldiers going into hiding; and pentitismo, arrested mob soldiers collaborating with the police. “It’s a music rooted in the territory, with great melodies, where lyrics are central – they are like a mirror of Neapolitan sentiment,” says Fiorellino, who has released about 12 albums. Fiorellino is one of the few neomelodici who has performed in Italy’s most important music festival, Sanremo, but, aside from a few exceptions such as him and Gigi D’Alessio, Italy’s mainstream culture frowns upon neomelodica. For one, it is associated with urban poverty, while some neomelodica hits openly describe the Camorra, and more rarely the Sicilian Cosa Nostra. Tommy Riccio’s Nu’ Latitante is about hiding from justice, away from your family. Then there’s Lisa Castaldi’s Il Mio Amico Camorrista (My Camorra Friend), and Gianni Vezzosi’s ’O Killer or Carcere Minorile (Juvenile Prison). Ravveduto describes such songs as “a way to justify a way of being”. On one hand, those songs are critiques of society, and the way it pushes people toward crime; on the other, they take pride in otherness, and in resorting to violence to get what you want. Some view these songs as a propaganda tool for the mob, and this criticism has become more vocal. Before streaming, neomelodica used to be broadcast by small local radio stations, sometimes directly controlled by organised crime, but the internet has turned the genre into a near-national phenomenon. Last April, protests by anti-mafia activists forced Niko Pandetta to cancel a concert in Ostia, near Rome. Pandetta, a Sicilian who stands out for combining neomelodica with trap, is also the nephew of a prominent Cosa Nostra boss, Salvatore “Turi” Cappello. He dedicated his first hit to his uncle. The lawmaker Stefania Ascari has presented a bill that would make it illegal to glorify the mafia. She says she doesn’t want to target neomelodica as a genre, but only those artists “who are close to organised crime”, and points out that Camorra has exploited neomelodica to send veiled messages. For instance, two years ago, a group of mobsters detained in a high-security prison near Avellino shot a video to the beat of the song Si Sto’ Carcerato (The Inmate, by Tommy Riccio) to send the message that their clan stood strong, even behind bars. “Yes, I am an inmate, it was a life choice,” went the lyrics, as they waved to their families. “If you’re in a high-security prison and all detainees ask for neomelodica songs, you start wondering why,” says Ascari. Fiorellino is sceptical of the bill, even though it would not target his purely romantic songs. Ravveduto says the idea makes sense, at least in theory – “when songs glorify mafia powers, they should get them out of the market” – but in practice, he believes, there’s a risk that such a measure could turn into a boomerang. There’s a precedent in Mexico, where some northern states banned narcocorridos, the songs glorifying drug smugglers, and ended up turning them into the hymns for rebel youth. “If you crack down on music, you could end up providing the mob with new propaganda ammunition,” he says. “They could end up with even more leverage on the youth: ‘See, authorities don’t even let you express yourself.’”",Arts/Music,Neomelodica: the Italian pop loved by the mob and hated by the law,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/04/neomelodica-the-italian-pop-loved-by-the-mob-and-hated-by-the-law
2/4/2022,"In the tiny village of Martimporra (population 16), nestling among the lush green hills and valleys typical of Asturias, Orfelina Suárez, 58, runs a household goods shop. “If I was only allowed to speak Spanish I’d struggle with some vocabulary because I’m used to speaking Asturian,” she says.  “Without Asturian, life around here would be impossible. It’s not about geography, it’s more of an emotional terrain. You can’t underestimate the importance of a language that you speak and live and feel.” Martimporra is in Bimenes, a district where the Asturian language has officially enjoyed equal status with Spanish since 1998. Now the regional government proposes to extend this language parity throughout Asturias. Basque separatists laid down their arms more than 10 years ago and with the Catalan independence movement currently running out of steam, it seemed that Spain, a nation state at risk of unravelling along regional and linguistic lines, had stitched itself back together. But national unity could face its next challenge from this small and mainly rural region best known for its dairy products, cider and, until recently, coal mining. In October, up to 10,000 people marched through Oviedo, the Asturian capital, to demand an upgrade for the region’s language. Just how many of Asturias’ one million inhabitants speak Asturian daily is a moot point. Any Spanish speaker would find it easy to understand. While it has grammatical differences, many common verbs are either the same or vary only slightly: hacer (to do or make) is facer in Asturian; hablar (to talk) is falar. Many nouns differ only by a letter: harina (flour) is farina in Asturian; gato (cat) is gatu. As a spoken language, many argue that Asturian is little more than a Spanish dialect. But then, as others may counter, a language is simply a dialect with an army and navy. Spain already recognises four co-official languages – Catalan, Euskera (Basque), Galician and Aranés – each sharing equal status with Spanish in the region where it’s spoken. If Asturian joins their ranks, the other minority languages of Aragón, León and Extremadura, as well as the Spanish Gypsy languages Caló and Erromintxela, may demand similar treatment in a Spanish state already fractured along linguistic fault lines. Xosé Antón González is the president of the Asturian language academy, which has produced the standardised form of Asturian that will be implemented should the regional parliament vote to make it co-official. He says that Asturian is a language in its own right. “We’re realists,” he says. “We don’t have a problem with bilingualism. We know that Asturian is a small language that belongs to a small community of one million people and that Spanish will continue to be the main form of communication with the rest of the world. But without the sort of protection offered under the constitution it can’t survive.” Berta Piñán, the Asturian culture minister, argues that making the language co-official simply asserts speakers’ rights under the constitution. From that point on, “Asturias will be able to design its own language model based on rights rather than obligations”, she says. “Making it co-official is the only way to guarantee our freedom to express ourselves in Asturian,” says Inaciu Galán, an Asturian language activist who has compiled an Asturian-English dictionary. However, some Asturians fear the language will become politically weaponised, as is the case with Catalan, Euskera and, to a lesser extent, Galician. “It’s very sad the way it’s been politicised,” says Álvaro Queipo, secretary-general of the conservative People’s party in Asturias. “Now there is no debate, just emotion and posturing, dividing Asturians into the good, who want to make the language co-official, and the bad, who don’t.” González argues that language is a more fraught issue in Spain than in other European nations because Spain lurched from absolute monarchy into 40 years of fascist dictatorship with only a brief democratic interlude. A uniform idea of the nation was imposed without any recognition of significant regional differences. The other issue is nationalism. “The reason we have linguistic conflict in Spain is because the nationalists are linguistic nationalists, as in Québec,” says Mercè Vilarrubias, a linguist and advocate of bilingual education. Language, she says, is a means for regions to assert that they are different from the rest of Spain. She speculates on what could happen if the Spanish state gave these languages prestige nationally, beyond the areas where they are spoken, which is what Canada has done with French. Instead, Spain’s other co-official languages are invisible outside their regions and face an increasingly vocal, one-nation Spanish nationalism led by a resurgent neo-fascism not seen the end of the dictatorship in 1975. The far-right Vox party, vehemently opposed to minority languages, has produced a billboard campaign depicting the Asturian president kissing a language campaigner under the slogan: “They’re trying to stick their tongue in you.” On the other hand, Vilarrubias says, once a language becomes co-official, nationalist governments can try to marginalise Spanish and use language as a separatist tool. This is what is behind an ugly dispute in Canet de Mar, a seaside town north of Barcelona, where a family complained of harassment and abuse for seeking to have their five-year-old son taught at least partly in Spanish. Insisting on the right to be educated in Spanish as well as Catalan is viewed by nationalists as anti-Catalan, even though more than 50% of Catalans claim Spanish as their mother tongue, compared with 36% for Catalan. The resurgence of linguistic regionalism seems to undermine the process through which many of Europe’s nation-states emerged in the 19th century. Language standardisation was a used as a unifying factor, for example, in the creation of the Italian state in 1871. In recent decades, however, language has been used as a justification for separation, not unity. The European Union encourages the protection of minority languages – other than its 24 official languages (Irish only moved to official status on 1 January) – following the conviction that linguistic diversity is a social good. The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, adopted in 1992 by the human rights body the Council of Europe (which has 47 member states), recognises 60 minority languages spoken by 50 million Europeans, 10 million of whom are Catalan speakers. The charter does not provide any definition of what a language or dialect is. Scots, which many see as a dialect, is recognised by the UK in the charter, but Italy doesn’t recognise its numerous regional dialects as languages, although it does list 12 languages aside from Italian, among them Catalan, Albanian and Sardinian. “Dialects [in Italy] are not a political issue in the way the minority languages are in Spain,” says Anna Cozzolino, a Neapolitan resident in Barcelona whose dialect includes words of Spanish, Catalan, French and Arabic origin. “They survive because they’re spoken at home and in the street. Growing up in a middle-class Neapolitan family the local dialect was seen as vulgar but now people take pride in speaking it.” Asturian language campaigners want to keep the language alive by ensuring it is taught in schools. But the main motivation behind the drive to extend co-official status is to raise its profile and use in public life. Even in Catalonia, where a system of immersion ensures that everyone is fluent in Catalan, studies show that young people increasingly prefer to speak Spanish. This is partly because the internet and social media have further empowered Spanish and English, while doing nothing to stop the perception among many young people that Catalan is uncool. Immigration is also a factor. About 1.3 million of Catalonia’s 7.5 million inhabitants are immigrants with little or no stake in the nationalist discourse. Around a third are Spanish speakers from Latin America, but others, such as Moroccans, tend to also speak in Spanish, partly because Catalans don’t speak to them in Catalan, thus reinforcing the impression among many immigrants that Catalan isn’t for them. In the Basque country, where the educational options are 100% Spanish, 100% Euskera or a mix of the two, about 70% opt for Euskera, while immigrants are more likely to choose Spanish. About 750,000 of the Basque country’s 2.1 million inhabitants speak Euskera, an increase of 233,000 over 25 years which is an extraordinary achievement for a language that, unlike Galician and Catalan, is not part of the Latin family of languages. “There’s a lot of talk about language rights,” says Rafa Arenas, an Asturian who teaches law at the Universitat Autònoma in Barcelona. “The question is, does a language have a right to have people who speak it, or is about people’s linguistic rights?” González argues that, when a minority language is lost, we also lose a way of understanding the world. “This leads to uniformity which I don’t think is good for humanity. It’s our language and our culture and we still have time to save it. It’s my mother tongue.” Aníbal Martín, who is campaigning for Castúo, which is spoken in northern Extremadura, to be made co-official, agrees. “There’s a consensus that we need to conserve our material heritage – a Roman bridge, for example – and language is part of the heritage you carry within yourself,” he says. “Abandoning a language means abandoning part of who we are.” Back in Martimporra, Orfelina Suárez is perplexed by all the fuss. “I don’t understand why wanting to preserve a language could be so controversial,” she says. “Just because we stand up for Asturian, it doesn’t mean we’re politically motivated. It’s the politicians who politicise language.”",News/World news,The fight in Asturias for a fifth co-official Spanish language,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/04/asturias-fight-for-a-fifth-co-official-spanish-language
2/4/2022,"My earliest reading memoryAged five or so, at primary school: a story about two siblings, Janet and John, who didn’t have much of a life beyond throwing a red ball. Soon after, Roger Hargreaves’s Mr Greedy – much more fun, and terrifying when the giant shows up. The cover retained my bite marks.  My favourite book growing upThe Ghost of Thomas Kempe by Penelope Lively, about a boy chosen by an alchemist’s spirit to be an apprentice. It’s beautifully written, is set in English rural world of my boyhood, and I found reassurance in how the story was resolved not by force or cunning, but by acceptance, time and what we’d now call emotional intelligence. The book that changed me as a teenagerEB White’s Charlotte’s Web gave me the uncomfortable idea that the contents of my bacon sarnie had wanted to be alive as much as I did. Anne Frank’s Diary and Richard Wright’s Native Son gave me a sense of proportion regarding my own problems and injustices. The writer who changed my mindThe Reason I Jump by Naoki Higashida changed my mind about autism when I read it in my early 40s. Previously, I had interpreted my son’s non-verbal autism as a cognitive impairment. Thanks to this book, I understood it was me who had been labouring under a cognitive impairment. The books that made me want to be a writerSeveral, in no order: Ursula K Le Guin’s Earthsea trilogy; CS Lewis’s The Voyage of the Dawn Treader; Richard Adams’s Watership Down; Susan Cooper’s The Dark Is Rising quintet; the closing line of The Lord of the Rings – Sam’s “Well, I’m back.” I would lie in bed on Saturday morning asking the book: “How do you do that? How do you make readers feel what I’m feeling now?” The book I came back toJames Joyce’s Ulysses was my lockdown read. It was getting embarrassing having to go silent and vague when the subject of Joyce came up. I’m a professional novelist living in Ireland, for heaven’s sake. This time, it clicked. The book I rereadThe Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K Le Guin, once a decade. It’s trippy, human, mind-expanding, curious, feels more prescient by the year and has one of my favourite lines from anything: “The King was pregnant.” The book is a chance to catch up with my past and future selves and see how we’re getting on. The book I could never read againI devoured Willard Price’s Adventure series books as a kid, about two white American brothers, Hal and Roger Hunt, who scour the globe for endangered fauna to put in crates and send back to their father’s New York zoo. Our plucky heroes outwit rival animal hunters, Africans, Asians and “savages” too damn stubborn to recognise a white messiah when they see one. For some reason, you don’t see the books around any more … The books I discovered later in lifeHalldór Laxness’s Independent People. Marguerite Yourcenar’s Memoirs of Hadrian. Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations. Van Gogh’s letters to his brother Theo. Literature is an all-you-can-eat buffet with no expiry date. The book I am currently readingSudden Traveller, Sarah Hall’s latest short story collection. Ye Gods, Ms Hall is talented. My comfort readJamie Oliver’s 5 Ingredients cookbook, a Father’s Day present from my wife a couple of years ago.

2/4/2022,"A group of American truckers are seeking to import a Canadian movement to protest against vaccine mandates, with thousands of members on social media pledging to bring the demonstration to Washington DC next month. In Canada trucker protests have been linked to the far right and caused days of disruption in the capital, Ottawa, as well as in a border town in Alberta.  US organizers operating a Facebook group called Convoy to DC 2022 quickly gained more than 100,00 members and announced a convoy next month. But the Facebook group was recently removed by Meta. “We have removed this group for repeatedly violating our polices around QAnon,” said a spokesperson for Meta, referring to the QAnon conspiracy movement that has sprung up in rightwing circles and often promotes antisemitic tropes. Organizers of the convoy say they are demonstrating strictly against vaccine mandates, which they consider unconstitutional, and deny any affiliation to QAnon. “None of us are QAnon supporters or followers or anything like that,” said Jeremy Johnson, an organizer and one of the group admins. “We didn’t even have anything like that posted on our personal pages.” Johnson said his personal Facebook along with those of two of the other organizers were also removed for violating QAnon policies, despite his own disavowal of the conspiracy movement. He has appeared on the conservative channel Fox News since the ban, telling the Fox & Friends show: “They like to silence people that speak the truth.” Since being banned on Facebook the organizers of the convoy have moved to Telegram, where more than 28,000 have joined. The Guardian has reported on the rightwing exodus to alt-tech platforms like Telegram. In Canada, the protests have attracted far-right protesters, organizers and fundraisers. They have driven to Ottawa where some reportedly defaced statues and carried swastika flags. A separate trucker convoy has also blocked a border crossing into the US in the Alberta town of Coutts. Police in Ottawa recently warned they might have to call in the military to disband the protests. But some organizers in the US say far-right and far-left groups are not welcome in the group. “We don’t condone it or want it there. On either side,” said Brian Brase, one of the organizers. “All races, genders, sexual orientation, ethnicities, legal status are welcome,” said Brose. “This isn’t conservative or liberal.” Johnson said the convoy was about Covid-19 mandates, which they believe are unconstitutional, and not about the efficacy of vaccines or Covid-19 denial. “We’re not against the vaccine. We don’t want anybody to be discriminated against because they choose not to get the vaccine,” said Johnson. This month the supreme court’s conservative majority blocked a mandate from the Biden administration that would have required businesses with more than 100 employees to compel their staff to get vaccinated or provide a negative Covid test weekly. However, the court allowed a more limited vaccine mandate that affects about 10 million healthcare workers at facilities that participate in federal Medicaid and Medicare programs. But groups that monitor the far right in the US are concerned about the planned protest. “The far right uses big public events like this, particularly around Covid denial, as an opportunity to normalize their presence as well as an opportunity to recruit new members,” said Devin Burghart, executive director of Institute for Research & Education on Human Rights. “There are examples in Canada where the far right came out in droves.” Burghart said the far right seizes on vaccine hesitancy and Covid-19 denial, with legitimate healthcare awareness efforts outmatched by the sheer size of misinformation campaigns. “It’s very hard these days to draw a bright line in the Covid denial space that is dominated by conspiracy thinking and far-right ideology,” he said.",News/US news,US anti-vaccine mandate campaigners aim to mimic Canadian convoy tactic,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/04/us-anti-vaccine-mandate-convoy-canada
2/4/2022,"Boris Johnson has privately conceded there is less than a 30% chance of negotiating a new Brexit deal for Northern Ireland this month, it has emerged. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the leader of the Democratic Unionist party, said the prime minister made the admission during a private meeting last week.  Donaldson also said Johnson could not guarantee the UK would take unilateral action in the event the current Brexit negotiations with Brussels failed to result in a scrapping or radical reworking of the Northern Ireland protocol. Donaldson told BBC Radio Ulster’s Good Morning Ulster: “I met with the prime minister last week, I asked the prime minister two straight questions. I asked him what he thought were the prospects of agreement being reached with the EU on the protocol within the next few weeks. “His answer was ‘20 to 30% chance of agreement’. “I then asked the prime minister for a clear commitment that in the absence of an agreement with the EU, the UK government would do what they said in their command paper last July … and take unilateral action … the prime minister could not give me that commitment in those circumstances.” Donaldson also said on Friday he had warned the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who took over negotiations from David Frost in December, that the clock was ticking. He said he needed to see progress in talks by 31 January, further extending deadlines he had set in September and October. He also revealed Johnson had told him at the Tory party conference in October that there would be a new Brexit deal after “a short sharp negotiation” lasting just “three weeks”. Donaldson was speaking after a day of political drama triggered by two DUP decisions. On Wednesday its agriculture minister, Edwin Poots, ordered a halt to Brexit checks on food and farm products at all Northern Ireland ports and airports setting it on a collision course with Westminster and Brussels. And on Thursday the DUP carried out its threat to quit the executive in Stormont, announcing that the first minister, Paul Givan, was resigning. Rival parties have rounded on the DUP’s decision to quit Stormont in a row over the protocol, paralysing decision-making until after the local elections in May. One of the critical decisions now on hold is the approval of a three-year budget that would have enabled critical changes in the health service, which has one of the worst waiting lists in Europe. Donaldson said he had no choice but to act as the current protocol presented an “existential threat” to the union of the UK. He said rivals had already goaded him as the “boy who cried wolf” but he had shown patience and given the government and the EU time to deliver a new Brexit deal. He said it was “premature” to set a three-year budget before the May elections when a “fresh mandate” could be set. The DUP’s decision to instruct port officials to stop conducting Brexit checks on food and farm products arriving from Great Britain is already being challenged in the courts. Two unnamed individuals lodged an emergency application for a judicial review of Poots’s order on Thursday with a hearing expected on Friday. During the initial hearing it emerged that the checks would not be stopped until Monday at the earliest.",News/UK news,Brexit: ‘30% chance’ of new deal for Northern Ireland – Johnson,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/04/boris-johnson-30-percent-chance-new-brexit-deal-northern-ireland
2/4/2022,"An elite Australian soldier has told a court he heard Ben Roberts-Smith order the shooting of an unarmed Afghan man he was interrogating during a mission in Afghanistan in 2012. Much of the testimony presented in the decorated war veteran’s defamation trial this week had centred on two alleged shootings committed during a raid on a compound in the village of Kakarak in April 2009.  But late on Friday, the federal court heard a former comrade of Roberts-Smith give evidence about another alleged shooting, in 2012. The elite soldier told the court Roberts-Smith commanded a military interpreter to order an Afghan national army soldier kill an unarmed captive. Roberts-Smith is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing. On Friday, the court heard evidence from a still-serving SAS soldier, anonymised in evidence as Person 14, who served eight tours of Afghanistan in the SAS as well as three in Iraq and three in East Timor. He told the court he was assigned to Roberts-Smith’s patrol on 12 October 2012, during a mission in Khas Uruzgan. The Australian soldiers conducted the mission alongside members of the Afghan national army. As the mission was being concluded, and the helicopters to extract the Australian soldiers were en route from their Tarin Kowt base, Roberts-Smith was interrogating an Afghan male detained inside a compound, according to evidence from Person 14. The male, who was not armed, was referred to as a “PUC”, an acronym for person under control. Evidence before the court said the man “was not exhibiting any signs of being a threat or violent”. As Roberts-Smith conducted the interrogation, Person 14 said he was standing to the side of the compound when he noticed a discolouration on one of the mud walls: “It had been recently plastered with mud.” “I thought, ‘oh, there’s a cache’.” Person 14 kicked the discoloured area and a cache of weapons fell out, including rifles, ammunition, binoculars, and rocket-propelled grenades. As Person 14 walked back towards the interrogation, Roberts-Smith turned towards the Australian forces’ interpreter. Person 14 was standing behind the interpreter. Roberts-Smith pointed at the senior member of the Afghan national army who was on the raid with the Australians and then gestured towards the PUC. Roberts-Smith said: “Tell him to shoot him or I will,” Person 14 told the court. The interpreter initially refused to interpret the message, so Roberts-Smith repeated it: “Tell him to shoot him or I will.” The interpreter passed on the message to the Afghan soldiers, and after some discussion between the interpreter and the Afghan soldiers, a member of the Afghan forces stepped forward towards the PUC. “One of his soldiers … stepped out of the group of soldiers, trained his suppressed M4 [rifle] on the Afghan man and unloaded five to eight rounds into his centre of … mass … his torso,” Person 14 told the court. Person 14 said as the unarmed Afghan fell, the soldier fired two more bullets into the man’s neck and head. “I was perplexed but didn’t say anything. We were close to extraction,” Person 14 told the court. In earlier evidence this week, another still-serving member of the SAS, anonymised as Person 41, told the court he had seen Roberts-Smith order a subordinate soldier to execute a captive, unarmed elderly man during a 2009 raid on the Whiskey 108 compound. Person 41 said he also saw Roberts-Smith “frog-march” a man with a prosthetic leg outside the same compound before throwing him to the ground and machine-gunning him to death. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Person 14 gave evidence that he saw an Australian soldier shoot the man with the prosthetic leg with a machine gun in a similar fashion. He said he did not recognise Roberts-Smith at the time, in fading light, but later saw Roberts-Smith holding the uncommon weapon, a Minimi machine gun, used to kill the man, and recognised his distinctive camouflage face paint from the scene. Under cross-examination, Person 14 said he had doubts about the awarding of the Victoria Cross to Roberts-Smith, but added he had a “good” working relationship with the decorated veteran.

2/4/2022,"Nord Stream 2, the controversial Russian gas pipeline to Germany, will be part of the package of sanctions facing the Kremlin if Ukraine is invaded, Ursula von der Leyen has said. In comments that appear to go further than any commitments made by Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, the European Commission president sought to clear up any doubt about the pipeline’s future.  “Nord Stream 2 cannot be excluded from the sanctions list, that is very clear”, Von der Leyen said in an interview with the Handelsblatt and Les Echos newspapers. The commission president said the future of the pipeline, which is yet to receive regulatory approval in Berlin or Brussels, would depend “on Russia’s behaviour”. The latest estimate is that Russia has mobilised 145,000 troops on its border with Ukraine, with the US claiming on Thursday it had uncovered plans for a Russian “propaganda video” it believed could have been used to justify an invasion. The video, the US said, would depict a staged false explosion with dead bodies and actors as mourners following an “attack” by Ukraine or its Nato allies. Von der Leyen’s commitment offers clarity on an issue on which Scholz has remained vague, stating only that “all options are on the table”. The chancellor has come under heavy criticism domestically for the stance. In recent days Ukraine’s government had called for greater transparency on the potential range of EU sanctions facing the Kremlin. “Make it available for the Russians, for everyone, so that the Russians can see what awaits for them,” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said. Von der Leyen responded to that call by shedding light on the package, saying it “ranges from closing access to foreign capital to export controls on critical goods, hi-tech components that Russia cannot simply replace, for example in the field of artificial intelligence and weaponry, quantum computers, lasers and space.” She described the sanctions list as “robust and comprehensive”, adding: “People close to [Russian president Vladimir] Putin and oligarchs could of course be hit sensitively.”",News/World news,Von der Leyen warns Russia of gas pipeline sanctions over Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/04/von-der-leyen-warns-russia-of-gas-pipeline-sanctions-over-ukraine-nord-stream-2
