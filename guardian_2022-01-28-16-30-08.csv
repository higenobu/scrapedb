1/28/2022,"The Australian writer Hannah Kent has found critical and commercial success with fictionalised reworkings of real-life historical crimes. Her bestselling debut, Burial Rites, shortlisted for the 2014 Women’s prize, examined the case of Agnes Magnúsdóttir, condemned to death in Iceland in 1829 for the savage murder of her master. Her second, The Good People, was based on 1820s newspaper reports about the violent attempts by an Irish village to banish a child they believed to be a changeling. Both books cleaved closely to the historical record, working within the constraints of the known facts to invest those bleak and brutal stories with ambiguity and depth, and to give a voice to participants whom the past had long condemned to silence.  With Devotion, Kent returns for a third time to the same period, this time to the Prussian village of Kay and a close-knit community of Old Lutherans, compelled by the strict religious reforms of their emperor to worship in secret. Many of Kent’s familiar themes are here: the fierce connections and exclusions that bind small communities; the tension between doctrinal religion and superstition; the power of landscape. This time, however, the history is much closer to home. Kent grew up (and still lives) in the Adelaide Hills in South Australia. Most of the émigrés who settled in this unceded Indigenous land were English, but some were Prussians like the Old Lutherans of Kay, in search of a place where they could practise their faith in peace. Those Prussians were Kent’s forebears – the start of her own story. This novel is different in other ways, too. Kent originally conceived her third book as an exploration of the power of female friendship but, in 2017, as Australia voted in favour of same-sex marriage and her girlfriend proposed, she realised that she wanted to go further, to celebrate the love between two women with “music instead of silence, presence instead of absence”. Devotion is, from its opening pages, a passionate celebration of that love. Fifteen-year-old Hanne has never fitted in with the other girls in the village: they “came together in a dance she did not know the steps to”. A wild soul with a connection to nature so deep that she hears the songs of the trees and the bell-chime of snow falling, Hanne has come to believe that she is “a cuckoo born to a songbird”, someone who cannot properly be loved even by her own mother. Then she meets Thea. Kent describes Devotion as “a return to the light after two books that have very much considered the dark”, but, from the outset, there are shadows. Before Hanne and Thea even meet, long before they embark with the rest of the village on the gruelling journey to Australia, their story is an elegy, freighted with loss and longing, the smallest of shared moments heavy with significance. At their best these moments are piercingly beautiful. When Hanne confesses that “Thea was as a chink of light in a curtain. When I put my eye to her, the world beyond blazed”, her words cut cleanly to the heart. There is poetry, too, in Hanne’s profound engagement with the natural world. She writes of “greasy-fingered light” on the mudflats, the wind wanting “to drag her into a dance”. Like Hanne’s love for God, her love for Thea is bound up in landscape, a part of both its glorious vastness and its tiny, perfect details. It is a pity, then, that too often Kent allows the twin raptures of faith and physical love to get the better of her prose, whipping it into ecstasies that come dangerously close to pastiche. “With the firm grip of [Thea’s] fingers between my own,” Hanne gasps as they set sail for Australia, “I felt time dissolve in the arms of the ocean’s brilliant, salted constancy.” The larger difficulty with Devotion, however, is that, despite the vast distances travelled by the people of Kay, the narrative never quite takes flight. Kent keeps some surprises up her sleeve, upending our expectations of where this story will go, but her large cast of villagers remain fixed in their roles. Their odyssey is gruelling – Kent has done her research and does not spare the detail – but no one really changes. Those who started out good stay good and in the same ways. The bad continue to be bad. Hanne is transported by her love for Thea and their relationship opens her up to become fully herself, but that self is essentially unaltered. Hanne’s passion is absolute, unwavering, untainted by the doubt or fear essential for self-revelation. The reader is left craving more of the darkness of Kent’s previous work, darkness that might have defined Hanne more clearly and ensured that this sweet misfit seized our hearts and imaginations as Agnes, the violent murderer in Burial Rites, so powerfully contrived to do.

1/28/2022,"Across the twenty seasons that Rafael Nadal has spent travelling the world as a professional tennis player, he has slowly and with great difficulty compiled one of the greatest sporting CVs the world has seen. He has won so much both at his very best and when his body has been on the brink of crumbling, but what he has achieved so far this year already stands high on his unending list of achievements.  After a six month layoff due to a chronic foot injury, a recent bout of Covid and swirling doubts about whether he would ever return to competition, at 35 Nadal has risen to produce one of his more improbable runs to a grand slam final at the Australian Open. He has not only done so by relying on his unrelenting fight, but by adapting and playing efficiently, attacking tennis at a time when his body most needs it. On Friday afternoon under the Rod Laver Arena roof, he outplayed Matteo Berrettini for two sets and then held off a late fightback to win 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 and reach his sixth Australian Open final. “I started the match playing great. The first two sets were one of the best so far since a long time. Then I know how good Matteo is, he is a very solid player, very dangerous. In the third I know at some point he is going to go for the shots,” said Nadal. He noted that he’d have to suffer but he won. Nadal’s victory has afforded him many more distinctions that will give him great satisfaction. After being told for so many years that his playing style would not be conducive to longevity in his career, he continues to succeed in his advancing age. He is now the fourth oldest man in the Open Era to reach the Australian Open final and only four other men aged 35 and over have reached any major final. Most importantly though, on Sunday he will compete for his 21st grand slam title and the chance to break his tie of 20 with Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer and become the sole owner of the men’s all-time grand slam record. Asked on-court about the possibility of winning his 21st title, Nadal said the focus was only on this tournament and he resolved to simply enjoy the achievement. “For me it’s all about the Australian Open more than anything else. It just an amazing event that as I said a couple of days ago now, I have been a little bit unlucky in my career with some injuries,” he said. As rain forced the Rod Laver roof into action shortly before play was due to begin, the match-up issues for Berrettini were always clear. Berrettini has done an incredible job of improving each year, but while he can unleash hell with his serve and forehand, his backhand is by far the worst shot on the court in most matches against the best. Unfortunately for Berrettini, he just so happened to be standing before a player who has spent his career tearing the weak backhands of right-handed players apart. Nadal started the match finding ample forehands and he used them to relentlessly pepper the Berrettini backhand, dragging him off the court with every new crosscourt forehand. When Nadal was not exposing the Italian’s backhand, he pressured the Italian’s poor return of serve. Throughout the first two sets, Nadal served extremely well and breezed through his service games, constantly looking to attack and control rallies with his forehand. For all of his backhand deficiencies, Berrettini plays with unbridled passion and desire. Instead of slumping, he fought for his life, first stringing together early service games and then using his growing confidence to unleash an incredible return game at 4-3. After producing one of the shots of the tournament, an around-the-post forehand winner, on break point Berrettini survived Nadal’s backhand onslaught, found a forehand and demolished it down-the line to break. After the Italian served out the third set, the match had changed. Berrettini was breezing through his service games, utterly demolishing the ball, and it looked like a different match. Berrettini had his chance at 3-3, 15-30 but he netted a forehand and Nadal held serve. Suddenly, he was under pressure again in a long deuce game filled with tension, long points and soundtracked by a roaring crowd. It ended with two consecutive forehand errors by Berrettini to give up the decisive break and Nadal served out a brilliant win. This run has been defined by Nadal’s adaptability. With his chronic foot injury, he knows that he cannot grind for hours behind the baseline and so he has resolved to be as efficient as he has ever been. Even against Berrettitni, the biggest server he has faced this year in Melbourne, instead of his preferred deep return position, he took up an advanced position, split-stepping forward into the ball to meet those enormous serves early. Before the tournament, even when it was not clear that Novak Djokovic would attempt to travel to Melbourne, there was no buzz about Nadal winning his 21st grand slam title here. Nadal himself played his own chances down as he simply tried to see how his body and his game would react in such unideal circumstances. It seemed like a sensible outlook. But over his career Nadal has defied logic, and as he returned to compete for another Australian Open title, he has done so once more.

1/28/2022,"When Australia resumed batting at 327 for seven on the second morning of the Canberra Test match, Plan A was to push on towards 400. With Jess Jonassen and Annabel Sutherland batting in positions far below their ability, this was realistic. But as England swung the ball and took wickets under heavy cloud, things changed with a hasty declaration. Plan B was to make the most of those same bowling conditions. With England 38 for two at lunch and 120 for six at tea, only Heather Knight’s outstanding innings of 127 not out stopped it working like a charm. Australia only added 10 runs in 7.1 overs to the overnight score, declaring at 337 for nine rather than sending 18-year-old fast bowler Darcie Brown out to join debutant leg-spinner Alana King with the bat. Sutherland was bowled for eight by a Katherine Brunt special that swung past a defensive shot to hit the top of off stump, before Jonassen edged behind on two. That gave Brunt figures of five for 60 and Amy Jones a sixth catch, equalling the record in a women’s Test innings set by England keeper Lisa Nye in 1992.  As much as Australia’s bowlers produced a concerted performance, sloppy batting from England played its part. Lauren Winfield-Hill scored one boundary through the cordon before throwing a bottom-handed slice at width from Brown, edging to Beth Mooney at second slip. Tammy Beaumont’s high backlift, honed for attack in white-ball formats, left her looking vulnerable in defence, and so it proved as Ellyse Perry decked a ball in to hit her on the back thigh before the bat could intercede. With Beaumont gone for five, a score of 23 for two was still better than Australia’s first innings start of four for two. But where the Australians had combined restraint with counterattack from that point to keep the score moving, England ground to a halt. Perry bowled seven overs straight off the top of the innings, giving little away, but fellow seamers Brown, Sutherland, and Tahlia McGrath all offered short wide balls on occasion that were rarely put away. Natalie Sciver made 15 from 42 before one of Sutherland’s mediums jagged back off the seam, taking the inside edge to the wicketkeeper as Sciver tried to protect her stumps. Sophia Dunkley started slowly before hitting three boundaries but was also out for 15, hanging out her bat to Perry and chopping onto her stumps from the last ball before drinks in the middle session. Amy Jones made a slow 13, eventually trying to pull a Sutherland delivery that wasn’t short enough, top-edging wide of mid on where Brown made up ground to take an excellent diving catch. In the meantime, England’s captain was left to do the job on her own. After a couple of early sliced drives, Knight looked impeccable. She worked singles from the pace of Brown, drove stylishly to the on side when King overpitched, and played the pull shot and cover drive well against seam. By the time the fifth wicket fell, Knight had 56 runs of England’s 118. The follow-on mark of 188 now looked distant, and more so when Brunt, batting too high at No 7, was lbw playing back to the leg-spinner. That meant that King, Sutherland and Brown had each taken their first Test wicket in the innings. But Knight was not giving up, even as Charlie Dean and Anya Shrubsole popped up cheap catches from spin. The captain was on 92 when Sophie Ecclestone joined her at 169 for eight, and the left-arm spinner kept her company until Knight was viciously swishing her bat through the air in celebration of her second Test century. With that done, the pair sailed past the follow-on, then past 200, in an unbroken partnership of 66. It made for an extraordinary scorecard: when Ecclestone drove a boundary down the ground with 10 minutes to go in the day, Knight was on 121 and Ecclestone had become the first of her teammates in the innings to go past 15. There will be much more work for the pair to do on the third day, with Ecclestone on 27, and England 102 runs behind at 235 for eight. But given how the day had gone until that stand, things could have been much worse. There are still two days to see who can plot a road to victory from here.",Sport/Sport,Heather Knight hits century to rescue England on day two of Women’s Ashes Test,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/28/heather-knight-hits-century-to-rescue-england-on-day-two-of-womens-ashes-test
1/28/2022,"Hungarian journalists targeted with Pegasus spyware plan to take legal action against the Hungarian state and the Israeli company NSO, which manufactures the tool. The Pegasus Project, a consortium of news outlets including the Guardian, revealed last summer that forensic analysis of mobile devices showed that a number of journalists in the country had been targeted with Pegasus.  The invasive spyware allows its operator to take control of a target’s mobile device, access all data, even from encrypted messaging apps, and turn on audio or video recording. It is only meant for use against terrorists and serious criminals, but the Pegasus Project revealed that Hungary appeared to be one of many countries where the tool was being abused. At the time, the Hungarian government deflected questions about whether it had used Pegasus to spy on the named individuals, and refused to confirm whether it had acquired the spyware. However, in November a senior government official acknowledged for the first time that Hungary had indeed acquired Pegasus. Now the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union (HCLU) has announced it will launch legal action on behalf of six clients: Brigitta Csikász, Dávid Dercsényi, Dániel Németh and Szabolcs Panyi, all journalists; Adrien Beauduin, a Belgian-Canadian PhD student and activist; and a sixth person who requested anonymity. “It is unacceptable that the operations of the national security services, which are necessarily carried out in secret, should become a tool of oppression rather than a means of protecting citizens,” said Ádám Remport, of the HCLU. The HCLU will pursue various legal avenues, including complaints to the ministers overseeing the secret services in Hungary, requests to the security services to divulge information, and legal action in the courts. “What we would like is for our clients to have direct evidence of their being surveilled and the disclosure of the data gathered on them,” said Remport. “If we can get good rulings it would mean that a new avenue for redress would open for anyone who has been secretly surveilled.” Remport admitted that previous case law suggested that the courts usually sided with the security services, and that the cases were likely to take months if not years to proceed through the courts. However, the Hungarian legal action could become a template for victims of unlawful surveillance in other countries. The HCLU and Eitay Mack, an Israeli lawyer, will also file a demand to the Israeli attorney general asking for a criminal case to be opened against NSO in Israel and the Israeli officials who approved the sale to Viktor Orbán’s government. “They should have known from the beginning the deteriorating situation in Hungary, and that targeting the press is a main activity of the Orbán regime,” said Mack, who said he wanted them charged with violating Israeli wiretapping and privacy laws, among others. He pointed to a 2016 ruling of the European court of human rights that criticised the use of surveillance in Hungary. NSO Group did not respond to a request for comment, but in previous answers to the Guardian it said it could not confirm or deny whether particular countries were clients. It also insisted its tools were only meant for use against criminals and terrorists and should not be used on dissidents, activists or journalists. “The international community should have zero-tolerance policy towards such acts, therefore a global regulation is needed. NSO has proven in the past it has zero tolerance for these types of misuse by terminating multiple contracts,” the company said. Panyi, an investigative journalist with the Hungarian outlet Direkt36, which was a partner on the Pegasus Project, was targeted with Pegasus on numerous occasions, according to forensic analysis of his phone. He said the case was a symbolic one that was more about trying to force reform of the system of authorising surveillance in Hungary than getting any personal justice. “Infringing my right to protect my sources is the most troubling thing for me,” Panyi said. “It’s very hard to understand the true aim, whether they were after my sources, if they wanted to get a heads up on what I’m working on, or try to gather dirt on me.” He said he hoped that as a result of the case he might find out more about why he was targeted. “I would at least like to receive some information about which agency was surveilling me, when and why,” he said.",News/World news,Hungarian journalists targeted with Pegasus spyware to sue state,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/28/hungarian-journalists-targeted-with-pegasus-spyware-to-sue-state

1/28/2022,"Britain’s children are being failed by schools when it comes to learning about the climate crisis, with the subject often wholly missing from the curriculum, sidelined, or mistaught, students and education experts have said. A private member’s bill that would require basic knowledge of climate issues to be taught in the national curriculum receives its second reading in parliament on Friday with cross-party support. But it is unlikely to make it to the statute books, despite promises at Cop26 last November that ministers would prioritise climate education in schools.  Nadia Whittome, the Labour MP who brought forward the bill, said: “The education system should be helping young people to get informed on the impacts of climate change – it’s their lives that will be affected. It’s also part of how we will reach net zero – give young people the tools to be part of the solution.” Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, pledged at Cop26 to “put climate change at the heart of education”. A draft strategy is due to be published in April. The Guardian has reported that an early version told teachers not to advise pupils to get involved in climate protests. However, students and experts said the UK was failing to equip young people with the skills they will need to understand and cope with the climate emergency. A survey of 4,680 teachers in England found that two-thirds of secondary school teachers felt climate change was not taught in a meaningful way within their subject, even though nine out of 10 said the climate was relevant to their subject area. Four in 10 teachers said they would like more time and capacity to devote to climate issues, as well as more cross-subject collaboration. Students have described their frustration at the lack of opportunities and resources to discuss the climate crisis in class. Scarlett Westbrook, 17, from Birmingham, who helped to write the climate education bill, faced a question on her geography GCSE paper in 2020 requiring her to list benefits from climate change. She complied, to get the marks, but also wrote that any benefits were vastly outweighed by the damage – a note that was criticised by the exam marker. “I was shocked to be asked that. To have to write that to get marks was a really weird dilemma – should I spite the education system or spike my exams?” she said. “I think there has been influence from lobby groups, and that’s why the education on this subject is so bad.” Phoebe Hanson, a second-year politics student at Lancaster University, said young people had a right to expect the education system to inform them about and equip them to understand the crisis. “We are growing up in this world where the climate is changing. The immensity of that is terrifying. But in our education system, this subject is just tacked on the side. We are letting people down,” she said. Matt Carmichael, an English teacher in Leeds, said teachers felt under pressure to be cautious about discussing the climate crisis. “I educated myself on the issue, but I know colleagues who lack the confidence and know this as a controversial subject that they don’t feel equipped to teach,” he said. “It’s vital that we do teach it as there is lots of misinformation out there, especially on social media, and lots of anxiety among young people.” Education is a devolved issue, and the survey, by the Teach the Future campaign, applied only to England. However, Teach the Future covers all four UK nations, and it said schoolchildren were poorly served on climate education across the UK. A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “Topics related to climate change already feature across the curriculum at primary and secondary school. By 2023, all teachers in all phases and subjects will have access to high-quality curriculum resources, so they can confidently choose those that will support the teaching of sustainability and climate change. “Our new sustainability and climate change strategy will help empower all teachers to deliver education on climate change. From aiding the development of climate interests in early childhood right through to the skills needed for green careers. It also goes beyond the classroom – children and young people will get hands-on experience of understanding, nurturing and protecting the biodiversity around them through our new national education nature park and climate leaders awards.”",News/Education,"UK pupils failed by schools’ teaching of climate crisis, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/28/uk-pupils-failed-by-schools-teaching-of-climate-crisis-experts-say
1/28/2022,"Road pricing may promise a fairer, sustainable way to make polluting drivers pay, ease congestion and fund better transport, but few politicians in power have ever wanted to take the flak that would come with introducing it. The Treasury has stressed the move from petrol and diesel to electric cars as part of Britain’s net zero strategy will require new sources of revenue to replace billions in lost fuel and vehicle excise duty. However, despite a year of speculation that the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was warming to the idea, there has been no mention of road pricing as a possible solution in his budgets.  Sadiq Khan has been bolder, announcing last week that London will bring in more charges for motorists, in some form, by 2024. While Khan has backed road pricing in principle, last week’s announcement still contained the familiar caveat that the technology to make a London-wide scheme work wouldn’t be ready until some time later in the decade. The city is potentially the canary in the coalmine for the rest of the UK. Congestion has grown, and London needs to tackle widespread air pollution and meet challenging environmental targets, with an ambition to drive down car use by more than a quarter. But there is also an imminent funding crisis after Covid, with billions in lost revenue from transport and the government unwilling to fully help the mayor. Why is road pricing likely to happen, how might it work and what are the potential obstacles? Roads, unlike most utilities, are essentially unmetered, with the way they are paid for failing to reflect when and where they are used. Instead the Treasury collects money from motorists via fuel duty and vehicle excise duty. Fuel duty is a blunt tool that charges motorists for how much they drive, and the efficiency of their vehicle. Raising it has become politically toxic – Conservative chancellors have frozen the 57.9p-a-litre levy for a decade – but the bigger longer-term problem is the move to electric cars. That puts fuel duty revenues, about £28bn a year pre-pandemic, on their own path to net zero. Vehicle excise duty, worth roughly £6bn a year, is also currently not paid by electric car owners, who are likewise exempt from London’s congestion or clean air charges. That is seen as an acceptable trade-off for the high purchase price of electric cars for early adopters, but car owners driving “for free” could soon feel politically tricky, and in the long term new funding, such as road pricing, feels inevitable. Worldwide, basic road-charging schemes currently range from tolls for bridges, tunnels, or stretches of motorway, to the kind of congestion zone London already has, often relying on number plate recognition cameras, transponders or other sensors. Singapore has arguably come closest to a comprehensive road-pricing scheme, with motorists billed automatically for journeys calculated via in-car units triggered when they pass a series of gantries. The system was first put in place before the millennium. But the grid road system in the small city state makes it relatively easy to calculate where someone has driven from a series of fixed points. London’s eventual scheme – particularly if it does, as the mayor suggested, take account of factors such as the relative availability of public transport, congestion, or time of day as well as distance travelled – would require some form of GPS tracking. Khan said the tech could be ready in two and half years, just beyond his remaining term in office. The Green party and others argue it has been ready for years, in various forms. For example, car owners have grown used to insurers installing black boxes that can track speed and performance. A smart road-pricing scheme could require in an in-car device, as used in Singapore – but that could be replaced by a smartphone and app. As any user of satnav or exercise apps knows, an individual’s movements can already be tracked effectively. However, Steve Gooding, the director of the RAC Foundation, is less convinced: “Is [the technology] ready at the scale it needs to be, for everything it needs to do, for all the vehicles moving in Greater London 365 days a year?” London’s congestion zone was originally set up in 2003 by the then mayor, Ken Livingstone, with clear separation from the other arms of the state. But in 2015 his successor, Boris Johnson, instructed Transport for London to give full access to the data to the Metropolitan police, and records of who drives into central London are now stored for two years. The Green party’s Siân Berry, a London Assembly member who has long backed the idea of road pricing, says stricter safeguards should be in place around the data – and more would certainly be needed should journeys be logged by GPS. That could be via an app that is under the driver’s own control in terms of details, or an in-car unit that tots up charges but does not keep a journey history, she suggests. “But you need to put privacy into the conversation early on, not later, or you risk it becoming an issue that cancels the scheme.” As a report in 2021 from Tony Blair’s Institute for Global Change noted, this cuts both ways: do nothing to reform the system and the wealthiest electric car owners will forever get a free ride while still using roads and creating congestion – and particulate pollution. While it is argued that overall, road pricing should be fairer and beneficial, there may be winners and losers, particularly at the borders of schemes, and key workers with fixed shift times may not be able to avoid peak charges. But the status quo is not fair for non car-owners, argues Berry. She adds: “It’s 20p for petrol or £1.50 for the bus for a short journey – the price signals are completely wrong.” The London congestion charge proved less of a vote-loser for Livingstone than many anticipated. However, attempts by Labour in 2007 to implement a nationwide road-pricing scheme attracted what was then one of the biggest protest petitions from the public. The tide may be turning, slowly. Concerns over car use and urban air quality are firmly on the agenda. Motoring organisations have also joined the call for charging in some form: the RAC Foundation backs it, while the AA’s Edmund King has proposed tradeable “road miles”, measured through telematics. A recent report from the Social Market Foundation thinktank claimed that the formerly hostile UK public could now be won over.",News/Business,Will road pricing answer the UK’s net-zero car-tax conundrum?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/28/will-road-pricing-answer-the-uks-net-zero-car-tax-conundrum
1/28/2022,"New Yorkers love a big trial. From Joan Collins, who resisted a claim from her publisher over an “unpublishable” manuscript, to Leona Helmsley’s “only little people pay taxes” prosecution, to a long line of swindlers, cheats, celebrity divorces and mafia take-downs, each scandal-strewn case becomes part of the metropolis’s dirty jungle lore.  Short of an intervening settlement, it appears that the Duke of York is to join a long list of high-profile defendants. And, with the prospect of a senior British royal on trial, it is a case that would go down in city history. Prince Andrew’s civil case does not carry the risk of jail time. But in a city obsessed with money, power and prestige, a famous prince in the dock, facing further losses of each after being forced to withdraw from royal duties, could be a late summer feast of contentious jurisprudence for a city desperate for pandemic distraction. The prospect of a jury trial follows the prince’s attorney’s decision on Wednesday to file legal papers strongly resisting sexual abuse claims brought against him by his accuser, Virginia Giuffre. In the papers, Andrew’s legal team denied the allegations and then sought to blame Giuffre for being partly responsible for her abuse. That move has been criticized as “cruel” and “inappropriate” by legal experts. Giuffre claims she had sex with the prince when she was 17 and a minor under US law. She says they were introduced by the disgraced late US financier Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself in prison while awaiting trial for sex crimes, and the convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. The response to Giuffre’s complaint denied all allegations and questioned her lawsuit’s validity on jurisdictional grounds. It also demanded a jury trial – notwithstanding that, as the defendant, it’s not Andrew’s to demand. To many experts, it seemed largely unremarkable save for two of the eleven entries marked Affirmative Defense. In one, titled Damages Contributed to by Others, his attorneys wrote: “Assuming, without admitting, that Giuffre has suffered any injury or damage, Giuffre and/or others, who are not Prince Andrew, contributed in whole or in part to the alleged damage.” In the other, titled Consent, they wrote: “Assuming, without admitting, that Giuffre has suffered any injury or damage alleged in the Complaint, Giuffre’s claims are barred by the doctrine of consent.” Sexual abuse attorneys and former sex crimes prosecutorssay both statements are astonishingly tone-deaf, both in public relations terms and if those defense claims come before a New York jury. The prince is effectively making the argument that Giuffre, a victim of the Epstein-Maxwell conspiracy to traffic minors, consented to having sex while being trafficked, and while being under the age of majority. The first statement – Damages Contributed to by Others – is the response of a “cruel person and an outrage because Andrew did not have to assert that as a claim”, said the former sex crimes prosecutor Wendy Murphy, a professor of sexual violence law at New England Law | Boston. “To say that she was acting of her own volitions and causing herself to be raped by a man with so much more power is … a dangerous thing to do. It’s going to cause enormous negative publicity for the prince, as it should, and if you ask a jury to blame a kid, they’re going to come back at you with a vengeance,” Murphy added. Victims’ lawyers agreed that the prince was attempting to blame the victim. “Prince Andrew denied ever meeting Ms Giuffre and denied that they ever had sexual contact. Now in his answer to the court, he is still denying it, but unbelievably says if the acts occurred, they were consensual,” said Eric Baum of Eisenberg & Baum. The question of how a 17-year-old could consent to systematic sex trafficking is baffling to Murphy, who points out that under sex trafficking laws, consent is illegal as a matter of public policy. “A human being cannot consent to trafficking any more than they can consent to slavery,” she said. Murphy argued that the Duke’s affirmative “Consent” defense – while technically legal under an assault and battery statutes -- is “inappropriate … when you know, and the allegations are, this was a systematic trafficking industry, an illegal enterprise that was extraordinarily well-established and just grotesque in terms of how they were soliciting and choosing vulnerable girls.” In a statement to NBC News on Wednesday, Giuffre’s attorney, David Boies, responded to the filing: “Prince Andrew continues his playbook denying any knowledge or information about the claims despite photographic evidence and third party testimony to the contrary. He also continues his pattern trying to blame the victim for her abuse.” Legal experts have also voiced opinions that the prince’s legal strategy does not preclude a settlement with a statement of responsibility, as Boies has hinted would be a part of his client’s terms. But Giuffre’s legal team still have to prove that the alleged touching was offensive and non-consensual. “She has to prove that it was non-consensual touching, and Andrew could win by saying it was consensual – and he can do that at trial,” says Murphy. “What he does not have to do is assert it as an affirmative defense. Politically, it’s a tin-eared thing for a lawyer to do in a case like this, where the public is well aware that this is about trafficking, not an 18-year-old boy having sex with his 15-year-old girlfriend.” All in all, if a trial does go ahead in New York, it appears all but certain to join the storied list of the city’s most shocking scandals: an elite list of bold-faced names that no one wants to be on.

1/28/2022,"Start The Ram Inn, Firle, East SussexDistance 5 milesTime 2½ hoursTotal ascent 200 metresDifficulty Moderate  This article includes content provided by Google. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'. No artist has captured the curves and chalky pastel colours of the Sussex landscape like Eric Ravilious (1903-1942). In his book The Old Ways, Robert MacFarlane writes glowingly of Ravilious’s “dreamy watercolours” and calls him “an artist of the path”. Ravilious grew up in East Sussex but spent much of his adult life away from the area, returning throughout the 1930s to paint the landscape of his childhood. From his timeless depictions of the Long Man of Wilmington to his paintings of Cuckmere Haven and the serpentine Ouse, the brooding skies, furrowed land and undulations of the Downs are ever-present in his work. This circular walk from the glorious Ram Inn at Firle journeys through countryside that has changed little since Ravilious first painted it over 70 years ago. It climbs high on to the Downs and offers spectacular views of East Sussex and the coast – should you choose to do it during the day. But for a more unusual experience, this walk, with its clearly marked pathways, can also be enjoyed by night. Leave at twilight in the daylight-saving months and you can enjoy a nocturnal ramble and still be back at the Ram in time for dinner. Or you might prefer to eat first, then take a moonlit hike to walk off a hearty roast and a pint of Harvey’s. Needless to say, this is best done when the moon is plump and bright. From the front of the Ram Inn, head south towards the Downs through the village, passing the old store, village hall and Little Talland House, which Virginia Woolf rented for a year from January 1911. She described the house as “an ‘inconceivably ugly and hideous suburban villa”, but was charmed by the village itself. Firle remains a handsome sleepy hamlet, a time capsule of brick and flint houses, many covered with ivy. It is the imagined village of every classic children’s adventure story. The route towards the Downs passes Firle’s 12th-century church and the Burning Sky brewery. When the road bends to the right, carry straight on, keeping a long flint farm building on your left. The path soon curves to the left with a long high wall and the Downs to your right. Whether lit by moon or sun, the combination of rolling farmland and hills can be enchanting. Stay on this path until reaching a fingerpost and a triangle of paths with a tree in the middle. Go through the gate on your right and you’ll soon be ascending a steepish path to the top of the Downs. The chalk path may glow in moonlight but can be slippy and sticky if wet, so watch your footing and use a torch if necessary. A post halfway up is perfect for taking in the view and enjoying a breather. Look for the round turret-like folly on the Firle Estate to your left and the ripple effects – terracettes – on the closest slope, caused by centuries of grazing animals. Continue climbing; when the chalk path gives way to grass, you’re almost there. On reaching the top of the Downs head towards the fence to be rewarded with glorious views of the sea. The town straight ahead of you is Newhaven. Day or night, there is an otherworldliness to being up on the Downs. These hills were once believed to be the playground of fairies, goblins and that most mischievous and ancient of spirits, Puck. A “Puckhill” was listed in local parish records close to here as early as 1350. Many a strange encounter has been reported on the Downs. An hour’s drive to the west, Chanctonbury Ring has long held a reputation as a meeting place for witches, and unearthly sightings of demons and the like. A few miles away, on a walk around the lost village of Balsdean, Sussex folk singer Shirley Collins saw a ghostly apparition of a group of Roman soldiers, which she writes about in her book All In the Downs. And it was here above Firle, 81 years ago, that shepherd Fred Fowler had a life-changing experience. “Mine’s a simple life,” he told the Daily Mirror on 8 November 1940. “I just have me two dogs, me sheep and me missus way back at the cottage and I come to church on a Sunday. That’s all I sees or knows of life; that’s all I really want to see or know.” Yet, in broad daylight, Fowler had a vision of Christ on the cross, surrounded by six angels, in the sky above Firle Beacon. “It be like what they tells me cinema is like, but I think it be more real,” Fowler concluded. Despite three other residents recounting that they too had seen the vision above the Downs, Firle’s vicar, the paper noted, dismissed it all as “nonsense”. Keeping your feet on the ground but your eyes on the heavens, continue east across the top of the Downs for nearly a mile, passing a few copses and ignoring paths leading to the left or right until the trail drops sharply to a couple of gates, a tarmac road and the Bo-peep car park. Follow the road – you won’t encounter much traffic – to the bottom. In daylight, you may be treated to spectacular views of red kites, buzzards and ravens. At night it could be a barn or tawny owl quartering the fields. On reaching Bo-peep Farmhouse, follow a clear sign west to Charleston and Firle. The track cuts across open farmland, with the South Downs on your left and another Raviliousesque landscape of muted colours, undulating lines, wide-open spaces and rolling hills. After a mile, you’ll see a pretty house with cathedral-shaped windows. Skirt round it, keeping the house on your right and take a sheltered, tree-lined path. Reaching a gate, the path ascends slightly to the triangle of tracks and tree from the beginning of the walk. Retrace your steps, with that long flint wall on your right now, as the path curves back towards the village and the Ram Inn. This lovely 500-year-old pub has dark walls, stone floors, open fires and fine local brew Harvey’s on tap. There are three dining areas, a large grassy back garden and a front “beach” – though it’s so popular it’s worth booking. Despite operating principally as a gastropub (on the inside at least), the Ram retains plenty of character and charm. The fare, made with locally sourced ingredients, might include grilled sea trout, braised shoulder of lamb, mussels, mixed nut roast and roast haunch of Heathfield venison (£14-£18). But who’s the guy at the bar dressed like Crocodile Dundee? That’s local clergyman, pilgrim and TV presenter Peter Owen Jones. If you do happen to have a Blakean vision on the Downs, slip this vicar a pint of Harvey’s and he, at least, will be all ears. The Ram has five individually designed rooms styled with contemporary furniture and local antiques. Three have freestanding baths; four are dog-friendly. The most luxurious ones – which also offer the best views of the Downs, should you be inspired to bring your easel – are Beacon View and Bloomsbury.Doubles from £130 B&B Thanks to author Martine McDonagh for invaluable help with the route David Bramwell is co-author of Cheeky Walks in Brighton and Sussex",Lifestyle/Travel,"A great walk to a great pub: the Ram Inn, Firle, South Downs",https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/jan/28/a-great-walk-to-a-great-pub-the-ram-inn-firle-south-downs
1/28/2022,"Microsoft’s second attempt at its interesting dual-screen Android smartphone corrects some mistakes of the original, but falls short of a revolution due to a series of oddities created by its physical laptop-like form. Looking more like a tiny convertible computer than a phone, the Surface Duo 2 starts at £1,349 ($1,499/A$2,319), a lot for a regular smartphone but slightly cheaper than folding-screen rivals.  It opens like a book, with each half just 5.5mm thick, and a hinge that allows it to fold all the way over. Inside are a pair of 90Hz OLED screens each measuring 5.8in on the diagonal. They can be used on their own or combined as one display measuring 8.3in – a similar size to an iPad mini. Both screens are covered in traditional scratch-resistant smartphone glass and have large, old-fashioned bezels top and bottom. Having two separate displays rather than one that folds in half creates a major drawback: a gap in the middle of the screen big enough that you can see through it, which is much harder to ignore than the crease in the middle of a flexible display as found on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3. You can use two different apps at the same time on the two screens. The theory is sound, but I found few pairings were useful beyond simple messaging apps and a browser. More useful was using one screen for a note-taking app and the other for a full keyboard like a mini laptop. Some apps spanned across both displays, like Outlook, can put different information on each screen, such as your inbox on one side and an open message on the other. Some games, including Asphalt 9 and Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass streaming service, put controls on one screen and the action on the other. But there are very few apps and games optimised for this setup. Screens: two 5.8in AMOLED 90Hz displays Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 RAM: 8GB of RAM Storage: 128, 256 or 512GB Operating system: Android 11 Cameras: 12MP wide, 16MP ultra-wide, 12MP 2x telephoto; 12MP selfie Connectivity: 5G, USB-C, wifi 6, NFC, Bluetooth 5.1 and location Water resistance: IPX1 (dripping water) Dimensions closed: 145.2 x 92.1 x 11.0mm Dimensions open: 145.2 x 184.5 x 5.5mm Weight: 284g The Duo 2 has last year’s top Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chip with 8GB of RAM, matching the performance of top-flight Android smartphones from 2021 and capable of running two apps running side-by-side without slowdown. Battery life is more variable than a traditional phone. It lasts about 32 hours between charges, with both screens used for about four hours with a variety of messaging, browsing and work apps. It lasts about a third longer if you mostly use only one screen. That’s a considerably shorter battery life than a regular smartphone and behind the Z Fold 3. Microsoft does not provide an expected lifespan for the Duo 2’s battery; those in similar devices typically maintain at least 80% of their original capacity for in excess of 500 full charge cycles. Microsoft charges an out-of-warranty service fee of £593.94 to repair devices and £568.44 to replace the battery. The previous generation Surface Duo scored only two out of 10 on iFixit’s repairability scale. The phone contains no recycled materials, but Microsoft operates recycling schemes for old devices, publishes a company-wide sustainability report and a breakdown of each product’s environmental impact. The Duo 2 runs Android 11 – not the latest Android 12 – and generally behaves like a standard Android smartphone or tablet with a few small additions that make it easier to use each screen separately. One of the best is the ability to drag the gesture bar at the bottom of an app to move it between screens or to drop it on to the gap between the screens to span it across both displays. The software can be a bit unpredictable at times, such as opening the keyboard or text box of an app on another screen or hiding a second app from the screen when you try to type. But it is generally a fast and responsive experience given how unusual the device is. The Duo 2 will receive three years of software updates from release, including monthly security patches, which is disappointingly at least a year short of what rivals, including Samsung and Apple, offer. Microsoft’s last planned update for the Duo 2 will be 21 October 2024. The Duo 2 has a triple camera on the back and a 12-megapixel selfie camera above the right-hand screen. The rear main 12MP camera and 2x telephoto cameras are good, capable of producing detailed shots in a range of lighting conditions. The 16MP ultra-wide camera is reasonable, but a bit soft on detail and struggles with challenging scenes. The camera app has most of the features you’d expect, such as portrait mode, night mode and slow-mo video, and can shoot regular video at up to 4K at 60 frames a second. The 12MP selfie camera is capable of shooting detailed photos even in middling light, and has access to the dedicated night mode when it gets dark. Overall, the camera system on the Duo 2 is solid, but it can’t hold a candle to the best in the business. The Duo 2 supports Microsoft’s Slim Pen stylus, which can be magnetically stored and charged on the back of the device when not in use. The stereo speakers are decently loud but a bit tinny, fine for watching YouTube videos. The width of the device makes it a challenge to fit into smaller pockets. The Surface Duo 2 costs £1,349 ($1,499/A$2,319) with 128GB, £1,429 ($1,599/A$2,469) with 256GB or £1,589 ($1,799/A$2,769) with 512GB of storage. For comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 costs £1,599 and the Galaxy Z Flip 3 costs £949. The Surface Duo 2 is an improvement on its predecessor, but is still a very odd proposition that’s neither a good phone nor a good tablet. The individual screens are short and stout, forcing lots of scrolling in apps when using it like a phone and making one-handed use very difficult. The gap at the hinge makes combining them into one big tablet screen awkward too. Using two apps side-by-side works well, but few combinations proved useful or faster than just quick switching between two apps on one screen on a normal phone. There is more potential in apps like Outlook that provide a multi-pane view, but few apps or games are optimised for the dual-screen system. Microsoft is only offering a disappointing three years of software and security updates from release for the Duo 2, too, losing it a star. It is good to see Microsoft trying something different. But ultimately the Duo 2’s two screens are just not yet as good or useful as either a single phone screen or a bigger folding screen, making it an expensive halfway house. Pros: two screens, two apps side-by-side, multiple modes, top performance, hardened glass screens, decent camera, head-turning design. Cons: gap between screens, few optimised apps, average battery life, bulky camera lump, chunky in pocket, hard to use one-handed, no real water resistance, only three years of software updates from release.

1/28/2022,"Leaked chats of the US white supremacist group Patriot Front have revealed the day-to-day organizing of a far-right gang desperate for new members as it seeks a higher profile in the US with provocative public marches. More than 400 gigabytes of private communications from chat logs on RocketChat, an alt-tech platform favored by far-right groups, were obtained and published by Unicorn Riot, a left-wing nonprofit media organization that reports on social movements.  The chat logs reveal a group of men struggling to grow membership and being harangued by their leadership to maintain physical fitness, show up to events and contribute financially to the cause of white supremacy – all with limited success. It also shows how the group uses social media to make itself seem larger than it is. Chats indicate the white supremacist group has around 200 members. The messages show a coordinated effort to commit vandalism and intimidate people of color nationwide. The group requires members to deface racial justice murals and monuments to Black Lives Matter in their communities, much like a street gang that requires initiates to “tag” buildings as a form of vandalism and intimidation. Chats show that the group’s leaders regularly reprimand members for failing to meet exercise or participation requirements. It also shows a group fixated on getting more members, a task which it has found difficult. “We are absolutely desperate for new people. We’ve been in the 220’s to 230’s membership rut for nearly a full year,” wrote Thomas Rousseau, the founder of Patriot Front. Patriot Front garnered headlines and trended on social media this month after marching in uniform with shields alongside anti-abortion activists in Chicago and Washington D.C. The leaked chats reveal that the demonstrations were part of a strategy to recruit new members to the group. The chats outlined a plan to create fake social media accounts that would pose as bystanders to their marches. The fake accounts would then post deceptive material on platforms like Twitter, Reddit and 4chan. One pre-written tweet about Patriot Front’s 4 December march down the National Mall referred to “about 500 men with riot shields marching in #washingtondc” – but there were far fewer than that counted at the actual event. The chats also instructed members to direct message a mix of traditional media outlets and right-wing media figures, such as journalist Andy Ngo. “We’ve been trending all day since last night,” one member wrote. “Another news piece that mentions us,” said another. Patriot Front members rejoiced after being thrust into the national conversation. “We’re the news cycle, now. Everyone lean into your promotions,” wrote Rousseau. The Guardian has previously reported on how far-right groups face exposure from an army of hacktivists, which has crippled their ability to operate in secret and made membership in such groupsa risky proposition for anyone wishing to keep a low profile. Patriot Front formed out of Vanguard America, a white supremacist group, after it splintered following the deadly violence at the Charlottesville’s Unite the Right rally in 2017. While Vanguard America has largely gone quiet in the years since, Patriot Front has gone on to aggressively promote white nationalism. The group was responsible for 80% of the white supremacist propaganda incidents tracked by the Anti-Defamation League in 2020. Rousseau requires Patriot Front members to distribute the group’s stickers weekly, and upload photos to an internal channel as proof they’ve done an assignment. It also requires members to buy the stickers from him directly at a markup. “If any of the prices seem above market rate it’s because it also goes toward paying for our servers, our digital accounts and subscriptions, and the food I can afford to eat,” wrote Rousseau. One member complained that their region was “single-handedly paying Thomas’ rent” with the amount of stickers they were buying. Rousseau and other regional directors frequently scold members for not participating in events. “You are obligated by membership in this organization to attend the demos, unless a valid excuse is given. Simply wishing not to attend is not a valid excuse. If you have any issues, get them resolved or you can talk to Thomas” one regional director wrote to a member who failed to attend a meetup . The group has one member designated as a ‘fitness coordinator’ who polices the exercise regimen of members. “[I]t’s important to be fit and healthy, he will call out men who are not following the routine in front of everybody,” one chat log reads. Recruits have to answer a list of questions that probe everything from their ideological commitment to white supremacy to their physical and mental health. The chats reveal a group obsessed with their public image, enforcing strict uniform standards for its members during demonstrations. Members are also required to wear masks to “encourage uniformity and unanimity” and “protect the individuals against state repression, but also purify the message so people have to focus on the deeds/words of men not their identities,” according to one chat log.",News/World news,‘We are desperate for new people’: inside a hate group’s leaked online chats,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/28/leaked-online-chats-white-nationalist-patriot-front
1/28/2022,"Denise Coates, head of gambling empire Bet365, was Britain’s biggest taxpayer last year, according to the Sunday Times Tax List. The Coates family paid an estimated £481.7m, topping the annual ranking of billionaires’ tax payments for the third consecutive year. While the family’s tax payment was down from £573m in 2020, it was still almost £200m more that paid by hedge fund manager Chris Rokos in second-place with a £300m payment to the exchequer.  The total tax paid by the top 50 taxpayers rose by £510m to £3.7bn up from £3.2bn the previous year. The minimum amount of tax paid needed to make the top 50 rose to £15.2m, up 16% on the previous year. “This is a stronger Tax List than last year’s – which will be good news for the chancellor,” Robert Watts, compiler of the list, said. “The total take is up by more than £500m” However, the IPPR thinktank, which is campaigning for a wealth tax, said the list provides “an insight into the UK’s broken tax system” which allows “the richest people in the country to pay little to no tax at all”. “Only one name from the top 10 of last year’s [Sunday Times] Rich List appear among those thought to be the top 10 taxpayers,” George Dibb, head of the IPPR’s centre for economic justice, said. “Our tax system, which supports the NHS and welfare safety net, should ensure that those with the broadest shoulders bear the biggest burden. But today it’s just too easy for some of the richest people in the country to pay little to no tax at all. ” Dibb pointed out that of the top 10 richest people in the UK, only the Weston family (the 10th richest with £11bn) appear on the tax list. The richest person in the UK according to the Sunday Times’ rich list is Sir Len Blavatnik, a Ukrainian-born businessman who made his money from energy and aluminium groups in the former Soviet Union, with an estimated £23bn fortune. He is not included in the tax list. Coates, 54, who paid herself £421m last year, has built up an estimated £8.4bn fortune from Bet365 making her the 17th richest person in the country. Her pay since 2016 totals almost £1.3bn. Rokos, 51, who runs $13bn hedge fund Rokos Capital Management, paid £300m in tax after he collected £509m in pay from the hedge fund that made almost £1bn in profit from bets placed during the pandemic. The fund made £914m in profit in the year to 31 March 2021 according to filings at Companies House. Stephen Rubin, 84, whose family is behind the JD Sports high street chain and sportswear brands Speedo, Berghaus and Kickers, paid £256m. Behind him, the Weston family, which owns Fortnum & Masons and recently sold Selfridges for £4bn, paid £175.4m. Rounding out the top five are Fred and Peter Done, who paid about £170m in tax from their gambling business Betfred. More than £100m of that tax take is made up of specific gambling taxes including betting duty (£55.1m), machine gaming duty (£38.1m) and the statutory betting levy (£8.4m). The most notable of the 10 new entries in this year’s list is Lord Sugar. The Apprentice host ranks sixth this year off the back of his £163.4m tax bill, largely made up of a £148.6m dividend tax exposure that followed his £390m dividend payment from his Amshold Ltd property business. JK Rowling paid £36m in tax, bringing to £119.4m the amount she has paid in tax over the past three years. Rowling has said she makes a conscious decision to pay full taxes in the UK, refusing to live in “the limbo of some tax haven” and criticising “greedy tax exiles”. Rowling, who received single mother benefits when she was writing the first Harry Potter book, has previously spoken of the debt she felt she owed to the welfare state. “When my life hit rock bottom, that safety net, threadbare though it had become, was there to break the fall,” she said. “It would have been contemptible to scarper to the West Indies at the first sniff of a seven-figure royalty cheque.”",News/Business,Head of Bet365 gambling firm Denise Coates tops list of UK’s biggest taxpayers,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/28/head-of-bet365-gambling-firm-denise-coates-tops-list-of-uks-biggest-taxpayers
1/28/2022,"Hello. Yes, it’s Friday, and this is Warren Murray bringing you news upon which to muse.  Boris Johnson has been told it is “time for the truth to be released” as he faced more calls to publish a long-awaited report into “partygate” in full and not “suppress crucial details”. Anticipation reached fever pitch early this week of its arrival but some Tories believe the report will not be released until early next week. Sue Gray, the senior civil servant compiling the report, is said to want to send it in a state that can be published by Downing Street in full, without further redactions. “We are in no way seeking to block the report,” the prime minister’s spokesperson said. “It remains our intention to publish the report as it is received from the investigation.” Allies of the prime minister believe the longer-than-expected wait for the official civil service investigation is proving helpful for him, because it is letting anger in the party ebb. One Tory critic feared Johnson would “wriggle out of the scrutiny he deserves once again”. Fears of NICs U-turn – The Treasury is becoming increasingly alarmed that Boris Johnson may be preparing to scrap the national insurance rise as he fights to save his job. The Guardian understands the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has stressed to MPs that it must go ahead. Speaking in Wales on Thursday, when asked to confirm explicitly that the increase would go ahead as planned, Johnson declined to do so. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, told the BBC on Thursday that there would be “no U-turn” on the rise. The 1.25 percentage point rise in national insurance contributions (NICs) is badged a “health and social care levy” and is meant to bolster funding for the NHS and social care. UK falls behind on protecting antibiotics – The reputation of British farming is at risk after its failure to follow the EU in curbing the overuse of antibiotics in healthy animals, say campaigners. From today, a ban on giving antibiotics to groups of healthy animals comes into force across the EU. UK ministers have previously refused to commit to an outright ban on preventive use. Antibiotic overuse is the main driver of antimicrobial resistance, one of the biggest threats to human and animal health. About two-thirds of antibiotics globally are given to animals. The government’s Veterinary Medicines Directorate said it would set out proposed regulatory changes as part of a public consultation during 2022. Hate crime accused in court – A teenager is to appear in court today charged with racially aggravated actual bodily harm after two Jewish men were attacked in north London on Wednesday, the night before Holocaust Memorial Day. Police were called at 9.50pm on Wednesday to a road in Haringey after receiving reports that two men had been assaulted. Both were taken to a north London hospital to be treated. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan police said the incident was being treated as a hate crime. ‘Honoured to be a part of change’ – Inflo, the genre-straddling producer known for work with Adele, Little Simz and Michael Kiwanuka, has been announced as producer of the year in 2022’s Brit awards. It is the first time a non-white artist has won the award since the inception of the Brits in 1977. “I feel honoured to be a part of change,” said Inflo, whose real name is Dean Josiah Cover. “All the Black producers before me, I’m in awe and have studied you. I am you. Thank you for both paving the way and for your integral contribution to British music.” Inflo will receive his award at the Brits ceremony on 8 February at the O2 Arena, London. Adele, Ed Sheeran, Little Simz and Dave are top of the nominations, with four each. Sight for more eyes – The crumbling medieval fortress at Barnard Castle had a record number of visitors last year after gaining notoriety as the destination of Dominic Cummings on a lockdown mission to test his eyesight, according to English Heritage.
