1/26/2022,"With the clock ticking inexorably down to Deadline Day and Newcastle still desperate to get new recruits in the door, fans who have spent the past few months crowing about the wealth of their new Saudi owners now seem weirdly surprised by the notion clubs who currently employ players they are interested in might want to take them for a ride. Eddie Howe has insisted the club will “draw a line” on prospective deals if they feel they are being rinsed by opportunistic rivals, in a stance likely to be tested to within an inch of its life over the next few days. But, for now, it seems they have abandoned all hope of bringing Jesse Lingard to St James’ Park for the remaining six months of his contract because they feel Manchester United are taking massive liberties by asking for a £10m loan fee.  Robin Gosens is another player who has been repeatedly linked with a move to Tyneside in the current window but the Atalanta left-back looks set to join Inter for £21m, while Sevilla continue to play hardball over Diego Carlos and have turned down yet another bid for the Brazilian central defender and declared he is not for sale. Newcastle have also tabled an offer of £33m for in-demand Lyon midfielder Bruno Guimarães, who would rather go to Arsenal or Juventus. Despite giving him very limited game time, Manchester United interim boss Ralf Rangnick doesn’t want to let Donny van de Beek leave Old Trafford. The frustrated midfielder is believed to have other ideas and may stamp his feet until he is allowed to go to Crystal Palace or Valencia on loan. The south London club are believed to be in the box seat, with transfer guru Fabrizio Romano reporting that they have “submitted a straight loan proposal” to United. Currently representing Morocco at the Africa Cup of Nations, where his side booked their berth in the last eight with a win over Malawi, Sofyan Amrabat may be off to Tottenham on loan. The Fiorentina midfielder has been identified as a replacement for the Paris Saint-Germain-bound Tanguy Ndombele and will go on loan with an option to buy in the summer for £12m. Spurs seem less likely to sign Luis Díaz, having had a bid rejected by Porto for their Colombian winger. The slump in form being endured by Dele Alli hasn’t put off a raft of Premier League suitors who are willing to take a punt on the notion that a change of scenery might help the Tottenham midfielder rediscover his long-departed mojo. Burnley, Brighton, Newcastle, Everton and Southampton are all believed to be interested in giving the out-of-sorts-but-undeniably-gifted midfielder a chance to resurrect his stagnating career. Brentford have upped their bid for Nottingham Forest midfielder Brennan Johnson, who showcased his skills to a wider audience during his side’s win over Derby last weekend. Meanwhile in Lancashire, Burnley are in advanced talks with Dinamo Zagreb regarding the prospect of bringing Croatia midfielder Mislav Orsic to Turf Moor. Along with Newcastle and Crystal Palace, Burnley are also being linked with a move for Juventus outcast Aaron Ramsey, who will be keen on getting game time unlikely to be afforded to him by his current employers before the first of two potential World Cup eliminators for Wales in March.",Sport/Football,Football transfer rumours: Burnley to land Aaron Ramsey and Mislav Orsic?,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/26/football-transfer-rumours-burnley-to-land-aaron-ramsey-and-mislav-orsic
1/26/2022,"Football played by human beings is not like a Madden game, where the “progressive fatigue” factor can be switched off. The players we like to think of as giant Energizer Bunnies get tired. Case in point: the Buffalo Bills defense on Sunday. The Kansas City Chiefs, the Bills’ opponents in an exhilarating AFC divisional round playoff game, ran 16 plays in their final three possessions. The Chiefs covered 194 yards and scored two touchdowns, plus a field goal that they needed to send the game into overtime. They faced third down on only two of those 16 plays, converting both.  After the Chiefs scored a touchdown on the first possession of overtime to win, 42-36, the grumbling began: the Bills should have been given a chance to match that touchdown. But that is not how the NFL rules for overtime work. Should they be changed? Maybe. Maybe not. “I love the concept of sudden death,” Rick Gosselin, who covered the NFL for decades for the Dallas Morning News, tells the Guardian. “In hockey, after one team scores a goal in overtime, does the other team get the chance to match it?” Gosselin adds: “There are three elements of football: offense, defense and special teams. Build a defense that can force a punt in overtime. Giving both teams a possession favors the offenses. If you want to go all in on offense, keep winning those coin tosses. If you want to win a championship, build a defense that can be as effective as your offense for 60 minutes and beyond.” Suppose Buffalo had answered with a touchdown, which, considering this game, was quite possible. Then what? Then the next score wins? Declare a tie and schedule a replay? A penalty shootout? As much fun as this game was, these guys can’t play on forever. A day after the game, Kansas City coach Andy Reid said of both teams getting at least one possession in overtime: “I wouldn’t be opposed to it. It’s a hard thing. It was great for us last night, but is it great for the game which is the most important thing we should all be looking out for? To make things equal, it probably needs to be able to hit both offenses, both defenses.” Much attention afterward went to Buffalo quarterback Josh Allen’s final play of the day: calling tails to lose the coin flip that decided which team would get the ball first in overtime. Had the Bills won the toss, Allen very well might have marched Buffalo to a winning touchdown. After all, he had been magnificent, driving the Bills for two touchdowns on Buffalo’s last two possessions of the game. The Chiefs’ defense was gassed, too, giving up a total of 150 yards in 23 plays. Allen gained 23 vital yards on six valiant scrambles on the first fourth-quarter drive. He did not deserve to lose the game. “We should never let a football game be determined from a coin,” Bills left tackle Dion Dawkins said. “Like, I think that’s the most craziest rule in sports. Like, you can fight your entire fight the whole game, and then the game comes down to a 50-50 chance of a coin toss. Like, this ain’t Vegas. Like, we’re not at the casino table. Like, this ain’t no 50-50 bet and there ain’t even no 50-50 bet. And it’s just crazy that that was the outcome.” That is an A-plus quote, but the coin flip did not determine the winner, just the first team to get the chance to score a touchdown. Had Kansas City managed only a field goal, or punted, Buffalo would have got their chance. The Bills knew the rules. Only two players on the Kansas City defense – cornerback L’Jarius Sneed and safety Juan Thornhill – played all 64 snaps. Meanwhile, seven Buffalo players played all 76 of their team’s defensive snaps. Kansas City used 21 players on defense, compared with 17 for the Bills. There is also the question of how the Bills let the game go to overtime in the first place. All the Bills needed to do was to keep the Chiefs out of field-goal range (or from completing a Hail Mary pass) on their last drive of regulation. Kansas City, starting from their own 25-yard line, gained 44 yards in two plays covering 10 seconds before kicking the tying field goal. Much to their credit, many members of Bills’ Mafia took to social media to comment that Buffalo were way too mushy on those two plays, refusing to jam the Chiefs’ receivers at the line of scrimmage to make it harder for them to get open. Others have suggested that the Bills should have squibbed the kickoff before that drive, starting the clock when the ball was touched, rather than booming it into the end zone for a touchback. (That strategy carries risks: What if the kick goes out of bounds, or only 15 yards, or is returned for a touchdown?) In any case, special teams helped determine the outcome – the way it should be. The procedure in college football, which does not use kickoffs or punts in overtime, is lacking. Beginning with the third overtime period, teams alternate two-point conversion tries, not even full 25-yard drives. Even 21-year-olds only have so much energy. As delightful as Sunday’s game was to watch, it is unrealistic to expect much more than what we got from men who had rammed into or run around each other for 3 hours 15 minutes, running up 974 total yards of offense – especially coming after a newly extended 17-game season. Prior to Sunday, the most notable playoff game using these overtime rules came in Super Bowl LI five years ago, when the New England Patriots scored on the first possession of overtime to beat Atlanta, 34-28. The Falcons did not get much sympathy after the game, because they had a 28-3 lead late in the third quarter and got five chances to stop Tom Brady. The Chiefs scored on six of seven possessions after halftime. The Bills had enough chances to win the game. Why should have they gotten another chance, just because the shootout narrative demanded it? Rules are rules, and life is not always fair, as humans say.

1/26/2022,"Australia is considering supplying extra liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe after the US and the UK raised fears the continent’s reliance on Russia makes it vulnerable in a growing standoff with Vladimir Putin. With more than 100,000 Russian troops massing near the border with Ukraine, the US said it was working with allies and partners to prepare financial sanctions “with massive consequence” if the Russian president decided to invade the eastern European country.  A senior Biden administration official revealed the US was also “looking at the global flow of LNG – whether it’s from the United States or from Australia or from other places”. Qatar is also part of the energy supply talks. “The conversation is really broad with a lot of companies and countries around the world,” the administration official said at a background press briefing. The official said Russia had already restricted the flow of gas through the pipeline running through Ukraine from about 100m cubic metres a day to 50m. The Australian resources minister, Keith Pitt, said Australia was “a leading and reliable global exporter of LNG” and “stands ready to assist with any request for further supplies”. “This shows how important Australian resources are to energy supplies around the world,” Pitt said in a statement. The plans come after the UK also raised concerns about Germany’s reliance on Russian gas. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, said one of the “big issues we all face” in crafting a strong sanctions package against Russia was “the heavy dependence, of our European friends in particular, on Russian gas”. He said the UK was “in a stronger position to resist the Russian gas blackmail”. “We have to be respectful of this, but the simple fact is that about 3% of the UK’s gas supplies come from Russia, whereas about 36% of German energy needs come from Russian gas,” Johnson told the House of Commons on Tuesday. “We are working together with president Biden and other colleagues to see what we can do to increase the supply of gas both to Europe and of course to this country.” The British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who visited Australia for talks last week, said a further military incursion by Russia into Ukraine would trigger “coordinated sanctions”. “We are working with allies and partners across the world because this is a threat not just to Europe, but to broader global stability,” she said. Truss warned of “the response we will see from other authoritarian regimes around the world if Putin is allowed to get away with what he is seeking to do”. “That is why it is important that we work with allies, from Japan to India to Australia, as well as the United States and our Nato allies, to strengthen our resolve and our security and to make it absolutely clear that none of these regimes will succeed,” Truss said. The Australian government has called for a de-escalation of tensions and has left the door open to imposing sanctions on Russian officials in the event of an invasion of Ukraine. The foreign minister, Marise Payne, described sanctions as “a potential tool” Australia and like-minded countries could use “to convey our very strong concerns about such aggressive behaviour”. Russia’s ambassador to Australia, Alexey Pavlovsky, brushed off the threat of Australian sanctions, saying it would not have any effect on Moscow’s position. “Sanctions just don’t work,” Pavlovsky told ABC Radio National on Wednesday. He denied that the Russian troop buildup showed any intention to invade Ukraine, arguing it would be “a funny way to prepare an invasion – just gather troops on the border and just let them sit there for months”. “These troops are not a threat, they are a warning – a warning to Ukraine’s rulers not to attempt any reckless military adventures.” Russia’s foreign ministry has pushed for “security guarantees”, including the retreat of Nato from all countries that joined the alliance after 1997. It has also sought a guarantee that Ukraine never be admitted to Nato. Some western analysts have said the sweeping demands seemed designed to fail. Pavlovsky said the Australian government’s position, and its decision to remove family members of diplomats from its embassy in Ukraine, was “regrettable”. “Thirty years ago Nato forces were thousands of miles away from Russian borders and now they are just around the corner,” Pavlovsky said. “I fully understand that some countries situated thousands of miles away might find it difficult to appreciate our concerns, but for Russia it’s not a situation which is thousands of miles away.” The Australian government says it is not considering sending troops or military assets in the event of a conflict but insists it is offering “absolute and steadfast support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”. Australia has also flagged its willingness to help Ukraine fend off cyber-attacks. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The defence minister, Peter Dutton, said on Tuesday that Russia was “obvious in its intent, amassing troops on the border”, and he predicted “bloody scenes” if it invaded Ukraine. The comments follow the Australian government’s decision on Monday to urge any Australian citizens to leave Ukraine immediately because “flight availability could change or be suspended at short notice”. But Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, appealed for calm, telling parliament an invasion was not imminent and people should “sleep well”.",News/World news,Australia could send extra gas to Europe as Russia cuts supplies due to Ukraine tensions,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/australia-could-send-extra-gas-to-europe-as-russia-cuts-supplies-due-to-ukraine-tensions
1/26/2022,"Just one glance was enough. In 1974, Prince Philip was returning from a holiday in the south Pacific when he became a god. Midway through the journey, the royal yacht Britannia was anchored off the island of Aneityum. Villagers from Tanna, a neighbouring island, paddled out in their canoes to catch a glimpse of him. “I saw him standing on the deck in his white uniform,” Jack Naiva, the chief of the Yaohnanen people until 2009, said in a later interview. “I knew then that he was the true messiah.” Haile Selassie I, the Ethiopian king, didn’t even need to be seen to be perceived as divine. In 1931, National Geographic ran a 68-page report on his coronation in Addis Ababa. Preachers and pamphleteers read the article in faraway colonial Jamaica and proclaimed him their ordained saviour, a manifestation of the “black divine”. A baroque magazine piece – written by, of all people, the then US consul-general to Ethiopia – became a gospel for generations of believers who called themselves “Rastafarians” after Selassie’s birth name: Tafari Makonnen (“Ras”, a title, was bestowed later). By the 1950s, the anthropologist George Eaton Simpson reported that men were proselytising on the streets of Kingston with the Bible in one hand and a “weathered copy” of the magazine in another. Never mind that Selassie didn’t consider himself “black”, or the fact that National Geographic routinely ran pieces that referred to indigenous people as “savages”, and African Americans were forbidden from becoming members or using its library in Washington DC. As Anna Della Subin notes in Accidental Gods, the cult of the utopian Rastas was born in a crib of contradictions, “among those in the new world living in the obscenity of injustice”.  Subin traces tall tales of these inadvertent deities at exhaustive length: Koreans worshipping statues of General MacArthur after the 1950 war; Hawaiian tribesmen revering Captain Cook as a supernatural being after bludgeoning him to death; residents of Papua and New Guinea voting for the US president Lyndon B Johnson in an election. Again and again, a link is made between the effects of modernity – rudderless secularism, ruthless empires and capitalism – and the fervour with which, in reaction, these men end up being immortalised. The script of accidental divinity remains the same over centuries: a stranger, usually white or powerful, becomes a symbol, then an object of veneration, part of an ongoing local power struggle, a conduit for an idea not necessarily his own. Faith, for Subin, is invariably an allegory for something else. This approach can be taken too far. A group described by one contemporary observer as “Maratha simpletons”, for instance, might have been worshipping a statue of Lord Wellesley on an elephant in colonial Bombay. What seems more plausible, however, is that they were just worshipping the elephant. Ganesh, the Hindu elephant god, is, after all, a household deity in the region, and pilgrims flock to Mumbai’s beaches every September to immerse effigies. Subin discerns anti-imperial resistance in everything from Sudanese djinns, or supernatural beings (“a way to contend with the invasion of a foreign force”), to shamanic rituals in colonial Ghana (a counterpart to “the rhetoric of politicians, of colonial discourse”), and even the notion of being possessed by spirits (an idea “born at the crossroads of enslavement and enlightenment”). Deification, she repeatedly asserts, is a “form of defiance”. History and hysteria coalesce in oral testimonies of MacArthur appearing in Koreans’ dreams years after his death, and French colonial officials mysteriously frothing at the mouth in Niger. In India, Subin digs up 18th-century reports of British soldiers’ graves in India being “consecrated” by Hindu rituals, and teenage widows purportedly dissenting against the Raj by campaigning for their right to immolate themselves on their husbands’ funeral pyres. But is all as it seems? At least two older white writers tell Subin about visiting an isolated community or tribe and being confused for someone celestial. What might just as well be traditional gestures of curiosity and hospitality – being asked endless questions, say, or being welcomed with offerings of food and incense – are written up by western travellers as signs of their own cosmic importance, and Subin accepts these accounts uncritically.That said, her portrait of the Rastafarian movement is wonderfully attuned to the transformative power of belief. Despite their obsession with Selassie, Rasta activists did propel Michael Manley to power in Jamaica, and it was Manley who first ushered in the reforms – labour rights, free education, universal healthcare – necessary for a colony to effectively transition to democracy. Another chapter on the theosophist Annie Besant and her protege, Jiddu Krishnamurti, brilliantly dissects their troubled relationship. In India, when Subin isn’t construing the slightest presence of “turmeric and lime” on colonial-era tombstones as evidence of deification, or insisting that it was Besant who first called Gandhi a mahatma or “great soul” (actually, it was either the poet Rabindranath Tagore or an anonymous Indian journalist), she can persuasively describe how British historical writing repeated the same stories of colonels and viceroys being worshipped in shrines – how the idea of white divinity mattered more to the empire than to the natives. But the overarching thesis doesn’t quite impress. The problem with positing divinity as a defence against encroaching modernity is that it only reinforces stale dichotomies: a scientifically advanced west, a permanently backward east. Belief, in this vision, is still the exclusive domain of the oppressed and the enslaved; India is still a land of gods and snakes. It’s all very well dwelling on Bussa Krishna, an Indian villager who stopped eating after Donald Trump contracted Covid-19 in 2020, but how does Subin avoid mentioning the overwhelmingly white followers of QAnon in the US, who believe that John F Kennedy Jr will come back to life? Subin may portray individual white gods as delusional narcissists and racists and imperialists, but white people, in the aggregate, still come across as oddly less deceived. Their superior scepticism is a myth that remains somewhat unchallenged in this otherwise subversive book.

1/26/2022,"Piotr Cywiński has spent a lot of time pondering a question that has exercised historians, philosophers and politicians ever since the end of the second world war. What lessons should we draw from one of the darkest pages in human history, the organised mass killing at Auschwitz? A 49-year-old Polish historian, Cywiński has been director of the Auschwitz Museum since 2006. His office is housed in a former hospital and pharmacy built for the camp’s SS guards, and his windows look out over a crematorium and gas chamber.  “The biggest task for remembrance today is to combat indifference,” he said in an interview ahead of the 77th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, which is also Holocaust Memorial Day, and is marked on Thursday. “You can massacre tens of thousands of Rohingya, you can put 1.5 million Uyghurs in camps, in Yemen people are suffering because they do not have anything to eat, and we don’t feel concerned in our world,” he said. Nazi Germany deported about 1.3 million people to Auschwitz and 1.1 million of them died there, 90% of them Jewish. The museum, on the edge of the Polish town of Oświęcim, is housed in the preserved original buildings of the Auschwitz concentration camp, and the ruins of the neighbouring Birkenau extermination camp. Cywiński said that while the events of the Holocaust could not be compared to the present day, “the silence of bystanders” is a topic he wants visitors to the museum to think about and apply to their own lives. As well as combatting a world in which indifference and ignorance about the Holocaust are rising, Cywiński also has to contend with the current Polish government, which has made a nationalist narrative emphasising Polish martyrdom and suffering a major part of its political message. The government funds the Auschwitz museum and appoints its director, and Cywiński’s tenure is up for renewal at the end of this year. Many fear he may be replaced by a more ideological pro-government figure, as has happened at some other Polish museums. The Polish culture ministry said it was “premature” to discuss whether he would be reappointed later this year. The Auschwitz Museum contains some of the most shocking and disturbing exhibits on display anywhere in the world. Once seen, they remain etched into the minds of many visitors for the rest of their lives: the two tonnes of human hair, the tens of thousands of shoes and the piles of suitcases with names scrawled on the sides, symbols of the false hope with which many arrived at the camp. Cywiński wants to retain these gruesome artefacts, aware of the dark power that radiates from their authenticity, but also to add a new part of the exhibition, that will focus on the SS and the Nazi camp administration. “We have to show that this was not an isolated place that suddenly appeared but it was a project that was created, built and grew during that time,” he said. At the ceremony to mark 75 years of liberation in 2020, Auschwitz survivor Marian Turski told the assembled dignitaries that “Auschwitz did not fall from the sky”. He warned of the dangers of discriminating against any minority. “Democracy hinges on the rights of minorities being protected,” he said. While the museum will remain firmly focused on the terrible events that happened there, Cywiński is this week launching the Auschwitz Pledge Foundation, which will distribute grants to groups across the world fighting indifference to hatred. The foundation’s general director, Jacek Kastelaniec, said projects that tackled antisemitism, racism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia and discrimination against migrants and refugees would all be eligible for funding. This is where things get tricky for Cywiński, given that he serves at the pleasure of a government that has frequently demonised refugees, and recently ran a presidential campaign based almost entirely around anti-LGBT rhetoric. In a 2017 speech at Auschwitz, the then prime minister, Beata Szydło, said the history of the camp showed that “everything must be done to defend the safety and the lives of citizens”. The remarks were widely interpreted as a defence of the government’s anti-migration policy. Last year, the government put Szydło on to the board of a council that oversees the Auschwitz Museum’s activities, leading three of its members to resign. “The basic idea of the historical policy the government represents is to whitewash anything that is seen as a problem in Polish history at that time … I was afraid that they would try to impose those attitudes,” said Stanisław Krajewski, a philosopher and Jewish community leader, who was one of those who resigned in protest at Szydło’s appointment. Cywiński said he did not have a problem with politicians being involved in the council, but said they should not have input into the narrative of the museum. He evaded a direct question about whether the inclusion of Szydło on the council has led to any changes or pressure. “Personally I try every time to keep this place far from politics. It’s a moral place, it’s not a place that should change every four or five years with elections,” he said. In written responses to questions, the Polish culture ministry said the appointment of Szydło “substantially strengthens the council and raises its importance” and that those who resigned had “no substantive justification” for doing so. It also noted part of a new exhibition at the Auschwitz museum, which will culminate in a list of more than 1,200 Poles who assisted prisoners at Auschwitz. More than 70,000 non-Jewish Poles also died at Auschwitz, and many in Poland feel that the overwhelming tragedy of the Holocaust has obscured the enormous Polish losses during the years of occupation and war. Inside the country, the government has focused overwhelmingly on Polish suffering, a narrative that means more Polish people now associate Auschwitz with “Polish martyrdom” than with “the destruction of the Jews”. Jan Grabowski, a Polish-Canadian historian, said Cywiński had gone too far in his cooperation with government-linked figures and institutions pushing this distorted version of history. “Auschwitz has become part and parcel of Polish history policy, in other words, transforming Auschwitz into part of the Polish feelgood narrative,” he said. Last year, Grabowski was forced to stand trial along with fellow historian Barbara Engelking over a book they co-authored that detailed instances of Polish complicity in Nazi crimes against Jews. (The appeals court overturned an initial ruling against them.) The government has tried to focus attention on cases of Poles who were killed for helping Jews. Cywiński said he did not see a problem with marking these heroes, but said: “We have to remember that others were supportive of the Nazi regime.” He criticised the increasing use of history by politicians, but took care to say it was a global problem and not just a Polish one. “When I turn on the television and I hear people speaking about history, 90% of the time it’s not a historian, it’s a politician. It was not like this 20 years ago,” he said. Cywiński would rather focus on how to get visitors to take lessons away from Auschwitz they can apply to their own lives. Many of the museum guides – of which there are currently 340 who work in 21 different languages – say that the best time to make visitors think about their own moral choices is when, overcome with the visceral horror of the museum exhibits, they ask why the world did not do more to stop the Holocaust from taking place. This is the perfect time to speak about “the silence of bystanders”, said Cywiński. “I cannot say to people, ‘Now you have to help Yemen’; ‘Now you should help the Uyghurs’. It is not my role to tell them what to do. But it is our role to help them ask the question, ‘What can I do in this world? Why is it a problem if I stay indifferent?’”",News/World news,‘The biggest task is to combat indifference’: Auschwitz Museum turns visitors’ eyes to current events,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/the-biggest-task-is-to-combat-indifference-auschwitz-museum-turns-visitors-eyes-to-current-events

1/26/2022,"Downing Street has still not yet seen the report by Sue Gray into alleged lockdown-breaking parties in government, Liz Truss has said. Asked if No 10 had yet to see the report by the senior civil servant, the foreign secretary said: “That’s correct. And, of course, it’s an independent report, it’s a matter for Sue Gray when she sends that report, when she’s completed her work.”  Boris Johnson also faces a parallel police investigation into whether any of the alleged gathering breached lockdown laws in place at the time, announced by the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, on Tuesday. Truss refused to say if Johnson would resign if he was interviewed under caution as part of the police inquiry, saying she would not get into “speculation”. “What I’m saying to you is that until we see the results of the investigation, the Sue Gray report and indeed the police investigation, it would be foolish to speculate,” she told Sky News. “We have to wait and see what is the outcome of the police investigation, in the same way that we have to wait and see what is the outcome of the Sue Gray report,” added Truss, who confirmed that she only knew about the police action after Tuesday’s cabinet meeting, although the prime minister knew about it beforehand. If Downing Street is yet to see the report on Wednesday morning, it means the publication could be pushed back until later in the week. Truss also declined to comment on whether Johnson would have to resign if it was found he had misled parliament when assuring MPs in December that no rules had been broken. “The prime minister has appeared before parliament,” she said. “He has apologised for what has happened. He’s admitted that mistakes were made. And I 100% support him and want him to continue as prime minister. “I’m not going to prejudice the findings of the Sue Gray report, or indeed the police investigation that is now taking place about what happened. What I’m saying is the prime minister has apologised.” Asked if the Gray report would be published in full, Truss reiterated that the only commitment was to release its “findings”. She said: “We don’t know the contents of the report. So there could be, for example, security issues that mean part of it are problematic to publish.” In a separate interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Truss was asked why Johnson had told parliament he knew nothing about parties, replying: “I simply don’t know what has gone on. This is why the Sue Gray inquiry was commissioned, to give us a clear picture of what has happened.” Pressed on whether she believed Johnson, Truss initially avoided the question, but eventually said: “I absolutely take the prime minister at his word.” She refused to say if Johnson should resign if fined by police: “I’m not going to answer hypothetical questions about a report that I haven’t seen, and an investigation that hasn’t been completed. I think that’s completely wrong.” Former No 10 staffers have told the Guardian that the police inquiry will uncover evidence which has not yet been submitted to Gray. One senior Tory said the Scotland Yard inquiry was a “different ballgame”, adding: “Officials who don’t tell Sue Gray the whole truth will not hold back from the cops.” Gray has interviewed witnesses and examined key evidence including security logs showing who was in Downing Street and when. She is also thought to have been shown photographs of parties though Cabinet Office sources stressed these were unlikely to be included in the report. It is understood the Met’s decision to investigate a number of parties in Downing Street and Whitehall was made on Sunday.

The 25-year-old’s contract runs out in the summer and she is free to negotiate with other clubs. Miedema has been with Arsenal since 2017 and the club sit top of the Women’s Super League but the Netherlands international says that winning the Champions League is a key priority for the next few years.  “In the coming weeks I have to get a certain feeling for the right club,” she told the Dutch newspaper AD, where she will be a columnist. “[But] the door to Arsenal is definitely not closed yet. “I want to win the Champions League. I want to get the most out of it [her career]. That means I may have to take the next step. I’m 25 and that’s still quite young, but I’ve been around for a while.” Miedema is regarded as one of the best footballers in the world and will be a target for the top European clubs. She has more than 100 Netherlands caps and will lead their line at the Euros this summer. “The years to come should officially be my peak years,” she said. “I have to spend it somewhere at a club that best suits my ambitions.” She added, however, that she was very happy in London, which is now her second home. “Life is good here. And I know myself: I have to be happy off the pitch to perform on the pitch.”",Sport/Football,Arsenal striker Vivianne Miedema holds talks with PSG and Barcelona,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/26/arsenal-striker-vivianne-miedema-holds-talks-with-psg-and-barcelona
1/26/2022,"More passengers took Wizz Air flights over the Christmas period despite the rise of the Omicron variant, and the carrier said it was cautiously optimistic about the continued recovery of air travel during the spring. The budget airline reported it carried 7.8 million passengers during the three months to the end of December, even more than it did in 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic, while its planes were more than three-quarters (77%) full.  The Hungary-based and London-listed carrier sounded an upbeat note in its trading statement to the London Stock Exchange despite reporting an operating loss of €213.6m (£179m) for the final three months of 2021. Wizz Air said it continued to take the hit from Covid travel restrictions, which hurt passenger demand. Despite this, the company has been ramping up its staff numbers, aircraft fleet, airport bases and routes before an anticipated full return to pre-pandemic flight levels by late spring. Airlines have been among the slowest companies to recover from the impact of the pandemic, amid shifting travel restrictions and Covid testing requirements. Wizz said in the summer of 2020 that it expected to become the first major European airline to recover capacity to pre-coronavirus levels. The airline carried three-and-a-half times more passengers during the festive season in 2021 than it did in late 2020, when much of the region was facing tough restrictions on travel. József Váradi, Wizz Air’s chief executive, said: “Despite the short-term headwinds, we are cautiously optimistic for a continued recovery into spring and near-full utilisation from summer onwards.” The airline said it had recruited more than 1,500 staff since the start of last summer, taking its total number of employees to 5,500 by January 2022, surpassing its pre-pandemic workforce. Wizz Air made 1,000 workers redundant in April 2020 and cut staff wages as Covid brought most international air travel to a halt. Wizz Air ended 2021 with a total of 150 aircraft, and took delivery of eight new Airbus A321neo planes. The company intends to have 500 planes by the end of this decade.",News/Business,Wizz Air passenger numbers rise to 7.8m despite Omicron fears,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/26/wizz-air-passenger-numbers-rise-despite-omicron-fears
1/26/2022,"Environmentalists are deeply concerned by the Kenyan government’s move to allow boundary changes to protected forests, watering down the powers of conservation authorities. The forest conservation and management (amendment) bill 2021 seeks to delete clause 34(2) from the 2016 act, which makes it mandatory for authorities to veto anyone trying to alter forest boundaries. The same clause protects forests from actions that put rare, threatened or endangered species at risk.  Tabled by the National Assembly’s procedure committee, the amendment would weaken the role of Kenya Forest Service, mandated to protect all public forests, allowing politicians to decide who can change forest boundaries. In an election year, many have read the proposal, due to be debated at the end of the month, as politically motivated. The committee’s memorandum to MPs said current laws “unnecessarily limit the rights of any Kenyan to petition parliament” as provided for in the constitution. But conservationists have said this would be a serious setback for the country, which was seeking to increase forest cover to 10% of land by 2022, up from 7.4%. Forest authorities said the move puts endangered species at risk, as well as clearing the way for unscrupulous individuals to encroach into forests that, according to a 2014 government paper, have been shrinking at a rate of 50,000 hectares (124,000 acres) annually. “I am astounded any right-thinking person would consider submitting or supporting such an amendment,” said Paula Kahumbu, chief executive at WildlifeDirect, a conservation NGO. “It will open the door to forest destruction after decades of hard work by agencies, communities and NGOs to increase forest cover, as committed to in our constitution. One can only read mischief in such a motion, with elections around the corner.” Kahumbu added: “At risk are indigenous forests and the biodiversity therein, the integrity of our water towers, generation of hydropower and productivity of our farms. The environmental experts of Kenya and the conservation community call on all citizens of Kenya to reach out to their MPs to wholeheartedly and aggressively reject this heinous bill.” She said the amendment would destroy the legacy of Wangari Maathai, the late environmentalist and Nobel Peace prize winner, who was once attacked and seriously wounded as she led a tree-planting exercise in Nairobi’s Karura Forest. In a tweet, Christian Lambrechts, executive director at Rhino Ark said: “Considering what Kenya has lost in the past, any change that weakens, rather than strengthens the mechanisms to protect our forests, is ill-advised.” Rhino Ark has been spearheading an initiative to put up electric fences around Kenya’s public forests to hamper poachers and illegal incursions. Dickson Kaelo, head of the Kenya Wildlife Conservancies Association, said the move by parliament is intended to “give legitimacy” to those who would destroy Kenya’s biodiversity. “This is a well-calculated move to open the doors for forest excisions and allocation to private persons for development, and may even be a means to normalise current excisions. It is a threat to our forests coming at a time when we have a low forest coverage and a high risk of climate crisis-induced vulnerabilities. We call upon parliament to reject the amendment,” said Kaelo. Protecting forests from developers has been a daunting task in Kenya. Last July, Joannah Stutchbury, a prominent environmental activist, was killed near her home in Nairobi after her protracted opposition to attempts by powerful businessmen to build on Kiambu forest near the capital, Nairobi. President Uhuru Kenyatta has yet to fulfil a promise to catch her killers.",News/Global development,"Planned change to Kenya’s forest act threatens vital habitats, say activists",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/26/kenya-forest-act-deforestation-environmental-activists
