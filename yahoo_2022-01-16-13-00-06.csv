1/16/2022,"Steve Bannon said that speakers at Donald Trump's rally will decertify Joe Biden's electors in Arizona. Law professors told Poynter there is no legal mechanism for decertifying the 2020 election results. Some Republicans want Arizona's election results decertified despite audits affirming Biden's win. On Saturday, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon released a new episode of his ""War Room"" podcast in which he claimed that the former president's rally on Saturday would serve as a precursor to the decertification of President Joe Biden's 2020 election win. ""It's the kickoff of 2022. A huge speech in front of a massive crowd by Donald J. Trump and, of course, they're all melting down about who's on stage with him. They're all people that are going to get to the decertification of the 2020 Biden electors,"" Bannon said. —Ron Filipkowski (@RonFilipkowski) January 15, 2022 Several individuals are slated to speak at the ""Save America"" rally in Florence, Arizona, including Mike Lindell, Paul Gosar, Andy Biggs, and several candidates running for public office in the state who have received Trump's endorsement. The event was scheduled after Trump canceled his January 6 speech at Mar-a-Lago, which his advisers said would result in bad press coverage and urged him against doing. ""I want to make sure Jamie Raskin, Bennie Thompson, all you guys write this down. Take your No. 2 pencils out. We're going to decertify, I didn't say we were going to certify Trump electors, but we're going to decertify Biden electors in Arizona, in Wisconsin, in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and in the great state of Georgia,"" Bannon said on his podcast. Law professors from Arizona State University told Poynter there is no legal mechanism to undo the appointment of electors or change a certification once a president has been sworn into office. Multiple GOP-led audits in the state also confirmed Biden's presidential win over Trump. Still, a handful of GOP officials in the Arizona legislature are calling on Gov. Doug Ducey and state senate President Karen Fann, both of whom are Republicans, to decertify the state's election results, the Arizona Capitol Times reported. ""I've said several times: Arizona is a good government state,"" Ducey said in a November 2020 interview, the Arizona Republic reported. ""I trust our election system. There's integrity in our election system. Joe Biden did win Arizona."" Since Ducey certified the election results, Trump has repeatedly lashed out at the Republican governor and pledged to oppose his candidacy in the GOP primary race if he runs against Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly in 2022. Read the original article on Business Insider",Politics/INSIDER,Steve Bannon claims Trump rally will prompt Arizona to decertify Biden's 2020 election victory.

1/16/2022,"(Reuters) - Japan's southern prefecture of Okinawa reported record daily numbers of COVID-19 cases on Saturday, fueled by the spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant. Okinawa, which hosts 70% of U.S. military facilities in Japan, said it recorded 1,829 new coronavirus cases on Saturday. The governor of the prefecture, Denny Tamaki, previously said he was ""furious"" about what he called inadequate infection controls at U.S. bases that allowed the variant to spread to the public. Japan has since stepped up coronavirus restrictions in three regions that host U.S. military facilities, which have also announced stricter infection controls. Though Japan halted the entry of almost all foreign travellers into the country last November, the U.S. military moves staff in and out of the country under a separate testing and quarantine regime. Public broadcaster NHK said the western prefecture of Osaka was likely to also see record daily cases on Saturday exceeding 3,000 cases.

1/16/2022,"Suntory Whisky Though the world's most expensive bottles of booze tend to sell at auction, airports have also been home to some major sales. In fact, you could argue that the current run of whisky madness really took off (pun unintended) in 2018 at the Dubai Airport when a pair of The Macallan 1926 Scotch bottles sold for $1.2 million. A similar bottle went on to become the first $1 million bottle of whisky, while another holds the current record for most expensive bottle, selling for just short of $2 million. In 2018, when The Macallan unveiled its then oldest-ever Scotch (they've since released older), the brand even suggested you could try to score one of these 600 bottles — which retailed for $65,000 — ""in exclusive airport retail stores."" So here we are: Another remarkably expensive bottle of whiskey and at another airport — and this time, it was purchased from a duty-free shop. I wonder if they put it in one of those clear bags? The Unifree Duty Free shop at the Istanbul Airport in Turkey announced they sold a bottle of The Yamazaki 55 Year Old for $559,200. In theory, it's actually not even a bad deal: A bottle from the same year (but a different bottling) sold at auction in 2020 for $795,000. Maybe the buyer saved all that money on duty? Frankly, I'm not quite sure how that works. Granted, the buyer — an unnamed Chinese shopper — didn't happen to be window shopping while strolling through the airport when they made the purchase. The bottle was on display, however, the duty-free shop invited interested parties to submit bids. Eight people put in offers, and the $559,200 bid won out. ""[This sale] provides further evidence that special products can help to achieve amazing results for airport retail and that Istanbul Airport is the perfect site to offer rarities like The Yamazaki 55 Year Old to a particularly discerning international clientele,"" Unifree Duty Free CEO Ali Senher said in the announcement and all but inspiring the next Ocean's Eleven film to be shot at the Istanbul Airport. As for the whiskey itself, Yamazaki 55 Year Old is the oldest single-malt whiskey in the history of the House of Suntory distillery, a blend that even includes components distilled under the supervision of the company's founder, Shinjiro Torii. The coveted spirit has had two releases: In 2020, 100 bottles were released via a lottery system in Japan, followed by another 100 bottles released in 2021 to the rest of the world, including some to Gebr. Heinemann, a company that owns and operates retail outlets in airports and is partnered with Unifree. ""We always strive to offer our traveling shoppers superior experiences and premium products,"" Ruediger Stelkens, director of purchasing for liquor, tobacco and confectionery at Gebr. Heinemann, stated. ""Whisky enthusiasts know they can rely on Heinemann and our joint venture partners as a flagship destination for the discovery of rarities like The Yamazaki 55 Year Old."" So, yeah, who knows… Next time you're at duty-free, maybe ask if there are any half-million dollars bottles of whiskey lying around? And when you buy it, let me know if they just put it in one of those clear bags.",Business/Food & Wine,"Someone Just Bought a $559,200 Bottle of Japanese Whiskey at an Airport Duty-Free Shop",https://news.yahoo.com/someone-just-bought-559-200-151148713.html
1/16/2022,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Loud blasts were heard in several cities in western Iran early on Sunday, according to local news agencies and postings on social media, but the nature of the blasts was not immediately known. After several similar incidents in recent months, authorities said that the Iranian military was holding unannounced air defence drills amid rising tensions with Israel and the United States. The governor of the town of Asadabad said a ""terrifying sound"" was heard, but its origin was not clear, the semi-official news agency Fars reported. ""Initially it was thought it was the sound of thunderstorms due to the weather conditions, but this possibility was ruled out,"" the official said. ""The intensity of the sound in some places was such that doors and windows of houses shook and people left their houses,"" the Rokna news website said on its Telegram channel. A video posted on Twitter showed blasts that appeared to come from an anti-aircraft gun. Reuters was not immediately able to verify the footage. Tensions between Iran and arch-foe Israel have been on the rise, while Tehran has been holding indirect talks with Washington on salvaging the 2015 Iran nuclear deal with world powers. Israeli leaders have long threatened military action against Iran if they deem diplomacy a dead end for denying Tehran nuclear weaponry. The Islamic Republic says its nuclear ambitions are peaceful.
