1/1/2022,"A billionaire hedge fund founder who has given nearly £1.5m to the Conservatives has been knighted in the new year honours list, prompting accusations that Boris Johnson has “the wrong priorities”. David Winton Harding, who has been funding the Tories since 2006, was given the award for services to philanthropy.  The founder and chief executive of Winton Group is well known for supporting research and science projects, having given the largest single donation to the Science Museum, as well as multimillion pound donations to the University of Cambridge. A physics graduate from Cambridge, Harding pledged that some of the funds would be used to promote access for students from disadvantaged and minority ethnic backgrounds. A financial backer of the remain campaign during the EU referendum, Harding most recently gave £100,000 to the Tories in April and handed £300,000 to the party in the autumn before the 2019 election. Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, said: “During the pandemic the public has rightly come together to celebrate the real heroes from all those keeping our NHS going, our vaccine volunteers, key workers and all those who went above and beyond to keep our communities thriving. This [Harding’s knighthood] just shows that once again the Conservatives have the wrong priorities.” Anneliese Dodds, chair of the Labour party, said: “It seems the Conservatives are ringing in the new year in exactly the same way they’ve seen out the old: by rewarding their chums with gongs instead of our key worker heroes. “If you want Boris Johnson to recommend you for a knighthood, don’t bother working long hours on low wages to help others – just become a hedge fund manager and donate half a million pounds to the Tories.” Two longstanding Tory MPs – Bill Wiggin and Robert Goodwill – were also knighted for their “political service”. Wiggin has been an MP since 2001, largely as a backbencher, and previously served as a whip. He is now a member of the liaison committee that scrutinises the work of the prime minister. Goodwill has served as a minister in four departments. In previous years, the Tories have given many more honours to donors, aides and politicians, prompting cronyism rows. Harding and No 10 have been approached for comment. Harding has previously suggested he would back state funding of political parties. “I’ve given a bit of money to politics. I rather wish I didn’t have to,” he said in 2015. “I rather wish it was all funded some other way and that would remove the whole issue. “I’m sympathetic to the Tories and their approach to raising money but I’m also sympathetic to people who don’t like that in the UK. The Lib Dems said it should all be state funded and I’d be perfectly fine with state funding.”",News/UK news,Billionaire Tory donor knighted in new year honours list,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/31/billionaire-tory-donor-david-winton-harding-knighted-in-new-year-honours
1/1/2022,"Boris Johnson has named returning the crown stamps to pint glasses and scrapping a ban on selling goods in pounds and ounces on his list of the “key successes” of Brexit this year. The prime minister set out his views on the opportunities created by Brexit in 2021 a year after the signing of the UK-EU trade and cooperation agreement.  However, he made no mention of Northern Ireland in his new year’s message about Brexit, where there are still huge trade problems with the operation of the agreement and ongoing talks with the EU about how to proceed. The prime minister also omitted mention of the resignation of David Frost, the Tory peer overseeing Brexit. Frost is leaving the government after frustrations over Brexit negotiations and broader concerns over the government’s Covid policies and tax increases. His brief will be taken over by Liz Truss, the foreign secretary. In his anniversary message, Johnson said the UK had “used Brexit freedoms” to create a new immigration system and to strike new trade deals around the world with countries such as Australia. Johnson also claimed Brexit had helped secure the vaccine rollout, although some have challenged that claim. On cutting red tape, the prime minister listed ending VAT on sanitary products, simplifying complex EU alcohol duty rates, and forging ahead to remove the ban on selling in pounds and ounces as well as restoring the crown stamp on to the side of pint glasses as successes during the year. “We’ve replaced free movement with a points-based immigration system. We’ve secured the fastest vaccine rollout anywhere in Europe last year by avoiding sluggish EU processes. And from Singapore to Switzerland, we’ve negotiated ambitious free trade deals to boost jobs and investment here at home,” he said. “But that’s not all. From simplifying the EU’s mind-bogglingly complex beer and wine duties to proudly restoring the crown stamp on to the side of pint glasses, we’re cutting back on EU red tape and bureaucracy and restoring common sense to our rulebook.” Looking ahead to 2022, Johnson pledged the government would go “further and faster” to maximise the opportunities of Brexit. He said officials were reviewing thousands of individual EU regulations automatically kept on the statute book after Brexit with a view to repealing those that do not act in the best interests of people and businesses. Johnson also highlighted reviews of the regulatory regimes around artificial intelligence, self-driving vehicles, data rights, genetically modified food and medical devices as areas where the UK could deviate from the EU. “The job isn’t finished and we must keep up the momentum. In the year ahead my government will go further and faster to deliver on the promise of Brexit and take advantage of the enormous potential that our new freedoms bring,” he said. Truss held talks with her EU counterpart, Maroš Šefčovič, in the week before Christmas amid renewed calls to rip up the controversial Northern Ireland protocol. The cabinet minister, who is also the foreign secretary, said she wanted to negotiate “a comprehensive solution” to the agreement, which requires post-Brexit checks on goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain.",News/Politics,Johnson lists returning crowns to pint glasses as a key Brexit success,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/31/boris-johnson-crowns-pint-glasses-key-brexit-success
1/1/2022,"Having been there, done that, just fallen short and finally succeeded, Jürgen Klopp knows exactly what it takes to compete with Manchester City for the title and there was no mincing of words by the German as he outlined the task facing Liverpool in their latest battle with Pep Guardiola’s men. “You have to be perfect,” he said. “And if you’re not perfect you have to hope City are not perfect.” Both parts of that statement could be deemed wishful thinking at the end of a week in which the gap between the sides stretched to nine points on the back of Liverpool suffering a shock 1-0 defeat to Leicester and City winning by the same scoreline at Brentford to make it 10 league victories in a row for the champions and leaders. They are looking relentless again, whereas for Liverpool there is the very real threat of a stumble becoming a full-on fall given their next assignment is Sunday’s trip to Chelsea. It will not be easy against the team one place and point ahead of them and defeat, coupled with City winning again at Arsenal on Saturday, really would make Liverpool’s title hopes feel terminal.  Some may deem that a case of bleak exaggeration clashing with the fresh hope of a new year but the truth is that, under Guardiola, City have become a side who do not panic and pull up when they have their noses out in front, and in the process of winning three out of the previous four titles have racked up a huge amount of points, most notably a league-record 100 in 2017-18. Liverpool could not outdo them the following season even after reaching 97 points and had to go to 99 points in 2019-20 to finally take their crown. It is hard work and with City on course to break the 90-point barrier again, little wonder Klopp feels perfection is needed to prevail. “The problem is not the motivation, the problem is the quality of City,” he said. “We had a couple of years where we really could catch up with them and be close but they are able to do ridiculous things, like win their last 15 [games] or whatever. That is the situation, but we want to have that competition; it’s fine, City are there to be beaten, and during a season, usually, each team has a problematic phase. The shorter that phase is, the better it is, and the more likely it gives you the chance to win something. And we will really give it [winning the title] a go.” Liverpool’s commitment under Klopp has never been in question and it should be noted that the loss to Leicester was only their second of the season, the same as City have suffered. It is frustrating draws, such as against Brentford and Brighton, that are truly hurting the Reds and if they can cut those out then there is no reason why a team brimming with quality, experience and nous cannot remain in the title mix. For that to be the case, they really could do with beating Chelsea and will feel that is a realistic proposition given their opponents’ lack of form with one win in their past league four games, lack of resources due to injuries and a Covid outbreak, and internal strife caused by Romelu Lukaku’s interview to Sky Italia in which the £97.5m striker declared he was “not happy” at the club. “We don’t like it,” Thomas Tuchel said in response. “It brings noise that we don’t need.” Liverpool should smell blood, but it hardly helps that they have selection problems of their own with Thiago Alcântara among a host of players out injured – according to Klopp, the Spain midfielder has a “hip issue which we have no idea where it’s coming from” – and three fresh Covid cases confirmed within the squad, all currently unnamed. As things stand, Liverpool have not asked for Sunday’s game to be postponed but, speaking on Friday, Klopp did not rule that out. “We never had this proper outbreak where 15 to 20 players had it [Covid],” he said. “For us it is every day, another one, stuff happens more and more often. It’s like a lottery waiting for the results. “We deal with difficulties like this every day, which is challenging. But in the end, when the lineup is out there, when the meeting is finished, the boys are ready to go. And we try again.” City have been warned.",Sport/Football,"Liverpool ‘have to be perfect’ to keep Manchester City in sight, admits Klopp",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/31/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-have-to-be-perfect-chelsea-manchester-city
1/1/2022,"Leading figures of science and medicine during the coronavirus pandemic have been feted in the Queen’s new year honours list, including the chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, who is to receive a knighthood for his role in battling Covid-19.  The CMOs for Scotland and Wales, Dr Gregor Smith and Dr Frank Atherton, are also to be given knighthoods, as is the deputy medical officer for England, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, and the head of the UK Health Security Agency, Dr Jenny Harries, who becomes a dame. The UK chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, is elevated to the Order of the Bath. The teenage tennis star Emma Raducanu – praised for her “remarkable achievement at such a young age” by the Queen after her remarkable US Open win – is to be awarded an MBE, after also being crowned the BBC’s Sports Personality of the Year. After a successful Tokyo Olympic Games – in which Team GB equalled its London 2012 medal haul to come fourth in the table and excelled in new sports including BMX, skateboarding, and weightlifting – 78 Olympians and Paralympians are celebrated for services to sport this year. Among them are the married Olympians Laura and Jason Kenny who have received a damehood and knighthood for services to cycling – believed to be the first time a married couple has been recognised on the same list at the same time. Jason Kenny became Britain’s most decorated Olympian after winning gold in the men’s keirin at Tokyo 2020, while Laura Kenny became the first British woman to win gold at three Olympics. The wheelchair sprinter Hannah Cockroft, who took her Paralympic gold medal tally to six this summer after a decade at the top of her sport, receives an OBE. The swimmer Adam Peaty and the diver Tom Daley receive OBEs not only for coming home with gold medals but also for raising awareness of mental health and LGBT issues, while the sailor Hannah Mills gets an OBE for her prowess on the water and continued campaigning on marine pollution. Other Olympians and Paralympians recognised include the cyclist Jody Cundy, who gets a CBE, and the sprinter and cyclist Kadeena Cox, who receives an OBE. There are MBEs for the diver Matty Lee, the BMX racer Bethany Shriever and the boxer Lauren Price, who said she was “gobsmacked” to receive the award. Price, a champion footballer turned kickboxer turned boxer, dedicated the honour to her grandparents, with whom she has lived since she was a baby. “My gran and grandad have always supported me and encouraged me. If it wasn’t for them then I wouldn’t have achieved what I have today,” she said. The actors Joanna Lumley and Vanessa Redgrave become dames for their services to drama, entertainment and charity, while John Boorman, the director of Hollywood films including Excalibur, Point Blank and Deliverance, is also knighted. In a move that may raise eyebrows in Whitehall circles, the actor Daniel Craig receives the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George (CMG) for outstanding contribution to film. It is the same award given to the fictional character he is best-known for playing, and one normally reserved for professional diplomats and intelligence officers. The veteran soap stars June Brown and William Roache receive OBEs, and the actor Cherylee Houston gets an MBE for services to drama and to people with disabilities. The Loose Women star and activist Katie Piper, who sustained life-changing burns in an acid attack in March 2008, receives an OBE for her services to charity and victims of burns and other disfigurement injuries. Elsewhere in the cultural sphere, Alistair Spalding, the artistic director of Sadler’s Wells, is awarded a knighthood for services to dance, saying the award is an indication “that our vibrant dance culture goes from strength to strength”. John Gilhooly, the artistic director of Wigmore Hall, is honoured with a CBE for services to music, while the songwriter Bernie Taupin, best known for his long-term partnership with Sir Elton John, is awarded a CBE. Melanie Brown of the Spice Girls has been made an MBE for her work with the domestic violence charity Women’s Aid. In the art world, Peter Murray, who founded Yorkshire Sculpture Park in 1977, is knighted while the large-scale installation artist Es Devlin, the first woman to design the UK Pavilion for Expo since its inception in 1851, is awarded a CBE. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, paid tribute to the 1,122 individuals celebrated – 361 at BEM, 508 at MBE and 253 at OBE – thanking them for their contribution to the nation. “These recipients have inspired and entertained us and given so much to their communities in the UK or in many cases around the world,” he said. “The honours are an opportunity for us to thank them, as a country, for their dedication and outstanding contribution.” The former prime minister Tony Blair is appointed a Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, the oldest and most senior order of chivalry. Trevor Phillips, the former chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, has been knighted for services to equality and human rights. Frank Field, the MP for Birkenhead from 1979 to 2019 who now sits in the House of Lords, is made a companion of honour – where membership is limited to 65 people – along with Nobel Prize-winning geneticist Sir Paul Nurse. In business, knighthoods go to Nigel Wilson, the chief executive of Legal & General, and Ian Livingstone, the co-founder of Games Workshop. The veteran broadcaster Moira Stuart, who was the first African-Caribbean woman to read the news on British television, is recognised for her services to media. She said “it hasn’t been easy” but she was “moved and lifted” to be made a CBE. The continued fight against coronavirus once again featured heavily in this year’s honours list, with vaccine chief Dr Emily Lawson made a dame for her work on the rollout programme, while June Raine – whom the committee said as head of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency had ensured that laboratories stayed open and carried out viral work through the pandemic – also becomes a dame. After a summer in which the men’s England football team reached a Euros final for the first time – only for key players to be subjected to racist abuse – the list honours the work of Gary Bennett, a former Sunderland footballer and one of the first three patrons of the charity Show Racism the Red Card. “I’ve been overwhelmed and thankful for it, proud and honoured,” said Bennett. But he added that 30 years after he experienced racist abuse as the first black captain of Sunderland, it was time that social media companies faced sanctions for allowing similar racist abuse on their platforms. “Social media [firms] need to be accountable and some form of punishment needs to be put out there,” he said. In the 2022 new year honours list, women represent 47.9% of the total honours (dropping to 35.9% of recipients at CBE level and above); 25.5% are from a lower socio-economic background; 15.1% come from a BAME background; 13.3% have a disability; and 3.5% identify as being LGBT. Of those honoured, 799 (63%) have worked in their communities, including the youngest people ever to be included in the list: 11-year-old Tobias Weller and 12-year-old Max Woosey, who are recognised for their fundraising efforts during the pandemic. The oldest person on the list is 102-year-old Henry Lewis, the honorary vice-president of the magicians’ society The Magic Circle, who is given an MBE for services to fundraising and charitable causes.",News/UK news,New year honours feature Covid experts with Chris Whitty knighted ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/31/chris-whitty-knighted-as-covid-experts-feted-in-new-year-honours-list
1/1/2022,"Young people who have acted as tutors, community leaders and fundraisers are among those honoured in the Queen’s new year honours list. The youngest recipients – and the youngest people ever to receive an honour – are 11 and 12. Max Woosey, 12, has captured the imagination of outdoors-loving young people by camping out for what is now 21 consecutive months to raise nearly £600,000 and counting for the North Devon Hospice, which cared for his neighbour Rick Abbott who died of cancer aged 74 in March 2020.  Max, who inspired thousands of children around the world to camp in their own back yards, said receiving the honour felt “unreal”. “Getting an award like this for not being famous but for doing good things I think shows that we do have a good future, that young people can be role models, and it is all going to be all right,” he said. Yet Max is not the youngest on the list, an accolade that goes to 11-year-old Tobias Garbutt Weller, from Sheffield. Inspired by Captain Sir Tom Moore, Tobias has completed two marathons and an Ironman challenge despite being unable to walk unaided. Starting when he was nine years old in March 2020, Tobias, who is autistic and has cerebral palsy, has raised more than £150,000, and he is awarded the British Empire Medal (BEM). As well as feats of endurance, young people are also recognised for stepping up to help their communities, such as 16-year-old Sahil Usman who delivered essential items to vulnerable people in Blackburn while undergoing treatment for leukaemia. As well as raising awareness about the impact of cancer on young people in presentations in schools, Sahil has hosted a radio show for local minority ethnic communities to encourage understanding of coronavirus. In Luton, Muhammad Kamil Ali turned himself into a tutoring machine during the pandemic. The 19-year-old, who is applying for medical school, taught every day for periods through the BCPD Trust, and still regularly teaches young people whose education was disrupted as a result of Covid out of school hours. “It’s a good feeling,” he said, on being awarded a BEM. “I’ve been doing it a long time now so it feels nice to have that recognised.” Asked what the awards to young people said about the UK, he added: “I think it shows that everybody has a skill, everyone is good at something. In life you should give back, and everyone can find their own way of doing that.” Alice Jackson, 21, from Andover in Hampshire, said her BEM – awarded after she became a leading member of a group of volunteers helping their rural community in lockdown – was a reflection of a bigger group effort. “[The award] is a reflection on the whole community coming together and looking out for other people,” she said. “At the time it just had to be done – I just thought it was an issue that needed solving and I had the time to do it.” A Cabinet Office spokesperson said the 2022 list was one of the most diverse on record, and included a greater number of awards for young people. They said: “Young people have done some extraordinary things during the pandemic and it’s important that the country recognises that service.”",News/UK news,Inspirational young people recognised in new year honours list,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/31/inspirational-young-people-recognised-in-new-year-honours-list
