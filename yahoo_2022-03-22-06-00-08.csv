With people working from home and less likely to leave their sofas, the World Health Organization increased its recommended range of exercise for adults. The new guidelines suggest 150–300 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity and 75–150 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity per week. While moderately intense workouts can include going for a walk or a virtual yoga class, you may want some at-home equipment to help you kick it up to a more “vigorous” level. Take a rowing machine, for example. Over 9,000 Amazon shoppers give this best-selling rowing machine by Sunny Health & Fitness 5 out of 5 stars. And, it only costs about $106. (Psst! That’s less than most running sneakers.) Buy Now Rowing works the entire body, as the machine mimics the movement you’d make if you were rowing a boat. And while you can use it for low or high impact exercises, it’s easier on the joints than say, running. “The rowing machine is like the Swiss Army knife of the gym,” professional rower and Hydrow athlete Michelle Sosa told Shape Magazine. “Its multiple purposes include low-impact workouts, high-intensity sprint intervals, low-intensity endurance development, full-body strength training, core training, heart health, and posture control.” The Sunny Health & Fitness Rower has 12 levels of smooth resistance that’s also quiet, thanks to a hydraulic resistance system, according to the product description. It uses a digital monitor to track your workout time, row count and calories. The ergonomically-designed seat is cushioned, the handlebars are padded with foam and the foot pedals have a non-slip grip, making the machine comfortable to use as well. One Amazon reviewer, who mentioned they were initially reluctant to buy it based on the low-price, gave it a 5-star rating. They wrote, “Things I like the most about this item are: very cheap for the quality, the size (as we have very small apartment and it fits in a closet when not being used), 12 resistance settings, quick installation and lightweight yet durable and stable while you are working on it.” “This is the best workout machine I have used,” wrote another reviewer. “And it’s fun to work out on. I use it for 45 minutes every day! My clothes are fitting better, [and] OMG my arms are getting in shape.” This rowing machine is further proof that you don’t need to spend a lot of money or have a lot of space to get in a good workout at home. With this rowing machine, the gym’s got nothing on your living room. If you’re looking for more ways to workout from home, check out the best exercise bikes.

3/22/2022,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Dozens of well-known leaders in Jamaica including professors and politicians are demanding an apology and slavery reparations as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge prepare for a trip to the former British colony. The group is rejecting the visit of Prince William and Kate scheduled for Tuesday, part of a larger trip to the Caribbean region that coincides with the 60th anniversary of Jamaica’s independence and the 70th anniversary of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. “We see no reason to celebrate 70 years of the ascension of your grandmother to the British throne because her leadership, and that of her predecessors, have perpetuated the greatest human rights tragedy in the history of humankind,” read a letter published Sunday ahead of the couple’s visit and signed by 100 Jamaican leaders. The weeklong royal tour of Central America and the Caribbean that began on Saturday was taken at the behest of the queen, who is William’s grandmother. The trip aims to strengthen Britain’s ties with Commonwealth countries, but it’s off to a rocky start and comes as some countries consider cutting ties to the monarchy like the eastern Caribbean island of Barbados did in November. Local opposition forced the royal couple to cancel a visit to a cacao farm in Belize that was planned for Saturday, while the upcoming trip to Jamaica has angered some who say they are still waiting for an apology and slavery reparations. Jamaica lawmaker Mike Henry, who has long led an effort to obtain reparations that he estimates at more than 7 billion pounds, told The Associated Press in a phone interview that an apology is only the first step for what he described as “abuse of human life and labor.” “An apology really admits that there is some guilt,” he said. Hundreds of thousands of African slaves toiled in Jamaica under more than 300 years of British rule and faced brutal conditions. There were numerous bloody rebellions, with one woman called “Queen Nanny” leading a group of formerly enslaved Africans known as Jamaican Maroons whose guerrilla warfare became renown and battered British forces. “Queen Nanny” remains the sole female of Jamaica’s eight national heroes. During their two-day stay in Jamaica, Prince William and Kate are expected to celebrate Bob Marley’s legacy, a move that also has riled some Jamaicans. “As a Rastafarian, Bob Marley embodied advocacy and is recognized globally for the principles of human rights, equality, reparations and repatriation,” stated the letter of those demanding an apology. The group said that it would be celebrating 60 years of freedom from Britain, adding that it is saddened “that more progress has not been made given the burden of our colonial inheritance. We nonetheless celebrate the many achievements of great Jamaicans who rejected negative, colonial self-concepts and who self-confidently succeeded against tremendous odds. We will also remember and celebrate our freedom fighters.”",World/Associated Press,"Jamaicans shun UK royal visit, demand slavery reparations",https://news.yahoo.com/jamaicans-shun-uk-royal-visit-183949071.html
3/22/2022,"The U.S. has uncovered ""credible information"" that Russian forces ""are creating lists of identified Ukrainians to be killed or sent to camps,"" and that Russian troops will ""likely use lethal measures to disperse peaceful protests,"" according to a recent letter to a U.N. high commissioner, sent by a U.S. ambassador. The undated letter—published by The Washington Post on Sunday and written by Ambassador Bathsheba Nell Crocker, U.S. representative to the Office of the United Nations, and addressed to U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet—warns of a potential ""human rights catastrophe"" in the coming days. ""I would like to bring to your attention disturbing information recently obtained by the United States that indicates that human rights violations and abuses in the aftermath of a further invasion are being planned,"" Crocker wrote. ""These acts ... would likely target those who oppose Russian actions, including Russian and Belarusian dissidents in exile in Ukraine, journalists and anti-corruption activists, and vulnerable populations such as religious and ethnic minorities and LGBTQI+ persons. ""Specifically, we have credible information that indicates Russian forces are creating lists of identified Ukrainians to be killed or sent to campus following a military occupation. We also have credible information that Russian forces will likely use lethal measures to disperse peaceful protests or otherwise counter peaceful exercises of perceived resistance from civilian populations."" The letter does not offer additional details. On Sunday the Ukrainian city of Mariupol issued a statement claiming that its residents were being taken to Russia against their will, and a Ukrainian lawmaker said they were being forced into labor in remote areas of Russia, the Associated Press reported. “Over the past week, several thousand Mariupol residents have been taken to the Russian territory,” the city statement said, according to the AP, adding that Ukrainians' cellphones and documents were examined by Russian troops before moving them. Nearly 3,000 people have been taken from Mariupol to Russia since March 5, Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine said Sunday, the AP reported. Inna Sovsun told Times Radio that, according to the Mariupol mayor and city council, the citizens are going to so-called filtration campus, ""where they’re being forced to sign papers that they will stay in that area for two or three years and they will work for free in those areas,"" the AP added. A Thursday article in Foreign Policy reported that Russia has drafted ""lists of Ukrainian political figures and other prominent individuals to be targeted for either arrest or assassination in the event of a Russian assault on Ukraine,"" according to four individuals familiar with U.S. intelligence.

3/22/2022,"Watch: Fire rages after Boeing 737 jet 'crashes into mountainside' in China A Boeing 737 airliner with 132 people aboard has crashed into a mountainous area in southern China in what looks set to be the country’s most deadly plane crash for decades. The aircraft, on a flight from the city of Kunming to Guangzhou, slammed into a thick forest of bamboo on a hillside in Guanxi province. Thick smoke and huge flames could be seen rising on a video posted by the South China Morning Post but it was unclear whether the was already a fire in the area. Tracking data showed the aircraft cruising at 29,100 feet at 2.20 p.m. Some two minutes later it had dropped to just over 9,000 feet and 20 seconds after that to just 3,225 feet. FlightRadar said that indicated a vertical descent of 31,000 feet per minute—or around 350 mph. Another video circulating on social media, the authenticity of which The Daily Beast could not immediately verify, appeared to show the aircraft streaking into the ground in a nose-down vertical position. U.S. government-backed Radio Free Asia reported that the video was captured by CCTV at a mine. “Can confirm the plane has crashed,” China Eastern Airlines said in a statement announcing a special hotline for passengers’ relatives. Flight MU5735 left the southwestern city of Kunming at 1:11 p.m. and had been due to land at Guanzhou at 3:05 p.m. According to data from FlightRadar24, the six-year-old Boeing 737-800 was last tracked at 2:22 p.m. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said the aircraft, with 123 passengers and nine crew aboard, had lost contact over the city of Wuzhou. Earlier reports from Chinese state media had said there were 133 people on board. Chinese President Xi Jinping expressed his shock at the news and called for an “all-out effort” in the rescue operation. But according to a firefighting official quoted by the state-run People’s Daily newspaper, there was no sign of life among the debris. Watch: China passenger jet crashes Once known as a black spot for plane crashes, China has cleaned up its act in recent years, investing in a young modern fleet of aircraft and strict safety controls. China’s last fatal airliner accident is thought to have been in 2010, when an an Embraer E-190 jet flown by Henan Airlines crashed on approach to Yichun airport in low visibility. Forty-four of 96 people aboard were killed. Mainland China’s most deadly crash was in June 1994, when a Tupolev TU-154 broke up in mid-flight, killing all 160 people aboard. Boeing started making the 737-800, a narrow-bodied single-aisle commuter plane, in the mid-1990s and delivered 5,200 to airlines around the world before it was phased out two years ago. China Eastern has more than 100 of the planes, which it has now grounded while Monday's crash is investigated. Read more at The Daily Beast.
