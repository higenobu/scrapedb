3/6/2022,"Consumers will still be able to use Mastercard and Visa-branded cards for domestic purchases in Russia, the country’s state-backed payments network has said, reducing the impact of the US firms’ decision to pull services over the invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s homegrown payments system Mir said the cardholders would still be able to access their funds, make withdrawals and domestic transfers – at least until their bank cards expire. Mir has processed most domestic payments in Russia since 2015, while foreign operators such as Visa and Mastercard continued to run international transactions. The operator – which is 100% owned by the country’s central bank – was established on government orders to protect the economy against sanctions imposed over Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. “All cards of these payment systems already issued by Russian banks will continue to work within our country as before,” Mir’s operator said in the early hours of Sunday. “Until the expiration of their validity, Visa and Mastercard cardholders have access to all the funds on their accounts, as well as all the usual payment transactions - paying for purchases, transferring funds from card to card, withdrawing cash, etc.” The statement was issued shortly after the US firms declared on Saturday they would be suspending Russian operations in light of Moscow’s continued military assault on Ukraine. Both Mastercard and Visa’s decision to suspend their Russian operations will primarily impact foreign payments, meaning local consumers will no longer be able to use their Russian cards abroad or for international payments online. Foreign customers will also be blocked from making payments to Russian companies or withdrawing cash within the country. “Payments abroad, including on foreign internet resources, will not be available with Visa and Mastercard international payment systems cards issued by Russian banks,” Mir confirmed. The move is expected to accelerate Russian banks’ adoption of Mir’s own cards, which are accepted in a handful of countries including Turkey, Vietnam, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. On Saturday, Mir said it already had seen a surge in demand for its cards following sanctions being imposed against Russian banks by the US, EU and UK. According to its own statistics, more than half of Russians already owned a Mir card as of September 2021, accounting for 32% of all transactions. The uptake is likely to play into critics’ fears that economic sanctions will merely incentivise Russia to invest in alternative schemes. Similar concerns have been raised about blocking Russia from Swift – the secure message system used by banks for cross-border payments – and the potential rise of alternatives such as Russia’s equivalent SPFS system. PayPal stopped accepting new customers in Russia on Wednesday and on Saturday expanded that block, saying its services there – primarily, customers transferring money to each other – had been suspended. It added that it would allow withdrawals “for a period of time, ensuring that account balances are dispersed in line with applicable laws and regulations”.",News/Business,"Russians can still use Visa and Mastercard for domestic purchases, authorities say",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/06/russians-visa-mastercard-ban-domestic-purchases-mir

3/6/2022,"Why does music played in major chords and keys tend to be more uplifting, whereas minor chords are more poignant and sad? Is this an innate reaction? Or is it a learned, cultural reaction and therefore not universal to all human societies? Stella O’Shea Send new questions to nq@theguardian.com. I’m pretty sure that it isn’t learned behaviour. That would get obvious, wouldn’t it? We would be neutral about minor or major keys until at age 10 in music class the teacher tells us we should hear these chords as bright and sunny, and these other chords as sad and melancholy (if also a bit sweet in their sorrow). In that case the uneducated in music wouldn’t hear any difference. FranzPepper My younger son (now four) could certainly identify different moods to music such as happy, sad, angry by the time he was three. Granted he has only heard western music, but he has a clear preference for calm and uplifting music. He has a great ear for rhythm and a lovely tuneful singing voice; it’s really interesting how he can instinctively hear differences musically when my other older son can’t. gemsab It’s cultural, and you don’t have to travel to see that. In medieval times in Europe, when music was composed in numerous modes rather than just simple major or minor keys, what we now call minor was not associated with sadness. The equivalent of a minor key was lively and uplifting. merchycwm This is quite likely the ultimate notes and queries question, featuring as it does a query about notes. What could be more delightfully harmonious, symmetrical and uplifting? But I have a minor quibble, because the assumption behind the question can easily be overstated. For example, the relentlessly cheerful Christmas carol God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen is in a minor key. Furthermore, speaking from personal experience, I recall that in my youth my own memorably stately and emotionally fraught interpretation of an ostensibly simple C-sharp major scale (hands together, three octaves in thirds) once reduced a sensitive listener to uncontrollable sobbing. And she was my piano teacher. ThereisnoOwl While God Rest Ye Merry is certainly a lot closer to minor than major, the flattened seventh makes its modal rather than tonal. Minor tonality is a modified mode, but that tune is in a purer, unmodified form of it, characteristic of the earlier, pre-1600 system, with more than just the two modes. That unmodified minor is sometimes called Aeolian mode. I think it is fairer to say that major chordal centres and tunes tend to present more straightforward emotional worlds, which can be happy or sad, or other things, including bold and stirring or quiet and gentle, but always quite simple and direct. Minor ones I would think of as more complex, indirect and serious, rather than sad. You could perhaps hear God Rest Ye Merry as quite serious about its merrymaking, and Silent Night more of a simple and direct lullaby. PaniscusTroglodytes Intervals (two different notes played simultaneously) create vibrations that affect a neurological response in the listener. The most pleasing interval is the fifth (eg A to E, a fifth above), followed by a fourth (A to D), then a major third (A to C#), followed by a minor third (A to C). As the span of the intervals become smaller, the vibrations become move complex, the brain interprets the complexity as almost a dangerous event. The minor second (A to Bb) is the workhorse of film composers when they wish to underscore danger, threat, fear, etc. Prof David McHugh Lennie Bernstein (i was about eight, so forgive me) said we can hear the clash of harmonics caused by the flattened third in the minor chord, and that makes us uncomfortable. OneAnotherName What Bernstein was describing is the harmonic overtone series, which is a natural phenomenon. Resonating notes are made up of more sounds than just the main note you hear. The main note you hear is called the fundamental, and it sets off the series, which starts with the same note one octave up. The next interval is a major fifth, and the one after that is a major third. Those other vibrations happening above the main note give the sound character and richness. So when a fundamental is played, and then a minor third is harmonised separately on top of it, the ear is still sensing the major third caused by the overtone series – because that overtone is still vibrating. But they are also hearing that minor third, which is a semitone below it, and that is a somewhat disturbing sound. Not quite as comfortable as the “happier” sounding match between a major third harmony and its natural overtone … If you have a piano or keyboard handy, and you play any semitone interval – such as a B and a C together – you can hear that dissonance, a kind of “rubbing” sound. yonah That makes sense as far as intervals are concerned, but what if you add a fifth too? If you play a major triad, there’s a minor third interval within it. And similarly a major third within a minor triad. So they both contain the harmonic dissonance you refer to, albeit with a different relation to the fundamental. Perhaps it’s just confirmation bias, but I’m typing this comment at my piano and it does seem that a naked minor third sounds more starkly unsettling than the major third, whereas the difference between the major and minor triads is more subtle. Snowshovel It depends where you put the fifth. If the fifth is added above the major or minor third (ie the root position of a triad), that note’s overtone series won’t interfere with the notes or intervals below it … since the overtone series is only triggered upwards from the note itself. So, for example, if you’re playing a C major triad in root position, with the fifth on top, the C (which is the lowest fundamental) will not be generating an audible Eb overtone to interfere with the E natural. This is the reason why choices of inversions and chord voicings are so emotional. yonah There may be a contrast between the flattened third of a minor chord and some higher harmonics, but minor chords sound sad even when played with pure sine waves and not a harmonic in sight. Ubergeekian What about cultures such Indonesia where the gamelan uses a seven-tone scale? These days I guess everyone has been indoctrinated with the western 12-tone scale markymarkoldface I found a 2010 Guardian article (left) reporting on a study in the US that found that when actors were asked to convey sadness, their speech melodies naturally expressed a minor third – but which came first, the minor third in speech or music. The piece concluded that it was learned behaviour. It referenced a book by Ross Duffin, How Equal Temperament Ruined Harmony …, which quotes the 18th-century mathematician Robert Smith, who tended to agree that it was a result of the 12-tone scale. However, blues music also has a melancholic feel, and that’s believed to be based on “just intonation”, unlike European 12-tone equal temperament tuning. Other examples of just intonation include the 17-tone Arabic scale and the 22-tone Indian classical scale. African cultures, where blues is derived from, also use just intonation as a norm in music. MrsLessing There is lots of music which is not based on the western chromatic scale. The same harmonic overtone series exists – because it’s a physical phenomenon – but people who use other scales can comfortably hear more of the overtones, so intervals that might sound sadder, or even dissonant, to someone who listens only to 12-tone scale-based music doesn’t sound that way to them. Cajun and Zydeco music have a tonal system in which the leading melody, whether sung or played on a pitchable instrument – such as a fiddle – will be tended sharp. Not a full quarter-tone sharp, but somewhat sharp. And everybody does it the same way. Entire horn sections will sound this way. People who aren’t from that Louisiana culture will sometimes perceive it as “out of tune”, but it isn’t. There are more notes in the scale. A friend of mine who is a Cajun musician from Louisiana, when he tries to describe these notes to people unfamiliar with them, refers to them as “pitchillations”, and if they want to learn to play Cajun music, he tells them they’re going to have to get themselves a “pitichillator” in order to play it. yonah The major third and fifth feature strongly in the harmonic sequence and would have been the first harmonising notes used by our musical ancestors after octaves because they occur naturally as overtones and harmonics on string and wind instruments.Minor tonality became associated with more intense emotions during the late classical and romantic period. Prior to that, minor tonality was used often to indicate both happy and sad moods. Think madrigals such as Pastime With Good Company, a very jolly subject treated with strong minor tonality. Cod23 This may go some way to helping. LentilKnitter Unlike the other very educated and helpful commenters, I’m musically illiterate but even so I have a theory: could it be an evolutionary thing? Maybe scary dangerous things tend to sound minor or at least discordant, and safe, useful things are more usually in major keys? Say: thunderstorms, howling wolves, screaming winds, as opposed to birdsong, gently lapping waves, mooing cows and baa-ing sheep? Actually, I’m not even sure if cows don’t moo in a minor key. whenevernight I love music in the minor key. I don’t find it sad at all. Maybe it’s because I’m a melancholic Scot, or the influence of our traditional folk music, who knows, but anyway, minor keys are far more colourful! Kirstmacmur It’s cultural. Back in the 15th and 16th centuries, trumpets were used at funerals and so the Ionian mode (“major chord” sound) – trumpets could only play harmonics back then – was not associated with happiness. There are texts describe the Dorian mode, close to our minor scale, as the most suitable for joyful occasions and dances. dcammh“As so often in Schubert’s music, in the piano and chamber music without words as much as in the songs, the major key is even more heart-breaking than the minor”.

3/6/2022,"London Zoo at half-term is a cheerful cacophony with blue macaws out-screaming six-year-olds, but in the relative calm of the lush spider “walkthrough” exhibit (apologies, arachnophobes), Lucy Cooke is happily absorbed. “Let’s see if we can see a big predatory female,” she says. We can: a gorgeously colourful golden orb weaver sits in the centre of her vast gold-tinted web, 125 times bigger than her tiny mate. “I didn’t realise that the majority of spiders are sexual cannibals, that the big spiders in the middle of webs were always female; males are basically wandering useless sacks of sperm,” Cooke says loudly in earshot of several harried-looking human fathers. This is a very Lucy Cooke observation: uncensored, pithily expressed and startlingly informative. There is plenty more of that in her new book, Bitch: A Revolutionary Guide to Sex, Evolution & the Female Animal, a dazzling, funny and elegantly angry demolition of our preconceptions about female behaviour and sex in the animal kingdom (queendom?). For too long, Cooke argues, we have uncritically accepted a view of nature “through a Victorian pinhole camera” and worse, those misconceptions have been co-opted by ideologues “to claim that a host of grim male behaviours – from rape to compulsive skirt-chasing to male supremacy – were only natural for humans because Darwin said so.” That is simply, demonstrably wrong, as she outlines, combining colourful revelations with limpidly clear explanations of complex science. “Female animals,” she writes, “are just as promiscuous, competitive, aggressive, dominant and dynamic as males.” Bitch is a blast. I read it, my jaw sagging in astonishment, jotting down favourite parts to send to friends and reading out snippets gleefully to my male housemates for days. I don’t want to spoil it for you, but just a taster: spotted hyenas have eight-inch clitorises which get erections and female moles have “ovo-testes”, albatrosses can form lasting lesbian partnerships, all-female whiptail lizards reproduce asexually but engage in gender-fluid role play, and ducks have spiral-shaped vaginas, probably to evade forced copulation (40% of mallard sex is non-consensual; you’ll never look at your local duckpond in the same way, especially once you read the indelible phrase “The penis explodes out of his cloaca at 75mph, unfurling itself… like some kind of sinewy party hooter.”, which I screenshot and circulate widely) As for bonobos, if this were a podcast, I’d be issuing a content warning for later in the episode. Back to those mate-eating spiders. They are, if anything, one of the less surprising parts of the book; they fit that “female of the species more deadly than the male” cliché we carry along with all our other cultural baggage. “We have this fascination with the behaviour because it seems so campy and sexy and dangerous, and really, this cannibalistic behaviour is just an example of being assiduously maternal,” Cooke explains, as we search the edge of the web for a male. (“He’ll be looking a bit nervous, possibly bringing some kind of edible gift” – other male spiders use massage, “light bondage” and oral sex to try to stay alive.) “This is something male evolutionary biologists have really struggled with, but that’s because it’s considered from the male perspective; actually, it makes a lot of sense because it means the eggs get the best chance by being nourished as much as possible, including by the father that created them.” Leaving the spider house (“Look at that web!” she says on the way out. “World’s greatest engineer is bloody female!”), we encounter a gang of squirrel monkeys. This is another female-dominant species, Cooke tells me. “They look cute, but they’re a bunch of bad-ass bitches.” Finally, we try and fail to find the meerkats: Sergei and Aleksandr would not be calling the shots in this murderous matriarchy, and Oleg would probably have been eaten. “I wonder,” she muses, “what they do here to manage the infanticide situation.” I wanted to see Cooke among the animals because this is her element – well, as close as you can get without trudging through snow to find sage grouse in Yosemite, tracking lemurs through the Madagascar wilderness or scooping whale poo near Seattle, all of which she does in Bitch. She’s very much an adventurer, not just a thinker: her TV work (including Nature’s Boldest Thieves and Ingenious Animals for the BBC) and book research has taken her to 60 countries and remote biological field stations. She has just returned from Tanzania and Rwanda when we meet, where an encounter with mountain gorillas further fuelled a points she makes in Bitch: thatnurture is far from being a solely female characteristic. “They are this classic patriarchal species, males are these terrifying muscular creatures, but what I witnessed is them being incredibly tender with the babies.” After an outdoorsy childhood in a family of nature lovers, Cooke studied zoology at Oxford under Richard Dawkins. Afterwards, she says, “I wanted to be either an actor or David Attenborough.” Instead, she went into TV and documentary filmmaking, but quit in frustration when no one would let her make a film about the decline in amphibians (“For God’s sake, Lucy, can’t you come back with a story about an animal with a furry face?” one commissioner told her). Cooke spent six months travelling around South America, exploring the story under her own steam: “I was about to turn 40,” she says, “And I was having an unconventional midlife crisis.” In the South American jungle, writing her blog, the Amphibian Avenger, she says, “I’d landed in my happy place and everything made sense.” National Geographic offered her a TV series on the back of the blog and she has rarely been off-screen since, infectiously curious and endlessly delighted by the weirder, less obviously appealing species and behaviours. All of which makes Cooke the perfect person to tell these myth-busting female-centred stories. What, I ask, surprised her most during her research? It was the most fundamental stuff, she tells me: the genetics. “The fact that the genes that make an ovary or testes, the things that drive you down the male or female pathway, are basically the same genes, just playing a different tune. I couldn’t believe it. This idea of male and female being these distinct genetic entities is complete rubbish. As a species we’re fascinated by dichotomies, we want everything to be black and white, but it just doesn’t work like that. When it comes to sex, anything goes.” I find this section of the book both exhilarating and unexpected; Cooke describes it as a “paradigm shift”. “The Victorian era was all about imposing order on the natural world,” she says, “but now the approach is to embrace the chaos and to realise the infinite possibilities of developmental plasticity.” Bitch explores this variety and plasticity of sex in gripping detail: the complex and chaotic process of genetic sex determination, parthenogenesis (“virgin” births), gynandromorphy (“half and half” sexual characteristics in a single individual) and sex changes. A biologically accurate Finding Nemo, Cooke writes drily, “would have seen Nemo’s father, Marlin, transition into a female and then start having sex with his son, which might have made for a less popular family film”. The fact that so little of this science of what it means to be female is known reminds me of Caroline Criado-Perez’s Invisible Women. In animals, too, scientists not interested in the female experience failed to research it, creating a data gap that means we do not get the full picture. Cooke relates how often-female scientists have been fighting for decades to engineer the radical perspective shift that would allow us to see, and understand, the far more complex and less deterministic real story of sex and reproduction. In particular, Bitch is luminous with affection and admiration for a group of pioneering, now semi-retired professors – “The Broads”, Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, Jeanne Altmann, Mary Jane West-Eberhard and Patricia Gowaty – whose formidable research challenged the Darwinian phallocracy. “If this book makes their work and their names better known, then that’s a great thing,” says Cooke, praising their support and collegiality when she joined them for their annual get-together (“It’s like meeting four Richard Dawkins in one go!”) There’s a special mention, too, for Patricia Brennan, a trailblazing researcher of vaginal anatomy. “She was sitting on a table literally piled up with a rainbow of animal dildos on her desk and she sat back in her chair and said ‘So many vaginas, so little time’,” Cooke tells me, wonderingly, of her visit to Brennan’s Massachusetts lab. For all their efforts, and those of the “brilliant young scientists” Cooke also met in her research, the battle against this male-oriented bias continues: “The struggle is real and it’s happening now,” she says. As late as the 1990s, researchers were dismissing hierarchical fighting between female jays as “the avian equivalent of PMS” and Bateman’s Principle, a discredited demonstration of the reproductive advantage of promiscuity for male fruit flies, still appears unchallenged in textbooks, she says. TV, too, Cooke thinks, still needs to do better. “I ended up screaming at the television,” she says of The Mating Game, a recent BBC documentary on animal reproduction. “This idea that females are completely passive and it’s the males that have all the strategy just gets trotted out again and again. God, can we change the record? How about the strategy of motherhood? That’s as big, if not a bigger drama.” She knows, from her own TV experiences, the appeal of familiar stories – “There’s something cosy about them” – but perpetuating the stereotype of nurturing mother and providing father is simply inaccurate. “The majority of the animal kingdom is not like that: Dad’s eating the babies, Mum’s shagging the neighbours.” The book is a stinging corrective to anyone seeking to derive ideological comfort or support from conventional portrayals of animal behaviour. “We have this hangover from the [medieval] bestiaries,” Cooke says. “We look to the animal kingdom for moral guidance, we want them to fit these stereotypes, but they don’t.” She’s scornful of evolutionary psychologists making money trotting out the “Darwinian” theory that males are competitive and aggressive, females are coy and monogamous. “It’s complete bullshit. Using animals as ideological weapons is a dangerous game. You can find whatever you want in the animal kingdom. You could say look at the hamadryas baboon where the males kidnap the females while they’re still adolescent, then use systematic bullying in their harem to keep them oppressed, that’s a model for human behaviour, or you could look at the bonobos and say these females have overthrown the patriarchy through ecstatic same-sex frottage!” Ah yes, bonobos: these peaceable primates use sex toys, practise oral sex and establish and maintain female-led social structures through “genito-genital rubbing”. That’s entertaining, but it also matters: as Cooke says, it challenges the clichéd narrative on sex roles in primates, our closest animal relatives. When she isn’t finding new stories to tell, Cooke lives in Hastings with her rescue “jug” (Jack Russell-pug) Kobi; she never wanted children. Like many women, she doesn’t fit the stereotype of female behaviour and says she “felt weird” about that. It was one of the motivating factors in writing Bitch. “My acknowledged cultural bias – I’m writing about cultural bias, but I’m as biased as anybody – is that I wanted to showcase the diversity that exists, so that women would stop feeling pigeonholed; feeling they should be something they’re not. ‘I like sex’, ‘I’ve got a big clit’, ‘I only want to have sex with women’, ‘I’m bad at breastfeeding’… baboon first-time mums struggle with breastfeeding! If like me you haven’t seen your reflection in the animal kingdom, maybe you might see it and think, ‘Oh, I’m not a freak, it’s OK for me to be me. It’s all fucking natural.’” An extract from Bitch by Lucy Cooke Studying zoology made me feel like a sad misfit. Not because I loved spiders, enjoyed cutting up dead things I’d found by the side of the road or would gladly root around in animal faeces for clues as to what their owner had eaten. All my fellow students shared the same curious kinks, so there was no shame there. No, the source of my disquiet was my sex. Being female meant just one thing: I was a loser. “The female is exploited, and the fundamental evolutionary basis for the exploitation is the fact that eggs are larger than sperms,” wrote my college tutor Richard Dawkins in his bestselling evolutionary bible, The Selfish Gene. According to zoological law, we egg-makers had been betrayed by our bulky gametes. By investing our genetic legacy in a few nutrient-rich ova, rather than millions of mobile sperm, our forebears had pulled the short straw in the primeval lottery of life. Now we were doomed to play second fiddle to the sperm-shooters for all eternity; a feminine footnote to the macho main event. I was taught that this apparently trivial disparity in our sex cells laid cast-iron biological foundations for sexual inequality. “It is possible to interpret all other differences between the sexes as stemming from this one basic difference,” Dawkins told us. “Female exploitation begins here.” Male animals led swashbuckling lives of thrusting agency. They fought one another over leadership or possession of females. They shagged around indiscriminately, propelled by a biological imperative to spread their seed far and wide. And they were socially dominant; where males led, females meekly followed. A female’s role was as selfless mother, naturally; as such, maternal efforts were deemed all alike: we had zero competitive edge. Sex was a duty rather than a drive. And as far as evolution was concerned it was males who drove the bus of change. We females could hop on for a ride thanks to shared DNA, as long as we promised to keep nice and quiet. As an egg-making student of evolution, I couldn’t see my reflection in this 50s sitcom of sex roles. Was I some kind of female aberration? The answer, thankfully, is no. A sexist mythology has been baked into biology, and it distorts the way we perceive female animals. In the natural world female form and role varies wildly to encompass a fascinating spectrum of anatomies and behaviours. Yes, the doting mother is among them, but so is the jacana bird that abandons her eggs and leaves them to a harem of cuckolded males to raise. Females can be faithful, but only 7% of species are sexually monogamous, which leaves a lot of philandering females seeking sex with multiple partners. Not all animal societies are dominated by males by any means; alpha females have evolved across a variety of classes and their authority ranges from benevolent (bonobos) to brutal (bees). Females can compete with each other as viciously as males: topi antelope engage in fierce battles with huge horns for access to the best males, and meerkat matriarchs are the most murderous mammals on the planet, killing their competitors’ babies and suppressing their reproduction. Then there are the femme fatales: cannibalistic female spiders that consume their lovers as post- or even pre-coital snacks and “lesbian” lizards that have lost the need for males altogether and reproduce solely by cloning. In the last few decades there has been a revolution in our understanding of what it means to be female, thanks to a new generation of scientists who are helping to redefine not just the female of the species, but the very forces that shape evolution. Darwin’s theory of sexual selection drove a wedge between the sexes by focusing on our differences; but these differences are greater culturally than they are biologically. Animal characteristics – be they physical or behavioural – are both varied and plastic. They can bend according to a selection’s whim, which makes sex traits fluid and malleable. Rather than predicting a female’s qualities through the crystal ball of her sex, the environment, time and chance all play a significant role in shaping their form. Females and males are, in fact, far more alike than they are different. So much so, it can sometimes be hard knowing where to draw the line.

3/6/2022,"This Tuesday is International Women’s Day, when we celebrate women’s achievements and the victories women have won in the fight for equality. From the Equal Pay Act to the Sex Discrimination Act and the Equality Act through to the minimum wage and Sure Start, the Labour party has always stood up for women and driven the change they needed, while the Conservatives defended the status quo. As Labour’s shadow chancellor of the exchequer, I know I stand on the shoulders of giants from our party’s past: the Labour women who stood up and changed our country for the better. Women like Barbara Castle, who introduced the Equal Pay Act; Jennie Lee, who created the Open University; Alice Bacon, who reformed the law to make abortions legal; Ellen Wilkinson, who raised the school-leaving age; Jo Richardson’s campaigning against domestic violence, and the work done on Sure Start and tax credits by Tessa Jowell and Harriet Harman, have all shaped our movement and our country. Thanks to the radical improvements those Labour governments brought in to support women in their work and family lives, there are more women in work today than ever before, and more are balancing a career and a family, too. This week we celebrate that progress, while acknowledging that there is still much to do before women and men are equal. In that context, there can be no shying away from the fact that women were disproportionately affected by the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Even before the pandemic hit, women were more likely to be stuck in low-paid work and hampered by a parenthood pay gap. At its height, they were more likely to be furloughed, more likely to lose income, and more likely to work in the sectors that were hardest hit. Black, Asian and minority ethnic women – who are more likely to be in lower paid, insecure work in the first place – were hit particularly hard. Working from home also increased family duties for women, with mothers more likely to be interrupted and finding themselves with less time than fathers for their paid job. And of course, women are still paid less than men – a gender pay gap that has actually widened over the last year. The burden that women carried during the Covid crisis should be a wake-up call for the Conservative government. For too long, ministers have been complacent about the vital role that women can play in the economy. Labour wants to do things differently, with an approach based on bringing people together in a national endeavour, and on understanding that Britain’s real wealth is found in the effort and talent of tens of millions of working women. Labour believes that women hold the key to a strong economy – and the evidence backs that up. Women-led small- and medium-sized enterprises contribute about £85bn to the economy. And when women are involved in businesses – whether starting up, rising up or sitting on boards– they make them more profitable. Companies with the most gender-diverse executive teams are 25% more likely to have above-average profitability than those with the least diverse teams, and companies where more than three in 10 of their executives are women are more likely to outperform companies than those with fewer female executives. The government’s own study of UK FTSE 100 firms found a positive relationship between gender diversity and firm performance, which became more significant when three or more women were appointed to the board. This is all very encouraging, but it’s not clear if ministers have got the message. The government must recognise the role women will play in our economic recovery and understand the need to back them to succeed. Yet its own Small Business Survey shows that only 16% of small business employers and one in three of entrepreneurs are women, and women also struggle to access the financing and new business loans needed to get their companies off the ground. In bank financing, 15% of applications were led by women and 56% by men, and just 22% of new primary business bank accounts were opened by women, compared with 66% by men. Though success rates for both were roughly the same, the average loan amount approved for female-led businesses was around £25,000; for male-led businesses it was about £33,000. Labour wants to put women at the heart of our economic recovery – to lift women up, not hold them back. We will do that by backing female entrepreneurs and great British enterprise. Under the Conservatives, the rate of business creation has plummeted across every English region since 2016. Labour would reverse that trend by creating 100,000 new startups in the first term of a Labour government across all English regions – doubling the number of businesses the government’s Start Up Loans scheme is delivering through a five-year funding guarantee that will fund 20,000 new businesses a year over the next five years. Our Equal Recovery Pledge will also ensure that the inequality supercharged by the Covid pandemic does not become even deeper and more embedded during our recovery. The next Labour government will introduce a new deal for working people that will bring in stronger family-friendly rights. On International Women’s Day, it’s right that we celebrate women and the progress they have made in building a more equal society. But we cannot be complacent about the challenges they still face today. Labour understands that women are crucial to the future of Britain’s economy – and, as the first woman chancellor under a Labour government, I am determined to make sure their effort and talent is recognised.
