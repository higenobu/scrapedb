3/28/2022,"Scotland’s police force and its prosecution authority have refused to give 12 police officers immunity from criminal charges in an inquiry into the death in custody of Sheku Bayoh. Police Scotland’s deputy chief constable, Fiona Taylor, has told the judge chairing a public inquiry into Bayoh’s death in Kirkcaldy in May 2015 that officers are under a legal and professional duty to tell the truth, regardless of the risks of self-incrimination. Lord Bracadale, the inquiry chair, had urged Police Scotland and the Crown Office to provide undertakings officers would not be prosecuted for any evidence they gave his inquiry, to ensure they gave “full, frank and uninhibited” testimony. The officers involved, some of whom have since left the police, have consistently denied any wrongdoing and have not been prosecuted or disciplined over any aspect of Bayoh’s arrest. In a letter to Bracadale released on Monday, Taylor said it would undermine public confidence and threaten the force’s commitment to root out racist or discriminatory views if any such undertaking were given. “[Giving] full and frank testimony is the basic expectation we have of one another as police officers and the very least the public demands of us as their servants,” she said. “It is not transactional and should never be conditional. “The chief constable has made it clear that racism or discrimination of any kind is deplorable and completely unacceptable; it should have no place in society and it has no place in policing.” Ruth Charteris QC, the solicitor general, also rejected Bracadale’s request. “Prosecutors must consider all cases on their individual facts and circumstances and act in the public interest,” Charteris told Bracadale. “I have considered all the information available to me, and I am not currently satisfied that it is in the public interest to grant the undertakings.” Charteris added that the Crown Office might consider immunity in a specific instance if there was a clear risk that failing to do so would prevent Bracadale from fulfilling the inquiry’s terms of reference. But she added: “The crown has reserved its right to prosecute in all matters related to this case.” Due to start in May, the public inquiry was set up by the then Scottish justice secretary, Humza Yousaf, in 2019 after intense public pressure and an outcry from Bayoh’s family over the Crown Office’s decision not to prosecute the officers involved or Police Scotland. Bayoh, who was married and had two sons, died after being challenged by several police officers responding to allegations a black man had been seen in an agitated state carrying a bladed weapon. He was hit with batons, CS spray and pepper spray, and restrained on the pavement with wrist and leg ties. No bladed weapon was found and there were accusations Bayoh had taken drugs that morning, which could have contributed to his death. The inquiry’s terms of reference include an instruction to establish the cause of death and whether it was avoidable; whether police restraint training was at fault; whether the police’s actions “were affected by his actual or perceived race”; and events in the aftermath of his death, including securing evidence. The Scottish Police Federation, which represents many of the officers giving evidence, has been asked for a response.",News/UK news,Sheku Bayoh: officers refused immunity for inquiry into death in custody,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/28/sheku-bayoh-officers-refused-immunity-for-inquiry-into-death-in-custody
3/28/2022,"John Craven, presenter My involvement in Newsround came through two lucky breaks. In 1971, I was a reporter on BBC Points West in Bristol. One afternoon, I strolled into the studio and was told auditions were under way for Search, a new current affairs programme aimed at children. “Can I have a go?” I asked and, with less than five minutes to prepare, amazingly got the job. A year later, Edward Barnes, then deputy head of BBC Children’s TV, had a six-minute gap to fill on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 5pm. Much to the disquiet of some of his colleagues, he decided to fill it with news for children. Barnes persuaded Derrick Amoore, the BBC News editor, to give him all the facilities he needed free of charge and hand over complete editorial control – something that would never happen today. Jonathan Dimbleby was originally asked to front it, but he had just jumped ship to ITV. So my second lucky break came when I was invited to step in – and Newsround was born. Newsround’s task was to explain serious events in a simple way, keeping our audience posted on all the interesting, exciting things happening worldwide. We called it Newsround because lots of children had newspaper rounds. My name was added to make it seem more personal. I dressed casually which – as a suitless BBC newsreader – raised some eyebrows. I didn’t sit behind a desk because we didn’t want to make it seem like a classroom. BBC correspondents such as Martin Bell, John Humphrys and Michael Buerk sent in special reports. We also recruited our own reporters, starting with wonderful Lucy Mathen. We wanted Newsround to have authority and the format still holds 50 years on. Although I left Newsround after 17 years, and have been on Countryfile for nearly twice as along, I still feel enormously proud of my baby. Newsround’s success proves that children are interested in the world around them, especially if it’s explained in ways they can grasp. This is even more important now, when there is so much dangerously false information on social media. Middle-aged people still stop me in the street and say: “Thank you for being a voice of my childhood and getting me interested in the news.” Newsround is still fulfilling that role for their children or grandchildren. Lucy Mathen, presenter I was working on a local newspaper called the Surrey Mirror, discovering that I was utterly suited to journalism: unafraid to knock on doors, able to write up juicy court cases and interrogate officials about local injustices. All for £18 a week. I met Newsround creator Edward Barnes at a friend’s 21st birthday party and spoke endlessly about the stories I’d been working on, from the IRA bombings in Caterham to a scoop interview I’d managed to get with Richard Burton. A few days later, I received a call from Newsround. They were looking for a full-time reporter: was I interested? Before I knew it, I was out with a BBC camera crew, reporting on stories, very much in at the deep end. We found the right language and visuals to report even the most difficult stories, without patronising our audience. It turned out this was what many adult viewers wanted, too. Some of my greatest fans were pub landlords, who made sure that they tuned in at 5pm before opening up. My four-year presence on Newsround in the 1970s was important for another reason – I was the first female British Asian reporter on a nationwide news programme. John and I also co-presented Newsround Extra and a series on Africa. I went on to report and present other TV programmes, then I retrained as a doctor and now run a charity tackling blindness in India. I am most remembered for Newsround, though, which has led to some surreal moments. On my first night on call as a junior doctor, I was struggling to take a blood sample in the early hours of the morning, but noticed that the patient kept looking at my NHS badge, which said: “Dr L Mathen.” I thought: “Is she going to report me for incompetence?” Then she asked: “Does the L stand for Lucy? Are you really Lucy Mathen who used to be on John Craven’s Newsround?” Newsround is on CBBC and BBC iPlayer daily. The programme celebrates its 50th anniversary on 4 April with a special film.

3/28/2022,"It was meant to be over by now, but the pandemic does not appear to be following the script. Covid has swept through schools once again in the past few weeks, with teachers going off sick again and desks emptying fast. The new extra-infectious variant of Omicron comes at just the wrong time for children who have already missed out on so much over the past two years and in England now face Sats, GCSEs or A-levels this spring. A report from the Commons education select committee, whose Tory chair Robert Halfon has doggedly worried away at this issue for two years, recently concluded that school closures in England had been “nothing short of a national disaster for children and young people”, with pupils in the most deprived areas up to eight months behind in some subjects and the government’s “catch-up” national tutoring programme (NTP) failing to deliver in precisely the places that need it most. Schools have reported tutoring companies cancelling lessons at the last minute, or sending tutors with no knowledge of the subject they’re supposed to be teaching; frustrated headteachers told the committee they could have spent the money better themselves. All this makes getting children back even to where they were pre-Covid a challenge, never mind taking great leaps forward. Yet this week the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, published an ambitious white paper confirming new higher targets in reading, writing and maths for primary schoolchildren in England plus improved GCSE results by 2030. He is right to be ambitious for children. But vague talk of a “parent pledge” that children who are falling behind will be helped – what does anyone think teachers were trying to do before now, exactly? – falls some way short of convincingly explaining how precisely they’re intending to work miracles: new figures released this week show that by autumn 2021 the average primary pupil was still 1.9 months behind in maths (although that’s a distinct improvement on the 2.8 months behind they were in summer). At a time when waiting lists for children’s mental health services are going through the roof (which means emotional and behavioural difficulties spilling over in class) and a cost of living crisis is plunging more families into desperate circumstances, something just doesn’t add up. Zahawi is far more sure-footed than his predecessor, Gavin Williamson, with a brisk track record of delivering as vaccines minister. He’s likely to get more of a grip on the catch-up programme and has hinted at giving schools more freedom to make arrangements that work for them. But he’s having to try to do it on the cheap, which rules out any genuinely big ideas. Kevan Collins, the government’s chosen catch-up “tsar”, resigned last year after his proposals were rejected as too expensive, and the more limited programme ministers eventually announced was tendered out last year to a surprisingly low bid from the Dutch private company Randstad, with predictably poor results (the select committee heard that the Randstad programme was a “bureaucratic nightmare” and that its online tuition hub was “dysfunctional”). Conjuring up trained teachers from thin air to help children who have missed out on months of proper lessons was never going to be easy. But as things stand the scenario everyone in education feared – that lockdown would unravel years of hard work to close the gap between rich and poor children – now risks becoming reality, with dismal consequences for children’s life chances. Home schooling was tough on everyone, but middle-class parents were better positioned to cope with it and could afford private help later if things did go awry. For their less fortunate classmates, the NTP should have been a lifeline but, as of last spring, had failed to reach over a third of its target schools in the north-east of England, and in Yorkshire and Humber, the two regions where children’s learning loss is deepest. So much for levelling up. The children’s commissioner for England, Rachel de Souza, a former headteacher, has meanwhile been warning of the number of so-called “ghost children” who have seemingly disappeared from the radar during the pandemic. In the summer of 2020, with debate raging over whether schools could safely open in the autumn, I spoke to the head of an inner-city secondary whose big worry was that after months at home some teenagers would just drop out and never return to education. At the other end of the age spectrum, fewer families are taking up the offer of free nursery places for two-year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds, places which help prepare them for school; children’s centres report families who have barely seen a professional face-to-face since their toddlers were born and have simply lost the habit of engaging with officialdom. Keeping schools open to all through the first lockdown, with neither vaccine nor immunity to an unknown new virus, sadly wasn’t a viable prospect: even if Boris Johnson had tried it, schools would simply have had to shut anyway as teachers went down sick. By limiting the spread of infection, school closures probably saved the lives of parents and grandparents. But now we should be focusing all our energies on making up for what children have missed. They don’t have to become a “lost generation”, for ever scarred. But it is infuriating that so many chances to turn things around have already been wasted: if we don’t act decisively then we will be living with the social, academic and economic consequences of having let these young people down for years to come.

3/28/2022,"The always-compelling German actor Nina Hoss (best known for Barbara and Phoenix, her collaborations with director Christian Petzold) stars as a neurotic, conflicted violin teacher and mother in this sticky, stop-start drama set in the exacting, pressurised realm of classical music. Those who know this world are aware that it’s an arena where fierce discipline and innate talent is required to succeed and secure coveted spots at, first, highly competitive schools and then, for adults, in ensembles and orchestras. Not all music teachers are Mr Holland’s Opus-style nurturers for sure, but films such as this one as well as Michael Haneke’s The Piano Teacher and, to an extent, the jazz-angled Whiplash, love to dwell on characters whose minds are contorted into all kinds of perverse, emotionally mangled shapes by their devotion to excellence. Hoss’s Anna is a less outre version of this tortured-or-torturing music teacher meme, a woman whose backstory and psychology gets filled in somewhat ploddingly by writers Daphne Charizani and Ina Weisse. (Weisse, an actor herself, also directs.) The only child of a forbidding and cruel father, Anna has developed an almost-morbid fear of failure that hobbled her career as a violinist, which would explain why she’s become a teacher. Now married to a schlubby-sexy French instrument-maker (played by Simon Abkarian), Anna pushes her son Jonas (Serafin Mishiev) to play the violin as well, even though the poor kid would clearly prefer to help dad in the workshop or play ice hockey instead. (God forbid any of the kids in this world might play video games or listen to rock music.) When Anna volunteers to coach the adolescent Alexander (real-life prodigy Ilja Monti) to help him get into Berlin’s top conservatory, she becomes obsessed with shaping his talent, pushing him relentlessly in a way that not only upsets her family but threatens to break Alexander’s spirit. In light of the strange, brutal ending that’s more foreshadowed than it seems, it’s hard to work out where Weisse wants to land on issues around the best way to coax talent, especially in fields such as music where you have to put in a relentless amount of hours to achieve the highest results. We’re clearly meant to infer Anna is a few horsehairs short of the full bow given her weird other relationships in the film – like the strangely cold/erotic interactions with both her husband and a handsome cellist co-worker (Jens Albinus) who invites her to join his string quintet, and that’s not a sexual euphemism. It’s not even clear if Anna and the latter are actually having an affair or whether they just like to make out furtively in hallways. (“Touch my breast. Now the other one,” she commands him before abruptly storming off after a fraught experience.) Thankfully, there’s no bodily self-mutilation, although sudden presto violence forms part of the story.

3/28/2022,"Novaya Gazeta, one of Russia’s last remaining independent news outlets, has said it will cease operations until the end of the war in Ukraine after it received a second warning from the state censor for allegedly violating the country’s “foreign agent” law. The warning came a day after its editor-in-chief, Dmitry Muratov, spoke with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a group interview with Russian journalists that was quickly banned by the state media watchdog, Roskomnadzor. Novaya Gazeta is one of the country’s most important independent publications. A number of its journalists have been killed since the 1990s in retaliation for their reporting, including on the war in Chechnya. The Roskomnadzor warning to Novaya Gazeta was allegedly prompted by the newspaper’s failure to identify a “foreign agent” in an unspecified publication. But it appeared to be an act of retaliation for the newspaper’s decision to report on the war and Muratov’s participation in the interview with Zelenskiy. In an effort to avoid being shut down, the newspaper announced its surprise decision to halt publications until the end of Russia’s “special operation”, the Kremlin’s official term for the invasion. “We have received another warning from Roskomnadzor,” Novaya Gazeta’s editorial board wrote in statement. “Following this, we will suspend the publication of the newspaper online and in print until the end of the ‘special operation on the territory of Ukraine’.” The editorial board noted that the newspaper could have its licence revoked because it had received two warnings from Roskomnadzor. It received the first warning last week. Muratov, who received the Nobel peace prize in 2021 for his efforts to support journalistic freedoms in Russia, had decided to continue publishing Novaya Gazeta while obeying a Roskomnadzor directive that forbids journalists from describing the conflict as a “war” or “invasion”. While other outlets such as Echo of Moscow and TV Rain were banned from Russia, Novaya Gazeta had continued reporting on the war and on the impact of sanctions on Russia’s economy. It is one of the only Russian news outlets to have a correspondent in Ukraine filing dispatches about the impact of the war on Ukrainians. “I want to express absolutely my solidarity with Novaya Gazeta, its journalists and its editor-in-chief,” wrote Alexey Venediktov, the former editor of Echo of Moscow. “I hope that you will soon return to your readers, and therefore to me.”",News/World news,Russian news outlet Novaya Gazeta to close until end of Ukraine war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/28/russian-news-outlet-novaya-gazeta-to-close-until-end-of-ukraine-war
3/28/2022,"Fuel poverty campaigners have written to Britain’s energy regulator urging it to take action to reduce electricity standing charges, which it says are discriminatory. When the energy price cap rises on Friday, most households will face an increase of at least 80% in the standing charges they pay for electricity, with much of the extra cost a result of the failure of 30 suppliers during 2020. The standing charge is applied daily, and is charged regardless of how much energy the customer uses. In a letter to Ofgem, Fuel Poverty Action said the poorest consumers were “paying for negligent policymaking”, and that the “injustice of the standing charge must urgently be addressed”. Customers of these suppliers have been switched to new providers and their balances have been guaranteed; the cost of doing this has been added to all bills. Analysts’ estimates of how much each household will pay as a result vary, but Fuel Poverty Action said that typically, £68 of the £75 increase in standing charges would be because of supplier failure. Vulnerable customers on prepayment meters or those who pay their bills by cheque or cash rather than direct debit pay the highest standing charges, and are the least likely to have switched provider in the past. The Fuel Poverty Action co-director, Ruth London, said: “Why have Ofgem decided to make the poorest customers pay for their bad decisions and for bad practice in the industry? This huge injustice must be urgently reversed.”She added: “Prepayment meters are another way that people with the least resources – and often with the leakiest, most poorly insulated homes – are forced to pay the highest price for fuel. “These meters are often imposed without consent, cost more than direct debit, and have the effect of cutting people off supply. As prices increase, it is absolutely urgent to end such upside down policies. Details of average standing charges published by Ofgem show that, from 1 April, direct debit customers will typically pay 45p a day to their electricity provider, up from 25p a day now, and 27p a day for gas, up from 26p now. Those increases add £76.65 a year to an average bill. For prepayment customers, electricity standing charges will rise to an average of 50p a day, and gas 37p. For cash and cheque customers electricity standing charges will be 51p a day and gas 32p. Beneath these headline averages are regional differences. For direct debit customers in London, electricity standing charges are rising to 31p on Friday, while in the south-west of England they will increase to 49p. An Ofgem spokesperson said: “Our top priority is to protect consumers including making sure bill payers pay a fair price. We know this is a challenging time. Customers struggling to pay for energy may be eligible for extra help such as debt repayment plans, emergency credit for prepayment metered customers, priority support and schemes like the winter fuel payment or warm home discount rebate. “We are strengthening the retail market through effective stress testing of suppliers, which will reduce the cost of companies leaving the market as far as possible.” Fuel Poverty Action is campaigning for a new pricing structure which it calls Energy for All, which gives all households energy to cover their basic requirements for free, with the cost covered by a windfall tax. A petition calling on the government to adopt this policy has attracted more than 300,000 signatures.",Lifestyle/Money,"Cut ‘unjust’ electricity standing charges, UK regulator urged",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/28/electricity-standing-charges-uk-energy-suppliers
3/28/2022,"Meet the face of the war for millions of Ukrainians hunkering down in their homes. Marichka Padalko, 46, is among a small coterie of TV news anchors with a platform to guide the country through the daily and nightly war developments while teasing out psychological advice from studio experts and offering practical tips on everything from shelter etiquette to surviving a chemical weapons attack. She became central to people’s lives when, two days after Vladimir Putin announced his “special military operation”, the four main channels on Ukrainian television decided to work together to create one 24/7 “marathon” news show. With journalists and technicians – particularly those with young families – fleeing the shelling, leaving channels understaffed, and given the risk of a studio being hit by a Russian bomb, the peacetime professional rivals combined their efforts to guarantee the news would stay on air. The result is that Padalko, a host on 1+1, which was one of Ukraine’s biggest channels in peacetime, and a further 11 anchors who appear during any given 24-hour period, have a captive audience. “It is something like if BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 [came together]. Technically we’re not united. I mean, we are all in different locations, but all channels now have their own slot, six hours a day. Sometimes we are in the morning, sometimes at night,” she said. For the viewers, she said, the broadcasting teams were “somehow a symbol of normality or some connection to their previous life where they used to see us and we were part of the routine of their life”. If they are not live on air, anchors and their reporting teams wait in reserve ready to broadcast from a back-up studio in a secret location, where Padalko is based, in case an air raid siren goes off or a bomb hits those reading the news in the capital, Kyiv, or elsewhere. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, last week signed a decree to make the arrangement obligatory, citing the need to avoid Russian misinformation. To the upset of some media magnates, with perhaps their own political interests to protect, the decree also mandated that smaller channels also use the content in place of their normal news slots. Some have suggested that the News United initiative stifles freedom of speech. Padalko, who along with her co-host, Yegor Gordeev, 32, was the first and only news anchor on air in the period immediately after Putin launched his war by sending missiles into Kyiv and elsewhere, disagrees. “Nobody’s sending us any instructions,” she said. “The only instructions I think we had at the very beginning is just to be more supportive for the audience who are going through difficult times.” The only stipulation from Zelenskiy’s government is that they are mindful of the danger of rumour and misinformation, she says, and that they offer news for those watching from their front rooms, kitchens and beds. “We have guests who can give practical advice, or volunteers who can talk about evacuations, or people who deal with chemical weapons dangers, advising people whether they should buy something to protect themselves from any possible chemical weapon attack,” she says. “We do have psychologists at least once a week, advising [viewers] that they do not feel guilty that they left their home towns or not to hate people who left, or not to watch the news 24-hours a day. That it’s OK to relax sometimes and not to think about the war because some people, if they don’t feel sad or don’t cry, they feel guilty that somebody is now suffering.” Lighter subjects touched upon by the combined news show have included ways to relax – including by having sex – the changing nature of stand-up comedy in wartime, and the proliferation of new songs telling the Russians to “fuck off”. A famous Ukrainian poet, Serhiy Zhadan, was also filmed reading his poems to people sheltering in a bunker. She was advised that the role of the anchor was important as viewers would find reassurance in seeing a “real person that they’ve known for years talking about this and their reaction to this and how they behave themselves,” she said. “Especially being a morning presenter, people write to me that they remember me in their morning routine, getting up, coffee, TV, getting the kids to school. First, they want to see the news and, second, a person they know talk about this news and the third thing is to know what to do.” Padalko, who with her colleagues has also been given advice by a psychologist on how to cope, said journalists who did not usually anchor shows had been drafted in. “Some top anchors are gone because they are women and they had to – and I understand – to take care of the kids and to take them away,” she said. “Mostly, at least in Ukraine, we have more women anchors than men … they had to make a choice – will they stay, or go to take care of the children? – especially if they are single mothers.” Padalko had her own dilemma. Her husband, Yegor Sobolev, 45, a former Ukrainian MP, joined the army on the first day of the war. With schools closed, she was faced with working and caring alone for her three children, Mykhailo, 15, Maria, 13 and Katia, 11. “I was saying that my job is not less important than your desire to go into the army. We had a lot of fights. The day before the war, he said: ‘I think we should already take our kids to western Ukraine.’ And I said: ‘No, I have a morning shift tomorrow and a morning shift on Friday and I can go after Friday,’ because my next week was going to be open. And he said: ‘No, I’m taking the kids.’” Today, Padalko, whose husband is fighting on the northern outskirts of Kyiv, says she is relieved. Her children are in a hotel with their grandparents in the west of the country. She visits them once a week. “I’m very lucky for the decision my husband took on that day. I did my best to work as long as I could, not to be thinking about where my kids are. In this sense, I was lucky, unlike many female journalists who had to care for their children.” Padalko added: “I love my job. I have a huge response from people on social media who are writing that they are happy to see us, that they feel united because we didn’t go away from Ukraine.”",News/World news,‘I love my job’: life as a Ukrainian TV news anchor and mother,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/28/i-love-my-job-life-as-a-ukrainian-tv-news-anchor-and-mother
3/28/2022,"P&O Ferries has “one last opportunity” to U-turn on the sacking of 800 crew and must lift this week’s deadline for the employees to sign redundancy and non-disclosure agreements, the government has warned. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, wrote to the firm’s chief executive, Peter Hebblethwaite, on Monday spelling out his intention to legislate, informing him that P&O Ferries would be “left with little choice but to reverse your decision in any case”. He warned Hebblethwaite that his position as chief executive and a director “has become untenable”. In the letter, which Shapps posted on Twitter, he also outlined plans to bring in a package of measures to “block the outcome that P&O Ferries has pursued, including paying less than the minimum wage”. It came as the Commons transport and business committees wrote a joint letter to Shapps demanding Hebblethwaite be struck off as a company director as “not a fit and proper person” after he “flaunted his contempt for the law” at last week’s hearings into the mass sackings on 17 March across P&O Ferries’ UK fleet. Hebblethwaite admitted the firm broke the law by dismissing the workers without consultation, amid plans to bring in cheaper agency crew at below minimum wages, saying: “There’s absolutely no doubt we were required to consult with the unions. We chose not to do that.” The MPs also urged the government to impose the “unlimited fine” it has threatened if it decides P&O Ferries has broken laws that require it to notify the relevant authorities of impending layoffs. Documents published by the committees show that P&O Ferries’ Jersey office sent Insolvency Service forms on 17 March – the day of the sackings rather than at the required 30-45 days’ notice – to the relevant flag state authorities of the ships in Bermuda, Cyprus and the Bahamas. The forms spell out the legal duty to give notice, but also state: “If it is not reasonably practicable for you to comply with the minimum notification periods you must make every effort do so as far as you are able. You must give reasons why you could not provide the information on time.” The P&O Ferries local agency director wrote on the form that no notice was given because: “To minimise disruption to the vital services we run on major sea routes, it was essential for the business to carry out the restructure as quickly and efficiently as possible.” Unions were meeting with the two other large ferry operators from UK ports, DFDS and Stena Line, and government officials on Monday to discuss the crisis and alternative provision of services. The RMT general secretary, Mick Lynch, said: “The sacked workers have to be reinstated and we need regulation and legislation to secure UK-based seafarers’ jobs and agreed contracts of employment.” P&O sailings from Dover to Calais have been cancelled up to this Thursday and those between Larne in Northern Ireland and Cairnryan in Scotland remain suspended.

3/28/2022,"On 2 March, as the number of Ukrainian refugees fleeing Russia’s brutal invasion reached 1 million, the United Nations security council called an emergency session of the general assembly. There, 193 nations reviewed a resolution on Russia’s “aggression against Ukraine” and voted overwhelmingly to approve it: 141 votes in favor, 35 abstentions and just five votes against. Even some of Russia’s closest allies on the continent – Serbia, for example, or Hungary – voted to condemn the invasion. “The message of the general assembly is loud and clear,” said the UN secretary general, António Guterres. What exactly is that message? In recent days, many commentators have pointed to a global map of the UN resolution to demonstrate the unity of the west and the world in taking on the Putin government. But to make sense of the geopolitical consequences of the Russian invasion, we must look beyond the diplomatic theater of the general assembly to examine how these nations are actually engaged with the war in this phase of rapid escalation. And to do that, we should start with a very different map of the world – a map of global participation in the sanctions set against Russia by the United States and its allies. The contrast between these maps could not be more striking. The US, the UK, Canada, South Korea, Switzerland, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Singapore, the EU: beyond this fortified coalition, very few nations have chosen to take part in the economic warfare set against the Putin government. On the contrary, many of the world’s largest nations – including China, India, Brazil, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia and even Nato ally Turkey – have refused to join in. “We will not blindly follow the steps taken by another country,” said Indonesia’s foreign ministry representative at a recent press conference. Latin America has been equally steadfast in its commitment to neutrality. “We do not consider that [this war] concerns us,” said the Mexican president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. “We are not going to take any sort of economic reprisal because we want to have good relations with all governments.” Argentina may have voted to condemn Russia’s actions at the UN, but its foreign minister, Santiago Cafiero, was adamant about his country’s non-participation in the new sanctions push: “Argentina does not consider that they are a mechanism to generate peace and harmony, or generate a frank dialogue table that serves to save lives.” The Latin American position has been echoed in Africa. “For five centuries, we have been pawns in the hands of the warring European states, bent on looting Africa of its human and natural sources,” says Pierre Sané, president of the Imagine Africa Institute and former secretary-general of Amnesty International. Sané tells me that the Ukrainian embassy in Senegal has been recruiting “volunteer” mercenaries from countries like Senegal and Ivory Coast to fight in the war. “Should this war in Ukraine escalate, we say and we say it loud: do not bring it to our shores.” Amid the Russian army’s brutal advance into Ukraine, a slew of letters, articles and Twitter commentary has addressed the “western left” for its apparent unwillingness to take on the Putin government. The invasion of Ukraine has been described as a “test” to root out the “pseudo-leftists” who fail to respond with force and conviction to support the west in its effort to isolate, undermine and eventually topple Putin in defense of the Ukrainian cause. But the map of sanctions suggests that the true rift is not between left and right, nor even between east and west. On the contrary, the map reveals a rift between north and south, between the nations that we call developed and those we call developing. And by revealing this tectonic shift, the map can tell us something important about geopolitics in the coming age of multipolarity. The rapid rise of China and the US reaction it has provoked have prompted many commentators to predict a coming cold war. Few expected Vladimir Putin to kick it off so suddenly. “Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has ended Americans’ 30-year holiday from history,” writes the former CIA director Robert Gates for the Washington Post. The immediate eviction of Russian representatives and Russian culture from the institutions of the west suggest the long slumber of the cold war may indeed be over: “Putin’s war has provided the cold shower needed to awaken democratic governments to the reality of a new world.” The good news for Gates is that the Biden administration has already found its cold war footing. Its flagship Summit for Democracy strives to unite “the nations of the free world” – a remarkable homage to the era of anti-Soviet mobilization – while isolating autocracies like Russia and China. That is, with the usual exceptions: Saudi Arabia’s oil, for example, grants the nation a free pass to the “free world”, as made evident by the recent delegation dispatched by the Biden administration to secure the kingdom’s support to keep the oil flowing through the war effort in Ukraine. In the age of unipolarity – in the long 30-year holiday that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union – the nations of the world were given a rather simple choice: side with the United States, or stand alone. Some nations sought to band together in collective acts of resistance to this hegemonic power. But the consequences were all but inevitable: invasions, coups and extensive sanctions to isolate their economies from the world at large. As new powers generate new poles, however, the options available to US neighbor nations are no longer restricted to compliance and resistance. A third option emerges: neutrality. “Neutrality does not mean indifference,” says Pierre Sané. “Neutrality means continuously calling for the respect of international laws; neutrality means that our hearts still go to the victims of military invasions and arbitrary sanctions never imposed on Nato countries.” Back in the first cold war, neutrality had a name: non-alignment. As the United States clashed with China and the Soviet Union in the skies above Korea, Jawaharlal Nehru and Josip Broz Tito refused to take a side. “The people of Yugoslavia cannot accept the postulate that humanity today has only one choice – a choice between a domination of one or the other bloc,” Yugoslavia’s minister of foreign affairs, Edvard Kardelj, told the UN in 1950. “We believe that there exists another road.” The Non-Aligned Movement was born five years later, uniting more than 100 nations around the world around principles of non-interference and peaceful coexistence. Today, nations around the world are called again to take sides – between Russia and the west, and very soon between the west and China. But as the map of sanctions attests, the cross-pressure between these great powers may once again spark a movement for non-alignment, demanding a more universal application of international law against demands for unilateral exception. There will no doubt be consequences for this neutral position. Non-aligned nations in the first cold war were frequently victim to aggression, invasion and economic embargo. The same risks to neutrality are visible today. Lithuania recently canceled a shipment of Covid vaccines to Bangladesh for its refusal to condemn Russia at the United Nations. The US, for its part, has already passed the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Caatsa), giving license to punish countries with sanctions for trading with the other side. But as great powers prepare for a new century of war, the call for non-alignment will only grow louder. Our task is to understand that call now as Tito and Nehru understood it then: not as “neutralism” or “passivity, as is sometimes alleged”. As they wrote in a joint declaration in 1954: “It represents the positive, active and constructive policy that, as its goal, has collective peace as the foundation of collective security.”  This article was amended on 28 March 2022 to clarify that the embassy Pierre Sané referred to as recruiting “volunteer” mercenaries from countries like Senegal and Ivory Coast, was the Ukrainian embassy in Senegal.

3/28/2022,"Britain’s economy is expected to suffer a growth slowdown amid the biggest single shock from energy prices since the 1970s, the governor of the Bank of England has warned. Andrew Bailey said there were signs of slowing demand from consumers and businesses as they come under heavy pressure from the cost of living squeeze, with soaring prices for gas, electricity and other goods and services. “The shock from energy prices this year will be larger than any single year in the 1970s,” he said at an event held by the Bruegel thinktank in Brussels on Monday. “The caveat is that the 1970s had a succession of years and we very much hope that would not be the case now. But as a single year, this is a very, very big shock.” Threadneedle Street said earlier this month that inflation could reach 8% this spring after a sharp rise in household gas and electricity bills due on Friday. With inflation already surging before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it said global energy prices being pushed higher by the war could drive UK inflation close to 10% later this year. The central bank has responded by raising interest rates, which now stand at 0.75% after a 0.25 point increase at its March policy meeting, as it put concerns over high inflation ahead of the impact on economic growth to stop the current bout of rising prices from becoming more persistent in future. The Bank has a target to steer inflation close to 2%. Bailey suggested on Monday that the cost of living squeeze was likely to hit the UK’s economic growth rate as households and companies tighten their belts due to the increase in the price of energy and other goods and services. “We expect it to cause growth and demand to slow. We’re beginning to see the evidence of that in both consumer and business surveys,” he said, suggesting that weaker rates of growth could lead to a cooling of inflation without the need for significant interest rate hikes from the central bank. “We expect that this pressure on demand will weigh down on domestically generated inflation. For that reason we do expect inflation to return to target, two years or so out from now.” The Office for Budget Responsibility, the government’s economic forecaster, last week downgraded its 2022 growth forecasts from 6% to 3.8% while warning that the highest rate of inflation in four decades would hit consumer demand. Analysts expect the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee to raise interest rates to 1% when it next meets in early May. While financial markets point to its key interest rate rising to 2% by the end of the year, some economists have suggested a weaker growth outlook would reduce the need for such a sharp rise in borrowing costs. Bailey said there were “risks to the outlook for inflation from both sides,” with a high degree of uncertainty facing the UK economy. “We’ve got a pandemic followed by a European war, in any scale that is a very difficult position to be in for policy.”",News/Business,Bank of England expects UK energy shock on the scale of the 1970s,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/28/bank-of-england-expects-uk-energy-shock-on-the-scale-of-the-1970s
3/28/2022,"After Great Pain … After great pain, a formal feeling comes –The Nerves sit ceremonious, like Tombs –The stiff Heart questions ‘was it He, that bore,’And ‘Yesterday, or Centuries before’? The Feet, mechanical, go round –A Wooden wayOf Ground, or Air, or Ought –Regardless grown,A Quartz contentment, like a stone – This is the Hour of Lead –Remembered, if outlived,As Freezing persons, recollect the Snow –First – Chill – then Stupor – then the letting go – Emily Dickinson begins her poem by demonstrating rhythmically the “formal feeling” that succeeds “great pain”. The pain isn’t specified, and could be physical, but there are strong suggestions that it’s the response to death, the pain of mourning. This pain’s aftermath is a physically embodied numbness, almost an absence of response, almost a living death. In that extraordinary second-line simile, “[t]he Nerves sit ceremonious, like Tombs-” it’s impossible to resist the image of the nerves themselves being enlarged into tomb-like objects. They are death’s presence in the body, and the first sight of the stoniness and heaviness which dominate the imagery. But we can also think of mourners who “sit ceremonious” at a funeral, and who may talk, as the “stiff Heart” talks, about “He that bore”. “He” is clearly Christ (the one that bore our sins in Christian phraseology). The words would be murmured by mourners in prayer at a funeral service. But it’s significant that it’s phrased as a question “was it He, that bore” and that the phrase breaks off without an object. It’s possible that the “He” could also represent a soldier burdened with a backpack. The poem written in 1862, when the American civil war was intensifying. The final question asking if the event was “Yesterday, or Centuries before” suggests a current resonance, and almost makes Christ and the soldier interchangeable. Continuing the analogy with the mourner’s state of mind in stanza two, the tired marcher moves woodenly, and the feet are nailed to the wood of the cross. The “wooden way” is further dramatised, with an image of walking the air (as in violent death and/or psychological dissociation) and the compulsion of duty (“Ought”). There is also, of course, an echo of “aught” (meaning “anything at all”) in this brilliantly coined noun. This stanza, although it begins and ends with the iambic pentameter of the first, is disrupted by shorter lines of two, three and two beats respectively. There are five lines altogether, and only the last two rhyme. In the last stanza, formality is almost restored, as a new analogy replaces “the hour of lead” – the process of being frozen to the point of unconsciousness. But there’s a simultaneous movement towards consolation in the thought that the frozen stasis can be “outlived” and might be transformed, by a “letting go” that isn’t that of death but the recovery of life. Dickinson’s powerful images of lead and coldness recall those of a letter she wrote to Samuel Bowles in 1862, concerning the death of her brother Austin’s friend, Frazer Stearns, in the battle of New Bern. “Austin is chilled – by Frazer’s murder – He says – his Brain keeps saying over ‘Frazer is killed’ – ‘Frazer is killed,’ just as Father told it – to Him. Two or three words of lead – that dropped so deep, they keep weighing –”. It seems that the poem’s finely deployed psychological observations may have begun with an experience which brought the civil war very close to home.",Arts/Books,Poem of the week: After Great Pain … by Emily Dickinson,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/28/poem-of-the-week-after-great-pain-by-emily-dickinson
3/28/2022,"Two of Donald Trump’s top former advisers, Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino, are facing mounting legal peril after the House committee investigating the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol moved a step closer to recommending criminal charges against them. The members of the committee were expected to meet on Monday night to discuss whether to hold Navarro, Trump’s former trade adviser, and Scavino, his former deputy chief of staff, in criminal contempt of Congress. A contempt report released on Sunday accused the two men of ignoring subpoenas that require them to hand over documents and face questions from the committee. The committee is expected to vote unanimously to recommend charges, triggering a House vote. The recommendation would then pass to the Department of Justice, which would decide whether to prosecute. Scavino, 46, and Navarro, 72, were intimately involved in efforts to subvert the results of the 2020 election so Trump could hang on to power. The contempt report says Scavino attended “several meetings with the president in which challenges to the election were discussed”. It also refers to Scavino having monitored a website, TheDonald.win, on which individuals planned violence in the run-up to January 6. Navarro was a prominent advocate of false claims of voter fraud. He has openly talked about a plan known as the “Green Bay Sweep”, which involved attempting to persuade lawmakers in battleground states to object to Joe Biden’s victory, in the hope of delaying certification in Congress. Both former Trump aides are accused by the committee of having failed to meet the demands of their subpoenas. Scavino, who was subpoenaed in September, has been granted six extensions but has yet to produce a document or testify, the contempt report said. Navarro, who was issued a subpoena last month, has declined to discuss any issues with the committee despite having addressed several in his own book, In Trump Time, published last November. The committee argues that his voluntary disclosures as an author make a mockery of his claim of executive privilege as justification for non-cooperation. Scavino also insists he is not able to testify because Trump has invoked executive privilege. The Biden administration has said it will not use executive privilege to shield individuals from having to provide documents and other information. The supreme court in February rejected Trump’s request to block the transfer of thousands of documents from the National Archives. Scavino and Navarro argue that the wider question of executive privilege is unsettled. The Capitol riot erupted after Trump exhorted supporters to “fight like hell” to stop Congress certifying Biden’s victory. The US Senate has linked seven deaths to the riot, in which more than 100 law enforcement officers were injured. Nearly 800 people have been charged in connection with the attack, some with seditious conspiracy. Contempt referrals have been sent to the DoJ for two other central Trump figures. Steve Bannon, Trump’s former strategist, was charged in November by a federal grand jury. He has pleaded not guilty. Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff at the time of the Capitol assault, was referred to the DoJ. It is still reviewing the evidence. The January 6 committee also made a contempt referral for Jeffrey Clark, a former DoJ official who promoted an attempt to delay certification of results in key states. He was spared a vote in the House after he agreed to appear before the committee – though he went on to invoke his right to silence more than 100 times.",News/US news,Ex-Trump aides move step closer to being held in contempt of Congress,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/28/peter-navarro-dan-scavino-contempt-congress-january-6
