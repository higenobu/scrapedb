1/31/2022,"Tech startups have transformed our lives in ways barely conceivable even a decade ago, with lots more innovation promised to come. And though it might appear we’re all just staring at screens, technology is connecting people like never before. We met three exciting young British tech startups to get an insight into the connectivity revolution. Inclusivity through equality“Tedious and unfulfilling Zoom meetings” drove Chris Rabbitt to the conclusion that “the optimum number of people to have in a meeting was four”. Hybrid working is here to stay, Rabbitt says, “but people miss making real connections, as they are tired of massive Zoom rooms where they can’t get a word in edgeways”.  Rabbitt came up with Meeow, a “blind-date”-style networking and pitching platform for small and medium enterprises, where you get to meet three other business people selected by the platform each time. Launched in April, the company has high growth predictions for 2022. Meeow started on Zoom as an online business community and built up a loyal following and a group of ambassadors. But when Rabbitt and his team wanted to scale the business they realised they needed to create their own bespoke tech platform. Equality is a priority in their ethos: “The randomness of Meeow means that there is no unconscious bias in our platform – it’s important to us that we level the playing field for all business owners, regardless of their age, race, disabilities or sexual orientation,” says Rabbitt. “Meeow also removes the self-censorship people exhibit when deciding who they need to speak to.” Rabbitt is evangelical about how tech enables great cultural changes. “The next 12 months will be tremendously interesting as ideas born out of the pandemic begin to come to market,” he says, “I’m particularly excited by some of the fintech and future of work startups I’ve seen in recent months. Companies such as Work and Communications (WAC) are shaking things up in the gig economy, and Juggle in the jobs market. It’s a truly fascinating world to be a part of.” And connectivity is crucial for all of this. “It doesn’t just support our operation – it is our business,” says Rabbitt. “We are a truly digital business taking advantage of all the opportunities that connectivity affords.” Accessibility-led engagementWill Turner and Phil Steele came up with the idea of fitness tool GoJoe after a rain-soaked University of Leeds reunion sports event. It aims to bridge the gap between physical events and digital fitness apps, with the special sauce of “friendly, team-based, social competition”. GoJoe serves “neglected ‘ordinary Joes’ like us, who want to get and stay fit but don’t find existing products motivational all year round”, says Turner. “Existing fitness apps are great for invested athletes or for getting you started, but in our view don’t work well as longer-term, sustainable fitness solutions for most people.” After quickly achieving success in global accelerator challenges and securing major brands as corporate clients, GoJoe is now opening its second round of investment. Tech accessibility underpins the app, says Turner. “We’re a global digital product and we’re fully accessible and free for people to use. You don’t need an expensive bit of kit or a bike, for example, to be part of the GoJoe community and compete with friends, colleagues or celebrities – you really only need a smartphone. That’s allowed us to be present in more than 130 countries worldwide, including in some pretty remote places.” Connectivity for its customers runs through everything GoJoe does. “It’s played a part in some of the biggest decisions we’ve made as a tech company – in terms of developing our tech, integrating wearables, deciding which features to implement, and in how we engage across all our channels.” For Turner, tech means “turning everyday solo experiences into something more meaningful and social”. He’s passionate about how advancing changes in technology represent “a sea change in how we experience the world around us. We see some amazing opportunities for people to socialise their everyday fitness experiences and get closer to people virtually while exercising.” Infrastructure for innovationOmid Moallemi started social gifting app Prsnt in 2019 after discovering it was too late to send a friend a gift on his birthday. “A birthday card will take days and Amazon could only do next-day,” he says. He felt there was a better way to – quickly – express the emotional connection of gifting than a simple text message. Prsnt allows people to send a gift, such as a QR code, Starbucks voucher or a Deliveroo meal, all with a personalised video, direct to someone’s smartphone in under 15 seconds. With a background in product design and innovation, Moallemi used these skills to do what he sees as “overhauling the gifting process”. “There are several needs for the modern-day gift-giver – speed, convenience, personalisation and sustainability,” he says. “We service anyone with a birthday and a smartphone – which is a huge market.” Moallemi originally had the basic idea for Prsnt some 10 years ago but the infrastructure simply wasn’t in place. “Smartphone tech was fairly new, and the software systems weren’t available to process the Prsnt engine,” he says. “We have some great emerging tech that helps us, including digital payments and digital tokens from the brands.” Also passionate about tech’s power for good, Moallemi says: “It enhances our lives – it allows us to connect better, achieve more and ultimately create a better world. In a further 20 years’ time, we will live in a world full of technology that hasn’t been invented yet – and that to me is really exciting.” The right technology helps your business make game-changing moves.

1/31/2022,"Being a small business owner can be full of highs and lows. Working for yourself, or as part of a small team, in a “Soho” (small office/home office) setup can often be a lonely place. To unleash the full potential of your small business enterprise, you need to make connections. We explore five ways in which the right kind of network can help take you to the next level. The mentoring connectionIn the business world, the power of a good mentor is well known, and the statistics back up the benefits; according to a CNBC/SurveyMonkey Workplace Happiness survey, 91% of workers who have a mentor are satisfied with their jobs.  The 2014 Apprentice winner Mark Wright has grown Climb Online, the digital marketing business he started on the show, to a turnover of £5m a year. He credits the mentorship of Lord Sugar with some of his success. “It can be lonely and somewhat daunting running your own business, and the last couple of years have been particularly isolating for many,” he says. “Having someone to bounce ideas off who understands you and your business and who has been in the process themselves, is invaluable. It is reassuring when times are tough, and their support will navigate you through.” Of course, we can’t all call on someone like Lord Sugar, but a mentor who knows your industry or has been through similar struggles will help you feel less isolated. “A decent mentor won’t just tell you what you want to hear,” says Wright. “Their experience will enable them to provide you with relevant and tested feedback and to encourage you to think more clearly about your ideas and problems.” The community connectionThe power and value of community has been thrown into sharp relief in the events of the last couple of years, and business is no exception. Entrepreneur Eddie Whittingham sold his startup cybersecurity business last year to a Nasdaq-listed company, and now provides consultancy and support. He created GoFounder, a platform for startups, having felt frustrated at the lack of community when he was setting up his own business. “As a small business owner, having a community of people in a similar boat to you can be hugely helpful,” says Whittingham. “It sometimes feels like you’re really alone or that other people can’t relate, but the truth is, most business owners go through a lot of the same troubles. So being part of a community of other startup founders can be invaluable not only to your success but also your mental health.” The partnership connectionPeople who think collaboratively will always benefit in the long term, says Michael Edwards, founder of The Northern Affinity, a business community set up with the sole aim of connecting businesses based in the north. For Edwards, partnerships are crucial. “Running a small business often means you are competing with businesses that are bigger, better resourced and with bigger budgets than you. The only way you can compete is by being more agile and working with others to provide a fantastic service.” During the pandemic, Edwards says he’s seen “isolated business people engage in more virtual networking and rallying together virtually to support vulnerable people”. All this, he says, was driven by an increased awareness of how much everyone needed outside support. The tech connectionFor small businesses, getting the right infrastructure in place can be a hugely daunting task. But bandwidth is at the heart of almost every modern business function. With a powerful internet connection in place, minimising frustrating delays and hassles, you can start to build up to a level of tech that enables every employee to give their best. “As a tech communications consultancy, we wholeheartedly embraced the various uses of technology to keep the team connected,” says Heather Delaney, founder and managing director of London-based Gallium Ventures, “from workflow applications such as Slack and Google Meet all the way to the metaverse – for example, when the pandemic hit, we gave employees headsets to experiment with collaborating and social games in virtual reality. “By creating a solid technology infrastructure in which we can work virtually during the early days [of the pandemic], we have [had] no disruption to workflow [due to Covid waves].” The social connectionCreating a social media presence and boosting paid ads is one of the first steps most small businesses take in marketing. But, says Delaney, drilling down to who your company wants to connect to on social media, and how you want to speak to them, is the real key. “Although it is tempting to pay for a high-profile influencer to promote your product or service, this isn’t always the best approach,” she says. “Opportunities like this can be expensive and if their fans and followers are not relevant to your customer targets, the return on investment will be low.” Start with free activities to build a presence until you understand who your audience is and what their interests are, says Delaney. “Digital ads and influencer relations can then be the next step in driving sales, downloads or customer acquisition.” Want to make the right kind of business connections?

1/31/2022,"For more than two years, dozens of people in the Canadian province of New Brunswick have suffered from a distressing array of neurological symptoms, prompting speculation that they had fallen victim to an unknown degenerative illness. Provincial authorities are soon expected to release a report examining whether the cases are linked, or simply the result of misdiagnosis and clinical error. But as the public awaits the findings, those enduring the extreme symptoms say they’ve been left to suffer alone.  Victims and their families have described a frightening deterioration of bodies and minds, compounded by an agonizing wait for more information. Gabrielle Cormier, 20, dreamed of attending medical school. But in 2019, she began experiencing muscle pain, difficulty concentrating and vision problems. Her family initially suspected it was fatigue from sports. Soon, however, she could no longer keep her balance. Cormier can now walk only with a cane, has trouble speaking and is unable to focus enough to attend university classes. Her dream of becoming a doctor is slipping away. “It breaks our heart. Young people should be out living and enjoying themselves. Instead they’re dealing with these health issues that we can’t explain,” said Gabrielle’s stepmother, Stacie Quigley Cormier. “Politics is slowing everything down. And what people don’t have is time.” The broader public first became aware of the illness last March, after a leaked government memo asked doctors to be on the lookout for patients with symptoms similar to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The government called it a “cluster of neurological syndrome of unknown cause”. At the time, the province was working alongside federal scientists to make of the suspected cases. Internal documents obtained by freedom of information requests and seen by the Guardian show that after a battery of diagnostic tests proved inconclusive, the province’s department of environment and public health units began exploring the possibility of environmental causes, including blue-green algae, toxicity in shellfish, chronic wasting disease and even glyphosate, a controversial forestry herbicide. But cooperation with the federal government ended abruptly in late spring and the province took the lead of the investigation. They created an oversight committee to re-examine suspected cases and determine if errors had been made in the diagnostic process. Victims families say that after the province took over, the investigation slowed down. “Everything went black. There was no communication. There was no information, medical appointments weren’t moving as quickly any more … That’s when Gabrielle’s morale really started to go downhill,” said Quigley Cormier. “Our questions can’t be answered and she’s really started to lose hope.” The government first identified 48 suspected cases last spring, although medical sources say the figure is closer to 150, with many of those afflicted in their 20s and 30s. But the provincial government increasingly suspects there is no single mystery illness in the region. An October report ruled out any significant links between the victims or evidence of toxins in food sources, and a previous study found that eight people in the cluster died of known illnesses. That conclusion clashes with recent reports that caregivers in some suspected cases have also developed symptoms, which some experts suggested could indicate an environmental cause. The province of New Brunswick did not respond to questions about its investigation of the cluster and whether it plans to test for possible environmental contamination. Officials have not announced when the report will be released and families say they’ve been kept in the dark. But the province has already started advising those within the “cluster” they are no longer believed to have an unknown illness, even if those people still suffer from debilitating symptoms. Earlier this month, Johanne Boucher, who was one of the original 48, received a letter from the committee advising her that she was no longer a prospective case. The letter said she could be suffering from a type of progressive aphasia, a form of Parkinson’s or a variant of corticobasal degeneration. The committee suggested she take tests which the 63-year-old says she has already taken. “I was shocked,” she said, writing to the Guardian on Facebook Messenger as she lost the ability to speak in late 2021. “I can’t even order a coffee. All I can do is write. After nearly four years, I’ve seen two neurologists … and had countless tests. I don’t know what I have. The disease remains unknown.” Terriline Porelle, 33, is equally dismayed by how the province has handled her case. In the summer of 2020, Porelle, felt a sharp pain “like electric shock” in her leg. Porelle, an avid hiker, found that in the following days, the sensation moved throughout her body, reaching her arms and face. Like Gabrielle Cormier, her vision worsened. An optometrist told her the muscles in her eyes acted similarly to those of patients in their 70s and 80s. After forgetting how to write the letter Q, she saw her family doctor. But tests turned up nothing. A neurologist ruled out other possible conditions and her brain scan was clean. “I was relieved it wasn’t a tumour or something. But we still didn’t know what it was. I try not to obsess over it,” said Porelle, who has trouble moving around her house. “I have sleepless nights where I wonder how this happened. What’s going on with me?” Recently, Porelle was referred to a neuropsychologist by the province’s oversight committee. After speaking to the specialist over the phone for four hours, Porelle was told she likely had PTSD – not an unknown illness. She had previously suffered from depression and anxiety, but she says her current symptoms are nothing like that. “I just laughed. I was like, ‘Are you serious right now?’ I’m still trying to digest that.” Porelle, who lives in a rural community, says her mental function continues to deteriorate. She finds it hard to complete daily tasks without the help of her partner. “We’ve been given no resources from the government and no help,” she said. “I don’t know what to do. I try to keep positive, but it’s hard. There are days when I don’t know if I should even bother saving for retirement. Am I even going to live that long?”",News/World news,‘What’s going on with me?’ Canadian victims of mystery illness suffer alone,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/31/canada-new-brunswick-neurological-illness-victims
1/31/2022,"Armed counter-terrorism officers will be deployed on British cross-Channel ferries for the first time this summer, though government sources said there was no specific threat to passenger vessels. Firearms police from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC) are to be posted on ferries out of Dover, as well as on passenger ships between Newcastle and the Netherlands.  The move will tighten security on British ferries, which are unguarded and seen as vulnerable, with passengers not individually searched or given body scans when boarding, unlike those on planes or Eurostar trains. A government spokesperson said: “The government will always take the strongest possible action to protect our national security and our priority remains maintaining the safety and security of our citizens. “We are constantly developing protection for UK citizens against the threat of terrorism. This includes strengthening security by fully equipping law enforcement and emergency responders to respond to terrorist incidents, no matter where they occur.” It is understood about 40 CNC officers will be posted on a rotation basis on ferries with a trial starting in July. The CNC has officers available as a result of nuclear power stations being decommissioned. A senior counter-terrorism source told the Times that ferries were seen as extremely vulnerable and “completely unguarded”. “Ferries are the weak link when it comes to policing transport against terror attacks. Moving a handful of CNC officers to ferries makes sense and they will be a visible deterrent,” the source said. A government source confirmed to the Guardian there was “no specific threat to passenger vessels” and the treaty and other cooperation with France formed part of the UK government’s wider strategy to ensure it was able to protect UK citizens against terrorism “no matter where it occurs”. With the decommissioning of nuclear power stations, the number of officers required to protect them is falling. The decision to redeploy CNC officers is part of a plan to extend the force’s remit to enable them to offer services beyond the civil nuclear sector and provide support to other police forces. A UK-France maritime security treaty was signed in July to improve joint working. It will come into force once the UK and France have completed ratification procedures and is designed to mitigate against a high-threat security incident on a ferry or other large vessel in the Channel. The treaty includes provisions that would enable the UK and France to share security information concerning potential threats, mount swifter and stronger initial responses to serious security incidents, coordinate more efficient joint responses and cooperate more effectively in the aftermath of an attack or incident, a spokesperson said.",News/UK news,Armed counter-terrorism officers to be deployed on British cross-Channel ferries,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/31/armed-counter-terrorism-officers-british-cross-channel-ferries-security
1/31/2022,"Newcastle are close to signing the left-back Matt Targett from Aston Villa and are pushing to buy the 19-year-old striker Hugo Ekitike from Reims. Targett is due to have a medical after Villa, having brought in Lucas Digne from Everton, agreed to a deal.

Newcastle have offered €25m (£20.8m) plus add-ons for Ekitike and discussions include a possible sell-on clause.

1/31/2022,"For more than a month now, the press has been full of stories of “illegal” parties in Downing Street. The government, we are told, has almost ground to a halt because of the scandal. Given the coverage, one might easily get the impression that the law-breaking bash is a recent invention, something that could only happen in lockdown, driven by privilege and an unhealthy sense of entitlement. Yet the modern party began life as a crime just over a century ago, when the Volstead Act banned the production and sale of alcohol in the US. As the New York Times explained in 1920:  You cannot carry a hip flask.You cannot give away or receive a bottle of liquor as a gift.You cannot take liquor to hotels or restaurants and drink it in the public dining rooms.You cannot buy or sell formulas or recipes for homemade liquors.You cannot … It was not technically illegal to drink at home – but procuring the booze for a party meant breaking the law. Not that that stopped everyone. The first “cocktail parties”, claimed the hard-drinking writer F Scott Fitzgerald, who was at most of them, were held in 1921. By the following year the New York Times was complaining that the once-innocent word “party” now meant, by definition, an “inebriate” bash. Fitzgerald found the whole thing so intoxicating that he wrote one of the century’s defining novels, The Great Gatsby, about a bootlegger famous for his decadent parties and limitless cocktails. Prohibition was America’s first culture war, imposing the conservative morality of teetotal small towns on cities vilified as warrens of drunken immigrants – Italians with their wine, Irish with their whiskey, Germans with their beer. Revisionist historians claim it was a success, reducing illness and crime. But that’s a narrow view of an extreme attempt to remake modern life. Prohibition changed behaviour all right – for it put wild parties at the centre of modern culture. Cocktails, the classic lubricant of the 1920s party, may have helped hide the awful taste of bootleg spirits. Or perhaps they just got you drunk faster. Either way, the rise of cocktail parties redefined what a party was. Soon this cocktail scene had spread to Europe. Even though drinking was legal in the UK, the aristocratic Bright Young Things in 1920s England managed to give their parties a spectacular excess that outraged and entertained the onlooking, purportedly sober and dull, masses. When police deferentially but firmly tried to end a party at St George’s Baths, London, in 1928, the Bright Young guests, all boozing in their bathing costumes, tried to get the bobbies to join them in the pool. Another novelist, Evelyn Waugh, evoked the permanent drunkenness of the decade in Vile Bodies’ nauseous opening on a wave-tossed ship in the Channel: “Oh,” said the Bright Young People. “Oh, oh, oh.” “It’s just exactly like being inside a cocktail shaker,” said Miles Malpractice. Yet those who really wanted to party hard in the 20s and early 30s headed for Weimar Berlin or surrealist Paris, where the norms of the time were more profoundly defied. Brassaï’s 1931 photograph Gay Ball at Magic City is sometimes mistaken for an image of Weimar decadence but actually shows men in everything from full drag to black tie dancing at a decaying Paris amusement park that found a new lease of life as a gay party venue. Brassaï was delighted by its “immense, warm, impulsive fraternity”. The Weimar republic’s endless uneasy party is preserved in paintings such as Max Beckmann’s Die Nacht – a true party from hell, with bondage, in a room that’s drunkenly shrinking – and Otto Dix’s depictions of sailors, sex workers and jazz bands. It was crushed in 1933 when the Nazis came to power. But – in modern mythology at least – they kept the decadence going. The image of Nazis cavorting in wild romps was paradoxically created by Hitler’s own propaganda chief, Joseph Goebbels. After Hitler had the leaders of the SA, the party’s streetfighting wing, massacred in 1934, it was said at least one of the leaders was caught in bed with another man in a Bavarian hotel. Goebbels whipped this up into a denunciation of the SA as “asocial” Weimar types. But did the Nazis actually party hard? A Soviet war correspondent, Konstantin Simonov, told how when the Red Army entered Berlin in 1945 he found the wreckage of a final fascist feast. Some German officers and their girlfriends had sealed themselves in a bunker with as much champagne as they could find for a blowout worthy of the dying gods. A half-century later, artist Mat Collishaw restaged this debauched scene in a series of pictures called Burnt Almonds, portraying a “desperate last party of champagne, sex and cynanide”. Yet the artifice of his photographs acknowledges that an obscene party involving Nazi officers and sex workers mixes history with our fantasies of what evil looks like. The liberation of Paris in 1944 was welcomed with a much nicer orgy – a spontaneous bacchanal of drinking and sex took over the city. From there it was just a short hop to the postwar party era, where decadence was no longer the privilege of Bright Young Things but available to everyone in an age of consumer democracy and pop culture. Rock’n’roll generated parties to make Fitzgerald blush – yet here again the real mayhem was laced with fiction. What Marianne Faithfull and Mick Jagger got up to in 1967 is one of those fantasies. Britain was blown away when an overheated press added its own lurid details to what was actually a quiet drug-taking party at Keith Richards’ house, Redlands. The civilised, if trippy, evening became a myth of excess when police raided (egged on by the News of the World) and were horrified by the “strong sweet smell of incense”. It did result in one of the greatest modern British artworks, when Richard Hamilton turned a photo of Jagger and art dealer Robert Fraser handcuffed in a police van into his acid-coloured masterpiece Swingeing London 67. Rock stars, not least the Stones themselves, would party much harder. Unfortunately, some of the most shocking stories about Led Zeppelin’s antics appear to be absolutely true. Witnesses have confirmed the story of the sublime hard rock band’s hotel room party in 1969 involving a freshly caught shark – the hotel was on a Pacific pier – and a young woman. It’s best told by Frank Zappa in his song The Mud Shark: “Say one night you checked into the Edgewater Inn motel with a 8mm movie camera, enough money to rent a [fishing] pole, and, just to make it more interesting, a succulent young lady with a taste for the bizarre …” As they say on BBC iPlayer, these lyrics reflect the time in which they were written. So does the claim that people with dwarvism were paid to walk around Freddie Mercury’s party at the Fairmont hotel, New Orleans, in 1978 with plates of cocaine strapped to their heads. That seems to be folklore, but some of the many stories about this party must be true, such as that naked models wrestled in a pit filled with raw liver. One party this century that competed with it, and even had Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood in attendance among the much younger artists and fashion stars, was Kate Moss’s 30th in 2004. It reputedly climaxed with some of the guests taking part in an orgy at Claridge’s. With true erudition in party history, Moss called it The Beautiful and the Damned, after Fitzgerald’s second novel. Don’t stop me now … Compared with the sins of the rock patriarchs, the parties that got Britain’s authorities outraged in the late 1980s and early 90s were joyous and harmless. That didn’t stop the Criminal Justice Act 1994 using some unintentionally comic language to try to specify exactly what was so wrong with a rave. Section 63 on “powers to remove persons attending or preparing for a rave” defines one as “a gathering on land in the open air of 20 or more persons (whether or not trespassers) at which amplified music is played during the night (with or without intermissions) and … by reason of its loudness and duration and the time at which it is played, is likely to cause serious distress to the inhabitants of the locality”. It carefully explains that “for this purpose … ‘music’ includes sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats”. Music characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats once again pumped out illegally in 2020 at lockdown raves in warehouses left empty by the pandemic. Participants who were caught were, of course, fined without any need for a Cabinet Office inquiry to establish if they were at a rave or just a noisy, sweaty work meeting. Even before the pandemic so severely narrowed the field of social interaction for law-abiding citizens, the politics of wild parties was changing. Values are different. Many of the rock world’s legendary antics now look like abuse and elicit not amusement but revulsion. And there’s another kind of party that shocks: the depraved secret gatherings that rulers and the rich enjoy, or are imagined to enjoy. Here again fictional outrages abound, ever since Marie Antoinette went to the guillotine for imaginary crimes including depravity and keeping wine under her bed to bribe the Swiss Guards. But former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi’s “bunga bunga parties” appear to have been real. According to young women who were there, the politician and media magnate’s private gatherings started as dinner parties and ended with women having to strip and pole dance until Berlusconi chose his partner for the night. One account describes him starting the entertainment by producing a statuette with an enormous penis, which the women had to lick. A pole dancing room also features in recently released photographs of what is claimed to be Vladimir Putin’s new secret palace. If excess is always enlivened by a hint of the criminal, the definition of wildness will change with the laws. It’s a long way from The Great Gatsby’s Prohibition shindigs where flappers and stockbrokers danced in the moonlight, to Boris Johnson and the staff of 10 Downing Street getting in the Tesco rosé and M&S snacks. The scandal is in proportion to the limits imposed by lockdown on everyone else, of course. At the No 10 double party on the eve of Prince Philip’s funeral someone, it seems, drunkenly sat on a child’s swing and broke it. It’s a detail in its pathos worthy of Fitzgerald.",Arts/Culture,"Bootleggers, bondage and law-breaking bashes!

1/31/2022,"If it hadn’t cost him so much money, Antonio Conte could have been forgiven for tearing out his hair. During a typically earnest round-table transfer discussion, Sky Sports presenter Jo Wilson asked her colleague, Michael Bridge, for his thoughts on Tottenham Hotspur’s not entirely unexpected failure to sign Luis Díaz. On the back of footage filmed some weeks ago of an extremely morose, middle-aged Conte telling reporters: “For sure we need to improve the quality of our squad,” Bridge explained, with the gravitas one might expect from a father explaining to his small child that a beloved hamster has died, why the Italian won’t be improving it by securing the services of the Porto winger.  “Just on this player in particular, Spurs were prepared to match the fee and match everything which Liverpool are going to pay,” Bridge solemnly intoned. “I need to say this because I know that’s the case. On this occasion, I know the player just wants to go to Liverpool.” Going on to explain that this was no ordinary gazumping, that Liverpool’s interest in the player had been long term and they had not decided to out-bid Tottenham just to torment Conte for the hell of it, Bridge handed down his verdict. “Disappointment,” he said. “But Spurs will move on.” No strangers to transfer window disappointment, Spurs have little choice but to move on, and all associated with the club will hope to speed up the healing process by trying to “move on” several players who were once the subject of high-profile bids the club did successfully manage to get over the proverbial transfer line. Often unable to do right for doing wrong in the market, even when Spurs appear to have gotten one over on Premier League rivals their victories end up feeling pyrrhic. A penny for the thoughts of their chairman Daniel Levy if he ever surveys news stories from last July reporting that Manchester City were prepared to offer Riyad Mahrez, Gabriel Jesus, Raheem Sterling and Bernardo Silva in exchange for Harry Kane. In the six months since publication, three of the four City players rumoured to be part of the job lot the club was prepared to sacrifice have scored more top-flight goals than the striker Tottenham fought so hard to keep in the summer. Of course it behoves us to note there is no guarantee that the reported details of this potential summer mega-swap deal were even remotely true, and even if their bona fides stood up to scrutiny, the byzantine contract negotiations required for a deal involving so many box-office footballers, their representatives and a club chairman renowned for playing hardball would almost certainly have ended in tears. The torrents of bullshit which permeate and pollute each transfer window are now at such levels they rival the amount of effluent British water companies were recently discovered to dump into our coastal seas. As somebody who is regularly tasked with writing the early morning Rumour Mill for this newspaper’s website, it would be a gross dereliction of journalistic duty if I did not claim responsibility for at least a few metaphorical gallons’ worth. “Write what you know” has long been a sage bit of wisdom passed on to aspiring authors, but the mushroom clouds of rumours, counter-rumours, fan dissatisfaction and frenzied media speculation which plume over our biannual transfer windows increasingly seem to be generated by armies of journalists, broadcasters and In The Know fans often writing or talking about what they not only don’t know, but can’t possibly know. And all for the benefit of audiences who treat each new dollop of tittle-tattle and tell-all with healthy scepticism despite really wanting to believe it is true. While the peddling of idle transfer speculation is part of my job spec, it is one I remain ambivalent towards, having no real interest in which footballer might sign for what club until we’ve had the “Here we go!” from transfer guru Fabrizio Romano, the ink has dried on their contract and we’ve seen the photo of them beaming alongside their new manager while posing with the club shirt. While the endless hours of speculation with which Sky Sports News and various other media outlets fill their schedules in each window suggest demand for this harmless nonsense is high, I can’t be alone in having wished that, say, a fairly recent Deadline Day had been devoted to discussions about the 41 goals scored in the preceding weekend’s 10 Premier League matches, 16 of which came in Tottenham’s 6-1 smiting of Manchester United at Old Trafford on the same day Aston Villa famously beat Liverpool 7-2. Instead, viewers were treated to what seemed like half-hourly updates from Everton’s Finch Farm training centre regarding confirmed sightings of Ben Godfrey from a nervous reporter mindful of the fact that a colleague once had a large purple sex toy thrust in his ear by an over-enthusiastic fan while reporting from that very spot. When I am the king, there will be a blanket media ban on reports of all transfer speculation and dealings, with clubs forbidden from announcing Mbappé or anyone else until such time as the players in question run out to line up for their first game at their new team. If nothing else, it would be worth it to see the disappointment on the faces of Spurs fans when instead of Díaz, Adama Traoré and half of Manchester City’s first team, they are instead treated to the spectacle of the usual suspects being bawled out by a manager who could scarcely look more forlorn.",Sport/Football,Tottenham’s transfer travails strike familiar note amid empty noise | Barry Glendenning,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/31/tottenham-transfer-travails-strike-familiar-note-amid-empty-noise
1/31/2022,"Few people outside of south Texas, and even fewer outside the state, have heard of US representative Henry Cuellar, though he is one of the state’s most fascinating elected officials. But now the nation may know him as yet another member of Congress tied to a federal investigation. A recent FBI raid at this nine-term Democratic congressman’s home and campaign headquarters in Laredo, on the US-Mexico border, has potentially significant implications for Washington politics: it deals another blow to the art of compromise, a once-essential legislative tool, and one that Cuellar has mastered in his long political career.  The FBI raid on January 19 is part of an investigation of several people with ties to the former Soviet nation of Azerbaijan. I have no direct knowledge of the nature of the federal investigation – and Cuellar has not been charged with anything – but allowing an FBI raid weeks before his hotly contested 1 March primary suggests the highest levels of the justice department signed off on this action. Although he calls himself a moderate, Cuellar is a conservative Democrat who reflects a different era of Texas and US politics. Many progressive Democrats in Texas and beyond view that as seditious to the party, prompting a national progressive Democratic effort to purge him from office. This includes support from Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, as well as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, all of whom have endorsed Cuellar’s two-time challenger, Jessica Cisneros, who once interned for him. Cisneros, who came within four points of defeating Cuellar in 2020, has seen her fortunes dramatically increase this year thanks to the FBI. But there is concern that she might be too progressive for this border district, and a primary victory by her could bolster the chances of Republicans capturing that seat. I first met Cuellar in the 1990s when he had served in the Texas House of Representatives for nearly a decade. As the eldest of eight children to migrant farmworker parents, Cuellar pursued post-secondary education with vigour and has more degrees than most members of Congress. He earned an associate degree from Laredo Community College and then went to Georgetown University in Washington, DC for a bachelor’s degree before returning to Texas to get a master’s degree at Texas A&M International University in Laredo. He then secured a doctorate and law degree from the University of Texas at Austin. Along the way, he also secured a black belt in karate. Always gregarious and down-to-earth friendly, Cuellar had already developed the politician’s veneer and seemed to be running for office even while in law school, a classmate of his once told me. Few people know that one of the first major political forces in Texas to publicly call on then governor George W Bush to run for president was the powerful Democratic lieutenant governor Bob Bullock. Cuellar was in the state’s lower chamber when Bullock, the head of the upper chamber, made that endorsement. And Cuellar seems to have learned what made Bullock so effective and powerful as a statewide elected official – bipartisanship. When Bush finally won the White House and stepped down as Texas governor, Republican Rick Perry, who succeeded Bullock, was elevated to the state’s top office and appointed Cuellar secretary of state, the most visible appointment a Texas governor can make. It showed a spirit of bipartisanship that Texas lawmakers then boasted about in contrast to the bitter partisan divisions that had already beset Washington. But it also put a pall on Cuellar in the eyes of Democrats, many of whom lost trust in him. That sense of betrayal dissipated as Cuellar left state politics and won a seat in Congress in 2004 by a 58-vote margin against former friend and incumbent representative Ciro Rodriguez. In his 17 years in Congress, Cuellar has developed a reputation as either a politician who is wily enough to reach across the aisle or a vendido, Spanish for sellout. He has received several A grades from the National Rifle Association and opposes abortion rights. From my vantage point, his willingness to play well with Republicans and his ability to compromise has made Cuellar arguably the most effective and powerful of the 13 Texas Democrats in Congress. Nothing is more emblematic of the duelling opinions about Cuellar than the congressional battle over funding Trump’s border wall. As a member of the House appropriations committee and its subcommittee on homeland security, Cuellar was in the thick of the fight over border wall funding during the Trump administration. His congressional district is huge, extending from Laredo north-east to San Antonio and south to Mission in the Rio Grande Valley, where early plans for the border wall raised a lot of concerns. As the only member of Congress on the border to be part of a negotiating team to fund the wall, Cuellar was able to carve out significant exceptions to where the wall could be built. This included La Lomita Mission, located on the banks of the Rio Grande, which is the namesake for the city of Mission; the Santa Ana national wildlife refuge, which sits at the juncture of two major bird migratory routes and is the home of more than 400 bird species; the National Butterfly Centre, a 100-acre preserve; and even the launchpad for Elon Musk’s SpaceX – all of which were threatened by construction of a wall and adjacent security zone for US Border Patrol agents to drive. Then to the consternation of those who opposed the wall, Cuellar voted twice to fund construction for nearly 100 miles of wall in south Texas, the second vote helping to avert a government shutdown. Debate continues over whether Cuellar was able to save some of the most environmentally and historically sensitive property in south Texas or whether he sold out his constituents. His actions suggest he was acceding to political compromise, a traditional mainstay of the legislative process that is becoming more of a liability in our take-no-prisoners political landscape. The actions of the FBI, just weeks before the 14 February start of early voting in the Texas primary elections, suggest Cuellar’s political sacrifice is the new cost of business in Washington.

1/31/2022,"Plenty of people – on the left as well as the right – believed George Osborne when he conjured up a dystopian vision of Britain after a vote for Brexit during the final weeks of the referendum campaign. The then chancellor said victory for leave would result in a “DIY recession”, the loss of 800,000 jobs, a weaker housing market and a stock market crash. Two years on from our date of departure from the EU, none of it has happened. Unemployment is lower than it was in 2016 and, although this is very much a mixed blessing, house prices are higher. Share prices have risen and until Covid-19 arrived there was no recession. That hasn’t halted the flow of gloomy predictions: Nissan would quit the UK, tens of thousands of City jobs would be lost to Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam. More recently, Brexit supply chain problems would mean a turkey-less Christmas and empty high street shelves in December. None of that happened either, and the wait for economic meltdown goes on.  Far from quitting the UK, Nissan last year announced it was investing £1bn in electric vehicle production at its Sunderland plant. Children didn’t wake up to empty Christmas stockings. A study by the consultancy EY found almost nine out of 10 global financial services firms plan to establish or expand operations in the UK this year. Confirmation bias is where people latch on to evidence that suits their argument while zoning out things that don’t. Opponents of Brexit, for example, filter out the success of the UK’s go-it-alone vaccine procurement strategy and the freedom the government now has to cut VAT on domestic energy bills. Brexit supporters, by contrast, point out that UK exports to the EU in the second half of 2021 varied little from their level in the same period of 2020 when trade was still frictionless, but ignore the fact that other countries performed more strongly last year as lockdown restrictions were eased. Likewise, they downplay the loss of share trading to Amsterdam and the UK’s poor investment performance after the Brexit vote. Stripped of the social media spats, the reality is that Brexit has not magically transformed Britain’s economic prospects, but nor has it been calamitous. From a big-picture perspective, Britain’s economy will exit Covid-19 looking pretty much the same as when the virus first arrived two years ago, even though the UK left the single market and the customs union in the meantime. Unemployment is little different, interest rates are a little lower, the housing market is hot. The big difference is that inflation is a lot higher, as it is in every developed country. That’s not to say the transition from EU membership has been seamless or cost free. It has been a burden that small exporting businesses could have done without at any time, let alone when seeking to cope with the impact of a global pandemic. But the response to Covid-19 has proved two thing: businesses adapt to changed circumstances pretty quickly, and that process can be accelerated by supportive government policy. The models suggesting the damage from Brexit will be permanent rather than transitional are flawed for two reasons: they are based on a number of questionable – and often neoliberal – assumptions; and they envisage life goes on as before, with no change in behaviour either by the private sector or the state. There is a parallel here with the aim of “greening” the economy. Clearly, there will be costs from decarbonising the economy, but supporters of the net zero target think these can be mitigated by activist government, and see the opportunity to break with a broken model. There are those for whom this represents a false parallel because there can be no possible benefits from leaving the EU. For them it is only a matter of time before the doomsday scenario comes about, and therefore the only way ahead is for Britain to rejoin. But this strategy would only work if one of the two main parties supported it, and neither of them do. The most significant Brexit development of the past two years has not been economic but political: the decision by Keir Starmer to accept that the left needed to come up with its own plan for a post-EU Britain. Interviewed by my colleague Simon Hattenstone, Starmer could not have been clearer: “Look, we’ve left the EU. There’s no case for rejoining so we have to make it work. We are out, and we’re staying out.” Asked whether that ruled out a return to the single market or customs union under a Labour government he went on: “Yes, it does. We’ve got to make Brexit work from the outside and not reopen old wounds.” Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said the same when she recently outlined her five-point plan for the economy. For Labour, Brexit is a done deal, and accepting that has meant it has been Reeves, who supported remain in 2016, rather than Rishi Sunak, who backed leave, who has been making the case to cut VAT on energy bills. Labour’s new stance makes sense, and not just because it gives the party a chance of winning the next election. Until recently there were only two options: a wasted-opportunity Brexit where nothing much happens and the economy trundles along much as before; and a rightwing free-market Brexit. Now there’s a third: a Labour Brexit in which the state uses its new powers to build a greener, fairer, levelled-up Britain.

1/31/2022,"#family This whole time I’d been reading it wrong,seeing only broken things.In Orthopaedics, # is read as ‘fracture’ –#NoF is ‘fractured neck of femur’,#collarbone is ‘fractured collarbone’.  When I was young, my mother dabbeddalanghita oil onto her hands to soothea fissure in my chest – a finger sweptthe muscle between my ribs. The windowtrembled with fractures of lightningas frayed shadows swallowed the room.I focused on her touch and everythingeased into the fluster of leaves. But I woke to the clatter of her luggageto find her gone.Perhaps that is how every waking hour begins.Now I rub Vicks on my breastbone, hopingthe storm beneath will cease. I tread a dislocatedworld, and each spot I step onto cleaves. Romalyn Ante was born in Lipa, Batangas in the Philippines in 1989 and came to live in the UK at the age of 16. She has followed her mother’s profession as an NHS nurse, and she also works as a psychotherapist. Her prizewinning first collection, Antiemetic for Homesickness, was published in 2020 and is dedicated to her mother. Although Ante takes pleasure in the textures of language and uses Tagalog words and phrases to striking effect in many poems, #family suggests how a symbol might do some of the work of a word and even do it more simply, coolly, fluidly. The first stanza explains how the hash symbol is interpreted in orthopaedics, and gives examples. The terms “fracture” and “break” are used interchangeably in clinical practice, although there are degrees of severity, as explained here. If no displacement occurs, the fracture is less severe. As we glance back at the title from the “fractured neck of femur” and the “fractured collarbone” it seems we’re being asked to see “family” as fractured or broken. But the stanza contains a warning-to-self against “seeing only broken things”. Now a vivid childhood memory rises to the surface. The special oil used by the mother to treat her daughter’s wound is from the dalanghita, “a small fruit-bearing tree largely cultivated in Batangas”. The effect of the massage on the child and on the storm outside the window with its “fractures of lightning” is calming: “everything / eased into the fluster of leaves.” It’s as if the essence of the fruit had somehow shared this maternal soothing and healing with the tumult outside. Reassurance is shattered in the final stanza, with “the clatter” of the mother’s luggage and the inconsolable discovery of her absence. There’s tremendous bleakness in the suggestion, “Perhaps that is how every waking hour begins.” Somehow, now, the speaker takes over her own maternal tending. In the new country “Vicks” is the old-fashioned, comforting “folk” remedy. It’s not a certain salve in the poem, although the speaker places her hope in its power, like the dalanghita oil of childhood, to heal an internal storm. The poem doesn’t bring us to a place of comfort. “I tread a dislocated / world, and each spot I step onto cleaves.” The line-break emphasises the displacement, and the rhyme of “cleaves” with the “leaves” of the previous stanza further reinforces the devastating change. Not even the ground is trustworthy. If the poem has set up an internal argument against an idea of a complete fracture of family relations, it also expresses the more complex fact that it’s not only “things” or bones which can be broken. Romalyn Ante has recently been named as one of the winners of the 2021/2022 Jerwood Compton poetry fellowships, together with Dzifa Benson and Jamie Hale. Many congratulations to all three, and best wishes for their future projects and publications.",Arts/Books,Poem of the week: #family by Romalyn Ante,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2022/jan/31/poem-of-the-week-family-by-romalyn-ante
1/31/2022,"Nicholas Ashe Bateman’s ambitious debut breaks away from the recent crop of fantasy epics based on existing materials. A mass of tangled storylines spanning decades envelops Anmaere, a post-apocalyptic world containing two cities named Whithren and Levithen, both of which are in a perpetual state of stagnancy. The citizens of the sweltering Whithren dream of escaping to Levithen, a journey made possible only by earning a coveted ticket on one of the ferries that transport horses to the elusive, snow-capped land. Despite Withren’s industrial griminess, the sun once shone on this forsaken land. Memories of better days haunt the city’s inmates – even those who were born after the mysterious events that cast Anmaere into darkness, the details of which are never specified. And while The Wanting Mare is able to create spectacular visuals out of limited means – it was largely shot in a New Jersey warehouse – the weak script offers little of emotional substance, as it haphazardly jumps from one character to another. Barely any time is paid to the doomed romance between Moira (Ashleigh Nutt), an orphaned loner, and Lawrence (played by Bateman himself), a wounded thief, before the film fast-forwards to the former’s children, who are struggling to break free decades later.  New side characters are introduced and quickly discarded ahead of a reunion between the former lovers, which proves to be one of the film’s more coherent moments: they are actually allowed to speak at some length of lost dreams and regrets over the span of the third act. But in the end, The Wanting Mare is so invested in creating a dazzling atmosphere that it fails to grasp that, even in a world empty of hope, the interior life of its characters is still more interesting than visually impressive rubble and ruins.  The Wanting Mare is available on 7 February on digital platforms.",Arts/Film,The Wanting Mare review – tangled post-apocalyptic fantasy is all atmosphere,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/31/the-wanting-mare-review-post-apocalyptic-fantasy-nicholas-ashe-bateman
1/31/2022,"The Winston Machine is a typically probing and playful work from Kandinsky theatre, shot through with music and mischief. It’s about a young woman called Becky who dreams of the 1940s and the dashing wartime romance between her grandparents, while planning to buy a house in a town she does not like, with a boyfriend she does not love. It’s a rich production, which dances nimbly across the decades and explores how our links with the past can be a joyful and enriching thing – but painful, misleading and crushingly claustrophobic, too. Directed with head-rushing freedom by James Yeatman and with deft dramaturgy from Lauren Mooney, this show is also about communication. And noise. The scenes in the present are full of clamour: a cacophony of constant distraction. Becky’s boyfriend tries to get her to look at their house listing on the internet but, in one continuous line of speech (which Hamish MacDougall delivers with such skill and humour), he also vocalises everything else that Becky is looking at on her laptop screen: Instagram feeds, Facebook likes and, of course, pictures of cats.  The present might be closest to us, suggests Kandinsky, but with all that scrolling and clicking it can also feel very far away. What are the feelings and experiences, then, that help to keep us grounded? Music. Definitely music. Becky (Rachel-Leah Hosker) is a singer and the way she most easily accesses the past is through song. Vera Lynn. Summertime. Songs rise up through the cracks between the past and present and – with Hosker’s deep and beautifully centred voice – hold everything still. Nathaniel Christian, in a strikingly mature professional stage debut, plays the romance in Becky’s life. He is her pilot grandfather and he is also Lewis, an old friend and successful musician recently returned home from London. Christian spends a lot of time wearing a blue RAF jacket. The picture of a hero. But as the scenes fracture and deepen, that heroic image blurs. Becky’s grandfather wasn’t always a good person. Lewis’s career has barely even begun. It’s all just a matter of perspective.

1/31/2022,"An attempt to endorse three prominent sitting Morrison government MPs without the need for plebiscites has been rejected by warring factions of the NSW Liberal party, dramatically increasing the prospect of federal intervention. A motion sponsored by the prime minister’s office and sent to the 27-strong NSW state executive as a “fax ballot” has failed to pass.  It asked the state executive to bypass the preselection process in North Sydney, Farrer and Mitchell – effectively saving the careers of the moderate faction leader, Trent Zimmerman, the environment minister, Sussan Ley and the immigration minister, Alex Hawke. The vote required 90% support to pass but the motion was rejected by “double digits” of the state executive, one factional organiser said. By late Monday afternoon, there were attempts to withdraw the failed motion – a trigger for federal intervention – as desperate factional organisers tried to come up with another compromise acceptable to the state executive. The party failed to consider a comprehensive peace deal on Friday night at its regular meeting because of lack of support. Federal intervention in the state branch using special powers is similar to appointing an administrator and would almost certainly trigger legal action – which could see the party embroiled in court action as it seeks to fight four state byelections on 12 February and a federal election likely in May. One state executive member, Matthew Camenzeuli, has already written to the state director, Chris Stone, foreshadowing legal action if preselections do not proceed according to the rules. The result suggests there is now such a level of distrust between the factions that a deal will be hard to reach, despite the prime minister, Scott Morrison, taking a direct interest. “Some people voted on a point of principle and do not want to bypass democracy, some want to poke the PM in the eye,” said one observer. The crisis within the NSW Liberals has in part been triggered by new rules introduced in 2018 by the Warringah motion championed by former primer minister Tony Abbott. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The rules require plebiscites to be held in branches to choose the state and federal candidates. Branch members have 75 % of the votes with head office making up the other 25%. The ongoing uncertainty is taking a toll and will make it extremely difficult for the Liberals to run effective campaigns throwing seats into doubt. Two contentious seats – Dobell and Hughes – are still be to resolved, as are preselections for several others with vacancies including Warringah, Bennelong and Parramatta. Morrison’s preferred candidate for Dobell, Jemima Gleason, a pentecostal preacher, has withdrawn and another potential candidate – a well-known cricketer – has also cooled on the idea. That leaves just one candidate, Dr Michael Feneley, who is backed by the right faction. The proposal to springboard a former Young Liberal from Manly, Alex Dore, into Hughes has also angered local branches who have been denied the right to choose a candidate for the last three federal elections. The party did, however, on Monday endorse a number of uncontentious preselections, including Morrison himself for Cook, the energy minister, Angus Taylor, for Hume, the communications minister, Paul Fletcher, for Bradfield, Fiona Marton for Reid, Michael Cains in Whitlam and Wissam “Sam” Kayal in Werriwa. The last two must still pass the vetting process which has been held up for months. The NSW Senate ticket will go to a ballot, with the foreign minister, Marise Payne, in the No 1 spot, and two other sitting senators, Concetta Fierrvante-Wells and Jim Molan battling it out for the next winnable spot at No 3. The No 2 spot is filled by the Nationals. Dallas McInerney, one of the right faction conveners, is not nominating. Nominations close on Monday.

1/31/2022,"The anti-corruption campaigner Bill Browder has called on Britain to target Russian oligarchs close to president Vladimir Putin with economic sanctions to halt any invasion of Ukraine when new legislation is unveiled on Monday. The US-born financier believes the most effective means of getting the Russian president’s attention is to target his finances and the finances of those closest to him, and that there should be no need for the UK to wait and see if a war ensues.  “They should sanction five oligarchs tomorrow. That would show there is political will to do this. Then should sanction another five if they don’t pull back in the 10 days and the top 50 if they invade,” Browder told the Guardian. The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, is expected to unveil legislation on Monday to allow Britain to hit banks, energy companies and “oligarchs close to the Kremlin” with economic sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine. “There will be severe costs on an invasion into Ukraine. And we would target Russian financial institutions, we would target energy companies, we will target oligarchs close to the Kremlin,” Truss told the BBC on Sunday. Browder, who has campaigned for countries around the world to introduce Magnitsky legislation, allowing them to sanction individuals linked to human rights abuses or corruption, said there was “no need to wait” for an invasion. “From my experience, the only thing that Putin cares about is his money, which is held for him by oligarch trustees,” said Browder, who believes key Russian billionaires hold some of their wealth in trust for the Russian president. Putin, however, denies he is wealthy and official Kremlin disclosures show he has an income of about $140,000, plus three cars and a small apartment. Claims last year by the now-jailed campaigner Alexei Navalny that he owned a vast 17,691 sq metre palace on the Black Sea coast have also been officially rejected. The US president, Joe Biden, said last week he would consider personal sanctions against Putin if he orders an invasion of Ukraine – although it is not clear if the planned UK legislation will allow the president to be targeted. Foreign Office sources said Britain’s existing sanctions regime allowed the UK only to target those linked to the destabilisation of Ukraine; the new legislation will permit a wider targeting of the “strategic interests” of the Russian state. But Browder warned the UK would face “intense lobbying” by Russian oligarchs to ensure they are not personally sanctioned. “They will hire lobbyists and PR firms – and it will take strength and fortitude for the British government to deal with that,” he said. Bob Seely, a Conservative member of the foreign affairs select committee, said he welcomed Truss’s proposed legislation, but said it was “a decade too late”. He added: “We have needed a consistent and robust approach to Russia, across the tools of Russian state power, to act as a deterrence. We have not had it.” The Tories have been accused of allowing Kremlin-linked money to flow easily through the City of London, and several individuals with strong links to Russia have donated to the party. Last week, the Center for American Progress, a US thinktank close to President Biden, warned that “uprooting Kremlin-linked oligarchs will be a challenge given the close ties between Russian money and the United Kingdom’s ruling Conservative party, the press, and its real estate and financial industry”. The thinktank proposed creating a joint US-UK working group to “prod stronger action from the UK government”. When asked about the thinktank report, Truss told the BBC: “We are doing more. We are introducing new legislation.”",News/UK news,Anti-corruption campaigner calls on UK to target oligarchs close to Putin,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/31/anti-corruption-campaigner-bill-browder-uk-oligarchs-putin
