5/16/2022,"As a migrant of colour, still struggling with the Home Office to regularise my immigration status in the UK, and as a campaigner against the “hostile environment” policy and draconian border apparatus, I read with interest Holly Hudson’s piece on why Green New Deal Rising activists disrupted a Bassetlaw Conservatives dinner that Priti Patel, the home secretary, attended (Why we confronted Priti Patel about her inhumane ‘Rwanda plan’ at a Tory dinner, 9 May). In this age of more carceral border controls, it seems rather pedestrian for activists to think that disrupting a Tory dinner will make a difference, especially confronting someone with a far-right agenda such as Patel. I take issue that activists paid to attend this Tory dinner. Have they forgotten that disruptions should never financially feed the belly of the beast – that being the Tory party? Recently, the Edinburgh community stopped another immigration raid, just a week shy of the one-year anniversary of the “battle of Kenmure Street”. That is what solidarity should always look like. What is frustrating is how migrant activists are relegated and often forced to the back, unseen, while white activists – who are often British and middle class – are hypervisible and applauded for actions that are little more than media stunts. Precarious migrants do not need tame disruptions for a few media clicks. We want massive disruptions, with unions and grassroots groups working together to elevate migrant activist voices and make the hostile environment policy and the UK’s draconian borders inoperable.Katya Sharifi-NiaBrighton  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

5/16/2022,"George Monbiot (On a vegan planet Britain could feed 200 million people, 13 May) quotes me as calculating that “while a diet containing a moderate amount of meat, dairy and eggs would require the use of 11m hectares of land (4m of which would be arable), a vegan diet would demand a total of just 3m”. He doesn’t point out that these figures relate to chemical agriculture using artificial fertilisers and pesticides – practices that he later says he doesn’t support. I also made estimates for organic vegan agriculture with green manure being ploughed directly into the soil, and for organic husbandry in which green manure is fed to dairy cows whose manure is composted, while pigs and chickens are substantially fed on food waste. Both systems require about 6.5m hectares of arable land to provide a healthy diet for everyone in the country. The vegan system is slightly more efficient in its land use, while the livestock system provides a more varied diet. Given the rising cost of artificial fertilisers, the need to stop using the fossil fuels from which they are made, and declining insect populations, the organic option is looking increasingly attractive. Were it to come to pass, the remaining 11m or so hectares of grassland would be open to a variety of land uses, such as nature recovery, grazing cattle and sheep, planting more trees, energy crops and so on. My guess is that rather than choosing to rewild all of it, as Monbiot suggests, most people would prefer a diverse, multifaceted landscape supporting a thriving rural economy.Simon FairlieBridport, Dorset  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

5/16/2022,"Shivkumar Sharma, who has died aged 84, was one of the great innovators of Indian music, a virtuoso instrumentalist and composer who was known both for his Bollywood film music and for his classical work, and who succeeded in introducing a new instrument, the santoor, to Indian classical music. It was no easy task, for this is an ancient folk instrument, popular in Jammu and Kashmir, where Sharma grew up, which many musicians initially regarded as being unsuitable for playing classical styles. Traditionally used to accompany Sufi Islamic mystic songs, it is a hammered dulcimer shaped like a trapezoid box that has 100 strings and is struck with small mallets rather than plucked – making it very different to a sitar, sarod or other instruments previously used to play classical ragas, which require rapid-fire slides between notes. But Sharma persevered, became a celebrity in India by performing the santoor, and then brought his music to concert halls and festivals in Europe, Britain and the US. “My story is different from that of other classical musicians,” he explained in his memoir Journey With a Hundred Strings (written with Ina Puri, 2002). “While they have to prove their mettle, their talent, their calibre, I had to prove the worth of my instrument.” Born in Jammu, in a region famed for the beauty of its lakes and mountains, but bitterly contested between India and Pakistan, he grew up listening to folk songs and the santoor-playing of his father, Uma Datt Sharma, a singer and multi-instrumentalist who had attempted to introduce the instrument to classical music – and wanted his son to continue his campaign. He taught Shivkumar to sing and play tabla drums, and when the boy was 13, began to teach him santoor. By the time he was 17 he was playing both tabla and santoor on the local radio station, and gave his first concert – controversially with the santoor – in what was then Bombay. Following a degree in economics at Jammu and Kashmir University, he moved to the city to work as a professional musician. It was not easy. “I remember going round looking for work,” he said. “and there were days when I had nothing to eat. I would play tabla and accompany other people, but concerts were hard to come by because of negative criticism of the santoor.” But he refused to switch to a different instrument and said: “I am stubborn to a certain extent. Once I make up my mind to do something I just do it.” In order to make money he started working in the film industry, arguing, “Composing music for films is not as easy as some classical musicians think. One has to think of the situation and the mood, while at a concert you generally play what you want to play.” He played santoor on the 1955 Hindi-language dance film Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje – the first time the instrument had featured in Indian cinema – in which it was heard alongside songs by the famous playback singer Lata Mangeshkar. He played tabla on a Bollywood film for the last time on Guide (1965), after being persuaded to do so by the “King of Bollywood Music”, RD Burman. Sharma was determined to concentrate on the santoor, and made modifications to the instrument to extend its range to three octaves and “create a smoother glissando to allow the player to sustain and slide between notes in perfect emulation of the human voice”. In 1967 he teamed up with the flautist Hariprasad Chaurasia and slide guitarist Brij Bhusan Kabra to record Call of the Valley, an instrumental piece that used ragas to tell the story of a day in the life of a Kashmiri shepherd. This was a “light-classical” mood piece that appealed to both Indian and young western audiences, at a time when the Beatles had become fascinated by India and Ravi Shankar had played at the Monterey pop festival in California. The album became a bestseller with a cult following – it even featured in the 2005 UK book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. By now in their early 30s, Sharma and his colleagues became celebrities, and the santoor was gaining recognition as a classical instrument. He continued to straddle classical and Bollywood styles, and continued his association with Chaurasia. The duo became known as Shiv-Hari, and their work included the music for a series of films for the celebrated Bollywood director Yash Chopra. Chopra was considered to have been taking a gamble by signing classical musicians, but it paid off, with the success of Silsilia (1981), Faasle (1985), Lamhe (1991) and the psychological thriller Darr (1993). Sharma then decided to quit film work, complaining that film directors now wanted “western beats and more noise than melody”. But he and Chaurasia continued to play live shows together. In 1966 he had married Manorama, in what he said was “an arranged marriage – we had seen each other just once”. The couple had two sons, the youngest of whom, Rahul, born in 1972, also became a distinguished santoor player, taught by his father, whom he often accompanied on stage. In 1997 they undertook a lengthy tour of the US together and the following year appeared at the Womad festival, then held in Reading. While in Britain they recorded an album for Real World Records, Sampradya (1999), which consisted of one lengthy new composition, Raga Janasammohini, and was produced by John Leckie, then best known for his work with the Fall and Radiohead. Leckie said: “He was a gentleman. There was no question of ‘Who are you? You’re a rock’n’roll producer.’” And as for his playing, and his ability to create micro-tones on a santoor, “he’d draw the little hammers across the strings and create a kind of harmonic between the two notes he was playing”. Sharma returned to Brtiain to play at the Darbar festival in London in 2010, in 2015 (when he also toured the UK), the following year at a tribute concert for Ravi Shankar, whom he had accompanied on tabla early in his career, with Chaurasia, and in 2019. He recorded dozens of albums and continued performing, even while receiving dialysis treatment for kidney problems. Looking back at his career, he said that his problems in getting the santoor to the classical stage were nothing when compared to the meditative trance that the music offered him. He is survived by Manorama and his sons, Rahul and Rohit.

5/16/2022,"Zimbabwe has denied harbouring Rwandan genocide fugitive Protais Mpiranya after it emerged that he died in 2006 and was buried in the country after living there for four years. The 20-year manhunt for one of the world’s most brutal killers came to a decisive end in an overgrown cemetery outside Harare, but Zimbabwean authorities say they did not conceal his whereabouts. “As a law abiding nation, Zimbabwe will never harbour criminals and welcomes findings from the DNA samples extracted from the fugitive,” foreign affairs minister, Frederick Shava, said in a statement on Sunday. He added that the government of Zimbabwe cooperated with UN investigators into Mpiranya’s case. “The government of Zimbabwe wishes to clarify some recent media reports that are circulating insinuating that the government was harbouring the most wanted Rwandese fugitive, Protais Mpiranya, whose remains were allegedly found in Zimbabwe under the alias Ndume Sambao,” the statement read. The body of Mpiranya, a former commander of the Rwandan presidential guard indicted for genocide, lay buried under a stone slab bearing a false name, which UN investigators tracked down and identified with the help of a lead found on a confiscated computer – the hand-drawn design for Mpiranya’s tombstone. His remains were exhumed last month at the request of UN investigators, and his identity was confirmed by DNA analysis on Tuesday. Zimbabwean authorities insist that they cooperated with the investigation by the organisation charged with tracking down fugitive criminals, the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals (IRMCT), adding that Zimbabwe joined a taskforce to coordinate the inquiry. “From day one, Zimbabwe cooperated fully with the investigation team,” the statement read. “The Zimbabwean authorities have consistently cooperated and adhered to the country’s international legal obligations.” Authorities in Harare said they were involved in the exhumation of Mpiranya’s remains and authorised DNA samples to confirm his identity. However, the government’s claim will raise some eyebrows among those who have followed the search. Investigators have long suspected the fugitive of hiding in Zimbabwe and have made repeated attempts to persuade local authorities to hand over Mpiranya, investigate his activities or provide evidence of his death. As early as December 2010, investigators reported to the UN security council that Mpiranya had connections with Zimbabwe and had lived there for long periods.In 2012, under pressure from Kigali, Zimbabwean authorities admitted that the fugitive could be on their territory and pledged to find him “dead or alive”. The question of his presence in Zimbabwe was discussed in parliament, and local media listed possible aliases and addresses associated with him. Officials from the IRMCT travelled to Zimbabwe months after President Robert Mugabe was forced from power in November 2017 in the hope that the new government would prove more helpful.However, in 2020 Serge Brammertz, prosecutor of the IRMCT, told the security council that despite credible evidence of the whereabouts of key fugitives, the lack of cooperation from governments remained a challenge, particularly in east and southern Africa. According to the IRMCT, Mpiranya fled to Zimbabwe in 2002, where his entry was facilitated by local officials. He then brought associates and family to Zimbabwe, along with a series of “trusted subordinates”. For four years, Mpiranya was able to avoid arrest in Zimbabwe, where he resided in an affluent area of Harare, and “continued his engagement with Zimbabwean military officials” while also receiving a series of visitors from overseas.",News/World news,Zimbabwe denies harbouring deceased Rwandan genocide fugitive,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/15/zimbabwe-denies-harbouring-protais-mpiranya-deceased-rwandan-genocide-fugitive
5/16/2022,"Labour activists in Durham have called on a Conservative MP to withdraw allegations made to the police, accusing him of presenting misleading evidence about Keir Starmer. The move was backed by the dean of Durham University’s law school, Prof Thom Brooks, who said the evidence provided by the Conservative MP Richard Holden in a letter to Durham constabulary appeared to have been proven incorrect. The chair of the City of Durham Labour party, Sheila Williams, said the allegations were “wasting police time”, including referring to a quiz and social event as being in-person when there was reference to a Zoom link. Police are investigating claims that the Labour leader broke Covid-19 rules at a gathering of staff at Durham Miners’ Hall during an election campaign in April last year, where a takeaway was ordered and Starmer was filmed drinking a beer. Labour has claimed the food was necessary for staff who were eating while they worked, and has compiled evidence for police that work continued until later that night. However, at least one witness has told the Guardian they are certain Starmer himself did not continue working in the hall after finishing the takeaway curry. The investigation by Durham constabulary will hinge on whether the gathering of campaign aides and staffers from the local MP’s office was necessary for work. Starmer has said he will resign if he receives a fine. Holden has been a key figure in highlighting apparent inconsistencies in Starmer’s version of events around so-called Beergate. The Tory MP previously published one letter he sent to Durham constabulary, in which he claimed to have two new pieces of evidence for them to investigate. The first was a Facebook invitation to a quiz and social on the night Starmer was filmed, which Holden said “clearly shows” a gathering was intended to take place. The other was a Facebook message from the Labour MP for City of Durham, Mary Foy, who encouraged members to have a “greasy night”, which Holden said was a slang term for drinking too much. He said that it “appears to link the event to images of Keir Starmer drinking beer on the evening in question”. He said the messages suggest “a pre-planned in-person social event … attended by the leader of the opposition”. However, in a furious letter to the Tory MP, Williams, the chair of City of Durham Labour party, said members were being unfairly maligned and police provided with misleading information. Williams said “greasy” was “clearly a typographical error” where Foy had meant to type “great” and that the spelling error was pointed out on the Facebook post itself. She said the invitation to the quiz and social also made it clear a Zoom link would follow. “You have accused me as chair … and other officers of party of wilfully and purposefully conspiring to breach the Covid lockdown regulations that existed at that time. You, by implication, have accused all our members who attended that event of breaking the law,” she wrote. “If you had carried out even the most basic investigations, you would have discovered that you were wasting police time by asking them to investigate whether or not Keir Starmer attended the event … You brazenly did this knowing you had no evidence to prove your assertion to the chief constable.” Williams demanded a “full and unequivocal apology” from Holden and said he should tell the police that his report was “based on conjecture”. Brooks, the Durham University law professor, said: “The ‘new’ evidence of a possible breach is nothing of the sort. It concerns an online event held within the rules and raises no questions to answer. I expect the police will find no merit in these allegations when their investigation concludes.” Brooks, who has previously campaigned for the Labour party, said he did not believe Durham constabulary would find that Starmer had broken the rules. “It was no breach of lockdown rules at that time to host an online event as described. Nor is it a breach of lockdown rules at that time for those working together during an election campaign to have a meal,” he said. Holden said Durham police themselves said they had received “significant new evidence” about the Labour leader’s movements that evening. He added that there had been a number of inaccuracies in Labour’s own version, including the presence of the party’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner. “It’s vital that important questions are answered too, after clear inaccuracies – such as who and the number of people present and the nature of the gathering – were made by the Labour party and Labour leader at earlier points,” he said. “Fundamentally, it is vital that the words and actions of the leader of the opposition receive the same scrutiny and inquiry as the actions of those he has spent the best part of a year focusing his efforts on have received. Given there is now an ongoing police investigation, I think it is now vital that the police are allowed to get on with their important work.”",News/Politics,Labour activists call on Tory MP to withdraw Beergate allegations,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/15/labour-keir-starmer-tory-mp-richard-holden-beergate-allegations

5/16/2022,"As a lifelong republican and a thorn in the side of the establishment, I was gobsmacked to receive a letter from the organisers of the Queen’s platinum jubilee pageant inviting me to join the finale on 5 June outside Buckingham Palace, as one of a select group of “National Treasures … celebrated, respected and admired people”. What, me? Surely some mistake. As a supporter of the campaign group Republic, I’ve urged the abolition of the monarchy and its replacement by a democratically elected head of state. For decades, I’ve championed a fair deal for everyone, against the elitism and privilege epitomised by royalty. To be fair, the invitation was gracious. But I’m mindful that the establishment uses flattery and honours to disarm critics and radicals, and suck them into the system. I declined the invitation. I do not wish to participate in a pageant that celebrates a monarchical regime based on hierarchy, deference and inherited wealth, status and power. It is a leftover from feudalism that defies modern aspirations for democracy, egalitarianism and meritocracy. The royals are steeped in a history of war, colonialism and slavery. The crown estate derives much of its assets – including properties and some of the crown jewels – from past royal conquest and exploitation. The true scale of the Queen’s private wealth has never been disclosed, though it has been estimated to run into the hundreds of millions of pounds. The royal household employs 1,133 people, and despite commitments to pay the living wage, a recent report by Insider identified that from 503 jobs advertised between 2015 and 2021, 10 were below the living wage and 274 positions paid just pennies above that rate. In lieu of good wages, they are supposed to feel honoured to work for the monarchy. The Queen has led an exceedingly cosseted, privileged life. She has never known deprivation, never made sacrifices or risked anything, unless you count the danger of a horse-riding accident. According to the elitist values of the monarchical order, we are “subjects” of Her Majesty, under her dominion. To add insult to injury, the most stupid, immoral royal is, by virtue of the family into which they are born, deemed more fit to be our head of state than the wisest, most ethical commoner. That’s just plain wrong – and offensive. The organisers are portraying the platinum jubilee as a celebration of the Queen’s reign. But it is also a gigantic public relations exercise and, some say, propaganda for the monarchy; intended to win public hearts and minds for the continuation of the royal regime. In truth, the Queen is head of a flawed institution that is out of step with liberal, multicultural Britain. The monarch is head of state and this highest public office is restricted to the first born in the royal line of succession. This means that for the foreseeable future, no Black or Asian Briton, no matter how worthy, can be our head of state. Isn’t that a tad racist? While I doubt that the Queen is a raging homophobe, she doesn’t appear to be gay friendly. As far as I know, the words lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender have never publicly passed the her lips since she ascended the throne in 1952. Defenders of the monarchy point out that many royal staff are gay men. So what? Having gay staff wait hand and foot on the Queen is proof of nothing, apart from the fact that she likes well mannered, well groomed male servants. In 2014, the Queen congratulated London Lesbian & Gay Switchboard on its 40th anniversary. However, the letter was a standard congratulation and the quoted wording did not mention the LGBT+ work that the switchboard does. Indeed, the Queen has never been a patron of any LGBT+ charity, despite being patron of more than 600 organisations. After the 1999 Soho gay pub bombing, which killed three people and injured more than 70 others, she did not visit the bomb scene or the victims in hospital, forfeiting an opportunity to show she cares about the lives of LGBT+ people. To be ignored for seven decades feels like a deliberate snub. I have written to the Queen and her press office about these failings but received no reply or only a pro forma acknowledgment. From one human being to another, I wish the Queen well. But I cannot join the celebration of her reign.

5/16/2022,"The 140-mile journey that Igor Pedin, 61, embarked upon by foot from the hellscape of the besieged port city of Mariupol, through Russian occupied lands in the south-east of Ukraine and on to the relative safety of the city of Zaporizhzhia, has left him tired, sometimes tearful, and always thankful. As the Guardian reported last week, Pedin’s feat was so extraordinary that at one of the 24 checkpoints he passed during his travels on the long journey, equivalent to trekking from London to Sheffield but through a raging war, Russian soldiers had gathered around him in the dark of the night to hear of his daring deeds, stuffing cigarettes in his pockets, and wishing him luck. But, while Pedin says he does not require medical assistance, insisting to medics when he arrived in Zaporizhzhia that he was “happy as I am – alive”, the former ship’s cook says he is increasingly concerned for his loyal partner on their epic walk, Zhu-Zhu, his nine-year-old mongrel terrier. Now in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, Zhu-Zhu is still fearful of the whistle of a braking bus, reminiscent as it is of the bombs of Mariupol, and he sleeps long into the day. His sense of smell, damaged by the acrid smoke of burning homes and tanks, is slowly returning, and he buries his nose into the grasses of Kyiv’s parks, with some apparent satisfaction. But Pedin says his dog’s paws were badly cut up by the walk across smashed glass, cratered roads, and the rusty frame of a burned out and broken 30m-high bridge that the two had to traverse during their terrifying adventure. Zhu-Zhu walks with a limp now, and Pedin worries that his dog appears to be getting physically weaker by the day. He hopes to find a vet who will help but with little money to his name, and relying on his parents Georgy, 87, and Yevdokiya, 84, for the shelter that he has, Pedin admits it is only a hope for now. “She is lame on the front right leg and she doesn’t let me see what’s wrong with her leg,” Pedin says of his dog. “She always nips me when I want to look at her paw … Zhu-Zhu now reacts very badly to sounds. When she hears sharp sounds, she constantly shudders and jumps aside. “She is very frightened by the sound of whistling. For example, when a bus passes by and the brakes squeak. She is very afraid of that because this sound reminds her of the whistling of bombs that flew and exploded then in Mariupol. And then she was afraid of the sound of military planes in Mariupol. Who flew and dropped bombs. So she is still afraid of these sounds.” Pedin’s tenderness towards his dog is evident. He caresses her ears, stroking off stray pieces of dry grass. The small dog, in turn, whimpers and cries when his owner is out of sight. Pedin had carried her up hills on their walk, remonstrating only once when Zhu-Zhu would not go any further. “If you don’t walk we will both die, you have to walk,” he had told his dog on one of the final days of their trek. “On the third day of the walk, Zhu-Zhu was very tired,” he recalls. “She periodically sat down, rested and often licked her sore paws.” But, the runt of a litter of 12 born in 2013, Pedin says his dog has been a loyal companion, giving him constant pleasure and love. He is determined to get the best care for her. “I can’t imagine my life without her,” he says. “Before the evacuation, I promised her to bring her alive out of Mariupol and to get to our final destination. I told her in our house before we left, ‘Just go and sing [like a marching soldier]’, and she walked to the door. “I promised she would be with me until the end, I promised.”",News/World news,Ukrainian who walked 140 miles to safety fears for his canine companion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/15/ukrainian-who-walked-140-miles-to-safety-fears-for-his-canine-companion
5/16/2022,"As a marine archaeologist, Mensun Bound headed the 2022 Antarctic expedition that discovered the wreck of Sir Ernest Shackleton’s Endurance, more than a century after the legendary ship became trapped in ice and sank. Now he is warning that its protection cannot be guaranteed due to the combined threats of global heating and underwater robotic technology that could enable thefts from the historic site. He fears that ocean acidification and melting ice will take their toll on Endurance, with underwater robotic systems becoming so advanced that he can envisage them being programmed from afar to travel “invisibly” beneath the ice of the Weddell Sea, where the Endurance lies at depth. Shackleton’s vessel was discovered in March, making Polar history in solving one of the great maritime mysteries. It is in such an astonishing state of preservation that iconic details such as its bell and rudder can be seen clearly. But Bound fears for their survival: “What if an observation class submersible had a manipulating arm tucked away beneath its bonnet? Would they be able to resist snatching the bell?” His warnings are sounded in an interview in the latest issue of Wreckwatch magazine, which focuses this month on Ice wrecks. Bound, director of exploration on the Endurance22 project for the Falklands Maritime Heritage trust, also headed the 2019 search, which was called off after an underwater vehicle became trapped beneath the ice. In Wreckwatch, he compares the environmental conditions on both expeditions, shocked by a dramatic deterioration: “There was very little of the old, thick, gnarled, multi-year ice and there was hardly any of the muscularity or pressure experienced in 2019. This time it was mainly thin first-year ice, and we were never under serious threat of becoming ice-bound. Was this an aberration peculiar to 2022 or part of a trend?… If the trend continues, we won’t be able to depend much longer on that hard carapace of perennial sea ice to protect the Endurance.” He adds: “There’s always been environmental change of one kind or another, but taking place over many thousands of years. What we’re seeing now has all happened within my lifetime which, in the scheme of things, is no more than the flick of a penguin’s tail. Although it looks serene and beautiful, Antarctica is a continent in pain; it’s a continent poised for catastrophe.” Bound describes the 2022 expedition as a “non-disturbance survey”. “We took nothing, we touched nothing … We were profoundly aware that what we had found was totemic, a ‘monument’ that has entered the very bloodstream of our nation.” Asked about wrecks that are often pillaged once found, he adds: “Illegal incursion by rogue organisations worries me a lot. I worked through what is often described as the Golden Age of maritime archaeology … The recent past doesn’t always feel so ‘golden’ … one long fight against vandals, a race against time to save what I could before another wreck was looted out of existence.” Sean Kingsley, a marine archaeologist and Wreckwatch’s editor, said: “Mensun’s global warming take is very powerful and timely.

5/16/2022,"Vigils were held across Buffalo, New York, for the victims of the Tops Friendly shooting Sunday, as Black residents on the city’s East Side mourned and attempted to come to terms with the brief, brutal event that had been visited on the neighborhood hours earlier. The square where the shooting took placed, surrounded by vacant lots that residents said were the result of decades of segregation and systemic racism, is the community’s center, with Tops Friendly functioning as the only grocery store for the immediate area. In striking Tops Friendly, the shooter – an 18-year-old self-confessed white supremacist – was not just hitting at a supermarket, but also a place where locals gathered as a community. “No weapons formed against me shall prosper,” said Karen Davis-Butler, a nurse and mother of three, who had tears streaming down her face. “It means that’s formed against us God is going to make sure it doesn’t hurt us. But we weren’t covered yesterday and the guy wasn’t covered. And I feel bad for him too.” Despite the horrors wrought on the neighborhood by the 18-year-old white shooter, Davis-Butler said others were to blame too for filling him with hate. “He’s only 18. Damn nearly grown. Where did he learn all of this stuff from? Who pushed this into his head? Where was his parents when he was looking at this stuff on the internet? This is like a gang thing with them, but it’s white supremacy and racism, and it’s taught. You’re not born hating Black people.” Davis-Butler said she was in Family Dollar next to the supermarket when the shooting began. “We saw everybody running, and they told us to stay in the store. It was crazy.” “This is where Juneteenth started, where our community used to thrive. We have a food desert here, and that’s racism, too. If you go on the other side of the city you see grocery store after grocery store. The racism here is all day everyday.” To Maurice Burse, another resident, the journey that the shooter allegedly made from his home in Conklin, near Binghamton 200 miles south, meant that he past other upstate New York cities, like Rochester and Syracuse. “It was by design, he knew what he was doing and that’s so sad. We’ve got sick people here, and some people would like nothing more than to have a race war and they’ll do anything to try to cause it. People really need to wake up,” Burse said. The neighborhood, Burse said, had begun to come back from the blight of previous decades. “But to get up in the morning and see all of this …hmmm, it’s bad,” he said waving to the encampments of police and media trucks that had suddenly sprouted in the strong May sun. “Its bad enough what goes on in the area already.” Twins Shameka and Tasheka Walker were standing on the corner of Riley and Jefferson, surveying the scene. “He was telling them on livestream what he was going to do. But they probably took it as joke,” said Tasheka. But a joke it was not – the shooter had reportedly posted missives about the great replacement theory, the ideological underpinning of many racist mass shootings, including in Norway and New Zealand. “They’re probably saying we’re having too many Black children but the community here is made up of all different races. The community here is like family, and Tops is always helpful, so how he had the audacity to come here and do this,” said Shameka. “What made you drive all this way and hit this. Why?” An analysis from the University of Michigan, based on data from the 2010 census, found that the Buffalo-Niagara Falls metro area is the sixth most Black-White segregated in the nation. A University of Buffalo report in 2021 found that living conditions for Black residents in Buffalo had improved little and in some cases had declined over the preceding 30 years. Local activist and chef Brandon Moses-Bonner, 26, said the problem is “everybody who is not addressing racism white supremacy” – an issue he believed had shaped his generation. “These young guys get radicalized by the internet, by Q-Anon, by white supremacists, who seek out them because they feel like victims. Nobody wants to address the problem because they’re afraid of hurting their feelings because they think saying racism is bad is indoctrination. But it’s not – it’s basic human decency.” Speaking to Face the Nation on Sunday morning, Buffalo mayor Byron Brown said the community had been experiencing fresh development and vowed that the awful event would not stop that happening. “People have been hoping and waiting for investment and growth and opportunity. We are beginning to see that in this community, in all parts of the city, and we won’t let that progress stop. We won’t let hateful ideology stop the progress that we are seeing and experiencing in the city of Buffalo.”",News/US news,‘It was by design’: Black residents try to come to terms with horror of shooting,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/15/buffalo-shooting-black-residents-react
5/16/2022,"There is a moment a few episodes into Conversations With Friends (BBC Three), the adaptation of Sally Rooney’s debut novel, when it seems as if the makers are deliberately trolling viewers. One of the characters is an actor and is asked what he’s doing at the moment. He’s starring in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof – “It’s a proper play,” he says, “where stuff happens.” Conversations With Friends is almost aggressively the opposite. I like a mood piece as much as the next person, but to stretch one out across a dozen episodes is to test the boundaries of even the most willing soul. Rooney’s adaptation, with Alice Birch, of her novel Normal People was a lockdown hit in 2020 for its rich, warm and well-observed tale of young love, sensitively directed by Lenny Abrahamson and Hettie Macdonald. Now Birch, writing alone this time, and Abrahamson (directing seven episodes, and Leanne Welham the other five) have reunited. You can imagine it was intimidating – the epitome of the difficult second album predicament after the raging success of their first collaboration – and it is hard to avoid a creeping sense that they have found themselves paralysed by their own success. Cool, confident Bobbi (Sasha Lane) and Frances (newcomer Alison Oliver), whose attempts at cynical poses only highlight her naivety, are best friends who dated at school and have just graduated. They’re also duetting performance poets, but they’re young and we all make mistakes. They are taken into the adult world of glamorous writer Melissa (Jemima Kirke) and thereby introduced to her handsome husband, Nick (Joe Alwyn). Bobbi and Melissa are entranced by each other’s fabulousness, while their more introverted partners inevitably (to anyone over the age of, say, 28?) begin a quiet affair. Non-groundbreaking consequences ensue. Slowly. Very, very slowly. Normal People kept the unselfconscious hyper-articulacy and self-analysis of the book’s characters, which made them grating at times but also made them real. They were Rooney’s psychological portraits made flesh. Here, the minutely detailed interior and exterior monologues in which she specialises have been jettisoned. Gone is the sense of the shifting sands of personal identity, the passion that can be poured into friendship, the time and energy expended on trivia that powered the book. Instead of a wealth of detail – albeit ironised by characters trying to shield themselves from harm or true feelings as the web of secrets grows – we get lots of meaningful looks, covert glances or charged/pained/strained silences, and very little in between to guide us. When everything is evoked, nothing is. Such great gaps make a nonsense of the script, even when the lines themselves are good. When Frances balks at Bobbi telling her she has a shiny face, Bobbi hastens to reassure her. “In a good way – it makes you seem less complicated.” This would be the perfect witty encapsulation of a profound friendship if we’d had any evidence beforehand that Frances is more complicated than any other 21-year-old walking through Dublin that day. There are meatier moments, glimpses of what might have been if the filleting knife had not been wielded so brutally. In episode three, Frances cries after having sex with Nick for the first time. “It’s not real crying, I promise,” she says. “Bobbi says it’s a symptom of my repressed nature. It’s just a physical thing, I feel great. Thank you.” True and not true, honesty and obfuscation, a thousand uncertainties dancing on the head of a pin – it’s the distilled essence of the agony of youth. It makes you want to pay a million pounds to be back there, and at the same time another million to make sure you never have to go anywhere near it again. The actors all turn in fine performances, making the most of what they have been given. Alwyn does well to handle the double burden of playing a strong, silent type who also turns out to be more decent than we expect. Silent goodness is nice for Nick’s wife and girlfriend, but it’s hard to make register on screen. The debuting Oliver probably won’t be catapulted to fame like Paul Mescal – this series is unlikely to capture the public imagination in the same way – but her ability to make ordinariness interesting and watchfulness intriguing bodes well for her career. Someone cast her in a play where something happens. Or at least where something’s said.",Arts/Television & radio,Conversations With Friends review – TV so slow it must be trolling us,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/15/conversations-with-friends-review-sally-rooney-tv-adaptation
5/16/2022,"Europe doesn’t hate the UK after all, it was just waiting for a decent song. This is what seasoned Eurovision watchers concluded after seeing Sam Ryder take a triumphant second place on Saturday night. It was a runner’s up slot that felt like a victory, given it had been widely expected that Ukraine would and – in the wider scheme of things – should win the contest. After a long, emotional evening in Turin, Kalush Orchestra won for Ukraine with their anthemic folk/hip-hop song Stefania. The band members had received special permission to leave the country and will be back involved in the war effort in two days. The victory led to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy defiantly promising that the contest would “one day” be held in Mariupol. It was a remarkable and important moment. The next question, certainly for British fans, was who would come second? And given the UK’s dismal recent record – including nul points last year – how low would its vote be this year? Instead Ryder and his song Space Man came a glorious second with 466 points. “It puts the argument firmly to bed that the UK hasn’t won because of Brexit or because of what Europe thinks of us,” said the TV critic and Eurovision pundit Scott Bryan. “It has been down to the fact that our entry was not interesting or good enough.” He added: “The song was fantastic but just as importantly the performance was fantastic … it was a real thrill to watch.” Ryder is the UK’s biggest success since Imaani was runner-up to Israel’s Dana International in 1998. In the intervening years UK fans have watched a succession of flops, including Engelbert Humperdinck finishing 25th of 26, Electro Velvet 24th and, for the last two contests, a national pride-piercing last place. The repeated failure is down, people have said over and again, to countries voting for their friends and allies and the UK never being one of them. That was rubbish, the BBC’s Eurovision host Graham Norton said after the contest on Saturday. “All those people wanging on about Europe hates us. I kept saying: ‘No … it is possible that with the right song, the right performer in the right year.’ We can do it and we did.” Bryan said the problem for the UK in recent years had been an assumption that the entry should be “Eurovision-ey”. “It has to be a particular sound, rather than an artist or a song who could be a big-selling artist in their own right, he said. “Someone was telling me that Sam Ryder’s song was played this morning on Capital Radio. That sounds an odd thing to say, but Capital Radio don’t play Eurovision entries.” Ryder was already a star, in that he is the most popular British musician on TikTok, thanks to his home-recorded versions of songs by everyone from Adele to Justin Hawkins to Michael Jackson. His performance of I Ain’t Got You led Alicia Keys to remark: “Yo. He killed this. This is hard for me to sing.” TikTok has given him 12.6 million followers, which helps. But what really mattered on Saturday, said Bryan, was the strength and the memorability of the song, co-written with the Ed Sheeran collaborator Amy Wadge. And the brilliance of the live performance. “Plus the order we appeared, only a couple from the end, that helped us stand out,” he added. The contest was watched by a global audience of 183 million people and in the UK by an average of 8.9 million, peaking at 10.6 million. Last year’s “nul points” viewing figure was 7.4 million. It was, said experts, a very strong contest, with even the stranger entries – Subwoolfer’s Give That Wolf a Banana for Norway – having something about them. Ryder said afterwards that his performance was all “about the love of singing, the joy it brings you”. The whole team had positivity, he said. “Being in that arena and witnessing this tangible energy of life, was incredible.” He predicted that next year the UK would go one better, telling Radio 4’s Broadcasting House: “Next year, it’s going to be mad. I can’t wait to see it … I hope with all my heart that the plethora of talent, the diverse pool of talent that exists in the UK, is going to bust down doors to be part of Eurovision next year.”",Arts/Television & radio,‘A thrill to watch’: how Sam Ryder turned UK’s Eurovision fortunes around,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/15/eurovision-2022-sam-ryder-uk
5/16/2022,"The use of Pegasus spyware to target both Catalan independence leaders and Spanish politicians – including the prime minister – has plunged Spain into a “crisis of democracy” and national security that can only be tackled with an independent investigation, a leading cybersecurity expert has warned. Last month, researchers at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab revealed that at least 65 individuals connected with the Catalan independence movement had been targeted with spyware between 2017 and 2020. A fortnight later, the Spanish government announced that the phones of the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, and the defence minister, Margarita Robles, had been hacked with Pegasus in May and June last year. Although the Spanish government attempted to defuse the row by sacking the country’s spy chief, Paz Esteban, earlier this week, the twin scandal is refusing to fade away. Ron Deibert, the director of the Citizen Lab, said he had been shocked to discover Pegasus being used against political targets and their families as well as against lawyers and journalists in what was meant to be “an ostensibly democratic” society. According to its makers, the Israeli NSO Group, the spyware is sold only to governments to help them track criminals and terrorists. Deibert told the Guardian that firing Esteban did not come close to addressing the disturbing questions raised by recent revelations. “Removing the intelligence chief looks to me like putting someone forward as a sacrificial lamb,” he said. “And it doesn’t answer any of the questions of who purchased the spyware, who authorised it, how was the justification given to go after people who are clearly not legitimate targets by any reasonable international standard, and involving gross violations of privacy rights. If the intent is to make this move and hope that the issue goes away, I think that’s inadequate.” The Citizen Lab chief said last month’s report underscored the urgent need for the setting up of an independent commission that had the authority to investigate what had happened and to suggest reforms to prevent it from happening again. “I think that’s even more necessary now in light of the dramatic findings that the prime minister and the defence minister’s own phones were hacked with Pegasus,” said Deibert. “What’s going on? If I was a Spanish citizen, I would be demanding that there be such an impartial inquiry. But it seems like that’s maybe not going to happen.” A fortnight ago, Sánchez’s Spanish Socialist Workers’ party (PSOE) joined the three parties on the Spanish right in vetoing a parliamentary inquiry into the Pegasus scandal. A PSOE spokesperson said the mooted congressional committee was not needed as an internal investigation by Spain’s national intelligence centre was already underway, as was an inquiry by the public ombudsman. Deibert, who was in Spain this week, said he had been surprised by the complacency he had encountered and disappointed that many people in the country appeared to have no problem with the targeting of the Catalan leaders. For many in Spain, the regional independence movement – which attempted a unilateral, illegal bid to secede in October 2017 – remains a direct challenge to the “indissoluble unity” of the country that is enshrined in the constitution. For Deibert, however, the issue transcends national politics. “I’ve been telling people that if they draw the conclusion that this is a Catalan issue and they can maybe dismiss it as such, or put it in a little box and frame it that way, they’re grossly mistaken,” he said. “To me what this illustrates is that you have this extraordinarily powerful surveillance technology – and a market that’s supplying it that’s almost entirely unregulated – being used by governments, as this case illustrates, that are unaccountable and have major public accountability and oversight problems. And so this is really a crisis of democracy – that’s the way I think about it – in Spain.” Deibert also hit back at suggestions that the Citizen Lab’s investigations were biased and had been compromised by the fact that one of its researchers, Elies Campo, had himself been targeted using spyware because of his apparent links to the independence movement. Deibert said Campo had been the victim of a “frankly baseless and really outrageous smear campaign”. He also said that he had been deeply troubled to discover that Campo’s father, a prominent doctor, had been targeted on his official hospital-issued phone, which would have contained sensitive medical information. Deibert said he rejected any suggestions that the Citizen Lab was politically motivated or somehow beholden to the Catalan independence movement. “We’re not a company, we never do commissioned research, we’re impartial, and we’re a university-based research group that’s run and supervised by me, the principal investigator, who manages every aspect of this project from beginning to end,” he said. While the Spanish government has refused to speculate on who may be responsible for targeting the phones of Sánchez and Robles, referring only to “illicit” and “external” attacks, fingers have been pointed in the direction of Morocco, which was engaged in a tense diplomatic standoff with Spain when the hacks took place. A data leak at the heart of the Pegasus investigation revealed more than 200 Spanish mobile numbers were selected as possible targets for surveillance in 2019 by an NSO Group client believed to be Morocco, but Morocco has denied spying on any foreign leaders using Pegasus, and has said reporters were “incapable of proving [the country had] any relationship” with NSO. Deibert said that, while he had no information on those attacks, there were two possible scenarios: that it was a foreign government, possibly Morocco; or that it was a “rogue domestic agency” operating against the state. “Given what I’ve seen in Spain, that’s an entirely plausible scenario,” he said. “Both cases – both hypotheses – point towards the urgent need for an independent, impartial inquiry.”",News/World news,Use of Pegasus spyware on Spain’s politicians causing ‘crisis of democracy’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/15/use-of-pegasus-spyware-on-spains-politicians-causing-crisis-of-democracy
5/16/2022,"Pascal Struijk’s dramatic late equaliser moved Leeds United out of the Premier League relegation zone at the expense of Burnley and earned Jesse Marsch’s side a potentially priceless point in their fight for survival against Brighton and Hove Albion. Danny Welbeck’s first-half strike looked as though it would consign Leeds to a fourth consecutive league defeat and leave the hosts facing the prospect of going into their final game of the season at Brentford next Sunday needing a mathematical miracle to survive if Burnley defeated Aston Villa in their remaining game in hand on Thursday. But just as defeat seemed inevitable for the hosts, Struijk’s header from Joe Gelhardt’s cross changed the entire dynamic of the final week, with Burnley now needing to avoid defeat on Thursday to keep their survival hopes in their own hands on the final day of the season. The scenes when Struijk equalised were a far cry from just a few minutes earlier. With Leeds appearing to be on their way to another defeat, the home supporters launched into a rendition of Marcelo Bielsa’s name before turning their ire on the board for their decision to sack Bielsa in February and appoint Marsch. For large periods of an absorbing afternoon in West Yorkshire it looked as though the heroics of the Brighton goalkeeper, Robert Sánchez, would pile more misery on Leeds too. After Welbeck’s clever chip put the Seagulls into a deserved lead, Leeds began to improve as half-time approached, with only a remarkable save from Sánchez to deny Mateusz Klich’s long-range strike keeping Brighton ahead at the interval. Prior to that, a superb last-ditch tackle from Robin Koch prevented Leandro Trossard from doubling Brighton’s lead but after the break, Leeds were the stronger of the two sides. Sánchez was on hand again to prevent Raphinha’s free-kick from finding the top corner before Klich was again denied by Sánchez shortly after Raphinha had skewed another opportunity. But just as it looked as though Leeds’ momentum had faded and they were headed for yet another defeat, Gelhardt scrambled to keep the ball alive in the Brighton box before chipping over Sánchez and allowing Struijk to send Elland Road into pandemonium with the goal that, if things pan out a certain way over the next seven days, could keep Leeds in the Premier League.",Sport/Football,Struijk strike earns draw with Brighton to keep Leeds’ survival hopes alive,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/15/leeds-brighton-premier-league-match-report
5/16/2022,"Just when it seemed the title race was done and dusted, along came Jarrod Bowen and Lukasz Fabianski. Two goals from the West Ham forward – his 17th and 18th of the season – and heroics from their goalkeeper to deny Riyad Mahrez’s late penalty means Manchester City must now beat Steven Gerrard’s Aston Villa next weekend to be certain of retaining their crown. Yet if Liverpool’s hopes of an unprecedented quadruple remain alive, Pep Guardiola must be grateful for their second half comeback through Jack Grealish and an own goal from Vladimir Coufal. In the end, City’s patched up side could even have ended up as winners on a topsy-turvy afternoon that saw West Ham supporters pay tribute to captain Mark Noble for the best part of two decades’ service. As well as a pre-match montage narrated by Danny Dyer in dedication to “Mr West Ham” and an enormous West Ham shirt cake emblazoned with the No 16 that was served in the pressroom beforehand, no expense had been spared for Noble’s big day. The 35-year-old born just down the road in Canning Town was given a standing ovation before kick-off, having also written a letter of appreciation in which he said he had “lived his dream” since making his first appearance under Alan Pardew in 2004. After their emphatic 4-0 win at Norwich last week, this was also another opportunity to consign the disappointment of the Europa League semifinal defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt and keep alive their chances of qualifying for the same competition again next season. David Moyes restored Tomas Soucek to his midfield while Guardiola was thankful to have Fernandinho and Aymeric Laporte available after both limped out of Wednesday’s 5-1 win at Wolves. That meant City’s three changes were in attack as Mahrez, Gabriel Jesus and JGrealish replaced Ilkay Gündogan, Raheem Sterling and Phil Foden. Guardiola hinted on Friday that the impending arrival of Erling Haaland may not be the end of City’s spending in the summer, with Fernandinho having already confirmed he will be moving on. Tasked with handling Michail Antonio and all his directness, the veteran Brazilian was caught out of position early on by Bowen’s deep ball that required Ederson to spring into action by tipping the cross over the bar. At the other end, Grealish should have made more of a close-range header following João Cancelo’s teasing cross before Fernandinho’s effort whistled just over. But it was from the resulting goal-kick that West Ham took the lead. Pablo Fornals did well to anticipate where the ball would drop after Antonio challenged Fernandinho in the air and his lobbed through ball picked out Bowen, who was being played onside by a dozing Laporte. The former Hull forward still had plenty of work to do yet he made the finish look simple. If the atmosphere was bouncing before then Bowen’s goal lifted it up another notch. One crushing late tackle by Coufal to bring down Grealish in full flight was greeted by a roar almost as loud as the Czech Republic defender was shown a yellow card by Anthony Taylor. It took some last-ditch defending from Kurt Zouma and Craig Dawson to keep City out, although Jesus will have been disappointed not to have done better with one opportunity that curled just past a post. West Ham’s second goal on the stroke of half-time was another example of City’s inability to defend the long ball. Once again, Antonio was sharper than Fernandinho to the loose ball and his delicate pass allowed Bowen ample time to pick his spot. Unsurprisingly, City emerged for the second half with renewed purpose and they were given an immediate reward when Grealish’s goal-bound shot deceived Fabianski after it deflecting off Dawson. They were almost level immediately when Kevin De Bruyne twice found space on the right but could not pick out a teammate before Fabianski saved at his near post from Jesus. The goalkeeper had to be on his toes again to keep out Bernardo Silva’s shot from close range as City piled on the pressure. With De Bruyne pulling the strings in midfield as West Ham dropped deeper and deeper, it seemed only a matter of time until they found an equaliser. From nowhere, Bowen then had a sniff of his hat-trick after Laporte and Oleksandr Zinchenko somehow contrived to give the ball away but he could only find the side netting. Antonio also wasted a golden opportunity after more poor defending from City when he opted to try and lob a stranded Ederson, only for the ball to sail well wide. How they and any Liverpool fans watching must have regretted those missed chances. The unfortunate Coufal could do nothing to prevent De Bruyne’s free-kick from diverting past Fabianski as he attempted to make the clearance as City finally found parity with 20 minutes to play. Bowen was unfortunate to see his shot strike Laporte’s heel and go behind just before Noble was brought on to replace Manuel Lanzini for his swansong. It was a misjudgment from Dawson on Jesus with six minutes remaining that provided Mahrez with the chance to seal the points from the spot after the referee had initially decided against awarding a penalty. But Fabianski’s dramatic save means all is still to play for.",Sport/Football,Manchester City held at West Ham after Riyad Mahrez fails from penalty spot,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/15/west-ham-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report
5/16/2022,"Thousands of south Asian people living with dementia in the UK are being denied access to help and support because stigma and taboo prevent them from getting diagnosed, a charity has warned. People from south Asian communities are more likely to develop dementia than the general UK population, due to being at higher risk of other illnesses, such as heart disease, stroke and diabetes, that increase the risk of dementia. However, the Alzheimer’s Society says they are less likely to come forward, with stigma and taboo among friends and family the biggest barrier to seeking a diagnosis. Fear of embarrassment and misunderstanding in south Asian communities is stopping those with dementia seeking help, the charity’s chief executive told the Guardian. “For anyone with dementia symptoms, getting a timely diagnosis is crucial – only then can they get access to vital treatments and support,” said Kate Lee. “But people in the south Asian community have told us the worrying reality is that stigma and taboo are often deterring families from getting support. “Living without a dementia diagnosis can be dangerous, with people ending up in crisis situations. Yes, a diagnosis can be daunting but it’s better to know – nine in 10 people with dementia have said that they benefited from getting diagnosed.” Alzheimer’s Society is launching a new campaign for Dementia Action Week to drive up diagnosis rates, and has produced dedicated resources and information for members of the Punjabi-speaking community. Anyone worried about their own or a relative’s memory is being encouraged to seek support in getting a diagnosis. When Bhagwant Sachdeva, 79, from Wolverhampton, first showed signs of dementia, the response from others was negative. “It was about four years ago that I first had a feeling something wasn’t right with me,” she said. “At my community group, I kept forgetting the other ladies’ names, losing my train of thought, or saying the wrong thing. They would say to me: ‘you’re going pagal’ [mad].” Doctors later confirmed that the former teacher had Alzheimer’s disease. Sachdeva says the diagnosis left her feeling “relieved” that she could now explain the symptoms to her friends. “I don’t hide my diagnosis from anyone, and I have no problem telling people about it. It’s allowed me to access medication to help me live well with dementia, raise awareness in my community, and feel understood.” Dr Kamel Hothi, an Alzheimer’s Society ambassador and special adviser to the Queen’s Commonwealth Trust, regrets her uncle not being diagnosed with dementia earlier. “As a family we didn’t speak about it, so we didn’t spot the signs sooner and this denied him access to the support and help available,” she said. “A diagnosis can be daunting, but it’s better to know and as a community, we need to step up for our loved ones, stop the stigma and act on the first signs of dementia.” Separate research published by the charity reveals that one in four people in the UK with dementia experience symptoms for over two years before they are diagnosed. It has produced a checklist with the Royal College of GPs to help people identify symptoms of dementia and seek help in getting diagnosed. It includes ticking whether people suffer memory problems, such as struggling to find the right words or repeating questions and phrases; issues with daily living, such as struggling to pay bills or getting lost; and behavioural or emotional problems, such as becoming aggressive or withdrawn, acting inappropriately or walking about. The charity’s poll of 1,019 people with dementia and their carers found that confusing dementia symptoms with getting old (42%) was the number one reason it took people so long to get a diagnosis. About 26% took more than two years to get a diagnosis, and a quarter of these sought one only after they had reached crisis point. “Asking the same question over and over again is not called getting old, it’s called getting ill,” said Lee. “With the pandemic causing diagnosis rates to plunge, it’s more important than ever to seek help. You don’t have to face dementia alone; we’re here to support everyone affected.”",News/Society,"Taboo stops south Asian people in UK seeking help for dementia, says charity",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/15/taboo-stops-south-asian-people-in-uk-seeking-help-for-dementia-says-charity
