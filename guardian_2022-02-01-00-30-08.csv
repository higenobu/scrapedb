2/1/2022,"When I was at the National Film and Television School, Channel 4 was running a writers’ competition. Unbeknown to me, one of the actors in a play I’d written and directed sent my script off. When I got the call saying I’d won, I went, “Oh, fuck off!” and hung up, thinking it was a joke.  But I got another call saying Humphrey Barclay, a producer, wanted to talk to me about doing a comedy. I thought: “I don’t really do comedy.” But I went to meet him, because he’s a legend. And on the bus there, we stopped on Queens Road in Peckham, London. I saw this barber’s called Fair Deal that I went to as a kid. It got me thinking. When I hit Humphrey’s office, I said: “I’ve got this idea set in a barber’s shop.” His face dropped all the way to Australia. He went: “Do you know how many sitcoms I get sent a week set in a barber’s shop?” I went: “This is not a barber’s shop – this is a community centre. This is where people can see, for the first time, a successful Black man running his own business. You don’t go there to get your hair cut! You go there to eat, watch sport and talk bollocks. You might get your haircut – but only if you give yourself three to four hours!” As soon as we started recording, the reaction was unbelievable. We were shooting in front of a live audience – and when jokes hit, they really went for it. People were laughing so hard, the sound man started complaining. It was so loud, we worried we wouldn’t be able to use the take. We’d have to say to the crowd: “Can you calm it down a bit?” Black Entertainment Television, a TV network in America, started showing Desmond’s which gave us a great platform. I met Whitney Houston, who told me how much she loved the show. I worked with Diddy. In fact, a lot of rappers were into Desmond’s big time. Ice Cube was a big fan – if you watch his first Barbershop film, it’s not too far from an episode of Desmond’s. I never wrote Desmond’s for Black people, though. I wrote it for white people. As far as certain newspapers were concerned, Black people patented mugging, but I wanted to show what actually happened behind closed doors. But do you know what gave me the greatest amount of joy about the show? The fact that its largest audience was in Northern Ireland. In a place where there weren’t Black communities, I was able to show them what we were really about. The BBC had offered me the lead part in a six-episode series, but I chose Desmond’s instead, because I loved the character of Porkpie. I just got him. It was also very attractive to me that Norman Beaton [who played Desmond] was going to be in the show. I’d known him for years and had worked with him before – I knew it would be good if he was involved. On set, it was such a marvellous, happy ensemble. The way we collaborated with each other and the camaraderie was great. We knew the neighbourhood, we knew those characters. We loved how it had been written. Norman and myself used to say: how can Trix, this young guy, get all these nuances of these West Indian characters? He was 30 years younger than us. He was a young boy. And he had somehow managed to create this incredible thing. I realised it was a hit after the very first series. When I’d go to the streets in my neighbourhood, people would start shouting, asking for my autograph, or running after me. In the early days, they’d always shout: “Desmond!” It didn’t matter who your character was. Even Carmen Munroe, who played Desmond’s wife Shirley, had “Desmond!” shouted at her. The thing I’m proudest of is that we reached people all over the world. I went to New York during the show’s run and the taxi driver from Kennedy airport wouldn’t take my fare! He said: “No, you’ve already given me so much pleasure!” And when I went to the Wembley concert to celebrate Nelson Mandela being released from prison, I actually met him. When he saw me, he did a double take – because he watched Desmond’s.

2/1/2022,"A party in Boris and Carrie Johnson’s flat is one of 12 events being investigated by the Metropolitan police over alleged breaches of lockdown, it has emerged, as the Sue Gray report found “failures of leadership and judgment” in No 10. Gray, a senior civil servant, criticised the culture in Boris Johnson’s Downing Street that allowed social gatherings to take place during lockdown, which were “difficult to justify”.  The findings were released on the government’s website in a shortened and redacted form, after the Met last week said it was investigating some of the gatherings. In the report, Gray did not criticise the prime minister personally but highlighted failures of leadership in No 10 and the Cabinet Office. The 12-page report said: “At least some of the gatherings in question represent a serious failure to observe not just the high standards expected of those working at the heart of government but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time.” She added: “At times it seems there was too little thought given to what was happening across the country in considering the appropriateness of some of these gatherings, the risks they presented to public health and how they might appear to the public. “There were failures of leadership and judgment by different parts of No 10 and the Cabinet Office at different times. Some of the events should not have been allowed to take place. Other events should not have been allowed to develop as they did.” Johnson will make a statement to the Commons on Monday at 3.30pm, with many of his MPs having said they would consider the report’s findings before making a decision on whether to continue supporting him as prime minister. Gray listed 16 gatherings that she had examined for evidence of rule-breaking, of which 12 are being investigated by police. These include a gathering in the No 10 flat – thought to be a reference to the prime minister’s own residence even though he lives at No 11 – and a Christmas party in Downing Street, as well as several leaving parties. The civil service chief said she had interviewed more than 70 people and examined relevant email information, WhatsApp messages, photographs and exit logs. She said some staff had “wanted to raise concerns about behaviours they witnessed at work but at times felt unable to do so”. “A number of these gatherings should not have been allowed to take place, or to develop in the way that they did. There is significant learning to be drawn from these events which must be addressed immediately across government.” Gray said her report was limited by the Met police’s request for her to make only minimal reference to gatherings they were investigating. She said she had decided not to publish factual accounts of the other four dates as she did not feel able to do so without detriment to the overall balance of findings. However, she left the door open to returning to the evidence she gathered after the Met police had investigated, saying it was being stored and saved “until such time as it may be required further”. Earlier on Monday, No 10 had said it was “unclear” whether she would publish a further, more comprehensive, report in the future.",News/Politics,Sue Gray ‘partygate’ report criticises No 10 failures of leadership,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/31/sue-gray-report-criticises-no-10-over-difficult-to-justify-parties
2/1/2022,"With Omicron ripping through the nation’s schools, and the rules on mask-wearing, travel testing and vaccine passports all in flux, the public might have expected to hear from Boris Johnson at the Downing Street podium in recent days. But the embattled prime minister last gave a Downing Street press conference almost four weeks ago, on 4 January.  Instead, as partygate revelations have continued to emerge, we have seen him in a series of carefully-choreographed public appearances at a vaccine centre, a school or a green energy project. Occasionally, journalists are allowed to fire a few questions at him – but since a disastrous interview with Sky political editor, Beth Rigby, a fortnight ago he has submitted himself to little public scrutiny. Johnson’s image has always been carefully controlled. He employs a taxpayer-funded photographer on a salary of more than £100,000 a year, and his aides have long favoured scripted broadcast clips as a way of putting his message across directly to the public. And as he fights for his political life, Johnson’s every move is being as carefully controlled as it was during the 2019 general election campaign, when he dodged major interviews, and was so reluctant to answer impromptu questions that at one point he hid in a fridge. That bunker mentality is expected to continue this week, as Downing Street plans a flurry of announcements to distract Johnson’s own MPs from Sue Gray’s pared-back report and the ongoing police inquiry. Political journalists have travelled with previous prime ministers to Iraq and Afghanistan but when Johnson flies to Ukraine on Tuesday, he will do so without the scrutiny of a pack of pesky reporters – although one doughty wire journalist and one broadcast team will go along to record proceedings. Despite the humility he has awkwardly sought to display in his public apologies for lockdown-busting behaviour in Downing Street, by hot-footing it to Ukraine he appears determined to project political strength. That echoes the bullishness on display in the House of Commons last week as he confronted Keir Starmer, with Tory backbenchers roaring him on. Labour frontbencher Emily Thornberry, who shadowed Johnson when he was foreign secretary, calls it “strongman politics” – she has accused him of aping Donald Trump and the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, in wanting to project a macho public image. When there were questions about Johnson’s health in the wake of his severe bout of Covid in 2020, he treated an interviewer from the Mail on Sunday– and their photographer – to a display of press-ups. Aside from tough guy, Johnson’s other winning public persona is the bumbling-but-likeable buffoon – perhaps the worst possible demeanour for a man accused of overseeing (or failing to notice) a slapdash party culture. It will be a sure sign that No 10 believes he has weathered the storm, if the prime minister returns to his bumbling old ways – but for the next perilous few days, his every utterance is likely to be carefully controlled, and the Downing Street podium kept firmly under wraps.",News/Politics,Johnson still seeking to control image in eye of partygate storm,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/31/expect-johnson-to-hide-in-his-bunker-until-hes-weathered-the-storm
2/1/2022,"Senior ministers in the Welsh and Scottish governments have furiously criticised “last-minute and cack-handed” plans from the Conservatives to scrap or amend thousands of EU rules. The move – nicknamed the “Brexit freedoms bill” – has also raised alarm from constitutional experts who said it would make it easier for ministers to bulldoze through important parliamentary scrutiny.  Senior sources in the devolved governments have accused the UK government of failing to properly consult ministers in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Stormont, even though the proposals, released on Monday by No 10, will have a significant impact on hundreds of areas controlled by devolved governments. One source said the Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish parliaments first learned an announcement was imminent when they were invited at 1.51pm last Friday to an unexpected meeting on Saturday with Suella Braverman, the attorney general. It involved ministers from all three devolved administrations and the cabinet ministers for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The source said Braverman was badly briefed and was unable to provide full answers to questions the Scottish government asked, even though the proposals had a direct impact on Scottish law and policy. “There were no meaningful answers at all,” said one source. Another said the meeting was “last-minute, fractious, and cack-handed”. Hannah White, the deputy director of the Institute for Government, said MPs needed to closely scrutinise the scope of ministers’ powers to change retained EU law without primary legislation. “Allowing ministers to repeal or modify fundamental rights embodied in retained EU law without full parliamentary scrutiny would be wrong,” she told the Guardian. Dr Ronan Cormacain, a senior research fellow at the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law, said the proposal “appears to be proposing a system to change EU law which bypasses parliament. Under the guise of taking back control, it would appear that the executive is taking away control from parliament and giving it to ministers. “There is nothing wrong with making new laws that deviate from the EU. There is everything wrong with bypassing parliament to do so.” The devolved governments suspect the rushed launch of the proposals suggest UK government departments are under intense pressure to announce major policies to deflect attention from the “partygate” crisis threatening Boris Johnson’s premiership. Mick Antoniw, the Welsh government’s constitution minister, was described as furious. He said after the meeting the proposals would “drive a coach and horses through the concept of mutual consent”. There was no effort by the UK government to properly consult devolved governments on the details of the plans nor seek their views on their impacts on devolved areas of policy and law. Angus Robertson, the Scottish constitution affairs secretary, said the mishandling raised profound doubts about Boris Johnson’s pledge earlier in January to promote “mutual respect, maintaining trust and positive working” between the four governments, as part of a new ministerial council the prime minister would chair. Johnson’s initiative, instigated by Michael Gove, the UK minister for intergovernmental relations, followed increasingly angry complaints the UK government has failed to consult devolved leaders or to respect their independent policymaking over Brexit and its impacts, including reforms of the UK’s internal market. “Within days of the UK government promising more respectful ways of working, we were informed of what is clearly a rushed exercise over the weekend with nothing more than a vague verbal briefing,” Robertson said. “If these proposals involve changing the law in devolved policy areas, then pressing ahead without the consent of the Scottish parliament would demonstrate yet again the UK government’s intent to undermine devolution.” The areas affected by the proposed bill, which has yet to be published, include climate policy, agricultural rules, food safety, genetic modification, vehicle safety and industrial subsidies. Many of these areas are directly controlled by devolved parliaments.",News/Politics,Scottish and Welsh ministers criticise ‘cack-handed’ plans to scrap EU rules,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/31/scottish-and-welsh-ministers-criticise-cack-handed-plans-to-scrap-eu-rules

2/1/2022,"My friend William Blackburn, who has died aged 92, was an American businessman who – before the arrival of Häagen-Dazs and Baskin-Robbins – introduced the British to ice-cream flavours from the US. Horrified by his first bite into the English product, Bill saw a golden market waiting for an entrepreneur. His New England Ice Cream Company, set up in London in 1972, was soon selling its delicious flavours from ice-cream parlours in some of the city’s department stores, including Harrods, Debenhams and Barkers.  Bill was born in Evanston, Illinois, to Oliver Blackburn, a company secretary at Kraft Cheese, and his wife, Phrania (nee Carver). At New Trier high school in Winnetka he proved himself to be an excellent pianist and after attending Princeton University, where he majored in comparative literature, he went on to the Harvard Law School for two years, until his studies were forcibly interrupted by military service in the Korean war. The army seems to have turned him against the discipline of the law, because, on his return to civilian life he instead plunged into Chicago’s advertising world. From there he moved to New York and joined one of the oldest and largest American advertising companies, Benton & Bowles. There he worked for big name businesses such as Procter and Gamble, for whom he created the brand name Pampers for “the first flushable and disposable nappy”. In 1962 he was transferred to work in their London office, but soon broke away to found his own London-based advertising company, Blackburn Daley. In London, Bill continued his interest in the piano with instruction from the celebrated pianist and teacher Maria Donska, and his house became a place for musical evenings, where you might meet the likes of Stephen Spender, Anthony Sampson, Freddie Ayer, Humphrey Burton and Julia O’Faolain. I first met William and his wife, Susan (nee Smith), in the early 1970s and found him a most attractive man with a strong Christian faith – amiable, social, relaxed, always a keen reader, and something of a thinker. In 1978, following Susan’s death from breast cancer, Bill channelled his grief into a charitable endeavour to honour and memorialise her. Together with Susan’s sister, Emilie (Mimi) Kilgore, he established the first and still most prestigious award for female playwrights, the Susan Smith Blackburn prize, which is awarded annually to women from around the world who have written works of outstanding quality for the English-speaking theatre. Since the prize’s foundation, 10 Susan Smith Blackburn finalist plays have subsequently won the Pulitzer prize for drama. In 1987 Bill married the fashion designer Perri Thompson and went into business with her, forming the fashion company Perri Ashby. His artistic zest never flagged, and even during the last decade of his life he recorded himself playing Chopin, Schubert, Mozart, and Beethoven. He is survived by Perri, their daughter Christabel, two children from his first marriage, Lucy and Adam, and seven grandchildren.",Lifestyle/Food, William Blackburn obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/31/william-blackburn-obituary
2/1/2022,"Prosecutors have reached plea deals with two of three white men convicted of the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, the 25-year-old Black man they chased and fatally shot in a Georgia neighborhood while he was jogging two years ago. The men have already been sentenced to life in prison. The deals concern a federal hate crimes trial due to start next month.  Notices filed on Sunday in US district court in southern Georgia concerned plea deals for father and son Gregory McMichael and Travis McMichael but did not reveal details. If agreed by the court, the documents said, the deals would “dispose of the charges pending”. William “Roddie” Bryan, the third convicted man, was not mentioned. In a press release, Arbery’s family said the deals would allow the McMichaels to serve the first 30 years of their prison sentence in a “preferred federal prison”. In a statement, the family denounced an “unauthorized back-room plea deal”. “Both Wanda Cooper Jones and Marcus Arbery, the parents of Ahmaud Arbery, are vehemently against this deal and expressed this directly on calls with [Department of Justice] officials today,” the statement said. Cooper Jones was scheduled to press her claim in court on Monday. Ahmaud Arbery was killed in February 2020 in the coastal town of Satilla Shores. The McMichaels and Bryan pursued him, claiming they suspected his involvement in a series of burglaries. The McMichaels, both carrying firearms, attempted to corner Arbery using their truck. The younger McMichael fired three times with a shotgun. None of the men were charged until eyewitness footage was made public months later, shortly before the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis prompted widespread protests for racial justice. The trial that followed gained widespread attention, civil rights leaders including the Rev Jesse Jackson attending in solidarity with Arbery’s family. Joe Biden has called the murder “a devastating reminder of how far we have to go in the fight for racial justice in this country”. The McMichaels and Bryan were found guilty of murder in November. Before sentencing, the judge, Timothy Walmsley, said: “Ahmaud Arbery was hunted down and shot, and he was killed because individuals here in the courtroom took the law into their own hands.” The three men were sentenced to life in prison. The judge, Timothy Walmsley, ruled that Bryan can seek parole after 30 years but the McMichaels cannot. In their statement on Sunday, the Arbery family said: “This proposed plea deal is a huge accommodation to the men who hunted down and murdered Ahmaud Arbery. The family is devastated at the development, their wishes are being completely ignored and they do not consent to these accommodations.” In a separate statement, Cooper Jones accused the Department of Justice of having “gone behind my back to offer the men who murdered my son a deal to make their time in prison easier for them to serve”. “I have been completely betrayed by DoJ lawyers,” she said.",News/US news,Ahmaud Arbery family express anger at plea deal for two of Black jogger’s killers,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/31/ahmaud-arbery-plea-deal-gregory-travis-mcmichael
2/1/2022,"Kamala Harris, then vice-president elect, drove within yards of a pipe bomb left outside the Democratic National Committee on January 6 2021 and remained inside for nearly two hours before the bomb was found, it was reported on Monday.  Harris’s proximity to the bomb was known previously, but not how close or for how long. CNN reported the new details in the case, part of alarming events in Washington on the day Congress met to certify Joe Biden’s election victory over Donald Trump. A pipe bomb was also left near the Republican National Committee. More than a year later, no suspect has been named or apprehended. Citing “multiple sources”, CNN said Harris “pulled into DNC headquarters in Washington at around 11.30am ET with her motorcade through the garage leading to the parking deck near where law enforcement discovered the pipe bomb”. It also cited a US Capitol police document that showed “an unnamed ‘protectee’ was removed from the DNC building at approximately 1.14pm ET – seven minutes after Capitol Police began investigating the bomb”. That protectee was known to be Harris when Politico first reported the story, but it was not known how long she was in the building. More than 700 people have been charged in connection with the attack on the Capitol on January 6, including 11 members of a far-right militia who face charges of seditious conspiracy. One rioter pleaded guilty to bringing with him Molotov cocktails, guns and other weapons. The rioters attacked after Donald Trump told them to “fight like hell” in service of his lie that his defeat by Biden was the result of electoral fraud. Seven people died and more than 100 police officers were injured. Trump was impeached but acquitted. A House committee has recommended criminal charges. Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser, has pleaded not guilty to contempt of Congress. The White House and Harris’s office did not comment on CNN’s pipe bomb report. A Secret Service spokesperson told CNN that “in order to maintain operational security”, it did not comment on protection arrangements. CNN said a “law enforcement source” said the Secret Service “swept the interior of the building, the driveway, parking deck and entrances and exits prior to [Harris’s] arrival” and Harris was “evacuated using an alternate route away from the bomb”. Earlier this month, Lis Wiehl, a former prosecutor and author of a book on the hunt for the Unabomber, told the Atlantic would-be bombers were usually “trying to send a message through killing people”. Of the Capitol Hill pipe bomber, she said: “Because it wasn’t successful and they weren’t apprehended, you can bet they’re thinking about doing it again – and doing it better.”",News/US news,Kamala Harris drove within yards of pipe bomb on January 6 – report,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/31/kamala-harris-pipe-bomb-january-6-report
