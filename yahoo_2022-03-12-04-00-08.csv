3/12/2022,"An overly affectionate Florida woman apparently had other motives, police say. According to a Facebook post from the Clearwater Police Department, Kathy Stevens, aka “the hugging bandit,” was arrested Thursday. Cops gave the suspect the nickname, which originally comes from the 1948 movie “The Kissing Bandit,” starring Frank Sinatra as a wimp who finds out his father was a thief whose trademark was kissing his female victims. The moniker was later used for Morganna, a ‘70s entertainer who used to rush sports fields to smooch professional players. Stevens, 65, is accused of approaching “older men” outside stores, pretending to know them, then going in for a hug. During the embrace, Stevens “would help herself to their wallets and credit cards,” authorities say, referring to at least four instances. The post also includes screenshots of surveillance footage of her allegedly using stolen credit cards taken from the person she had just hugged. Stevens, who faces more than a dozen charges, has apparently been pulling her sketchy public displays of affection in the Tampa Bay area as well. The senior citizen is behind bars at Pinellas County Jail awaiting trial on $113,750 bail, according to court records.",U.S./Miami Herald,"The ‘hugging bandit’ was just arrested in Florida.

3/12/2022,"By Andrius Sytas VILNIUS (Reuters) - Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte was sworn in on Friday as a member of the Riflemen's Union, a paramilitary volunteer force that supports the police and the army and has seen a surge in applications since Russia invaded Ukraine. Over 2,000 applications to join the force have been received since the conflict began, bringing total numbers to 12,000, about a third of them women, the Union said?. Members of the union receive limited military training within their units and volunteer to help the police or the military as needed in certain functions. Simonyte was one of several hundred who took the oath on Friday in front of parliament, on the anniversary of Lithuania becoming the first Soviet republic to declare independence from the Soviet Union, in 1990. ""I see that many people feel restless now,"" she said. ""Volunteering, for instance with the Riflemen's Union, is one good activity to turn to."" The Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, once ruled from Moscow but now part of NATO and the European Union, have received troop deployments from their Western partners to help protect them, and NATO's eastern border, against any threat from Russia and its close ally Belarus.

3/12/2022,"The Russian government and general prosecutor's office are considering a proposal to nationalize the assets of foreign companies that are suspending operations or pulling out of Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, the Russian newspaper Izvestia reported Thursday. The report included a list of nearly 60 companies, including McDonald's, Apple, IKEA, Microsoft, IBM, and Porsche. ""All of these businesses have offices, buildings, factories, storefronts in Russia"" that could be ""forcibly taken by the state,"" BBC News reports. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki publicly warned the Kremlin last Thursday that ""any lawless decision by Russia to seize the assets of these companies will ultimately result in even more economic pain for Russia."" She said nationalizing foreign assets would squander any trust Russia has built up since it scared off all foreign investors in the Bolshevik Revolution. Earlier this week, Russia effectively legalized patent theft, issuing a decree that patent protections will not be enforced for anyone affiliated with its list of ""unfriendly"" countries. President Biden, meanwhile, is expected to announce on Friday the removal of Russia's ""most favored nation"" trade status, in concert with the European Union and G-7 nations. That will allow the U.S. and its allies to slap tariffs on any Russian imports not already blocked by mounting sanctions. Fitch on Wednesday joined the other two major credit rating agencies and downgraded Russia's sovereign credit to junk status, warning of an ""imminent"" default on Russia's sovereign debt. ""The downgrades are signals to investors to steer clear of Russia,"" but a default ""could have far more sweeping consequences, sending lenders scurrying for financial high ground and fleeing developing international markets that rely on risk-tolerant investors,"" The Washington Post reports. A default would also create ""tremendous economic hardship for ordinary"" Russians. ""Over the very short term, Russia is a pariah,"" said George Ball, chairman of Houston-based financial services firm Sanders Morris Harris. ""Whether it's their oil, their economy or their sovereign debt, nobody wants to touch it. ... People who have assets in Russia or deposits in Russia are toast for now and for some time ahead. They can't get their hands on money or securities or goods or services. They are outcast and they will over the shorter term freeze to death.""
