2/1/2022,"Craig Fairbrass (Villain, Muscle, Rise of the Footsoldier franchise) is an actor who may lack range but has an undeniable screen presence. He emits an almost radioactive glow with his hulking, jolie-laide physiognomy, amplified by an abraded, East End baritone that seldom rises above a menacing whisper. That charisma goes a long way in this prison drama, written and directed by Ross McCall, which consists of a weary procession of scenes in which Fairbrass’s longtime convict Steve Mackelson growls, glowers and recites monologues full of self-serious pauses about prison life and how hard he thinks he is. All this seems to take place in one or two rooms in one of Her Majesty’s establishments where budget cuts appear to have deprived the cells of lightbulbs. A moderate amount of backlighting is supplied by a strip of window high in one black wall. No wonder the supporting officers (SOs) can never tell what’s going on. The deprivations also extend to the prisoners’ and support officers’ language, worn back to the stubs of self-expression so that they can only speak in prison slang (“tooled up”, “burner”, “peas” and the like) or the word “cunt”, which in this world is so ubiquitous it’s practically a pronoun.  The monotony gets broken up a little by a subplot about Steve’s cellmate Marcus (Stephen Odubola), a young man in for a seven-year stretch whom he begrudgingly protects from other criminals who are convinced he’s an informer. Meanwhile, Steve weighs up whether to accept a request to meet his daughter, who was only a little girl when he went away for killing her mother and her lover. Supporting performers Jason Flemyng and Ulrich Thomsen bring their angular cheekbones to the party to fill out the lineup of gaunt, dead-eyed men, while Rosie Sheehy is excellent in the climactic scene as Steve’s daughter. The over-forceful musical score won’t help viewers already straining to understand what the hell is going on, but the chthonic atmosphere is oddly mesmerising, perhaps because – like a prison sentence – it wears you down eventually.

2/1/2022,"The squad has long been filled out by mediocrity so, on one level, the departures of six players who were not regular starters is welcome. But the fact nobody has come in, despite an obvious need up front and an attempt to sign the Juventus-bound Dusan Vlahovic, rings alarm bells and their push for a top-four spot looks a couple of injuries away from derailment. The sanctioning of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s move to Barcelona without his being replaced speaks to Mikel Arteta’s uncompromising principles but also leaves their attacking ranks perilously thin. Nick Ames  Key ins None. Key outs Ainsley Maitland-Niles (Roma, loan), Folarin Balogun (Middlesbrough, loan), Sead Kolasinac (Marseille), Pablo Marí (Udinese, loan), Calum Chambers (Aston Villa) Financial might and Steven Gerrard’s pulling power could help turn Villa into a potent force. The clearest evidence of that so far is the signing of Philippe Coutinho, whose return to the Premier League was one of January’s most exciting deals. Lucas Digne’s arrival, followed by Matt Targett’s departure, showed that Gerrard has a clear view of how he wants to improve Villa. The overhaul is far from complete – notably they did not upgrade the base of their midfield, although they did fend off interest in Douglas Luiz – but Villa should finish this season strongly. Paul Doyle Key ins Philippe Coutinho (Barcelona, loan), Lucas Digne (Everton), Robin Olsen (Roma, loan), Calum Chambers (Arsenal). Key outs Anwar El Ghazi (Everton, loan), Matt Targett (Newcastle, loan) The arrival of Christian Eriksen on a deal until the end of the season made headlines around the world and the playmaker should feel at home as one of nine Danish players on the books after the signing of goalkeeper Jonas Lössl this month. Thomas Frank and his assistant Brian Riemer agreed contract extensions to leave Brentford feeling even more unified before the final push for survival. Ed Aarons Key ins Jonas Lössl (Midtjylland), Christian Eriksen (unattached) Key outs Marcus Forss (Hull, loan), Charlie Goode (Sheffield United, loan) A busier window than might have been expected ended with Yves Bissouma still at the club despite strong interest from Aston Villa and others and the departure of Dan Burn to Newcastle. A deal for a much-coveted striker was agreed, although Deniz Undav will stay on loan with the Belgian side Royale Union Saint-Gilloise until the end of the season after agreeing a four-year deal. Meanwhile, the defender Odel Offiah – nephew of the former rugby league star Martin – extended his contract until 2024.

Key outs Aaron Connolly (Middlesbrough, loan), Kacper Kozlowski (Royale Union St-Gilloise, loan), Dan Burn (Newcastle) The club are pretty much back where they started on 1 January. Chris Wood was sold after Newcastle triggered his release clause, leaving Burnley with a gaping hole in their forward line. Deadline day brought the arrival of the Netherlands striker Wout Weghorst as a like-for-like replacement. At Wolfsburg the 29-year-old had a record of one goal in every two games, which will give Sean Dyche hope Weghorst can fire the club to safety. They missed out on Dinamo Zagreb’s Mislav Orsic and on Aaron Ramsey, to make it an uninspiring window for a club in trouble. Will Unwin Key ins Wout Weghorst (Wolfsburg). Key outs Chris Wood (Newcastle) The club refused to panic after attempts to cut short Emerson Palmieri’s loan at Lyon proved unsuccessful. They are short of cover at left wing-back after losing Ben Chilwell to injury for the rest of the season, but Thomas Tuchel has shown he can be flexible with the players at his disposal. It would not have made sense to buy a left-sided player and Tuchel saw no reason to act once it was clear that suitable loan targets were thin on the ground. Jacob Steinberg Key ins None. Key outs None Early hopes of signing Manchester United’s Donny van de Beek on loan faded quickly once Everton entered the frame, with similar interest in Dele Alli also failing to ignite. A permanent deal for the striker Jean-Phillippe Mateta after the Frenchman’s initial 18-month loan expired could prove a smart piece of business and further recruitment is expected in the summer. EA Key ins Jean-Philippe Mateta (Mainz). Key outs None The deadline-day arrivals of Frank Lampard, Donny van de Beek and Dele Alli injected much-needed optimism into Everton’s season, yet the window as a whole shone an unforgiving light on how the club is run. Rafael Benítez, his authority increased after the departure of the director of football Marcel Brands, bought in two full-backs for an initial outlay of £29m and sold Lucas Digne after a fall-out. He was sacked a few days later. The unplanned signing of Anwar El Ghazi limited his successor’s options for domestic loans. Andy Hunter Key ins Vitalii Mykolenko (Dynamo Kyiv), Nathan Patterson (Rangers), Anwar El Ghazi (Aston Villa, loan), Donny van de Beek (Man Utd, loan), Dele Alli (Spurs). Key outs Lucas Digne (Aston Villa) Ostensibly a risk-averse window but will Marcelo Bielsa’s decision not to sign one senior player prove a high-stakes gamble? Admittedly the manager wanted Brenden Aaronson, Red Bull Salzburg’s £20m-rated United States forward, but Salzburg would not sell. Although Leeds never contemplated accepting West Ham’s ambitious offers for Kalvin Phillips and Raphinha, Phillips ranks among a raft of injured senior players also including Patrick Bamford. Much hinges on their return. Louise Taylor Key ins None. Key outs None Brendan Rodgers knew that budgetary constraints meant there was no prospect of spending big but he hoped the club would make at least one acquisition: a centre-back. Leicester could not find one available at the right price so they will go into the second part of the season hoping that Wesley Fofana, who has resumed light training after the broken leg suffered in pre-season, regains full fitness and top form soon. PD Key ins None. Key outs Filip Benkovic (released) It was looking like another quiet window at Anfield until Porto agreed a fee with Tottenham for Luis Díaz and then a well-oiled transfer machine kicked into gear again. Liverpool’s outgoing sporting director, Michael Edwards, and his assistant, and successor, Julian Ward, swooped in to sign the gifted winger who Jürgen Klopp had intended to sign this summer. Mohamed Salah will have taken note. There was late frustration when a proposed deal for Fulham’s exciting teenager Fabio Carvalho fell through owing to time constraints, although a pre-contract agreement is possible. AH Key ins Luis Díaz (Porto). Key outs Nat Phillips (Bournemouth, loan), Neco Williams (Fulham, loan) Julián Álvarez, a 21-year-old River Plate (and Argentina) forward, was Pep Guardiola’s only major piece of business, though he will not join until the summer. Despite the manager’s high-flying defending champions apparently being so far past the need for a centre-forward it is no longer a talking point, expect a move for a dedicated marksmen in the next window: Erling Haaland of Borussia Dortmund remains a prime target. Jamie Jackson Key ins Julián Álvarez (River Plate). Key outs Ferran Torres (Barcelona), Taylor Harwood-Bellis (Stoke City) The quest for a midfielder who can run games at a la N’Golo Kanté, Declan Rice or Kevin De Bruyne continues. Ralf Rangnick’s contact books, built up during a 39-year career as manager and director of football, have failed to land an addition that would instantly enhance chances of a top-four finish, FA Cup glory and moving beyond Atlético Madrid into the Champions League quarter-finals, at least. January is the harder window for acquisitions, yet not to strengthen with the campaign so delicately poised will disappoint fans. JJ Key ins None. Key outs Axel Tuanzebe (Napoli, loan), Anthony Martial (Sevilla, loan), Amad Diallo (Rangers, loan), Donny van de Beek (Everton, loan) Newcastle were left with an amalgam of quiet satisfaction and mild disappointment. While Eddie Howe’s team has been strengthened in central defence, at full-back, centre-forward, and, perhaps most significantly, in central midfield – where Brazil’s Bruno Guimarães could exert a significant impact on the relegation battle – they failed to secure some much coveted targets. Although the centre-halves Sven Botman and Diego Carlos are still at Lille and Sevilla respectively and Jesse Lingard’s creativity remains at Old Trafford, it has been a decent window. LT Key ins Kieran Trippier (Atlético Madrid), Chris Wood (Burnley), Bruno Guimarães (Lyon), Matt Targett (Aston Villa, loan), Dan Burn (Brighton). Key outs Freddie Woodman (Bournemouth, loan), Jeff Hendrick (QPR, loan) The club said that any transfer incomings would be highly unlikely from the moment the summer window closed last September. That turned out to be accurate, with the relegation-threatened club not even linked to players in the gossip columns. There were no sales either, but the loan move of local boy and former great hope Todd Cantwell to Bournemouth, with a permanent option in the summer, did at least raise a few eyebrows. Paul MacInnes Key ins None. Key outs Todd Cantwell (Bournemouth, loan) Ralph Hasenhüttl was always relaxed about the window given the depth added to the squad last summer. Armando Broja has been a big hit on loan from Chelsea but the Saints will have to wait – and no doubt fend off others – to pull off any permanent deal. Dynel Simeu, who joined Southampton’s B team from Chelsea last summer, will gain first-team experience on loan at Carlisle for the rest of the season, and the 16-year-old defender Will Armitage has arrived from Cheltenham for about £200,000. Ben Fisher Key ins None. Key outs None Antonio Conte would have liked the purge to run deeper – to include a couple of defenders – but it still reverberated loudly. Two in, four out in midfield and wide areas. But it was two he will trust (Rodrigo Bentancur and Dejan Kulusevski) versus four he did not (Tanguy Ndombele, Giovani Lo Celso, Dele Alli and Bryan Gil). So an upgrade? For Conte, it was something, a step in the right direction, but there was no new right wing-back (a big miss) and no back-up striker. David Hytner Key ins Rodrigo Bentancur (Juventus), Dejan Kulusevski (Juventus, loan). Key outs Tanguy Ndombele (Lyon, loan), Bryan Gil (Valencia, loan), Giovani Lo Celso (Villarreal, loan), Dele Alli (Everton) Trying to navigate the choppy waters of the January window is difficult enough in normal circumstances but becomes almost impossible if you change manager during it. By the time Roy Hodgson came in on 25 January Watford’s business was pretty much done, the club strengthening where they needed to with Samir at centre-back, Edo Kayembe in defensive midfield and Hassane Kamara at left-back. Six players were signed for about £20m but will it be enough to stay up? Marcus Christenson Key ins Maduka Okoye (Sparta Rotterdam), Hassane Kamara (Nice), Samir (Udinese), Edo Kayembe (Eupen), Samuel Kalu (Bordeaux). Key outs Maduka Okoye (Sparta Rotterdam, loan) Have West Ham let a wonderful opportunity slip from their grasp? They will argue that January is a difficult time to do business, but their need for more depth was clear long before Christmas. The squad is light and the failure to bring in cover in defence and attack could cost them in the race to finish fourth. Ultimately, there was not enough vision. Several targets felt unrealistic and David Moyes was reluctant to gamble on certain players. JS Key ins None. Key outs None Bruno Lage is going to have to continue excelling on modest resources. The manager identified three areas where he hoped to strengthen his small squad: centre-back, winger and striker. He got a promising winger – the 21-year-old Chiquinho – but also lost a unique one in Adama Traoré. For central defence, the club recalled Toti Gomes from a loan at Grasshoppers Zurich. And they signed a striker who was already at Molineux, with Hwang Hee-chan’s loan move made permanent.

2/1/2022,"A Tory former chief whip has urged Boris Johnson to withdraw an insinuation about Keir Starmer refusing to prosecute the serial sex offender Jimmy Savile, which the Labour leader called “a slur, a lie”. After Starmer responded in the Commons to Sue Gray’s report on alleged Covid rule-breaking in Downing Street, Johnson called him “a former director of public prosecutions, who spent more time prosecuting journalists and failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile”.  Julian Smith, the former Conservative Northern Ireland secretary and chief whip, said Johnson’s comments about the child sexual abuser were unacceptable. The claim has been promoted by far-right conspiracist Facebook groups. “The smear made against Keir Starmer relating to Jimmy Savile yesterday is wrong and cannot be defended,” he tweeted. “It should be withdrawn. False and baseless personal slurs are dangerous, corrode trust and can’t just be accepted as part of the cut and thrust of parliamentary debate.” Two cabinet ministers have defended Johnson’s decision to use the false claim in the Commons but one admitted they could not substantiate it. The deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab, said it was part of the “cut and thrust of parliamentary debates and exchanges” but said he was not prepared to repeat the allegation. “I don’t have the facts to verify this … I don’t have the facts to justify that. I can’t substantiate that claim,” Raab told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, told Channel 4 News: “I have no idea of the background of Keir Starmer … The prime minister tells the truth.” Speaking on Sky News, the Labour leader said it was clear Tory MPs were uncomfortable with the false claim. “It’s a ridiculous slur peddled by rightwing trolls … I saw the faces of the Conservative MPs, the disgust on their faces that their prime minister was debasing himself by sinking so low in the chamber was clear,” he said. “He’d been advised not to do it because it’s obviously not true, but he does it because he doesn’t understand what honesty and integrity means. Many of them expressed that to me, disgust at their prime minister for debasing himself in the House of Commons instead of acting with the contrition and the integrity that he should have shown yesterday. “He does what he always does, which is to try to drag everybody into the gutter with him. One thing we know about this prime minister is everybody who has ever come into contact with him always gets damaged in the process.” Nazir Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor for the north-west of England, said Johnson’s reference to Savile was “a disgrace to parliament and office of prime minister”. Johnson’s insinuation in parliament that Starmer personally failed to charge Savile echoes claims made by online conspiracy theorists. The fact-checking organisation Full Fact looked into the claim in June 2020. It found: “Mr Starmer was head of the [Crown Prosecution Service] when the decision was made not to prosecute Savile but he was not the reviewing lawyer for the case.” The first popular Facebook post containing the claim was shared by a page called Recusant Nine, which posts conspiracy theories about “Asian grooming gangs” and says it aims to “lift the lid on the relationship between Labour party politicians, council officers and the Asian criminal cartels that really run [Oldham]”. The post claims that Starmer “decided there was ‘insufficient evidence’ to charge Savile”. It has been shared 2,400 times, and was copied and pasted by a network of pro-Brexit Facebook pages shortly after it was posted in April 2020. Starmer commissioned an investigation into the CPS decision not to prosecute Savile, and later apologised for “errors of judgment” made by police officers and the CPS prosecutor on the case. The investigation did not suggest Starmer was personally involved in the decisions made. In 2007 and 2008, the police investigated a number of complaints about Savile engaging in sexual behaviour with young girls. He was interviewed under caution in October 2009 but not charged with any offence. Since his death in 2011 it has emerged that he sexually abused hundreds of children and women at locations including hospitals, schools and the BBC.",News/Politics,Tory ex-chief whip urges Boris Johnson to withdraw Starmer Savile ‘smear’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/01/boris-johnson-keir-starmer-jimmy-savile-smear-julian-smith
2/1/2022,"The chair of the Beijing Winter Olympics Athletes’ Commission has warned competitors that they “need to be responsible” if they decide to speak out about controversial issues. Athlete freedom has been one of the hot topics before these Games, with human rights groups warning there could be consequences for talking about events in Tibet, Hong Kong and Xinjiang. However, the former speed skater Yang Yang, who won gold at the 2002 Winter Games, insisted that athletes would be free to talk in mixed zones and interviews under the IOC’s rule 50 – although podium protests would be banned.  But her words at a press conference on Wednesday were ambiguous enough that some in the audience felt she was warning athletes not to publicly criticise China’s human rights record. “We have Rule 50 from the IOC Charter,” said Yang, who is also vice-president of the World Anti-Doping Agency. “It says very clearly about the freedom of speech for athletes, what kind of expressions they can make, at what time, during what events. Athletes are role models for the world and there is a lot of attention on them. They have their opinions and if they want to share that, that is important. “There are very strict rules in the Charter. At the medal ceremonies, they cannot make their opinions but in press conferences or interviews, athletes are free to express their opinions. But athletes need to be responsible for what they say. We’ll work with the IOC and make sure that Rule 50 is strictly followed.” Yang’s comments follow others from Beijing 2022 deputy director general, Yang Shu, who said last month that athletes could be punished if their comments on human rights issues are “against the Olympic spirit, especially against Chinese laws and regulations”. Meanwhile the Olympic Games executive director, Christophe Dubi, has suggested that venues in Beijing could be between a third and a half full when the action starts on Friday. “There is going to be a scheme for spectators, which is going to be community-based, making sure we have a presence of spectators in the stands, and at the same time, having safety for all participants,” Dubi said. “In terms of capacity we are not there yet, because it has to be fine-tuned at a venue-by-venue basis, but I’d say if we have one person out of three [available spots] or out of two, that would already be a good result.”",Sport/Sport,Winter Olympians warned to be careful what they say during Beijing Games,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/01/winter-olympics-warned-careful-what-they-say-beijing-games-2022
2/1/2022,"The Professional Footballers’ Association has warned there is still much to be done to achieve parity between male and female football players, despite “significant” changes to new player contracts for the women’s game. Following 16 months of negotiations with the Football Association, agreement has been reached on the inclusion of a comprehensive Family Leave Policy, which covers maternity rights for players, improved illness and injury rights and changes to the termination period in standard contracts.  The PFA’s director of women’s football, Marie-Christine Bouchier, said that the disparity between the rights of male and female players is emblematic of a wider disparity in conditions. “Take two England internationals who play for the same club – one in the Premier League, one in the WSL,” she said. “If both those players suffer the same serious injury on the same day, under the existing WSL contract a player can be dismissed by their club if a medic thinks the injury will prevent them from playing for three consecutive months. In that instance, the player only has the right to a three-month notice of termination. “However, for the Premier League player, the injury would need to keep them out for 18 months in any consecutive 20-month period before their contract could be terminated. In that situation, they would have the right to a 12-month notice of termination.” Talks between the PFA and the FA are ongoing and Bouchier said they are confident that another issue, which allows a player’s contract to expire before the club exercises its option to retain that player, leaving them in limbo “will be remedied imminently”. She also warned that the new contracts must be implemented wholesale and not staggered in, allowing for a two-tier employment system to develop: “It is vital that the new changes are adopted by all, as opposed to being implemented on a piecemeal basis, as each player enters into a new contract.” In addition to negotiating on the standardised contracts, the union said it plans to create a Women’s Professional Football Negotiating and Consultative Committee, similar to the body which exists for male players. “Within the men’s game, the PFNCC has been integral to the development of professional football, providing football’s stakeholders with a forum to debate, agree and implement changes across the game collaboratively,” said Bouchier, who added that the lack of a football-funded pension scheme is an example of how a women’s committee could benefit progress. “Male professional players each received a pension contribution of £6,180 a season,” she said. “This benefit is funded by a levy on transfer fees from the Premier League and EFL clubs. Clearly, an equivalent process will not be sufficient in the WSL and Championship, so we need to find an alternative solution. This is something that will require a concerted, game-wide approach.” The PFA chief executive, Maheta Molango, added that the organisation, which does not currently represent Women’s Championship players, has the objective of doing so but said that “we want to reach a position of professionalisation in the Women’s Championship”, adding: “Currently, there are complexities around how the FA classifies both the league and the participating clubs that needs to be addressed. “These issues impact the contractual rights, working conditions and protections of those playing in the Championship and these will form a significant part of the ongoing discussions with the FA.”",Sport/Football,PFA warns inequalities remain between male and female players despite progress,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/01/inequalities-male-and-female-football-players-pfa-wsl
