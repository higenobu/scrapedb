4/6/2022,"Hospitals and ambulance services across England are under “enormous strain” fuelled by “heavy demand”, “severe” staff shortages and soaring Covid cases, health leaders have warned after NHS trusts covering millions of patients declared critical incidents. Dr Layla McCay, director of policy at the NHS Confederation, which represents the whole healthcare system, said the situation had become so serious that “all parts” of the health service were now becoming “weighed down”. This will have a “direct knock-on effect” on the ability of staff to tackle the care backlog, she added, as well as the current provision of urgent and emergency care. She sounded the alarm after a major ambulance trust, South Central Ambulance Service (SCAS), which covers 7 million people across Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Hampshire, Oxfordshire, Sussex and Surrey, declared a critical incident after “extreme pressures” forced it to prioritise patients with life-threatening illnesses. At the same time, six hospitals across Yorkshire issued a joint warning for people to stay away from emergency departments except for in “genuine, life-threatening situations” after a surge in numbers left some patients waiting for up to 12 hours. “With nearly 20,000 people in hospital with coronavirus in England, these latest critical incidents highlight how once again the pressure on our health service is mounting,” McCay said. “Ambulances, A&E departments and frontline providers of care across all parts of the NHS are weighed down by heavy demand. “Healthcare leaders and their exhausted teams are doing their utmost to provide patients with the treatment they require, but with 110,000 vacancies across the NHS, they also need urgent support from government to address severe workforce shortages. With one in 13 people now Covid-positive and cases still rising in older people, as we learn to ‘live with Covid’ there will be a direct knock-on effect on the NHS’s ability to tackle waiting lists.” Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, said NHS trusts “right across England” were under “enormous strain” caused by rising numbers of people with Covid-19 in hospital, a very high number of beds being occupied, staff absences and severe workforce shortages. “Trust leaders and everybody in the NHS are keenly aware of the impact of delays and addressing them is an absolute priority,” she added. SCAS declared a critical incident on Wednesday after a huge volume of callouts the previous day and asked people to only call 999 in a life-threatening or serious emergency. Mark Ainsworth, director of operations at SCAS, said: “We declared a critical incident in the early hours of the morning due to extreme pressures across our services. “This was related to the level of demand with a large volume of calls being received throughout the day and into the night, and increased challenges in releasing some of our ambulances from busy acute hospitals. This then impacts our ability to get crews back on the road to respond to patients.” Meanwhile, hospital trusts across West Yorkshire and Harrogate (in North Yorkshire) – an area covering more than 2.5 million people – said the current pressures have left them with no choice but to prioritise patients presenting with acute illness or injuries. West Yorkshire Association of Acute Trusts (WYAAT) said its most recent emergency department figures show a 14.2% increase in attendances, compared with the same week last year. Dr Andrew Lockey, emergency medicine consultant with Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust, said: “Our hospitals are extremely busy, and people are having to wait a long time to be seen. “Over the past two weeks we’ve faced huge challenges with the sharp uplift in the number of people attending accident and emergency. This places additional pressure on our teams who are responsible for treating patients with serious and life-threatening conditions.”",News/World news,NHS under ‘enormous strain’ in England as trusts declare critical incidents,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/06/nhs-enormous-strain-england-trusts-declare-critical-incidents
4/6/2022,"Three hunt supporters have been fined for public order offences after admitting clashing with saboteurs at a post-Christmas meet in Wiltshire. William Renny, 30, Callum Lewis, 26, and Evan Lorne, 18, pleaded guilty to using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause unlawful violence. All three were involved in “mayhem” outside the Red Lion pub in Lacock, Wiltshire, when the Avon Vale Hunt passed through on 27 December, Salisbury magistrates heard. The court was played video footage of the incident, which showed scuffles breaking out and punches being thrown. Tom Power, prosecuting, said: “Mr Renny threw a punch towards one of the hunt saboteurs, and Mr Lewis and Mr Lorne appear to throw punches towards the saboteurs as general scuffles break out. “The recording shows there is lots of tension in the air and the saboteurs are shouting and the defendants have been goaded.” Nicola Hutchinson, representing Renny, a pest control worker from Westbury, Wiltshire, said the atmosphere became “confrontational” when about 50 hunt saboteurs dressed in black arrived. She claimed the saboteurs approached young people on ponies and tried to spook the animals. Renny “lost his cool” and punched out at a saboteur. Rebecca Veasey, representing Lewis, a farm worker, also from Westbury, said the hunt had been a “big part” of his life but he is no longer involved with it. She told the court he accepted he aimed two “ineffectual” punches at a man who was being held against a wall. Veasey, who was also representing Lorne, an agricultural apprentice from Melksham, Wiltshire, said he got involved in the violence “out of concern” for his father, who had been pushed by a saboteur. “Mr Lorne himself was grabbed by his collar at one stage, to whom he reacted against – admittedly somewhat disproportionately.” Presiding justice Rachel Gowshall said Renny had approached his victim with “aggression” before punching him. She said: “We’ve heard there was provocation and we’ve heard there was a general melee, but you have contributed to that general melee by getting involved in violence. It would have been quite distressing for people there as bystanders watching the level of violence and mayhem.” Renny was ordered to pay a total of £677 in fines, a victim surcharge and costs. Lewis was told to pay £693 and Lorne £319. Two other defendants are due to appear at Swindon magistrates court on 13 April. Wiltshire police were criticised for their handling of the disturbance, with officers accused of not intervening to prevent the violence. Some of the saboteurs have claimed that one of the officers there is a member of the hunt. A spokesperson for the force said: “We’ve undertaken a review of our policing approach regarding this incident and, upon the conclusion of these criminal proceedings, we will publish a summary of this review.”",News/UK news,Wiltshire hunt supporters fined after admitting clashing with saboteurs,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/06/wiltshire-hunt-supporters-fined-after-admitting-clashing-with-saboteurs
4/6/2022,"At the same time as we are rightly helping another democratic country, Ukraine, defend itself against an unprovoked attack by a dictator, we have a bill going through parliament that risks seriously weakening our own democracy. The elections bill, now reaching a critical stage in the Lords, goes completely against the principle that legislation on how we vote should only be brought forward after extensive public consultation and with a high level of consensus. Instead, the bill is being rushed through with unseemly haste and, among changes that few would disagree with, contains some highly contested and partisan proposals. Take first the proposal to introduce a requirement for a mandatory photo ID before you can place your vote. The campaign group Liberty has rightly described this as “a solution in search of a problem”. The level of “personation” – casting a vote at a polling station while pretending to be someone else – is negligible. Between 2010 and 2018 there were just two convictions. The largest number of allegations in any one year was 45. This compares with a total of 58 million votes cast in 2019. The effect of introducing this photo ID, however, will be to potentially exclude nearly 2 million people from voting, mainly young people and those on low incomes. Recent research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has found that low-income potential voters are six times less likely to have a photo ID than richer potential voters. Four in 10 of those without photo IDs say that they are unlikely to apply for the free voter ID card being offered by the government. Two cross-party parliamentary committees have issued warnings about the risks of disproportionately disenfranchising groups of the electorate and upsetting the balance of our electoral system. Despite these warnings and the huge cost involved in solving a nonexistent problem, the government has ploughed on. Alongside this change, the government is also proposing – without any consultation whatsoever – to change the way we elect mayors and police and crime commissioners. Currently we use the supplementary vote system, which allows a voter to put a cross against their second preferred candidate should their first choice not be in the top two after the first round of counting. This voting system has the benefit of being much more likely to produce a “majority mandate” for the winning candidate, who will yield significant individual power. It is the system adopted for many mayoral elections in different countries, including in Ukraine. It was introduced after extensive consultation and several referendums and has been used successfully here for more than 20 years. The government now proposes to ride roughshod over previous consultation and replace this system with first past the post. It is hard to see any other reason for them doing this than perceived electoral advantage: of the 10 metro mayors (including the London mayor) that have been created, only two are Conservative. Perhaps most troubling is the government’s attack on the independence of the Electoral Commission, established to be the custodian of our electoral system. The changes would give the government greater power over the very body that sets the rules and holds all political parties, including the governing one, to account for their adherence to those rules. So serious is the concern about these changes that nine out of the 10 members of the Electoral Commission board wrote to Michael Gove saying the proposals were “inconsistent with the role that an independent electoral commission plays in a healthy democracy”. If this were to happen in any other democratic country, we would be the first to be condemning it. Entirely missing from the bill, however, is any attempt to address the issue of donations to political parties from those living overseas, or to introduce automatic voter registration, as the campaigning organisation Operation Black Vote has advocated, which would bring many more people on to the voting register. Both are urgently needed changes. It is a double irony that the unelected House of Lords is the institution with the best opportunity to challenge these unjustified and unbalanced proposals, at the report stage of the bill this evening. Needs must. Our democracy is too precious and fragile to let these pernicious changes go through without a fight. Lord Kerslake was formerly head of the civil service and permanent secretary at the Department for Communities and Local Government",Opinion/Opinion,The elections bill is an anti-democratic rush job - the Lords must take their chance to challenge it | Bob Kerslake,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/06/elections-bill-anti-democratic-lords-challenge-voters
4/6/2022,"There was a glaring reveal towards the end of Manchester City’s deserved victory over Atlético Madrid on Tuesday. With Jack Grealish on the floor Ángel Correa smashed the ball into the No 10’s face. It was on the touchline. It was right by Pep Guardiola. And Manchester City’s manager did not like it at all. So: he entered the pitch and shoved Correa. He stuck up for his player. Bravo. He might also have been booked or even sent off. But Istvan Kovacs ignored the seething 51-year-old and booked Correa. Here, though, was what poker players call the “tell” and a collector’s item as Guardiola has been über-serene recently, zen-like since around this time last season. Yes, he is still seen frantically semaphoring on the touchline or unloading the mother and father of rollockings to, say, Raheem Sterling (it is often Sterling) directly after the forward has finished the latest sublime City goal. Or giving John Stones or Aymeric Laporte an impromptu lecture on some geometric nuance of centre-back play they must apply when stepping into midfield. Yet these moments are kept to his own players. Long gone are the days when the head coach’s lack of control over his side and himself had him in curt (some might say rude) form with BBC reporter Damian Johnson following a 2-1 win over Burnley in January of his first season with City in 2017. Two weeks later came the admission that “maybe I am not good enough” for City on the eve of a 2-2- draw at Tottenham. And directly after that result he showed more prickles when another reporter from the BBC – Guy Mowbray – was challenged, oddly, that “the first question is about the referee? It’s BBC – BBC has prestige.” Guardiola has calmed since. Three Premier League titles, a record 100-points, a domestic treble and a remodelling of how the game is discharged on these shores – the goalkeeper as deep-lying schemer, for example – are prime reasons why. It meant that last year when City hit crisis point after a 1-1 draw with West Brom in December that left them trailing leaders Liverpool by eight points Guardiola’s serenity allowed him to redraw the plan (in essence, pass more, run less in possession) and a 15-match streak of victories swept his side to the championship. The sight, then, of Guardiola mixing it with Correa on Tuesday night, in a deliciously spiky Etihad Stadium atmosphere, was instructive. A manager protecting his players is how it should be and, if he went a little far, this is the Champions League quarter-finals and the stakes are sky-high. But, he should be careful. Asked about the incident later, Guardiola brushed it off while stating his players will have to be calm at Wanda Metropolitana. This applies to him, too. The sight of Guardiola, directly after his own contretemps, pulling away an upset Grealish was comical. City are currently in the most intense, zero-sum period of the Guardiola project. Following this first leg, Liverpool are Sunday’s visitors in a contest that may define the destination of the title. Jürgen Klopp’s team arrive a point behind, having played the same 30 matches. This, then, is the first of an eight-match shootout for the championship. Stones, signed by Guardiola in his first summer of 2016 and thus a veteran of successful City campaigns, is dismissive of it being decisive. “I don’t think so,” the defender says. “Obviously it’s an important game, we’re first and second in the table – everyone knows that. This week is vital for us in how we prepare and stay calm because we’ve been in situations like this before. Three years ago it came down to the last game [beating Brighton to be champions]. So we’ve been in these situations before and the experience of that time we definitely learned from.” Stones has a point but if there is a victor at the Etihad confidence and momentum levels will rocket. A second meeting with Liverpool looms in the FA Cup semi-finals a week on Saturday but before that is the return leg in Madrid. Guardiola says City go there to win despite the 1-0 advantage yet there is another intriguing stick-or-twist side plot. Diego Simeone’s side are guaranteed to use all the ploys they can. So, does Guardiola turn to his prime master of the darker arts to meet this challenge head-on? Or does he leave Fernandinho on the bench and refuse to engage how the enemy would like? As Stones says: “We knew how they’d set up and try to frustrate. I thought how we moved the ball and kept our patience during the game was key.” Patience: this is what Atlético test. Guardiola has to ensure his cracking of cool in the opener is a one-off because Simeone’s men may target his and his side’s calm again from the first whistle on Wednesday.",Sport/Football,Pep Guardiola needs to keep his cool if Atlético test City’s patience again | Jamie Jackson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/06/pep-guardiola-needs-to-keep-his-cool-if-atletico-test-citys-patience-again
4/6/2022,"Days after their daughter died in April 2018, Robert and Margaret Abrahart turned detective. “It’s a survival mechanism – we will be matter of fact, we will organise,” says Robert. “It seems the only way to cope.” The day after they were told Natasha, a student at the University of Bristol, had killed herself, they went to identify her body, then clear out her flat. That was where they found an envelope Natasha had kept containing all her online passwords. Back at home in Nottingham, they logged on to her university email account and found their daughter had told at least one member of staff she had been feeling suicidal. In the four years since, they have sought answers, culminating in a civil action against the University of Bristol, which was heard over several days last month. A judgment is still to come as to whether the university breached its legal duties to Natasha and, if so, whether this contributed to her death (requiring it to award compensation). It has been a long, expensive process – the couple crowdfunded and cashed in their pensions to pay for it – but even a successful outcome won’t feel like a victory, Margaret says, unless it starts a wider understanding of student suicide, and meaningful change across all universities. “We want universities to say, if this happened to Natasha, could it happen to anybody else? What do we need to stop it?” Natasha’s death was one of 11 suicides, or suspected suicides, at Bristol between 2016 and 2018. In 2018, the university’s vice-chancellor, Prof Hugh Brady, said: “To have a student death from any cause is a real tragedy, to have a number in quick succession really tears at the very heart of our institution and our mantra now is: mental health is everybody’s business at our university.” Natasha, 20, was extremely intelligent, loved maths and physics, and was a high-achieving student. She was close to her younger brother, had a group of friends she had known for a long time, and a boyfriend. Since childhood, she had also shown signs of social anxiety disorder: she wouldn’t talk in class, was wary of new people and even supposedly simple things, such as talking to staff in shops, she would leave to her friends. At university, her parents have since found out, Natasha would send other people to the bar to order her drinks for her. Her parents weren’t worried about her going to university because she was so self-reliant and independent. “What I hadn’t seen was that her strengths were actually connected with her social anxiety,” says Margaret, “because it meant that she didn’t have to talk to other people.” Natasha killed herself on the day she was due to give a presentation as part of her physics degree. She had found the oral assessment just about impossible, running out of one interview and missing others, which meant she was in danger of not passing the module and progressing. At an inquest into her death in 2019, the coroner concluded that gross failings amounting to neglect by Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership Trust, where Natasha had been referred after seeing a university GP, had contributed to her suicide. The inquest and the trial heard evidence that Natasha would probably have been terrified of the presentation she was due to give to students and staff in a large lecture theatre. What the Abraharts believe the inquest did not look at in enough detail was the university’s role in their daughter’s death and why – despite Natasha’s difficulties – she was not given the support she needed. Robert points out that they have ideal backgrounds to pursue such a cause – he was a professor of geography at Nottingham University, and Margaret worked in NHS mental health services. They have an understanding of both worlds. “We’re retired,” he adds. “We can spend all day on this.” They sued Bristol under the Equality Act, arguing that Natasha had been discriminated against because of her mental disabilities, and that the university could have made reasonable adjustments. “They knew there was a problem,” says Robert. “The staff in the school of physics felt unable to fix it until she jumped through the hoops.” Staff were aware since at least the previous October that Natasha struggled in oral assessments. One of the lecturers contacted the university’s disability services to get advice on what adjustments could be made, but didn’t hear back and didn’t follow it up. Natasha also contacted an administration manager at the department and told her in an email that she had been having suicidal thoughts; the manager accompanied her to an appointment with the university GP, but the inquest found no evidence that the administrator had informed the student wellbeing service about Natasha’s risk of suicide. The responsibility, Robert and Margaret allege, was all placed on Natasha to contact these services and get what she needed, including filling out a form detailing her extenuating circumstances – but with the social anxiety she was experiencing, as well as depression, her parents believe this was an impossible task. “Everybody’s trying to signpost her to places to get help, but the biggest difficulty with social anxiety is talking to people and that’s exactly what they’re recommending,” says Margaret. “She couldn’t get the doctor’s letter, couldn’t do the form filling, which they claim would have enabled them to make the adjustments,” says Robert. He believes Natasha’s difficulties were obvious, and that more allowances – such as swapping the oral presentation for a written assessment – could have been easily made. “But they decided to wait to see if she would do the necessary. Six months later, she still hasn’t done that and then she’s had six months of non-attendance, bad marks, increasing depression, and then she became suicidal.” In March 2018, Robert received a phone call from Natasha’s flatmate saying she had tried to kill herself (it later emerged this had happened some days earlier). Natasha, speaking on the phone, sounded fine, saying she felt better and wouldn’t do it again. “We wanted to pick her up straight away and she kept putting us off,” says Margaret. They made sure she made an appointment with the GP first thing the next morning. She was due to break for Easter in the coming days, but kept delaying coming home, until Margaret drove down without telling her to bring her back. “It’s difficult to know what to do,” says Robert. “You can go down and drag her away, but she’s an adult.” Natasha had seemed fine over the Easter holidays, if even quieter than usual, but when Margaret tried to talk to her about the suicide attempt she refused to discuss it. Natasha told her parents the university knew what was going on, but she didn’t tell them about the presentation she was worried about. Just over two weeks after Margaret drove Natasha back to Bristol, Natasha killed herself. What the Abraharts hope to get from their court case is “greater clarity on the Equality Act, and greater clarity on duty of care,” says Robert. It’s all very well investing in more counsellors and reducing waiting time to improve student mental health, he says, but they don’t believe that would have helped Natasha, with her particular difficulties (her boyfriend told them she had been given helpline numbers; when she called, she remained silent until they hung up). They are angry about the way, in Natasha’s case, they believe the problem was shifted to the NHS without the university reflecting on the distress they allege it was causing. “In all realms of business, people have occupational health, but we don’t seem to have that [for students],” says Margaret. “And yet everybody knows that studying is stressful. It’s about universities looking at their processes: is this safe? Is this actually the best way? Is that part of their learning? There was a school of thought that said if the students are not up to it, they shouldn’t be here.” Robert adds: “Universities aren’t an endurance test – people go there for education.” In its formal response, the university said that academic and non-academic staff tried to engage with Abrahart over alternative assessments. But it also argued that it was not reasonable to remove the use of oral assessments because it would have “compromised” Abrahart’s education. In a statement at the end of the court case, Bristol University said that “staff in the school of physics were instrumental in helping Natasha to access appropriate professional support” and that, specifically, where the presentation was concerned, “the efforts of colleagues included offering alternative options for Natasha’s assessments to alleviate the anxiety she faced about presenting her laboratory findings to her peers. These options included not taking to the stage, letting others present, and not having to answer any subsequent questions. She was reassured that she didn’t have to go ahead and could change her mind on the day of the presentation.” Beyond Natasha, the Abraharts now want to see increased protection for all vulnerable young adults, often living away from home for the first time. It could be ending things such as students being dismissed from their course by email. “You wouldn’t get that in employment,” says Robert. In July 2020, Mared Foulkes, a student at Cardiff University, took her own life after receiving an automated email saying she had failed her exams and would not be allowed to progress to the third year, though her exam result was later upgraded to a pass; in February this year, Cardiff apologised. A few days after Natasha died, another student at Bristol, Ben Murray, also took his own life. He had been told by letter and email, rather than in face-to-face meetings, that he would be removed from university after missing lectures and exams. After Murray’s death, and campaigning by his family, Bristol reviewed its dismissal process and introduced a policy where students would give consent to the university to contact their parents if there were concerns about their wellbeing. According to latest figures, 95 students died by suicide in England and Wales in the 12 months to July 2017, and the Abraharts are in touch with other families affected. Each year, says Margaret, “that’s potentially almost 100 people who may have had preventable deaths. With a lot of students, we find that they may have opted out, not fully engaged with the university over a period of time. If you can do something that catches things early on, before people make that first attempt, people are not going to get further along the line.” Without centralised monitoring, Margaret believes, it is easy for universities to view the small number of suicides at each institution as a tragic anomaly. “But if you pool all of the universities together, you can learn from each other,” she says. “And if it saves a life, it can save the distress that losing …” She pauses. “One of the things that I’ve learned is how many people are affected by suicide.” Not just Natasha’s family and friends, but the staff as well. Despite having plenty to say about the legal proceedings, Margaret and Robert find it hard to describe the impact of their daughter’s death on themselves. “Every big life event will be noticed by the fact that Natasha is not there,” says Margaret. “We’re looking at how this could have been prevented, and somehow your mind moves out from the fact that it’s actually too late. The emotional side, we’ve shelved it; we’ve focused instead on the practical things, because it’s easier.” The four-year legal battle has become, she says, “our new job, so when this goes, it’s going to be back to when she died and having to cope with that. When you stop fighting, that’s when you start grieving. So it’s quite mixed feelings.” In the UK, the youth suicide charity Papyrus can be contacted on 0800 068 4141 or by email at pat@papyrus-uk.org.
