4/10/2022,"An Illinois man is accused of burying his own mother and sister in the backyard of their home before collecting security checks for years. Michael Lelko, 45, will be formally charged with two felony counts of concealment of a death, Lyons Police Chief Thomas Herion announced this week, according to the Associated Press. The remains of Jean Lelko, 79, and Jennifer Lelko, 44, were discovered in August in the family’s suburban Chicago backyard during a welfare check, the Associated Press reports. Both were buried in plastic tubs that had been sealed with duct tape. It’s not clear how or when either died, but Michael has allegedly been cashing his mom’s monthly $1,000 Social Security checks for years. A federal investigation into that allegation is ongoing and could result in further charges. Herion stated that he could also face obstruction charges for allegedly claiming that his relatives were alive and living elsewhere. Michael’s 41-year-old brother is also in custody but has not been charged. The two siblings have allegedly stated that Jennifer had killed Jean by pushing her down the stairs in 2015. They also claim that Jennifer died from COVID-19 in 2019, before the first official case of the virus was even reported.   According to the New York Daily News, the property where the remains were found is a site exhibiting severe hoarding behavior. When officials found Jean and Jennifer’s remains last year, they noted piles of objects stacked to the ceiling of the home, feces and urines in bags and no working toilets. The Associated Press specifies some of the objects as Star Wars toys. The home was reportedly so cluttered when the remains were discovered that the brothers had taken to climbing in and out of windows to enter and exit the home. It’s not clear if either brother has an attorney.

4/10/2022,"Zelenskyy said the worst conversation he's had since the war started was with an EU politician. Zelenskyy told BILD the politician who he did not name asked him to prove the war was not staged. ""He basically said: Show us proof that all this was not staged. That your people really died."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the worst conversation he's had since the war in Ukraine started was with a European Union politician that asked him if the war was staged. ""There was a bad situation with a leading EU politician. I don't want to talk about it. He basically said: Show us proof that all this was not staged. That your people really died,"" Zelenskyy said in an interview with BILD reporter Paul Ronzheimer on Friday. Zelenskyy refused to name the politician or when exactly this conversation happened, but his remarks come after a number of atrocities across Ukraine. On Friday, two Russian rockets hit a train station in Kramatorsk, Donetsk, killing at least 50 people and injuring 100 others. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of the Donetsk region, which is a part of the Donbas region, said five of those killed were children. Zelenskyy told Ronzheimer that he doesn't think Russian President Vladimir Putin ""understands at all what is happening."" ""I'm sure he has no clue what is actually happening. He has given his order but does not know just how many people die every day and what is happening in reality. How many people, how many children die, how many buildings are destroyed, are burnt to the ground,"" Zelenskyy said. ""He doesn't know about all this and he doesn't want to know. He just needs a result."" The attack in Kramatorsk followed news that the bodies of hundreds of civilians were found in the Ukrainian suburb of Bucha. Zelenskyy told Ronzheimer that there's more destruction yet to be found. ""Some towns were destroyed completely. Some towns simply don't exist anymore – no more buildings, no more people. I do not know what we will find there,"" he said. BILD is owned by Axel Springer, Insider's parent company.
