2/14/2022,"Germany’s plans to introduce a general vaccination mandate this spring are faltering, as a growing number of politicians question if it will find a majority in parliament. The Bundestag was originally due to debate motions in favour and against mandatory vaccinations this week, after the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, indicated he considers such a step necessary to cope with a possible resurgence of the virus in the next few months.  But the timetable that was meant to see a mandate would be passed in March has already begun to slip, as a Free Democratic party (FDP) politician said his third-way motion proposing mandatory vaccinations for those aged 50 and over would be submitted with a delay. The three motions may not get their second and third reading until the end of March, when Germany’s high infection rates are forecast to be on a downward curve and the government is preparing to loosen restrictions on social gatherings and access to nonessential shops, according to reports in German media on Monday. National and state leaders are set to discuss the opening-up plan on Wednesday, as Germany’s disease control agency reported 6,465 new cases in the last 24 hours, the second consecutive day of declining incidence rates. As of Monday, almost 75% of Germany’s population had received at least two shots of vaccines, while 55% had also received a booster shot. A change of heart on behalf of the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) looks set to further stymie any law making jabs mandatory in the immediate future. The party of former chancellor Angela Merkel, now in opposition, on Friday submitted its own proposal for a tiered “vaccination mechanism” that would make jabs mandatory only if required by the severity of further variants. “Plans for a vaccination mandate from age 18 or 50 are illusory solutions that won’t find a majority in the Bundestag”, said the CDU’s health spokesperson, Tino Sorge. The leader of the CDU’s sister party in Bavaria, Markus Söder of the Christian Social Union (CSU), meanwhile, announced last week he would not enforce compulsory vaccination against Covid-19 for nursing staff in institutions such as hospitals and care homes from mid-March, as originally planned, citing fears of staff shortages as unvaccinated care workers could leave Germany’s southernmost state. With political momentum behind a swift implementation fading and the cross-party consensus on a joint motion crumbling “the general vaccination mandate is dead, at least for the foreseeable future”, wrote the Taz newspaper. Questions about the effectiveness of mandatory vaccinations are also raised by the situation in Austria, where vaccinations have been mandatory since 5 February but are not yet enforced systematically. In the mandate’s first week, 101,499 doses of vaccine where administered in the Alpine state – almost half as many as the week before. Austria’s chancellor, Karl Nehammer, said on Sunday that his government could scrap the law if its expert advisory committee decided the measure was no longer appropriate.",News/World news,Germany’s plan for vaccination mandate losing momentum,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/14/germany-plan-general-covid-vaccination-mandate-losing-momentum-bundestag-debate-march
2/14/2022,"The effort to launch an American “freedom convoy”, inspired by the Canadian truckers who have shut down parts of Ottawa for several weeks initially to protest vaccine mandates, is taking shape in a somewhat haphazard fashion.  At least three national organizations, and a constellation of regional ones, say they will depart for Washington in early March. One proposed convoy aims to leave from Fresno in California on 2 March, taking the I-10 interstate straight to the capital, where it would arrive on 6 March. “What brings us here tonight is unity, solidarity and a mindset of America,” the group’s lead organizer, Kip Coltrin, said on a conference call last week. “Obviously we have a grievance to address with our politicians, our people in Washington.” Another organization, which calls itself the“People’s Convoy”, also plans on departing in the first week of March from California. That effort is being backed by Freedom Fighter Nation, a far-right conspiracy group led by lawyer Leigh Dundas. A third group, “Convoy 4 Freedom”, is advertising its own convoy, although its size and organization appears modest in comparison to the others. The loose-knit nature of the impending protest makes it difficult to determine how many people could join, their goals and what potential there could be for disruptions. In a Facebook video, Coltrin said he has been asked just how many participants he expects to join him on the trek to Washington. “My response was to begin laughing – respectfully, of course – chuckle and say, ‘I don’t know.’” But, he insisted: “It’s going to happen. There’s no maybes.” Around the world, convoys sympathetic to the Canadian truckers, who occupied the area in front of the parliament buildings and attracted thousands of additional protesters, have formed with varying degrees of success. The motivation of the US convoys appears as fragmented as its organization. Coltrin has said their protest will be about everything from the cross-border vaccine mandates for truckers, to rising inflation, to their erroneous belief that electoral fraud cost Donald Trump his re-election. “Remember we are not only up against the government, but a $200tn big pharma industry and all its investors,” he said. Coltrin has repeatedly shared anti-vaccine misinformation on Facebook, including from the QAnon influencer Praying Medic. Coltrin said in another video: “Patriot Guard Riders, our veterans, come on guys. Three Percenters: come on, guys. Oath Keepers: come on guys.” The FBI has laid charges against a number of members of the Three Percenters and the Oath Keepers, including its leader, for their role in the January 6 insurrection. Several participants on the conference call said they were present at the Capitol that day. The “People’s Convoy” is led by Dundas, who on 6 January alleged American officials were working with foreign governments to rig the US election against Trump, and that “we would be well within our rights to take them out back and shoot them or hang them”. Despite that, she was invited by Senator Ron Johnson to speak before the Senate last month to give “a second opinion” about Covid-19. Dozens of social media pages have popped up to advertise and organize the American convoys, especially on rightwing social media platforms such as Gettr and Gab. One Facebook group intended to organize logistics and support boasts nearly 25,000 members. On Friday, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said the Department of Homeland Security is actively monitoring the possibility of a Washington-bound convoy. “They’re taking all necessary steps to ensure that the convoy does not disrupt lawful trade and transportation or interfere with federal government and law enforcement operations,” Psaki said.",News/US news,US ‘freedom convoy’ inspired by Canada bids to organize for Washington trip,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/14/us-freedom-convoy-canada-covid-vaccine
2/14/2022,"A deep split has emerged between the SNP and its coalition partners, the Scottish Greens, over Nicola Sturgeon’s decision to back the foundation of low-tax freeports in Scotland. The Scottish government signed a £52m deal with the UK government to approve two low-regulation freeports in Scotland just as Boris Johnson arrived on Monday at Rosyth in Fife, an industrial site expected to bid to host one later this year.  Ross Greer, the Scottish Greens’ finance spokesperson, said his party would have nothing to do with the schemes, in the first major split with the SNP since they struck a cooperation deal last August. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland on Monday, Greer said claims from Scottish ministers that the two projects would prioritise green, low-carbon ambitions and promote the living wage were “greenwash”. “There’s nothing genuinely green about them,” he said. “What freeports are are a really effective way to give tax relief and to throw public money at multinational companies who are already doing their best to avoid tax. “The last time the UK had freeports, according to the UK government they only created a quarter of the jobs that were promised, and that was at huge public expense. Internationally, freeports are associated with crime, money laundering, smuggling, low wages.” The Scottish government’s decision to support the freeports, despite the open hostility from one SNP minister, Ivan McKee, who originally denounced them as a “tarnished brand”, is regarded as a significant coup within the UK government. Johnson visited Rosyth and Edinburgh on Monday morning before flying to north-west England as part of a tour to promote his widely criticised levelling-up investment agenda. His visit was a rebuff to near universal demands from Scottish Tory MSPs and the Scottish party leader, Douglas Ross, in January that Johnson resign over the Downing Street parties scandal. Johnson will not meet any Scottish colleagues during his visit. Whitehall officials said the freeports proposal had gathered such significant support from Scottish ports and business leaders that Sturgeon had been forced to reluctantly abandon her initial opposition to the schemes. A number of major port operators are expected to bid, including Cromarty, north of Inverness; Forth Ports, which is likely to include Grangemouth, Rosyth and Leith ports; a joint bid from Aberdeen, Aberdeen airport and Peterhead; Cairnryan, a ferry port that links Northern Ireland to Scotland; and Clydeport. The freeports model was also denounced by SNP members at a party conference, but Kate Forbes, the Scottish finance secretary, took a more pragmatic approach to the proposals and succeeded in doubling the UK government’s funding. Michael Gove, the UK’s levelling-up minister and a Scot, agreed to fund the startup costs for both projects; the Treasury had originally said it would only pay for one. While that reduces the initial costs for the Scottish government, it will still lose business rate revenues and land and building sales taxes at the sites. Forbes told the BBC that her government had won other concessions, including an equal say with UK ministers on how the freeports are run. That meant Scottish ministers would not approve bids that failed to put forward fair work and “robust” low-carbon schemes, she said. Forbes, who confirmed that some bids would come from her constituency, declined to state that applicants would be legally forced to adopt them after winning a bid, but insisted the Scottish schemes would be fairer than England’s. “The bidder will not win without that robust decarbonisation plans. In Scotland we have a target of net zero by 2045. [We] will not support, for example, an economic initiative like this unless it helps shift the dial on net zero,” she said.",News/Politics,Scottish freeports deal splits SNP and Greens,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/14/scottish-freeports-deal-splits-snp-and-greens
2/14/2022,"“Iguess it really wasn’t a dream!” On Sunday morning VfL Bochum’s Twitter account needed to verify the reality of what had been a wonderful, surreal afternoon with a snap of the scoreboard at the 90-minute mark. Relegation favourites at the start of the campaign, surprisingly must-watch since, Thomas Reis’s team have been a tough nut to crack, especially at their atmospheric, chocolate box Ruhrstadion. Making life uncomfortable for visitors and becoming the first team to put four first-half goals past Bayern Munich since November 1975 is slightly different, however. The club’s managing director, Sebastian Schindzielorz, told Sky 90 on Sunday that the game might even surpass the ‘game of the century’ incarnation of the fixture from September 1976, when Bochum had led 4-0 against the European champions and ended up losing 6-5. “Potentially it’s a new game of the century,” said Schindzielorz. “Now we can talk about a replacement for it. It’s a game that will go down in the history books of VfL Bochum.”  Robert Lewandowski and Christopher Antwi-Adjei exchanged goals in the opening 15 minutes, a scenario that coach Reis would already have happily taken, but then Bayern were finished off by an astonishing salvo of three goals in a six-minute spell just before half-time. Jürgen Locadia gave the home side the lead by smashing a penalty past stand-in goalkeeper Sven Ulreich, right-back Cristian Gamboa thrashed a magnificent drive into the top corner after nutmegging – nutmegging! – Kingsley Coman in the build-up to his first Bundesliga goal, and then danger man Gerrit Holtmann curled a beauty around Ulreich from the edge of the penalty area. It was dizzying. The 8,500 home fans “freaked out long before the final whistle,” as WAZ’s Ralph Knight wrote on Sunday. RB Leipzig 3-1 Köln, Borussia Mönchengladbach 3-2 Augsburg, Eintracht Frankfurt 0-2 Wolfsburg, Freiburg 1-1 Mainz, Greuter Fürth 2-1 Hertha Berlin, Bochum 4-2 Bayern Munich, Bayer Leverkusen 4-2 Stuttgart, Union Berlin 0-3 Borussia Dortmund, Hoffenheim 2-0 Arminia Bielefeld “The first half was from another planet,” said Holtmann. Rejected by Werder Bremen as a youth player, able to dip a toe in the top flight with Mainz and Paderborn without really establishing himself, the now-26-year-old is having a sensational season. This was the crowning glory, with Reis’s tactics built around Holtmann’s ability to carry the ball at pace and lead counterattacks. It went so well that his picture book goal was even rattled in with his right foot, rather than his preferred left. Bochum’s bravery was something else. For what it’s worth, they were missing their own first-choice goalkeeper; Michael Esser stepped in for the excellent Manuel Riemann, who was laid low with Covid. Faced with Coman and Serge Gnabry, their full-backs Gamboa and Danilo Soares chose to fight fire with fire. The Costa Rican Gamboa’s cheeky trick on the Frenchman on the way to his goal was their attitude in microcosm. For Julian Nagelsmann, there was plenty of food for thought. He had wondered aloud whether Bayern were too open in last week’s thrilling win over Leipzig, and those fears were realised here, with the use of Thomas Müller in central midfield an attacking player too many. “They will not win the Champions League with this unconditional hooray football,” wrote Bild’s Matthias Brügelmann. Whereas Nagelsmann’s own capacity for self-reflection is in little doubt, there is increasing concern over whether he, like his predecessor Hansi Flick, might begin to question recruitment. Grad auch nochmal Videotext geguckt: War wohl wirklich kein Traum!🤩#meinVfL #BOCFCB 4:2 pic.twitter.com/YBsDzFXK0C At the end of a week in which it was announced that Niklas Süle would be joining Borussia Dortmund next season – like David Alaba, Bayern decided to assent to his wage pretentions - it is clear that the projected defensive rebuild hasn’t worked out, or not yet, at least. The leaking of stories about Süle since the announcement to justify letting him walk (including claims about his attitude and his post-Christmas weight) do not reflect well, and neither did the performance of Dayot Upamecano, who conceded the penalty by handling Holtmann’s cross and was substituted at half-time. This occasion, though, was more about celebration than analysis. Sebastian Fischer of Süddeutsche Zeitung hailed Bochum’s pre-interval flurry as “a reminder of football before the pandemic,” a return to joy. Reis may have spoken at full-time of refocussing minds to secure safety from relegation, the primary objective. But not yet, please. It’s only Monday. Dortmund recovered from last week’s beating by Leverkusen by winning 3-0 at Union, with the home side still looking a little lost up front after the abrupt exit of Max Kruse to Wolfsburg. A neatly-taken first-half double by Marco Reus laid the foundations, with the first his 150th goal for the club. The captain wasn’t in the mood to talk about the (notional) title race, though, even with BVB closing the gap on Bayern to six points. “Don’t ask the question any more, please,” he said to DAZN. Kruse continued his great (re) start at Wolfsburg, typically nerveless in notching a penalty that he won to set Florian Kohfeldt’s team on the road to victory at Eintracht Frankfurt. “In tight situations, he has a nose for what’s coming next,” said Kohfeldt of Kruse, while the striker spoke frankly of his departure from Union on Das Aktuelle Sportstudio on Saturday night. “There was no bad blood,” he said of his relationship with Union coach Urs Fischer, “but we had a different view of things one way or another.” Propelled by a back-in-form Alessane Pléa, Borussia Mönchengladbach snared a vital win over Augsburg by the odd goal in five. It was tighter than it should have been, with Alfred Finnbogason’s well-taken late consolation for the visitors fortunately too late to elicit real panic. The win – “an absolute liberation,” according to coach Adi Hütter – moved Gladbach four points ahead of the relegation playoff place. “We’re not where we want to be yet,” said Hütter, “but we withstood the pressure.” After their eye-catching performance in defeat at Bayern last week, Leipzig shone again in beating Köln 3-1, a victory even more comprehensive than it sounded and garlanded with excellent long-range hits from Christopher Nkunku and Dani Olmo. It’s looking good, with the team back in the top four and a clear path to DFB Pokal glory with much of the competition fallen by the wayside – and it has been noted locally how Domenico Tedesco has continued to be publicly demanding of his players, even after wins, in a way that Jesse Marsch seemed not to be. The prospect of next season’s second tier turning into an Avengers Endgame-type affair looms larger after further defeats for Stuttgart – 4-2 at Leverkusen – and sinking-like-a-stone Hertha, who slid to defeat at rock-bottom Greuther Fürth. Stuttgart were gutsy in their trip north, spurred on by two goals from on-loan Portuguese teenager Tiago Tomas on his first start, but ultimately trimmed apart by Leverkusen’s superior quality (Florian Wirtz again scored and assisted), with sporting director Sven Mislintat telling Sky that his side “now need to beat opponents on an equal footing” with VFB four points adrift of the playoff. Meanwhile Hertha went a goal down in Fürth to a strike from Branimir Hrgota after 26 seconds, and it rarely got much better from there despite a flurry of chances. Hrgota, one of the season’s low key stars, took his tally for the season to seven and the capital club, and their already-embattled coach Tayfun Korkut, were left to their soul searching. “We can’t do it without fighting for it,” midfielder Vladimir Darida said ominously.",Sport/Football,‘It wasn’t a dream!’: Bochum down Bayern in new ‘game of the century’ contender | Andy Brassell,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/14/bundesliga-bochum-down-bayern-munich-in-game-of-century-contender
2/14/2022,"Ihave just returned from a trip to Mexico, where I was struck by the stocks I saw simmering on every stove – broths ladled over greens and flowers, or tender offcuts of meat, or in bases of dried shrimp and seafood. In all cases, these broths were seasoned with local herbs, dried chillies and spices. Countries with deep-rooted food cultures are often skilled at celebrating the goodness in a bowl of soup. Here is one inspired by holidays in Greece.  This is similar to Greek avgolemono, which uses egg yolks to thicken and enrich the mix.

While the onion is cooking, cut the chard leaves into fine ribbons and the stalks into 2½cm pieces. Add the chopped garlic and saffron to the onions, fry, stirring, for a few minutes, then add the chickpeas and stock. Bring to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks and crushed garlic in a small bowl, then stir in the yoghurt. Add the chard stems to the soup and simmer for a few minutes. Add a ladle of the hot broth to the yoghurt, whisk to combine, then slowly whisk back into the pan. Continue cooking over a low heat for five minutes, making sure the soup doesn’t actually simmer, or the yoghurt will split. Taste and check the seasoning – it will probably need a little more salt. Stir the chard leaves into the soup and leave them to wilt while you toast the bread. Drizzle the toasts with a little olive oil, then break them up and put into hot soup bowls. Ladle the soup into the bowls, sprinkle with a little paprika, a sprinkling of grated sheep’s cheese, if using, and an extra lick of olive oil. Serve at the table with lemon wedges.

2/14/2022,"JD Sports and Footasylum have been fined almost £5m for sharing commercially sensitive information during an investigation by the UK competition watchdog, which accused them of deleting phone records, and found their chairmen to have held multiple clandestine meetings including one caught on video in a car park near Bury in Greater Manchester. JD Sports bought the trainer retailer for £90m in 2019 in a deal that was subsequently subjected to an in-depth investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority, during which time the companies were ordered to operate as separate businesses.  In November, days after the CMA ordered the deal to be unwound over competition concerns, a covert video recording emerged of the JD Sports executive chairman, Peter Cowgill, and his counterpart at Footasylum, Barry Brown, holding a meeting in a car park during the investigation period. On Monday, the CMA published the findings of a new investigation, fining the companies a combined £4.7m for holding two meetings in which they “exchanged commercially sensitive information”. “There is a black hole when it comes to the meetings. Both CEOs cannot recall crucial details about these meetings,” said Kip Meek, the chair of the CMA inquiry group. “On top of this, neither CEO or JD Sports’ general counsel can provide any documentation around the meetings – no notes, no agendas, no emails and poor phone records, some of which were deleted before they could be given to the CMA.” The CMA said it used its information-gathering powers to try to develop a “clearer picture”, including submitting legally binding requests to the companies for information, to which they did not respond in full. It said information discussed included Footasylum’s issues with stock allocations from key brands, financial performance, the planned closure of six stores, contract negotiations with its transport and delivery provider and terms regarding the renewal of its head office space. “This fine should act as a warning,” Meek said. “If you break the rules there will be serious consequences.” The CMA said it had fined JD Sports £4.3m for failure to comply with its order to operate as a separate business during its investigation. Footasylum was fined £380,000. JD Sport said that at no point did it intend to break any rules and “always acted honestly and in good faith in its efforts to comply” with the CMA. However, it did accept that “inadvertently it was in the receipt of limited commercially sensitive information and that this was not reported to the CMA immediately”. The company hit out at the CMA saying that no phone records were deleted, although it admitted some records were “not available”. It said there was no ban on the two CEOs meeting as part of the CMA’s order. It added that there was no legal requirement for it to notify the CMA of the meetings, or to take notes. “A number of the conclusions which the CMA have drawn are either incorrect or have been presented in a misleading manner through the use of inflammatory language,” the company said in a statement. “Whilst JD accepts that some phone records were not available, it absolutely refutes any allegation that this was due to records being deliberately deleted. In this regard, JD can also confirm that it voluntarily submitted all of its relevant devices to a third party for expert forensic analysis. “Ultimately, JD does not believe that the description of events or the penalty that has been levied is a fair reflection of the group’s efforts to ensure compliance with the [CMA] order.”",News/Business,JD Sports and Footasylum fined almost £5m for breaching CMA order,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/14/jd-sports-and-footasylum-fined-almost-5m-for-breaching-cma-order
2/14/2022,"My wife, Gurminder Sikand, who has died aged 61 of a cardiac arrest, was an artist whose work was characterised by images of strong women. This was true of her many self-portraits, her paintings influenced by Indian folk art, her watercolours of women hugging trees (inspired by the Chipko anti-deforestation movement), and latterly her drawings of muscular female figures whose physiques reflected Gurminder’s workouts at her city-centre gym in Nottingham. Born in Jamshedpur in India to Sohindar (nee Ohson) and Sarmukh Sikand, Gurminder spent her childhood in the hill-station of Kasauli in Himachal Pradesh. By 1970 the family had relocated to the UK, where her parents worked for the NHS. Following spells in north Wales and northern England, they finally settled in the Rhondda valley in south Wales.  After attending Tonyrefail comprehensive school, Gurminder took a foundation course at Cardiff College of Art and Design in 1979-80 and then a fine art degree at the City of Birmingham Polytechnic (now Birmingham City University), where I was studying English. In 1983, when Gurminder graduated, we moved to Nottingham. Supported by East Midlands Arts, and given opportunities by several individuals and institutions, she began to display her paintings and to hold educational events across the Midlands. An early boost came in 1984 when the South African artist Gavin Jantjes selected one of Gurminder’s paintings, Festival of Fools, as the East Midlands Arts prize-winner. That year she co-founded the Nottingham Indian Artists’ Group with Said Adrus and Sardul Gill. Among the group’s many activities was an exhibition at the Commonwealth Institute in London in 1985, the year before we married. Further recognition came when the art curator Eddie Chambers included Gurminder’s work in the catalogue for Black Art: Plotting the Course (1988), which featured her painting on its cover. Besides her involvement in many group shows, including in New York, Gurminder had solo exhibitions in a number of English cities, notably at Derby Museum and Art Gallery, Midlands Arts Centre in Birmingham and Walsall Art Museum and Gallery. Gurminder exhibited sparingly after 2000, though her commitment to her practice remained absolute. The drawings in her final show, The Weaver of Songs, at the TG Gallery in Nottingham in 2021, each took three years to produce, their surfaces scratched away and pasted over in acts of erasure and remaking. She is survived by me and our son, Nathaniel, her brother, Kulvindar, and her sister, Gurbir.",Arts/Art and design,Gurminder Sikand obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/14/gurminder-sikand-obituary
2/14/2022,"Having begun to find a rhythm to their play with style and swagger, Manchester United’s capitulation against derby rivals Manchester City was surprising. With United five points ahead of their neighbours going into the game, victory would have hugely damaged any hopes City had of Champions League football and kept them with a foot firmly in the title race. Instead, United are off the pace at the top and have City firmly on their heels. Manager Marc Skinner pointed to the reason for the underwhelming performance: “I just think Man City have a lot of experienced players who have been around this league for a long time, [whereas] we’re embedding quite a lot of players.” He’s right: the experience of winning leagues and being able to get results in high-stakes games cannot be underestimated. United held out until Caroline Weir’s stunning chip in the 81st minute. Against Arsenal the preceding week it was a sublime pass from Vivianne Miedema for Stina Blackstenius to put in that denied them all three points. United need to see out games against the WSL’s traditional top-three but that will come with time, experience and the pain of these late concessions still stinging. Now their mettle will be tested in the race for top three. SW  Match report: Manchester City 1 Manchester United 0 It’s the Ashleigh Neville show and we’re all just here to appreciate the entertainment. The right-back was again at the heart of the Spurs attack in Sunday’s 2-0 win Birmingham, this time opening the scoring with her second goal in two games, nabbed when Emily Ramsey spilled Jessica Naz’s shot. Ria Percival got Tottenham’s second goal in the 85th minute but Neville remained the standout player, as she often is. The chart of her stats this year speak for itself: Neville is in the 90th percentile for expected goals for right-backs and has similar statistical excellence for her dribbling and ball-carrying. Her efforts on Sunday mean that Spurs are back in third place – above Manchester United and very much in European contention. MN Ninth versus 10th in the league isn’t always the most exciting affair. But when it features an overhead overhead-kick assist from Jill Scott, what more can you really ask for? Everton v Aston Villa featured two teams who started dangerously close to the bottom of the league on 11 and 13 points respectively. A win either way would be pivotal and it was Villa who took the game by its lapels. They opened the scoring via Scott’s acrobatics and the finish by Emily Gielnik. Ramona Petzelbeger added to the tally, drifting in from the left to slide the ball into the far bottom corner.

Kayleigh Green, who scored twice, brought much needed attacking spark to Hope Powell’s team – who before this result hadn’t won in 11 consecutive games in all competitions. Powell has tinkered with her forward options this season and usually prefers Danielle Carter as a lone striker. With Green promoted to the starting line-up, the Wales international certainly showed why she should keep her place. “Kayleigh was very good today, she didn’t want to come off as she was on a hat-trick,” said Powell. “I thought she was outstanding. She scored two goals and they were well deserved.” RO Green is on fire! 🔥@kayleighgreen22 with the smart finish to double @BHAFCWomen’s lead! #BarclaysFAWSL pic.twitter.com/ErzQkRJUHs Lydia Bedford has changed Leicester’s fortunes after switching to three at the back when taking over from Jonathan Morgan last December. It gave them their first 3-0 victory in the WSL against West Ham, as Natasha Flint and Ashleigh Plumptre put the team 2-0 up in under 10 minutes before Freya Gregory added the third in the second half. It’s been a revelation that has allowed the team to capitalise on their counter-attacking prowess. The formation means Leicester can play to their strengths with pacy forwards who can receive quick balls from midfield and mount attacks. It certainly was a day of lucky threes for Leicester.

2/14/2022,"Hundreds of vehicles taking part in France’s so-called freedom convoy were heading for Brussels on Monday, despite warnings they would be prevented from entering the Belgian capital. The protest against Covid restrictions and high energy prices shifted its focus to the symbolic heart of the EU after police prevented most of the estimated 3,000 vehicles from entering Paris at the weekend.  About 100 managed to get past the police and converged on the Champs Élysées, where they were eventually dispersed with teargas on Saturday evening. Belgian police said they had deployed forces along several motorways and stopped about 30 vehicles heading for the capital. The mayor of the city of Brussels, Philippe Close, said police were directing vehicles to a parking and rest area just outside the city, capable of accepting up to 10,000 vehicles, and warned demonstrators this was the only place they would be allowed to converge and protest. He said protesters might be allowed to enter Brussels on foot, but they would not be allowed to “take the capital hostage”. The Brussels authorities have banned any demonstrations in the city on Monday. On Sunday night, French police warned there were about 1,300 vehicles converging on the northern city of Lille, not far from the Belgian border. The French convoy, inspired by the movement that has paralysed Ottawa in Canada, has brought together those opposed to the vaccine pass, gilets jaunes (yellow vests), and anti-government protesters angered at energy price rises. Jean-Pierre Schmit, 58, an unemployed man from Toulouse, told Agence France-Presse: “We’re going to Brussels to try and block it to fight against this policy of permanent control.” Sandrine, 45, from Lyon, added: “We’re aiming to get to all the European institutions one by one. We don’t know where this is leading, but we’re on our way and we will make ourselves heard.” The convoy was also reported to be aiming for Strasbourg, where the European parliament also sits, after Brussels. Jean-Christophe Couvy, the secretary general of the SGP police union, said the convoy appeared to have a number of “targets”. “There’s Brussels and the European parliament in Strasbourg. We have officers on standby and for the moment we’re being vigilant. We’re closely following the journey of this freedom convoy,” Couvy told FranceInfo. Officials said only about 10% of the convoy that had converged on Paris at the weekend had left for Brussels.",News/World news,French Covid ‘freedom convoy’ heads for Brussels despite police warning,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/14/french-covid-freedom-convoy-heads-for-brussels-despite-police-warning
2/14/2022,"In the late 19th-century America, a somewhat bizarre form of abstinence emerged. The vice was not alcohol but anxiety. Citizens of New York began to attend regular “Don’t Worry Clubs” in which they encouraged each other to look on the bright side of life. Their founder, Theodore Seward, argued that Americans were “slaves to the worrying habit”, which was the “enemy which destroys happiness”. It needed to be “attacked” with “resolute and persevering effort”.  By the early 20th century, the psychologist William James described how people had developed a kind of “religion of healthy-mindedness” with the aim of turning the mind away from all negative thoughts and feelings. Today, we seem to be living in a global Don’t Worry Club. Books, magazines, podcasts and TV shows frequently outline the dangers of stress. Many assume that anxious feelings are inherently and inevitably bad for us in the short and long term – and that they must be eliminated. Surprisingly enough, however, a growing body of research suggests that it is our beliefs about our feelings, as much as the feelings themselves, that determine their effects on the brain and body. Negative views of stress and anxiety often exacerbate our problems. And by learning to view these uncomfortable feelings more positively, we may even be able to use some forms of stress to our advantage. To understand how this may be so, let’s consider a concrete example. Imagine that you are facing a difficult exam or an interview that is going to determine your future career path. If you are like most people, your pulse will speed up, and your rate of breathing might increase too – and you may well assume that this stress response will damage your performance. How are you meant to concentrate, after all, if it feels as if your heart is about to break through your rib cage? Now consider an alternative possibility: the “physiological arousal” that you are experiencing is an evolved response that helps you to deal with new challenges. Heavier breathing, for example, fills your lungs with oxygen, and the racing pulse ensures that your blood can carry fuel to the brain – changes that should sharpen your thinking. Rather than attempting to suppress your feelings, you can go with the flow – knowing that they could give your performance a boost. Studies have now shown that simply presenting these facts to anxious people can help to shift their attitudes, so they no longer interpret these sensations as a sign of impending failure. And that, in turn, improves their performance on difficult challenges, such as maths tests – sometimes by a considerable margin. Apart from these cognitive changes, our attitudes to stress can also alter the way we perceive our environment, and what we learn from it. When faced with a potentially unpleasant task such as public speaking, for example, people who see stress as enhancing are more likely to focus on positive aspects of the scene before them (such as the smiling faces in a crowded room) rather than dwelling on potential signs of threat or hostility. They also become proactive – deliberately seeking feedback and searching for constructive ways to cope, rather than trying to hide from the problem at hand – and their thinking becomes more flexible and creative as a result. Our beliefs may even change our physiological responses to stressful situations. When people are taught that stress can enhance their performance and contribute to personal growth, they tend to show more muted fluctuations in the so-called “stress hormone” cortisol – just enough to keep them more alert, without putting them in a long-lasting state of panic. They also experience a sharper spike in beneficial “anabolic” hormones, such as DHEAS and testosterone, which can help repair the body’s tissues. (For people who see stress as dangerous or debilitating, there is barely any increase.) Overall, it seems that negative beliefs about anxiety and stress create a kind of vicious cycle that pushes us into ever more catastrophic ways of thinking. The result is that the body and brain start to react more and more as if they are in real physical danger and the only option is fight or flight. If we begin to see those feelings as a potential source of energy and motivation, however, we can break that cycle. There is even evidence that the way we feel about stress can influence our overall longevity. One US study tracked the health of more than 28,000 people over eight years, with questionnaires that measured people’s stress levels as well as their beliefs about the effects of that stress. Among people with high levels, those with the negative views were considerably more likely to die than those who believed that stress was harmless. Importantly, this was true even when the scientists controlled for a host of other lifestyle factors, such as income, education, physical activity and smoking. It’s important to be careful when interpreting correlational findings like this. But given the experimental work showing that worrying about stress results in a worse physiological response in the moment, it’s plausible that the effects could add up over time to influence long-term health. It’s not necessarily easy to pull off this shift in attitude, of course. Western culture generally teaches us to get stressed about stress – and the habit can become deeply ingrained. This is not about “toughing it out”, which, if you’re struggling to cope, can be a recipe for disaster. Nor is it about learning to simply put up with unacceptable workloads or damaging relationships. But as you encounter some of life’s smaller challenges, consider whether you might begin to view your anxiety a little more kindly, as a potential source of energy and resilience. To misquote Shakespeare’s Hamlet, stress may be neither good nor bad – but thinking makes it so.
