4/2/2022,"China launched cyber-attacks on Ukrainian military and nuclear targets shortly before the Russian invasion, according to a report. The UK government confirmed that the National Cyber Security Centre is investigating the allegations, which claim that more than 600 websites, including Ukraine’s defence ministry, were subjected to thousands of hacking attempts coordinated by the Chinese government. A UK government spokesperson said: “The National Cyber Security Centre is investigating these allegations with our international partners.” The claims are based on intelligence memos obtained by the Times. Ukraine’s security service, the SBU, alleges that China appears to have had advance notice of the invasion because the hacking attempts started before the end of the Winter Olympics in Beijing and peaked on 23 February, the day before Russia invaded its neighbour. The SBU said other targets of the attacks included border defence forces and the national bank. The attempts were designed to steal data and explore ways to disrupt or shut down defence and civilian infrastructure, the SBU added. Although Russia is believed to have been behind a number of cyber-attacks on Ukraine in the run-up to the conflict, the SBU said it had also detected hacks that bear the hallmarks of the cyberwarfare unit of the People’s Liberation Army. The SBU said it had seen an increase in computer network exploitation (CNE) attacks, used for reconnaissance and espionage. The Times said the SBU had provided a series of intelligence memos, thought to be prepared by another country, that detailed the scale of the hacking and included nuclear targets. “Intrusions that are of particular concern include the CNE campaigns directed at the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate, and the Ukrainian Investigation Website focused on Hazardous Waste,” read one memo. “This particular CNE attack by the Chinese cyberprogramme included the launch of thousands of exploits with attempts pointed to at least 20 distinct vulnerabilities.” On 18 March the US president, Joe Biden, warned his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, of “consequences” if China provided material support to Russia during the invasion. Xi and Vladimir Putin met in Beijing at the start of the Winter Olympics in February and issued a joint statement saying the bonds between the two countries had “no limits”. Xi and Putin also made clear in the statement that they opposed any further expansion of Nato. Soon afterwards, according to the SBU, there was an increase in CNE attacks on Ukrainian targets.",News/Technology,China accused of launching cyber-attacks on Ukraine before Russian invasion ,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/01/china-accused-of-launching-cyber-attacks-on-ukraine-before-russian-invasion
4/2/2022,"Leeds’ miserable start to the new Super League season continued with a sixth defeat in seven games, the latest a chastening loss to a St Helens side which, in truth, barely had to get out of second gear to inflict more misery on the Rhinos. On the hunt for a new coach after Richard Agar’s departure last week, Leeds have now suffered two comprehensive defeats since Jamie Jones-Buchanan took interim charge. Here, there was certainly no shortage of endeavour but a clear lack of any offensive guile or structure whatsoever as Leeds were nilled against the reigning champions. On a night when James Roby celebrated his 500th appearance for the club, the Saints were simply too good without ever really getting anywhere near the level we are used to seeing from Kristian Woolf’s side. Leeds spurned several gilt-edged opportunities in attack but the Saints’ defence was simply too strong and too resolute for a Rhinos side who appear to be in real trouble at the foot of the table. The writing appeared ominously on the wall for the Rhinos after just five minutes when they fell behind to an early try. In a cruel twist of fate for the home supporters it was one of the most popular Leeds players of recent years who broke the deadlock, as Konrad Hurrell marked his return to Headingley by barging his way over from close range to put St Helens ahead. At that stage, you feared the worst for Leeds, but their defensive effort was commendable, not least given their recent form. Time and time again they kept the Saints at bay but when the hosts had to endure four successive sets on their own line, you felt the dam would burst. That moment duly arrived when Lewis Dodd and Jack Welsby combined to send Tommy Makinson over, though Makinson was wide with both conversions, meaning the Saints led by only eight. That meant Leeds were very much in the game, but at the other end, any time they found their way into St Helens territory, they were denied by a combination of spirited defensive efforts from the visitors, and poor last-play options on their own behalf. On four separate occasions they failed to kick on the last tackle, cheaply turning the ball over in prime attacking position. Then, with three minutes to the break, Blake Austin opted to kick on the first with none of his Leeds teammates in support. It meant that for the third successive home game, the Rhinos had failed to score a single point in the first half. There was certainly no doubting Leeds’ effort. But the early stages of the second half were a repeat of large periods of the first, with immense pressure on the St Helens line ultimately coming to nothing. Liam Tindall was bundled into touch on the first tackle of a fresh set as the Rhinos failed to hold their nerve, clearly pushing for a play to break through a resolute St Helens line that was looking increasingly less likely to be broken. An obstruction from Rhyse Martin then prevented Jack Walker’s try from being allowed and as Leeds continued to push, they were punished in devastating fashion in three momentum-swinging minutes. A desperate last-ditch pass from Liam Sutcliffe was intercepted by Makinson, who raced the length of the field to suck any intensity out of the home side before on the following set, they broke instinctively down the left to allow Lewis Dodd to cross. Suddenly it was 20-0 and, realistically, game over. St Helens weren’t done either. Their fifth try was arguably the best of the night, as Jonny Lomax collected his own kick to cross unchallenged, with Mark Percival’s goal making it 26-0. The only question left was whether Leeds could avoid the ignominy of being nilled. Perhaps unsurprisingly, that question was emphatically answered in the final moments with yet more resolute defending from the visitors and, unfortunately, more attacking play from the hosts which will leave all Leeds fans worried about where their club heads next.

4/2/2022,"The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, has pressed ahead with the appointment of former Tory parliamentary candidate Orlando Fraser to chair the Charity Commission, despite his rejection by an MPs’ scrutiny committee. The news that Dorries had ignored the cross-party group of MPs to appoint Fraser was slipped out in a brief statement by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) early on Friday evening. The select committee said in its pre-appointment scrutiny report this week it could not endorse ministers’ “slapdash and unimaginative choice” of Fraser for the £62,000 a year job as head of the charities regulator in England. But ministers indicated they “respectfully disagree” with the committee’s views, emphasising MPs do not have a right of veto over the post. They consider MPs had done a disservice to what they view as Fraser’s strengths. The committee chair, Tory MP Julian Knight, said that Fraser’s swift endorsement, and that of the new Ofcom chair, Michael Grade, who the committee had also expressed reservations about, showed the public appointments process was “broken”. The National Council for Voluntary Organisations called Fraser’s appointment disappointing. “The government must look again at this process and work to ensure that future chairs have the backing of parliament,” it said. It is the second time in a row that the government has ignored the wishes of parliament in selecting the commission chair, a post seen by some ministers as a key appointment in the context of their pursuit of “anti-woke” culture wars. In 2018 the then culture secretary Matt Hancock overrode the DCMS committee when it rejected the appointment of Tory peer Lady Stowell on the grounds she had no experience and lacked “real insight, knowledge or vision”. Stowell subsequently proved unpopular with the charity sector, which felt she unfairly targeted campaigning charities. Stowell said charities that pursued “politically contentious” issues could expect scrutiny from the commission, even if they acted within the law. After a spate of controversies in which the likes of the National Trust and Barnardo’s were investigated – and cleared – by the commission, the previous culture secretary Oliver Dowden said last year the regulator’s next chair should be prepared to pursue charities which stray into so-called “woke” and “political” activities. Fraser was clear in his appearance before the committee last month that he would be independent of government, and not allow the regulator to be dragged into media and government-led “culture wars”. He told MPs: “We will not be an arm of government in any way at all about that kind of issue. All we will ever do is look at the facts and decide the facts based on charity law.” The DCMS committee said on Thursday it had no grounds for concern about Fraser as an individual – it described him as “likely competent” – but had serious reservations about the selection process, including the lack of diversity in the shortlist. Fraser was not the government’s first choice after being interviewed for the £62,000-a-year job in the autumn. However, he was shortlisted, and when the preferred candidate, Martin Thomas, quit the post days after being approved by the committee in December, Fraser was invited to step in. The committee was keen that the appointment process be re-run, not least to ensure that potential candidates could be drawn from wider and more diverse backgrounds. Ministers had also indicated at the time that they had been disappointed at the lack of diversity. Educated at a private school and Cambridge University, Fraser is a white, upper middle-class barrister. He is the son of the late Tory MP Sir Hugh Fraser and the writer Lady Antonia Fraser. His grandfather was the Labour peer Lord Longford. Fraser, who stood unsuccessfully as a Tory candidate in North Devon in the 2005 general election, told MPs had not been involved in party politics for many years. He spent four years on the board of the commission from 2013 to 2017, during which the regulator was criticised for becoming “politicised”.",News/Society,Nadine Dorries hands top charity role to candidate rejected by MPs,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/01/nadine-dorries-hands-top-charity-role-to-candidate-rejected-by-mps
