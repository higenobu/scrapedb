5/15/2022,"Nearly 90 days into Vladimir Putin’s “special military operation” in Ukraine, Russian troops have apparently become so demoralized and desperate to quit they’ve begun deliberately injuring themselves. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s Main Intelligence Directorate on Saturday released audio of what it said was an intercepted call revealing the batshit new trend. A man identified as a Russian soldier in an air assault brigade based in Ukraine’s Kherson region can be heard venting his frustrations to his mother and explaining why he wants to abandon the fight. “Why would they [the Ukrainians] surrender? We’re on their land,” the soldier tells his mother. “This won’t end anytime soon. What the hell do I need this for? At 20 years old… I’m not at all interested in Ukraine. I need to come back and resign,” he says. His astonished mother asks why there are no Russian troops in Ukraine determined to continue the fight for the sake of “patriotism,” but the soldier, Nikita, just scoffs. “I had a commander… who shot himself in the leg just to get out of here. And that was in the very beginning! What is there to talk about? He served in Chechnya.” His shocked mother goes on to argue that someone must “defend Russia” to stop the West from attacking, echoing the Kremlin narrative dominant on Russia’s state-controlled news that Putin’s war was launched to stop an imminent NATO assault. “They will just kill us all, it’ll be World War Four and Russia will lose!” she declares. “Well, then Putin will maybe change his mind… There are no people, there’s no ammunition,” he said, adding that his own commander had sent letters trying to get his brigade pulled out, to no avail. Russian President Vladimir Putin. He said less than 50 percent of his brigade was left. “Our people are just disappearing on their own. Some of them vanished without a trace, some were taken prisoner, some are hiding, some are already in Russia,” he said. The tapped phone chat was not the only one to suggest Russian troops are taking desperate measures to escape the war. In a similar recording released by Ukrainian intelligence Friday, a woman identified as the wife of a Russian soldier urges him to “fall off a tank.” “There’s no way out,” she says. “Otherwise you will be there until September… They will not swap you out, because everyone is refusing.” “Well, clearly, what kind of stupid fuck would come here?” he says. His wife argues a “fall from a tank” is just one option. “You just don’t need to shoot yourself in the leg, because who the fuck knows how that would end. Or let someone whack you on your side,” she says, so that his kidneys would get injured. “I don’t fucking know! Because you’d be able to go home straight from the hospital.” The purported soldier appears to seriously consider the proposal as he recalls how he and about 300 other troops took control of a village two days earlier, when he says a “fucker of a battalion commander” ordered all the men to toss grenades into the basements of local homes, without checking who was inside first. “It’s good that they didn’t fucking toss the grenades, because when the guys went in there were four little kids sitting there.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

Their wives are becoming audibly afraid of the kind of people their husbands are turning into. “I can take a person and then ‘bam’ – (shoot them) in the head, from a machine gun, or a Kalashnikov (assault rifle), mowing down a hundred people in one go,” the soldier can be heard saying in the recording.

5/15/2022,"By Mark Trevelyan LONDON (Reuters) -Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Saturday that Moscow was the target of ""total hybrid war"" by the West but would withstand sanctions by forging deeper partnerships with China, India and others. In a speech on the 80th day since Russia invaded Ukraine, Lavrov pointed to the barrage of sanctions imposed by the West in an effort to portray Russia as the target, not the perpetrator, of aggression. ""The collective West has declared total hybrid war on us and it is hard to predict how long all this will last but it is clear the consequences will be felt by everyone, without exception,"" he said. ""We did everything to avoid a direct clash - but now that the challenge has been thrown down, we of course accept it. We are no strangers to sanctions: they were almost always there in one form or another."" The sanctions on Russia's top companies, banks and political elite have been imposed to punish it for a war that has killed tens of thousands of people and uprooted millions, disrupted energy markets and exacerbated a global food crisis by driving up prices for grain, cooking oils and fertiliser. In his speech, Lavrov laid out the strategy that Moscow is pinning its hopes on as it tries to cushion the hit to its economy and build new markets elsewhere. He cited the sanctions, which have included the seizure of nearly half of Russia's $640 billion in foreign reserves, as evidence that no one is safe against expropriation and ""state piracy"", and of the need for countries to lessen economic reliance on the United States and its allies. ""Not only Russia but many others too are reducing dependence on the U.S. dollar, western technology and markets,"" he said, without stating evidence. Efforts by the West to isolate Russia were doomed to fail, he said. Russia's relations with China were the best they had ever been and it was developing a privileged strategic partnership with India. Just back from a trip to the Middle East, he also cited the importance of ties with Egypt, Algeria and Gulf nations, as well as Asia, Africa and Latin America. In one example of a sanctions-induced pivot in exports, Russia sold twice as much crude oil to India in the two months after its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine as it did in all of 2021, as Western nations cut purchases of Russian oil and Indian refiners seized the chance to buy it at a discount. Yet despite Russia's insistence it can thrive under sanctions, its economy is on track to shrink by somewhere between 8.8% and 12.4%, according to an economy ministry document seen by Reuters, and not return to its pre-invasion size before 2026. Annual consumer inflation accelerated in April to 17.83%, its highest since 2002.

5/15/2022,"STORY: Russian President Vladimir Putin told his Finnish counterpart Sauli Niinisto on Saturday (May 14) that ditching neutrality and joining NATO would be a mistake that could damage relations between their two countries. That's according to the Kremlin. The two countries said the presidents spoke by phone two days after Finland declared its intention to join the Western alliance. Moscow has described that as a security threat that will require it to respond. But has not specified how. Niinisto's office said he told Putin that Russia's demands in late 2021 aimed at preventing countries from joining NATO, and its February invasion of Ukraine, have ""altered the security environment of Finland."" It added that Finland wanted to handle relations with its Russian neighbor in a ""correct and professional manner."" Moscow described the call as a ""frank exchange of views,"" normally a diplomatic euphemism for a difficult conversation. Finland's membership bid is expected to be followed by a similar move from Sweden. That confronts Putin with exactly what he said he wanted to avoid when he launched what Moscow calls a ""special military operation"" - a further expansion of NATO to Russia's borders.",Politics/Reuters Videos,Putin tells Finland joining NATO is a mistake,https://news.yahoo.com/putin-tells-finland-joining-nato-152745746.html

Finnish President Sauli Niinistö initiated a phone call with Russia's Vladimir Putin on Saturday, telling the Russian president that Finland will be seeking membership to join NATO.

According to the press release, Niinistö reminded Putin that ""every independent nation maximizes its security."" The release continued: ""This is what is happening now, too.

The NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg responded by saying Finland would be ""warmly welcomed into NATO."" In his call with Putin, the Finnish president also ""repeated his deep concern over the human suffering caused by the war Russia wages in Ukraine,"" according to the press release.
