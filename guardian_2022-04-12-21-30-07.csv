4/12/2022,"There are certain phrases that deserve a nod of recognition when they prove to be literally true: anyone who’s ever dug such a big hole that they hit the rock bottom will know what I’m talking about. Or if you’ve ever stood at a ferry terminal realising that you have, in fact, missed the boat. Perhaps this Easter you will unpack your shopping, covered in a slimy, clear film, and understand the error of putting all your eggs in one basket. Personally, I have found myself swimming through actual shit. Not just once, either. Not by a long chalk. Over the past 37 years, I have probably swum through enough sewage to fill a river. Because, you see, it does fill our rivers. And seas. And lakes. And the little streams that snake behind housing estates, and the pools that have the audacity to sit beside poorly maintained pipes. Such is the problem that you would be hard pressed to find any body of water in Britain that a privatised water company hasn’t flushed with turds now and again in the quest for ever-greater profits. All this, of course, is made possible by the particular shrug-it-off brand of Conservativism we are living under that makes everything from environmental damage to tax avoidance just another thing for those in power to turn a blind eye to, as they cut their mates some slack, feather their own nests and sit dreaming of the statues and headed notepaper that are all they really went into politics for in the first place. On 23 April, Surfers Against Sewage is joining forces with campaign groups all over the country for a day of action, demanding an end to sewage pollution. According to Surfers Against Sewage, in 2020 alone, sewage was released into the environment more than 400,000 times, equating to 3.1m hours of discharge. There really is something particularly unpleasant about the phrase “3.1 million hours of discharge”, isn’t there? Only 14% of UK rivers meet “good ecological status” under the EU’s water framework directive, and the UK is ranked last in Europe for bathing water quality. And yet, bathe we do. At least I do. And thousands of other dimple-skinned women I see with swimming costumes, dry robes, flasks and chattering teeth every week, scattered along the riverbank or edge of a lake or pebble beach. I once swam in the Thames. The actual big daddy in London. Joining a group of swimmers and the artist Amy Sharrocks, I slapped bare feet down a stone cutaway and into the river at Hammersmith. It felt particularly bizarre to be doing something as bucolic as swimming while passing bin lorries, City of London parking meters and saddle cranes. Most Londoners consider the Thames a kind of wet motorway full of rusty chains that runs through the city. We don’t think of it as a river at all. But it is a river. And, as illicit and counterintuitive as it feels, you can swim in it (in certain places and with the right permission). It is also, I should say, pretty filthy. During my short swim I caught a plant pot on one hand, was smacked in the neck by a plank of wood and got an empty crisp packet stuck to my face. But it’s not often litter that will make you ill. It’s the slurry. The raw, untreated litres of liquid poo that water companies frequently pump out into our rivers under the guise of flood drainage. You may remember the 2bn litres of raw sewage dumped in the Thames over just two days back in October 2020. Or more likely you don’t, because the companies that sweep the crap and condoms and wet wipes into our rivers don’t tend to advertise the fact that they have just turned your local waterway into an open sewer. But it happens. It happens all the time. You may not be a swimmer; you may not see the sea from one year to the next; you might find your pleasure in leisure centres rather than lakes. But when faced with corporate negligence, political villainy, environmental destruction and personal illness, we, as a nation, do not have to go with the flow.

4/12/2022,"Long thought lost, this beautifully minimalist film made in 1990 records the first on stage reunion of former bandmates Lou Reed and John Cale, co-founders of the immortal 1960s band the Velvet Underground, as they perform, without an audience, their Songs for Drella album at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Mostly the songs channel the voice of Andy Warhol, the Velvets’ former manager and producer (although the band dispute how much input he really had), who had died three years earlier. Indeed, Cale and Reed first conceived of this project at Warhol’s memorial service, where they ran into each after a long estrangement. Out of that encounter came a remarkable, acclaimed album and, tangentially, this film, previously only available on VHS and LaserDisc. The negative was thought lost but it turns out it was only mislaid; director-cinematographer Ed Lachman found the 16mm negative in the proverbial attic while working with Todd Haynes on the latter’s documentary about the Velvet Underground, which came out last year. The whole thing is about memory and recovery in a very literal sense. The songs themselves, showcased beautifully here, must be some of the most scaldingly honest eulogies in the history of pop music, capturing as they do the many sides of Warhol, not all of them nice. The ambivalence is right there in the title, drawing on the inner circle’s nickname for Warhol (Drella = Dracula + Cinderella). It was a handle Warhol himself disliked but one that captures what frenemies like Cale and Reed considered his vampirish relationship to others. It Wasn’t Me, for instance, implicitly castigates Warhol’s refusal to take any responsibility for those churned up in his Factory’s wake, felled by suicide or overdoses. And yet Cale and Reed also sing in their own voices, shifting perspectives to say goodbye to an irreplaceable figure in their lives they also admired and at one point loved. Don’t expect any tears, of course: both men seem stoic, controlled and tense throughout this charged performance. They lock eyes with each other to make sure they’re literally in sync; not out of shared pain or friendship or anything wet like that. As one song quotes Warhol: “All that matters is work.”  Songs for Drella is available on 17 April on Mubi.",Arts/Film,Songs for Drella review – surprisingly moving journey into Warhol,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/12/songs-for-drella-review-surprisingly-moving-journey-into-warhol
4/12/2022,"The Metropolitan police may have missed a chance to bring charges over a series of alleged assaults by the same man, several women have told the Guardian. The women made statements to the Met and allege the force mishandled their claims about Hubert Greliak, who they claim may be a serial attacker. He was convicted in January of rape against one woman and will be sentenced on Tuesday for that attack. The woman in that case, Juliana Terlizzi, 34, has waived her right to legal anonymity. She tracked down other women through social media who made claims against Greliak stretching over 11 years. After Greliak was arrested in March 2020 for the attack on Terlizzi, at least two more women came forward and made statements to the police. One said she had been put off after her contact with the Met. Another said police just seemed to give up on her case, with one officer making a remark she found offensive. They say Greliak could receive a shorter jail sentence than had the claims been investigated properly and potential other charges been put before the court. They fear Greliak may remain a danger to women after his release from prison. The Met said it handled the case properly and urged women to come forward. The force said it was “absolutely dedicated to achieving criminal justice outcomes for victim-survivors”. Police said they received one other complaint against Greliak, which was investigated and did not lead to charges. A solicitor for Greliak said he could not comment because his client was in jail awaiting sentence and so could not be reached. The Met has been under fire for how it handles crimes against women, especially rape. A report last year by the victims’ commissioner for London, Claire Waxman, found nearly two-thirds of rape victims in London (which is covered by the Met) who dropped their complaint, did so within a month of going to police, with the proportion tripling in two years. At the time Terlizzi was attacked in February 2020, she was in a relationship with Greliak. She said he drugged her, and he was convicted at Isleworth crown court for then raping her and filming the attack. He was also convicted for assault by penetration, theft, and refusing to give the passcode to his phone. During the attack, with Terlizzi unconscious, he said: “I’m completely raping you …” As her case progressed Terlizzi became convinced her attacker was breaching his bail conditions, but said police did not take her seriously: “They said I was overreacting, overthinking things. They said I should go to the doctor and get medication.” It turned out Terlizzi was right, and Greliak ended up having his bail revoked for breaching it. Terlizzi said she was asked to give detectives access to her phones, computers and social media: “The police treated me as a suspect and made it almost unbearable for me to support the case moving forward. It was almost as if they wanted me to give up and drop the case, which had a huge impact on my mental health.” Terlizzi spoke to Greliak’s past girlfriends and partners and found 10 others who she said complained about his behaviour, allegations ranging from rape, to assault, to controlling and abusive behaviour. One woman who alleges she was raped during a five-year relationship with Greliak says police mishandled her case. Kate (not her real name) came forward to support Terlizzi’s case and said she still had nightmares and had not told her family what happened. Kate said: “I thought that he had only got worse while he was with me and that maybe even part of it was actually my fault, that I had enabled him and allowed him to get worse. I considered it important to report my experience too, and finally cut ties with him once and for all.” She added that she did not believe “a person like this” would “stop abusing women of his own accord”. She said: “I found it extremely hard to get myself around to report my experience, as I have no proof of what he did to me over the five years we were together. I didn’t know what domestic rape was, and had serious doubts about what constitutes emotional and even physical abuse …” She said she filed an online report to police and was shocked and embarrassed when police turned up at the temporary accommodation where she was staying. “Overall, I felt the police handling of the case was tactless, I especially feel they didn’t realise the shame it would bring me the fact that they showed up at my Airbnb and that therefore I didn’t have any privacy to talk about my report.” Rose (not her real name), alleged she was sexually assaulted in a London bar and made a statement to police. Her identity was relayed to Greliak by police in interview – normal police procedure so he could respond – and he denied everything. Rose said she was hurt when one officer said: “At least he knows how you feel.” Rose said: “My only intention was to report the truth of what had happened in order to protect others.” She said Greliak had once said to her: “You look so hot I could rape you.” Greliak is in prison awaiting sentencing on Tuesday. Terlizzi said she feared he would spend only a few years in jail and emerge as a continued threat to women: “As it stands, Greliak was only prosecuted and convicted for the crimes he committed in relation to me. I have no doubt Greliak will reoffend and I worry for my safety and that of other women when he is released from jail.” The Met initially said no other women had made allegations of criminal offences against Greliak. It later revised its statement and said: “As part of the wider investigation officers approached a number of individuals in relation to Greliak’s behaviour. On 23 May 2020, the [Met] received one allegation of sexual assault that was alleged to have taken place in 2012. The allegation was investigated and the case discontinued with no further action. “We can assure survivors that any allegation will be taken seriously and you will be fully supported. We are committed to tackling all forms of violence against women and girls and are absolutely dedicated to achieving criminal justice outcomes for victim-survivors.”",News/Society,Women accuse Met of missing chances to charge alleged serial attacker,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/12/women-accuse-met-missing-chances-charge-alleged-serial-attacker
4/12/2022,"A pro-Russian cavalcade in Dublin led by a car with the Z symbol has provoked astonishment and condemnation in Ireland. About 10 cars with Russian and Irish flags drove in a convoy down the M50 motorway last Sunday afternoon in an apparent display of support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The bonnet of the lead vehicle, a green Jeep, bore the Z symbol that Russian forces use in Ukraine. The rally is believed to have been organised through a private Facebook group for Russians living in Ireland. Pro-Russia rallies were held in Germany on the same day, including a motorcade rally in Hanover.

The embassy said Z symbolised killings and atrocities and should be banned. The cavalcade occurred three days after Irish legislators gave a standing ovation to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who thanked Ireland for its support for Ukraine in a video address to both chambers of parliament.

4/12/2022,"Welcome to Pushing Buttons, the Guardian’s gaming newsletter. If you’d like to receive it in your inbox every week, just pop your email in below – and check your inbox (and spam) for the confirmation email. I spent the latter half of last week in London for the Bafta Games Awards – a ceremony whose existence still seems to surprise people, despite the fact that they’ve been running in some form for 18 years. I suppose it doesn’t help that the institution is literally called the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, but video games are a big deal at the UK’s prestigious arts organisation, more so now than ever. (Full disclosure: I’ve been involved on and off with the video game Baftas for years, as a juror or an adviser. It’s never been a paid thing, though I have eaten a shameful number of cocktail sausages during jury deliberations.) Few people outside the entertainment industry really care about awards, unless somebody famous throws an unexpected slap. There was no surprise violence last Thursday night, but nonetheless, the Baftas were worth paying attention to because of the diversity of the nominees and winners (and presenters – it is great to see a games industry event that actually reflects the makeup of the people who play games, which is pretty much everyone). A lot of awards end up highlighting what’s been most popular and successful as opposed to what’s been most interesting or worthy, because the voting systems involve huge pools of people. But the Bafta juries are smaller, and comprise a mix of developers, critics and other people involved in the video games industry, and so the shortlists are pleasingly unpredictable. You get something like remote-control car football game Rocket League winning five awards in 2016, beating everything from Destiny to Fifa. This year The Artful Escape, an intergalactic prog-rock adventure, beat Resident Evil to win Artistic Achievement. These awards presumably mean a lot to most people involved in making games, but when a small team wins, they seem especially delighted and overwhelmed. This year, a delightful black and white indie photography game called TOEM won Debut Game, and the entire team got up on stage to collect it, which was only 8 people. One of the big winners of the night was Unpacking, the meditative house-moving simulator, which won Best Narrative and the audience-voted game of the year award. That game was made by a wee team in Australia, two of whom are in a relationship that partially inspired the game. They were absolutely flabbergasted and it was adorable. Unlike in the film world, people who work in video games tend to be genuinely invested in each other’s success. Games are still culturally undervalued – though less so with every passing year – and so a victory for a single game feels like a victory for everyone. The acceptance speeches reflect this – mostly everyone just expresses amazement that they could have won against everything else in their category. Shout-out to the exuberant It Takes Two creative director Josef Fares, though, who bounced on stage to collect the Multiplayer award and said something along the lines of “I’d pretend to be surprised but actually this one was definitely expected!” Science-fiction shooter Returnal won four awards, the most of any game, including Best Game and Performer in a Leading Role. This pleased me because a) I personally adore that game, even though 2021 was a tough year to be playing a time-loop shooter about being unable to escape from a hostile alien planet, and b) its lead character Selene is a badass middle-aged single mother, and lord knows we do not play enough games starring fed-up tough-as-nails women. This is the equivalent of the arthouse Oscar winner I reckon; it might not be for everyone, as it’s pretty challenging, but if you do vibe with it, you will love it a lot. The Bafta awards reminded me that though 2021 was a weird year for games, it was also an interesting one: several big names that I was looking forward to were either delayed or turned out to be disappointing, but that left room for more left-field contenders to steal the stage. A few more recommendations from the shortlist, if you haven’t gotten around to them yet: Psychonauts 2, a surreal comedy platformer about diving into people’s psyches; Before Your Eyes, a fascinating game about replaying moments in a person’s troubled but beautiful life (you can control it by blinking!); and Chicory: A Colourful Tale, winner of the Family category, a touching and vibrant puzzle game that hit me unexpectedly hard in the feelings. Oh, and I’ve finally started Inscryption, the Game Design winner, which people have been recommending to me for ages: I’ve been told to expect nothing but the unexpected. I suspect I’ll come back next week fully obsessed with it. Kirby has always been among Nintendo’s least-loved mascots, I feel. Even Luigi stepped out of Mario’s shadow in the excellent comedy-horror Luigi’s Mansion series, but apart from the years I spent absolutely dominating everyone with Kirby in Super Smash Bros on the N64, I’ve never had much of a reason to really love this weird pink blob. His main “thing” is that he eats enemies and gains their powers, but Mario is a better transforming game character in Super Mario Odyssey, imo. So I am surprised by how much I’m enjoying Kirby and the Forgotten Land. You know why? It’s weird. It’s weird and kinda dark. Instead of floating through unbearably saccharine levels that look like murals in a high-end nursery, we prance and transform and bounce about in what is clearly the abandoned ruins of Earth. I’ve not finished it yet so I don’t know if this is ever explained, but the wry juxtaposition of something as cute as Kirby with something as un-cute as a post-apocalyptic city is really doing something for me.

Like Patrick, I’ve kind of grown up within and alongside the games industry; at this point I’ve been doing this job for more than half my life. His article made me quite emotional.

What games released in the last year or so don’t beat the player into submission or require genius-level intellect?” As is probably obvious if you’ve been reading this newsletter for a while, I have a bit of a weakness for games that give me a hard time – but I also never have enough spare time for those exact games, so I also play things with much chiller vibes. Here are a few from 2021/22 that spring to mind: Dorfromantik, a game about building idyllic little villages; Chicory: A Colourful Tale and Unpacking, which I mentioned above; Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is a total player-centric delight of an action game; the Forza Horizon series is just a big holiday; Life is Strange: True Colours has a decent story that didn’t require hours of suffering or effort to access.

4/12/2022,"The superhero genre needs to shake itself up. We’ve spent the last decade and a half being told the same handful of tales. We know the origin stories. We know that all the superheroes are contractually obliged to join forces, like a cover of We Are the World performed by people in funny costumes. What we need is something new. Perhaps that thing is The Superhero Complex. The new podcast is part investigation and part character-study about a scarcely believable figure, Phoenix Jones, a man who bills himself as a real-life superhero. Jones – real name Benjamin Fodor – is a costumed vigilante who began patrolling the streets of Seattle just over a decade ago: stopping car thieves, preventing drunk drivers from entering their vehicles, breaking up fights. He gained notoriety as citizens compared stories of the masked man who emerged from the shadows to come to their rescue. Then the stories grew. At one point, it was said that Jones had foiled a terrorist plot. He has been shot at and stabbed in the pursuit of justice, and has inspired a wave of copycat superheroes in the process. He took up mixed martial arts and filmed himself buying ice-cream for children, but it all came screeching to a halt when Jones was arrested for allegedly trying to sell class A drugs to an undercover police officer in 2020. It is a story that’s fascinating and bewildering in equal measure. The Superhero Complex tells it perfectly, but this has nothing to do with its creator’s love of costumed crusaders. “I’ve been dreading having to say this in public”, says its creator David Weinberg over Zoom from his loft in Los Angeles. “But I’m not a comic book guy. Growing up I didn’t really care for the Marvel movies. I find them really boring. It’s like, ‘I know who’s gonna win this fight’. It all just feels very formulaic.” But, despite Weinberg’s ambivalence towards superheroes in general, even he could see that Jones’s story had the potential to be fascinating. “I got an email from (podcast producers) Novel,” he says. “They were like: ‘You wanna host this podcast about Phoenix Jones?’ And I was like, ‘Who’s Phoenix Jones?’ I never knew anything about him. I didn’t know anything about real-life superheroes and that excited me. I wanted to explore this world because it was new to me, and I didn’t have any preconceived ideas about it”. It is this distance between host and subject that makes The Superhero Complex so compelling. Weinberg notes that many of the people who have previously covered the Phoenix Jones beat have dressed up in costumes and fought crimes alongside him – “I think there’s something about certain journalists who are drawn to this, maybe,” he smiles, wryly – whereas there’s something of an uncertain tone about his particular investigation. If the first few episodes are any indication, at least, Weinberg and Jones spend much of their time at arm’s length, unsure of how much they can trust each another. Early on, for example, we hear Weinberg travel to Seattle to meet Jones, only for Jones to ghost him upon arrival. Weinberg talks to other Seattle superheroes, instead, who all voice their hatred for Jones. When they do eventually meet in person, Jones refuses to be interviewed until he’s paid. These encounters help build a picture of a man who is at best complicated and at worst outright horrible. “I had formed pretty strong opinions about him, and they weren’t good”, Weinberg recalls of the moments before their first meeting. “I was nervous about how I was going to confront him. He’s so charismatic that he won me over. I was like, ‘Oh, you’re right and everyone else is wrong.’ I made three trips up there. I would interview Phoenix, and come away being like, ‘Oh my God, this guy’s the real deal’. Then I would go do some reporting and talk to other people, and they would correct a lot of the things he said. Then I’d be like, ‘This guy’s a fucking liar.’” Jones isn’t as active as he was a few years ago. This is partly down to his arrest – it’s hard to see someone as an unassailable bastion of justice when they’re accused of trying to sell drugs to a police officer – but even before that, his reputation took a public knock. “There’s a moment in Phoenix’s career, a turning point, where he fights a guy in public”, Weinberg explains. “Phoenix claims this guy is harassing him, and he says ‘Fine, let’s just fight.’ Phoenix is a semi-professional MMA fighter, and this is just a drunk guy. Is this what superheroes do? Pick on people who are clearly not equipped to fight? When that video came out, a lot of people turned on Phoenix, saying ‘This is just a bully. This is the guy who’s going around beating up drunk people.’” Yet, Weinberg can’t quite bring himself to come down hard against real-life superheroes. This is because, unexpectedly for him, he found value in their services. Speaking of one superhero in particular, who devotes himself to performing qualified medical work to those in need, he says, “I have a lot of the same criticisms of the US justice system. There’s a housing crisis in the US. The amount of homeless people on the streets is vastly higher than it should be. So I identify with that desire to do something about it. I did not think about those aspects of it at all when I was doing research, that a lot of what they do is basic humanitarian stuff. Like I said, I’m not into superheroes, so I’m not going to put a costume on. But outside that, pretty much everything else they do is good work that needs to be done.” What he thinks of Jones, on the other hand, remains to be seen. As we speak, Weinberg is gearing up to write the final episode of the podcast, and he knows that he will be expected to give his definitive judgment on the man. “I still don’t know. When I’m with the guy, I believe him. Then when I talk to everyone else …” He pauses to sigh. “It’s been a really disorienting reporting experience.” Nor is he expecting a particularly welcome reaction from Jones, given that in his interviews with Weinberg, he was less than complimentary about previous journalists who had profiled him. In an upcoming episode, we hear him describe Jon Ronson as “hiding in a cab in a cardigan”. “He can attack me but he’s still the type of person where, if I was in Seattle, I would text him and be like, ‘Hey, do you want to get a cup of coffee?’”, says Weinberg. “He’s a super fun person to be around, but he has a knee-jerk reaction to being criticised”. Does that mean that he and Jones are still in touch? “He’s super flaky,” Weinberg shrugs. “So I’m in touch with him in the sense that I have sent him multiple texts and emails about factchecking, and he has not responded to any of that.” The superhero life must be busy, I say. “It’s so funny”, Weinberg grins. “The last time I texted him, I said, ‘I just need you to respond to these things that people said about you’. And he’s like, ‘Sorry, I’m in the middle of trying to get a visa to go and fight in Ukraine. That was the last I heard. That was the last text I had from him, which was more than a month ago.” That’s incredible, I say, my jaw now fully dropped. He’s a war hero now. “I’m pretty sure he can’t go to Ukraine”, Weinberg scoffs, good-naturedly. “He’s on felony probation.”",Arts/Television & radio,Who is that masked man?

4/12/2022,"Donald Trump is “very intent on bringing my brother down”, Joe Biden’s sister said. “The only race I wasn’t enthusiastic about Joe getting involved in was the 2020 presidency,” Valerie Biden Owens told CBS News. “Because I expected, and was not disappointed, that it would be ugly and mean, and it would be an attack on my brother, Joe, personally and professionally, because the former president is very intent on bringing my brother down.” A year-and-a-half into his presidency, Biden is battling crises at home including inflation and the coronavirus pandemic and abroad, over the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Trump dominates the Republican party, propagating the “big lie” about voter fraud in his defeat by Biden which fueled the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, continuing to attack Biden as incapable of the demands of office, flirting with a third White House run and dispensing endorsements to candidates in the midterm elections. On Sunday, the Republican House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, claimed Republicans would not swiftly impeach Biden “for political purposes”, should as expected the party take the House in November. Biden Owens helped raise her brother’s children after his first wife and daughter were killed in a car crash and has worked on all his campaigns. She has written a book called Growing Up Biden: A Memoir. “I assumed from the beginning that the former president and his entourage would attack my brother by going and attacking my family,” she said. Trump has focused on Hunter Biden, the president’s son who has written his own book about his struggle with addiction and whose business affairs are the subject of scrutiny. Hunter Biden was one subject of Trump’s attempt to withhold military aid from Ukraine in exchange for political dirt, an attempt which led to Trump’s first impeachment. To Republicans, Hunter Biden remains a tempting target. Federal investigators are known to be looking at his financial affairs. His aunt told CBS: “There hasn’t been a there, there since it was mentioned in 2019 or whenever it was.” She also said: “Hunter has written in exquisite detail about his struggle with addiction, his walk through hell, and I am so grateful he has been able to walk out of hell, but I don’t think there’s a family in this country who hasn’t tasted it.” Trump’s destructive power remains widely feared. Pundits and rivals are watching his endorsements closely, among them a choice to back Mehmet Oz, a TV doctor, for the Senate nomination in Pennsylvania, a pick many Republicans opposed. On Monday, a possible rival to Trump for the 2024 Republican nomination, Ron DeSantis, was offered a warning which might have sounded familiar to Valerie Biden Owens. Nikki Fried, a Democrat running to oppose DeSantis for governor in Florida, told Business Insider that if Trump runs again and gets back on Twitter – from which he has been banned since the Capitol attack – “I say one tweet created [DeSantis] and one tweet can destroy him”.",News/US news,"Trump ‘very intent on bringing my brother down’, Joe Biden’s sister says",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/12/trump-valerie-biden-owens-sister-book

Sweden’s complex libel laws meant that women were being charged with defamation after naming the men who had allegedly abused them. When the movement started in 2017, Helin had trusted in the Swedish system. Surely Sweden – a bulwark of liberal feminism, ranked fifth in the world by the World Economic Forum for gender equality – would deliver the justice women so desperately craved. Instead of demanding heads on a pike, Helin and her fellow organisers backed an open letter and campaign calling for reform, staging a public reading of anonymous testimonies from abused and harassed women. “In theory,” says Helin, “it’s very sympathetic not to mention people and bring them out, like we did in the middle ages, to hang them publicly and so on. It’s very modern and kind.” The few women who did name names paid a stiff price: to date, at least 12 women have been prosecuted for defamation related to #MeToo cases, among them actor Cissi Wallin, convicted in 2019 after naming a journalist she claimed had raped her. The man denies the allegation. “The rage hurt me so much,” says Helin. “I suffered for my rage.” Her anger was, in part, at her own naivety. “I realised the hope we had was not realistic,” she says, “and that people don’t give a shit about things, as long as they can make money from it. I also realised that I need to stop being surprised by the same shit.” Something else Helin has realised over the years, she says, “is how different Sweden is from other countries, and that also mirrors the way we arranged the #MeToo movement in Sweden. We believed that with trust and working together we’d be able to change something, but it didn’t work out as I hoped it would.” There were warning signs. In 2019, Helin met the actor Rosanna Arquette, who has been at the forefront of the US movement, at a dinner at the Stockholm film festival. “She couldn’t get her head around why we were doing this,” Helin laughs. “She was like, ‘and they go free? What’s your fucking plan?’” Now, Helin thinks Arquette may have been right. “When I look at it now,” Helin questions, “I wonder, did we try to approach a very dirty subject without touching the dirt?” For Helin, stepping into her own force means taking solace in her work. “The way to breathe through these years has been creating Lust,” she says. She is referring to her latest show, an HBO comedy about four middle-aged women and their sex lives, which she co-created. Today, as we speak on Zoom, Helin is wearing an oversized Lust-branded sweatshirt bearing the motto “Sex is the Highway to Health”, the name of the first episode. Helin stars as Anette, a researcher investigating a link between the sex lives and wellbeing of middle-aged women, while reluctantly confronting the reality of her own sexless marriage. “I’m a parent,” says Helin of her role, “I’ve been working hard, I have a long marriage behind me, I have several friends with the same experience. I think it’s a universal theme that happens to many people.” Lust is frequently hilarious and explicit. Between them, Anette and her best friends Nadia (Anja Lundqvist), Ellen (Julia Dufvenius) and Martina (Elin Klinga) have illicit relationships with fitness-bro personal trainers, go to couple’s therapy, and, in one particularly memorable scene, a character accidentally throws a vibrator at their toddler. “Lust came from a creative lust to work with some colleagues of mine,” says Helin. “We explored what subjects we want to dive into and realised that we can’t talk with each other about our sex lives, and that’s probably the same for people around the world.” Helin and her fellow co-creators Lundqvist, Dufvenius, Åsa Kalmér and the lone man Frans Milisic Wiklund sat on her living room floor, brainstorming. Around the same time, in July 2016, the Swedish ministry of health and social affairs announced that it would be carrying out a national survey on sexuality. It felt serendipitous, and Helin and her colleagues created the character of Anette in response. But there are serious themes beyond the shagging, which is unsurprising given that Dufvenius, Lundqvist and Helin were all involved in the Swedish #MeToo movement. Anette is sexually harassed at work, and discouraged from reporting it by her supervisor. Martina’s husband leaves her for a much younger woman, and she writes a feminist memoir in response. “I think you say it best in Britain,” Helin responds. “You have to laugh about things or you’ll jump off a bridge.” I’m interested to know how Helin reconciles her feminist views with the explosion of gory crime dramas featuring violence against women, prompted, in part, by the phenomenal success of shows such as The Bridge, in which she played the detective Saga Norén. “Violence against women is not something that is entertainment for me,” Helin says, “but I don’t just see it in crime dramas.” She points out that Scandi noir doesn’t have a monopoly on violence against women: “If you look at any Greek drama, they kill each other.” Training at the Calle Flygare theatre school in Stockholm in the 90s, Helin remembers actors rushing home to watch the British police procedural drama Prime Suspect, starring Helen Mirren. “I think crime for us in Sweden came from the UK,” she says. When The Bridge was screened in 2011, Helin’s performance was celebrated for bringing an autistic character to a wider audience. (The makers neither confirmed nor denied that Saga was autistic.) But recent years have seen able-bodied or neurotypical actors slammed for playing disabled or neurodivergent characters: in 2019, Bryan Cranston defended playing a wheelchair user in The Upside, while the musical movie Music, released in 2021 and starring neurotypical performer Maddie Ziegler as a teenager with autism, also received criticism from some within the autistic community. “My job is to be a chameleon,” says Helin of the debate. “That’s what I love about doing it. So, just as the world should be free, actors should be free to do whatever parts they want to do.” Helin is a charming, candid presence and so anxious for my opinion on Lust or #MeToo that at times our discussion feels less like an interview and more like a conversation between friends. She is unpretentious, despite the fact that she has achieved national treasure status in Sweden, thanks largely to the runaway success of The Bridge, as well as the Emmy-winning second world war series Atlantic Crossing, in which she starred and also executive produced. She only had to mention Lust to producer Sandra Harms at a party – “not really sober,” Helin laughs – for it to be made. Was she concerned that her involvement in #MeToo might bring her professional repercussions? “If someone wants to blacklist me, I don’t want to work with that person anyway,” Helin says. She wasn’t always so confident, but times of struggle have at least offered inspiration to draw upon, she says. “As an actor, that’s my bank: having failed and experienced terrible things – that’s where I get everything from. Also being a woman – for example, I’ve never visited Hollywood, I’ve never been to LA, because I realised that’s a place you can be torn to pieces as a woman. I also felt this very big pressure that if I would ever try to be in that arena, you have to be a perfect beauty. And before #MeToo, I would get the weirdest questions about my scar, and why I don’t get rid of it.” She is referring to her facial scar from a cycling accident when she was 24. On another occasion, a British journalist interviewing Helin asked why Saga wasn’t thinner. “I froze,” she says, “[mouth] wide open. I wasn’t prepared for that kind of question. Then I thought afterwards, ‘I should have answered: I didn’t know that Saga Norén was also anorexic.’ But I’m a normal woman, so it also felt like a vulnerable spot.” When she was 35, a director told her that she had to hurry up and get to Hollywood, because she only had five more years to go in her career. “So in that sense,” says Helin, now 49, “it’s such a relief to be on the other side.” She is planning a second series of Lust, as well as a project about “a woman of my age from the 12th century who was a revolutionary, a holy person, a total fuck up – she started her revolution when she was 55 years old.” Helin says it’s too early in this “gigantic project” to name the woman, but that she is drawn to projects and stories where there’s “an unanswered question”. For Atlantic Crossing, in which she played the real-life Crown Princess Martha of Norway as she navigated the personal and professional to build a diplomatic relationship with Franklin D Roosevelt during the second world war, this unanswered question was “how you lead your country and what are a leader’s responsibilities?” With Anette in Lust, Helin’s question is, why, when she is one of the most in-demand researchers in the country, she is unable to articulate her sexual desire to her husband, or impose house rules on her teenage daughter. Helin has seen many Anettes among the women around her. “[Their] biggest fear is to take up the space,” she says. “They already have the space, but they don’t own it, because they are so shaken by the [gender-defined] roles they are allowed to play as women.” Helin admits that she was once this woman, too. “I can recognise that a lot within myself,” she says. “It’s much easier to take a step back than to own the space.” Helin believes Swedish social norms compound this sense of disenfranchisement – such as the law of Jante, which is taught to every child in school, and upholds that nobody is better or more special than anyone else. “So for the ones who succeed in Sweden,” says Helin, “they should really keep their head down because that’s something to be a little bit ashamed of, taking so much space. It’s very typical Swedish.” After the overwhelming success of The Bridge, Helin struggled to cope with international fame, a punishing workload and raising two children. “I was pushed out of my orbit,” she says. She coped by withdrawing into herself, keeping her head down and getting on with things. Then the #MeToo movement happened and, for a while, Helin hoped the situation would improve for Swedish women and girls. She had her own story, although she has never spoken about it publicly. She wouldn’t rule it out, though. “Maybe,” she says. “If I have a reason.” After initial hope, Helin watched the movement evaporate, as woman after woman fell silent. Unlike in the UK, where truth is the ultimate defence against a libel suit, in Sweden, before defendants get a chance to prove that their statements are true, they must prove that it was in the public interest to publish them. “It’s very interesting,” says Helin drily, “with the system in Sweden, where you can be prosecuted for telling your truth, even if it is true, [and] even if you can prove it’s true.” The man who Wallin alleged raped her was not deemed a public enough figure to justify publishing the allegations so whether they were true or not was never considered by the court. That is not to say that Wallin would have otherwise won the case – after she reported the alleged incident to the police in 2011, they decided there wasn’t enough evidence to prosecute. An earlierblow to the movement took place in 2018, when Benny Fredriksson, formerly head of the Kulturhuset Stadsteatern (the Stockholm arts and culture centre), killed himself. He had been accused of sexual misconduct and pressuring a woman into an abortion, although investigators found no evidence to support these claims and the newspaper that published the initial allegations retracted some of its reporting. Fredriksson’s death hardened public opinion against #MeToo, and several high-profile figures, including the actor Noomi Rapace and the novelist Lotta Lundberg, subsequently distanced themselves from the movement. “That was super-scary for people,” says Helin. “Most people don’t want to hurt anyone like that.” Helin is at pains to emphasise that the movement wasn’t a total bust. “It also worked in many ways,” she says. “Many bosses here really try to make a change to keep their employees safe. The problem is that it’s a very slow way of changing things and businesses abroad don’t have a clue about the potentially dysfunctional people that we export from Sweden. It’s like sending out loose cannons to international productions.” For now, Helin has decided, “My best activism [is] just to keep working … that’s where I’m the best.” Last year was a turning point: the note on the wall, the decision to step into her power, after a lifetime of contorting herself into a more acceptable frame of being. “I can say and do whatever I want,” she says. “Whenever I want. So that’s a new kind of freedom for me. I’m not going to go into that scared state of mind.” It is a newfound devil-may-care attitude, and one that will reap dividends for audiences in Sweden and around the world. “The doors are so wide open to my ideas, to stories, to opportunities,” Helin says, with a glint in her eye. “I feel like my life has started in a new way. I’ve never been this confident or enthusiastic, or felt so free.” Sofia Helin is starring in Lust, available worldwide now on HBO Max",Arts/Television & radio,"‘I suffered for my rage’: Sofia Helin on Lust, The Bridge and the collapse of Sweden’s #MeToo movement",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/12/i-suffered-for-my-rage-sofia-helin-on-lust-the-bridge-and-the-collapse-of-swedens-metoo-movement
