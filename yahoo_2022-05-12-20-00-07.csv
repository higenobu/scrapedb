5/12/2022,"Casey White, the dangerous murder inmate who bolted from an Alabama prison with his jailer, has told detectives that the lovebirds spent most of their time on the run holed up in a cheap Indiana motel and plotting where to go next. Casey White, 38, and Lauderdale County assistant director of corrections Vicky White, 56, were captured on Monday night after a dramatic police chase in Evansville, Indiana, just a five-hour drive from the Florence prison they absconded from 11 days earlier. The pair initially drove 100 miles north through Tennessee where they dumped Vicky’s rust-colored Ford Edge and transferred into a black Ford pickup truck and headed farther north. The truck was spotted on May 3, four days after they escaped, abandoned at a car wash another 200 miles north in Evansville. Surveillance video from the car wash showed Casey White hopping into a grey Cadillac, which a sharp-eyed cop then spotted parked outside Evansville’s Motel 41 on Monday, police said. Cops lay in wait for the pair to leave the motel and when they eventually did on Monday afternoon, a chase began. Vicky White fatally shot herself as cops closed in but Casey White surrendered without incident when their Cadillac crashed, authorities said. While a coroner will have to confirm that she died by suicide, Vicky was found with a gun in her hand. She was also on the phone to 911 mid-chase, saying she had a gun to her head, Vanderburgh County Sheriff Dave Wedding told CNN. Wedding, whose county includes Evansville, seemed incredulous that the fugitives decided to camp out in the small city of 110,000 located along the Ohio River. “After six days [since the car wash sighting] it was just hard to believe that they were here. I wouldn’t think that somebody on the run would stay in a community like Evansville for six days,” he said at a Tuesday morning briefing. Runaway Guard Killed Herself as Cops Chased Her and Inmate He said detectives have since interviewed Casey White, who allegedly told them he planned to get into a shootout with law enforcement but was stymied when the Cadillac hit a grass ditch and was rammed by police. Wedding said White also explained what they had spent their time on the run doing, and what their plan was. “He said he was just trying to find a place to hide out and lay low and they thought they’d driven long enough that they wanted to stop for a while, get their bearings straight, and then figure out the next place to travel,” he said. Wedding said the pair had paid for a 14-day stay at the Motel 41, a $50-a-night joint with unflattering online reviews about bedbugs and moldy walls. “[He] said they were trying to contemplate where they could go and be discretely away from the public eye,” he added. Police display a photo of weapons found after the pair’s capture. Cops found multiple red and blonde wigs the pair used as disguises as well as a stash of guns and $29,000 in cash. They appear to have blown through money as Vicky White reportedly withdrew $90,000 in cash—the proceeds of selling her house—before they escaped. The pair legally purchased the Ford pickup truck but it’s unclear how they obtained the Cadillac, Wedding said. “Their plan was pretty faulty,” Wedding said. “They’re criminals, their plan was faulty and it failed, thank God.” Casey White will be extradited back to Alabama under heavy security at an undisclosed time on Tuesday. In his interview with detectives, he didn’t express any remorse or reveal why Vicky shot herself. While Vicky’s family initially told The Daily Beast that Casey must have “brainwashed” her, Wedding said there were no signs that she had been acting under duress. “He was not forcing her, it was a mutual relationship,” Wedding said.

5/12/2022,"The UK's Advertising Standards Authority has banned Adidas' sports bra ads featuring bare breasts. Some complainants told the ASA that the ads ""objectified women"" and reduced them to body parts. Adidas had released the ads to highlight the diversity of breasts and promote its sports bra range. The UK has banned a series of adverts for Adidas sports bras that featured bare breasts. In complaints to the UK's Advertising Standards Authority, some people said that the adverts objectified and sexualized women and were inappropriate for children. Adidas released the ad campaign in February, which included both social-media posts and posters featuring images of a variety of exposed breasts, in some cases with the nipples blurred out. The campaign was released to highlight the uniqueness and diversity of breasts and promote the 72 sizes included in Adidas' sports bra range, the company said. The posters were accompanied by text reading: ""The reasons we didn't make just one new sports bra."" Posts on Instagram and Twitter had longer captions with a similar sentiment. But the campaign sparked controversy online, with some social-media users describing the image as ""distasteful"" and ""explicit."" The ASA said it received 24 complaints about the campaign. Some said that the ads may have been ""harmful and offensive"" because they ""objectified women by sexualizing them and reducing them to body parts,"" per the ASA. Complainants also questioned whether the posters, which were displayed in public places, were appropriate for children. Some social-media users have lauded Adidas for the campaign, however, commenting on the Instagram post with heart and clapping emojis. ""Thank you for showing more brown breasts than the average health textbook!"" one comment reads. ""Although we did not consider that the way the women were portrayed was sexually explicit or objectified them, we considered that the depiction of naked breasts was likely to be seen as explicit nudity,"" the ASA said Wednesday. ""We noted the breasts were the main focus in the ads, and there was less emphasis on the bras themselves, which were only referred to in the accompanying text."" The ASA said that that because the posters contained explicit nudity and were displayed in places where they were likely to be seen by children, they were ""inappropriately targeted, and were likely to cause widespread offence."" The tweet featuring the image was ""not in keeping with their usual content"" and was therefore ""likely to cause widespread offence,"" the ASA said. ""The ads must not appear again in the forms complained of,"" the ASA said. ""We told Adidas UK Ltd to ensure their ads did not cause offence and were targeted responsibly."" Adidas told Insider: ""The gallery creative was designed to show just how diverse breasts are, featuring different shapes and sizes that highlight why tailored support is paramount."" ""It is important to note that the ASA ruling was related to this creative being used in an untargeted fashion rather than the creative itself and the message, which we stand proudly behind,"" the company added. The ASA said that Adidas UK had released the images to ""reflect and celebrate different shapes and sizes, illustrate diversity, and demonstrate why tailored support bras were important"" and hasn't considered the ads as sexual. Adidas told the ASA that it had submitted the ads to the Committees of Advertising Practice, who had said the images weren't sexual but that the use of nudity brought risk. As a result, Adidas didn't place the ads near schools or religious venues, it said.

5/12/2022,"Whether you’re the queen of England or a newborn baby, everyone pees. The average person flushes five to six times a day, but urine is not something most people typically keep a close eye on — unless they suddenly notice an unusual color in the toilet. Despite what you might have heard, clear urine is not the only hallmark of good health. A range of colors is acceptable. Urine is made up of excess water, electrolyte salts and other waste. The kidneys produce urine, which finds its way into the bladder and is later excreted. The bladder fills up, and eventually reaches a point when it can’t hold anymore, which causes the sensation that informs you that you must make a visit to the bathroom. This process is necessary because it’s harmful to have too much water in your system. Dr. Mark Ellerkmann, director of the Center for Urogynecology at Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore, tells Yahoo Life that toxins in the body and bloodstream need to be eliminated. As the kidneys filter the blood, they remove toxins and extra water to make urine. Of course, if your pee is coming out a blood orange color, it’s normal to be concerned. Some health conditions can change the color of urine. Fortunately, experts say, there are also many nonmedical reasons for such changes. Ellerkmann says that the shade can depend on urine concentration, which influences a natural pigment called urochrome. When the urine is more concentrated (with less water and more waste product), it’s darker. When you’re hydrated, the urine is less concentrated and you have a clear or light color. Other things, for example, your medication, your diet and any infections you may experience, can cause the urine to change color. “Your color can vary depending on your hydration status. Any transient changes in urine color should not alarm you,” Ellerkmann says. The color of your urine can serve as a window to your health. If your urine is yellow… If you’re well-hydrated, your urine will probably be a clear or light yellow. Ellerkmann explains that this has to do with maintaining a balance of fluids as the kidneys eliminate excess fluid in the body. “We don’t want to become dehydrated, but we also don’t want to become over-hydrated,” he says. “This whole concept of homeostasis and fluid management is something the kidneys handle.” When a person is getting enough water, the kidney flushes out the excess, leaving a clear, lighter color. With dehydration, the kidney holds on to the fluids, and the urine is darker. “Generally, I tell patients to drink enough water to keep their urine light yellow, but that amount can be different for everybody,” Dr. Jason Kim, associate professor of urology at the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University and director of the Women's Pelvic Health and Continence Center at Stony Brook Medicine, tells Yahoo Life. If your urine is orange… One of the most common explanations for orange urine is medication. Kim explains that pyridium is frequently prescribed for urinary tract infections (UTIs), and that one of its side effects is that it turns urine a reddish-orange. This is a sign that the medicine is doing its job, and the color will go away once you stop taking the medication. Some laxatives and certain chemotherapy drugs have the same effect. Kim says taking high amounts of vitamin also produce a bright yellow or orange urine. These vitamins, such as riboflavin, are water-soluble and not completely absorbed by the body. When there is too much vitamin B, the kidneys filter and remove the excess, resulting in a lot of bright yellow to orange urine. Another nutrient responsible for orange urine is beta carotene, the pigment that gives carrots its orange color. If your urine has a blue or green tint… Kim says medications including some anesthetics, such as propofol, have occasionally turned urine blue. For those undergoing a procedure or medical intervention, doctors can sometimes use certain dyes that can make the urine look blue. Eating foods with strong food coloring dyes can also cause urine to turn a shade of blue or green. If your urine is brown… If you're dehydrated, your urine may have a brown hue to it. Kim says dark brown urine indicates you're not drinking enough fluids, because your urine is too concentrated. But if you’re chugging water regularly, Ellerkmann says one reason for brown urine is that you’ve recently eaten some blackberries. If that’s the case, he says the urine color change is harmless and probably means you have just eaten a lot of the fruit in a short time. However, according to the Mayo Clinic, some liver and kidney disorders, as well as some urinary tract infections, can turn urine dark brown and warrant a doctor’s visit. If your urine is cloudy… Cloudy urine and a burning sensation or difficulty urinating can be a sign of a urinary tract infection. Kim says it’s important to see your doctor for a workup and get the right antibiotics for quick relief. If your urine is dark or red… While reddish pee can be due to eating certain types of produce — “some vegetables with vitamin B, rhubarb or beets can cause red urine,” notes Kim — a dark hue may represent blood in the urine, also called hematuria. Ellerkmann says this can be caused by several conditions involving the bladder and kidneys. “If it has more of a coffee grounds appearance, that would be very concerning,” he says. It can be a sign of blood in the urine from kidney stones, kidney cancer or bladder cancer. One indicator that dark urine is from blood, says Ellerkmann, is if it continues to show up for several days. “Persistent bright-red blood, bloody urine or very dark-colored urine should be evaluated,” he says. Blood in the urine is never normal and can signal a serious medical condition that should alert you to see your health care provider or a urologist immediately. A range of health problems involves blood in the urine, including: Kidney stones Cancer Urinary tract infection Kidney disease Bladder disease “The American Medical Association recommends a workup if there's blood in the urine, and this would include specialized urine tests, along with some sort of imaging tests such as a CAT [computerized tomography] scan and a cystoscopy,” Kim explains.

5/12/2022,"Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) poked a sore spot of Donald Trump’s on Wednesday after the former president attacked him and two sitting GOP governors as “RINOs” for supporting Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R). “Insightful commentary about three Republican Governors who were overwhelmingly re-elected by their people from a former president who lost to Joe Biden,” Christie tweeted. “Maybe the “R” in RINO really stands for re-elected.” Insightful commentary about three Republican Governors who were overwhelmingly re-elected by their people from a former President who lost to Joe Biden. Maybe the “R” in RINO really stands for re-elected. Proud to stand with @DougDucey@GovRicketts supporting @BrianKempGA — Governor Christie (@GovChristie) May 11, 2022 RINO, one of Trump’s favorite insults for conservatives who don’t support him, stands for “Republican in name only.” Trump used the term in a statement Wednesday attacking Christie as well as Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey and Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts for their allegiance to Kemp in his reelection campaign. Trump has had a vendetta against Kemp since the governor’s decision to certify Georgia’s 2020 election results, hindering Trump’s relentless efforts to flip the presidential vote count to his favor under false pretenses of fraud at the polls. Trump’s latest statement accused Kemp of being the “worst election integrity governor in the country.” Christie, Ducey and Ricketts are campaigning for Kemp in his primary challenge against former Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), whom Trump has endorsed. Perdue has peddled Trump’s lies that the election he lost to Biden was “rigged and stolen.” Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 and appears likely to do so again in 2024, was a longtime ally of Trump’s. He has been deeply critical of the former president over his role in inciting the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters.

Doctor Strange actress Zara Phythian and her husband, Victor Marke, have been convicted of multiple charges of child sex abuse in a British court. According to a document provided to EW by the Nottingham Crown Court clerk, 37-year-old Phythian — who was tried under the name Zara Marke — was convicted of 14 counts, with her 59-year-old husband convicted of 18. The counts for Phythian all relate to sexual activity with a child that occurred between December 2005 and December 2008. She is named alongside Marke in all of her charges, though he is individually included on four additional indecent assault charges (for actions dating back to September 2002) as an individual. Marke's offenses include indecent assault of a 15-year-old victim, while both were convicted of multiple counts of sexual activity with another underage victim beginning when she was 13. Their actions span multiple years and repeated occasions involving the same victim. Some abuse survivors believe the safety measures mandated by the settlement don't go far enough Phythian has two dozen credits listed on IMDb, the most notable being a small role in the 2016 Doctor Strange blockbuster opposite Benedict Cumberbatch as a ""Brunette Zealot."" She does not appear in the sequel, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. Per BBC reporting, Marke claimed that the sexual activity occurred on only one occasion, and that Phythian was not involved alongside him. Phythian reportedly denied any sexual activity with one of the victims. Judge Mark Watson remanded the couple into custody following the trial, ahead of their May 16 sentencing. ""Both of you know the sentence I pass on 16 May is likely to be measured by a considerable period of custody,"" he said at the trial. Nicole Hepburn from the Crown Prosecution Service said that Phythian and Marke were ""exposed as the true liars"" in the case, after the victims initially reported the pair years after the abuse began. ""This abuse may have occurred some years ago, but that makes it no less serious and nor is it a barrier to justice,"" Hepburn continued, according to the BBC.

5/12/2022,"WILSONS, Va. (AP) — Soon after Jim Medeiros bought his 143-acre (58-hectare) cattle and poultry farm in rural Virginia a decade ago, he and his wife were startled by the sounds of 20 hunting dogs barking and howling as they circled their house and chased their chickens. When Medeiros confronted a hunter nearby, the man told him he had permission to hunt on Medeiros’ property. In disbelief, Medeiros called the agency that enforces a state law allowing hunters to retrieve their hunting dogs from private property, even when the property owners object. “He told me, you can't prohibit people from coming onto your land,” recalled Medeiros. He then pointed out that his land was posted with no trespassing signs. “I said, 'You don't understand. My land is posted,'"" Medeiros said. “You don't understand,"" the official responded. “You can't stop them.” After years of putting up with baying dogs and dead chickens, Medeiros and several other property owners are suing the state over its “right to retrieve” law, arguing that allowing hunters to go on their property without permission amounts to an uncompensated taking of their land and violates the state and federal constitutions. Demonstrators gathered outside power plants in Grant Town, West Virginia, on Saturday, April 9, for a two-day protest against Sen Joe Manchin’s coal investments.The protest, dubbed the ‘Coal Baron Blockade’, was organized by West Virginia Rising, a coalition of activists, to “help elevate climate change to the center of the domestic agenda,” according to their website.Local sheriff arrested 16 protesters for trespassing on private property on Sunday.Footage filmed by Brendan Gutenschwager on Saturday shows protesters chanting “Machin, he sold us out” and holding a banner reading “Manchin: stop burning WV’s future for profit” outside the Grant Town Power Plant. Police are later seen making arrests.Video filmed by Gutenschwager on Sunday shows Rev William J Barber II leading a Palm Sunday service outside the American Bituminous Power Plant before it concluded near the Grant Town Power Plant, Gutenschwager wrote. Credit: Brendan Gutenschwager via Storyful A number of states allow hunters to retrieve their dogs without permission from property owners under certain circumstances, such as properties that do not have “no trespassing” signs. But Virginia's law says hunters are allowed to retrieve dogs even when the property owner has specifically denied access. A 2016 report prepared by the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, (now the Department of Wildlife Resources), said only one other state, Minnesota, had a similar law. Minnesota's law says a person can enter private land to retrieve a hunting dog without permission of the owner, but cannot have a firearm when doing so and must immediately leave after recovering the dog. Virginia's law prohibits hunters from carrying guns or bows and arrows while retrieving their dogs from private property. It also says hunters must identify themselves when asked by the landowner. If they refuse, they can be charged with a misdemeanor. The Virginia property owners are suing the Department of Wildlife Resources, which enforces the law. They are represented by the Pacific Legal Foundation, a conservative legal organization that won a major property rights case at the U.S. Supreme Court last year. The high court found that a California regulation requiring agricultural businesses to allow union organizers onto their property for up to three hours a day, 120 days per year, amounts to the government appropriating “a right of access to private property” and “constitutes a per se physical taking” under the court's precedents. Daniel Woislaw, a lawyer with the Pacific Legal Foundation, said he believes Virginia's “right to retrieve” law amounts to a similar physical taking of private property. “When Jim has to let deer dogs and deer dog hunters enter his property, and he's not allowed to tell them to stay away, and when they're killing his livestock and disrupting his operations, that's a taking of a valuable property interest,"" Woislaw said. The law itself was first put on the books in 1938, but the tradition of hunting with dogs dates back 400 years to colonial times, said Kirby Burch, a bear hunter who owns eight hunting dogs and is the chief executive officer of the Virginia Hunting Dog Alliance, a political action committee that represents about 90,000 hunters in the state. Burch said most hunters try to be considerate of land owners and quickly retrieve their dogs when they cross onto private property. “A lot a people who move here from other states are offended by the notion of hunting with dogs so when a dog runs across their property, they're offended, and I understand that, but I think the vast majority of hunters with dogs try in every way possible to avoid irritating their neighbors,"" said Burch, 75, who has been hunting with dogs since he was 5. Burch's group estimates that more than half of the 254,000 licensed hunters in Virginia hunt with dogs. The lawsuit asks the court for a judgment declaring that the law takes the plaintiffs' private property without compensation for public use, a violation of the state constitution and the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Multiple attempts have been made in the legislature to overturn the law, but none have succeeded. Ryan Brown, executive director of the Department of Wildlife Resources, declined to comment on the lawsuit. Brown said hunters and private landowners have been able to peacefully co-exist for the most part, but as more rural land has been developed and Virginia has become more suburbanized, the  two groups have been at loggerheads over the hunting dog issue. “Both sides of the debate have vested interests, with the hunters being very interested in the protection of their hunting dogs and real property owners being interested in protection of their rights as land owners,” Brown said. “Both sides have been very passionate about their views.”",U.S./Associated Press,Private property owners sue over Virginia's hunting dog law,https://news.yahoo.com/private-property-owners-sue-over-141505922.html

Dingzhen was hired as an ambassador for his hometown in Litang of Sichuan Province in southwestern China – known as one of the most poverty-stricken counties in the country – and turned it into a popular tourist destination. He was invited to several events including the United Nations Development Programme’s World Earth Day last year.

 

Many people online, however, began ridiculing the 21-year-old as being talentless. They also criticized Dingzhen’s fans for purportedly placing a higher value on appearances than achievements. The online attacks escalated after a video of Dingzhen vaping was posted to social media in January 2021.

“10 years of hard academic study is not a quarter as good as Dingzhen’s smile,” one user sarcastically wrote.

A survey conducted by leading sports forum Hupu in December 2020 showed that 63% of the respondents believed they were more attractive than Dingzhen.

Dingzhen has already begun to pursue legal action against those who have posted defamatory comments and threatened to sue any others who suggest that he is nothing more than “a handsome face.”

“Never dare do anything evil no matter how trivial you think it is,” Dingzhen is quoted as saying in the lawyer's letter.

5/12/2022,"NEUILLY-SUR-SEINE, France (Reuters) -The Russian military's failure to seize the Ukrainian capital was inevitable because in the preceding years they had never directly faced a powerful enemy, according to a former mercenary with the Kremlin-linked Wagner Group who fought alongside the Russian army. Marat Gabidullin took part in Wagner Group missions on the Kremlin's behalf in Syria and in a previous conflict in Ukraine, before deciding to go public about his experience inside the secretive private military company. He quit the Wagner group in 2019, but several months before Russia launched the invasion on Feb. 24 Gabidullin, 55, said he received a call from a recruiter who invited him to go back to fighting as a mercenary in Ukraine. He rejected the offer, because, he said, he did not agree on principle with the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. He also said Russian forces were not up to the job, even though they trumpeted their arsenal of new weapons and their successes in Syria where they helped President Bashar al-Assad defeat an armed rebellion. ""They were caught completely by surprise that the Ukrainian army resisted so fiercely and that they faced an actual army,"" Gabidullin said about Russia's setbacks in Ukraine. He said people on the Russian side expected to face rag-tag militias when they invaded Ukraine, not well-drilled regular troops. ""I told them: 'Guys, that's a mistake',"" said Gabidullin, who is now in France where he is publishing a book about his experiences fighting with the Wagner Group. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he did not know who Gabidullin was and whether he has ever been a member of private military companies. ""We, the state, the government, the Kremlin can not have anything to do with it,"" he said. The Russian defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation” that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. Gabidullin is part of a small but growing cohort of people in Russia with security backgrounds who have supported President Vladimir Putin's foreign incursions but now say the way the war is being conducted is incompetent. Igor Girkin, who helped lead a pro-Kremlin armed revolt in eastern Ukraine in 2014, has been critical of the way this campaign is being conducted. Alexei Alexandrov, an architect of the 2014 rebellion, told Reuters in March the invasion was a mistake. Gabidullin took part in some of the bloodiest Syrian clashes in Deir al-Zor province, in Ghouta and near the ancient city of Palmyra. He was seriously injured in 2016 when a grenade exploded behind his back during a battle in the mountains near Latakia. Gabidullin spent a week in a coma and three months in a hospital where he had surgeries to remove one of his kidneys and some intestines. Reuters has independently verified he was in the Wagner Group and was in combat in Syria. Wagner Group fighters have been accused by rights groups and the Ukrainian government of committing war crimes in Syria and eastern Ukraine from 2014 onwards. Gabidullin said he had never been involved in such abuses. DIFFERENT PROPOSITION Moscow's involvement helped turn the tide of the Syrian war in favour of Assad, but Gabidullin said Russia's military restricted itself mainly to attacks from the air, while relying on Wagner mercenaries and other proxies to do the lion's share of the fighting on the ground. The Russian military's task was easier too. Its opponents -- Islamic State and other militias -- had no anti-aircraft systems or artillery. Fighting Ukraine, he said, was a different proposition. ""I've seen enough of them in Syria... (The Russian military) didn't take part in combat directly,"" he said in an interview in Paris to promote his book, which will be published by French publishing house Michel Lafon this month. ""The military forces .... when it was needed to learn how to fight, did not learn how to fight for real,"" he said. Wagner Group is an informal entity, with -- on paper at least -- no offices or staff. The U.S. Treasury Department and the European Union have said the Wagner Group is linked to Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin. Prigozhin has denied any such links. Concord Management and Consulting, Prigozhin’s main business, did not respond to a request for comment. President Vladimir Putin has said private military contractors have the right to work and pursue their interests anywhere in the world as long as they do not break Russian law. Putin has said the Wagner Group neither represented the Russian state nor was paid by it. Gabidullin said although he had known the Russian invasion of Ukraine was coming, he did not expect it to be on such a scale. ""I could not even think that Russia will wage a war on Ukraine. How could that be? It's impossible,"" he said. He said he also did not believe attacking Ukraine, a sovereign state, was justified. ""Its right to be independent has to be respected. I don’t see in the actions of this state any aggression towards Russia."" ""I said: no guys, that’s without me please, you go yourselves. Ukraine for me is a part of the country where I was born and grew up, they are my compatriots,"" he said.

5/12/2022,"An annual event at Lake George in Florida lived up to its name – ""Mayhem at Lake George"" – after videos circulated online of brawls breaking out on the water. Last weekend at the lake 40 miles west of Daytona, hundreds gathered – many of them on boats – to enjoy music and libations. “People are just out there to have a good time, but like anything else, when you have a huge concentration of people like this and you have alcohol involved, you do have some incidents,” Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood told WESH 2, an Orlando-Daytona NBC TV station. A video posted to the sheriff's office Facebook page show men punching one another in the face and tackling one another into the water near the DJ deck. One man was seriously injured, the Volusia County Sheriff's Office told USA TODAY via email. That man was taken by boat to land then flown to a hospital.

5/12/2022,"Law enforcement officers in Indiana warned each other about the gun Vicky White had in her hand as they discussed how to retrieve her from her flipped vehicle, according to footage of the incident released by the Evansville Police Department on Tuesday. In one video, officers on the scene crouch in the grassy ditch by the overturned Cadillac, minutes after a U.S. Marshal rammed it, ending both a short police chase and White’s 11-day stint on the run with a murder suspect. The 56-year-old assistant director of corrections shot herself “almost instantaneously” before deputies could reach her, Vanderburgh County Sheriff Dave Wedding said at a Tuesday press conference. Vicky is unresponsive but “still breathing” in the footage, according to one officer discussing how to get her out. A suggestion to pop the front windshield off is quickly disregarded. “Anybody got a Hooligan?” someone asks, referencing a Halligan bar, a tool with a pick-end used by officers to force entry. https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2497518180379075 Eventually, the officer is handed the tool. He lowers himself onto his stomach. “I’m gonna go for the gun,” he says, retrieving the gun from White. In the partially censored footage, he then pulls the guard out of the sunroof by her wrists, with other officers helping to drag her onto grass and gravel. First responders then close in to administer first aid. In another video released by Indiana authorities, escaped inmate Casey White, no relation to Vicky, is seen being taken into custody after the chase. Authorities said that Casey had wanted to end his time on the lam with a police shootout, but a U.S. Marshal ramming the couple’s car during the chase swiftly put an end to that plan. After he emerged from the Cadillac uninjured, more than half a dozen officers crowded the 6-foot-9-inch-tall man, handcuffing him on the ground. Casey is marched away as officers continue to swarm the flipped car and surrounding area. The pair originally vanished from their Lauderdale County, Alabama, jail on April 29. On Tuesday, Sheriff Wedding told reporters that the lovebirds had driven to a cheap Indiana motel and holed up, trying to figure out where to go next. Casey, 38, was extradited back to Lauderdale County on Monday. A day later, a judge set a June trial date for his original murder charge—the “brutal” 2015 stabbing of a 58-year-old woman. Vicky was transported to a hospital, where she was declared dead on Monday night, according to police. Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton said Tuesday that $29,000 had been found in the Whites’ car, along with several wigs and a cache of weapons, including an AR-15 rifle and 9mm handguns. Casey had so far shown “no remorse” over his prison guard lover’s death, Singleton added. Read more at The Daily Beast.

How to decide what to do with a plummeting stock TikTok user Jess (@genericjess420) said that she always thought work was from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and was shocked to find out that a lot of jobs actually last from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and are broken up by an unpaid lunch hour. See this Manhattan apartment get an unbelievable maximalist makeover with just $1,000: “When did everyone collectively decide to sneak another hour in the workday for lunch that they won’t pay us for,” Jess wrote in the text overlay on her video. Unpaid meal breaks vary from state to state. In California, employees must receive a 30-minute meal break for every five hours they work, while in New York, it’s a break for every six hours. And in New York, employees also aren’t allowed to opt out of their lunch breaks and should not do any work during that meal period. The Fair Labor Standards Act, which is the federal wage law, does not require employers to provide meal breaks. Commenters agreed with Jess’s frustration over the situation. “IT’S A SCAM, people. Scam,” one person wrote. “Literally been lied to my whole life,” another agreed. “The unpaid lunch hour is a scam and such a strain on workers,” a commenter said.

5/12/2022,"British personality Oli London has continued to defend transracialism in a documentary series called “Would You Rather?”

London, 31, who underwent multiple surgeries to look like BTS member Jimin, most recently identified as a Korean woman using “they/them” pronouns.

 

In the May 2 episode of the Channel 4 series, London sat down with a Black woman, who was not named in the video, to discuss whether someone can identify as “transracial.”

“I identify as Korean,” London said. “I used to live in Korea. I was living there for one year. I love the culture, the history, the people. I put myself through a lot of pain, a lot of surgical procedures to have more of a Korean aesthetic. I spent a lot of time learning the language, learning how to cook Korean food.”

London said “people didn’t really get it” when they came out, but they hope to be more accepted over time.

On the other side of the table, the woman opened her response by immediately rejecting the idea of transracialism.



“Transracial does not exist, and I think it’s very, very harmful to push the narrative that it is possible to switch races,” she said.

“I can’t sit up here and suddenly say ‘Oh, I’m a white woman. And if you as a white person says, ‘Oh, I can be Black or I can be Korean,’ and I can’t swap or benefit from the privilege that you benefit from, then it’s clearly not an equal exchange. Because whiteness in this country has been set up in a way. How I interact with the police, how I interact with the medical system can result in me dying.”

The woman also discussed cultural appropriation, which she described as devaluing what ethnic minorities do.

“You are not a Korean man. No matter how much surgery you do, no matter how much of the aesthetic you adopt,” she told London.



In their defense, London reiterated their Korean experience and asserted that “no one can take that happiness away from me.”

While acknowledging that “no one can take away what a minority group has been through,” London claimed that “millions and millions” of people are already “combining cultures” by incorporating Korean elements from K-pop or K-dramas into their lifestyle.

“I’m Korean, people need to accept that,” they said.

The episode concluded with both parties standing their ground.

In a more recent interview with the Daily Mail, London identified themself as a gender-fluid Korean woman.

“While people know I recently had surgeries to transform my face, what I haven't shared with people yet is the recent surgeries I had are to help me to become a Korean woman.

“Over the last eight years I have struggled with identity issues and always been confused about who I am. So last year I came out as transracial Korean and that was an important step in my transition process.

“Now however, with my most recent surgeries I have been experimenting and exploring being a Korean woman and now feel ready to share with the world that I am gender fluid and now living as a Korean woman.”

As of June 2021, London was reported to have undergone 18 surgical procedures to look like Jimin. These include a facelift, temple lift and dental work that gave him “incredible custom-made new teeth” that were “based on Jimin’s smile,” among others.

5/12/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) - One of President Vladimir Putin's closest allies warned the West on Thursday that the increasing military support given to Ukraine by the United States and its allies risked triggering a conflict between Russia and the NATO military alliance. Former president Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy chairman of Russia’s security council, said such a conflict with NATO always carried the risk of turning into a full blown nuclear war. Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands of people, laid waste to swathes of its former Soviet neighbour and raised fears of the gravest confrontation between Russia and the United States since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. ""NATO countries pumping weapons into Ukraine, training troops to use Western equipment, sending in mercenaries and the exercises of Alliance countries near our borders increase the likelihood of a direct and open conflict between NATO and Russia,"" Medvedev said in a Telegram post. ""Such a conflict always has the risk of turning into a full-fledged nuclear war,"" Medvedev said. ""This will be a disastrous scenario for everyone."" Russia and the United States are by far the world's biggest nuclear powers: Russia has some 6,257 nuclear warheads while NATO's three nuclear powers - the United States, United Kingdom and France - have about 6,065 warheads combined, according to the Washington-based Arms Control Association. Putin says the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia and Moscow had to defend against the persecution of Russian-speaking people. Putin, who says Ukraine and Russia are essentially one people, casts the war as an inevitable confrontation with the United States, which he accuses of threatening Russia by meddling in its backyard through NATO eastward enlargement. Ukraine says it is fighting an imperial-style land grab and that Putin's claims of genocide are nonsense. Kyiv says Putin's invasion has only strengthened the Ukrainian people's wish to turn westwards out of Russia's orbit.

5/12/2022,"New audio has leaked of Sen. Lindsey Graham revealing his feelings about Biden and Trump. Graham is heard saying he thinks Biden is the ""best person"" to have after the Capitol riot. Graham also criticizes Trump in another tape, saying he ""plays the TV game"" and ""went too far."" New audiotapes have surfaced of Sen. Lindsey Graham, a known Trump ally, criticizing Trump and praising Biden after the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. The tapes were played on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" during an interview segment with New York Times reporters Alex Burns and Jonathan Martin. Martin interviewed Graham on January 6 directly after the riot, and the senator spoke candidly about then-President-elect Joe Biden and the former president, Trump. In the first audio clip, Graham said he thought everyone would ""come out of this stronger."" ""Moments like this reset. People will calm down. People will say, 'I don't want to be associated with that,'"" Graham said. ""This is a group within a group. What this does, there will be a rallying effect for a while, (then) the country says, 'We're better than this.'"" He was then asked if Biden would help make that happen, to which Graham said: ""Totally."" ""He'll maybe be the best person to have,"" Graham is heard saying. ""I mean, how mad can you get at Joe Biden?"" In a second audiotape played on CNN, Graham is heard saying in an interview after the riot that he thought Trump ""misjudged the passion,"" criticizing the former president's actions. ""He plays the TV game and he went too far here,"" Graham said. ""That rally didn't help, talking about primarying Liz (Cheney.) He created a sense of revenge."" Graham was likely referring to a part of Trump's speech at the Ellipse on January 6, 2021, when Trump suggested that his supporters ""primary the hell"" out of those who do not fight to overturn the election. Graham is known to be a staunch ally of the former president. However, Graham may have had a more complicated view of Trump. In Burns and Martin's new book, ""This Will Not Pass,"" they claim that Graham threatened to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office during the Capitol riot. Trump later mocked Graham, calling him a ""progressive senator from South Carolina"" during a March fundraising dinner at Mar-a-Lago. Graham has also publicly criticized Trump for floating the possibility of pardons for Capitol rioters, calling Trump's idea ""inappropriate."" This then prompted Trump to call Graham a RINO, a GOP insult meaning ""Republican in name only."" The term has been used often against Trump critics like GOP Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger.

5/12/2022,"Texas’ murky waterways hide massive beasts, but it takes a rod, fish heads, and a lot of fight to reveal them, video taken by a Houston-area angler shows. Payton Moore, a fisherman and YouTuber, could hardly see through the waves and wake when the alligator gar took his bait. At first he thinks he snagged a sunken tree, he says in a video recently posted on his YouTube channel, WILD LIFE. But then the thing on the hooks starts to wrestle with him. “We are on something enormous,” he says. The muddy river is somewhere “in the greater Houston area,” Moore told McClatchy News, but in the interest of protecting the fish, he declined to reveal anything more about his gar fishing spot. The strength pulling away from Moore hints at what creature he has on the hook. “It’s like walking a T-Rex,” he says. “Every time I think I’m going to muscle him up, he muscles me back down,” Moore says in the video. A rod won’t be enough, he decides. Moore readies a rope lasso as he pulls the gar closer to shore. The fight goes on and the beast breaches the surface. An “absolute dinosaur,” the angler says. While alligator gar might not be literal dinosaurs, they are an extremely old species that existed at the same time as dinosaurs, according to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. When the moment comes, Moore moves in close, loops the rope around the gar and pulls it in. On shore, he measures the fish at 8 feet, 2 inches long — 3 inches shy of the world record for length. Moore didn’t get the chance to weigh the fish before releasing it back into the river — so there’s no way to know how heavy it was for certain — but he estimates it was about 300 pounds. “This is by far the most amazing catch of my entire life and it’s not even close,” Moore says. “I could fish for the rest of my life and never see one like that again.” With measurements done, Moore carries the gar into the water and back to freedom, video shows. It thrashes out of his hands, easily knocking him over in the process. Catching and releasing is important, Moore wrote on his YouTube page, asking others to do the same, especially for gar. Despite their intimidating name and impressive set of teeth, alligator gar pose no danger to people, according to Texas wildlife experts, and there is no confirmed instance of a gar attacking a person. Their size and appearance make them a prized game fish, TPWD says. But the species has been declining and has even vanished from certain parts of the southern U.S., and overfishing is considered a large contributor. Fortunately however, “Texas populations are still strong,” experts say. With fossil records dating as far back as 215 million years, gar are “truly native Texans,” TPWD said. ‘Diet Coke was spewing everywhere’: Alligator crashes a pre-birthday party in Florida Angler reels in bass with parasitic surprise, Missouri photos show. ‘Lord have mercy’ ‘What the heck is this?’ Ice fisherman reels in rare ‘golden’ fish at Minnesota lake ‘Blue dragons’ appearing on Texas beaches don’t breathe fire, but be careful near them",U.S./Fort Worth Star-Telegram,"‘Like walking a T-Rex.’ Angler uses rod, lasso to reel in huge alligator gar in Texas",https://news.yahoo.com/walking-t-rex-angler-uses-213752282.html
5/12/2022,"By Karen Lema and Neil Jerome Morales MANILA (Reuters) - A quiet retirement for Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte is unlikely when he makes way for successor Ferdinand Marcos Jr., but efforts to put him on trial for thousands of killings in his ""war on drugs"" appear unlikely to prosper. Duterte's daughter, Sara Duterte-Carpio, helped get Marcos elected by agreeing to be his vice presidential running mate, allowing the son of the late dictator to tap her father's huge support to seal a comeback for the disgraced Marcos dynasty. Though there has been no formal quid-pro-quo, political experts say it is unlikely Marcos would risk burning crucial bridges by allowing the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate Duterte over the alleged execution-style killings in his war on drugs. Duterte, 77, will be stripped of the legal armour shielding him from legal action once he becomes a private citizen next month, making him an open target. Unbowed, he has said he will search for drug peddlers after he retires and ""shoot them and kill them"". At least 6,200 people have been killed in the war on drugs during Duterte's six-year rule. Rights groups and critics say law enforcers summarily executed drug suspects, but police say those killed were armed and had violently resisted arrest. The ICC in September approved an investigation into the killings, but temporarily suspended it in November at Manila's request. The ICC did not immediately respond when asked for an update on the probe's status. ""He will be safe, untouchable. Worse, even as ex-president, he could still weigh in on policy,"" said Carlos Conde, senior Philippines Researcher at Human Rights Watch. Marcos, during the campaign, has already intimated what he might do with the ICC investigators. ""I will let them into the country, but only as tourists,"" he said in January. ""We have a functioning judiciary that is why I do not see the need for a foreigner to come and do the job for us,"" Marcos said, mirroring the position of Duterte, who has repeatedly said he will not cooperate with the ICC. POLITICS IN HIS DNA However, it is not only the ICC that Duterte would have to contend with but also families of victims and human rights groups demanding accountability for the killings and other violations in the past six years. Randy delos Santos, an uncle of high-school student Kian delos Santos, whose death in 2017 led to rare convictions of police officers in the drug war, hoped the ICC would resume its probe. ""There are so many families of drug war victims, not just me,"" said Delos Santos, who cited many other cases belying government claims the victims had fought back. Cristina Palabay of human rights group Karapatan said: ""We are also preparing cases to file against Duterte after he steps down from office."" Spokespersons for Rodrigo Duterte and Marcos did not immediately respond to requests for comments. Duterte has only given hints on his future plans. He said this week he will return to his hometown of Davao city, where he served as mayor for more than two decades before becoming president in 2016. ""I will stay here in Davao. Even as a civilian, I will still help you. Just like what I promised when I first became mayor,"" Duterte said after casting his vote on Monday. Earl Parreno, author of a biography of Duterte entitled ""Beyond Will & Power"", said he finds it difficult to imagine the president totally dropping out of politics. ""Will he really retire quietly?"" he said. Duterte may decide to run for local office in the mid-term polls in 2025, Parreno said. It is not uncommon for former presidents in the Philippines to seek lower posts in office. ""If you have politics in your DNA, it would be difficult to stay away from it,"" he said. True to form, Duterte did not mince words when telling supporters of his plans after the presidency. ""I will go riding on a motorcycle and roam around...and I'll search for drug peddlers, shoot them and kill them,"" he said.
