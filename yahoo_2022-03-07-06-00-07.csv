We are halfway to our goal. Thank you for the support!"" Kutcher captioned the video on his account, along with the hashtag ""Stand with Ukraine."" The funds have since increased to over $16 million.

We're halfway through,"" said Kunis, who was born in the Ukrainian city of Chernivtsi in 1983. ""We're super-excited, and we want to say thank you to each and every single one of you. It's been an incredible past 48 hours."" After providing the update to their fundraising efforts, Kunis introduced Ryan Petersen, the creator of Flexport, and Brian Chesky, CEO of Airbnb, to speak further about where the donated funds are being channeled. Kutcher added that more than 30,000 people have already donated to the cause. ""We're halfway there. We're at $15 million, and we're heading to $30. We're going to make this happen,"" he said.

The That '70s Show actors first announced their GoFundMe project on Thursday, pledging to match up to $3 million in donations, Yahoo Entertainment previously reported. In a touching video, Kunis spoke about her Ukrainian heritage and her decision to help the country of her birth. ""I'm a proud American.

This unjust attack on Ukraine and humanity at large is devastating and the Ukrainian people need our support,"" she wrote. ""Our family is starting this fund to help provide immediate support and we will be matching up to $3 million dollars. While we are witnessing the bravery of Ukrainians, we are also bearing witness to the unimaginable burden of those who have chosen safety. Countless amounts of people have left everything they know and love behind to seek refuge. With nothing but what they could carry, these Ukrainian refugees are in need of housing and supplies right away.""
