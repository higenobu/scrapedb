4/19/2022,"Shanghai is preparing to ease its lockdown over the city’s 24 million people with authorities hoping transmissions will mostly be limited to quarantine facilities, as factories return to production in closed-loop systems, with Tesla staff reportedly told to sleep on site. Amid China’s worst outbreak since Wuhan, Shanghai continues to report tens of thousands of cases a day, with the majority among people in quarantine or isolation. On Monday Reuters reported officials had set a target of reaching “zero-Covid at the community level” by Wednesday. Currently, all positive cases must be isolated, mostly in mass dormitory-style warehouses, or in hospitals if treatment is required. Community-level zero-Covid will have been achieved once there is no more spread among the local population outside of quarantine and isolation facilities. Reaching such a target led to eased restrictions in other cities during recent outbreaks. The number of new local transmissions detected on Monday fell to 19,442 from 21,395 the previous day, with 550 cases found outside the quarantine zones, down from 561 the day before. Shanghai’s new target was communicated in a speech officially dated Saturday, to the city’s Communist party and organisations such as schools, according to Reuters’ sources, who declined to be named as the information was not public. China remains committed to its zero-Covid policy, despite the spread of the highly infectious Omicron strain across the country. “The Chinese population has a degree of immunity because of vaccination but not exposure to the virus, because they handled it so well,” said Prof Robert Booy, infectious diseases and vaccine expert from the University of Sydney. “The problem China has now is the Wuhan virus had a reproduction number of two, where the new ones have 12 or more. So it will be almost impossible to control despite the extraordinary efforts of quarantining millions of people at a time and testing them. It would be a miracle if they could control the virus despite their extremely fastidious approaches.” More than 340,000 cases have been reported since Shanghai’s outbreak began in March. This week city officials reported the first deaths officially attributed to the outbreak, including three on Sunday and seven on Monday. The lack of any reported Covid-19 fatalities despite more than 340,000 cases since March has drawn scepticism from experts over the high reporting threshold, particularly when compared to other countries. Booy said the deaths of people with Covid were still Covid deaths. “People who die with Covid die because of Covid… you can’t blame the death on the underlying problems,” he said. “It’s the combination of the two and that’s why you get so very very ill.” All deaths reported this week were of people aged between 60 and 101, with underlying conditions. Officials said the “direct cause” of the deaths had been their underlying conditions, but still recorded them against the outbreak. Prof Jin Dong-yan, a virologist at Hong Kong university, said Chinese health authorities did not usually count deaths from infectious diseases if there were underlying conditions, and that this had also been seen during past influenza seasons and the 2003 outbreak of Sars. “I don’t think they deliberately covered this up or want to play down this. It’s not true. They are just doing what they did in past years,” he said, adding that he could “only guess” why authorities decided to announce this week’s 10 fatalities. “They might be trying to tell the people that there are deaths.” However, Jin said at the same time officials were pointing at death rates in Hong Kong, which reports differently and has recorded almost 9,000 deaths in recent months, as a warning not to abandon zero-Covid policies like lockdowns. In Shanghai, the low official death toll has led to suspicion of the official narrative, as people claim deaths of family members in nursing homes and hospitals are not acknowledged, and media reports are censored. The lockdowns have caused major disruptions to daily life, and failures with the supply of food and other essentials have also sparked widespread frustration and anger. Businesses and factories across Shanghai have been shut or restricted for more than three weeks, with major impacts on production and supply chains, further exacerbated by closed roads and other pathways in and out of the city. Major companies including Tesla and Volkswagen are among 666 firms told they could restart production this week, under closed-loop management. A memo reportedly circulated at Tesla told employees they would have to sleep at the factory, with the company providing each with a sleeping bag and mattress, daily meals and a stipend. Drone footage taken by Chinese media appeared to show Tesla employees arriving at the factory on Tuesday with luggage, and several people moving the frame of a Tesla car around the site. Volkswagen, which restarted production at its Changchun factories after restrictions there eased, said it was still studying the feasibility of resuming production in Shanghai, Reuters reported.

4/19/2022,"Labor has promised an overhaul of the national disability insurance scheme’s appeals process as Bill Shorten launched a stinging attack on the leadership of the agency’s current boss, Martin Hoffman. Unveiling the opposition’s vision for the $30bn scheme on Tuesday, Shorten said if elected the party would hire another 380 agency staff and crack down on rorting providers and the NDIA’s use of consultants and private law firms. Shorten, Labor’s NDIS spokesman, said it was too early to say how much could be saved by cutting spending on consultants and the use of private law firms, on whom the agency has forked out $32m in the past eight months, up from $22m in 2020-21. Shorten was also highly critical of Hoffman, though he insisted “no final decisions” had been made about whether he would stay if Labor was elected. “You have to question the whole leadership of the NDIS in the last few years,” Shorten said. “That includes former chair Helen Nugent and Martin Hoffman. They presided over the independent assessments roll out which would have been a disaster and breached any remaining trust that people with disability had with the government. “I haven’t spoken to anyone in the disability sector who has a good word to say about Mr Hoffman. That doesn’t mean I’ve spoken to everyone. It would be premature to make definitive statements about people before the election.” Hoffman, who was appointed in November 2019, apologised in May over the agency’s and government’s attempts to establish “independent assessments” that advocates believed were aimed at cost-cutting. Since then, the agency has faced repeated claims that it is increasingly cutting the packages of NDIS participants through plan reviews, a claim it denies. Shorten said on Tuesday Labor would establish a new appeals process separate to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal process, which is facing massive delays after the number of appeals increased by 400%. Labor says the number of new appeals reflects increased cuts to NDIS packages, which the government disputes. Currently, NDIS participants who have had their plan cut or a support denied can ask for an internal review conducted by the NDIA, before taking it to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The massive increase in appeals has created a backlog at the AAT. Last year, NDIS participants could expect to wait about 23 weeks – or about five months – to have their AAT appeals, a wait which is likely to have increased further in recent months. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Shorten said the process proposed by Labor would mean people could avoid taking their complaint to the AAT after an internal review. “Bring in experts to conciliate and mediate between the agency and the individual participant and their representatives,” he said. He said this would offer a “lower cost form of mediation and conciliation”. Shorten did not rule out entirely the use of private law firms by the NDIA in AAT cases under Labor, but said it should be a “last resort”. “The feasting of private law firms on NDIS funds has got to stop,” he said. The agency has argued it uses private law firms to mediate with NDIS participants and data shows that only a fraction of AAT cases ever go to a contested hearing. However, advocates have claimed the process is “combative”. In a case revealed by Guardian Australia last month, the agency used the social media posts of a woman applying for the scheme to challenge her eligibility. Labor has also promised a broad review of the scheme’s design, operation and sustainability, which would be carried out through a “co-design” process with disability groups. Linda Reynolds, the NDIS minister, said the government was providing “record funding for disability services, which is only possible because we have a strong economy”. “The economic insecurity offered by an Anthony Albanese is a real risk to this record funding,” she said. “Labor’s introduction of an additional layer of bureaucracy with ‘expert reviews’ will slow down decisions for participants. Labor’s promise for yet another review, on top of all the previous reviews, will add more uncertainty for participants and providers.” Reynolds said the promise for 380 new NDIA staff needed to be “properly accounted for in Labor’s policy costings”. Labor says the new staff will cost $157.8m over four years. The Labor policy was welcomed by Laurie Leigh, chief executive of provider peak National Disability Services, and Children and Young People with Disability Australia chief executive Mary Sayers, who said plans to “streamline the NDIS, based on co-design are welcome”. “While there is a commitment for a National Autism Strategy, what is missing is a National Plan for Inclusive Education that covers all disability groups,” Sayers said. “Children and young people with disability are routinely excluded in their education, through suspensions, expulsions and gatekeeping where they are told they are not welcome at their local school.”",News/Australia news,Bill Shorten attacks NDIS boss as Labor promises $30bn overhaul,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/19/bill-shorten-attacks-ndis-boss-as-labor-promises-30bn-overhaul
4/19/2022,"Theo FennellMensch, £25, 277pp The jewellery designer’s memoir is drolly subtitled “Some Chapters of Accidents”. Reading his picaresque account of a life that has encompassed both success and far greater and more dispiriting failure, one would be forgiven for thinking that Fennell was a pariah, rather than an internationally respected figure. Yet this likably self-deprecating book details everything from his vain attempts to become a songwriter to the etiquette of dealing with some of London’s hardest criminals (“their dress sense was appalling”). It ends up being a highly amusing – even glittering – romp. Chloë AshbyTrapeze, £14.99, 316pp Ashby’s debut novel initially seems like a cross between Sally Rooney and Fleabag, but soon demonstrates its own quirky charisma. Protagonist Eve is a twentysomething Londoner who muddles her way through urban life, but is haunted by the death of her best friend, Grace. What marks Ashby out as a distinctive voice is the warmth and compassion with which she depicts her characters and their milieu. The spirited Eve has her faults, but you long for her to succeed on every page. Henry ManceVintage, £9.99, 387pp (paperback) The British famously dote on their animals. So why, asks Henry Mance in this absorbing and humorous polemic, so do we treat them so appallingly? The answer stems from both “tradition and inertia”, Mance suggests, but also because of our addiction to cheap, high-volume animal products that, if unchecked, will see the world fall to pieces in a vain attempt to supply the meat, dairy and leather that we crave.

4/19/2022,"This is a smarter-than-it-sounds sci-fi romcom, the kind Gen-Z kids would presumably dig. It sends a seemingly mismatched boy-girl couple – poor, hapless but good-hearted Walt (Cole Sprouse, from Riverdale) and super-competent but neurotic swot Sophie (Lana Condor from To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before) into space following their respective romantic partners who have already flown ahead to a much-coveted colony on Mars. So while the overall project is a heterosexual space-rom, along the way there are sprightly touches: thoughtful world-building (Earth, as in Wall-E has become one huge toxic garbage dump); snarky jabs at billionaire space entrepreneurs (Zach Braff co-stars as a capricious Elon Muskian tech overlord); and a cute lesbian couple with commitment issues (Cameron Esposito and Sunita Deshpande). Most welcome of all is the generous sprinkling of good one-liners thanks to screenwriter Max Taxe’s witty script, solid direction from Christopher Winterbauer, and a cast with nippy comic timing. Sprouse, who gets the lion’s share of screen time and most of the best lines, represents a particularly likable non-threatening-boy lead: himbo-handsome but not too much, pitching his performance right in the sweet spot between goofy and vulnerable. His Walt has wanted to join the space programme for years but has failed more than 30 times. When he falls in love with Ginny (Emily Rudd) the night before she flies to Mars, he decides with dumb romcom hero logic that the smartest thing to do would be to stow away on the next flight and force new acquaintance Sophie to help keep up the pretence that he’s her boyfriend Calvin (Mason Gooding) who’s actually already there. Arguably Taxe’s script relies a little too much on jokes about helpful yet sinister robots, like the passive-aggressive one named Gary that works with Walt in a coffee shop and keeps threatening to get him sacked. Mind you, one of them has a pretty funny line about how the consequences of forcing a boy and a girl human to share a room is “either one more human or one less!”  Moonshot is released on 25 April on digital platforms.",Arts/Film,Moonshot review – sprightly space romcom stows away to Mars,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/19/moonshot-review-sprightly-space-romcom-stows-away-to-mars
4/19/2022,"Not until you’ve listened to Rakim on a rocky mountaintop / Have you heard hip-hop,” mused poet/MC Saul Williams on his landmark 1998 polemic Twice the First Time, relocating the art form from the urban context that birthed it and challenging us to reconsider its possibilities. The startling and often brilliant sixth album from Sault is a similarly daring act of creative rebirth, swapping out the kaleidoscopic, razor-sharp funk/soul/rap/dub/whatever of their previous boundary-breaking work for an entirely new and unexpected paradigm. Though notorious for their love of mystery, it is now generally known that Sault are led by Dean Josiah Cover. Better known as Inflo, the producer of award-winning albums by Michael Kiwanuka and Little Simz, Cover will probably live comfortably off his contributions to Adele’s 30 for the rest of his years. Fittingly, the total volte-face of Air feels like the work of an artist who, having proved themselves within the pop realm, decides it’s time to pursue their grandest visions. Sault’s earlier music balanced shapeshifting, detail-perfect production with lyrics that translated the realities and revelations of the Black Lives Matter era – police brutality, systemic racism – into addictive, electric pop. Air, however, is mostly wordless, Sault’s regular collaborators – Kiwanuka, Simz, Cleo Sol and Kid Sister – absent. In their place are the voices of the Music Confectionery choir (who have previously sung with the likes of Ellie Goulding and Dave) alongside an ensemble arranged by Rosie Danvers of string-section Wired Strings. The music is orchestral and beatless, the group’s hitherto faultless grasp of groove consigned to the cupboard. Its seven pieces range in length between four and 13 minutes. There are few precedents for the music of Air within Cover’s previous output – perhaps the spacey, unhurried glide of Kiwanuka’s Black Man in a White World at a stretch. Unabashedly widescreen and cinematic, Air’s gracefully expressive symphonies and bold use of the choir-as-instrument suggest classic scores by Herrmann and Morricone, its dramas writ larger-than-life. Elements of minimalism and contemporary classical surface, as do African and eastern influences – in particular, the electric interplay between orchestra, chants and strummed and plucked stringed instruments on Luos Higher. More pointedly, Air harks back to a certain visionary era of Black music. Throughout, there are echoes of Alice Coltrane’s string-laden spiritual epic World Galaxy and of McCoy Tyner’s under-appreciated excursion into choral jazz, Inner Voices. The deft maximalism channels late producer/arranger Charles Stepney’s work for soulful psychedelicists Rotary Connection, and especially Come to My Garden, the cosmic debut by Rotary Connection singer Minnie Riperton. Air places Cover firmly within this lineage, its questing, ambitious music possessed of similar courage and inspiration. Only one track, Time Is Precious, has lyrics: the celestial harmonies and symphonic wall of sound give way to a soulful vocal group singing a simple but affecting message to not waste “the only time you’ve got here”. The titles of the remaining tracks mostly deal in the elemental: Reality, Heart, Solar, Air. The music is unrepentantly uplifting, hopeful and escapist, but, like much creativity by Black artists in the Black Lives Matter era, the shadow of the reality it is attempting to escape – and the knowledge of the injustices its essential sense of optimism is seeking to overcome – lend Air a deeper resonance. The music often unabashedly emotional, the blossoming horns of Heart – equal parts rousing anthem and swooning Motown ballad – sounding notes of cautious optimism. Cover’s considerable ambitions peak on the epic Solar. Across 13 riveting minutes, it draws into its orbit repetitive synth arpeggios and inventive choral work suggesting Terry Riley’s A Rainbow in Curved Air and North Star-era Philip Glass; soprano voices singing melodies that evoke John Coltrane’s Naima; and passages of star-gazing orchestral music that recall the sublime, soulful gospel of Donny Hathaway’s I Love the Lord, He Heard My Cry. This fusion of unlikely elements creates an earthy pocket-concerto that’s cerebral and creatively adventurous while harbouring potent emotional power. It’s a trick Air pulls off again and again. There was little within Sault’s first five albums to prepare the listener for what occurs here, and with such bold creative risks come the inevitable backlash. But Air eminently repays those risks. This is music for the rocky mountaintop that invites the listener to place themselves in the humbling context of a wider cosmos. Following a compass resolutely his own, Air sees Cover ascend to the realm of the similarly spiritual visionary Kamasi Washington. Where that compass takes him next, only a fool would guess – but the wise will follow.",Arts/Music,Sault: Air review – a daring act of creative rebirth pays off,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/19/sault-air-review-a-daring-act-of-creative-rebirth-pays-off
4/19/2022,"Australia’s Catholic bishops have called for a special intake of 20,000 refugees from Afghanistan, saying the country has a “moral duty” to do more. As part of its election statement, the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference said the country had an obligation to take more refugees from Afghanistan because of the support shown to Australian military forces. “The situation in Afghanistan demands a special intake of at least 20,000 additional places,” the statement says. “We have a moral duty towards those who supported Australian military forces as interpreters or in other capacities.” The statement also calls for a special intake of Ukrainian refugees, saying they require “similar mercy”. “Refugees and asylum-seekers fleeing persecution, violence or life-threatening poverty, and people who have been displaced by climate change, are our sisters and brothers.” The bishops called for a wider reassessment of refugee policies, saying the people fleeing violence or persecution have a “moral claim on our assistance, whether they fit legal definitions of a refugee or not”. “We need a just, humane and timely system for assessing claims for asylum.” The NSW Jewish Board of Deputies backed the call for a special intake, with its CEO, Darren Bark, and the Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-CEO, Peter Wertheim, saying they “wholeheartedly agree”. “We commend the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference for its powerful statement that ‘we are one human family’, and wholeheartedly agree that anyone fleeing persecution and physical danger deserves immediate assistance.” The Australian National Imams Council has backed the call for a greater intake of asylum seekers from Afghanistan. Spokesperson Ibrahim Dadoun told the Guardian the council agreed that Australia had a “moral duty” towards Afghan asylum seekers. “In return, the Australian government should not only provide more spaces for refugees, but to also support Afghans through humanitarian or medical aid.” Dadoun said the imams council also supported a broader increase in the humanitarian intake program. “Australia is a very large nation, and I’m sure we can easily absorb more asylum seekers very quickly. Just as we saw in Europe, where many countries absorbed the large influx of Ukrainian refugees, we can also do the same. It’s not far-fetched.” The Morrison government has increased its allocation of humanitarian places for Afghan nationals to 16,500 over the next four years. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The announcement came as part of the federal budget in March, with officials confirming the intake was on top of the 13,750 “ceiling” for the annual humanitarian program. At the time, the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, said the move was in “recognition” of Australia’s two decades of operations in Afghanistan. Hawke said the total number of places available to Afghan nationals had increased to 31,500 over the next four years, which also included the 10,000 places already pledged within the existing humanitarian program, and the 5,000 previously announced places in the permanent stream, such as for family members. But the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference insists a special intake is a necessary reflection of Australia’s investment in Afghanistan. The election statement also calls for religious freedom laws that would allow faith groups the freedom to run schools, social welfare, hospitals and aged care facilities “on the basis of their faith-inspired mission”. “It is essential for the wellbeing of our society for Australians of all ­religious faiths, or none, to have the religious freedom to practise their beliefs,” it says.

The bishops call for “commonsense protections” for religious groups that wouldn’t “privilege the rights of people of faith in Australia above the rights of other Australians”. “We call only for the same level of protections against discrimination on the basis of religion that Australia already has on the basis of race, sex or age.” Among a host of other issues, the bishops also call for a rise in jobseeker payments, an endorsement of the Uluru Statement from the Heart, and a wage rise for aged care workers. The statement does not throw its support behind any party, with group president, Archbishop Mark Coleridge, saying none of the parties embodied “Catholic social teaching”. “The bishops are, however, ­offering an election statement to encourage Catholics and people of goodwill to reflect on the good they can do for their community by using their vote for the good of all,” he said.",News/World news,"Australia has ‘moral duty’ to take 20,000 more Afghan refugees, Catholic bishops say",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/19/australia-has-moral-duty-to-take-20000-more-afghan-refugees-catholic-bishops-say
4/19/2022,"I am a 22-year-old male and I’m very confused about my sexuality. I don’t know if I’m gay, straight or bi. I have had sex with women and I enjoy it, but generally I don’t find myself massively aroused. I am concerned I might be gay, though: I sometimes find I’m thinking about men, and looking at them when I’m out and about. That said, I have watched gay porn and it doesn’t turn me on. Nor does lesbian porn – only straight porn works. Please help me – this has been an ongoing problem since I was 16 and I am finding each day a struggle. I just want to know what I am! You are at a very early stage of sexual self-discovery. Most people go through a period of anxiety over the questions “Who am I sexually?” and “Am I normal?” In fact, these questions can only elicit artificial answers, since fully knowing oneself can be a very long process involving a great deal of experimentation. And when it comes to sex, “normality” is not really a useful construct. Instead, of obsessing about ‘Who am I’, ask yourself why you feel the need to label yourself at all. Try to inoculate yourself from the ubiquitous societal tendency to pigeonhole – and focus instead on responding to your true desire for a person of any gender when it arises. Allow yourself to seek genuine human connection and pure pleasure without self judgment or fear of being judged.

4/19/2022,"Maybe it was the sight of Rory Burns’s magnificent mane of brown hair, bouncing behind him as he trundled up to the wicket to deliver a tame dobbler against Warwickshire. Perhaps it was Sir Alastair Cook against Glamorgan, sporting an impish grin as he approached the crease at an angle, his arms fanned out and bent at the elbow before serving a ball high on humour but lacking any bite. It could have been Michael Burgess’s 178 from No 8 at Edgbaston against Surrey in the opening round of the County Championship season. Or it was the drawn match in Derby a week later that saw Cheteshwar Pujara, Shan Masood and Tom Haines all register double tons. Then again it might have been any of the other 32 centuries scored across eight days of domestic cricket. Whatever prompted it, a counterintuitive idea spilled over the horizon and opened our eyes to its inarguable truth: batting in April in England isn’t so difficult after all. “Growing up I took it as fact that you didn’t want to be an opening batsman in April,” says Nick Browne, who scored 107 at the top of the order for Essex on the season’s first day at Chelmsford. “I reckon most people believed that when they first came through. The numbers say otherwise, don’t they?” Indeed they do. Since 2015, there have been more hundreds scored per game – 1.58 – than any other month in the year. Since 2002 teams have averaged 30.04 runs per wicket, a mere 0.96 runs per wicket less than the most productive month of July. Batting in the final innings is empirically less challenging in April where batters coming in from one to six averaged almost 35 – more than any other month – over the last 20 years. The avalanche of stats goes on. Several reasons have been offered. Burgess, who also keeps wicket for Warwickshire, says that the pitches are at their best at the start of the season: “People think they’re green, which they can be, but the groundsmen have been working on them for months. They’re great. Apart from being a little slower than they would be in the summer, they’re great.” That slowness, though, is helpful to batters. Any lateral movement extracted is more easily covered. If the edge is found the ball is less likely to carry to the slip cordon or to the wicketkeeper. Both Browne and Burgess said that they witnessed several balls landing just short of the catchers behind the stumps last week. Those that do reach the cordon need to be held by hands stiff from cold. Both batters also claimed to be more watchful at the start of the campaign. “You don’t want to be the guy who nicks off from a booming drive in April,” Browne says. “You do see guys play with softer hands early on,” says Tim Murtagh, Middlesex’s captain and opening bowler. “I don’t really change my approach as a result. We’re still looking to hit the top of off stump and make them play but they can be less adventurous. For me, it’s more about getting through my overs and getting some miles in the legs.” A lack of match preparation is another variable that tilts the scales towards batters in April. “There’s no proper way to replicate those overs,” says Hampshire’s Kyle Abbott, who arrived in the UK from South Africa in 2017 believing that bowling in April would be a dream. “I thought I could just turn my arm over and take a bag of wickets. It’s not like that. It’s a long season and you have to pace yourself. You start off looking for rhythm. You don’t always have it right away.” This may be a result of the winter work conducted on hard indoor nets or away in some sunny country. For Ben Sanderson, whose nine for 132 for Northamptonshire against Gloucestershire was the best match return of any bowler in the opening round, pre-season training can have an adverse effect on seam bowlers. “I’ve found that I need a bit of time to rediscover that line and length that works on the county circuit,” Sanderson explains. “On harder pitches you bowl short of a length and even though you know it’s not necessarily helping you prep for the English season, you still look to hit that length. Over here you’re almost bowling half-volleys by comparison. When I came back I had to relearn some things. It’s not necessarily a problem the batsmen have.” There is also the psychological component to batting to consider. “Everyone’s nervous and eager to hit the ground running,” Murtagh says, “but batters aren’t scarred by failures yet. Maybe in June or July they’ve had a bad run, they’re struggling for big scores, they’re overthinking their techniques or stance. The start of a season is a clean slate.” Browne agrees. “This was the first time I started the year without worrying about my score,” he says. “I just went out there [with Cook, who scored 100 in a 220-run opening stand] and focused on each ball. I know that’s something we should always do, but I felt relaxed. Talk to me at the end of the month though. I’m not sure I’m ‘Team April’ just yet.”",Sport/Sport,April the kindest month as county batters pile up the centuries,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/19/april-the-kindest-month-as-county-batters-pile-up-the-centuries
