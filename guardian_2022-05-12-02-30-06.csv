5/12/2022,"Ukrainian families could potentially be housed with a host who has failed a DBS check, a council has warned, as the government’s Homes for Ukraine scheme continues to face a range of problems. William Benson, the chief executive of Tunbridge Wells borough council, said that if a host failed a DBS check, or their home was deemed unsuitable for the scheme, they would not necessarily be prevented from hosting a Ukrainian refugee as these two processes “run parallel to each other”. He added that refugees were matched to hosts before the DBS check process began. Benson said: “One of the big outstanding issues is that we do not yet know what we do if a host fails a DBS, or a house check. So under what power do we remove someone who has had a pretty traumatic experience coming over here? “There is a potential that a guest is on their way, or has arrived, to be hosted in a house that we don’t believe is suitable.” After a Ukrainian refugee is matched with a host, Kent county council performs the DBS check and Tunbridge Wells borough council performs the check to see whether the house is suitable. But, according to Benson, because they are “separate processes, it is entirely possible that the guests could have had their visa approved and have arrived in a home that we don’t believe is suitable”. Benson has called for more guidance from the central government regarding what to do in such potential cases. Kent county council has also expressed concern regarding the lack of provision made for people coming to the UK through the Ukraine family scheme, which allows applicants to join immediate family members based in the UK, rather than through Homes for Ukraine. “We still retain concern about the operation of the family scheme,” said Roger Gough, the leader of Kent county council. “On one side, regarding the Homes for Ukraine scheme, there is clarity of how it should work, and there is government funding. On the side of those coming via the family route, there is nothing. And equally, it is also not clear what happens if those relationships break down and people come into the system needing rematching.” According to Gough, there have been instances of family breakdowns and of Ukrainians coming to the UK through the families scheme and later presenting to the council as homeless. In one particular case, a person who occupied a room in a shared house signed up to host four people under the family scheme, who then had to be rehoused due to the unsuitability of the accommodation. Kent has seen around 7,000 households register interest in becoming a host under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, and of these, 1,104 have been matched with Ukrainian refugees so far. The Homes for Ukraine scheme has faced a myriad of problems since its launch. Most recently the government had to rehouse hundreds of Ukrainians granted visas because the people they were supposed to stay with had been deemed “unsuitable”. The Home Office has been approached for comment.",News/UK news,"Ukrainian refugee families could get host who failed DBS check, says council",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/11/ukrainian-refugee-families-could-get-host-who-failed-dbs-check-says-council
5/12/2022,"The UN climate envoy Mark Carney has warned against deferring emissions reduction targets in reaction to the energy crisis linked to the war in Ukraine, saying it will only require more “radical” action in the future. The former Bank of England governor said he recognised the impact sanctions on Russia were having on global energy supplies and the cost of living, but added that governments could not afford to derail climate progress that could help achieve the 1.5C limit on global heating. “European energy markets have ruptured, with negative spill overs around the globe,” Carney said in a speech at the Net Zero Delivery Summit in London. “Households in developed economies are facing crippling energy bills, and across the developing world, the grind of energy poverty is worsening. And all the while, the climate crisis grows, building future costs that will dwarf current hardships,” he added. Carney said efforts to find alternatives to Russian oil were resulting in higher emissions in the near-term, “and leading some … to argue to temporarily set aside our climate goals”. “But we know the climate doesn’t care why emissions happen, only how much occur. The more we emit now, the more radical action will be needed later. We need to speed up, not slow down,” he said. Carney stopped short of naming groups that may put climate targets under threat. However, his comments came after Conservative MPs and peers in the Net Zero Scrutiny Group tried to link the government’s climate agenda to the cost of living crisis and called for cuts to green taxes and an increase in fossil fuel production. But any attempt to delay net zero targets – at least in the UK – would mean breaching or repealing the 2008 Climate Change Act. Under the act, British governments must set five-year carbon budgets that stretch beyond the term of the current parliament. The UK’s carbon budget, its sixth, runs to 2035. Some companies have warned about their own ability to meet self-imposed climate targets in light of the Ukraine war. In March, Barclays said the effects of the invasion could impact its efforts to slash emissions, as it strives to achieve net zero by 2050. Nearly 20% of shareholders subsequently rejected its climate strategy after an annual general meeting that was disrupted by activists protesting against its financing of fossil fuels. But Carney said that, contrary to calls for a delay to climate targets, the Russian invasion should spark further investments in green energy. “Russia’s war underscored that a resilient system needs more diversified and reliable suppliers – the price of greater security of supply in the near terms will be more stranded assets over the medium term,” he said. “Once built, clean energy systems are more affordable, efficient, resilient and reliable. No one owns the wind or the sun and hydrogen is literally everywhere.”",News/Environment,"Do not use Ukraine war to defer climate goals, warns Mark Carney",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/11/do-not-use-ukraine-war-to-defer-climate-goals-warns-mark-carney-energy-crisis
5/12/2022,"Fear not, Tom Brady will remain the face of Sundays for the foreseeable future. Fox announced on Tuesday that Brady is set to join the network as its lead NFL analyst whenever it is that he decides to retire – which could be in 2023 … or 2063. The New York Post reported that Brady is in line to receive $375m across 10 years. The deal will make Brady the highest paid sports broadcaster by some distance. It’s twice the record-breaking amount CBS handed to Tony Romo in 2020, and almost three times as much as the Disney company pays Stephen A Smith to function as a one-person network over at ESPN. In fact, it’s a contract that would make Brady the eighth highest-paid player in the NFL. He is, in essence, leaving $15m on the table this year so that he can keep playing football for the Bucs. The figures are jarring. You have to hand it to him, Brady seems intent to earn back every cent he left on the football table when penning team-friendly deal after team-friendly deal in New England. It’s a move that represents where sports broadcasting is heading. As recently as five years ago, the game’s most decorated star leaving the field to take a job calling games from the booth would have been beneath Brady’s station. Now, being a lead NFL analyst, working 20 on-air days a year, earning a salary that matches or betters the game’s top players, is a cushy, comfortable, lucrative, part-time gig. In the streaming age, live sports are king. And holding onto those live sporting rights is everything. The timing of the announcement was telling. It was not released with a glossy media packet or via a social media push. It was announced by Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch during an investor call. Make no mistake, this was a move for investors, not viewers. For those who invest in Fox’s publicly traded stock, and those who invest in buying ad time on Fox Sports. Announcers do not shift the metrics on games. No one tunes in or out (in big enough numbers to make a difference) on any given matchup because of who or how a game is called. The game is the attraction, the announcers just help elevate or deflate the atmosphere. Talking on the South Beach Session podcast, John Skipper, the former head of ESPN, said that internal data at the company showed who was calling the game made little difference to audience figures. “I never saw a scintilla of evidence that the people in the booth changed the ratings even by a smidgen,” Skipper said. “The race to hire people is mostly about internal pride.” Hiring famous faces to yap about games is about prestige and ego. The hope for Fox is that Tom Brady being Tom Brady will sprinkle stardust on the network, attracting a couple of extra million dollars in ad revenue here and there from executives who just want to get in the room with Tom Bleeping Brady, no matter what the audience numbers say. Most importantly it helps maintain a company’s standing with the league. With Amazon having fully entered the NFL rights world, the rest of the legacy outfits are jockeying for position to make sure they’re not cut out of any future NFL rights deal as more games and more broadcasts are handed to the Bezos-backed upstart. And that’s why salaries have ballooned since Romo signed his $17m per year extension with CBS, kicking off this summer’s arms race: Al Michaels and Kirk Herbstreit joining Amazon; Buck and Aikman moving to ESPN; Fox landing Brady. Hiring famous people does not necessarily help or improve the broadcast – often it does the opposite. But hiring famous people helps the broadcast network maintain its rights package. For what constitutes pennies on the overall Fox Corp balance sheet, Brady will help future-proof the company against streaming companies eating into their rights package, the loss of which would cost billions. With none of the legacy partners wanting to be left holding the bag, networks have doubled down on big names and quarterbacks in the booth. What position did they play? Who did they play for? There is a reason former Dallas Cowboys – Romo; Jason Witten – are offered the chance to skip the line. It’s about name recognition over talent or experience. If you were, say, Amazon Sports, with an unlimited budget, looking to build the most compelling broadcast, would you not try something different, something creative? Would the Gusgasm, in all its viral glory, not be at the top of your wants list? How about Aqib Talib, the most interesting voice currently on NFL broadcasts? Has he not earned one of the top chairs at a network? And where’s the pipeline of Hall of Fame tackles, who can analyze, in real time, what’s going on at the line of scrimmage, the area of the field that most often decides games? Instead, Amazon settled for the tried-and-true formula. It chose not to take any risks, either to break the traditional construct of an in-game booth or to build around fresh names. It chose Al Michaels, still the best play-by-play announcer in the game even as he nears 80. And then it offered around a package to any of the advert-getting names in the business, settling on college football’s premier voice because of his Q Score. If nothing else, Brady’s elevation directly to the top booth of a typically stale, typically white broadcasts confirms that the networks continue to view the old way as The Way. There will be little to no innovation. It will be two guys – sometimes three – in a booth: The over-eager announcer; the thanks-for-the-check ex-player. Even as companies and sports scramble to try to replicate the success of the ManningCast, it will still serve as the second or third option. It’s a neat side project, something to show the cool kids on social media that you’re trying to be different. The real show, the ad-backed show, the investor-backed show, the show for an audience of 32 NFL owners, will still feature a Hall of Famer, likely one who played with a star on the side of his helmet, or who has enough rings to cover two hands. What kind of announcer will Brady be? Early Romo set the standard for modern in-game analysts with his infectious enthusiasm and gift for predicting plays. He knew the players and schemes around the league intimately having just stepped off the field, and relished sharing his knowledge with the viewing public. Brady will walk into the booth with a similar command, whether he has the through-the-mic charm is open for debate. After 23 years in the league, he appears comfortable in his own skin. Outside of the Patriots cult of no-personality, Brady has bared his teeth a little and has made his personality more public. He has as much on-camera experience as any player attempting the move. He just wrapped up a 10-part infomercial for ESPN. The most interesting analysis during NFL Films’ 100-year anniversary series came with Brady breaking down plays alongside Bill Belichick. Watching and dissecting plays in real-time is a different deal, though, requiring a different skill set. But this is Tom Brady, walking football machine. The job is to talk about and analyze football, and he’s pretty good at that. Brady has no contemporary in the media space, save, perhaps, for Peyton Manning. He is the most famous celebrity the game has produced, one of the few who crosses continents and sports. He is also the most important and impactful player of the last 20 years. People will want to hear what he has to say. Stepping from the field to the booth should mean he can offer some Romo-esque insights from the jump. And by handing him the biggest contract in sports media history, Fox has locked in its own NFL future. Some Hall of Famers retire into the grind of coaching or the executive life. Some shill copper bands or the Itch Stopper. Brady will stay selling Football and Sundays – and will be paid like Russell Wilson to do so. As always, the NFL’s ultimate winner stays winning.",Sport/Sport,Tom Brady’s historic $375m Fox Sports deal shows familiarity breeds content,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/11/tom-brady-tv-deal-fox-sports-nfl-
5/12/2022,"The Football Association is working with the Premier League and English Football League to limit so-called leveraged takeovers of clubs, Mark Bullingham has said. The FA’s chief executive wants limits on the money a prospective owner can borrow against the assets of a club, a move that might have prevented the takeover of Manchester United by the Glazer family or ALK Capital’s deal for Burnley. It comes as the FA continues to jockey for position over the placement of an independent regulator for English football. “The thing to look at in future ownership structures is the way in which the debt is structured to purchase a club and making sure there’s enough security around that,” Bullingham said. “It’s the extent to which the buyer has leveraged [which] is important; that clubs are sustainable and secure moving forward. “It is something that we are looking at, and I know the leagues are as well, to make sure that that whole area is explored in any new ownership model moving forward. I think it absolutely is something that will be explored [by a new regulator].” The Glazers’ ownership of United has been the subject of renewed protests, 17 years after their takeover with a loan secured against the club’s assets, which has generated more than £1.5bn of interest. Burnley’s annual accounts recently revealed that, in the event of relegation, they would be obliged to make a “significant” repayment on more than £100m of debt placed on the club by the owners. Bullingham believes the FA is a suitable place to house the new independent regulator, plans for which were confirmed in the Queen’s speech this week. “We think we can give government a really strong argument as to how that regulator could sit alongside the FA,” he said. “I think we see the advantages that we can [bring], and we can intertwine it with the regulatory aspects that we do, but anybody would need to have a large degree of independence. So there’s a lot still to work through and it will be up to [government] to decide.” Bullingham was speaking after Uefa’s annual Congress, which approved wide-ranging changes to the Champions League and other continental competitions. Uefa’s president, Aleksander Ceferin, celebrated the agreement, which involved consultation with clubs, national associations and, for the first time, supporter groups. He told delegates from 55 member nations: “When we stand together … football wins and society wins as well,” before turning his fire on the hold-out clubs from last year’s failed Super League. “I am not in touch with any of the three clubs,” Ceferin said of Juventus, Barcelona and Real Madrid, who are pursuing a legal case against Uefa through the European court of justice. “It’s up to them to ask for a meeting, not for me to ask them. The only greeting we get is from the courts from time to time, or some threats. The usual stuff which we are not nervous about.” Ceferin admitted he would probably sit next to Madrid’s president, Florentino Pérez, at the Champions League final on 28 May. He also said he had called Jürgen Klopp to address the Liverpool manager’s complaint over how tickets to the game are distributed. Madrid and Liverpool fans will have 20,000 tickets each in Paris, with the remaining 35,000 distributed by Uefa. Klopp said the distribution was “about money”, something Ceferin said he had disputed. “If sponsors that pay 100, or more, million euros sponsorship get some tickets, it’s part of a contractual obligation that we have,” he said. “Some tickets go to the market, some tickets go to the fans and some go to the partners. It’s not Uefa. I’m not giving tickets for free to my friends or selling to my friends. From the revenues from the finals, Uefa gets 6.5% and 93.5% goes to the clubs. It’s the system that works, and clubs couldn’t function differently.”",Sport/Football,FA working with leagues to tackle leveraged takeovers of clubs,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/11/fa-working-with-leagues-to-tackle-leveraged-takeovers-of-clubs
5/12/2022,"Many horses were struggling to quicken on the ground here on Wednesday but Emily Upjohn was emphatically not among them. John and Thady Gosden’s filly shot away from her field with a sustained burst of speed two out in the Musidora Stakes, eventually crossing the line five-and-a-half lengths clear of Life Of Dreams, and is now clear favourite at around 6-4 for the Oaks on 3 June. This was a seventh Musidora winner for the Gosden stable and the record of the previous six in the Classic at Epsom a few weeks later is uninspiring, with the only three fillies that went on to run in the Oaks all beaten. Everything about Emily Upjohn’s win here suggested she will be the one to break the sequence, however, as the step up to a mile-and-a-half is likely to see further improvement from a filly with stamina on both sides of her pedigree. “A mile-and-a-half will be right up her alley and she couldn’t have done it any better, really,” John Gosden said afterwards. “That’s probably where she’ll stay after this. She’s very well balanced but there’s no reason we won’t go to the breakfast at Epsom [on 23 May], have a canter round the track there and see how she handles it. She likes to show off and enjoy herself but I thought she settled beautifully after a furlong. We’ve been lucky enough to win [the Oaks] three times and she very much deserves to be in that league.” Frankie Dettori, Emily Upjohn’s jockey, suggested the winner is at a similar point at this stage of her career to Enable, the 2017 Oaks winner, who went on to take 11 Group One races in all. “The ground is a lot deeper than you think,” Dettori said, “and everybody was struggling from four out. I kept her together and from the two-and-a-half to the winning post I didn’t see another horse. “Enable won at Chester [before winning the Oaks] and she was probably on the same par. Every race she’s improving, she won by five lengths and I’m delighted with her.” Tuesday, who finished third in the 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket when making only the third start of her career, is the 4-1 second favourite for the Oaks while Charlie Appleby’s With The Moonlight, the Pretty Polly Stakes winner, is a 9-1 shot and the only other likely runner at single-figure odds.

Desert Crown has already shortened from 33-1 to 6-1 second-favourite for the Derby in the past 10 days without leaving Newmarket, as other potential candidates have come up short in their trials. El Bodegon, meanwhile, beat Stone Age in a Group One at St Cloud in October, and both Magisterial, a maiden winner at Leicester last month, and Aidan O’Brien’s Bluegrass also have the right profile to jump towards the top of the ante-post market with a victory. Desert Crown (3.35), however, already looks like more than a talking horse, as his winning time in a five-and-a-half length stroll on debut at Nottingham last November marked him down as Group-class colt in the making. Odds of around 3-1 look fair for Sir Michael Stoute’s colt to punch his ticket to Epsom. York 1.50 Copper Knight is going for his third straight success in this race but needs a career-best at the age of eight to win off 104, so Strong Power makes more appeal at around 12-1. Much improved on the all-weather this winter after joining Alice Haynes, he raced off 95 on his latest start in early April but runs off his 8lb lower turf mark here. Salisbury 2.05 Teumessias Fox starts out in handicaps on a mark of 84 and that looks workable based on his wide-margin success at Newcastle in early March. York 2.25 Little to choose between the three principals – Thunder Kiss, Noon Star and Ville De Grace – but the latter’s success in the Group Three Pride Stakes in October came in a strongly run contest and she may just have the edge at this trip. York 3.00 La Trinidad rarely runs a bad race in big-field handicaps over this track and trip, and a return to the form of his victory in a similar contest last July – off a 4lb lower mark – could well be enough for a third career win on the Knavesmire.

5/12/2022,"Two British men who spent time in detention in the United Arab Emirates have testified in Paris that an Emirati security official who is now the president of Interpol was responsible for their alleged torture. Matthew Hedges, an academic imprisoned in the UAE for seven months on espionage charges he denies, and Ali Issa Ahmad, who was detained in Dubai for wearing a Qatar football shirt, testified before the investigating judge of the specialised judicial unit for crimes against humanity and war crimes of the Paris tribunal. The pair allege that Maj Gen Ahmed Naser al-Raisi was personally responsible for the torture to which they were subjected while in detention. “I told the judge about all the terrible things that happened to me when I was arrested in the UAE, about being cut on my body, punched by police officers, and all the other torture I suffered. This includes why I believe that al-Raisi is to blame, as he was the chief of the police and the prison service and so there was no way he didn’t know what was happening to me,” Ahmad told the Guardian after giving testimony. The Emirati foreign ministry did not respond when contacted for comment. The UAE has previously denied the allegations. The former detainees’ testimony represents a step forward in an ongoing investigation into Raisi’s conduct prior to his election as Interpol president, and an unusual consequence of his assuming the presidency. While lawyers for Hedges and Ahmad have filed charges against him in the UK, Sweden, Norway, Turkey and France, it was only because Raisi is now required to regularly visit the Interpol headquarters in Lyon and therefore set foot on French soil that judges in Paris could proceed to investigate the charges against him. “He shouldn’t have been elected into position, but it means as a result that he’s now subject to investigation and potentially prosecution,” said Rodney Dixon QC, who represents Hedges and Ahmad. “What will be important is when al-Raisi is due to return to Lyon, because when that happens we then have to assess where the investigation is at that point and whether steps will be taken to question him.” Hedges described the experience of testifying about his treatment in the UAE as “empowering”. “It feels significant and impactful to be testifying in France,” he said. “I’m happy to have testified here as al-Raisi is required to travel to France as the president of Interpol, which gives me more hope. I also hope that there will be enough evidence to advance criminal proceedings against him, which would add further weight to the questions asked about him becoming president of Interpol in the first place.” Observers claim Raisi does not benefit from immunity in his position as Interpol president, leaving him open to police questioning, an unusual event that would be expected to embarrass the institution. “He doesn’t enjoy immunity under French law, and the fact this investigation has begun is testament to that,” Dixon said. Prosecutors in Paris have been approached for comment. An Interpol spokesperson said the allegations related to “an issue between the parties involved, and given this is an ongoing matter it would be premature for Interpol to comment”. Interpol is a supranational policing organisation that focuses primarily on information sharing between member states. The organisation has drawn criticism for the increasing role played by anti-democratic regimes, notably their abuse of Interpol’s red notice system to flag political exiles rather than criminals. The complaint against Raisi, alongside a second complaint in Paris filed by the Gulf Centre for Human Rights over Raisi’s alleged role in the detention and torture of an Emirati rights activist, Ahmed Mansoor, was filed under the principle of universal jurisdiction for grievous crimes. In recent years the same principle has been used in German courts to convict former Syrian intelligence officers of crimes against humanity for the murder and torture of detainees in a Damascus detention facility. The same Paris court that heard Hedges’ and Ahmad’s testimonies began the trial of a senior civil servant from Rwanda this week, accusing him of complicity in the 1994 genocide. “I think we’ll see more of these cases that show how clearly European governments, including France, are keen on their autocratic counterparts either for security cooperation or business deals, while in parallel seeing judicial activism to go after people for human rights violations, war crimes and torture,” said Nadim Houry, the head of the Arab Reform Initiative, a Paris thinktank. “It’s interesting that no one sufficiently cared about these allegations before they voted in al-Raisi as head of Interpol,” he added. “If these allegations are proven in a court of law, what does this say about Interpol?” France has enjoyed unusually strong relations with the UAE under the presidency of Emmanuel Macron, including deep political and military ties. Last December Paris agreed to sell to the UAE 80 upgraded Rafale fighter jets and 12 combat helicopters worth £13.64bn, the largest ever French weapons sale for export. Jalel Harchaoui, a Paris-based analyst of Emirati-French relations, said: “The Élysée under Macron has really considered tight friendship with Abu Dhabi as sacrosanct.” He said the possible questioning of Raisi during his next visit to France appeared unlikely to shake relations between the two nations. “The relationship is a direct dialogue between Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed and Emmanuel Macron. So while Abu Dhabi maybe considers it unfortunate that western liberal democracies have an independent justice system, that’s also part of the cost of doing business.”",News/World news,Two Britons testify against Interpol chief in UAE torture claim,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/two-britons-testify-against-interpol-chief-in-uae-torture-claim
5/12/2022,"The Conservative MP Lee Anderson has been condemned by opposition MPs and campaigners after arguing in the Commons that food banks are largely unnecessary because the main cause of food poverty is a lack of cooking and budgetary skills. The comments by the MP for Ashfield in Nottinghamshire also prompted veiled criticism from a fellow Tory, Stephen Crabb, the former work and pensions secretary. Speaking in the Queen’s speech debate on Wednesday, Anderson also said that nutritious meals could be easily cooked for 30p a time. Anderson, who took the previously safe Labour seat for the Conservatives in the 2019 election, began by inviting opposition MPs to visit an unnamed food bank in his constituency, where he helps out. “When people come now for a food parcel, they have to register for a budgeting course and a cooking course,” Anderson said. “And what we do at the food bank, we teach them how to cook cheap and nutritious meals on a budget. We can make a meal for about 30p a day, which is cooking from scratch.” Questioned whether he even believed food banks were necessary, Anderson said that was “exactly my point”. He said: “I think you’ll see first-hand that there’s not this massive use for food banks in this country. You’ve got generation after generation who cannot cook properly. They can’t cook a meal from scratch. They cannot budget.” Liz Barrett, principal of the Academy Transformation Trust FE college, which runs the food bank Anderson has helped at, said that while many people assisted by the food bank were helped by courses in cookery and budgeting, others were simply “destitute”. “It’s a combination,” she said. “To be good with your food you need to be good with your money, and also be able to cook. If you can’t then the food doesn’t go as far as you can get into a very difficult cycle.” The link between the food bank and the college means that while people referred for assistance receive one-off help without conditions, those getting food over the longer term are asked to take a course, whether in cooking, budgets or job skills. Jack Monroe, the anti-poverty campaigner and budget cooking expert, said in a tweet: “You can’t cook meals from scratch with nothing. You can’t buy cheap food with nothing. “The issue is not ‘skills’, it’s 12 years of Conservative cuts to social support. The square root of fuck all is ALWAYS going to be fuck all, no matter how creatively you’re told to dice it.” Crabb, the Preseli Pembrokeshire MP who was work and pensions secretary in 2016, tweeted: “Conservatives tend to emphasise work, good budgeting/housekeeping, strong families etc as defences against hardship. “Problem right now for many people is that ticking all those boxes still doesn’t keep their heads above water. Government has done a lot but more is required.” Labour MP Karen Buck, the shadow work and pensions minister, said: “In the world where people actually live, we now hear daily heart-wrenching stories of families going without food and others unable to turn their ovens on for fear of rising energy bills. “The idea that the problem is cooking skills and not 12 years of government decisions that are pushing people into extreme poverty is beyond belief. ‘Out of touch’ doesn’t even cover it.” MP Wendy Chamberlain, the Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesperson, said: “These comments are disgraceful and an insult to millions of hard-working people who are struggling to put food on the table for their family through no fault of their own. “Lee Anderson should apologise straight away for his shameful and stigmatising remarks.” Anderson has often been a divisive figure during his relatively brief time in parliament. During last summer’s European Championship, he pledged to not watch England games over the decision of the team’s players to take the knee before matches as an anti-racism message.",News/UK news,Tory MP condemned after blaming food poverty on lack of cooking skills,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/11/tory-mp-condemned-after-blaming-food-poverty-on-lack-of-cooking-skills
5/12/2022,"Police believe a 15-year-old girl who disappeared from Bristol more than a fortnight ago after saying she was going to the shops has been abducted. Maddie Thomas went missing from the Southmead area, north of the city centre, where she lives with a foster family, on 26 April. Avon and Somerset police has become increasingly worried about the girl and officers now say they believe she has been abducted by a man. DI Laura Miller said: “We are no longer investigating Maddie’s disappearance as a missing person case but as a child abduction.” Maddie has gone missing before and been found as far away as London, Birmingham, Cardiff and Bedfordshire, typically after being contacted by men on the internet. Miller said: “When Maddie has previously gone missing she has been found in the company of adult men and it is mainly due to this history that we believe she is likely to currently be with someone. “Maddie is a child in foster care – no one has permission to keep her from her carers.

5/12/2022,"The family of the Dorset teenager Gaia Pope repeatedly urged police to search the clifftop spot where her body was finally found 11 days after she vanished but felt officers focused on other places, an inquest jury has heard. Relatives of Pope, who had severe epilepsy and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after revealing she had been raped when she was 16, told police they thought she would have gone to a spot of great sentimental importance to her called Dancing Ledge. Pope’s older sister, Clara Pope-Sutherland, told the court she even drew a sketch showing the spot where the 19-year-old went missing on Dancing Ledge. She said: “I drew a circle and said I am not a police officer, but this is the radius of where I would be searching. I believe inquiries were looking outside of that area.” Pope-Sutherland told the inquest in Bournemouth that the place was important to her sister because of its associations with her late grandfather, David Pope. She said: “Every single one of the family mentioned that Dancing Ledge was a place of very high significance. In my mind, it didn’t make much sense that she would be anywhere else other than trying to be there and being close with my grandfather. “I would have put my walking boots on and gone there myself. We were consistently advised by officers not to go into the countryside where it could be dangerous and where the police were handling the search.” Pope’s body was found in undergrowth on 18 November 2017 very close to Dancing Ledge. Pope-Sutherland said Gaia Pope was “bright, brave, kind creative and fiercely loyal”, interested in nature, art and science. She was “extremely loving and caring” even in her “darkest times” and hoped for a career in health and social care. She was diagnosed with epilepsy in 2013 when she was 14 or 15. The condition became worse and her family was frightened she could suddenly die in bed or in the bath if she had a seizure. “It was scary for her and very limiting,” Pope-Sutherland said. In December 2015, the court heard, Pope alleged that she had been raped 12 months before when she was 16. Pope-Sutherland said the teenager believed she had been drugged before being attacked. She said her sister recalled being given a cup of tea. “She didn’t remember much after that,” she said. Gaia Pope reported to police what had happened but did not feel she was being taken seriously. In November 2016 she was told that the alleged perpetrator was not going to be charged. “She was told the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] had looked at the case and decided there was no way they could go forward,” the witness said. Pope-Sutherland said the alleged perpetrator had threatened to kill Pope and her family if she spoke about what had happened. The man was later jailed for another sexual offence not connected to Pope. Her sister recalled a moment when she realised her attacker would be let out of jail, describing this a “ticking timebomb moment” and adding: “The thought of him really haunted her. She was very, very scared.” Her seizures became more severe and she suffered a mental health crisis. Pope-Sutherland said in the months before she died her sister was teetering on the “brink of an emergency” but the family did not believe she received the care she needed from mental health services. She said Pope felt that some health professionals did not believe her rape allegation. Jurors have been told that at the time of her disappearance, Pope was worried about the man’s imminent release. A few days before she vanished another man sent her sexually explicit images of himself. Pope-Sutherland said it triggered memories of the rape and she was due to speak to police about it on the day she went missing.

5/12/2022,"Lawmakers in the European parliament have called for a faster reduction in car pollution to accelerate the shift to electric vehicles in Europe. Last year the European Commission proposed an end to new cars powered by petrol or diesel by 2035, as part of its far-reaching green deal, the EU response to the climate crisis. In a vote on Wednesday, the European parliament’s environment committee backed that 2035 target, but said carmakers should meet an interim goal of a 20% reduction in carbon emissions by 2025 to speed up the shift from petrol and diesel. In a blow to green campaigners, an amendment proposing a target of a 75% reduction in emissions by 2030 was rejected. The vote is not final, but a crucial step ahead of negotiations between MEPs and ministers from the 27 EU member states. Carmakers currently have to ensure that their average fleet of new cars emits no more than 95 grams of C02 a kilometre. The equivalent target for vans is 147g CO2/km. The European parliament argued that carmakers need tougher short-term targets to reduce emissions “to accelerate the update of zero-emission vehicles”. To this end, MEPs proposed interim targets for 2025 and 2030. The commission had proposed a 55% reduction for cars and 50% for vans by 2030. Phasing out petrol and diesel cars is seen as a crucial component in cutting pollution from transport, the only economic sector where emissions have been rising. Road transport accounts for 20% of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions and fuels toxic air pollution. Cars and vans are the single largest source of nitrogen dioxide pollution, linked to the deaths of 40,400 people in the EU a year, according to the European Environment Agency. The car industry is also one of the EU’s biggest employers, supporting 14.6m direct and indirect jobs including manufacturing, sales and transport services. The proposals for tighter regulations are being closely watched by EU governments. To avoid economic hardship, the MEPs have urged the EU executive to create a special fund to help small and medium-sized firms that are dependent on manufacturing parts for internal combustion engine vehicles. Pascal Canfin, the centrist French MEP who chairs the environment committee, told reporters before the vote that a “just transition fund” totalling several billion euros would be needed. He said the sum was “not huge” for the EU, but necessary to support firms that faced “a massive shift of their business model”. The UK has promised to end the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2030, although hybrid models can still be produced until 2035, a significant concession for the car industry. The EU’s CO2 and cars regulation is one of a dozen proposals that make up the EU’s green deal. Other elements include an expansion of renewable energy, an overhaul of the EU emissions trading scheme that caps industrial pollution and a heavily criticised forest protection strategy. All the legal proposals must be agreed by the European parliament and EU council of ministers before coming into force, making the coming months a crunch period for the union’s green ambitions. In a sign of the political divisions over the EU green agenda, the CO2 and cars vote passed via a left-liberal-green coalition with 46 votes in favour, while 40 MEPs from the centre-right and nationalist parties voted against, and two abstained. The text will be voted on by the full European parliament in June. Campaigners urged the EU to set more demanding emissions-reduction targets to speed up the transition to electric vehicles by the end of the decade. “The EV boom will falter for the next 10 years unless lawmakers step in with an interim target in 2027 and a more ambitious goal in 2030, “ said Alex Keynes at Transport and Environment. “Without it, Europe may not sell enough zero-emissions cars to meet its own 2030 goals as well as those of many EU countries.”",News/Environment,MEPs call for 20% reduction in car emissions by 2025,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/11/european-parliament-car-emissions-reduction-interim-goal-2025
5/12/2022,"It’s a delicate moment for a chairman of Tesco, trying to describe reality while maintaining the brand-boosterism that someone in some distant MBA hell decided the shareholders demand. In an interview on the Today programme this week, John Allan, who is a former president of the CBI, dispensed entirely with the second imperative. He described what cashiers were saying to him: that customers were asking them to stop when they’d rung through £40. People are out of wriggle room. It was a crunchy, evocative description of how skint people are already, a tacit emphasis that this is everybody’s business, and a hint, if you chose to hear it, that this is unprecedented. So many phrases have sauntered casually into the vernacular, and we use them as though they’ve been there for ever: income squeeze; rate hikes; energy price spikes; the cost of living crisis. There’s nothing complicated about this new vocabulary, but it does give the impression that the events are technical or abstruse. It was quite striking to hear Allan humanise the matter – there is nothing complicated about it. There’s just a person, standing in front of a cashier, saying, “Stop when you get to £40, and let’s hope the essentials made it.” Even more striking, though, was that he went on to endorse a windfall tax on oil and gas companies. It is not a controversial point of view. You can split hairs on whether their profits are “obscene” but the entire fossil fuel industry combined wouldn’t deny that it’s all been a bit of a lucky strike, and that they’ve been half-expecting a windfall tax since their bonanza began. Yet if you’ve heard the notion before, it will have been from the Labour party; so the suggestion, being opposition policy, openly defies the government until such time as they U-turn and suggest it themselves. The owners of Britain’s large businesses have had an interesting few years, to say the least. As far back as the Brexit referendum campaign, they have been in the grip of a peculiar omertà, where nobody who wasn’t Deborah Meaden was allowed to take a view on the lack of virtues, from their point of view, of leaving the EU. They couldn’t give a view on Brexit before it (honourable mention, here, to Charlie “bollocks to Brexit” Mullins, from Pimlico Plumbers), in case they were seen to be interfering with democratic outcomes. They couldn’t give a view after it, since what if some of their shareholders voted to leave? They couldn’t give a view on the type or execution of Brexit, because the important thing was to stop debating it and get some clarity. They couldn’t give a view on the Conservative party, except to silently slip out of its donor circle – or were they squeezed out by the hedge fund managers who now dominate? They couldn’t even respond when the prime minister openly said “fuck business”, which is a genuine head-scratcher. You’ll recall, however, that this discretion was a one-way street: business leaders who leant towards leave were very open about doing so. There may not have been many of them – James Dyson, who later attempted to relocate his HQ to Singapore, and Wetherspoon’s boss Tim Martin, who suggested at the start of the pandemic that his bar staff could get a job in, ahem, Tesco – but they made enough noise. This resolute tact from the private sector contributed the two great cliches of current politics – first, that vocally opposing Brexit, and later, the mismanagement of public finances during the pandemic, is a rather childish pursuit, which grownups and wealth creators don’t do. Second – and this has an absolute cockroach-durability – that businesses prefer Conservative governments because they create more prosperity. Both have created a mirage of authority and maturity around Johnson and the leave project, which are objectively pretty delinquent. Political opposition has been left sounding isolated, hysterical and irritating – one lone, noisome car alarm surrounded by dogs that won’t bark. In fact, the windfall tax is nowhere near radical enough from Labour. It omits to point out why the fossil fuel industries are so dominant in the first place, or trace any line between the current crisis and David Cameron’s feckless abandonment of the “green crap” and his nonsensical moratorium on windfarms. As a stand-alone policy, it frames the problem as one of greedy companies rather than economic policies that give them that market power in the first place. It is, however, a valuable first step in an evolving project, one that at least correctly restores some power to government in its ability to intervene and help individuals overcome hardship. The Conservative response to the crisis – for brevity, “There’s not much we can do, have you tried a food bank?” – dissolves on contact with any practical idea. Labour shouldn’t be relying on trusted voices of commerce and political impartiality in order for its project to evolve. And it would be foolhardy to rely on members of the government taking notice; they have disregarded business interests with impunity, or even glee, for so long that it’s unlikely they’ll suddenly sit up and take them seriously. Yet that doesn’t make the moment any less seismic; it’s a gear-change in what constitutes corporate common sense, from resignation to recognising that perhaps there’s more than one game in town.

5/12/2022,"The BBC will double the number of half-hour comedy pilots it makes and invest an extra £10m in the genre in a bid to find the next Fleabag or Motherland. Sharing plans for the future of comedy at the corporation, the director of BBC Comedy, Jon Petrie, said his department was investing in its “development process”. “We want relatable British characters with an angle we’ve not seen before, and we want high joke rates,” Petrie said in a speech at the BBC Comedy festival in Newcastle on Wednesday. “We also want shows that talk to younger audiences.” The Bafta-winning producer behind Stath Lets Flats and People Just Do Nothing said the broadcaster was looking for shows that connected with its audience, “whether they’re big and broad or weird and provocative”. These audiences, he added, are drawn to worlds that they can see themselves in. “It’s no accident that it’s the family home and the workplace that have proved the most enduring settings for sitcoms,” he said. “Some of the most creatively brilliant and popular shows of the last couple of years, like Ghosts and Motherland, have that classic DNA in them but we get pitched comparatively few of those kinds of shows. So bring us more!” Motherland won the award for best scripted comedy at the TV Baftas last weekend. The London-set sitcom, co-written by Sharon Horgan and starring Anna Maxwell Martin, follows a group of parents and their everyday challenges at the school gates. “Motherland has now reached 25% of the population across its three series to date,” Petrie said. “Then there’s the runaway success, Ghosts, which shows the evergreen quality of comedy, as audiences continue to seek it out on iPlayer. The first episode of series one has been watched by 11.5 million to date. “But it’s not just viewing figures. iPlayer is full of critical successes like Inside No. 9, In My Skin and Alma’s Not Normal. Authored pieces that empower talent to tell stories they care about and shows I am incredibly proud to inherit.” Over half of all BBC comedy viewing now comes from iPlayer directly. Last year, iPlayer broadcast over 6bn requests with 538m of those for comedy shows. Petrie said the new pilots “will be better funded, and they will all be non-TX. We want to show much less of our homework, allowing time and space to fail and for our new series to arrive as fully formed as possible.” It comes as the BBC announced a host of new comedy programming, including the return of hit sitcom Bad Education, which will see Jack Whitehall reprise his role as teacher Alfie Wickers. The show, which ran from 2012 to 2014, will be rebooted as a six-part series for its 10th anniversary. Whitehall said he is “so pumped” to return to the “show that launched my career”. The Bafta-winning comedy Detectorists will also return after a five-year break for a 75-minute special, while actor and comedian Mawaan Rizwan has had a comedy, Juice, commissioned for a six-part series after a successful pilot episode. Jack Carroll and Tom Gregory have written a new comedy short for BBC Three titled Mobility, and popular comedy shows Jerk, The Cleaner and Guilt have all been given further series.

5/12/2022,"The fate of the vast quantities of oil and gas lodged under the shale, mud and sandstone of American drilling fields will in large part determine whether the world retains a liveable climate. And the US, the world’s largest extractor of oil, is poised to unleash these fossil fuels in spectacular volumes. Planned drilling projects across US land and waters will release 140bn metric tons of planet-heating gases if fully realised, an analysis shared with the Guardian has found. The study, to be published in the Energy Policy journal this month, found emissions from these oil and gas “carbon bomb” projects were four times larger than all of the planet-heating gases expelled globally each year, placing the world on track for disastrous climate change. The plans include conventional drilling and fracking spanning the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico to the foothills of the Front Range in Colorado and the mountainous Appalachian region. But the heart is the Permian basin, a geological formation 250 miles wide that sits under the mostly flat terrain of west Texas and New Mexico. One lobe of this formation, known as the Delaware basin, is predicted to emit 27.8bn metric tons of carbon during the lifetime of planned drilling, while another, known as the Midland basin, will potentially unleash 16.6bn tons of emissions. It means the US, the centre of the world’s addiction to oil and gas, will play an outsized role in the heatwaves, droughts and floods that will impact people around the planet. “The Permian is where a lot of the shale upstream investment will go and companies are getting better and better at extracting oil from there,” said Sam Ori, the executive director of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago. “In an environment where it is profitable and where there is a market for oil, it is hard to think there won’t be drilling there for decades to come.” Extracting oil and gas through unconventional methods such as fracking has expanded rapidly across the US over the past two decades, with at least 17.6 million people living within about half a mile (1km) of an active well. Further expansion will be catastrophic for climate change, and poses a growing threat to the health and wellbeing of families and communities living near drilling sites. Colorado is the country’s fifth-largest oil producer, with 90% coming from just one county: Weld, where the lack of federal regulation has led to the rapid spread of fracking wells in residential areas close to homes, schools, hospitals, and shopping malls. “Wells are like trees here, it’s normal to see one on every block. We’re surrounded by them,” said Raquel Venegas, 34, a paralegal whose children attend Bella Romero school, where 11 fracking wells operate 210 metres (686ft) from the playground. Compared with traditional drilling, fracking is linked to higher levels of exposure to toxic air pollutants and poor water quality, as well as unhealthy noise and light pollution. Numerous studies have suggested elevated rates of congenital heart defects, childhood leukaemia, asthma, and premature births in neigbourhoods close to fracking sites, while elderly people living near or downwind are more likely to die prematurely. Yet tens of thousands of oilwells, dredging up more than a third of US oil production, dot the Permian basin and production is about to escalate. Exxon has said it will boost production from the Permian by 100,000 barrels a day this year, while Chevron is upping its output by 60,000 barrels. The productivity of new wells in the Permian is expected to hit a record high in 2022, with next year forecast to be a landmark for the US as a whole – a record 12.6m barrels of crude oil pumped each day across the country. In March, a record 904 drilling permits were issued for companies operating in the Permian basin, according to the consultancy Rystad Energy. Typically, about 400-500 permits are approved each month but elevated oil prices and strong demand have caused an “unprecedented” and “extreme” increase, Rystad says. “The Permian is one of the hottest hotspots in the world for energy production – and it’s only going to grow,” said Michael Webber, an energy policy expert at the University of Texas. Colorado, a western state with a dramatic landscape of mountains, forests and canyons, is the seventh-largest gas-producing state. In 2019, it accounted for almost two-fifths of the country’s coalbed methane production. Oil and gas have been extracted for more than a century from the Denver-Julesburg basin, which underlies the state’s largest population hubs on the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains. However, production has risen exponentially over the past two decades thanks to the fracking boom. In recent years, Colorado has been hit by wildfires and floods linked to global heating, and the decline in snowpack on the mountains is fuelling drought and water shortages across the west. It also has some of the worst air quality in the country, with emissions from oil and gas operations accounting for 30-40% of locally produced ozone along the Front Range – the eastern plains of the Rockies, where most of the state’s 52,000 active wells (three-quarters are fracking sites) are located. A couple of years ago, elevated levels of the carcinogen benzene were detected at Bella Romero school, which is attended by mostly Black and Brown children from low-income households who often experience nosebleeds, irritated eyes and respiratory symptoms. Venegas said: “I worry about dying from climate disasters like fires and floods and get anxiety attacks if I think about what the wells are doing to my kids, it’s too scary.” Around the most heavily drilled areas, the fear and anxiety about the unknown dangers coupled with a sense of impotence have led to high levels of stress and reported mental health problems including depression. “The uncertainty and powerlessness people feel has a corrosive impact,” said Stephanie Malin, an associate professor of sociology at Colorado State University. “Plans to continue with fossil fuel extraction hangs on the industry’s pivot from climate denialism to the individual responsibility narrative that makes people feel hopeless and disempowered.” A doctors’ group revealed this year how the industry had hidden the use of PFAS – a class of toxins also known as forever chemicals – in more than 12,000 wells by claiming them as trade secrets. After years of campaigning by grassroots activists, regulations have gradually been tightened, and in March the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission made history by denying its first permit – temporarily halting the state’s largest producer’s proposal to build 33 wells close to 62 homes. New legislation, which changed state regulators’ mission from promoting oil and gas development to protecting public health, safety, welfare and the environment, stipulates that wells must be set back 2,000ft from property lines. Nevertheless, the company has been invited to reapply as exceptions can be granted, which campaigners argue weakens the legislation. “It’s been like the wild west. There’s so much money behind the industry, it’s impossible to win,” said Therese Gilbert, a middle-school teacher and activist who says she was frequently harassed during her eight-year crusade for better regulation. Now she fears another boom. “[The Russian war in Ukraine] is going to set climate change initiatives back under the cloak of patriotism when weaning ourselves off oil dictatorships and pivoting to renewables would be the patriotic choice,” she said. The state’s much maligned roadmap to reduce greenhouse gas emissions allows for oil and gas drilling to increase substantially by 2030. And there are signs the state’s ties to oil and gas will continue long into the future: the Wattenberg field in Weld is the fourth-largest US oilfield and ninth-largest gas field based on proved reserves. There are about 3,000 unused fracking permits and operators keep applying – and getting – more, as evolving technology allows companies to access shale oil and gas that were previously inaccessible, according to Kate Christensen from the nonprofit 350 Colorado. Retirees David and Dee Runcorn* moved to a brand new neighbourhood in Larimer county last year to be closer to their grandchildren and “live in harmony with natural wildlife”, as promised by the developer. The couple, who chose this oasis after checking there were no wells nearby, enjoy a landscape view of the Rocky Mountains as well as nature trails in lakes and shrubland. But the developer recently announced plans for 26 wells on two pads a couple of miles from the house. “It doesn’t make sense, this is a short-term fix. Oil and gas are limited resources, so if we want to be energy independent we have viable alternatives. It’s a no-brainer: we have to pivot to renewables,” David Runcorn said. Until then, more fracking means more misery for communities close to the state’s largest oil refinery, which processes almost 100,000 barrels a day in a noxious industrial corridor. In a Mexican neighbourhood close to the refinery, which has repeatedly violated pollution standards, the high school is one of the state’s worst performing. Lucy Molina, a resident and activist whose teenage daughter has debilitating migraines, blames the poor attendance and education outcomes on the noise, putrid smell, air and water pollution. “This is a sacrifice zone where you see how climate change is directly related to environmental racism. The industry and politicians bank on our misery, they would frack our asses and our souls if they could.” The Colorado Oil and Gas Association did not respond to repeated requests from the Guardian for comment. The US’s goliath output of oil is partly a consequence of the global oil shocks of the 1970s, when the country vowed to become more self-dependent for its fossil fuel supply. The US is now a net exporter of oil, although this production has come at a huge cost to the climate – not only from the oil burned but also the enormous amount of greenhouse gases vented directly by wells. The explosion in drilling in the Permian has even triggered a spate of earthquakes in Texas. Todd Staples, the president of the Texas Oil and Gas Association, said the intensity of methane emissions from the Permian basin had fallen even as production ramped up, and that oil from the region was extracted in a cleaner way than in other countries.“No one in the world produces the oil and natural gas needed to power modern life in a more environmentally responsible way than American oil and natural gas producers,” he said. “Now is the time for America to develop a forward-looking energy plan that recognises the importance of a strong domestic oil and natural gas industry that can provide the energy and security America and our allies need while advancing climate progress.” There is significant political pressure to increase domestic drilling in response to the Russia-Ukraine war, which has caused global oil prices to soar and the US to ban Russian oil imports. Large oil companies are considering an expansion in drilling should the high oil price linger. “We are wholly dependent upon oil and the crisis in Ukraine shows us that dependency is freighted with many costs, including national security,” Ori said. “We can’t drill our way out of this problem. It’s been a good reminder that we are the world’s top oil producer and that still has not insulated us from this crisis. “We have an oil-based system, so to change that we need to reduce the demand for oil. Europe is moving forward with targets on clean energy, and hopefully this crisis will give a big push to that in the US too.” *Names have been changed owing to fear of reprisals.",News/Environment,US fracking boom could tip world to edge of climate disaster,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/11/us-fracking-climate-fossil-fuel-gases
5/12/2022,"In between the pandemic lockdowns of 2020, Max Miechowski began travelling to the east of England to photograph the parts of the coast that due to natural erosion are, year by year, day by day, falling into the sea. From the series Land Loss (2020) More often than not he’d sleep in his car, parking as near to the cliffs as safely possible, getting up at sunrise. Images from the series Land Loss (2020-2021) “I’d be on the beach photographing the cliffs and quite often I’d see people come out from their houses, in their dressing gown with a cup of tea, and straight away go to the end of their land to see what damage had happened in the night,” he says. Miechowski, 32, who grew up in Lincoln and is now based in London, travelled from the Isle of Sheppey in Kent, where a landslide had recently caused a house to fall into the sea, through Hemsby in Norfolk to Yorkshire’s Spurn Point, a narrow peninsula that keeps disappearing; he then went further up the coast to Withernsea and Skipsea. Left: Dune Grass (2021). Right: Clifftop Flowers (2020) “Green Lane [in Skipsea] is particularly bad. A whole row of houses there is going to be gone in five to 10 years.” While cliff edges sometimes crumbled as he worked and the effects of heavy rainfall, shifting cliffs and sea erosion were all too visible, what he was eager to capture in the two-year body of work that has become Land Loss was not a dramatic documentary of damage, but the atmosphere of the place and the people who live here, out on the edge of England. Images include a portrait of two young sisters, whose grandparents had owned a cafe that fell into the sea, jumping together in a garden. Half Way House captures the surviving front of a former family home in Hemsby – “The owner cut it in half because otherwise the cliff would have taken the whole thing. He just wanted to keep the front door and have some reminder of it all.” In another picture a butterfly rests on the hand of Dave, a man who was given alternative accommodation when his house disappeared but can’t bear to live inland. From the series Land Loss (2020-2021) “He’s so used to the sea and that landscape,” says Miechowski. “He has put a caravan on the slither of land that’s left. When he dies he wants his ashes to be thrown from the cliffs into the sea.” From the series Land Loss (2020-2021) In this way Land Loss becomes a moving and evocative contemplation of the passing of time. Coastal Path (2021) “The entry point is the reality of the situation. It exists in a documentary way, in the sense that the erosion of the coast is a real story and it’s something happening, but the images and the interpretation of that situation are much looser, more philosophical.” Left: from the series Land Loss (2020). Right: Dovecote (2021) Miechowski, who was a musician before becoming a full-time photographer seven years ago, became interested in the idea during the making of A Big Fat Sky, his colourful and critically acclaimed project from 2019 about fading seaside resorts in the east of England. Land Loss is perhaps even more melancholic. From the series Land Loss (2020) “There’s beauty in [the landscape] but also sadness. You’re watching time fall away,” he says. “That was what was so interesting to me about the people who lived there, this immediate connection to that fact. Living in the city your reference to time tends to be all about exponential growth, whereas on the coast everything is disappearing – the reference point is the opposite. So the work became about this idea of being like a moth to a flame, being drawn into this landscape and almost falling off the edge yourself.” Left: Sunrise (2020). Right: Butterfly (2020) The people he photographed and met during the project cope with the reality of the disappearing land in varying ways. “It’s obviously stressful, but a couple of them would joke, having seen the neighbours house fall: ‘Well, we’ve got the sea-view now.’ And it’s funny because it’s like: ‘Well, you do for a bit …’ “Others are very frustrated. They want sea-defences to be put in, for the coastline to be protected, for it to be stopped. Which I totally understand, but it’s interesting: on paper it says you own this piece of a cliff, but if the sea comes and takes it away that signature or mortgage means nothing. You don’t own that land; it’s a construct. In that space, it’s futile.” Miechowski’s work, which he shoots on a Japanese medium-format analogue camera from the 1980s, has become synonymous with his magical handling of natural light, as well as the empathy with which he portrays his subjects. Both taken in 2020, from the series Land Loss “I have quite a romantic perspective on things, and that dreamy backlight – working early in the day or late in the morning – speaks to that,” he says. “It creates softer tones, softer shadows, richer colour; it can be kinder for portraits. It brings a warmth that is totally in line with my vision and the subject matter that gets me there in the first place.” Left: Safety Pin (2021).

5/12/2022,"The Church of England is to pump £3.6bn into its 12,500 parishes over the next nine years in an effort to halt its decline by increasing “mission activity” among young people and disadvantaged communities. The money – a 30% increase in funding from the church commissioners, who look after the C of E’s central assets – will support social action projects such as food banks, and help the church achieve its target to be carbon net zero by 2030. The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, and the archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, admitted the C of E had been heavy-handed in concentrating funds on urban churches in recent years. “Allocating money in the past was perhaps, if we’re honest, a bit too driven from the centre. Now we’re trusting the dioceses much more,” said Cottrell. Rural parishes have complained that they have been starved of cash, which has been diverted to inner-city churches. As a result, churches have closed and clergy jobs have been lost, according to a campaign group, Save the Parish. Welby said: “Over the last few years, the priority has been very much for the more heavily populated areas. Having listened carefully to what people were saying, this [funding] is for everyone, including the rural areas.” The core of the extra funding will be used for programmes that focus on young and disadvantaged people, deliver social action work, address racism and cut the church’s carbon footprint. It will support churches in the poorest areas of the country and fund more clergy in frontline ministries, including chaplaincies. “This funding will help the C of E raise its game in its service to the nation,” said Cottrell. The archbishops announced the funding increase from St John the Evangelist church in Balby, Doncaster, which runs a “multibank”, providing food, clothing and essential items for people in need, and a free coffee shop and drop-in centre. Cottrell said: “It gives me no joy in saying the Church of England has been in decline for a while. I’m not going to get depressed about that … What I’m going to do is focus on how we can best live and share the gospel.” The C of E could learn from the Balby church and others like it, which had been revitalised by social outreach work, he added. Welby pledged that the church would “speak out” about the cost of living crisis. “People in really quite good jobs, not minimum wage jobs, [are] finding that they just can’t make ends meet,” he said. The national funding from the church commissioners accounts for only 20% of overall costs, with the biggest share coming from churchgoers’ donations. The increase in the national grant has been made possible by returns of 13.3% on the commissioners’ investments last year, according to financial results for 2021 published on Wednesday. The commissioners increased their stake in Alibaba as the Chinese e-commerce giant became embroiled last year in a sexual assault scandal that led to a police investigation. It is the first time that Alibaba has appeared in the commissioners’ list of top 20 shareholdings since reports were first published online in 2013. It puts the company among the commissioners’ largest equity holdings, which last year included Amazon, the Google owner Alphabet, the Facebook parent company Meta, Visa and Microsoft. Reports emerged in December that Alibaba had fired the female employee who last summer accused her manager and a client of sexual assault during a work trip to the city of Jinan in Shandong province. Alibaba had previously said that it had suspended “relevant parties” for violating its rules and that it had a “zero-tolerance policy against sexual misconduct”. A spokesperson for the church commissioners declined to comment on specific investments, but said they had a “controversies policy” that assessed companies quarterly. “We always retain the right to restrict companies on an ad hoc basis if their activities fall foul of our ethical investment policies,” the spokesperson said.",News/World news,Church of England to pump £3.6bn into parishes and fund more social action ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/church-of-england-to-pump-36bn-into-parishes-and-fund-more-social-action
