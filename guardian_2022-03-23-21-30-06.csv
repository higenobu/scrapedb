3/23/2022,"Attempting to combine absurdist farce, genuine tragedy and an ocean of research, Edward Einhorn’s sweet but unsatisfying play imagines a Jewish wedding for the famous modernist couple Gertrude Stein and Alice B Toklas. With the dialogue looping and careening akin to the way that Stein wrote, Einhorn’s play purports to be about these two remarkable women and the love between them, but the script is far more preoccupied by the idiosyncrasies of the famous men cavorting around the pair. In 1933, Stein published The Autobiography of Alice B Toklas, about and supposedly by the love of her life. Here, Einhorn toys with authorial voice, with Stein as our narrator. She addresses us directly, Natasha Byrne playing the writer with a stern certainty, introducing each scene and the characters that our four-strong cast are pretending to be in that moment. As they roll through the greats of modernism attending their fantasy wedding – Ernest Hemingway, Pablo Picasso, James Joyce, Alfred North Whitehead, all well-performed but shallow caricatures – the show quickly takes on the guise of an amateur improv skit. Alyssa Simon plays Toklas, gentler than Stein but with a wry wit. As she sits reluctantly alongside the other wives of geniuses, the pseudointellectual conversations between their partners grow tedious, with the play seemingly overwhelmed by the need to include every argument modernists ever had with one another. The research put into their discussions is obvious, but the comedy here is lacking. Without being woven into a story, these scenes feel like we’ve stumbled into philosophy class without being warned to do the homework. The motif of pretending is a weighty one, particularly with the connotations of falsehood attached to queer relationships. But it is only at the very end of the play that the idea is used to piece together the disparate parts of the text. Alice’s moving final monologue, revealing what the couple lost by not being officially wedded, provides a stronger sense of their relationship, and a far heftier emotional kick, than the entire preceding script. Much of the play is spent in search of understanding what makes a genius. Far more powerful are the moments when that quest is ignored, and focus is instead directed towards the specifics: of the love between these two women and of the imagined wedding they were not allowed to have.

3/23/2022,"Ministers have not yet made a final decision about whether to include a renewed push for onshore wind in next week’s energy independence plan, with some in cabinet sceptical about the move, government sources say. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has made clear publicly that he would like to see planning rules relaxed, in order to facilitate the building of more onshore wind farms, and Michael Gove, who oversees the planning system, has also spoken out in favour. However, one cabinet minister told the Guardian there shouldn’t be a rush to onshore wind because it’s “not cost effective” and “extremely expensive”. Some are understood to prefer a push for fracking, despite safety and environmental concerns. The energy independence plan was announced by the prime minister in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Set to be published next week, it is expected to signal a rapid expansion of nuclear power and accelerated targets for renewables – but it is unclear whether a relaxation of planning rules around onshore wind will be included. A Downing Street source insisted “all options have to be on the table, given global price increases and the need to be self-sufficient – but nothing is decided yet”. David Cameron’s government tightened planning rules for onshore wind developments in 2014, requiring more local consultation. Sparked by grassroots Tory opposition from communities which saw the turbines as an eyesore, the move has effectively acted as a moratorium. Eight members of Boris Johnson’s cabinet – Jacob Rees-Mogg, Steve Barclay, Brandon Lewis, Nadine Dorries, Nadhim Zahawi and Mark Spencer – were signatories to a 2012 letter opposing onshore wind, though a No 10 source insisted, “I wouldn’t read too much into that”. At the time, the communities secretary, Eric Pickles, said, “we need to ensure that protecting the local environment is properly considered alongside the broader issues of protecting the global environment.” Kwarteng has suggested the public’s opposition to wind farms has fallen away, given the push for net zero, and the renewed interest in energy self-sufficiency since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “There were quite understandable political reasons that people didn’t want to see large-scale, onshore winds in their vicinity. I think that’s changed,” he told the i earlier this week. “I think the prime minister has been very clear that onshore wind has got to be part of the mix and we’ve got to look at planning.” He added: “the argument about onshore wind in 2015 was a historic argument even before we committed to net-zero and the circumstances today with Putin. Russia, Saudi Arabia, all of those things mean that we’ve got to have more energy independence and I think onshore renewables are absolutely part of that.” Asked if the prime minister agreed with Kwarteng’s view, Johnson’s official spokesman said on Tuesday: “I think the public has recognised the need to diversify our energy supply, and the importance of having sustainable energy sources, which move away from the volatility we see from non-renewables.” Scotland has pushed ahead with onshore wind, with a more liberalised planning system, and is regarded in Whitehall as what one government source described as a “major success story”. The UK has announced that it is seeking to phase out imports of Russian oil by the end of 2022, and will also examine ending Russian gas imports. Boris Johnson was himself previously a sceptic about wind farms, writing in 2013 that they couldn’t “pull the skin off a rice pudding”. The shadow environment secretary, Ed Miliband, has argued that a “sprint” towards renewables, not investment in fracking, should be the government’s response to the crisis in Ukraine.",News/Environment,Cabinet undecided over onshore wind ahead of UK energy plan,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/23/cabinet-undecided-over-onshore-wind-ahead-of-uk-energy-plan
3/23/2022,"Gardeners and homeowners should swap their fence for a hedge, the Royal Horticultural Society is urging as it begins a study into which species are best for tackling the climate crisis and pollution. Scientists at the charity are looking into green infrastructure, particularly in urban areas. One example of such infrastructure is using hedges to mark boundaries between properties and gardens. A team led by the RHS’s principal horticultural scientist, Dr Tijana Blanusa, will investigate the properties of different types of hedge, looking into how they provide important ecosystem services and assessing the benefits of mixed hedging. Hedges can reduce pollution and improve air quality; slow the flow of rainwater which can help with flood management; provide shelter for wildlife; and help regulate temperature through shading and cooling. Blanusa said: “The humble hedge is often the hero feature in any garden. Acting as a natural screen, they not only provide important environmental services but are relatively cheap, long lasting and have only a small ground footprint. “Knowing which planting combinations to choose to get the most environmental benefit, and how to look after them effectively, could enable wider uptake as we seek to future-proof our towns and cities.” Current research suggests beech, privet and holly plants have the best all-round effects. The charity will study how different species provide their benefits. They will be looking at factors including leaf shape, texture and branch structure, which are all thought to make them more adept at various roles. Many areas have a monoculture of hedges, meaning that just one species is planted, perhaps for aesthetic purposes. While this is a traditional way to plant in a garden or urban area, scientists fear it can leave plants susceptible to disease and limit biodiversity. Blanusa’s two-year project will look into the best combinations of hedges for year-round benefits to urban areas. She will study plants in a laboratory setting but also in a real-life application at a school. She will be trialling six combinations of mixed hedging, using four plants: privet, western red cedar, hawthorn and elaeagnus.",News/Environment,"Swap your fence for a hedge, says RHS as it begins climate study",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/23/swap-fence-for-hedge-rhs-climate-study
3/23/2022,"These deliciously pillowy little dumplings are found all over Italy in a variety of forms – the pasta-like Sardinian malloreddus, the semolina-based gnocchi alla romana and the ricotta clouds of Tuscan gnudi, to name but a few – but it’s the fluffy potato version of the north that has achieved the greatest fame abroad, and they’re surprisingly simple to make. Prep 5 minCook 1 hr 40 minServes 6 1kg large desiree potatoes, or other medium-sized potatoes, all roughly the same size350g plain flour½ tsp fine salt1 pinch nutmeg (optional)2 small eggs, beaten Though better chefs than me favour a floury potato for their gnocchi, I always get the best results from a potato with a medium starch content, such as desiree or maris piper. Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Meanwhile, wash the potatoes, dry them well and prick each one a few times, so they don’t explode in the oven. Ideally, the potatoes should be elevated above the baking tray so they don’t develop too hard a skin; if possible, put them on a rack or cover the base of the tray with rock salt. Bake for about an hour, until completely cooked through: the timing will depend on the size of the potatoes, so check them regularly towards the end. As soon as they’re cool enough to handle, peel off the skins and discard them: though I’m not counselling burning yourself in the service of supper, the more you let the potatoes cool before making the gnocchi, the chewier the finished results will be, so it pays to get in there as soon as it’s safe to do so. Whisk 250g of the flour with a half-teaspoon of fine salt and a pinch of nutmeg, if using. Tip on to a clean surface. Working from roughly elbow height, push the potatoes through a ricer (or a fine sieve) on to the flour. Make a well in the middle. Pour the beaten eggs into the well, then mix everything with your hands until it comes together into a soft dough; add more flour, if necessary, but stop mixing the moment it comes together; again, too much flour will make your gnocchi tough. Gather up the dough and set aside while you clean the work surface and dust it with a little more flour. Put the dough back in the centre of the work surface and flatten it into a roughly 1½cm-thick square. Cut this into 1½cm-wide strips, then, working one at a time, roll the strips into long sausages. Line up all the sausages together, then cut them all into 1cm-wide segments. Dust the gnocchi lightly with flour, then roll each one over the back of a fork, pressing your thumb into the dough as you do so, so it gets grooves on one side and a little indentation on the other (videos online may help). You can at this point put them on a floured tray, cover and refrigerate until ready to use. Bring a large pan of salted water to a boil, then turn down to a simmer and tip in half the gnocchi. Stir, then wait for them to rise to the surface. Count slowly to 10, then remove with a slotted spoon and keep warm while you cook the rest. Toss with your chosen sauce and serve. Gnocchi are great with a meaty ragu, or a tomato sauce, but my favourite way to eat them is with butter and sage. Melt 200g butter in a wide pan over a medium heat. Once it foams, add a small handful of fresh sage leaves, season and continue cooking until the butter is brown and nutty. Take off the heat, toss with the gnocchi and serve hot.

3/23/2022,"Jean Cocteau’s 1930 play is a monologue disguised as a series of break-up phone calls in which we hear the anguish of a woman being left by her partner. Using the telephone as a metaphor – the cut or crossed lines a mirror to the couple’s emotional disconnect – it is not just a dramatic experiment in voice but a painfully human play about being desperately, frantically, in love with someone as they coolly walk away. There have been vastly different versions of the central, tormented character, from Ingrid Bergman’s tremulous chain-smoker in 1960 to Tilda Swinton’s imperiously wounded woman in Pedro Almodóvar’s 2021 film. What is key is the grip of the emotional drama. That drama is not captured here, nor its tension. The director Ivo van Hove also adapts Cocteau’s script and manages to divest it of its raw emotional power and momentum. It becomes as stripped and sterile as the empty glass box of a set, designed by Jan Versweyveld, which seems to keep us at arm’s length with its clinical inscrutability. Ruth Wilson, as a spurned lover dressed in tracksuit bottoms and a Tweety Pie top, variously underplays and over-eggs her character’s suffering. There are cringing moments of overt theatricality when she imitates the couple’s dog, hugs her lover’s shoes and mimes frenzy, sometimes with added dance moves, in musical interludes featuring Beyoncé and Radiohead. There is one painfully passive moment when she is pinned to the wall, her back to us, while we listen to Radiohead’s How to Disappear Completely, from beginning to end, which not only brings tedium but also gives the dehumanised impression of a dead insect caught on fly-paper. Wilson seems to skirt over lines that represent her character’s powerlessness (she feels guilty and refuses to blame her partner for the hurt he has caused her). These segments, however difficult for a modern audience, are nakedly honest and courageous in their vulnerability but do not sound or feel so here. Perhaps Wilson is trying to infuse strength into the part but it ends up sounding artificial and distancing. As she unravels, there are hints of psychosis – is her lover merely a voice in her head? – but this interesting development is not sustained. Cocteau said he wrote this play after his stable of female actors complained that their parts were too writer-director dominated. Ironically, this seems to be just the problem with this stylised production; Wilson’s character is part of a grander directorial vision. The glass casing, which turns out to be a view into Wilson’s home from her balcony, might have created a voyeuristic intimacy, as was the case in a smaller, far more effective production at London’s Gate, starring Leanne Best, in 2018. But Wilson only ever looks like an exhibit encased in glass, dramatising female pain rather than inhabiting it. A script traditionally staged as phone calls here morphs into a dramatic monologue, which is an innovative move but the play interrupts its own reconceptualisation by returning to the dramatic device of the phone call towards the end. Most troublingly, there is a whiff of the old cliche around women’s suicidal heartbreak which dooms this character to an Anna Karenina fatalism. Here, though, we see this depressed, despairing woman putting on her heels and a killer dress in one suicidal moment – looking not unlike a model from an expensive perfume advert – which verges on misogynistic fantasy. And for all its theatricality, the play remains stolidly sedate; a 65-minute monologue that creeps to its end.

3/23/2022,"The final version of the UK’s online safety bill, which was presented before parliament last week is likely to face a fair few amendments as it passes through the legislative process. But the legislative draft gives us our first real look beyond the government’s spin at what aspects of UK law are about to change. The bill places a duty of care on tech firms to protect users from harmful content. That duty of care is broadly split into three parts: to limit the spread of illegal content such as child sexual abuse images, terrorist material and that encouraging suicide; ensuring children are not exposed to harmful or inappropriate content; and, for the big platforms like Facebook, Twitter and TikTok, protecting adults from legal but harmful content (such as cyberbullying and eating disorder-related material). The legislation will be overseen by Ofcom, the communications regulator, which will have the power to impose fines of £18m or 10% of a company’s global turnover for breaches of the act. In extreme cases, it can also block websites or apps. Here is a quick precis of the bill, which is expected to become law by the end of the year. Illegal content The bill applies to companies that host user-generated content (so that’s everything from tweets to gym sessions on YouTube) and it requires every organisation within its scope to have in place systems and processes that take down illegal content as soon as they see it. There is also a list of “priority” harms that must be tackled proactively so users don’t get to view them. Those harms include money laundering and human trafficking (alongside the terrorist and child sexual abuse content). The bill also applies to search engines like Google. Legal but harmful content This is the most controversial element of the bill. Removing “legal but harmful” – nasty but not criminal – content is a duty that applies to so-called “category 1” services, which are the big hitters like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and TikTok. The legal but harmful clause has alarmed civil liberties campaigners who warn that it will be a censors’ charter: content that resides in a grey area, like satire, could be subject to widespread takedowns. The bill requires that category 1 companies carry out risk assessments detailing the legal but harmful content that could appear on their services (abuse of footballers on Twitter; Russian disinformation on Facebook). They will then have to set out how they will deal with it in their terms and conditions, and state whether they intend to limit, remove or allow that sort of content. So, as a user, you know what you’re in for when you log on. But politicians are also going to have a say on what is unacceptable. These are the priority categories of legal but harmful content. Companies don’t get to decide if they can keep these up. These categories will be outlined in secondary legislation and subject to approval by both houses of parliament. In its press release announcing the bill, the government referred to “self-harm, harassment and eating disorders” as being the types of content that platforms will have to tackle. Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, says this will take away the power of censorship from tech execs (it just ends up with the government instead). Child protection The child-protecting elements of the bill have been talked up strongly by Dorries, underpinned by the duty of care. The measures include requiring pornography sites to carry out age checks, which privacy campaigners fear could create a database of the nation’s sexual habits, or even become a backdoor to digital ID system for accessing the internet. However, supporters of the measure argue that the impact of watching pornography on teenagers is such that action has to be taken. Companies will also be required to report to the National Crime Agency any child sexual exploitation and abuse content they detect on their platforms. But the reporting requirement goes further than many are comfortable with: the bill contains provisions that could be used to require companies to actively monitor private chats for such content. And those provisions contain no exception for messages, such as those on WhatsApp, that are “end-to-end encrypted”, meaning the platform cannot see their contents. Critics fear the rules could be an effective ban on the technology, ending a five-year battle from the government. Freedom of press and expression Under the terms of the bill, “news publisher” content has protections, as does “journalistic” content. News websites such as the Guardian, BBC and MailOnline are not covered by the bill (so do not have to follow its guidelines) while below-the-line comments are protected, as well as news content re-posted on social media platforms. The wording of the bill doesn’t give news content a free pass, however. For instance, the bill requires tech firms to “ensure that the importance of the free expression of content of democratic importance is taken into account” when making decisions about “how to treat such content (especially decisions about whether to take it down or restrict users’ access to it)”. The same wording is used for journalistic content and implies that content takedowns could still happen. The press release accompanying the bill appears to acknowledge concern among news publishers about the extent of these protections, stating that: “Ministers will also continue to consider how to ensure platforms do not remove content from recognised media outlets.” Dorries has said she intends to introduce amendments to the bill ensuring that news publisher and journalistic content cannot be taken down until an appeal against a removal decision has taken place. Criminal charges The government has reduced a grace period for UK-wide criminal measures against tech execs by 22 months to just two months (ie there was going to be two year wait, from the moment the bill became law, before the offences were introduced). Tech execs will face up to two years if: they hamper an Ofcom investigation by failing to provide information in an “accurate and timely manner”; tamper with information being sought by Ofcom; obstruct an Ofcom audit or inspection, or provide false information, or if they provide false information at an interview. Companies can also be prosecuted under the last three of those of offences. There are also additional criminal offences for users in England and Wales: cyberflashing (sending an unsolicited sexual image); sending or posting a message that conveys a threat of serious harm; sending a communication with the intent of causing psychological harm or serious emotional distress (this covers Twitter pile-ons); and deliberately sending a false message with the intention of causing harm (deliberately pushing harmful and ineffective Covid treatments).

3/23/2022,"Coventry council has voted to suspend the world’s first twin city relationship, pausing its 80-year connection with the Russian city of Volgograd over the country’s invasion of Ukraine. The council announced “with a heavy heart” it was suspending twinning links with Volgograd, formerly Stalingrad, and would explore the possibility of twinning with the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Coventry and Stalingrad forged links of solidarity after both were heavily bombed in the second world war. After the Battle of Stalingrad, 830 women in Coventry sent the city money and a tablecloth embroidered with their names and the words “Little help is better than big sympathy”, which is now displayed in the Volgograd Panorama Museum. This led to Coventry and Stalingrad becoming official sister cities in 1944, before many similar links were formed between cities across Europe to foster peace and reconciliation, and later to encourage trade and tourism. There are now thousands of twin city relationships across the world, including more than 2,000 in the UK. Labour-run Coventry city council had originally announced it would be keeping its twinning link with Vologograd in order to keep an open dialogue with the people of the city, rather than its council. “We believe that is the way to build peace and understanding,” the council deputy leader said in a statement. The bishop of Coventry, the Right Rev Dr Christopher Cocksworth, said: “I think we need to use that twinning relationship to bring to the attention of our Russian friends the seriousness of the current situation and our horror at what is happening.” The Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain said it was “disappointed” by the decision, and argued the relationship should be suspended, rather than scrapped completely, in order to “send a message” to the mayor of Volgograd. In a full council meeting on Tuesday, councillors voted unanimously to suspend links with the city “until such a time that they can resume”. Taiwo Owatemi, Labour MP for Coventry North West, said she welcomed the decision. “In recent weeks, I have been listening to and engaging with the Ukrainian community in our city” she said. “They have repeatedly told me that they believe suspending our twinning link with Volgograd is the right thing to do, sending a powerful symbolic message to both the Ukrainian people and the Putin regime. “I would like to thank Coventry city councillors for listening to our Ukrainian community and taking this important step to stand with Ukraine at this difficult time.” The move comes after a number of other cities, including Exeter, Plymouth and Cheltenham, suspended ties with their Russian sister cities in recent weeks following Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Coventry council stressed its commitment to continuing as the City of Peace and Reconciliation, an identity which emerged from its heavy bombardment during the blitz, and its twin city relationships with a number of war-torn cities including Hiroshima, Lidice, Caen, Belgrade and Sarajevo. Earlier this month, the organisers of the Coventry city of culture programme announced they would be postponing a joint arts project with the Russian city, titled the Volgograd digital tablecloth, which has been in production since 2019. It was to be a tapestry made from pictures donated by people living in both cities showing life through their eyes. “We have taken the decision to postpone the public sharing of the tablecloth. This is absolutely no reflection on those involved in the project, but we feel this is the right course of action for now,” organisers said in a statement.",News/UK news,Coventry no longer twinned with Volgograd in protest over Ukraine war,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/23/coventry-no-longer-twinned-with-volgograd-protest-ukraine-war
