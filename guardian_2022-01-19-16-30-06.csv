1/19/2022,"In the Wachowskis’ 1999 film The Matrix, the humdrum life of the central character Neo is revealed to be an illusion. His green-tinted reality is actually a digital simulation created by connecting human brains to a computer. When Neo swallows the red pill offered to him by Morpheus, his body is disconnected from the computer system and he is plunged into a new and frightening reality: for the first time he experiences the physical world. But as philosopher David Chalmers points out, how does Neo know that this new reality is not just another convincing simulation? Or, as the Professor Cornel West (who played Councillor West of Zion in The Matrix Reloaded) puts it: “It’s illusions all the way down.” This is the mind-boggling philosophical rabbit hole into which Chalmers invites his reader to dive headlong: is this – to paraphrase Bohemian Rhapsody – the real world, or is it just fantasy?  Although Chalmers’s interest in virtual reality as a philosophical problem began when he was asked to write an essay for the official website of The Matrix at the time of its release, he now disagrees with the film’s premise – namely, that the digital simulation from which the film takes its name is an illusion. “Neo’s world is perfectly real,” he writes. Over 544 pages, Chalmers argues that virtual reality (VR) is in fact “genuine reality”. Chalmers taught himself to write computer programs at the age of 10 and discovered his first virtual world in 1976, the text-based Colossal Cave Adventure. Today he regularly uses different VR systems: “I put on a headset, open an application, and suddenly I’m in a virtual world,” he writes. In VR he has assumed a female body, visited Mars, grappled with assassins, and taken to the skies like a bird. During the pandemic he regularly used it to discuss philosophy, meeting up with his “merry band of fellow philosophers”. Although the technology may still be somewhat clunky, he notes, “we had the sense of inhabiting a common world”. Facebook’s recent rebranding as Meta – short for “metaverse”, a term borrowed from Neal Stephenson’s 1992 novel Snow Crash – signalled the growing importance of these new immersive cyber technologies. Facebook’s Oculus Quest headset is already available and Apple is due to release one soon. Augmented reality (AR) is also improving, offering a way of experiencing the world that is part virtual and part physical, with digital objects or text overlaid across the visual field. Chalmers thinks AR could initially be more influential than VR, replacing screen-based computing entirely. As the technology progresses, AR glasses or contact lenses may be superseded by retinal or brain implants. A brain-computer interface would allow our eyes and other sense organs to be bypassed, affording access to a complete range of simulated sensual experiences. Ultimately, this will transform how we live, work and think: “My guess is that within a century we will have virtual realities that are indistinguishable from the nonvirtual world,” Chalmers predicts. He believes that eventually many people will spend most of their lives in these environments, just as today people choose to emigrate to another country: “Given all the ways in which virtual worlds may surpass the nonvirtual world,” he writes, “life in virtual worlds will often be the right life to choose.” Chalmers rejects the idea that digital experiences are always mere escapist fantasies, as they might be in video games: “Simulations are not illusions. Virtual worlds are real. Virtual objects are real.” They are clearly not the same as non-virtual objects, but a virtual chair is created using digital processes, just as a physical chair is made of atoms and quarks. It follows that what happens in virtual worlds really does happen. You could lead your entire life in one and find it meaningful and fulfilling. Indeed, Chalmers argues that we could already be inhabitants of a virtual reality: “We can never prove we’re not in a computer simulation because any evidence of ordinary reality could be simulated.” This is known as the simulation hypothesis, the scenario that is explored in the recently released Matrix Resurrections. Chalmers points out that humans have already invented games that simulate real life, such as The Sims. These will become more sophisticated over time, with versions of them running on millions of devices. Furthermore, out there in the rest of the universe, “if any aliens have human-level intelligence, they should eventually develop computers and program them. If these alien civilisations survive long enough, they’ll likely create simulated universes.” Statistically speaking, that means simulated beings probably already vastly outnumber “real” ones. In other words, it’s more likely we’re living in a simulation than in the original version of our world. If we are indeed living in a simulation, then the creator of it is our god, be that a mad scientist, an alien or a teenage girl who has pressed a button in SimUniverse and set us going. As an atheist, says Chalmers, “the simulation hypothesis has made me take the existence of a god more seriously than I ever had before”. Ultimately, Reality+ is about extending our sense of the real. Chalmers’s central idea, that “there is more to reality than we thought”, is seductive, and I was surprised to find his arguments delightfully – or perhaps worryingly – convincing. He has taken a subject most people would dismiss as pure science fiction and produced a brilliant and very readable philosophical investigation. The whole thing is an exercise in what Chalmers calls “technophilosophy” – asking philosophical questions about technology and using new technology to answer philosophical problems. He tackles some frankly mindbending ideas, but does so in a lively and entertaining style, filled with references to pop culture. The only question is whether you really want to know how deep the rabbit hole goes. But then, what do you have to lose but your illusions?

1/19/2022,"Nobody was talking much about Oscars when Spider-Man: No Way Home was released in cinemas last month, but it was easy enough to see that they soon would be. The film swung onto screens as a pre-ordained saviour of cinema, the hopes of an industry pinned on its well-worn spandex bodysuit. As soon as the film delivered the gargantuan box-office receipts that were fully expected of it, its handlers could go about requesting a non-financial reward for their efforts.  By the end of December, the film’s formal Oscar campaign for best picture had been launched, while a feature in trade outlet the Hollywood Reporter gave the producers a generous platform to insist on their worthiness. Marvel Studios’ president, Kevin Feige, made his case on populist grounds, stating his hope that the Academy “will think about the artistry that goes into storytelling that connects with a wide range of people on a very emotional level”, and adding that the public’s stand-and-cheer response to the film is “the sort of thing the Academy was founded, back in the day, to recognize”. Sony Pictures’ chair, Tom Rothman, meanwhile, argued for No Way Home as the model of “quality commerciality” that “the Academy needs to stay connected to”. His self-pitying clincher: “We have to overcome, weirdly, the prejudice against the fact that it’s a big hit.” Ah, the poor little rich film! No Way Home has, at this point, grossed over $1.6bn worldwide, but as this campaign would have it, what it’s missing is the love and respect of the industry that it’s saving. The shape of an Oscar behemoth has changed over the years: lately, voters have largely favoured independent and arthouse features that rake in modest sums relative to the average Marvel blockbuster’s total – as exemplified by last year’s win for Chloe Zhao’s quiet, meditative cross-country docufiction Nomadland, a film that shares a medium with Spider-Man in much the same sense that Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger shared DNA in Twins. (Meanwhile, Zhao’s own Marvel film Eternals, hailed by Feige prior to its release as a game-changing stunner, isn’t getting a whisper of awards talk from its studio: it only made a quarter of what No Way Home’s current gross, after all.) Lately, tumbling year-on-year TV ratings for the Oscar telecast have bolstered the narrative that Feige and Rothman are now pushing to their advantage: that the Oscars have lost their popular touch, spurning the public to align with the sensibilities of “elitist” critics and tastemakers. (Note that e-word, trickling down from the public-versus-media discourse of current conservative politics.) It’s the same complaint that, a few years ago, caused a desperate Academy to moot a “best popular film” Oscar, only to swiftly can the idea when it became clear they had no idea what the criteria for such a prize would be. (Most money or most respectable money? Who’s to say?) Building a best picture campaign on that same basis is both canny and disingenuous. The Academy has never had a prejudice against commercial success in itself, or indeed against the blockbuster form: in the last 10 years, supposedly the Oscars’ era of arthouse surrender, best picture nominations (and multiple prizes) have gone to such big, brash popular entertainments as Joker, Gravity, Get Out, Ford v Ferrari and Bohemian Rhapsody. No Way Home wouldn’t be the first Marvel Cinematic Universe adventure to land in the premier race: Black Panther netted Feige an Oscar nomination only three years ago. It wouldn’t even be the first sequel in a long-running action franchise to succeed where its predecessors failed: Mad Max: Fury Road scooped half a dozen Oscars in 2016. As it stands, No Way Home currently looks like an outside bet for a best picture nomination: a potential lower-ranking beneficiary of the Academy’s decision to permanently expand the best picture category to a fixed 10 slots, but hardly a frontrunner. Its awards hopes recently hit a speed bump when Bafta disqualified it in all categories after it failed to surface on the British Academy’s digital viewing platform in time. (British blockbuster hopes instead rest on No Time to Die, which featured prominently in Bafta’s longlists unveiled last week, though its likeliest Oscar shot is for Billie Eilish’s brooding theme song.) A rung down from the brand recognition of Spider-Man and James Bond, blockbuster cinema is all but assured a place in the Oscar race in the form of Denis Villeneuve’s gorgeous sci-fi spectacular Dune, which has hit all the required precursors thus far on the awards trail, and has made nearly $400m worldwide. That’s small change compared to No Way Home, certainly, but handily more than any best picture winner since The King’s Speech. (Tom Hooper’s royalty-corn drama may only be 11 years old, but it’s a distant-seeming artefact of an era when a small-scale, adult-skewing drama could make even moderate superhero numbers in cinemas.) Is Dune not an example of “quality commerciality”, in Rothman’s words? Or is it a billion dollars shy of that status? Is the Academy only prejudiced against big hits of a certain bigness? The more nebulous truth that Spider-Man’s campaigners don’t want to articulate, perhaps, is that it doesn’t feel like an Oscar contender in the way that most blockbusters crossing the best picture threshold do. Dune, by virtue of its genre alone, would be relatively outré as a best picture winner, but it is solemn, literary and visually and sonically lustrous. Villeneuve has conceived it as art even as it has to function as product, in much the same way that Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy, Oscar-garlanded despite landing outside the Academy’s genre wheelhouse, did 20 years ago. Even Black Panther, the closest precedent for a No Way Home nomination, made its case to the Academy on the basis of political resonance and innovative design: it was rewarded as a cultural milestone, not merely a pop phenomenon. No Way Home, by contrast, has a harder time presenting itself to Academy voters as anything but a commercial flashlight in Covid-era industry darkness. Novelty was never likely to be a virtue of the ninth Spider-Man film in 20 years, but little about the storytelling or formal construction of No Way Home rises above business-as-usual proficiency: even the multiverse twist that serves as its most distinctive narrative feature was more freshly and inventively treated in 2018’s Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. That film won a deserved Oscar in the animated category, but didn’t get a peep of best picture buzz. It’s noticeable that No Way Home’s Oscar campaign is laser-focused on best picture, with minimal effort made to big up its performances, direction, script or even the technical components that will inevitably lose to Dune across the board. As such, the campaign is promoting the film as bigger than the sum of its parts, with money making up the deficit. Perhaps, for some invested parties in an anxious industry, that’s enough. It wouldn’t be the first time. In the 1952 race, the Academy horrified some onlookers by handing best picture to Cecil B DeMille’s big, gaudy, extravagantly dumb and highly lucrative circus melodrama The Greatest Show on Earth, over future-classic western High Noon and John Ford’s The Quiet Man. That DeMille’s film won only one other prize (for “best original story”, a dubious claim) was telling. Nobody could say with a straight face that art had been served by the decision, but the year’s highest-grossing film by a wide margin had been acknowledged. It was, surely not coincidentally, the first Oscar broadcast ever to be televised: an ironic concession to a medium at that point seen as an ominous threat to cinema’s future. With the public watching, the Academy chose to celebrate the people’s choice – which just happened to be the kind of grand Technicolor spectacle that TV then couldn’t provide. It was neither the first nor the last time that the Academy bowed down to a popular phenomenon, though voters have tended to gravitate toward blockbusters that at least notionally match their ideas of prestige fare: sweeping historical romance in Gone With the Wind (or Titanic, decades later), anti-Nazi politicking in The Sound of Music, the morally burdened underworld saga of The Godfather films, the treacly American Dream ideology of Forrest Gump. Those blockbusters, however, don’t exist in a commercial landscape ruled by comic book fantasy, animation and all-important IP; gone, too, is the world where a modest, adult-targeted and borderline televisual character drama like 1988’s best picture winner Rain Man could also be the year’s highest-grossing film. Even as recent outlying winners like Moonlight and Parasite have pointed to a surge of younger, more adventurous voters in their ranks, the Academy’s taste hasn’t radically changed over the years: a film like 2018’s best picture winner Green Book could well have won the prize at any point in the last half-century, though in previous decades, it might have made blockbuster money. (As it is, Peter Farrelly’s aggressively middlebrow race-relations fable racked up over $300m worldwide – hardly evidence of voters’ turn for the esoteric.) All of which is to say the Academy hasn’t turned away from blockbusters so much as blockbusters have turned away from them, while the nice grown-up dramas that have always been their sweet spot have now been rebranded as art films. You couldn’t ask for a more on-the-nose example of this paradigm shift than the limp commercial fate of Steven Spielberg’s much-vaunted West Side Story remake last month. The 1961 original cleaned up at the box office and swept the Oscars too; its successor is now seen as a niche critics’ pet, though its Oscar hopes remain high. Is there anything to be gained from the Oscars re-embracing blockbuster cinema on its current terms, beyond a boost to Kevin Feige’s ego? The telecast ratings might get a bump from a No Way Home nomination, of course, but too many pundits overestimate Zoomers’ interest in watching a three-hour prize-giving ceremony – with ads – where their favourite film of the year may or may not get a gong. (If it does, they’ll surely watch it on YouTube the next day, along with Billie Eilish’s performance.) If that’s the uncertain clout the Academy wants to chase, then they may as well grit their teeth and make No Way Home this year’s The Greatest Show on Earth – in its time, a different kind of victory flag for a commercially imperilled form, further validated with gold. But it’ll age about as well.",Arts/Film,Can a blockbuster still win big at the Oscars? ,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/19/spider-man-no-way-home-oscars-debate
1/19/2022,"Uh oh, it has happened. I have officially turned into that person. You know who I mean: the adult who seems oblivious to the fact that their screeching infant is not the most adorable thing to crawl the face of this Earth but an out-of-control noise machine. That person is the previously sensible and self-aware friend of yours who beams every time their perfect progeny farts or grunts, and acts like it is the cutest thing they have ever seen. “What happened to you?” I used to think, when I was childfree, and hung out with friends who had procreated. “How do you not realise that your child is sort of annoying? What did parenthood do to your brain?” I do not have the scientific answers to this but I can say that parenthood has undoubtedly done a number on my own brain. I have 100% been baby-pilled. My eight month old will be screeching like a banshee and, instead of finding it irritating, I will look at her perfect little face and my heart will melt. I find myself googling things such as: if my baby screams a lot at an unusually high decibel level, does it mean that they are gifted? (The jury is out on that but my kid is obviously brilliant).  As well as being the smartest child ever, she is also exceptionally adorable. Everyone says so. The only time I have wondered if they might be politely lying is when I recently looked back at pictures of her as a newborn and realised that she was actually kind of funny-looking because, let’s be honest, all newborns are funny-looking. They are hairy, wrinkly, little gremlins. I can see that now. Eight months ago, though, I was convinced she was nothing like other newborns; I was sure she was unusually perfect.

1/19/2022,"My mother recently died of cancer, just three weeks after her diagnosis. While she was in hospital and the local hospice, visitors were restricted due to Covid. Many of her friends therefore paid for credit to top up her pay-as-you-go (PAYG) mobile phone so that they could keep in touch. But she deteriorated so quickly that she was unable to use all the credit, and had £93.86 left on the phone when she passed away. I asked the provider, Three, to refund the money so it could be donated to one of the four charities she had nominated in her final days. It was five weeks before the company told me that the money couldn’t be returned and that the number would have to be cancelled as it was in my mum’s name. Three has taken the money my mum’s friends so kindly gave her to ease her dying days and refused to allow me to pass it on to the hospice that looked after her so well.JC, London  Most mobile phone providers, believe it or not, hang on to unused mobile phone credits. Not only that – customers forfeit any outstanding money on their sim card and their phone number if they don’t use their phone for six months – or in the case of some providers, for just 70 days. This policy, buried in the small print, penalises often elderly customers who buy a PAYG phone for emergencies, and may find it doesn’t work when they suddenly need it. “Use it or lose it,” says telecoms regulator Ofcom on its website, while acknowledging that PAYG phones are suited to occasional users. A clause tucked down a firm’s terms and conditions may make it legal, but it doesn’t follow it’s ethical. Three’s terms and conditions make no provision for exceptional circumstances. When I asked the company how it justified retaining the credit, it decided it couldn’t. It refunded the £93 plus £57 in goodwill for your mum’s chosen charities. It also told you that it would review its policy in such situations. It says: “Our current policy is that top-ups are non-refundable. This includes top-up vouchers where a user has voluntarily paid this into their account to use at a later date. However, we appreciate that this is a sensitive circumstance.” Ofcom says: “Providers may have different policies when it comes to refunding unused PAYG credit, but all must have policies in place to make sure vulnerable customers are treated fairly. Anyone can face circumstances that lead to them becoming vulnerable – temporarily or permanently – including bereavement.” Three has now confirmed it is looking to change its bereavement policy in the light of your experience.Email your.problems@observer.co.uk.

1/19/2022,"Legal groups say the Victorian government should waive all fines issued under coronavirus public health orders following reports that some of those recruited to issue the fines were not properly authorised. The government separately promised 12 months ago to review fines issued under the Public Health and Wellbeing Act to ensure they passed the common sense test. That resulted in hundreds of fines being challenged in the magistrates court.  Community legal services have been calling for fines to be waived since 2020, arguing they disproportionately affected marginalised communities and had in some cases been issued to people who were acting in accordance with the law. Police in New South Wales have also been accused of issuing fines under that state’s public health legislation unfairly and incorrectly, with an alliance of legal centres calling for the fines to be withdrawn. Inner Melbourne Community Legal’s chief executive, Damian Stock, said the reported failure to correctly authorise fining officers strengthened the argument. “The various different arguments for why they should all be scrapped are really stacking up,” he said. “It would be a particularly unfair and heartless government to continue to pursue fines considering this litany of errors.” The Victorian government recruited the authorised officers in 2020 to enforce its public health orders, including issuing fines for breaching lockdown orders under the Public Health and Wellbeing Act. But the Herald Sun has reported that as many as 40 authorised officers were not properly gazetted and therefore did not have the power to issue fines. The Department of Justice and Community Safety said it was “currently reviewing our administrative processes relating to the appointment of a small number of authorised officers and the issuing of some enforcement outcomes”. “If the review were to identify any issues, the department would then work to confirm whether any enforcement outcomes are affected,” it said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service chief executive, Nerita Waight, said Victoria had issued more fines for breaching pandemic health orders than “almost any other jurisdiction globally” and those resources should have been directed to bolstering the health system. “We had many clients who were unfairly issued Covid fines and we found the whole process to be opaque and frankly lacking,” Waight said. Waight said Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were issued Covid fines at a higher rate than the rest of the community. “This unfairness was exacerbated by the lack of an independent review process for Covid fines. Waiving fines issued by officers without the correct authorisation is the right thing to do, as the community shouldn’t have to suffer because of the government’s stuff up.” Waight said that the vast majority of public health fines seen by VALS had been “unreasonably issued” and she called for an amnesty on “all but the most serious breaches”. Victoria police has refused to release detailed demographic data about who was issued fines and is fighting a freedom of information request made by community legal centres seeking that data. At a minimum, there should be a moratorium on pursuing people over unpaid Covid fines, Stock said. “We can’t have people having charges, being taken to court, having sanctions put on their vehicle, all the things that can happen if you have unpaid fines. “That needs to stop right away – we cannot have enforcement action out on fines that may have been issued by people who were not authorised to issue them.”",News/Australia news,Victoria urged to waive all Covid fines after reports some officers not correctly authorised,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/19/victoria-urged-to-waive-all-covid-fines-after-reports-some-officers-not-correctly-authorised
1/19/2022,"Four alleged members of the Nigerian mafia have been arrested in southern Italy after a young sex trafficking survivor spoke out against them. The men, who were arrested in Palermo and Taranto in the early hours of Tuesday, allegedly belong to the feared Black Axe, a cult-like criminal gang that emerged in the 1970s at the University of Benin, according to police.  Investigators in Palermo who led the operation said the woman, who is also Nigerian, was forced into prostitution after taking part in an occult ritual bound up with traditional spiritual beliefs, known as juju, which bond victims to their traffickers and to any debts they will incur. “The suspects were charged with slavery, human trafficking, kidnapping and pandering [recruiting prostitutes],” the police said. The woman, whom investigators said was convinced by a Pentecostal cleric to report her captors to police, had been imprisoned, raped, blackmailed and forced into prostitution to pay a debt of about €15,000 (£12,500). Before she left Nigeria, like many other victims of sex trafficking, the woman had been made to undergo a traditional oath-taking ceremony involving complicated and frightening rituals often using the women’s blood, hair and clothing. Those carrying out the ritual, which has been found to have a profound psychological impact on victims, make it clear that failure to pay off those debts will result in terrible things happening to the woman and her family. The abuse of religious and cultural belief systems in Nigeria has proved a deadly and highly effective control mechanism for traffickers recruiting women destined for the sex trade in Europe. A hugely profitable and well-organised criminal industry has been operating between Italy and Nigeria for more than two decades but the UN’s International Organization for Migration says it has seen a rise in the number of potential sex-trafficking victims arriving in Italy by sea in the past few years, lured by the promise of work in the country. According to a Save the Children report last year Italy had 2,040 victims of sex trafficking – 716 of whom were registered in 2020 – with the majority of them Nigerian. Father Enzo Volpe, a priest in Palermo who has been helping Nigerian women for nine years, told the Guardian: “These women are terrified of the threats and the violence perpetrated by their captors. They fear not only for their lives but also for those of their families back in Nigeria.” “The problem,” said Volpe, “is that behind the slavery of these women there is a real mafia with members operating across the continent, who have total control over their victims.” Last year, Italian police arrested 30 people suspected of belonging to the Nigerian Black Axe mafia, which has been operating in many regions of the country, among them its suspected 35-year-old leader in Italy.

1/19/2022,"Good morning from me, Warren Murray. You’ve got mail, and so has the 1922 committee.  There is open talk among Conservative MPs of removing Boris Johnson as prime minister after he gave a disastrous interview claiming not to have lied over Downing Street parties. It is thought more likely than not there will be a confidence ballot: “Letters are coming from the left and from the right, from Brexiters and remainers,” said one MP, “because what is slowly dawning on people is that there’s not a policy issue; this is a mindset, a modus operandi and culture that needs changing.” Christian Wakeford, a 2019-intake MP, revealed he had submitted a no confidence letter on Tuesday; a day that gave us the “pork pie putsch” of MPs elected in 2019. They met in the office of Alicia Kearns – whose constituency contains Melton Mowbray – to discuss Johnson’s future as prime minister. Johnson has defended himself against claims from Dominic Cummings, his former aide, that he lied to parliament about believing a garden party in the first lockdown was a work event. “I can’t believe we would have gone ahead with an event that people said was against the rules … nobody warned me it was against the rules, I am categorical about that – I would have remembered that,” Johnson told Sky News. Cummings has claimed that two officials warned the prime minister. Plan B easing likely – In a difficult prime minister’s questions today, Boris Johnson is expected to try again to change the national conversation away from his party problems by announcing the end of Plan B Covid measures, instructing millions to return to workplaces across England and dropping the requirement of vaccine certificates to enter venues like nightclubs and sports stadiums. The cabinet will meet this morning on the subject. In Scotland, restrictions brought in before Christmas are to be lifted from next Monday, the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said. Meanwhile researchers have said more than two-thirds of the common side-effects people experience after a Covid jab can be attributed to the nocebo effect, an opposite version of the placebo effect, rather than the vaccine itself.

Begg seeks passport back – The former Guantánamo detainee Moazzam Begg is planning legal action against Priti Patel to try to restore his British passport, which was revoked eight years ago after two trips to Syria. A terror prosecution relating to Begg’s time in Syria collapsed in 2014, after which police said they accepted he was innocent. Begg was arrested in February 2002 in Pakistan and ended up in Guantánamo before being released without charge in 2005. He works with the Cage advocacy group which campaigns to help people caught up in the “war on terror”. Begg said his trips to Syria in 2012 and 2013 were part of his campaigning activity, and he was told by MI5 that he was free to travel there, but his passport was taken in December 2013 as he returned to the UK from a trip to South Africa. Meningitis resurgent – Meningitis B cases among students in England are rising sharply to exceed pre-pandemic levels, according to a report by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). Meningococcal group B bacteria are a serious cause of life-threatening infections including meningitis and sepsis that can cause brain damage, epilepsy, hearing loss, the loss of limbs, and death. Linda Glennie from the Meningitis Research Foundation said: “The data published by UKHSA has highlighted that students, particularly those living on campuses, have a higher risk of meningococcal disease than their peers … Meningitis progresses rapidly, so it’s critical to alert someone if ill, and to seek urgent medical advice.” Straws buried in field forever – A set of ancient gold and silver tubes dating to about 5,500 years ago and unearthed in North Caucasus in Russia could be the world’s oldest surviving drinking straws, experts have claimed. The tubes, each more than a metre in length with a narrow perforated tip, were found in an excavation near Maykop in the summer of 1897. The relics, now in the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, date to the fourth millennium BC, and were made of segments joined together. A team of experts in Russia said they were likely to be straws for drinking beer from a shared pot.

The Guardian leads with “Clamour to oust Johnson grows as Tory MPs plot confidence vote”. Emma Raducanu’s successful Australian Open debut grabs the picture slot. The Times has “Red wall Tory MPs team up to topple Boris Johnson”. The Mirror’s take is “Porkie pie plot to ditch PM” – the paper quotes one Tory as saying “His time has gone.” The Mail has “Exposed: The ‘Pork Pie’ plot to topple PM” but seems to offer the PM some support, saying Plan B Covid curbs are being axed and Britain is “basking in a post-Covid jobs miracle” yet “panicking Red Wall MPs are turning on the man who got them elected”. As you might expect the Express is more shrill: “What a sorry state! New MPs plot to oust PM” saying Johnson apologises “TEN times for partygate” but still faces a rebellion. The Telegraph also mentions the axing of Covid restrictions in its lead with “Plan B to be scrapped as PM faces plot from rebel MPs” alongside a picture of a downcast Johnson wearing a mask. The i newspaper plays it straight with “Tory plotters in talks to topple Boris Johnson”. The Metro has simply “Nobody told me”. The Sun is out of step with its peers: “Strictly dancer Nadiya Bychkova has split from her footballer fiance”. Johnson’s troubles find a smaller spot under the headline “Pork Pie plot to oust Bojo”.
