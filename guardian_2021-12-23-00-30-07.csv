12/23/2021,"Did you rush to the advent calendar as soon as you woke up today? The British Board of Film Classification advent calendar, that is, which has been running on Twitter throughout this month. We’ve already learned so much. There was the revelation that past examiners considered Ron Howard’s How the Grinch Stole Christmas to be “educational” (always a big deal for the BBFC, which values few things more highly than a teachable moment) and believed the star of Rumble Fish and Angel Heart to be one “M O’Rourke”. It was no surprise to discover that a scene of Santa Claus wielding candy-striped chain-sticks was originally snipped from the 1996 comedy Jingle All the Way. The martial arts weapon, also known as nunchaku, was the special bugbear of James Ferman, the board’s director at the time, who seemed convinced that it posed a threat to the country’s wellbeing. How quaint. The scene was restored when the film was submitted again four years later. Times and tastes change, after all. That happens to be the BBFC’s justification for recent adjustments made to the ratings of a crop of blockbusters. A certificate is fixed at the time of a movie’s release, and is only amended when that title is resubmitted. One festive example: the 1988 Bill Murray comedy Scrooged earned a 12-certificate (for “moderate language and soft drug use”) when it was last submitted for home entertainment purposes in 2012, whereas its cinema rating remains PG, since it hasn’t been reassessed since its original release.  Recent rereleases of films such as Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and Jaws have led the board to reconsider those titles in the light of what they vaguely call “changing attitudes”. In most cases, there has been a tightening of restrictions, though any parents who would have let their child watch The Empire Strikes Back when it was a U-certificate but draw the line now that it has been upgraded to a PG could be said to have too much time on their hands. Talking of hands, it is the loss of Luke Skywalker’s right one, severed by Darth Vader’s lightsaber, that earned that movie its PG rating. Raiders of the Lost Ark has its previous A-rating (the pre-1982 equivalent of the PG) swapped for a 12, not on account of abundant racial stereotyping but rather its gleeful violence: melty-faced Nazis are now a no-no. Sexual content is another concern. A BBFC examiner who passed the original Ghostbusters as a PG back in 1984 wrote at the time that “a lot of kids are going to be scared out of their pants, but they will love it”. Today it is a different sort of scare involving pants – namely a scene which suggests Dan Aykroyd’s character is receiving oral sex from a ghost – which has prompted examiners to raise the rating to a 12. There was always a risque edge to that film’s humour, but what plays weirdly now is the schoolboy tittering (menstruation – tee-hee!) or the demonising of the Environmental Protection Agency (those rotters!) The BBFC has explained that its adjustments are the result of consultation and outreach work, and it is an organisation keen to “hear from” and “listen to” audiences. This latest endeavour, though, serves as a reminder that an antiquated classification board desperate to prove its relevance in the age of streaming, social media and parental locks is likely to crave being heard as much as anyone else. Perhaps the feelings of its staff were hurt this year by the British horror movie Censor, set in the 1980s in the claustrophobic offices of a BBFC-esque classification body, where a prim examiner sanctimoniously insists that she does her job “to protect people”. With every new tweet, amendment and press release (such as last month’s announcement about new rules surrounding material that involves racist language), the BBFC is reminding us that it is still out there: “Yoo-hoo! Don’t forget about us! We still matter!” The public is always encouraged during the festive period to spare a thought for those who might be feeling isolated or overlooked, and the BBFC is no exception. Please do keep them in mind during the excitement of opening your new chain-sticks on Christmas Day, or when you’re rallying the family, young and old, to watch Robert Shaw get chomped in half by a shark.",Arts/Film,"This holiday season, spare a thought for the British Board of Film Classification | Ryan Gilbey",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/22/this-holiday-season-spare-a-thought-for-the-british-board-of-film-classification
12/23/2021,"The Environment Agency has launched an investigation into alleged illegal waste activities at a landfill in Staffordshire which has plagued residents with noxious fumes for months. People living next to Walleys Quarry landfill in Silverdale, Newcastle-under-Lyme, are facing ongoing misery from strong smells caused by high levels of hydrogen sulphide on the site.  The EA said it had launched a formal investigation into the landfill operators, Red Industries, after receiving new information in October. The company denies breaking any regulations. Campaigners hailed the news as an “early Christmas present” and a major milestone in their fight for better air quality, although many said they felt an investigation was long overdue. “All we want is the truth. But we won’t take the pressure off the EA yet because we actually need to see the results, we won’t just accept platitudes,” said Dr Mick Salt, a local resident and radiation physicist. Newcastle-under-Lyme MP Aaron Bell said: “I welcome this formal investigation and I would like to thank all the sources that have come forward over the past year. “This is just one step, and it is important for legal reasons not to prejudice or prejudge this investigation. However I know the community will welcome this development.” Campaigners were dealt a blow last week when the EA won an appeal over a high court case which found the regulator wasn’t doing enough to control the landfill emissions that were shortening the life expectancy of five-year-old Mathew Richards. Mathew’s mother, Rebecca Currie, said she was “heartbroken” by the ruling and vowed to take the case to the supreme court. “It felt like we’d put up all that fight for nothing. But my legal team are not letting it drop,” she said. “And the news of the EA’s investigation has put a smile on my face, it’s given us a big boost in the fight.” In the meantime Currie, who lives half a mile away from the landfill, said the fumes were still having a major impact. “We ring up [the EA] and complain about it but it doesn’t feel like it’s getting us anywhere. Mathew is coughing so bad to the extent he’s choking,” she said. A spokesperson for the EA said it welcomed the court’s decision but added it “will not affect our determination to tackle the problems at Walleys Quarry”. They added that after the EA’s interventions, “there has been a clear downward trend in hydrogen sulphide levels recorded at our air quality monitoring stations in recent months”. A spokesperson for Walleys Quarry Ltd, an associated company of Red Industries, said: “Walleys Quarry Ltd has never received or disposed of hazardous waste in contravention of any regulations. Any allegations that it has ever done so are baseless and wrong. “There are no grounds whatsoever for this investigation or the unprofessional way it has been publicised by the EA as a supposedly responsible regulator. Despite this, the company will cooperate fully with the EA investigation so the true facts can be established and made known at the earliest opportunity.”",News/Environment,UK landfill site investigated after residents plagued by noxious fumes,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/22/uk-landfill-site-investigated-after-residents-plagued-by-noxious-fumes
12/23/2021,"A small oil painting that avoided being sold at a Spanish auction for €1,500 earlier this year after experts suggested it could be the work of the Italian master Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio has been granted protected status as an item of cultural interest. The painting of the scourged Christ, which measures 111cm by 86cm, was withdrawn from sale in April after suspicions grew that it had been incorrectly attributed to the circle of the 17th-century Spanish artist José de Ribera.  Experts at the Prado museum in Madrid, who raised the alarm, believe there is “sufficient stylistic and documentary evidence” to suggest it could be an original Caravaggio, meaning it could be worth as much as €50m (£42m). On Wednesday, six months after Spain’s culture ministry imposed a precautionary export ban on the painting, the regional government of Madrid formally declared the work a bien de interés cultural, or item of cultural interest. It described the painting as “an example of the excellence and pictorial mastery of the Italian naturalism” that had a great influence on the Madrid school of painting in the 17th century. “Elements such as the psychological depictions of the characters, the realism of the faces, the luminous force that illuminates the body of Christ, the interplay of the three characters and the communication it establishes with the viewer make this a work of great artistic interest,” the regional government said in a statement. It said the work deserved protection whoever its painter was, but that the evidence pointed towards the Italian genius. “The information that has appeared over the past few months, together with the studies undertaken by experts, reinforces the theory that it is the work of Caravaggio,” the statement said. The painting’s protected status means that its owners – the three children of Antonio Pérez de Castro, the founder of Madrid’s IADE design school, and the artist Mercedes Méndez Atard – must inform the authorities if they decided to sell it to allow the regional government to decide if it wishes to make an offer.",News/World news,Suspected Caravaggio work given protected status in Spain,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/suspected-caravaggio-work-given-protected-status-in-spain
12/23/2021,"Although she never starred in any original productions of his shows on Broadway, Richard Rodgers described Sally Ann Howes, who has died aged 91, as “the greatest singer who ever sang on the American musical stage”. Best known for playing Truly Scrumptious opposite Dick Van Dyke as Caractacus Potts in the film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968), Howes was a classic instance of the star who never really was, despite her talent and impeccable pedigree. She had dual nationality in Britain and the US, like Julie Andrews, in whose track she followed, first as a child star in British films before and after the second world war, then as Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady in 1958. The show marked her Broadway debut, and she played in it for a year, and for a higher salary than her predecessor. When Andrews declined the role of Truly Scrumptious, in she stepped.  In 1973 the hills were alive again, not with the sound of Julie, but of Sally, as she led a US tour of The Sound of Music. The upside of this nearly star status was that Howes could make surprising and adventurous choices in her work, such as appearing in a West End thriller, Lover (also 1973) by Brian Clemens, with Max Wall, or a musical version of James Joyce’s The Dead (2000), with Blair Brown and Christopher Walken, off-Broadway and, briefly, on. Although she was six years older than Andrews, the parallel career landmarks of both were uncanny. Three years before Andrews made her name in London and New York in Sandy Wilson’s The Boy Friend (1954), Howes made her stage debut in a show for which Wilson had written the lyrics, Caprice (1951), a musical comedy of domestic confusion in the south of France, at the Alhambra theatre in Glasgow. Unfortunately, on her very first number on any stage, the conductor fumbled the score to the floor and Howes had to sing unaccompanied while the music sheets were noisily gathered, the instruments picked up their places one by one and, following them tentatively, she modulated gradually back into the correct key. The show never reached the West End. Howes did, however, get there later in 1951, in a revue, Fancy Free (not the Jerome Robbins ballet) at the Prince of Wales theatre in London. In 1953 she established herself fully in the West End when she played Jennifer Rumson in Paint Your Wagon (featuring the songs Wand’rin’ Star, and I Talk to the Trees) for 18 months at Her Majesty’s theatre. In playing opposite her father, the musical comedy star Bobby Howes (the original Mr Cinders), she was at least, and at last, fulfilling her destiny. Howes was the second child of Bobby and his wife, the actor and singer Patricia Malone. Her older brother, Peter, became a musician. Born in St John’s Wood, she grew up in London and Hertfordshire surrounded by her parents’ show-business friends (Cicely Courtneidge and Jack Hulbert were neighbours), and was educated at Queenswood school in Hatfield. Her first film was the title role in Thursday’s Child (1942), written by Rodney Ackland, co-starring Wilfrid Lawson and Stewart Granger. Her prodigious juvenile output in the subsequent decade included Dead of Night (1945), an anthology horror film with Michael Redgrave, Googie Withers and Frederick Valk, the first sound screen adaptation of Nicholas Nickleby (1947; she was Kate), Anna Karenina (1948) with Vivien Leigh, The History of Mr Polly (1949), with John Mills, and Honeymoon Deferred (1951) with Kieron Moore and Griffith Jones. She later said how unhappy she was with some of these films and she eventually managed to break a seven-year contract with Rank so that she could move on to the stage. She married the actor Maxwell Coker, who had been in the first London production of Oklahoma!, in 1950 (they divorced in 1953) and then Richard Adler, the lyricist of the Broadway hits The Pajama Game and Damn Yankees, in 1958. Adler wrote Kwamina (1961) for her, a Broadway musical set in a village in west Africa which, despite choreography by Agnes de Mille, proved a misfire in a heated time of civil rights protest. “Almost liked the play, loved the loincloths,” wrote one critic, and the show closed after just 32 performances. Still on Broadway, she had a popular success in a 1963 revival of Lerner and Loewe’s Brigadoon and broadened her appeal on television on both sides of the Atlantic, making appearances on game shows and variety specials, including six Sally Ann Howes shows for British television in 1960. Having become a US citizen, she was invited to sing at the White House by three US presidents, Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. After Lover closed early in 1973, she played opposite Denis Quilley in George Bernard Shaw’s Man and Superman at the Yvonne Arnaud theatre, Guildford, and at the Adelphi theatre, London, opposite Peter Wyngarde in a sumptuous revival of The King and I, also at the Adelphi. In 1977 she joined Tommy Steele for 10 weeks in Hans Andersen at the Palladium and later played Gertrude in a touring production of Hamlet (Hilton McRae as the prince, Donald Pickering as Claudius) in 1983. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang was undoubtedly her major movie, although she was appreciably noted vying with Diane Cilento for the affections of Kenneth More’s well-mannered butler in Lewis Gilbert’s The Admirable Crichton (1957), with Cecil Parker and Martita Hunt. She also acquired a minor cult following for her part in Alvin Rakoff’s Death Ship (1980), a grisly horror movie in which she co-starred with Richard Crenna, George Kennedy and Kate Reid. By the time she appeared in the television miniseries of Judith Krantz’s Secrets in 1992, she was more often seen on stage in one-off concert appearances, such as A Little Night Music with New York City Opera in 1990, or in a Sunday charity performance such as the rarely seen Semi-Monde by Noël Coward at the Royalty theatre, London, in 1989. In 1990 she took a solo show, From This Moment On, for just three performances to the Edinburgh festival. In 1997 she sang Alice Blue Gown from the musical Irene at the Palladium in a memorial show for the critic Jack Tinker. That bizarre celebration – Tinker’s surviving critical colleagues danced chaotically through Sit Down You’re Rocking the Boat from Guys and Dolls – was produced by Cameron Mackintosh, who in 2007persuaded her to return to My Fair Lady, this time as Mrs Higgins, on yet another US tour. After divorcing Adler in 1966, Howes married Andrew Maree in 1969. They divorced in 1970 and she married Douglas Rae in 1972. Rae died in September 2021. She is survived by Andrew, a son from her marriage to Adler.

12/23/2021,"The heir to the JCB digger empire, whose father Lord Bamford is one of Boris Johnson’s biggest financial backers, is locked in a legal battle with a former close friend that has shed fresh light on alleged tensions inside one of the UK’s most powerful industrial families. The case has also raised questions over the conduct of Jo Bamford, a 43-year-old self-styled “green entrepreneur” who is a director at a key JCB holding company and has now set himself up as an investor in bus manufacturing and hydrogen.  His companies, which includes the doubledecker maker Wrightbus, have won taxpayer-funded contracts worth nearly £80m for zero-emission buses in England and Northern Ireland over the last three years. However, Bamford’s business dealings are now under scrutiny by a judge in civil proceedings in the US. US court filings and transcripts reveal he is in a bitter dispute over the ownership of a company based in Philadelphia. The documents make public for the first time Bamford’s investment in the Delaware Valley Regional Center (DVRC), one of hundreds of ventures set up to sell fast-track access to green cards under a controversial US government visa scheme known as EB-5. Bamford is suing Joseph Manheim, a former best friend, accusing him of “surreptitiously” seizing control of the joint venture and using that control to take $5.9m (£4.4m) from the business. Manheim has vigorously denied the allegations, and has brought his own counterclaim. As the dispute escalated, the two men have levelled a barrage of accusations against each other. The case went to trial in Delaware in June, giving an extraordinary insight into a world of extreme wealth and privilege within one of Britain’s most prominent industrial families. During the hearings, Bamford told the court that he raced classic Ferraris – while Manheim claimed he also collected rare pheasants. Under cross-examination, Bamford admitted to using a company email account to order cannabis and send unspecified “inappropriate, explicit photographs”. Bamford and a third founding director, who joined him as a plaintiff, have in turn accused Manheim of using company funds for outings to a strip club in Philadelphia, leasing a Porsche, and to cover the cost of playing in polo matches. In his court filings, Manheim alleged Bamford was intending to use the legal process to carry out a “bloodless coup” to seize control of the company. Both men deny any claims of wrongdoing. Manheim through his lawyers declined to comment on the cases. The final judgment on the claim and counterclaim is not expected until next year. Lawyers acting jointly for JCB, Lord Bamford and Jo Bamford said the US legal proceedings had no connection with either the digger firm or the peer. Anthony Bamford, 76, is one of the UK’s most successful industrialists, with a net worth estimated at £4.6bn. He was made a peer in 2013, campaigned for Brexit and has donated millions to the Conservative party. Jo Bamford, his eldest son, has donated £75,000 to the Tories. He may also – one day – take over the entire family business. Jo Bamford became friends with Manheim in about 2001, when the former investment banker was dating Bamford’s sister. The court hearings gave a glimpse into a once close relationship: the two men socialised and holidayed together and were godfathers to each other’s children. Bamford eventually gave Manheim access to his $2m Goldman Sachs investment account. When Manheim came up with the green card business idea in 2012, Bamford backed the venture. The equity in DVRC was split between the two friends and a third partner, all of whom would share profits equally, Bamford claimed. Through his lawyers, Bamford said he was not significantly involved in DVRC’s activities beyond attending board meetings. The company’s clients were mainly from China but also from Vietnam and South Korea, among other countries. In exchange for investments of $500,000 apiece in local road and public transport projects, and a fee paid to DVRC, they could apply for fast-track visas to live and work in the US. By January 2021, the fund holding DVRC client money had accumulated assets worth $623m from 1,246 investors, according to Manheim’s pre-trial brief. From the profits, Bamford received total distributions of $2.15m between 2016 and 2020. DVRC operated under the EB-5 programme, which allowed wealthy foreigners to effectively buy the right to live and work in the US. EB-5 is now suspended for new applicants after criticism from senators that – though legal – it presented a national security risk. Through his lawyers, Bamford said EB-5 had been reauthorised on several occasions and that DVRC was an entirely lawful business. The trial revealed allegations of unusual business practices at DVRC. Manheim and the third partner in the business visited a Philadelphia strip club called Delilah’s Den on several occasions, racking up expenses of $3,928, according to Bamford’s pre-trial brief. Manheim also allegedly took money out of the business to pay between $20,000 and $50,000 to cover the cost of playing in a polo match in Argentina, according to testimony of the third partner. According to court papers, the relationship between the business partners deteriorated in 2018. In August of that year, Manheim and the other directors agreed to dismiss Bamford from the board of a holding company. The circumstances surrounding his removal are highly contentious. Bamford claimed he was unlawfully removed. In his evidence, Manheim gave several alleged reasons for the dismissal and raised concerns about Bamford’s actions. He claimed that during a board meeting Bamford had put his interests as a shareholder ahead of his duties as a director, and not prioritised the needs of the firm and its 1,200 investors. Through his lawyers, Bamford denied the allegation. Bamford confirmed in court he had used company email accounts to order cannabis via the website Craigslist, and that he had also used his work email to send “inappropriate, explicit photographs”. During the hearings, Manheim sought to highlight alleged tensions within the Bamford family. Bamford confirmed during his testimony he had “regretfully left the family firm” in 2016 after a “difficult and painful conversation” with his father. “In essence, my dad didn’t want to stop running the business, and I didn’t want him to stop running the business,” he told the court. “And I didn’t really want to be Prince Charles, I didn’t want to be waiting for the rest of my life. I wanted to go and run my own business.” In his evidence, Manheim claimed Bamford had asked him some years ago to carry out a DNA test on his younger brother, who serves alongside him on the board of one of JCB’s companies. He alleged Bamford had given him a bag containing samples for analysis. Manheim said he never carried out the test. He claimed Bamford was often “excitable” when discussing family matters and his approach was to “let it settle down”. Through his lawyers Bamford strongly denied this incident had ever taken place. During the trial, his lawyers tried to have the claim struck out on the basis of relevance and that the allegation dated from two years before the dispute covered in the trial. But the judge overruled the objection, saying it was pertinent because “past interactions with people contribute to how one views them”, according to the court transcript. In 2019, Bamford eventually sued Manheim, accusing him of “skimming profits” to allegedly award himself more than $5.9m without the knowledge or consent of his fellow shareholders, and of fraudulently taking control of the company. He is claiming damages and wants Manheim removed and replaced by a trustee. Manheim’s request to have the case thrown out and costs paid has been rejected. In a verbal ruling on some aspects of the case at the end of the trial, the judge said there had been “an awful lot of money leaving this company for Manheim and his affiliates, and that’s where the outcome really turns”.",News/Business,"Green cards, cannabis and a strip club: JCB heir in US legal battle",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/22/green-cards-cannabis-strip-club-jcb-heir-legal-battle-jo-bamford
12/23/2021,"In a video filmed shortly before the UK hosted the Cop26 climate conference, Boris Johnson strolls alongside Jo Bamford and his father, the JCB boss, Anthony Bamford. Behind them is a JCB digger, and a big green bus is parked just across from the Houses of Parliament for a photocall. The prime minister quizzes the men about the economics of switching engines from fossil fuel to hydrogen. “It’s the same cost as running it on diesel,” Jo Bamford replies. “It’s already the same.” The video, posted by Lord Bamford’s gas distribution company, Ryze Hydrogen, on its Instagram feed in October, shows the privileged access the businessman enjoyed while lobbying for hydrogen to take a central place in Britain’s transition from fossil fuels.  The UK government this year said hydrogen, which releases only water when used as an energy source, could make up to 35% of the UK’s energy consumption by 2050 as part of its net zero plans. Bamford’s eldest son, who bears the same name as his grandfather, the JCB founder, Joseph Cyril Bamford, runs three businesses focused on hydrogen. He came to attention in 2019 by buying Wrightbus, the bankrupt maker of London buses, and plans to supply the capital with new hydrogen doubledeckers with gas provided by Ryze. More recently, he has started a fund that hopes to raise £1bn to invest in hydrogen. The Bamfords have described their vision of using hydrogen to power diggers, buses, and other parts of the economy – and they have used their political connections to promote that vision. Lord Bamford is 38th on the UK’s rich list with a net worth of £4.6bn, built up mainly through the family company, according to the Sunday Times. He is one of the big Conservative donors: the Bamfords and JCB have donated £8.7m to the party since 2002, while JCB gave various pro-Brexit groups a cumulative £670,000 before the EU referendum, according to Electoral Commission records. Jo Bamford, who like his father attended the Catholic boarding school Ampleforth, has himself donated £75,000 to the Conservatives. He also employed the MP and the former Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith as an adviser until November, paying him £60,000 a year for 20 hours’ work – the equivalent of £3,000 an hour. Smith resigned shortly after the Guardian reported on his external jobs. It has been reported that the Bamfords have also provided other benefits to the prime minister. As Johnson recovered from Covid during the first lockdown, he received luxury ready meals worth £27,000 from Daylesford Organic, the company founded by Lord Bamford’s wife, Carole, according to the Daily Mail. Johnson has also reportedly used a helicopter and private jet registered to Lord Bamford to travel on official trips and campaign visits, while JCB paid him £10,000 before a speech in January 2019 in which Johnson praised the company, six months before he won the Conservative leadership. In a 2019 election stunt Johnson drove through a polystyrene wall using a JCB digger with “get Brexit done” emblazoned on its bucket. Wrightbus has won taxpayer-funded contracts for green transport worth nearly £80m in the past three years. These include a £12m contract from Transport for London (TfL), won before Bamford’s takeover, to build England’s first fleet of hydrogen-powered doubledeckers. In December 2020 it won a £66m contract from Northern Ireland’s government for zero-emission battery and hydrogen buses; it is also providing buses to Aberdeen, Birmingham and Brighton and Hove under various taxpayer-funded schemes. Beyond the contracts, Wrightbus has said it received £6m in state funding from TfL, £5m from EU bodies, and £1m from the UK government’s Office for Zero Emission Vehicles.",News/Business,The JCB heir with big money in green energy,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/22/the-jcb-heir-with-big-money-in-green-energy
12/23/2021,"If the newly revised-down figures for Britain’s economic performance in the third quarter show anything, it is that consumers played the starring role in the recovery while the industrial sector struggled under the twin pressures of Brexit and global raw material shortages. This should not come as a surprise. Ever since 2016’s narrow vote to quit the EU, businesses, and especially manufacturers, have failed to move out of second gear.  Disruptions to supply chains come and go – remember the chaos caused by Donald Trump’s trade battles with China – while Brexit is ever-present. Trade figures show a 8.8% fall in goods exports from July to the end of September, at a time when global trade was booming as coronavirus restrictions had eased. France, which has a similarly sized economy to the UK’s, was also experiencing supply chain issues holding back manufacturing. But the lack of computer chips and vital components for cars only prevented French firms from enjoying an even stronger surge in production and exports. British manufacturing, meanwhile, was, in addition, suffering from a decline in the workforce after thousands of people from abroad left or were deterred from coming by draconian visa rules and the UK’s handling of Covid-19. The staff shortages were made worse by what has become known as the great resignation, with almost one in four workers planning a job change. For manufacturers, the problem is less about families calling time on long commutes and more about the high levels of long Covid that have hit their older, skilled workers. Then there is the trend for early retirement, much of it related to health issues. France, meanwhile, has enjoyed a mass return to work that has pushed the participation rate above pre-pandemic levels. The official figures also point to another troubling UK trend that strips away the gloss provided by low unemployment and high levels of vacancies. The Office for National Statistics said revised data for business investment showed the money spent upgrading plant, machinery and IT fell by 2.5% in the third quarter – revised down from an increase of 0.4% when the ONS made its first stab at a figure. It means investment across businesses large and small remains a hefty 11.7% below that in the fourth quarter of 2019, despite the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, handing firms tax relief on investment worth 130% of profits to spur an revival. Low business investment is an indicator of poor economic health and probably the most telling indicator of UK firms’ reluctance to bet on a brighter future. There was better news from figures for consumer spending growth, which was 2.7% higher compared with its previous estimate of 2%, making it the largest contributor to headline GDP growth in the quarter by some margin. Much of the extra spending was on restaurants and leisure activities, as previously hibernating households ventured outside during the summer and autumn. Revised figures showed consumer spending was also more resilient during the previous lockdowns, going back to March 2020, indicating the cliff-edge drop in activity in the spring last year was less than first estimated and the momentum of spending going into 2021 was stronger. The ONS said the output loss during the initial phase in the pandemic was smaller than thought and GDP was just 1.5% below its pre-pandemic peak in 2019, rather than the 2.1% previously reported. That said, the reliance on consumer spending meant the momentum was weaker than first estimated and the third-quarter growth figure was just 1.1%, down from 1.3%. With manufacturers slipping from second gear into reverse during the autumn – output dropped back 0.7% in the third quarter – and construction output following the same negative trajectory – down 1% in the same period – consumer spending will need to soar in the new year to make up the difference. Omicron has probably put paid to that.",News/Business,How twin pressures of Brexit and raw material shortage damaged GDP,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/22/how-twin-pressures-of-brexit-and-raw-material-shortage-damaged-gdp
12/23/2021,"The European Commission has begun legal action against Poland over rulings by the country’s constitutional court that challenged the supremacy of EU law, in an escalation of the long-running battle between Brussels and Warsaw. The EU executive said it had “serious concerns” about the Polish constitutional tribunal and its recent case law, citing rulings where the court had challenged the primacy of EU law.  Striking at the heart of the EU legal order, Poland’s constitutional tribunal ruled in July that measures imposed by the European court of justice were unconstitutional, with warnings of a legal “Polexit”. Poland agreed on the supremacy of EU law when it became a member of the bloc in 2004, but the rightwing nationalist Law and Justice (Pis) government that came to power in 2015 has sought to challenge that principle, while bringing domestic courts under political control. The EU’s legal action is in response to the July ruling and a similar one from October. It follows years of legal wrangling over the independence of Polish courts. In a sign that patience is wearing thin in Brussels, the EU commissioner for justice, Didier Reynders, said: “We’ve tried to engage in a dialogue, but the situation is not improving. Fundamentals of the EU legal order, notably the primacy of EU law, must be respected.” The commission also said it had “serious doubts” about the independence and impartiality of the Polish constitutional tribunal, a body that now includes former PiS MPs on its bench. Retired judges of the tribunal have said the court has “ceased to perform its constitutional tasks and duties” since its membership was overhauled. Poland’s government claimed the legal action was an attack on its sovereignty. “The EC is initiating proceedings and wants to subordinate the constitutional tribunal in Poland to EU law,” tweeted the deputy justice minister, Sebastian Kaleta. “This is an attack on the Polish constitution and our sovereignty.” Beata Szydło, who was Poland’s prime minister from 2015 to 2017 and is now an MEP, tweeted: “This is not a legal dispute, but an attack on the Polish constitution [and] the foundations of Polish statehood. The EC aims to deprive Poland of its rights as a sovereign state.” Legal scholars said the action was important but overdue. “It’s great that this is happening and there’s no way the commission could retain any credibility in the rule of law field by letting the adventures of [the] Polish constitutional tribunal slide,” wrote Jakub Jaraczewski, a researcher at Democracy Reporting International. Poland’s government now has two months to respond to the commission’s “letter of formal notice”. The case could go to the European court of justice, leading to daily fines against Warsaw. It is only the latest in a blizzard of legal cases against Poland launched by the commission, which has also frozen Warsaw’s access to €35.6bn (£30.2bn) in coronavirus recovery funds because of concerns about the absence of independent courts.",News/World news,Brussels launches legal action over Polish rulings against EU law,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/brussels-launches-legal-action-over-polish-rulings-against-eu-law
12/23/2021,"It was spring, and human excrement was pumping into our garden. I watched through the window as a perplexed young plumber with a long metal pole excavated the dark, gurgling drain. As if lockdown hadn’t been bad enough, our kitchen was now heavy with the stench of a thousand flushes. No one knew how to stop it. There was only one thing to do: brew weapons-grade black coffee and switch on the radio. That’s how I discovered Huey Morgan’s Saturday morning breakfast show on BBC 6 Music. It made everything feel a little more right in the world. What started as a way to distract from the tide of hot, liquid excrement on our patio quickly became the highlight of the week for my girlfriend and me. Huey – of Fun Lovin’ Criminals fame – thumbing you through his records: early 90s rap, early 80s disco, and early 70s soul to blow away the cobwebs, with choice modern selections marbling the retro soundscape.  As the pandemic wrecked his live music opportunities, ex-marine turned platinum-selling artist Morgan swapped the remnants of his old rockstar lifestyle for a wholesome three-hour set in Britain’s coveted hungover fry-up slot. Morgan admits he has had “essentially the same record collection for 35 years”, and yet the show never feels formulaic. “I’m proud of my music,” he says. His enthusiasm for his own taste is infectious and it’s hard not to follow that confidence. He doesn’t ask you to trust his choices; you just do. When we speak, it’s Monday afternoon, a significant point in the weekly creation of the Huey Show. The process is always the same “I start compiling my show on Monday afternoon, writing down ideas in my Moleskine [notebook]. And then – and this is very important for me – I put together a playlist and drive to Costco in Avonmouth. I’m American, and they have all my American shit, so I drive there and get my hotdogs and listen to the music.” On Tuesday, he sends the playlist to his producer, T-Bone. He records the show in the basement of his home in Bath on Wednesday, then sends it to the BBC for vetting on Thursday. (“They wanna make sure I don’t say fuck,” he says.) Then, if the show is profanity-free, it rolls out on Saturday, 10am-1pm. It is soothing to realise the person putting together the perfect soundtrack for the inane-but-important Saturday mornings of young coupledom – scrubbing ovens, vacuuming stairs, splitting your kittens’ worming tablets in half, prying open their little jaws – is going about his own inane, but important, routine. “I need something to look forward to every week,” says Morgan of his 2021. “I have my family, and they’re lovely. But I need discipline.” So Morgan pieces together his show, while hunting for frankfurters in a Greater Bristol industrial park. Every single Monday. His presence on the Huey Show is that of a pithy tour guide, never outstaying his welcome. “When I was younger,” he says, “and I’d DJ in New York nightclubs, they didn’t even give me a microphone. Nobody wanted to hear what I had to say. I try to keep that humility.” He plays you a little Arlo Parks or A Tribe Called Quest, some Joe Bataan if you’re lucky, and throws down some dad-joke wordplay, and a raspy half-laugh, then it’s back to the music. “I started the show in 2008,” says Morgan, “and I’ve never been the kind of DJ, where – well, you hear ’em. You know who they are. They just love talking, man. And they talk so much, you don’t even know what the fuck they’re talking about by the time they play the record. That’s what I try to avoid.” Routines that stick have been hard to come by in the pandemic. After 2020’s attempts at regularly scheduled spiritual nourishment didn’t take – quizzes, jogging and YouTube yoga are now a long distant memory – I had given up trying. Monday and Tuesday might have always been crap, but, without the opportunity for football on a Wednesday, cinema on a Thursday and post-work pints on a Friday, my calendar’s arrhythmia left me jaded. But, each Saturday morning, the Huey Show injected something vital. Ever since that effluent February morning, I’ve come to cherish Morgan’s calming sonic antidote to the apocalyptic news cycle, his warm Noo Yawk accent cradling us till lunch. Through the week, I count down the days to each show, wondering what will be ringing around our kitchen. The vibe he creates, I tell him over the phone, makes a Saturday morning feel like an easy Sunday – only without the dread. His show is a mood that transports me away from the molten faecal hellscape bubbling up on society’s block paving. More than a show, it’s become an idealised soundtrack to my new pandemic reality. “I’m flattered people include me in moments in their lives,” he tells me, Costco beckoning. “Getting married, people passing away, babies being born, anniversaries, milestones. They genuinely wanna share them with me because I share what I have with them, man. And people can tell when it’s real. This is a bullshit-free zone. I’m not a presenter. I’m not a comedian. You don’t need me telling you my opinion on all the bad shit happening in the world. And I’m not curing cancer here, but if I can keep people away from bullshit for a couple hours and play good music for ’em, then that’s my lane. And I like it.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,The person who got me through 2021: Huey Morgan comforted me amid a deluge of human waste,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/22/the-person-who-got-me-through-2021-huey-morgan-comforted-me-amid-a-deluge-of-human-waste
12/23/2021,"Spain’s Christmas lottery, a lucrative and much-loved annual tradition that often ends in the joyous detonation of cava corks and the hatching of big plans, took place on Wednesday amid soaring Covid infections and the first ever strike by ticket vendors. After the country recorded a record 49,823 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday night, many Spaniards welcomed the chance to focus instead on El Gordo (the Fat One) and its €2.4bn in prizes.  As tradition dictates, the draw for the lottery, which dates back to 1812, was held at the Teatro Real opera house in Madrid, with children from the city’s San Ildefonso school calling out the winning numbers. For the December draw, many Spaniards club together to buy tickets, or fractions of them. But as the celebrations began across Spain, dozens of lottery ticket vendors assembled outside the opera house to demand an increased share of the sales revenues. The vendors, who had shut up shop for the day, say they deserve more than the 4% of the ticket price they currently get, arguing that 80 cents on a €20 ticket is not enough. They point out that their commission rate has been frozen for the past 17 years despite huge rises in living costs – not least Spain’s skyrocketing electricity prices. “Prices go up, taxes go up and the commissions remain the same,” Natalia de la Fuente, the daughter of a lottery seller, told Reuters. “We have to pay our bills … This is impossible.” Another protester, Álvaro de Miguel, said he and his fellow vendors would do “whatever it takes to get people to listen to us”. This year’s winning number, 86148, paid out a €400,000 prize. A stall at Madrid’s Atocha train station reportedly sold tickets that won their buyers – who probably come from all round Spain – a total of €516m. “I’m super excited,” said the stallholder, 56-year-old Javier Moñino. “Most of the people who bought them were people who passed by my window on their way through the station.”",News/World news,Draw deal: Spain’s El Gordo lottery hit by ticket vendor strike,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/spain-el-gordo-christmas-lottery-ticket-vendor-strike
12/23/2021,"Gyms, swimming pools and leisure centres in the UK have appealed for a government rethink after being excluded from the £1bn Omicron business support package. Huw Edwards, the chief executive of the industry body UKactive, said the government’s decision to leave out sports facilities from grants of up to £6,000 and rebates on sick pay was shameful, and would “lead to businesses that support the health and wellbeing of communities going to the wall”.  “This is a health crisis, so to dismiss calls for support from these essential organisations that improve people’s health is inexcusable and will lead to our nation’s physical activity levels – which are already in a lamentable state – becoming even worse,” he said. “We urge the government to think again.” Sports facilities had initially thought they were included in the support package, which the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said applied to the “hospitality and leisure sectors”. However, it emerged overnight that pools, gyms and leisure centres would not be eligible. Mark Sesnan, the chief executive of Better, which runs more than 200 leisure centres, largely for local authorities, said the company had spent nine months rebuilding its business to 80% of pre-pandemic attendance, only to see a 20% to 30% drop in recent weeks as the government advised the public to work from home and limit social contact because of Omicron. “The shift to working from home has been hard for city centre businesses including cafes, restaurants and gyms. We have the same problem so it is a bit bizarre we are left out of venue support. The government has to accept that if it is going to discourage people from doing things there is a financial consequence and support needs to go equally to all businesses [affected].” Sesnan said Better was continuing to keep its facilities open in the hope that the fall-off in business was short-term. But he said that without a rise in attendance or government support, it would be forced to cut jobs and reduce opening hours. The outcry comes after a group of independent gyms wrote to the prime minister, warning the sector was “on a knife-edge fighting for survival” and needed urgent support before its peak period in January and February, when they can book in as much as half of annual earnings. Several London-based operators, including Frame, which has seven sites, Triyoga, which has five, and 1Rebel, with nine gyms, called for the reintroduction of furlough payments, urgent financial support via grants and a reduction in VAT as the industry heads into the post-festive health kick. Sandy Macaskill, co-founder of Barry’s UK, which also backed the open letter, said: “It’s like dark comedy that we’re in a national health crisis and the very industry that keeps people fit and healthy is the one that continues to be ignored. I read somewhere that the latest support package is like a dud Christmas cracker. We don’t even get one of those.” Rebecca Passmore, the UK managing director of PureGym, one of the leading chains, said: “We echo calls on the government to reconsider its latest support measures, which exclude gyms, pools, and leisure centres. Recent government action has impacted gym-goers behaviour, particularly the guidance to work from home, and as a result city centre and boutique gym operators face real financial difficulty. “Gyms are a critical sector for the health and wellbeing of the nation and the decision to exclude gyms from any financial support in the current environment is therefore disappointing. Unless the government takes action now to help these operators they may well not survive the coming months, which would have a direct impact on the nation’s ability to improve its health.”",News/World news,UK gyms hit out after being excluded from £1bn Omicron support,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/uk-gyms-and-leisure-centres-issue-plea-for-omicron-support-cash
12/23/2021,"An hour before kickoff Tuesday, a pair of seats under cover at rainy Lincoln Financial Field for the Philadelphia Eagles’ must-win NFL game against Washington could be snapped up on Ticketmaster.com for $50 each. That is a savings of 75%, sports fans. Someone bought those tickets for $190 each some months ago in the hopes of sitting in them, or selling them for even more money, but the coronavirus wrecks a lot of plans now. The game was postponed for two days after the virus hit the Washington roster especially hard.  It was not freezing in South Philly, and incentive to go came hours earlier, when the Flyers-Capitals NHL game next door at the same time was postponed by the virus, meaning less traffic to battle. Still, resale tickets to a game that shaped the NFC playoff field dove to $41. Just because a game is slapped with the NFL seal of approval does not mean people need to pay anything close to face value for tickets to go watch at the last minute. It might be like this for a while. Welcome to the sports world as tested by the tenacious Omicron variant. We shall see if it drives the monolithic National Football League to its knees. Hockey, basketball and even baseball are much more nimble, in that rosters are much smaller and games draw smaller crowds. Some 28 of 32 NFL teams average 60,000 per home game. The NFL was somewhat fortunate in that it had just entered the offseason when Covid first swept through the US in 2020, and later would subside in time for the NFL to contest, very carefully, an entire season, albeit in mostly empty stadiums. The end came with a giant sigh. Tuesday was another odd day in sports. The NHL said it was taking a longer holiday break than planned because of the effects of the virus – before the news broke that its players won’t go to the Beijing Olympics. The league now needs that time to make up postponements. NBA commissioner Adam Silver told ESPN later in the day that the league’s big annual Christmas Day slate of five games would go on despite the postponements of several regular season games. But the league had told the 10 teams involved that that schedule could change. Several college basketball games were either postponed or canceled outright, though no one has dared broach the possibility that the almighty March Madness would be affected, delayed or even wiped out, as it was in 2020. Besides, that is more than two full months away. Meanwhile, the NFL squeezed in two games on what is usually an off-day for players. Philadelphia (7-7) beat the Football Team (6-8), 27-17, and the Rams (10-4) beat Seattle (5-9), 20-10. Just getting them in was great news, because teams don’t have to give money back. Both crowds were near capacities: 69,796 in Philadelphia, 71,192 in L.A. Another postponed game was made up Monday at rush hour in Cleveland, where a $55 front-row seat in the upper deck could be purchased on the resale market for $16. The Las Vegas Raiders kept their slim playoff hopes alive with a last-second game-winning field goal, but that game had an announced paid crowd of 67,431, a sellout. Whether the game was as good as it could have been in the old days, before Covid, is another question. Cleveland coach Kevin Stefanski missed the game because he tested positive, and so did the Browns’ top two quarterbacks, Baker Mayfield and Case Keenum. Nick Mullens, who did play QB, was hardly embarrassing, but hardly Bernie Kosar, either. That also describes the Washington QB: Garrett Gilbert, a 30-year-old journeyman who was signed by the Football Team off the New England Patriots practice squad last week in case Washington’s first two QBs could not lick Covid in time. Gilbert, who has played in games for four different teams in the last four years, did just fine against the Eagles, throwing for 194 yards. But the Eagles all but handed him a touchdown on a goofy pass that was dropped, kicked and intercepted, and he could get only one more. Not that he used it as an excuse, Gilbert said it had been challenging to blend in, because his new teammates wore masks most of the time. “It is tough to see anyone’s face to be honest with you and to put faces with names. It is not ideal, but it is what it is. There is nothing we can do about that.” Nevertheless, the Eagles and their fans were furious when the postponement was announced, because the Football Team, to them, had been less keen on avoiding the virus. As a result of the postponement, the Eagles would have just four days to prepare for another game. That Gilbert was so capable in a remarkable pinch reflects well on him – but also to just how amazingly deep the reservoir is of pro football players in reserve. This is why new pro football leagues spin off all the time; there are a lot of good players we don’t know about. And yet, even the NFL can’t go on a whole lot longer if it keeps draining its stock. The schedule is brutal even without a pandemic, with 17 regular-season games instead of 16 this year, made more important because of a playoff bracket expanded last year to 14 teams. Following the two games Tuesday, each NFL team has somehow played 14 games, before crowds as big as they were before the pandemic. They still need to each get through three more before the playoffs, 13 more games, can even start. A lot can still go haywire. More games might be held on weird days and times when fans won’t be able to attend, let alone tailgate. Some teams might have fill-in head coaches and rosters filled with less-than-name players rescued from the practice squad, or unemployment. But, still. When the Eagles scored their final touchdown to put Washington too far behind, the home fans appeared to celebrate just as heartily as they would have if Sonny Jurgensen or even Taylor Heinecke had been the losing quarterback. Maybe their team’s turn in the Omicron barrel comes next week. Maybe not.

12/23/2021,"The NHS may set up “field hospitals” in the carparks of existing hospitals staffed partly by army medical personnel to help cope with a potential Omicron-driven surge in Covid patients. Hospital canteens, offices and meeting rooms could also be turned into makeshift wards if the new variant leaves so many people seriously ill that the health service may be overwhelmed.  NHS England has told hospital bosses to make plans to take both steps in the coming weeks as part of a series measures to give the service “super-surge” extra capacity. However, it will only order the implementation of such dramatic and unprecedented moves if Omicron leads to even greater numbers of patients with Covid needing treatment than during the last peak in January. The plans, first reported by the Health Service Journal (HSJ), come amid deepening fears that the numbers of health staff off work sick with Covid could hamper the NHS’s response to Omicron. One in 10 doctors are off work in the UK, figures revealed on Wednesday, as medical leaders warned the highly transmissible new variant was fuelling the worst absence rates in the NHS since the start of the pandemic. A survey conducted by the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) found 10.5% of doctors were absent. The picture is worse in London, where one in seven doctors are off work (13.9%). The number of absences is growing, the RCP said, leaving “exhausted and demoralised” staff on wards struggling to cope with the pressure of more cases coupled with mounting winter pressures. The high absence rate among doctors is likely to be due to the high community levels of infection and rapid transmission of the Omicron variant, the RCP said. “Absence is the worst we have seen during the pandemic other than at the end of March 2020,” said Dr Andrew Goddard, the president of the RCP. “Today, we have a tired and demoralised workforce that has been managing the impact of the pandemic for almost two years, we are trying to deliver as much non-Covid care as possible and we have the usual winter rise in other respiratory conditions.” NHS England has told hospitals to be ready to create “major incident capacity” in January as it braces for a potential major wave of Covid cases needing inpatient care then. The new facilities would be in effect large tents, where up to 100 patients would be cared for, HSJ said. It quotes one NHS leader describing the new facilities as “lots of little Nightingales”, a reference to the seven field hospitals set up last year in England to give the health service extra capacity when the first wave of Covid hit in March. However, they were little used and have since been mothballed. It is likely that they would be used for the least sick, with existing hospitals looking after the most seriously unwell, including those needing oxygen to support their breathing. They will be staffed by a combination of both clinically trained personnel and also administrative staff who have no medical background, one official with knowledge of the plans said. NHS England disclosed the plans to hospital bosses on a series of regional conference calls on Tuesday. It expects that Army medical staff will be involved, though the HSJ said that no formal request for such help had been made yet. Staff both with and without a clinical background working for clinical commissioning groups, the local NHS bodies that commission and pay for health services in an area, will also be asked to help out. An executive at one hospital said that it was already sounding out staff who usually work in a purely administrative capacity about what roles they could take on if Omicron wreaks havoc. NHS leaders are keen to sort out which staff will undertake what work in existing and field hospitals given that the Nightingales set up last year were hobbled by hospitals having too few staff to be able to sed all bt a handful on secondment to the newly created facilities. Medical leaders on Wednesday issued a fresh plea to the public to exercise extreme caution over the festive period, warning that if infection levels continued to rise, the NHS could see the number of staff working plunge to “very dangerous” levels. Goddard added: “NHS colleagues will always be ready to do what is needed, but we needn’t be in this situation. If we had proper NHS workforce planning, taking into account current and likely future demand, I predict we would have many more thousand doctors, nurses and other clinicians. “As we don’t have that capacity, we urge everyone to arrange to have their vaccinations and boosters as soon as possible. And while we are all looking forward to time with loved ones this year, we need to think very carefully about the number of people we mix with over the next couple of weeks. That’s not a message people want to hear and not one it’s easy to deliver, but if we aren’t cautious, we risk the number of available health and care staff falling to very dangerous levels.” The government has cut the self-isolation period for people who have coronavirus from 10 days to a week, but ministers accept the move might only relieve some of the pressure around staff shortages.",News/World news,NHS may set up ‘field hospitals’ in carparks to cope with Omicron,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/nhs-may-set-up-field-hospitals-in-carparks-to-cope-with-omicron-covid
