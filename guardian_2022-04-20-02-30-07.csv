4/20/2022,"My brother Malcolm Ball, who has died aged 61 of cancer, made a lasting contribution to the lives of young people in south-east London through his youth work in Lewisham. In 2003 he co-founded, with his colleague Denis Hunter, the innovative Lewisham Young Mayor Project, encouraging young people in the borough to engage in local politics. Each year a young mayor is elected, and the chosen person has an annual budget to work with and a cabinet of volunteer advisers to implement the manifesto. The idea has been much copied at home and abroad, and Malcolm and the young people involved helped a number of continental European towns to set up their own versions, including in Poland, Portugal, the Czech Republic and Sweden. Malcolm was born in Greenwich to Irish parents: Mary (nee Connerney), a school dinner lady, and Joseph, a bricklayer. Growing up on the Milton Court estate in Deptford, he went to St Thomas the Apostle school in Peckham and worked as a teenage volunteer in youth clubs and adventure playgrounds before deciding to take a sociology degree at Bedford College, University of London, in 1980. After qualifying in a youth work and community development at Leicester Polytechnic (now De Montfort University), he took up a post at the St Andrew’s Centre in Brockley and by the mid-1990s was a senior worker at the Lewisham Youth Service, where he helped to set up the Deptford Youth Forum, developed the borough-wide Youth Participation Project and occasionally lectured at Goldsmiths’ College (now Goldsmiths, University of London). The Lewisham Young Mayor Project grew out of the Youth Participation Project and Malcolm was an adviser to it until his death. However, he always deliberately remained a frontline youth worker, being someone who shunned formalities, disliked professional preciousness and concentrated instead on removing barriers. Over the years he was a key member of the Socialist Caucus of the Community and Youth Workers’ Union and was involved in the creation of a number of activist groups related to youth work, including the Leicester Community Education Workers support group, the Revolutionary Socialist Network and In Defence of Youth Work. He was immensely proud of Lewisham’s anti-racist history. He loved to take visitors on his own guided tour of Deptford, starting at the town hall, where the Black People’s Day of Action march had gathered in 1981. After almost 20 years together he and Amanda Brown, whom he had met when she worked in Deptford as a community legal adviser, became civil partners in 2021. He is survived by Amanda, his stepson, Emil, and his siblings, me and Joel.",News/Society,Malcolm Ball obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/19/malcolm-ball-obituary
4/20/2022,"The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, broke down in tears during an interview in which she condemned the “cruelty” of a wave of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation sweeping Republican states. Known for her toughness at the briefing room podium, Psaki showed a more emotional side during the discussion with Jessica Yellin, host of the News Not Noise podcast, in an interview released on Tuesday. “They’re doing that in a way that is harsh and cruel to a community of kids, especially,” Psaki said, in tears, after Yellin asked her to “make sense” of the Republican push for legislation that marginalises the LBGTQ+ community. “I’m going to get emotional about this issue because it’s horrible. But it’s kids who are bullied, and all these leaders are taking steps to hurt them, and hurt their lives and hurt their families. “And you look at some of these laws in these states and who’s going after parents, who are in loving relationships, who have kids. It’s completely outrageous. Sorry, this is an issue that makes me completely crazy.” Analysts say the wave of legislation, prominently including Florida’s so-called “don’t say gay” bill, which attacks the teaching of LGBTQ+ issues, is designed to provoke “gender grievance” among voters ahead of November’s midterm elections. “What we’re talking about here in Florida, for example … if you have a kid in a classroom, and I have a kindergartner, I can imagine her saying, ‘My friend has two moms. My friend has two dads’,” Psaki said. “And the teacher in her classroom, I would hope would say, ‘That’s wonderful. They’re loving parents, and you have a mom and a dad.’ “This is penalising teachers and educators. There are so many layers of this that are outrageous, and I hope people continue to educate themselves on this because it is a bad side of politics.”",News/US news,Jen Psaki in tears during interview on Republican anti-LGBTQ ‘cruelty’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/19/jen-psaki-tears-republican-anti-lgbtq-bills
4/20/2022,"My friend Elise Bayley, who has died aged 91, worked for the Plunkett Foundation for Co-operative Studies (subsequently the Plunkett Foundation) for 17 years in various capacities, including as the librarian and information officer. She also was custodian of the diaries and letters left to the organisation by its founder, Sir Horace Curzon Plunkett, a pioneer of agricultural co-operatives and MP. Born in Woodchester, Gloucestershire, to Florence (nee Lockwood), a concert violinist, Elise grew up at the boys’ preparatory school Aylesford House in St Albans, where her father, Harold Bayley, was the headteacher. In 1950, aged 20, she graduated with a teaching diploma in piano, flute and singing from the Royal Academy of Music. Wishing to pursue languages, in 1955 she joined the travel agents Thomas Cook, where she worked for 15 years as a seasonal resident representative, spending the five-month season each year mainly in Italy. She completed a BA degree in English in 1974 at the University of Southampton, followed by a diploma in library and information studies at University College London in 1976. The same year, Elise joined the Plunkett Foundation. She amassed deep knowledge of the books, journals, business reports and research publications held in the library, and was, for many, the first point of contact for visitors from all over the world wishing to study farmer-controlled business development in the UK. Elise’s network of contacts in co-operative businesses was extensive, and stemmed not only from the Plunkett Foundation’s reputation as a clearing house, but also her individual skill as a communicator and facilitator. She organised educational programmes for numerous Nuffield-funded visitors from developing countries who wished to study agricultural co-operative development in the UK. Elise’s programmes had fabulous itineraries, including travelling the length and breadth of the UK for observation, talks and meetings, and always featuring several week-long working attachments. Elise was co-editor of the research serial the Year Book of Agricultural Co-operation (1980-86) and subsequently co-editor of the Year Book of Co-operative Enterprise (1988-93). She also undertook work assignments for the Plunkett Foundation in Poland, Bangladesh, Hungary and France. The day after Elise retired from the Plunkett Foundation, on her 63rd birthday in 1993, she began work as a volunteer at the Oxfam bookshop in St Giles, Oxford. From 2014 Elise fiercely resisted slowly progressing dementia, living in sheltered accommodation, and then two care homes in the Surrey Hills. Elise is survived by her siblings, Michael and Elaine.",News/Society,Elise Bayley obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2022/apr/19/elise-bayley-obituary
4/20/2022,"The Catalan president has called on the Spanish government to launch an “official and independent investigation” into how and why he and more than 60 figures associated with the regional independence movement reportedly had their mobile phones targeted using NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware. Pere Aragonès told the Guardian that the alleged targeting, revealed by Citizen Lab cybersecurity experts on Monday, constituted a violation of individual rights, an attack on democracy, and a threat to political dissent. “My phone was targeted because of my political duties – first as regional vice-president, and then as regional president,” he said. “That goes beyond what was done to me as an individual and as a citizen. They were also attacking the democratically elected institution that is the Catalan government, which is an attack on all Catalan citizens and institutions, and, as such, an attack on democracy.” According to Citizen Lab, Aragonès and his three pro-independence predecessors were among at least 65 individuals whose phones were targeted or infected with mercenary spyware using fake texts or WhatsApp messages. Almost all the incidents took place between 2017 – the year of the failed bid for Catalan regional independence – and 2020. Although NSO Group claims that Pegasus is sold only to governments to track criminals and terrorists, a joint investigation two years ago by the Guardian and El País established that the speaker of the Catalan regional parliament and at least two other pro-independence supporters were warned the spyware had been used to target them. Aragonès said the apparent spying had been on such a “massive scale” that it could not have escaped the attention of the Spanish authorities. Nor, he added, was it likely to have been the work of a single agent within Spain’s National Intelligence Centre (CNI). “Big and significant resources would have been needed to set up this spying system,” he said. “There are also approval processes that intelligence services need to go through, and that obviously means that this couldn’t have gone unnoticed.” The Catalan president said that while spying on any citizen was a serious matter, the apparent use of Pegasus against politicians, lawyers and civil society groups was particularly worrying. “As far as we’re concerned, it’s absolutely essential that there’s an official and independent investigation into whether, in this case, the CNI, or the Policía Nacional or the Guardia Civil police forces of the Spanish state have used this programme,” he said. “We need to know exactly how many times it was used, against whom, and with what justification. That will determine who was responsible. A government can’t say that it didn’t know what was going on. If it didn’t know, it needs to find out who was responsible internally – because this is about persecuting political dissent.” Aragonès said that while the targeting had “decimated” trust in the Spanish government, his administration was still open to finding a negotiated solution to the political conflict that plunged Spain into crisis almost give years ago. He also warned the use of spyware such as Pegasus needed to be addressed around the world because “we’re dealing with behaviour here that hasn’t only happened in Catalonia”. Even if Pegasus were to disappear, Aragonès added, new software would soon take its place. “We need limits on this technological intrusion into people’s privacy,” he said. “At the end of the day, a mobile phone is an extension of our own personal and private life. It’s essential that there are independent mechanisms to verify that governments are not using tools that were developed to tackle terrorists against political rivals or adversaries.” Citizen Lab and Amnesty International have also called for an official inquiry into the matter. The Spanish government has denied any wrongdoing, while the Policía Nacional and the Guardia Civil have said they have had no dealings whatsoever with NSO groups and have never used its services. Speaking on Tuesday afternoon, the government’s spokesperson, Isabel Rodríguez, said the allegations of spying were not new and had already been addressed by the government. “But I’d like to reiterate our position, which is that the government has nothing to hide – absolutely nothing,” she said. “And so the government will cooperate fully with the justice system and any investigations into these matters if that’s what is asked by the courts. I’d also like to stress that Spain is a democratic state with full rule of law. As such, any limitation on the fundamental rights of requires a judicial decision to be taken.” Rodríguez said the Socialist-led coalition government would not put up with Spain’s “democratic quality” being called into question. However, she said she could not comment on whether the CNI had access to Pegasus or whether it had ever deployed the programme. “There are matters that relate to national security that are protected by law and are classified material – secret matters – and I can’t get into that,” said Rodríguez. “The law prohibits it.” The CNI has previously told the Guardian and El País that its work is overseen by the supreme court and that it acts “in full accordance with the legal system, and with absolute respect for the applicable laws”. A spokesperson for NSO said: “NSO continues to be targeted by a number of politically motivated advocacy organisations like Citizen Labs and Amnesty to produce inaccurate and unsubstantiated reports based on vague and incomplete information. “We have repeatedly cooperated with governmental investigations, where credible allegations merit. However, information raised regarding these allegations are, yet again, false and could not be related to NSO products for technological and contractual reasons.”",News/World news,Catalan president calls for investigation as spyware targets pro-independence leaders,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/19/catalan-president-calls-for-investigation-as-spyware-targets-pro-independence-leaders
4/20/2022,"The UK’s failure to designate inland bathing waters has a long and sorry history (How to turn England’s rivers from filthy sewers into shining streams, 18 April). When I was the lawyer for Surfers Against Sewage from 1992 to 2000, we regularly berated both Tory and Labour administrations (and the Environment Agency) for their persistent refusal to comply with the bathing water directive, which the European Commission had passed as long ago as 1976. The directive was and is intended to apply to waters where bathing is “traditionally practised by a large number of bathers”. Whereas it was largely taken on board by most European countries (even Luxembourg had 33 sites), the UK devoted huge amounts of time and money into avoiding compliance wherever possible. The only plausible reason for this foot-dragging was to protect the profits and dividend payments of what were then the newly privatised water companies. That remains the only reason for the UK’s continued failure to designate bathing waters and protect the health of thousands of citizens every year. Now that we’ve left the EU, I suspect that the chances of this government complying with an EU directive are about as good as finding a non-sewage-polluted stretch of inland water anywhere in the UK.Charlie HopkinsPlanning and environmental consultant, Axminster, Devon  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

4/20/2022,"One person has died and several people are in a critical condition in Sri Lanka after police opened fire on a crowd who were protesting against rising fuel prices and the country’s economic crisis. Police confirmed they had fired on a group who had been blocking a railway in the town of Rambukkana, about 60 miles from Colombo, for more than eight hours. They were demonstrating against the devastating fuel and oil shortages in the country and the decision to raise fuel prices further this week. The death is the first fatality caused by police since overwhelmingly peaceful protests erupted spontaneously across the country in recent weeks to call for the government to step down as Sri Lanka faces its worst economic crisis since independence. Twelve people were also reported to have been injured in Tuesday’s incident, with two in a critical condition. As Sri Lanka’s foreign reserves have fallen to record lows and the country faces bankruptcy, the government has been unable to afford fuel and oil imports, leading to mass shortages and widespread anger. At least three people have died in the lengthy queues outside petrol stations. Citizens have faced weeks of food and medicine shortages, unaffordable inflation and daily power blackouts of 13 hours. According to police, the protester in Rambukkana had been refusing to move from a railway line and had parked a fuel truck across the tracks. Police fired teargas in an attempt to disperse the crowds, an action that appeared to provoke the protester, and the police responded by firing live rounds. Video footage from the scene shows a senior officer instructing others dressed in full riot gear: “Fire, fire and chase them out.” Dr Mihiri Priyangani, who worked in a government hospital in nearby Kegalle, confirmed that 13 people had been admitted with suspected gunshot wounds. One had died while two others were undergoing surgery. A curfew was imposed on Rambukka on Tuesday night. The Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission said they had formed a three-person panel and would be investigating the incident. While there had been some initial clashes between protesters and police when the protests began last month, in recent weeks they had remained largely peaceful. Thousands have continued to gather in Colombo on a daily basis to call for the government to step down, with minimal police or military interference, and this was the first time that deadly force had been deployed. In a statement, Amnesty said it was “concerned about the disturbing reports emerging of at least one death and more than 10 injured after the police opened fire at protesters in Rambukkana today. The authorities must always exercise restraint and use no more force than is strictly necessary.” The US ambassador to Sri Lanka, Julie Chung, said she was “deeply saddened by the horrible news coming out of Rambukkana” and called for a “transparent, independent” investigation into events.",News/World news,Sri Lanka: One dead and several wounded as police shoot protesters,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/19/sri-lanka-one-dead-and-several-wounded-as-police-shoot-protesters
