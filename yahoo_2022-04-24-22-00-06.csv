4/24/2022,"A Russian general announced plans to occupy the Transnistria region of Moldova on Friday. Speaking at a defense industry meeting, Brigadier General Rustam Minnekayev, acting commander of Russia’s Central Military District, stated that the Russian Armed Forces plan to “make passage” into the region — in Moldova’s East, bordering Ukraine and less than 30 miles from the port city of Odessa — to create a “land corridor to Crimea,” Russian media reported. Such a corridor would also purport to connect the Russian mainland to Transnistria. Minnekayev stated that the measure was part of Russia’s second phase in its war in Ukraine, which involves establishing full control over the Donbas Region and Ukraine’s coast along the Black Sea. No timeline was provided for the maneuver to begin, however. In his remarks, Minnekayev cited the strategic value of the region, claiming “control over the south of Ukraine is another exit into Transnistria, where there are also facts pointing to the oppression of the Russian-speaking population.” Transnistria is a separatist region of Moldova — comprised primarily of Russian speakers — akin to Donetsk and Luhansk in Ukraine, which has been autonomously run by a pro-Russian faction since 1990. It is not internationally recognized by any country, including Russia, though nearly 1,500 Russian troops are stationed in the region and its trade is primarily conducted with the Russian mainland. Ukraine’s armed forces had previously warned on April 2 that Russia was mobilizing troops in Transnistria, though this was initially denied by Moldova. Ukraine believes that such mobilization is a prelude to attacks on Odessa, Ukraine’s largest port city and a gateway for its international trade. Russia’s occupation of Transnistria would expand the conflict with Ukraine to another European nation-state, since it began in late February of 2022. More ominously, in his remarks, Minnekayev said that Russia was now “at war with the whole world, as it [was] in the Great Patriotic War.” Ukrainian Peace Negotiators, Russian Oligarch Victims of Suspected Poisoning: Report Scenes of Devastation and Resolve from the Russian Invasion of Kyiv At Least 50 Civilians Dead in Russian Missile Strike on Ukrainian Train Station",World/National Review,Russian General Announces Plan to Invade Moldova after Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-general-announces-plan-invade-142124312.html
4/24/2022,"TOKYO (Reuters) - An experimental treatment from Shionogi & Co Ltd has shown rapid clearance of the virus that causes COVID-19, according to new data, the Japanese drug maker said on Sunday. The pill, S-217622, ""demonstrated rapid clearance of the infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus"", Shionogi said in a statement, citing Phase-2b results from the Phase II/III clinical trial of the drug. The company has global aspirations for the antiviral pill, which is now being evaluated by Japanese regulators. The findings released on Sunday also showed ""there was no significant difference in total score of 12 COVID-19 symptoms between treatment arms"" although the drug showed improvement in a composite score of five ""respiratory and feverish"" symptoms, Shionogi said. The drugmaker said in March it would launch a global Phase III trial worldwide for the drug with U.S. government support, and Chief Executive Isao Teshirogi has said production could reach 10 million doses a year. Shionogi's shares have been on a rollercoaster on speculation about success of the treatment. The stock climbed on Friday after a report the U.S. government is in talks to acquire supplies of the drug. On April 13 the stock sank by as much as 16% on reports the drug could pose risks to pregnancies, based on preclinical data.

4/24/2022,"Donald Trump railed against America's low water pressure during his rally in Ohio on Saturday. The former president claimed that Americans are unable to properly wash their dishes or use the bathroom. Environmental advocates criticized Trump-era moves to relax limits on water and energy use as being wasteful. Former President Donald Trump dedicated a portion of his rambling 90-minute speech at a rally in Delaware, Ohio, to dishwashers, washing machines, and bathrooms. The former president has long taken issue with America's water pressure and claimed that Americans could not properly wash their dishes or use the bathroom. —Acyn (@Acyn) April 23, 2022 ""In the dishwashers as an example, they had a little problem. What was the problem? They didn't give you any water. And it was so little water that you couldn't wash the dishes. So what did people do? They kept pressing. Do it again, do it again, do it again. So by the time you do it ten times, the dishes are finally there,"" Trump said, during his rally speech on Saturday. He boasted that he introduced a regulation to let Americans ""have all the damn water you want for your dishes."" Trump referred to rules he introduced as president that exempted quick dishwashers, washing machines, and dryers from efficiency regulations, which President Joe Biden reversed in January. Environmental advocates had criticized Trump's move to relax limits on water and energy use as being wasteful. During the Ohio rally, Trump complained about low water pressure in taps and showers and claimed that he could not properly wash his hair when he stayed at new hotels. ""The water just drips out a little bit slowly. I want to take good care of my hair. I don't want that. No, it's true. I mean, I put the soap, and it takes you 20 minutes to have the water come out to get the damn soap out of your hair,"" Trump said. He also claimed that the water problem extends to the ""third element of a bathroom"" and suggested that people flush up to ten times for it to work. At the rally, Trump claimed that Democrats are trying to ""destroy our country"" with the ""climate hoax"" and boasted about his decision to make the US withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2017– a move that Biden reversed.  The former president has a long history of going against the scientific consensus to question whether climate change is real.  The Biden administration has moved to reverse several Trump-era policies that Trump's critics say were harmful to the environment.

4/24/2022,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — At home, two-term Republican Sen. John Boozman is known as an unassuming figure who talks almost in a whisper and is more comfortable chatting about policy or the University of Arkansas Razorbacks' football record than giving fiery speeches. But you wouldn't know that if you turned on the television lately. “John Boozman has always stood up to the gun-grabbing liberals of Washington,"" a local sheriff says in one Boozman ad. In another, fellow Republican Sen. Tom Cotton hails Boozman as “our conservative fighter."" Boozman promises to finish building the wall along the U.S. border with Mexico that Donald Trump promised. The sharper tone is Boozman's effort to deal with an awkward problem as he seeks reelection in a Republican stronghold that Trump won overwhelmingly two years ago: Conservative voters are restive with Trump out of power, and GOP candidates are expected to sound bristling mad about it. Boozman said the ads are not inconsistent with his low-key style and that he is just focusing on concerns he is hearing from voters. “These are the things that are on people's minds, so what we're trying to do is address those issues and help them understand we're at the forefront of working hard to get something done,"" Boozman said. “I'm not an individual that screams and hollers. I'm an individual that gets to work and gets results."" But ferocity just does not come naturally to Boozman. His more combative friends are rallying to help with that. “He doesn’t draw attention to himself,"" Republican strategist Bill Vickery said of the 71-year-old eye doctor and former Razorbacks football player. “He sort of lets his record speak for himself."" In GOP-led states, even Republicans with seemingly safe seats are trying to ward off any perceptions they are insufficiently loyal to the former president. Such concerns already led Trump to withdraw his endorsement of Mo Brooks in Alabama's Senate race, and have driven him to back an effort to unseat Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in that state's primary. Boozman has received Trump's endorsement along with the backing of top Republican figures in Arkansas. That includes Sarah Sanders, the party’s likely nominee for governor who was as Trump’s press secretary. Boozman also has been endorsed by the National Rifle Association and National Right to Life. His chief rival in the May 24 primary is Jake Bequette, a former NFL and Razorbacks player who served in the Army and has appeared frequently on Fox News. Bequette's fundraising has paled in comparison to Boozman's, but he is backed by a super political action committee supported by shipping executive Richard Uihlein. “I think in this political environment, the people of Arkansas and America First patriots around the country, they want conservative warriors,” Bequette said. Boozman's other GOP challengers include Jan Morgan, a former TV reporter and conservative activist who has appeared at the state Capitol frequently to push for bans on vaccine mandates and for looser gun laws. Both have regularly assailed Boozman as a RINO — Republican In Name Only — even though the incumbent voted more than 91% of the time with Trump, according to the website FiveThirtyEight. Boozman has voted with President Joe Biden 34% of the time, according to FiveThirtyEight's tally, and his challengers say that is too often. One of the main areas of attack is Boozman's decision to not challenge Biden's victory in the 2020 election, despite Trump's lies that the election was stolen. Boozman's rivals have also criticized the senator for saying Trump bore “some responsibility"" for the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol. Boozman voted to acquit Trump during impeachment proceedings. Boozman said he does not think Trump bears direct responsibility for the riot, and he has called the House committee investigating Jan. 6 a “partisan charade.” Boozman said he remains committed to Trump and would support him for president in 2024. “I do know if he was president now, we would be in a much better position than having President Biden,"" Boozman said. With hardly any public polling available, there are few signs indicating trouble for Boozman. The incumbent has been outraising his rivals and blanketing the state with ads, including the one featuring Cotton, a potential White House candidate in 2024. Two super PACs supporting Boozman have recently begun airing TV ads. Boozman has focused on farming and veterans issues during his time in the Senate, topics that do not lend themselves to viral videos or incendiary speeches but are crucial in this predominantly rural state. He is in line to lead the powerful Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee should the GOP win control of the Senate this fall. Boozman compared his approach to that of the football coaches he said influenced him the most in school. “They didn't just scream and holler. They put game plans in place and worked toward a common goal to get things done versus just screaming about it,"" Boozman said.",Politics/Associated Press,Ads from soft-spoken Arkansas Sen.
