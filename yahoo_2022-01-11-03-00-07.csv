1/11/2022,"After a tearful apology for her actions, a Kansas woman was sentenced Monday to two years’ probation and 60 hours of community service for her role in the Capitol riot. Esther Schwemmer, of Leavenworth, also must pay $500 in restitution for damage to the Capitol building, which prosecutors say totaled $1.5 million. The sentence was handed down via video conference in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. “I’m deeply ashamed of my actions on that day,” Schwemmer told U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich, her voice breaking. “Nothing about it was Christ-like…I hope with time I can forgive myself.” Friedrich told Schwemmer that “none of us are defined by the worst mistake we made.” “So I hope you can forgive yourself,” Friedrich said. “I do appreciate your, what I think is genuine remorse here.” Friedrich added, however, that though the crime Schwemmer pleaded guilty to is a misdemeanor, “it is nonetheless a serious offense.” “Miss Schwemmer was part of the large, violent crowd that reached the U.S. Capitol just over a year ago… And despite what she said at the time of the offense, her actions were in no way an act of patriotism, nor was it an exercise of her First Amendment rights,” Friedrich said. “She was clearly trespassing, she had no right to be there, and her actions indirectly subjected law enforcement officers whose job it is to protect the Capitol and members of Congress and others who were inside the Capitol to great risk.” Friedrich noted that from the outset, Schwemmer had acknowledged her conduct, cooperated with the FBI and worked to resolve her case. Schwemmer also has devoted her life to her family, her job and to volunteer activities, the judge said. “She’s done a lot of service work through her church, she ran a local church soup kitchen ministering to the poor, she’s invested in the youth and she’s performed years of faith-based ministry,” Friedrich said. Schwemmer faced a maximum sentence of six months in prison, five years’ probation and a $5,000 fine. Prosecutors had requested a sentence of 30 days’ home detention as part of a three-year term of probation, 60 hours of community service, and $500 in restitution. Schwemmer, 56, and her friend Jennifer Ruth Parks, 61, traveled to Washington, D.C., together to attend the pro-Trump “Stop the Steal” rally before following the crowd to the Capitol, court documents said. They were initially charged with four misdemeanors — entering and remaining in a restricted building; disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building; violent entry and disorderly conduct in a Capitol building; and parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building. Both pleaded guilty to a single “parading” charge. The government dropped the other charges in exchange for their guilty pleas. Parks, of Leavenworth, was sentenced Dec. 8 to two years’ probation, 60 hours of community service and $500 in restitution. The women were among eight Kansas residents charged for their alleged roles in the Capitol riot. Mark Rebegila of St. Marys pleaded guilty to a single misdemeanor count on Dec. 1 and is scheduled to be sentenced in March. The cases of the other five defendants — three Proud Boys from Johnson County, a Wichita man and a Topeka man — are winding their way through the courts. Schwemmer’s and Parks’ involvement in the Capitol breach came to light when the FBI received a tip on Jan. 11, 2021, saying Parks had participated in the “DC mob.” The FBI interviewed both women on Jan. 17, according to court documents. Schwemmer told authorities that she and Parks were eating while they watched people running toward the Capitol building. Schwemmer said the two followed the crowd to another area outside the Capitol and eventually heard people suggest going to the front of the building “to conduct peaceful protesting.” “Schwemmer claimed that she and Parks walked to the front of the Capitol Building, encountered no barricades and no police officer told them to stop,” the court document said. “Schwemmer saw the open doors to the U.S. Capitol Building and entered with Parks.” She told agents they went upstairs and that police were allowing them to walk around. But she said that as soon as a police officer told them to leave, they did. Schwemmer gave agents a photo of her and Parks taken outside the Capitol building, court records showed. In the photo, she was wrapped in a “Trump 2020” flag and wore a Make America Great Again beanie cap. In a letter to the judge, Schwemmer apologized to the Capitol Police and members and employees of Congress “for what they must have endured on that day and its lasting impact.” “I regret the loss of life, the fear members of Congress must have felt, and law enforcement working that day,” she wrote. “While I did not personally damage any property or injure anyone, I realize my presence that day added to the chaos that caused death, physical injury and emotional distress to others. Your honor, I can promise you that you will never see me committing another offense for the rest of my life.” Schwemmer — a longtime hairstylist who retired in 2019 — said she is “an honest hardworking American” who came to the U.S. from Germany at age 24. Her husband is an Army veteran. “I have accepted this country as mine and assimilated into our society,” she said. “I made a stupid choice on 6 January walking in the Capitol. That choice I will carry for the rest of my life.” She said she had spent 28 years in America “with only a single speeding ticket 20 years ago and I can promise you that there is zero chance of recidivism.” “I wish only to disappear into obscurity for the remainder of my years,” she said. “I’m determined to stay away from politics and work on trying to make amends for my conduct on January 6. I am deeply sorry that what started out as an act of patriotism on my part ended up so wrong.”",U.S./Kansas City Star,‘Deeply ashamed.’ Kansas woman sentenced for role in Capitol riot after tearful apology,https://news.yahoo.com/deeply-ashamed-kansas-woman-sentenced-165932253.html

1/11/2022,"While monuments like the Statue of Liberty and the ancient Egyptian sphinx tower over people, they’re far from the tallest ones in the world. In a new size comparison video YouTuber and animator Real Data offers a look which statues are indeed the tallest in existence. And they grow so huge it feels like they could guard the Gates of Argonath. Real Data recently posted the above statue size comparison to their YouTube channel. Real Data, like MetaBallStudios, focuses on random yet fascinating size comparisons. Previously, for example, the animator has compared the sizes of the world’s largest arenas. As well the tallest monsters from fictional worlds. In this comparison Real Data says their aim was to answer the question: Which of the world’s statues is tallest? This question led to the lineup, which consists of a couple dozen statues; beginning with the Statue of David standing at a very respectable 17 feet tall. Although, of course, quite a measly height in this company. After the Statue of David, the lineup proceeds through statues such as the iconic Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (124 feet tall) and The Great Buddha in Thailand (301 feet tall). And each time a new statue is added, it’s hard to imagine how the next one will dwarf it. The monuments begin to grow absurdly tall after the Statue of Liberty, with the likes of the statue of Laykyun Sekkya in Myanmar (377 feet tall) and the Spring Temple Buddha in Henan, China (419 feet tall). As for the tallest statue in the world? That honor belongs to the Statue of Unity in Gujarat, India. That statue, which is in the image immediately above, stands at an astounding 574 feet tall. Or about one tenth as tall as a statue dedicated to Bender Bending Rodriguez would need to be in order to please him.

 The Supreme Court on Monday issued a revised transcript of oral arguments over a Biden administration vaccine rule that clarified a statement Justice Neil Gorsuch made about the number of annual flu deaths. The original, uncorrected transcript quotes Gorsuch as saying he believes the flu kills ""hundreds of thousands of people every year."" This erroneous transcription prompted legions of tweets and at least one media report that tut-tutted Gorsuch and pointed out the actual number of annual flu deaths, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate, is between 12,000 and 52,000 - well below the hundreds of thousands the conservative justice purportedly cited. On Monday, however, the Supreme Court's press office issued a corrected transcript showing that Gorsuch actually said he believes the flu kills ""hundreds, thousands of people every year."" Below is the corrected quote in full, which occurred during a colloquy with a government attorney over the vaccine rule promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA): ""We have vaccines against that - that, but the federal government through OSHA, so far as I know, and you can correct me, does not mandate every worker in the country to receive such a vaccine. We have flu vaccines. The flu kills, I believe, hundreds, thousands of people every year. OSHA has never purported to regulate on that basis."" Gorsuch and fellow conservative justices appeared skeptical during last week's arguments over the Biden administration rule, which imposes a COVID-19 vaccine-or-test requirement on employers with 100 or more workers. A ruling in the case, National Federation of Independent Business v. Department of Labor, is expected soon.",Politics/The Hill,Supreme Court issues revised transcript of Gorsuch remark about flu deaths,https://news.yahoo.com/supreme-court-issues-revised-transcript-162312822.html

1/11/2022,"New York City Mayor Eric Adams responded to a critique from AOC on his ""low skill workers"" comments. Adams said service industry workers ""don't have the academic skills to sit in the corner office."" AOC later countered that these jobs do require skill, and Adams said she's playing ""word police."" Just over a week since taking office, New York City Mayor Eric Adams escalated a back-and-forth with one of the city's most prominent Democrats. In an interview with The New York Times published Tuesday, Adams accused Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of playing ""word police"" and that he ""can only aspire one day to be as perfect"" as she is. It started with an Adams press conference last week where he implored white collar employers to send their workers back to the office and with more frequency. ""My low-skill workers, my cooks, my dishwashers, my messengers, my shoe shine people, those that work in Dunkin' Donuts, they don't have the academic skills to sit in the corner office,"" Adams said. ""They need this."" Ocasio-Cortez, a Queens Democrat, responded by disputing Adams via Twitter. —Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) January 5, 2022 ""The suggestion that any job is 'low skill' is a myth perpetuated by wealthy interests to justify inhumane working conditions, little/no healthcare, and low wages,"" AOC tweeted. ""Plus being a waitress has made me and many others *better* at our jobs than those who've never known that life."" The mayor made an addendum to his earlier comments a few hours after AOC tweeted her critique, qualifying what he said with his own experience in the food service sector. ""I was a cook. I was a dishwasher. If nobody came to my restaurant when I was in college, I wouldn't have been able to survive,"" Adams tweeted. ""When you talk about closing down our city, you're talking about putting low-wage workers out of a job. I'm not letting that happen."" Adams earlier referred to the congresswoman as ""words police"" in a CNBC interview last Thursday, but went into more detail during his Times interview. ""I would rather be authentic and make errors than be robotic and not be sincere in what they're doing,"" he said. ""I know they're perfect, and there's not much I can do about that,"" he added, referring to AOC. ""I can only aspire one day to be as perfect as they are."" The new mayor did leave the door open to collaboration with the high profile lawmaker down the line, but not before letting in one final dig.

1/11/2022,"ROME (AP) — Pope Francis took the first step Monday to reorganize the Vatican’s powerful doctrine office, removing the No. 2 official widely believed responsible for a controversial document barring blessings for same-sex couples because God “cannot bless sin.” Francis named Archbishop Giacomo Morandi, currently the secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, bishop of the Italian diocese of Reggio Emilia-Guastalla. The move amounts to a demotion since Morandi currently has the title of archbishop, yet is heading to a small diocese, not an archdiocese. The Vatican said Morandi would nevertheless retain the title of archbishop “ad personam.” The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, or CDF, is one of the most important Vatican offices, interpreting doctrine for the universal Catholic Church, sanctioning dissenters and handling cases of clergy sexual abuse of minors. Morandi joined the CDF as an under-secretary in 2015 and was promoted to secretary, or the No. 2, in 2017. He was widely seen as being behind the March 2021 document that outraged the gay community, which Francis has made pains to welcome into the church fold. The document declared that the Catholic Church won’t bless same-sex unions because God “cannot bless sin.” The document said Francis had been informed of the document and “gave his assent” to its publication, but Francis was apparently taken by surprise by its impact. Francis has since made several gestures of outreach to the gay Catholic community and their advocates, including a recent letter congratulating an American nun once sanctioned by the CDF, Sister Jeannine Gramick, on her 50 years of LGBTQ ministry. The CDF is currently headed by the Jesuit Cardinal Luis Ladaria, but he is expected to retire relatively soon since he turns 78 in April, three years beyond the normal retirement age for bishops. Aside from Morandi, there are two “additional secretaries” in the CDF, including the American Archbishop Joseph Di Noia, who also is due to retire soon since he turns 79 in July. The other is Archbishop Charles Scicluna, but he has a full-time job as archbishop of Malta. The impending retirements and transfer of Morandi thus suggests some management changes at the office, though they probably won’t be announced until Francis releases the blueprint of his reform of the Vatican’s overall bureaucracy, expected sometime this year.",World/Associated Press,Pope moves to reorganize Vatican doctrine office,https://news.yahoo.com/pope-moves-reorganize-vatican-doctrine-164735983.html

Since she’s focused more on maintaining her weight these days vs losing it, she’s loosened up her diet a little more while still adding healthy food to her staple meals. Rebel Wilson’s self-proclaimed year of health may be over, but she’s clearly still all about taking her fitness seriously. The 41-year-old Pitch Perfect alum just dropped a pic on Instagram that shows she’s not slouching on her workout game. In the pic, a super toned-looking Rebel is working a gorgeous teal sports bra and matching leggings while bending over and giving the camera serious face. Her arms, abs, and legs look super strong, and she looks hella determined. “Rebel Rising 😉 #2022,” she wrote in the caption. People cheered her on in the comments. “My inspiration! I lost 50lbs in 2021 and hope to lose 50 more this year!! 👏👏” one person wrote. “You… look….inspiring …🔥🔥🔥,” another said. ICYMI: Rebel went on a serious journey to lose 77 pounds in 2020, completely overhauling her diet and exercise routine in the process. Rebel started out by avoiding junk food and sugar, and eventually followed an eating plan called the Mayr Method, which focuses on eliminating snacking, reducing your gluten and dairy intake, and being mindful about what you put in your mouth. Go-to foods include veggies, fresh fish, and sheep’s milk yogurt. Rebel also started working out with trainer Jono Castano up to seven days a week, regularly dropping fitspo content on Instagram of herself doing impressive moves like flipping tires, stair sprints, and battle ropes. Rebel also made a point to walk regularly. “I got all these high-tech tests done on me during my year of health,"" she told People. ""They said that walking was actually the best way for me to lose unnecessary body fat."" Of course, 2020 was a while ago, but Rebel has still been working hard to stay in shape. She told Women’s Health that she’s really focused on her past with emotional eating. “The biggest lesson I’ve learned is how to deal with my emotional eating, learning to process my emotions and deal with my emotions better,"" she said. ""That’s what's really changed my life for the better.” Since she’s focused more on maintaining her weight these days vs losing it, she’s loosened up her diet a little more while still adding healthy food to her staple meals. A prime example: She’ll add shredded carrots and avocados to tacos. (Note to self: Try that.) On the workout front, Rebel says she’s segued into a more comfortable routine for her. ""I don’t have to do such extreme workouts,” she said. “It's really about enjoying exercise and physical activity, so I will just go on a light walk.

1/11/2022,"ALMA, Colo. (AP) — Two people snowshoeing in the mountains of Colorado were killed in an avalanche over the weekend, authorities said. Their bodies and the body of their dog were found buried near Hoosier Pass in central Colorado by searchers using an avalanche rescue dog, the Colorado Avalanche Information Center said Sunday. The search started after the snowshoers failed to return from an outing on Saturday.

The snowshoers were not identified and the avalanche was the second fatal slide this winter in Colorado.
