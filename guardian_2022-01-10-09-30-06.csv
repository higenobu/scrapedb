1/10/2022,"A dog called Beyoncé, a Roland drum kit, a 1940s typewriter and a suitcase full of Blackpool rock were among the items left behind by people who stayed at Travelodge hotels last year. Other items that guests forgot to take home with them included a DJI Phantom drone, six-foot feathered angel wings, a coin collection that was started nine decades ago and a Jimmy Choo Cinderella shoe.  Staff at Travelodge’s 582 hotels reported a significant increase in holiday items being left behind over the last year. The suitcase of rock was found at the firm’s South Promenade venue in Blackpool, a dress made out of postcards was left in Bournemouth and housekeepers at the Rhyl Seafront hotel in north Wales discovered a huge inflatable unicorn pool float on the bed of room 13. A Pomsky dog called Beyoncé was left behind at Manchester Central, and the owner of a miniature horse called Red Rum was said to be beside herself when she got home and realised that she had forgotten her horsebox in the Cockermouth hotel car park. Brides, grooms and wedding guests left behind a number of items, including an Islamic marriage certificate and a wedding cake piñata. A bridesmaid staying at the Liverpool Exchange Street hotel left behind the bride’s pet lovebirds, Will and Kate, which she was supposed to take to the ceremony. Among other items left behind were: A smart robot dog A first edition of Watership Down A banana boat A GT V8 Bentley convertible An Angora rabbit called Thumper A wedding proposal message in a bottle An ice-cream cart A telescope A birth chart and tarot reading Travelodge’s communications director, Shakila Ahmed, said: “In 2021, following freedom day, we welcomed back millions of customers to our 582 UK Travelodge hotels and we saw a significant increase in bookings. This has led to a range of interesting items being left behind by our customers across our UK hotels. “When it comes to why so many of our customers forget their treasured items, it’s basically due to us all being time poor, juggling multiple tasks and being in a hurry to get from A to B. In the rush, valuable possessions are easily forgotten.”",News/Business,From dogs to drones: the items Travelodge guests left behind in 2021,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/10/from-dogs-to-drones-the-items-travelodge-guests-left-behind-in-2021
1/10/2022,"Manufacturers have warned that Brexit will add to soaring costs facing British industry, amid concerns that customs delays and red tape will rank among the biggest challenges for firms this year. Make UK, the industry body representing 20,000 manufacturing firms of all sizes from across the country, said that while optimism among its members had grown, it was being undermined by the after-effects of the UK’s departure from the EU.  One year on from the end of the transition period, two-thirds of industrial company leaders in its survey of 228 firms said Brexit had moderately or significantly hampered their business. More than half of firms warned they were likely to suffer further damage this year from customs delays due to import checks and changes to product labelling. According to the 2022 MakeUK/PwC senior executive survey, Brexit disruption remains among the biggest concerns facing industry bosses for the year ahead as Britain’s departure from the EU complicates the fallout from Covid-19 and the rising costs facing companies. Delays at customs, the additional costs from meeting separate regulatory regimes in the UK and the EU, and reduced access to migrant workers were among top concerns raised in the survey. “It is clear from these figures that Brexit and the global Covid-19 pandemic have had a scarring effect on the mentality of many businesses, which are traumatised by the ongoing delays and disruptions to their supply chains,” the report said. The warning came as other research showed Britain’s economy was losing steam at the end of last year as the Omicron variant hit demand for goods and services. According to analysis of leading business surveys by BDO, an accountancy firm, and the Centre for Economics and Business Research, business optimism and output growth fell in December as firms grappled with the fallout from the latest wave of Covid infections. A separate survey by IHS Markit and NatWest found that activity dropped in 11 out of 12 regions of the UK, with a marked loss in momentum in London, and the north-east slipping into contraction. Kaley Crossthwaite, a partner at accountants BDO, said: “Ongoing uncertainty around Omicron is providing a further blow to UK businesses which have already battled a string of supply chain issues, the threat of furtherCovid restrictions and inflationary pressures this past year.” Despite concerns over the impact of Brexit and the Omicron variant, Make UK and PwC said that three-quarters of companies in its senior executive survey expected conditions in manufacturing to improve over the coming year. Almost three-quarters of companies said they believed conditions for the sector would improve, with about 73% believing that opportunities outweighed the risks. That optimism tallied with a separate survey of chief financial officers of large companies by Deloitte, another accountancy firm. The latest quarterly survey showed that a record 37% were planning on increasing capital investment in the next year. More of the companies were considering expansion into new products, services, or markets than at any time since it began in 2009. The Deloitte poll showed that the financial executives believed that Brexit would be a significant negative for UK-EU trade and migration. Although finding that confidence was tempered by the impact of Brexit, Covid-19 and rising costs, the Make UK survey showed two-thirds of companies regarded the UK as a competitive location for manufacturing. Around a third of companies in the survey were also looking to “reshore” their supply chains to rely more on domestic sources following severe disruption to the delivery of international components and materials. Make UK said that despite the challenges in the short term, the shift could represent the “possible death of the just-in-time supply chain business model”. “[That] may be a good thing for British manufacturers, who are now developing ways to ensure they are more resilient and less exposed to unforeseen international risks in future,” it added.",News/Business,"Brexit changes will add to soaring costs in 2022, warn UK manufacturers",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/10/brexit-changes-will-add-to-soaring-costs-in-2022-warn-uk-manufacturers
1/10/2022,"Fortnum & Mason is launching a competition to find a dish celebrating the Queen’s 70 years on the throne, marking the beginning of official jubilee festivities. Much like Poulet Reine Elizabeth, more commonly known as coronation chicken, invented by Le Cordon Bleu London for the Queen’s coronation banquet in 1953, it is hoped the Platinum Pudding competition will serve as a long-lasting reminder of the 95 year-old monarch’s reign.  Recipes will be judged by an expert panel including the queen of British baking herself, Dame Mary Berry. Other programmes unveiled by Buckingham Palace on Monday include the Queen opening her private estates to the public and a concert outside the palace. The Queen usually spends the anniversary of her accession privately at Sandringham. It is not clear which events she will attend or take part in following orders to rest by doctors in October last year and an overnight hospital stay for unspecified preliminary investigations. The bulk of the jubilee duties are expected to be given to the rest of the royal family, including the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall. From 12 to 15 May, more than 500 horses and 1,000 performers are expected to take part in a show in the grounds of Windsor Castle, which will take the audience through history from Elizabeth I to the present day.More ceremonies are to take place later in the year, starting on Thursday 2 June, the first day of the special four-day bank holiday, when the Queen’s birthday parade, Trooping the Colour, will take place in Horse Guards Parade. On the same day, the UK, Channel Islands, Isle of Man and UK Overseas Territories will come together to light a beacon at the same time as the principal beacon at Buckingham Palace. On Friday 3 June, which will be a bank holiday, a service of thanksgiving for the Queen’s reign will be held at St Paul’s Cathedral, before what’s billed to be a star-studded Platinum Party at the Palace on the Saturday. Performers are yet to be named but it’s said to be bringing together some of the world’s biggest names in entertainment. People across the country will sit down together for the Big Jubilee Lunch on 5 June. Sandringham and Balmoral will also be open for residents and visitors to enjoy the celebrations across the long weekend. Performers, dancers, musicians, military personnel, key workers and volunteers will tell the story of the Queen’s reign in the Platinum Jubilee Pageant, which will form a River of Hope – devised of 200 silk flags – making its way along the Mall. Schoolchildren have also been invited to create a picture of their hopes for the planet over the next 70 years, and some of their designs will be put on to the flags. From July, three displays marking the Queen’s accession to the throne, the coronation and jubilees will be put on at the official royal residences.",News/UK news,Platinum pudding for Queen’s jubilee to follow 1953’s coronation chicken ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/10/platinum-pudding-for-queens-jubilee-to-follow-1953s-coronation-chicken
1/10/2022,"Grab a piece of fruit and a beverage of your preference and settle in for Five Great Reads: your morning tea wrap of great writing, curiosity and usefulness, lovingly selected by me – Alyx Gorman, Guardian Australia’s lifestyle editor (cold brew and blueberries, in case you’re wondering). If you’d rather be reading the news as it unfolds, hop over to our live blog; and if you just want a quick hit of something other than Covid, read about this badger that discovered a trove of 209 Roman coins in Spain.  Now, on to the rest of the reads. Four leading American authors – SA Cosby, Richard Ford, Margo Jefferson and Joyce Carol Oates – share their thoughts on Biden’s leadership through 12 months of political polarisation and the pandemic. Notable quote: “The other day, someone was talking about the DW Winnicott idea of the good enough mother,” writes Pulitzer-prize winning critic and author Margo Jefferson. “She’s not a saint, she has her own problems, but she’s good enough for the child to grow up reasonably well. With Joe Biden, it’s a case of the good enough president.” How long will it take me to read? About 10 minutes. Well, OK they’re not really sentient, but they’re smart. AI-powered shops in the UK, Scandinavia and the US could spell the end of the grocery store as we know it. The bit that’s good for you: You never have to queue again. The bit that’s good for the supermarket: These stores have no shoplifting (and very few staff). The bit that’s a Black Mirror episode: All this is achieved by thousands of cameras tracking shoppers’ every move, and sending the bill to their phone as they walk out. How long will it take me to read? About five minutes. Roblox – a platform which allows people to not only play games, but build and make money from them – is the most valuable video game company in the world. “It is an empire built on the sale of virtual boots and hats,” Simon Parkins writes. “And considering that almost half of its users are aged 13 or under, the creativity and labour of children.” Notable quote: “It began to have a negative effect on my mental health,” says Regan Green, who spent two years working as a developer on a Sonic the Hedgehog Roblox game. “I was constantly trying to find ways to improve the project, but [the game’s creator] always wanted more out of me and I became incredibly burned out.” Yeah, but everyone is burning out at the moment. Did I mention that he was working on the game between the ages of 12 and 14? Oh. Then: “The pressure caused me to break.” The A Little Life author’s new book To Paradise – a work of alternative history that spans three centuries – has already been called “as good as War and Peace” (by fellow author Edmund White). Here Yanagihara talks about the book and the American ideals it explores and critiques. Yanagihara on writing very big books, while holding down a very fancy job (as editor of T Magazine): “I’m not the smartest or hardest-working or most educated person, but I am the best at time management.” I guess I need to get better at time management then. Same. So how long will it take me to read this? Five well-managed minutes. The latest in our How to Move series tackles fitness with a difficult ticker.

1/10/2022,"The Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has tested positive for Covid-19.  In a statement on Sunday evening, the office of the New York progressive said she was “experiencing symptoms and recovering at home. “The congresswoman received her booster shot this fall and encourages everyone to get their booster and follow all Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance”. New York is experiencing a huge surge of Covid cases linked to the Omicron variant, placing strain on hospitals and public health resources. The city has posted high rates of vaccination. Earlier, in an interview on Fox News Sunday, the director of the CDC, Rochelle Walensky, was asked about the severity of the Omicron variant compared to the Delta variant. Walensky said: “We are starting to see data from other countries that indicate on a person-by-person basis it may not be. However, given the volume of cases that we’re seeing with Omicron we very well may see death rates rise dramatically.” According to Johns Hopkins University, more than 837,000 people have died of Covid-19 in the US. Around two-thirds of the eligible population is considered fully vaccinated but resistance to public health measures stoked by conservative politicians and media has dogged the federal response. Walensky also emphasised the importance of vaccination and booster shots, saying: “We have seen with the Omicron variant that prior infection protects you less well than it had … with prior variants. “Right now, I think the most important thing to do is to protect Americans. We do that by getting them vaccinated and getting them boosted.”",News/US news,Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez announces positive Covid test,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/09/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-positive-covid-test-omicron-new-york
