5/16/2022,"‘We made nearly half a million kids happy with a cardboard box,” says set designer Sam Wilde. “Even if that just lasted 15 minutes, that’s something I will always be proud of.” In the lockdown of spring 2020, Wilde and director Ian Nicholson created homemade online productions of Jon Klassen’s trilogy of subversive children’s picture books, starting with I Want My Hat Back, in which a ponderous bear searches for his missing pointy red hat. The trilogy went viral and is now transferring – with bigger puppets, new actors and a good deal more cardboard – to the Little Angel theatre in London. “The first show cost £16,” says Wilde. “And that was just postage!” “I can’t stress how tiny everything was,” says Nicholson, who performed and directed the shows kneeling behind his kitchen table. The set of the first one just about fits into a shoebox, and was made from what Wilde had to hand. A bike shop that had opened down the road was throwing out cardboard boxes; the bear’s eyes were beads swiped from one of his daughter’s necklaces. Wilde is Zooming from his home in Bristol while Nicholson dials in from the rehearsal room, a library in Portsmouth. Unable to meet during lockdown, the pair would plan everything online. Then Wilde would make the set and puppets and post them to Nicholson, who would put everything together and film, with his now wife, Susannah Stevenson – whom they both credit as the real hero of the project – acting as stage manager. Each of the online shows was filmed in one dramatic take – a decision born out of necessity. “I don’t know how to edit,” Nicholson admits. The first one, eight minutes long, took six hours to film. They never expected the shows to go viral. “I was convinced the only people to watch it would be my kids,” Wilde says. The morning it went online, 1,000 viewers watched live. The total online audience for the trilogy would be equivalent to selling out the Little Angel for a year and a half. For their hilarious mischief, lack of morals and embrace of casual brutality, Klassen’s books are popular with parents as well as kids. “I often think of it as the Psycho of children’s books,” says Wilde seriously. “It’s all shifty eyes and knowing looks. That’s quintessentially Jon Klassen. It’s all about hiding the action.” Nicholson’s raised eyebrows and sideways smirks do just as much for the story as the tortoise, snake or frog – all of whom swear they haven’t seen the bear’s hat. During the pandemic, children from around the world made their own versions of the puppets. Some even recreated the full productions and uploaded them, giving the animals the same accents that Nicholson did. “I remember getting an email about this little boy who hadn’t wanted to go out after lockdown,” says Wilde. “His parents made him a bear, and they took the bear out around their town looking for the hat.” For more than a decade, this bulbous bear has been central to the pair’s work and friendship. They met when Nicholson was workshopping a different performance of I Want My Hat Back. Wilde’s involvement was based – rather appropriately, for this book – on a lie. “I was working as the world’s worst director,” he confesses, “and I wasn’t making any money. A friend of ours was doing the music for this and he’d told the director that he knew an incredible designer.” Wilde had grown up crafting – his dad was a children’s therapist with a focus on art – so the actual design wasn’t a problem. He just couldn’t let on that he hadn’t ever done it in a professional capacity. That version of the show never made it to the stage; the rights were snapped up for what became the 2015 production at the National in London. Until the pandemic, they had pretty much forgotten about it. “On the first proper day of lockdown,” Nicholson says, “Sam and I thought, ‘Shall we just make a show?’” They got in touch with Klassen on Twitter, who told them to go for it. A child who watched the digital show when they were three would now be five: “Your life is enormously bigger,” says Nicholson, who has married and had a child since. The show has grown too – the new puppets seem ginormous. “This is fox,” Nicholson says, bringing out a beautiful, sleek puppet bigger than his head. “He was an inch and a half for the digital show.” Bear, who was five inches, is now more than two feet tall. They’ve brought in two actors – one of whom will job-share with Nicholson so he can manage childcare – and the performers get to stand, rather than kneel. “Hopefully it’ll still have that same feeling of the video,” Nicholson says, “of being handmade and something you could do at home.” They’re going to sneak in little surprises and Wilde will give online workshops on how to make a variety of hats, in the hope audiences might wear them to the performances. It would be a brave child who put on a pointy red one. I hear a bear is on the lookout for a thief.

5/16/2022,"Erik ten Hag has backed Marc Overmars to make a “romantic return” to Ajax after the former Netherlands international resigned as the club’s director of football for sending inappropriate messages to female colleagues. Ten Hag began as Manchester United’s manager on an informal basis on Monday after guiding Ajax to the Eredivisie title. Overmars left the Dutch club in February, stating he was “ashamed” at his behaviour and apologising. Ten Hag believes Overmars could one day work again at Ajax – in tandem with him. “That’s a romantic thought,” the 51-year-old told De Telegraaf. “We’ve have been very successful together. It’s hard to say it’s happening, but it certainly could.” Regarding Overmars’ conduct Ten Hag said: “It is a social problem, because you see it everywhere: in politics and in business. If Johan Derksen can go back …” Derksen, 73, is a former footballer and now pundit who said on live television in April that he had assaulted a woman 50 years before with a candle. The next day Derksen sought to backtrack on his statement, saying the object had only been placed close to her legs. At the time of Overmars’ resignation Ajax’s supervisory board chair, Leen Meijaard, said: “It is devastating for the women who have had to deal with the behaviour. When we heard news of this, we immediately acted, carefully deliberating and weighing what was the best thing to do, all in consultation with CEO Edwin van der Sar and assisted by an external expert.” Ten Hag credited Overmars with the championships. “That’s one of the statements I made after winning the title,” he said. “We modelled this team together. I also texted Marc that.” In March the Belgian side Royal Antwerp appointed Overmars as their technical director. “What has happened at Ajax won’t happen again,” he said. “I am glad to be here. It is a new chapter for me.”",Sport/Football,Ten Hag backs Overmars for Ajax return after exit over ‘inappropriate messages’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/16/erik-ten-hag-marc-overmars-ajax-return-inappropriate-messages
5/16/2022,"The Moscow city government will take over a factory belonging to the French carmaker Renault and use it to revive the Soviet-era Moskvitch in Russia’s first major nationalisation of a foreign company during its war in Ukraine. The development, which Russians who remember the Moskvitch as a clunker ridiculed, is part of a wave of western companies such as McDonald’s and Siemens leaving the Russian market as the war in Ukraine nears its fourth month. Renault has ceded its 68% stake in Russia’s biggest carmaker AvtoVAZ with an option to buy it back within six years. According to media reports, the company’s Russian assets were sold for one rouble, meaning the city of Moscow has effectively taken control of the factory free. Renault’s CEO, Luca de Meo, said in statement that the company was protecting its future business in Russia. “Today we have taken a difficult but necessary decision, and we are making a responsible choice towards our 45,000 employees in Russia while preserving the group’s performance and our ability to return to the country in the future.” Hawkish commentators such as the head of Russia Today, Margarita Simonyan, have said foreign companies that leave the Russian market should have their local assets seized. Moscow’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, appeared to defend Renault’s decision and said the city would take over the factory to prevent unemployment. “The foreign owner decided to close the Moscow Renault plant,” said Sobyanin. “This is its right, but we cannot allow thousands of workers to be left without work. Therefore, I decided to take the plant under control of the city and resume the production of passenger cars under the historical Moskvitch brand. We will try to keep most of the team working directly at the plant and its associates.” For Russians who have joked about the country’s return to Soviet isolation, the revival of the Moskvitch was the perfect punchline. “Russia has invented a time machine,” wrote one. “It can move the whole country through time, but only back into the Soviet Union.” The satirical website Panorama predicted the revival of the Moskvitch a month ago when it wrote a fake headline that the Renault factory had “assembled its first Moskvitch in 20 years”. “Panorama does not make predictions, we report exclusively on real news from the future,” it wrote on Monday after the deal was announced. McDonald’s announced on Monday that it would be leaving the Russian market and selling its 850 locations to a local buyer. “The humanitarian crisis caused by the war in Ukraine, and the precipitating unpredictable operating environment, have led McDonald’s to conclude that continued ownership of the business in Russia is no longer tenable,” the company said. The opening of the first McDonald’s on Moscow’s Pushkinskaya Square in 1990 was a major event. More than 30,000 Soviet citizens formed a queue kilometres long to sample the burgers, fries and soft drinks. Russian state news agencies said the stores would reopen by mid-June. “McDonald’s will return to Russia in June under a new brand,” Tass cited a source as saying. “The restaurant chain and menu will be preserved, as will the jobs. More than 90% of suppliers are Russian, cooperation with them will continue. In fact, only the name will go.”",News/World news,Russia to take over Renault’s Moscow factory to revive Soviet-era car,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/russia-renault-moscow-factory-revive-soviet-era-moskvitch-car
5/16/2022,"Children’s home providers in England should not be able to profit from caring for society’s most vulnerable children, the new head of the Association of Directors of Children’s Services (ADCS) has said. Steve Crocker criticised private providers driving around in sports cars and buying racehorses with their profits after “getting rich off taxpayers’ money”. Profit margins for the 15 largest private children’s home operators average 22.6%, according to the Competition and Markets Authority. Most councils in England have at least one looked-after child whose private placement costs £10,000 a week or more, with costs running to £60,000 a week in the most extreme cases. Yet in Scotland, which has moved much closer towards a not-for-profit children’s care system, costs are generally lower. “There should be a national approach to management and profits,” said Crocker, calling for a national cap on fees in England. “We have long had the aspiration to make the sector not-for-profit – Scotland, which has had that aspiration for longer, has got nearer to it.” The wealth of some at the top of some children’s care companies can be conspicuous. Blaklion, a horse that raced in the Grand National last month, is owned by a former children’s home chain boss and property developer, Darren Yates. He bought the animal in 2019 for £300,000 after selling his Sandcastle Care chain to a private equity firm. The business became part of Aspris, which said the acquisition would result in it having annual revenues of more than £200m. Earlier this year the Guardian exposed Robert McGuinness, the owner of a “squalid” children’s home in Bolton, who drove around in a Lamborghini and spent large amounts of company money running a bar in York and on his own social life. The children’s home was shut down. A solicitor for McGuinness’s company said at the time that the expenses were legitimate. Asked if the profits mattered if the homes were good, Crocker said: “It does matter because the profits that they’re making and what they’re getting rich off is taxpayers money. We should expect good value for money for public expenditure.” Crocker, a former residential care worker and social worker who is in charge of children’s services at Hampshire council, said some providers were making large profits by cherrypicking the easiest children, with some maintaining their good Ofsted ratings by refusing to take children with the most complex needs. He added: “One of the ways in which providers can ensure that they have a good or outstanding rating is that they basically get the pick of the children. In any one day they might get referrals for 10 children and they will choose, perhaps understandably, the children that are likely to be less challenging. The ones that haven’t got substance misuse problems, the ones that aren’t gang affiliated, who haven’t got significant convictions for violence etc etc.” The result, he added, was a “two-tier system” where there was a severe shortage of homes for “really tricky kids”. Many local authorities who sold off their children’s homes in the past 30 years amid a series of abuse scandals were now trying to buy or build new ones to save money in the long-term, said Crocker. Many of these homes were just for one child – “because often we find that when we put them with other children the problems really multiply”. Despite some government funding available to build homes, councils still struggled after 11 years of austerity cuts and the ever increasing cost of crisis placements, he said. Children’s services departments were spending most of their budgets on a small number of children in care, said Crocker. As a result they cannot afford to expand the early intervention work that stops problems escalating. “We would really want to invest much more heavily in early health and prevention and family services. That’s got to be the way forward,” he said, adding that the ADCS “really really hopes” such measures are in the forthcoming independent review of children’s social care. He also wants to see children’s homes jointly funded by child and adolescent mental health (CAMHS) services to offer therapeutic work to deal with behaviour problems Crocker said the current system usually managed to keep children safe but did not do enough to “heal” damaged children. “Generally speaking, the English child protection system is one of the safer in the world,” he said. “But I think I’d argue that although it might be safer, I’m not sure we do enough yet to heal trauma of children.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “All children and young people deserve to grow up in a stable, loving home, and no private company should exploit those in need of placement. “We commissioned an independent review of children’s social care, which will recommend reforms to the system, and are working hard to raise standards for children in care while it continues.”",News/Society,Private children’s home bosses in England criticised over huge profits,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/16/private-children-home-bosses-iengland-criticised-huge-profits
5/16/2022,"A new government white paper on UK aid has been condemned as a “double whammy to the world’s poor”. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office’s (FCDO) first strategy paper on overseas assistance since the merged department was formed and large-scale cuts were implemented in 2020, is dominated by a near halving of UK aid to multilateral bodies, including the UN the World Bank, and a renewed focus on aid as an adjunct to trade. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, claimed that reliable private sector investments will challenge “malign actors” and bring countries into the orbit of free market economies, a clear reference to the challenge posed by China’s large aid programme. “In an increasingly geopolitical world, we must use development as a key part of our foreign policy. Malign actors treat economics and development as a means of control, using patronage, investment and debt as a form of economic coercion and political power. We won’t mirror their malign tactics, but we will match them in our resolve to provide an alternative,” said Truss. The 20-page development paper, which is devoid of many specific budget allocations, sets out the high-level goal of cutting the proportion of UK aid going to multilateral bodies from 40% of the budget to 25% by 2025. The UK aid budget has been cut by £4bn since 2020. Critics will claim the move reduces the UK’s influence within these bodies at a critical time, and that Britain can never, on its own, hope to match Chinese bilateral aid. More than 100 countries have signed up to China’s “belt and road” infrastructure programmes. At the G7 in Cornwall last year, the UK pledged to work with the US administration on a western alternative to Chinese aid, but little reference is made to this plan in the paper. Sarah Champion, chair of the Commons international development committee, said: “The foreign secretary’s strategy has two main thrusts. It advocates aid for trade – linking the provision of aid to access for UK goods and services. And it says more of our money should go on direct government-to-government spending rather than spending through international bodies such as the United Nations. “I fear that adds up to a double whammy against the global poor.” She added: “Supporting the poorest in the world should not be conditional on a trade deal or agreeing to investment partnerships. The UK has rightly been hugely critical of China for such an approach, so I fail to see why we are following down the same road. It is depressing and disappointing that the UK would devise a strategy like this,” she said. The paper places a new emphasis on women and girls, but says the budget to cover education, empowerment, sexual and reproductive health and rights and ending violence will only be restored to levels reached at the end of 2021. Aid groups had hoped funding would be restored to 2020 levels, before the government aid cuts started to bite. The UK has already cut £1.5bn from a World Bank programme to help poor countries recover from Covid. It remains the largest European donor to the bank, but has now fallen behind the US and Japan. Other priorities set out in the white paper are climate finance and humanitarian aid, which is set at £3bn over the next three years. The paper says Africa remains a priority for the UK since “geostrategic competition in Africa will intensify over the next decade, and the impacts of Covid-19, climate change and biodiversity loss are increasing the vulnerability of many countries and their citizens”. A similar importance is attached to the Indo-Pacific, but the paper gives no country-specific funding allocations. The paper did not give a date for when the UK will return its overall aid budget to 0.7% of GNI. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has said he expects it won’t be before 2024-5. But the paper noted: “A return to 0.7% will allow us to scale up critical elements of our new strategy, including on climate and nature, as well as our ability to invest in countries.” In one of the few specific pledges in the white paper, the FCDO has promised to reduce the time it takes the department to approve a business case for programmes under £40m in value, to less than six weeks – currently it can take months.",News/Global development,UK’s new aid strategy condemned as ‘double whammy to world’s poor’,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/may/16/uk-aid-strategy-liz-truss-double-whammy-world-poor
5/16/2022,"A bellwether election in Germany’s most populous state has shown a further eroding of support for populist parties on the far ends of the political spectrum, thrown up questions over the pulling power of the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and entrenched the growing authority of the Greens. The centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) of the incumbent state premier, Hendrik Wüst, emerged as the strongest party on the night in North Rhine-Westphalia, with 35.7% of the vote, while the Social Democratic party (SPD) came second with its worst postwar result in the former stronghold state in the industrial west. With the liberal Free Democratic party (FDP) halving its vote and the Green party gaining 11.8 percentage points to emerge as kingmaker for the influential state’s next coalition government, a power-sharing agreement between the conservative and ecological parties is the most likely outcome. Electoral trends in North Rhine-Westphalia mirrored those the previous weekend in Germany’s northernmost state, Schleswig-Holstein, where the CDU and Greens also managed to score significant gains and are expected to continue governing in a three-way coalition with the FDP. Here too, the SPD achieved its worst result of the postwar era, with only 16% of the vote. In a marked contrast to the recent French election showing the far right and far left increasing in strength, both German state polls accentuated an erosion of support for the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) and the leftwing Die Linke. The AfD saw losses of two percentage points in North Rhine-Westphalia and dropped below the 5% electoral threshold in Schleswig-Holstein, while the left party will be represented in neither state parliaments. Accusations of appeasing Putin may have been a contributory factor: the parliamentary groups of the AfD and Die Linke were the only ones to vote against sending heavy weapons to Ukraine in the Bundestag at the end of April. The struggles of the two parties, whose positions are diametrically opposed on most issues other than Russia, predates the war in Ukraine, however. The AfD, which surged on to Germany’s political scene by promising a populist backlash after the eurozone crisis and an influx of Syrian refugees in 2015, has now suffered losses in the last eight consecutive state votes, including those in eastern parts of Germany such as Berlin, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Saxony-Anhalt. Die Linke, meanwhile, has looked rudderless after scraping into the federal parliament last September only thanks to a special provision for parties with at least three direct mandates. Internally divided between the noisily populist messaging of the prominent Sahra Wagenknecht and a more pragmatic but also less prolific faction, it has lost votes in seven elections in a row. The double blow for the Social Democrats, meanwhile, comes just over six months after Scholz and his party stormed to a triumphant photo finish at national elections, in which the taciturn northerner managed to successfully offer himself up as a leader in the calm, pragmatic mould of the outgoing chancellor Angela Merkel. Russia’s war in Ukraine, however, has turned some of Scholz’s selling points into negatives, as commentators accuse him of failing to adequately explain his position on weapons exports or energy embargoes. “Scholz is trapped in the role of the crisis chancellor,” wrote the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper on Monday. “For weeks the war in Ukraine has almost completely overshadowed all other issues.” “Scholz’s hesitant course on delivering heavy weapons to Ukraine is being interpreted by a section of society as weak leadership, while others consider it prudent.” As Scholz has looked hamstrung by an internal SPD debate on the failures of its historical policy of economic rapprochement with Russia, the Greens of the foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, and the economic minister, Robert Habeck, who have managed to communicate their positions more convincingly. “The way Habeck and Baerbock are ushering the country through these times of war appears to convince people,” wrote Der Spiegel, “with clear words, emotion and the odd admission that they too struggle with actions demanded of them”. In Germany’s federalised political system, not every vote at state level can be interpreted as a verdict on the conduct of the national government. A month into the Ukraine war, the SPD also managed to score an absolute majority in the small state of Saarland, a rarity in contemporary Germany.",News/World news,German state elections show populism in decline on left and right,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/german-state-elections-populism-decline-north-rhine-westphalia
5/16/2022,"The growth prospects for the EU have been revised sharply downwards after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine put paid to hopes of a strong and sustained recovery from Covid-19 over the next two years. Rocketing energy prices as a result of the conflict have pushed up inflation and increased economic headwinds during a period when they were expected to subside, the European Commission said in its latest forecasts. The commission now expects 2022 growth of 2.7% in the 19-nation euro area and the broader 27-country EU – down from a forecast of 4% three months ago. But it said a complete cut in supplies of Russian gas would shave a further 2.5 points off growth – bringing the economy to a virtual standstill this year. With many European countries heavily dependent on Russian energy exports, growth is expected to slow further next year – to 2.3% in the EU and the euro area. Inflation, already at its highest in the euro area since the creation of the single currency more than two decades ago, is expected to average 6.1% this year, up from 3.5% in the last set of commission predictions in February. EU-wide inflation is expected to average 6.8%. Inflation would average close to 10% in the event of a Russian gas ban, the commission said. “The outlook for the EU economy before the outbreak of the war was for a prolonged and robust expansion. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has posed new challenges, just as the Uunion had recovered from the economic impacts of the pandemic,” it said in a statement. The fastest growing countries in the EU this year are expected to be Portugal, at 5.8%, and Ireland (5.4%), with Estonia (1%), Germany and Finland (both 1.6%) forecast to be the weakest. Valdis Dombrovskis, an EU trade commissioner, said: “There is no doubt that the EU economy is going through a challenging period due to Russia’s war against Ukraine, and we have downgraded our forecast accordingly. “The overwhelming negative factor is the surge in energy prices, driving inflation to record highs and putting a strain on European businesses and households. While growth will continue this year and next, it will be much more subdued than previously expected. Uncertainty and risks to the outlook will remain high as long as Russia’s aggression continues.” News of the gloomier outlook for the EU came in after signs of a rapid slowing in the world’s second biggest economy, China. Analysts had pencilled in an annual decline in retail sales of 6% in April as a result of lockdowns and falling consumer confidence but official figures showed the fall was almost twice as big at just over 11%. The closure of factories meant industrial production fell by 2.9% year on year in April – the biggest fall since the early months of the pandemic in 2020. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate – a closely watched indicator by the Chinese authorities – rose from 5.8% to 6.1%. Iris Pang, an analyst at ING, said she expected China’s gross domestic product – a measure of its growth rate – to be 1% lower in the second quarter of 2022 than a year earlier. “The main reason is the long lockdown in Shanghai,” Pang said. “This hurt retail sales the most, and also those factories that do not have ‘closed-loop operation’; if they don’t have dormitories for workers, they struggle to operate.”",News/World news,EU growth forecast cut as war in Ukraine fuels inflation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/eu-growth-forecast-cut-inflation-ukraine-war-please
5/16/2022,"London is “desperate” for commuters to return and needs to keep investing to lure them back, its mayor, Sadiq Khan, has said as he reopened the Northern line via Bank station, a key connection into the City. Khan said the reopening was another milestone on the road to recovery after Covid. The underground branch had been closed for 17 weeks to build a new tunnel, track and concourse to alleviate congestion in the station, a key interchange for tube lines and the Docklands Light Railway. The commissioner for Transport for London, Andy Byford, said it had been completed “on time and on budget” – a critical point for TfL as it seeks to negotiate long-term capital funding for investment from the government. The full £700m Bank upgrade project, encompassing six years of work on the station and including better connections, accessible lifts, and a new station entrance, will be completed later this year. Khan said the reopening of “one of the most complicated stations in the world” was “another example of investment in public transport paying dividends, that will lead to an improved experience for commuters – we’re desperate to get people back to the office. “This is crucial. If you’ve been working from home for the last two years, we’ve got to make the offer of returning to the office – the journey – enticing.” TfL’s current emergency funding deal from central government, the latest £200m instalment after fare revenue dried up during Covid-19 lockdowns, will expire in six weeks, and the mayor hit out at ministers over the short-term “begging bowl” handouts to the capital. Khan said: “It’s ridiculous. It’s no way to run public transport in a global city like London. Our ability to do long-term deals, to get value for money, is being hindered by the government playing party politics with London. “We can’t stand still. We desperately need people back – but the government has got to understand we’ve got to carry on investing in the future. You will not get a national recovery without a London recovery – you don’t level up a country successfully by making London poorer, it’s not a zero-sum game.” Bank and the interconnected Monument station were used by 120 million people a year before the pandemic. Shravan Joshi, of the City of London Corporation, said the reopening of the Northern line’s City branch, connecting dozens of stations south and north in the capital directly to Bank again, was “fantastic news for the Square Mile as our sustainable recovery from the pandemic continues”. Passenger numbers at City stations such as Bank have lagged behind the general recovery, at 55%-60% of 2019 levels, but are significantly up from about 33% in January. Overall, midweek tube ridership has risen to about 70% of pre-pandemic levels, and almost 3m journeys were made last Thursday, the highest since the start of the pandemic. Weekend and leisure trips, even before the mass return of international tourists, have reached about 85% of pre-pandemic levels. The trend towards working from home is continuing to hit businesses in city centres, in the capital and elsewhere in the country. On Monday the bakery chain Greggs revealed that while its sales were growing, those at city centre locations catering to office workers were lagging behind those elsewhere. Byford said he was confident that midweek passenger numbers would rise higher soon, thanks to the opening of the Elizabeth line next week as well as the return of international tourists. Standing in what was until January the cramped Northern southbound tunnel and platform, built more than 100 years ago, but is now a spacious concourse for passengers, he said: “It’s been amazing to see the customers’ reactions – some think they have got off at the wrong station.” One passenger who definitely knew where they were was Kevin Koosaletse, 47, a construction firm director from Hertfordshire, who had rerouted to see the redevelopment: “It’s lots better than it used to be – I’m blown away, it’s very airy, beautiful.”",News/UK news,Sadiq Khan: London must invest to lure commuters after Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/16/sadiq-khan-london-covid-bank-branch-northern-line
5/16/2022,"It was all under control. Hertha had their gameplan and found Borussia Dortmund snoozing passively in the early afternoon sun, agreeably enough, seemingly more focused on farewells to the long-serving Michael Zorc and Marcel Schmelzer, not to mention Premier League-bound Erling Haaland. Ishak Belfodil rattled in a first-half penalty and it was as comfortable as Felix Magath could have hoped for in his most warm, fuzzy daydream. What happened next was Hertha 101, a tour de force in sweaty palms and perhaps even sweatier minds. Dortmund were revived from their slumber, certainly, and the half-time introduction of the lively Jamie Bynoe-Gittens, the 17-year-old who is already muscling his way into being a regular in this column, put some pep in Schwarzgelben steps, but Magath’s afternoon was familiar in turning from enjoyable idyll to nightmare flashback. Hertha “missed the third match point in a row,” as Kicker’s Steffen Rohr put it – after the concession of a late equaliser at Arminia Bielefeld and shipping a late winner to Mainz last Saturday had denied Hertha successive results which would have assured salvation, they were at it again here. “We had it well under control defensively until the penalty,” bemoaned Fredi Bobic on Doppelpass on Sunday, and Haaland’s levelling spot kick and a sharply struck winner by Youssoufa Moukoko (whose own possible farewell would be a more worrisome one for BVB in the medium term) in front of the Yellow Wall won the match. It was a goal elsewhere, however, that finally condemned Hertha to the purgatory of the relegation playoff. 📽️ THE MOMENT @VfB_INT SECURED THEIR LEAGUE STATUS IN THE 90+2ND MINUTE! 🤯🤯🤯 pic.twitter.com/XQJpDf7dFM Of three goals scored in added time on the final day of the Bundesliga that meant something, none was more resonant than Wataru Endo’s for Stuttgart at home to Köln. Hertha had gone from comfortable to nervy to near-desolate at a speed dizzying even by their standards of unexpected (and perhaps unnecessary) drama. The captain’s goal, nodded in at the back post in front of the Cannstatter Kurve – and just in front of goalkeeper Florian Müller, pushed forward as the desperate home side threw the kitchen sink at it – sparked delirium on and off the pitch. The final day needed a Hertha loss and a Stuttgart win for the Berliners to replace the 2007 champions in the playoff place and thanks to Endo’s late nod of the head, that’s exactly what it got. So instead of Magath spending Sunday boxing his things in his office and quietly congratulating himself on an emergency job well done, the coach and his assistant Mark Fotheringham were off scouting potential playoff opponents. It was Fotheringham, in the end, who ended up watching the opposition, as Hamburg’s 3-2 win at Hansa Rostock set them up for what will be the biggest playoff in recent memory – against a club with whom Magath has a historic link. “I’ve come to terms with the result,” Magath reflected. “I think we played a very good game and stood up to the German runners-up for more than 90 minutes. We’ve proved that we’re a top-flight team. Now we have to do it twice more.” The experienced Magath says believing in his players is one thing. Them believing in themselves is something quite different. He’s right – they don’t look like relegation fodder since he took charge and even if the club needs restructuring “from top to bottom” (as Magath himself put it this week) they have played well enough to survive. The problem is that they’ve dropped the ball just when it counted. For Stuttgart it was maybe even harder to take in. After defeat at Hoffenheim in late February, conceding two goals in the final five minutes to transform a win into a loss, they looked finished. Reaching the playoff at that point would have been considered a major victory. The club’s and sporting director Sven Mislintat’s determination to keep faith in coach Pellegrino Materazzo when some around were losing theirs has been vindicated in emphatic fashion. “I don’t even remember what happened,” Materazzo told Sky of the moment when he charged down the touchline and joined the jubilant bundle of his players in the corner in the aftermath of Endo’s winner. “I’ve got a headache from all the screaming. I don’t even know who scored the goal.” The coach started to come to “with Fritzle lying on top of me”, he said of the club’s crocodile mascot. Sasa Kalajdzic, the fragile jewel in Stuttgart’s crown who opened the scoring, is always a beacon at over two metres tall. Here, he stood out representing the confusion, relief and joy of his club, firstly wandering around the field for confirmation at the final whistle that yes, Hertha had indeed lost, and then sitting alone and tearful on the bench while his teammates were lost in the thousands of celebrating pitch invaders. Stuttgart will be delighted to have been spared particularly as their last playoff involvement, in 2019, saw them relegated by Union Berlin. Hertha will hope to avoid a similar fate, after a weekend in which Union joyously celebrated Europa League qualification and finished an astonishing 24 points ahead of them. Whatever the result of the playoff, it will have a seismic impact on German football. Arminia Bielefeld 1-1 RB Leipzig, Augsburg 2-1 Greuther Fürth, Dortmund 2-1 Hertha Berlin, Leverkusen 2-1 Freiburg, Boeussia M'gladbach 5-1 Hoffenheim, Mainz 2-2 Eintracht Frankfurt, Stuttgart 2-1 Cologne, Union Berlin 3-2 VfL Bochum, Wolfsburg 2-2 Bayern  Saturday was about celebration for Bayern Munich – or should have been, but as has become tradition, subtext fills the void left by a lack of jeopardy. The burgeoning Robert Lewandowski saga did the job after the 2-2 draw at Wolfsburg, in which the Poland striker scored a 35th Bundesliga goal of the season. After a week in which multiple reports claimed Lewandowski had agreed a three-year deal with Barcelona, Bayern made a clear they are in no mood to facilitate an exit. “He knew in Dortmund a year beforehand that he was going to Bayern Munich and had an outstanding season back then,” said honorary president Uli Hoeness. “That’s why I’m 100% sure that Robert will play very well for us next year.”  Leipzig were tardy in sealing their Champions League place, with a(nother) stoppage-time goal from Willi Orban bagging the required point at doomed Arminia Bielefeld at a point where a Freiburg winner at already home-and-hosed Leverkusen would have allowed Christian Streich’s team to leap above them and into the top four. “The last 10 minutes weren’t easy,” said Emil Forsberg. “We were following what was happening at Leverkusen on our phones [on the bench]”. Orban’s goal plus Exequiel Palacios’a 97th-minute winner for Leverkusen, struck from the centre circle with goalkeeper Mark Flekken out of his goal in a throw-everything-at-it punt for the winner, edged Domenico Tedesco’s side home, though Freiburg celebrated their Europa League qualification in the dressing room despite their defeat, as well they might. They reconvene with Leipzig in Berlin next Saturday with the DfB Pokal, which will be a first major trophy for either of these two clubs from very different backgrounds, at stake.  After last season’s mass coaching changes in the league, similar moves are afoot already, with Adi Hütter and Markus Weinzierl announcing their departures from Borussia Mönchengladbach and Augsburg respectively in their post-match conferences (the latter catching managing director Stefan Reuter, who was unaware, on the hop), while Wolfsburg confirmed the exit of Florian Kohfeldt on Sunday morning.",Sport/Football,Stuttgart steal survival to plunge Hertha into a relegation battle royale | Andy Brassell ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/16/stuttgart-steal-survival-to-plunge-hertha-into-a-relegation-battle-royale

5/16/2022,"In the United States, fights are raging over cultural issues: constant coverage of “cancel culture”, pitched battles over teaching “critical race theory” (CRT) in classrooms or the definition of the term “woman”. For years, many on the left have argued that such battles were “distractions” from the real fight over class and economic issues. They are only half right. These supposed sham battles are simply the most recent moments in a loosely organized cultural rightwing insurgency. The Federalist Society has been incubating rightwing legal careers since the 1980s. The fight against critical race theory continues a longstanding rightwing offensive against public education, whose roots go back as far as the backlash to racially integrated schooling. It’s right to note, as detractors of the “culture wars” have, that something is dishonest about these battles. The details have always been squishy in the particulars: defending constitutional analysis of the “original intent” of the slaveowners of yesteryear has long been difficult to take seriously on the intellectual merits. The standard bearers of the opposition to critical race theory have had a tough time saying what it even is that they oppose, and Florida textbook reviewers assigned with rooting out CRT from math textbooks didn’t fare much better. But this vagueness on the side of justification is paired with a frightening clarity of tactical purpose on the side of action. Florida legislators may have a problem articulating the reasons for banning the books, but they have banned 40% of math books anyway. Meanwhile, Alabama and Texas have criminalized care for trans youth. Perhaps most dramatically, the recent leak from the supreme court suggests that the court may strike down Roe v Wade, a critical blow against the bodily autonomy of women, trans men and non-binary people with uteruses (even more legislation aiming at uncomplicating this sentence will surely be forthcoming). It couldn’t be clearer, then, that the view of “culture wars” as purely distractions from “real”political struggle is seriously mistaken. The idea that concrete, “material” issues ought to mean a narrow focus on jobs and the economy – and not, say, uteruses – seems hard to justify. Even the most hard-nosed materialist, ought to notice that decisions about school curricula determine whose values are listened to, and whose aren’t. That is, in even the most realpolitik of terms, the struggle being waged has real-world effects on redistribution of social and political power. And that redistribution is shifting power in the direction of the least honest, most bigoted and most authoritarian social forces on the political right. In one sense, the reduction of politics to “culture wars” has never made less sense. The material stakes of the climate crisis is that it threatens regular heatwaves like the one that south Asia is still reeling from. Meanwhile, state conflict is taking a worrying turn: Russia and Ukraine are fighting a great power war between states, the Ethiopia and Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front navigate an uneasy ceasefire in a civil war, and Mozambique is contending with a wave of Islamic State militants. These aren’t problems that can be solved by clarifying the content of math textbooks or being clear about who uses which bathrooms. But from another vantage point, focusing on “culture” makes perfect sense. After all, it’s not simply that global ruling class lacks answers in the United States and elsewhere. The situation is even more dire: the ruling class lacks questions. The dramatic shift in state response to the Covid-19 pandemic after mass vaccination evidences that elites believe their interests are so far removed from living conditions for the rest of us that they simply lose interest as soon as they feel their own security is assured. This also makes sense of policymakers’ tepid action on the climate crisis, the national and global housing crisis, and selective empathy for refugees and immigrants in general. You’re cordially invited to participate vigorously in the project of harassing school board officials, but leave the big war and climate stuff to the idle experts. Addressing these crises would involve redistributing political and economic power away from the present powers that be, and offering people concrete solutions rather than outlets for rage and self-expression. The answer from on high is clear: no redistribution, just fighting over culture and “vibes”. That’s why an entire cottage industry spanning from YouTube to outrage radio to legacy media has arisen to play off our most legitimate grievances with others, our most petty jealousies and bigotries, and everything in between. Many of these are suspiciously well resourced and funded, and few of them pose any serious challenge to the profit, property and social position of the people who actually hold most of the cards in our political contests. These astroturfed political battles are simply the latest page of the oldest playbook, where the 1% attempts to divide the rest in pursuit of private profit and social domination. We shouldn’t abandon the culture wars, but we shouldn’t take the bait either. Instead, we should build a political culture built around mutual goals that address concrete problems head on – a constructive politics organized around what we want to build for ourselves and our children instead of who we resent. Many such campaigns are alive and well. Across the country, groups are fighting to guarantee reproductive justice. Tenants’ organizations in Kansas City and Los Angeles are making their presence and power felt at eviction hearings and state legislatures, and campaigners for reparations for African-American descendants of the enslaved have moved millions of dollars in Evanston. And a wave of unionizations at Starbucks and Amazon may signal a resurgence of organized labor. As demonstrated by unions in Illinois, West Virginia and Minnesota, these organizations have the power to advance not only wages and working conditions for their members, but also the common good of entire communities. And, unlike the vibes offered in the culture war, those are things you can eat.
