3/12/2022,"By Karen Lema MANILA (Reuters) - When Philippine Catholic priest Father Nap Baltazar raised his hands to bless the people attending mass, the sleeves on his white vestment slid back to reveal a pink bracelet inscribed with the words ""Let Leni Lead"". Baltazar, 47, belongs to a group of like-minded priests in Asia's biggest Catholic nation who have abandoned their neutrality to oppose the presidential bid of Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the late dictator's son and namesake, and openly endorse his closest rival Leni Robredo, whose team colour is pink. The presidential election is set for May 9, and latest opinion polls show Marcos, also known as ""Bongbong"", holds a double-digit lead over closest rival Robredo, while his running mate, Sara Duterte-Carpio, daughter of incumbent President Rodrigo Duterte, remained the top choice for the vice presidency. ""I will do everything I can to make sure he does not sit as president,"" Baltazar said of the 64-year old Marcos. The priest, who says he has never before campaigned publicly for a politician since being ordained, drives a van adorned with an image of Robredo and the words ""Pray and Choose Wisely. Your future depends on it"" written in pink. Back in 1986, the Catholic Church championed a ""People Power"" uprising that overthrew Marcos's father and drove his family to exile. But now, Marcos Jr, a former congressman and senator, appears poised to clinch the presidency, following a decades-long political fight back by a family accused of leading one of Asia's most notorious kleptocracies. The elder Marcos ruled for two decades, almost half of it under martial law during which thousands of his opponents were beaten and tortured, and disappeared or were killed. UNTHINKABLE Robredo, 56, narrowly defeated Marcos in the 2016 vice presidential contest. She is the leader of the opposition and the only female candidate in this year's presidential race. A former human rights lawyer, she has been a thorn in Duterte's side, questioning his war on drugs, his embrace of China and recently the handling of COVID-19. ""Leni happens to encapsulate the values of the Church and that is why I am not afraid to show my face and support her,"" said Father Edwin Gariguez, while meeting with people in his diocese in Calapan, south of the capital, in a pink mask and pink shirt promoting Robredo. The return of a Marcos to the country's seat of power is unthinkable for millions of Filipinos, including for Father John Era, who started the ""Pari, Madre, Misyonero Para Kay Leni (Priests, Nuns and Missionaries for Leni)"", hoping to use their ""influence"" to rally support behind her. Marcos has been campaigning on a promise to bring unity to the Philippines but is not entertaining questions about atrocities during his father's rule, which his critics say his family has neither apologised for, nor properly acknowledged. ""While presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos is calling for unity, we are saddened by the men and women of the Catholic clergy who are doing the exact opposite and have abused the pulpit, allowing it to become a platform for hateful and negative campaigning,"" his spokesman, Vic Rodriguez, said. ""As men and women of the cloth, they should be more circumspect, refrain from openly meddling with politics and stop making reckless imputations or statements that only serve as spiritual, moral, social and cultural poison,"" he added. The Catholic Church, which also participated in a popular movement in 2001 that led to the ouster of another president, Joseph Estrada, is at the Philippines' core. Four-fifths of the nation's over 110 million population are Catholics, and many still practice their faith with gusto. PARTISAN POLITICS Not everyone in the Church approves of the priests' actions, which have also drawn mixed reactions from Filipinos, who have taken to social media to either praise or decry the clergymen for taking political sides. Father Jerome Secillano, Public Affairs executive secretary at the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP), said the Church law forbids clergymen from engaging in partisan politics, and the role of the Church and clerics is ""only for education and formation of consciences."" Leaders of other religious groups in the Philippines, like the Kingdom of Jesus Christ and El Shaddai, which politicians have courted in the past because their members are known to follow their leaders' advice, have also come out to back Marcos's candidacy. And while Bishop Pablo Virgilio David, the president of CBCP, said the Church would not dictate who its members should vote for in the election, he has hinted which side he favours. During a mass on Feb. 8 at his diocese in Caloocan, he gave his blessing over the decision of its lay leaders to support Robredo. ""It is not right to be neutral when truth and the country's future are at stake,"" said David who was wearing a pink face mask. ""To be neutral means that you support evil.""

3/12/2022,"Images and video of a Russian armored train have surfaced on social media. The train is armed with anti-aircraft cannons and equipped with protective armor. Armies have used armored trains for more than a century. An armored train—once thought to be an anachronism on today’s battlefield—has turned up in Ukraine. The Russian military train, featuring steel armor and equipped with anti-aircraft guns, rolled into occupied Ukraine allegedly on a humanitarian mission. The use of armored trains goes back more than 100 years, to their use in the Boer War in Africa. The train was first spotted on February 7 in Melitopol, Ukraine, which is currently under Russian control. The train, according to the Russian military’s Zvezda News, is evacuating foreign citizens. (This claim, like any Russian government claim, should be taken with a grain of salt.) Russia has four armored trains: Baikal, Amur, Terek, and Don. It retired the trains after the conclusion of the Second Chechen War in the early 2000s, but returned them to service in 2015. According to unconfirmed reports, the train spotted in occupied Ukraine is a combination of both Baikal and Amur. Here’s a video from Russian state media of the two trains participating in military exercises in 2016:
 The trains are armed with two pairs of ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft guns. The ZU-23-2 is a twin-barreled 23-millimeter manually operated anti-aircraft gun. The ZU-23-2 is aimed with an old-fashioned peephole gunsight and lacks modern features such as night vision, stabilization, and laser range-finding. The guns are likely used to protect the train from aircraft as well as ambushes from the ground. In addition to the guns, the trains are also typically equipped with tanks and infantry fighting vehicles tied down to flatbed railcars for extra firepower. A Russian railroad car typically travels with one T-62 main battle tank and one BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicle. The T-62 is obsolete by today’s standards, but it provides a 115-millimeter main gun and machine guns in a heavily armored package. The BMP-2 adds a 30-millimeter auto-cannon and a Konkurs anti-tank guided missile. The trains are heavily armored, with steel plating covering the rail cars, though it’s unclear how thick the armor is. It’s likely enough to shrug off small arms fire and perhaps even 12.7-millimeter heavy machine gun fire. Additional protection is provided by electronic jamming devices designed to prevent remote-controlled bombs placed on the railroad tracks from detonating. Russia’s Ministry of Defence Railway Troops operate the train. The Railway Troops were originally established in 1851 to construct and maintain train tracks, and coordinate and protect the movement of trains across Russia. At 5,600 miles long, Russia relies heavily on trains for the movement of civilian and military goods. Russia used armored trains during the Russian Civil War, World War I, and World War II. Armored trains have always had a serious flaw: if the railroad tracks are disabled, the train can’t advance. It seems likely that Ukrainian guerrillas and armed drones with precision-guided weapons, such as the TB-2 Bayraktar, will target train tracks to prevent Russia from using them to support the war effort. If that happens, Russia’s armored train could become much like the rest of Russia’s mechanized invasion force: stuck in place, unable to go forward, and unable to retreat.

3/12/2022,"Jussie Smollett’s new mugshot has been released. The former “Empire” star was sentenced Thursday to 150 days in jail and 30 months’ probation for falsely reporting to police that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in 2019. He was also ordered to pay $120,106 in restitution to the city of Chicago and a $25,000 fine. Smollett was found guilty in December of five counts of felony disorderly conduct, though jurors concluded he was not guilty of the sixth count of aggravated battery. The charges stem from an elaborate hoax orchestrated by the 39-year-old actor and another two men the night of Jan. 29, 2019. Smollett, who is Black and gay, told authorities the men put a noose around his neck, splashed him with bleach and called him racist and homophobic slurs. Upon further investigation, police concluded Smollett hired two brothers to help him fake the attack. The brothers, later identified as Olabingo and Abimola Osundairo, were also arrested. They worked on the set of “Empire.” The pair were eventually released, and Smollett was arrested Feb. 21, 2019. Police said at the time that Smollett planned the phony incident to further his career Smollett, sporting a crisp white shirt and a short haircut, appears stone-faced and emotion-free in his new mugshot, taken after sentencing on Thursday. Cook County Circuit Judge James Linn ripped into Smollett during his sentencing hearing on Thursday, dubbing him a “charlatan pretending to be a victim of a hate crime.” The actor maintained his innocence in several outbursts and asserted that he would not harm himself behind bars. “I’m not suicidal,” he said. “If anything happens to me when I go in there, I did not do it to myself.” He served the first night of his sentence Thursday.",U.S./NY Daily News,Jussie Smollett’s mug shot released after he’s sentenced to jail for staging 2019 hate crime,https://news.yahoo.com/jussie-smollett-mug-shot-released-123800383.html
3/12/2022,"(Adds quotes, details) ANTALYA, Turkey, March 10 (Reuters) - Russia has presented proposals to Ukraine and wants a reply, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a briefing after talks with Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba in Turkey. Lavrov, speaking after the talks in Turkey, said Moscow wanted what he called a friendly, demilitarised Ukraine and reiterated a Russian demand that Ukraine should adopt neutral status. Kuleba said Russia was demanding Ukraine's surrender, two weeks after Russia began its invasion of the country. There was no discussion of a ceasefire and the talks had focused on humanitarian questions, Lavrov said. He said the venue for diplomacy should be Belarus, an ally of Moscow where Russian and Ukrainian officials have already held several rounds of talks. Russia did not want the talks in Turkey to ""replace or devalue the real, main diplomatic track which is happening on Belarusian territory"", Lavrov said. ""Today's conversation confirmed that there is no alternative to that track."" The talks in Belarus have so far yielded only limited progress on opening up humanitarian corridors. Lavrov said Russian President Vladimir Putin would not refuse a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy but it would have to be substantive and focus on specifics.
