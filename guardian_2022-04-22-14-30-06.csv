After that supernatural twist, Neve becomes intent on finding out what happened to her, taking advantage of her invisible state to get into places the police can’t go. Was her boyfriend what he seemed? Why can her little brother sense her presence? Episode one plants plenty of clues.

4/22/2022,"Along with daffodils and blossom, air pollution is a regular feature of spring in western Europe. Often these events are hard to notice in our everyday lives, but they have an impact on our health. For example, particle air pollution in spring 2014 was estimated to have resulted in 1,649 UK deaths. This year, the London mayor’s alerting service issued warnings on 23 March and air pollution was also mentioned in weather forecasts. Air pollution then reached the top of the UK government’s 10-point scale across London and the south-east. Other badly affected areas, with scores of eight and nine, included eastern areas of England and parts of the north-west. One starting point to control spring pollution is to understand what it is made of. For most of the last century, air pollution particles had to be collected on filters each day and it took weeks to do chemical analysis in laboratories. Now, three university-run air pollution “supersites” are conducting chemical analysis in real time. These are located in Manchester, Birmingham and London as part of the UK Clean Air Programme. Springtime pollution is often dominated by particles that contain ammonium. This comes from gases given off by the large amounts of fertiliser and manure that are used at this time of year, combined with pollution from industry and traffic. Carbon particles, both soot and more complex compounds of carbon and other elements, also add to the mix. Dr James Allan, from the University of Manchester, said: “Particle pollution was certainly high during March, but most of it (if not all) was made out of things like ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulphate and carbon compounds. The carbon-containing particles typically come from vehicle exhausts, wood burning, cooking and reactions between air pollution and sunlight. These are all things you would expect from pollution sources from within the UK and mainland Europe.” Dr David Green, from Imperial College London, said: “The highest concentrations were characterised by large contributions from traffic, industrial and agricultural sources. This was a more intense episode than we normally experience but the combination of pollution emissions, easterly winds and relatively low temperatures can result in these elevated concentrations.” Early data from Prof William Bloss, from the University of Birmingham, also shows the dominance of agriculture, traffic and industrial pollutants, along with particles from wood burning as well as tyre, brake and road wear. It is clear from the data that our air pollution laws need to encompass many more sources than they do at present.",News/Environment,Law must reflect dangers of spring brings increase in air pollution and ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/22/law-needs-to-protect-uk-from-spring-air-pollution-increase
4/22/2022,"Homebuyers are paying more for properties with heat pumps or other low-carbon technology installed, and are looking closely at energy ratings, according to analysis by the estate agents Savills. Energy-saving credentials are becoming important considerations for people who are looking to move and reduce soaring energy bills. Nearly six out of 10 (59%) prospective buyers told the company they were willing to pay more for a home primarily powered by renewable energy. Homes in England and Wales that have a heat pump fitted command a premium over average regional prices, Savills found. Meanwhile 71% of people surveyed said a home’s energy performance certificate (EPC) rating – which measures its energy performance – now played an important role in their considerations over whether to buy a property. Almost a third (32%) of people said they put more importance on EPC ratings than they did a year ago. “Faced with increasing energy prices, homes that offer more cost-efficient monthly alternatives – such as homes with heat pumps – are climbing higher up buyers’ wishlists when searching for a new home,” said Lawrence Bowles, residential research analyst at Savills. The vast majority of British homes still rely on fossil fuels for heating, hot water and cooking, accounting for more than a fifth of the UK’s carbon emissions, despite government emission reduction plans. At a time of spiralling energy bills, with further cost rises expected in the autumn, low-carbon alternatives are also viewed by some as a one way for households to lower their costs. Ministers want to ban gas boilers in new-build homes from 2025, and may extend the policy to include all new gas boilers from the mid-2030s onwards, after which date all newly installed heating systems would have to be low-carbon or be converted to use fuel such as hydrogen. The government is looking to electric heat pumps as an alternative – where warmth is extracted from the outside air, ground or water and concentrated before being transferred indoors. It has unveiled plans to offer £5,000 grants to allow people to install heat pumps and other low-carbon boiler replacements and set the target of installing 600,000 heat pumps a year by 2028. However, new technology is not necessarily cheap to install, and Savills found that homes that run on newer and cleaner energy tend to cost more, according to analysis of the average values of house transactions between 2019 and 2021. There are more homes that run on cleaner forms of heating in London and south-west England, while homes in the north-east are most reliant on mains gas: almost nine out of 10 properties are heated this way. The highest average prices are obtained by properties which use community heating schemes – where heat from a central source supplies more than one building or dwelling via a network, and can come from either a conventional boiler or a renewable energy-fired boiler. Homes with community heating schemes reach an average price over £550,000, according to Savills, while those with heat pumps have a slightly lower average value of £483,935. “In many areas housing values would not necessarily support the investment in newer and cleaner forms of heating,” Bowles said. “It also highlights the enormous challenge set by the zero-carbon agenda targets and the uphill battle ahead that we face.” He added that government subsidies would go some way to help people to lower their homes’ environmental footprint – including improving home insulation, or adding solar panels – but more resources and investment were needed to help reduce the UK’s reliance on fossil fuel heating. Just under half of homes in the countryside use oil for heating, creating a crisis for the rural communities who are dependent on oil deliveries. As a result, Savills said those hoping to buy in the countryside are increasingly looking for places with space to install a heat pump.",Lifestyle/Money,"Energy criteria high on UK homebuyer checklists, survey finds",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/22/energy-criteria-homebuyers-savills-survey
4/22/2022,"At the London premiere of The Northman in early April, the director, Robert Eggers, explained on stage how he was seeking to reclaim Viking history from rightwing groups. Many of these groups thrive on myths of an imagined European past: a time before racial mixing or progressive politics, when men were mighty warriors and women were compliant child-bearers. As Eggers told the Observer recently, such associations almost put him off making The Northman. “The macho stereotype of that history, along with, you know, the rightwing misappropriation of Viking culture, made me sort of allergic to it, and I just never wanted to go there.” Eggers has spoken of his scholarly research and commitment to getting Viking history right, down to the smallest details. But as rigorous and accomplished as The Northman is, it might in fact be the kind of movie the “alt-right” loves. The Northman’s 10th-century society appears to be uniformly white and firmly divided along patriarchal lines. Men do the ruling and killing; women do the scheming and baby-making. Its hero, played by Alexander Skarsgård, is not a million miles from the “macho stereotype” Eggers complained of – a brawny warrior who settles most disputes with a sword and without a shirt. Skarsgård’s love interest, played by Anya Taylor-Joy, could be the far-right male’s dream woman: beautiful, fair-haired, loyal to her man and committed to bearing his offspring. Even before the film’s release, far-right voices were giving their approval on the anonymous message board site 4chan: “Northman is a based [agreeable] movie, all white cast and shows pure raw masculinity.” “Robert Eggers. He is restoring pride in our people with his great films. The Northman is going to be epic… Hail Odin.” On the face of it, some images of Skarsgård in The Northman – bare-chested, pumped-up with battle rage, wearing a wolf’s pelt as headgear – are uncomfortably close to those of Jake Angeli, AKA the “QAnon Shaman”, the abiding mascot of the 6 January assault on the US Capitol. On that day in Washington, Angeli was similarly topless and animal-adorned, his torso bearing tattoos of Nordic symbols now associated with white-supremacist movements, including a stylised Mjölnir (Thor’s hammer), Ygdrasil (the “world tree” of Norse mythology) and the Valknut (an ancient symbol of interlocking triangles). The far right’s love of Nordic lore goes back to the Third Reich and beyond, – and the connection is stronger than ever. The deadly “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 was full of Nordic symbols on banners and shields. Anders Breivik, the Norwegian extremist who murdered 77 people in 2011, carved the names of Norse gods into his guns. The shooter at the 2019 massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand, drew Norse insignia on his possessions and wrote “see you in Valhalla” on his Facebook page. Eggers would doubtless be horrified to be associated with such movements, but The Northman illustrates how cinema can be misappropriated in ways its makers never intended. In the past two decades, the entire cultural landscape – and films about European history in particular – has been weaponised and politicised by the far right. A guide to the far-right mindset was created on Stormfront, the notorious white-nationalist site, in 2001. A contributor named Yggdrasil (there is that Norse mythology again) began a thread on “content that we can watch repeatedly”, laying out guidelines and making and soliciting suggestions. The thread now runs to 154 pages. Yggdrasil’s criteria for what qualifies as a good white-nationalist film include: “Positive portrayal of whites in defense against the depredations of liberalism, crime, and attack by alien races”; “Positive portrayal of heterosexual relationships and sex, marriage, procreation and child rearing”; “Portrayals of white males as intelligent, sensitive and strong – in positive leadership roles and or romantic leads”; and “Particularly intense portrayals of white female beauty, in non-degrading roles”. Disqualifying themes include homosexuality, racial mixing, negative portrayals of Christianity and portrayals of white people as inferior. The Northman pretty much ticks all these boxes, but then so do many other movies. Indeed, if you are looking for a Hollywood movie to support white-supremacist beliefs, you don’t have to look very far. Some of Stormfront’s film recommendations are predictable: The Birth of a Nation, Triumph of the Will, Braveheart, Zulu, a lot of Jane Austen, Shakespeare and Clint Eastwood. Few will be surprised to see The Lord of the Rings movies come highly recommended. Neither JRR Tolkien nor Peter Jackson consciously framed the fantasy epic as white-nationalist propaganda, but, as with Nordic mythology, it harks back to an imaginary Eurocentric realm in which the heroes are considered to be white-skinned (and were cast as such in the movies) and the chief enemies, the orcs, are characterised as dark-skinned, ugly and uncivilised. Derek Black, the son of Stormfront’s founder, Don Black (a prominent Ku Klux Klan leader), even started a dedicated Lord of the Rings section on the website as a teenager. “I figured you could probably get people who liked such a super-white mythos – a few of them are probably gonna be turned on by white nationalism,” he told the New York Times in 2017 (Black renounced his white-nationalist beliefs in 2013). More recent medieval sagas have been venerated by the far right for similar reasons. Game of Thrones, for example, also set up a dynamic of white, northern Europeans battling darker-skinned nomadic barbarians (the Dothraki), who come to be led by a pale-skinned, fair-haired woman. The far right heartily approved of Zack Snyder’s action epic 300, in which heroic, muscular, barely clothed Spartan warriors bravely repel an invading army of Persians. The contrast between these manly action heroes and the anonymous keyboard warriors who idolise them is difficult to ignore. Other recommendations on Stormfront’s list are more surprising, such as Notting Hill. Few would have marked the Richard Curtis romcom as a key white-nationalist text, even if it was criticised at the time for excluding people of colour from its multicultural London neighbourhood. But, from the perspective of a white-nationalist blogger, Notting Hill is a story “in which the white victims of culture destruction … manage to extricate themselves and find happiness”. In recent years, the far right has been more strident about movies it doesn’t like, which is almost everything. On social media and chatrooms such as 4chan and Reddit, far-right posters – overwhelmingly white and male – vilify Hollywood output, usually for being too inclusive, progressive or “woke”. Targets have included the all-female remake of Ghostbusters, the new Star Wars movies, Doctor Who and the Marvel films. As well as criticising, the far right has mounted coordinated attacks to lower these movies’ scores on reviews sites such as Rotten Tomatoes. “There’s a definite element of: ‘The movies that we loved when we were kids are not as good any more,’ which is partly because you’re not a kid,” says Alan Finlayson, a professor of political and social theory at the University of East Anglia. He led a three-year research project on the far right and its use of digital platforms. From its point of view, says Finlayson, western culture is being continually corrupted, usually by an ill-defined power base (Jewish people, Marxists, liberals). “The paradox of these kind of groups is that, on the one hand, they are claiming they’re deeply attached to western culture and civilisation, but they also hate western culture and civilisation, because it’s awful and decadent and liberal. So they’ve got to kind of maintain these two things at the same time.” Harry Potter is an example of that, says Finlayson’s colleague Rob Topinka, a senior lecturer at Birkbeck, University of London. “Referring to Harry Potter fandom is a shorthand way of saying ‘mainstream liberal women’ and their kind of political thinking. But, at the same time, they call people who have been vaccinated ‘mudbloods’ and adopt the name ‘pureblood’ for themselves. So a lot of this is incoherent.” The far right also engages in more in-depth forms of movie commentary, via YouTube videos and podcasts. Far-right figureheads Richard Spencer and Mark Brahmin host a podcast that conducts 90-minute analyses of movies such as Tenet, GoldenEye and Midsommar, parsing their supposedly hidden meanings, often through a male-chauvinist and antisemitic lens. Midsommar, which deals with Scandinavian folklore in the present day, did not go down well. Brahmin described it as “a deep insult against our people”. We could see these activities simply as extreme forms of film criticism, but Josh Vandiver, a lecturer at Ball State University in Indiana who studies rightwing appropriations of popular culture, prefers to describe them as metapolitics. “If politics is the occupation of territory, metapolitics is the occupation of culture,” he says. “They are, at some level, creating a community. They comment upon films; they try to interpret them. That’s what they do together, at least publicly. And we could contrast that to more traditional forms of political organising that the far right for decades has not seen itself as able to do: marching in the streets or organising political parties. So, instead, they spend all this time on metapolitics.” It would be easy to blame the far right alone for this situation, but it has been given plenty to work with by Hollywood and academia. By and large, films – and the histories from which they draw – have been overwhelmingly controlled by people of white, European descent, whose own blind spots might well play into the far right’s hands. Especially when it comes to matters of race. After the Charlottesville rally in 2017, Dorothy Kim, an Asian American medieval literature lecturer at Brandeis University in Massachusetts, argued that “medieval studies is intimately entwined with white supremacy and has been so for a long time”. Academics had not done enough to counter myths that medieval Europe was a bastion of racial purity, said Kim, who was attacked by academics and the far right as a result. These myths were largely established by 19th-century historians with nationalist agendas, but more recent research reveals that societies such as those in Viking-era Scandinavia were in fact multicultural and multiracial. These people were travellers. They ranged far across Europe and the Arctic and they engaged and mixed with neighbouring cultures. While they were highly gendered societies, a recent Finnish study also found evidence of “gender-transgressing or gender-mixing practices, often of an openly sexual quality”, among such societies. Eggers himself pointed to recent DNA analysis of the remains of a high-ranking Viking warrior found in Sweden, which identified them as female. (Apparently, she is briefly included in The Northman, but viewers may struggle to spot her.) The far right’s love of medievalism was never about historical accuracy, says Kim; it was always about constructing narratives. “Invoking the medieval past has now become a more generalised sign of the alt-right,” she says, pointing to recent far-right terrorists and their scattershot allusions to Nordic lore. “The point is not the specifics of the historical detail or what certain medieval things may mean to certain subgroups. Instead, the point is to gather them all for the maximum amount of attention, to plant as many flags to say: ‘I am a white supremacist,’ and to activate other white-supremacist terrorists globally.” When it comes to movies such as The Northman, considerations of accuracy or research are red herrings, Kim says. Ultimately, these are creative choices. “What I am interested in is how to make their vision of the medieval past and, in this case, the medieval Scandinavian past, not some sort of catnip for white supremacists to use for future violent attacks.” Is such a goal achievable? Hollywood can create counternarratives without betraying the history or mythology. Amazon’s forthcoming Lord of the Rings series, The Rings of Power, has made a point of casting non-white actors to play elves and dwarves. Going slightly deeper, David Lowery’s atmospheric The Green Knight, released last year, reinvigorated Arthurian legend – a space as traditionally all-white as Viking history – by casting the India-born British actor Dev Patel as Gawain. (To his credit, Guy Ritchie did something similar, albeit to less acclaim, in his multicultural King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.) In terms of Norse mythology, look at Marvel’s handling of its Thor movies. Kenneth Branagh’s opening instalment was attacked in 2011 for casting Idris Elba as the Norse god Heimdall. As Elba said at the time: “Thor has a hammer that flies to him when he clicks his fingers. That’s OK, but the colour of my skin is wrong?” White-supremacist groups attempted to organise a boycott of Thor, but it had no significant impact on the movie’s box office takings. Taika Waititi, who is of Māori and Jewish descent, took things even further with part three, Thor: Ragnarok. As well as casting an African American woman, Tessa Thompson, as the ostensibly bisexual Norse warrior Valkyrie, Waititi’s film dealt with narratives of displacement, enslavement, colonialism and white-male fragility. Thor’s all-powerful hammer, Mjolnir, that beloved symbol of white supremacism, is casually disintegrated by Cate Blanchett’s Hela. She then proceeds to bring down the Norse realm of Asgard, figuratively and literally. “Look at these lies,” she says, stripping away a ceiling fresco to reveal an older one beneath, detailing how her father, Odin, built Asgard through violent conquest. “Proud to have it, ashamed of how he got it.” Judging by the trailer for the next instalment, Thor: Love and Thunder, Waititi is continuing down this road. There are hints of homoeroticism, while somehow Natalie Portman now wields Mjolnir. The far right is going to hate it. In an ideal world, film-makers wouldn’t have to give a moment’s thought to how their films might be co-opted by these groups; we could simply enjoy a movie such as The Northman as a piece of rousing, skilfully made entertainment. The fact that it is no longer possible to do so could be seen as a victory of sorts for the far right, but failing to consider the stories we tell from first principles could be part of the problem that created them in the first place. By this stage, in fact, film-makers ought to have realised that if the far right doesn’t hate your film, you might be doing something wrong.",Arts/Film,Norse code: are white supremacists reading too much into The Northman?,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/22/norse-code-white-supremacists-reading-the-northman-robert-eggers
4/22/2022,"A glowing silicone sun measuring 2.3 metres in diameter and a pinhead-size Pluto have been brought down to earth in an extraordinary scale model of the solar system aimed at giving the public a true sense of the huge size of space. The six-mile (10km) riverside sculpture trail opens in Derry on Friday as part of Unboxed, the £120m government-backed celebration of creativity that spans the UK over the coming months. Our Place in Space is one of 10 free-to-visit installations drawing on arts, science, engineering, technology and maths in the festival, originally commissioned in 2018 by Theresa May. Although some derided it as a “festival of Brexit”, its chief creative officer, Martin Green, has described Unboxed as the UK’s “biggest and most ambitious public creative programme”. The solar system trail, which will later move to other locations in Northern Ireland and to Cambridge, has been designed by the artist and author Oliver Jeffers, with support from leading astrophysicist Prof Stephen Smartt. Each planet model, hand-painted by Jeffers, sits within a colourful arched sculpture placed along the trail in scale with the vast distance between each planet in the solar system. “It makes the point that there’s an awful lot of space in space,” said Jeffers, whose award-winning children’s books include How To Catch a Star and Lost and Found. The trail – plus an accompanying augmented reality app, live events and a book written and illustrated by Jeffers to be published in the autumn – also highlights how the people of Earth have fought over space. “For centuries, we’ve defined ourselves by who we are and who we’re not. Which side we choose, on what ground we stand, who and what we fight for,” said Jeffers. “We hope to encourage people to reflect on humanity’s place within the universe, what it means to exist on Earth, the only place known to harbour life, and how to sustain such life for many generations to come. “With distance comes perspective – and what happens to our perspective on everything when we look back at Earth from space?” The model of Earth is 2.2cm, compared with the planet’s actual diameter of 7,917 miles (12,742km) – a scale of 591 million to one. “We settled on the scale pretty quickly when we realised 4mm was about as small as we could go for Pluto,” said Smartt. In a sign of public enthusiasm for space projects, 1,000 people have registered for an attempt in Derry on Saturday to beat the current record of 257 for the largest number of people dressed as astronauts in one place at the same time. Another 500 people are on a waiting list. Green, who is also chief creative officer of this year’s Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, said: “Our Place in Space is a wonderful way to explore our solar system right here on Earth, with Oliver’s beautiful sculptures of the planets adding a new dimension to the landscape in which they are placed. “Like other Unboxed projects, it’s a fabulous collision between art, science and technology and asks questions about who we are and our relationship to each other.” Our Place in Space runs until 16 October at three locations in Northern Ireland: Derry (22 April – 22 May), Divis and Black Mountain (30 July – 28 August) and the North Down Coastal route (17 September – 16 October). It will be in Cambridge 30 July – 28 August.",Arts/Culture,Solar system recreated in Derry sculpture trail,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/22/solar-system-recreated-in-derry-sculpture-trail
4/22/2022,"Ijust received a mysterious email. “Dear Wilfred,” it began. “You better be a baller by this time. You better have a hot wife and kids. I hope you have a Porsche. If not, I don’t know what is wrong with you man.” The 280-word message, which arrived in my inbox this week, on the morning of my 31st birthday, was actually from someone who I knew well: myself, exactly 10 years ago. It went on: “I’m just kidding. None of those things really matter. I just hope you’re living a good life, being a good person to the people around you, and not losing your sense of wonder about the world.” Since I was a teenager, I’ve been sending messages to the future using a free email service called FutureMe, which is kind of like a digital time capsule. It’s simple: you compose an email, enter a recipient, and select a date in the future. Once you submit it, your note is sealed away in FutureMe’s servers and won’t send until that date, which could be years or decades later. In a time of dopamine-drenched social media feeds, this might well be the world’s slowest messaging service. The site was launched in 2002, as a side project of Matt Sly and Jay Patrikios, programmers who were then in their 20s. Sly told me he had designed the site to be “super streamlined” so that it would be able to run indefinitely – at first the server costs were just $11 a month. Now, despite handling 10,000 to 20,000 emails every day, the server costs just a couple of hundred dollars a month and brings in far more in revenue, Sly said. He sold FutureMe to a digital memorials company last year but feels confident about its longevity. “The cool thing is the longer it’s around, the more kind of profound these experiences are, because 10, 15, 20 years is a long time,” said Sly, who writes about 10 letters to his future self every year. “It’s intense, as you experienced.” The first time I used this time machine, a high school crush and I sat next to each other just before we graduated and sent letters to each other one year in the future. She stayed in our home town; I moved across the country and got her email the next winter, during a snowfall in my lonely first semester. She wrote: “Right now, your probably somewhere in new york city, seeing amazing things, feeling amazing things. Amazing things that i probably can’t even imagine. I am REALLY REALLY excited, nervous, happy for you! I know you’ll become the person you want to be.” I mostly forgot about the service until I turned 21, when I got a short note from 17-year-old me congratulating me on being old enough to buy alcohol. (“Now go DRINKING!!!!” teenage me urged.) My 17-year-old self would be disappointed to learn I didn’t end up getting hammered that day. Instead, I penned the heartfelt letter to 31-year-old me. “I hope you can remember what it felt like to be 21,” young me wrote. “Because I have no idea what I want to do with my life right now, but it’s okay. Because I do have faith that things are going to find a way to work themselves out.” As I read it, I felt memories of the last decade wash over me. Twenty-one-year-old me would never have predicted that I would start my career in Hong Kong, as a journalist covering its tragic democracy movement. That I would return to New York City years later and work for a while delivering food. That we would face a pandemic amid resurgent white supremacy and accelerating climate catastrophe. Other things really did work out. I don’t have a wife or kids, but I am in a lovely relationship. I’ve stayed close with old friends and met new ones who have been there for me through many highs and lows. I now write full-time for publications I admired when I was younger. And 21-year-old me would be thrilled to know that marijuana is now legal in New York. Too often, when I think about the past, I fixate on the moments of pain and confusion. Or I dwell upon other dreams I had then that never came to pass. But the letter helped me celebrate the most important victories (“I hope you haven’t died yet, because that would actually kind of suck,” 21-year-old me noted). And it revealed that I didn’t need external success to grasp life’s bigger picture. “I can say, today, at age 21, I have no regrets so far,” I wrote. “I hope you don’t regret anything that’s happened since then. This world is far too beautiful to be wasting your time looking back and wishing you had done things differently.” I need to hold on to this. But life happens, and I’m sure I’ll forget it again. That’s why I’m going to send a message to my 41-year-old self. I’m going to tell him, truthfully, that I feel grateful for what I have. And remind him that the real challenge of adulthood isn’t getting ahead – but getting back to an understanding that the world is beautiful and limitless. Dear Wilfred, You better be a baller by this time. You better have a hot wife and kids. I hope you have a Porsche. If not, I don’t know what is wrong with you man. I’m just kidding. None of those things really matter. I just hope you’re living a good life, being a good person to the people around you, and not losing your sense of wonder about the world. It’s never too late to do that shit you’ve always wanted to do. It’s never too late to learn that thing you always wanted to learn. I can say, today, at age 21, I have no regrets so far. I hope you don’t regret anything that’s happened since then. This world is far too beautiful to be wasting your time looking back and wishing you had done things differently. I hope you can remember what it felt like to be 21. Because I have no idea what I want to do with my life right now, but it’s okay. Because I do have faith that things are going to find a way to work themselves out. So I’m actually just going to trust that as you read this, you’ll be nodding your head, because things did end up working out okay despite all your doubts and fears. I’m trusting that you’re well. Actually, now that I think of it, I hope you haven’t died yet, because that would actually kind of suck … but hey, not ruling it out … Anyway, I love you. Have a drink with me in celebration that you made it this far. Smoke some weed, if you’re not working for the government by now. Happy birthday, man.

But it’s a thrill to see your story taken in unexpected directions, overlaid with a great soundtrack (thank you David Holmes and Unloved) and dressed fantastically (that unforgettable pink tulle dress by Molly Goddard). And the actors. Who cares about plot minutiae when you’re watching Jodie Comer and Sandra Oh do their thing, with the sexual tension crackling and the sparks flying? It’s an extraordinary privilege to see your characters brought to life so compellingly. But the final series ending took me aback. In the last moments of the last episode, just hours after they’ve shared their first proper kiss, Villanelle is brutally gunned down and killed, leaving Eve screaming. We have followed their romance for three and a half years. The charged looks, the tears, the lovingly fetishised wounds, the endlessly deferred consummation. When Phoebe Waller-Bridge and I first discussed Villanelle’s character five years ago, we agreed that she was defined by what Phoebe called her “glory”: her subversiveness, her savage power, her insistence on lovely things. That’s the Villanelle that I wrote, that Phoebe turned into a screen character, and that Jodie ran with so gloriously. But the season four ending was a bowing to convention. A punishing of Villanelle and Eve for the bloody, erotically impelled chaos they have caused. A truly subversive storyline would have defied the trope which sees same-sex lovers in TV dramas permitted only the most fleeting of relationships before one of them is killed off (Lexa’s death in The 100, immediately after sleeping with her female love interest for the first time, is another example). How much more darkly satisfying, and true to Killing Eve’s original spirit, for the couple to walk off into the sunset together? Spoiler alert, but that’s how it seemed to me when writing the books. TV folk sometimes see ultra-fans of TV drama as weird and cranky, but for many young people living difficult and isolated lives, a show such as Killing Eve can be a lifeline. I recently heard from a young gay woman living in Russia. “Villanelle means the world to me,” she wrote. “She’s my comfort character, someone I’ve found representation, understanding, freedom, strength and bravery in. And I know that no TV writers can take her away because she’s ours – all of ours – and thanks to your books and our love she will live on forever.” I learned the outcome of the final episode in advance, and suspected, rightly, that fans would be upset. But to those fans, I would say this: Villanelle lives. And on the page, if not on the screen, she will be back.",Arts/Television & radio,‘Villanelle will be back!’ Killing Eve’s author speaks out over the catastrophic TV finale,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/22/killing-eve-writer-tv-finale
4/22/2022,"Psst, want to feel old? Liam Gallagher, the eternally chippy younger brother of rock, apparently now needs a hip replacement. At 49, the ex-Oasis frontman is suffering from arthritis, which he seems to be approaching with customary but misplaced stubbornness. This week it emerged that he is refusing to have the surgery his doctor recommended, because hip replacements are for old people. And who wants that? “I think I’d rather just be in pain,” he explained to Mojo magazine. “It’s the stigma, saying you’ve had your hips replaced.” Either he hasn’t seen the reboot of Sex and the City in which a fiftysomething Carrie has surgery on hers, or else – surprise, surprise – one lone stab at reinventing the idea of growing older for primetime isn’t nearly enough. Middle age is many things, but it isn’t always rock’n’roll. There comes a point when you can pull a muscle just by getting up too quickly from the sofa, and when the only phone number you come home clutching from a night out is that of a hotly recommended osteopath. While women are popularly supposed to mourn the fading of their looks in their 40s, nobody I know is traumatised by the odd grey hair or wrinkle. What we secretly fear instead is looming decrepitude, or the idea that one day our bodies may just stop doing what we need them to do. Generation X can’t afford to get old; not that kind of old, anyway. Gallagher’s body has to hold out long enough to headline Knebworth this summer. The rest of us, meanwhile, still have teenage kids to launch into the world, our own parents to look after, pensions whose pitiful inadequacy will keep us working into our 70s, and bosses seemingly just waiting for a chance to put us out to grass. We don’t have time to crumble. Even the Queen, for heaven’s sake, is said to fear using a wheelchair in public in case the bodily reality of being 96 is somehow seen as humiliating or diminishing, a sad reminder of the stigma still clinging to both disability and age. Yet those words – decrepitude, crumble, humiliating – give the game away. Is it really ageing itself we fear, or the horribly negative ideas attached to older bodies which we’ve unknowingly internalised, much as teenage girls absorb seemingly by cultural osmosis the sense that their (in retrospect glowingly perfect) bodies are too fat or too skinny, or just in some mysteriously undefined way shaming? A new book by the Yale professor of epidemiology Dr Becca Levy, Breaking the Age Code, argues that the grim assumptions we all unthinkingly soak up about growing older have a direct impact on how we actually cope. Levy’s research found that people with cheerily optimistic ideas about ageing lived a startling seven and a half years longer than those gloomily anticipating the worst. She finds that older people’s memory, balance or walking speed improve when they’re exposed to positive stereotypes – such as the idea that age brings wisdom – before testing, while exposure to the idea that older people are doddery and forgetful made them perform worse in physical tasks. Intriguingly, that mirrors more familiar research suggesting girls score worse in maths tests if told in advance that boys are better at maths, or that stereotypical assumptions about black college students can lower their grades. Most startlingly, Levy’s work suggests that even among people genetically susceptible to Alzheimer’s, those with positive beliefs are less likely to develop dementia. It may be that cheerfulness itself has some kind of chemical impact, lowering levels of stress hormones. Or it could be that people confident of thriving in old age are motivated to keep fit, eat healthily and push for medical interventions if something goes wrong, while those convinced that it’s downhill all the way from 40 resign themselves to falling apart. “I don’t mind a little pain,” said Gallagher unhelpfully. “Keeps you on your toes.” There’s an obvious risk here of falling into a sort of medical “lean in” doctrine, blaming sickness on an individual’s failure to be sufficiently upbeat rather than the structural inequalities driving public health. But if Levy is right, we should be worried that ageism is still the most socially acceptable form of hate speech, the one prejudice for which nobody ever seems to get cancelled. We should be worried too about the way it’s fuelled by economic resentment of baby boomers, and lockdown sceptics arguing that it wasn’t worth closing pubs to save pensioners who were probably going to die soon anyway. In reality, the typical person dying of Covid lost a good decade of life they’d otherwise have enjoyed, but since when did kneejerk prejudice bow to facts? During the pandemic, subconscious ageism may have cost lives, making us too slow to shield care homes from the virus. Yet according to what Levy suggests, it’s been quietly killing the middle aged for years: sapping confidence, breeding fatalism, making people feel bad not just about their necks (the title of Nora Ephron’s legendary collection of essays on female ageing) but apparently now their hips too. We are just so conditioned to see the older body as a source of shame; sagging, creaking, leaking, but not to be complained about to doctors because what did you expect, at your age? Well, maybe we should expect better. If Levy is right, lives depend on it.

4/22/2022,"Abumblebee buzzes comfortingly around my feet. Chiffchaffs chime in the trees and hidden Cetti’s warblers burst into short blasts of song. The reed and sedge warblers aren’t here yet, but any day now the reeds and bushes will be filled with their chattering and whistles. Across the river, two displaying lapwings squeal and curl and loop in the air. A piping redshank flies overhead. Both wader species are barely clinging on as breeding birds in the valley. I lift my face up to the warming sun, close my eyes and listen. This is the first time I’ve returned since my father passed away. We used to come here to listen to the birdsong and watch for owls in the evenings. This morning, I can feel the place work its soothing magic. The loud cries of crows make me look up and I see two huge, dark brown shapes flapping towards me – young white-tailed eagles. Birds from the Isle of Wight reintroduction project are now seen regularly in Sussex, including in the Arun Valley, but this will be my closest view yet. I watch them pass just 20 metres above my head, languidly flapping their broad, bent wings. They haven’t gained their adult plumage yet – their short tails, heads and heavy bills are still dark. They fly on purposefully, calling to each other with high-pitched squeaks, oblivious to me and all the attention from the local rooks, crows and two buzzards. They seem unassailable, indestructible, as if they’ve always been here. Like that of the lapwings and redshanks, their presence in this landscape is fragile – at least one of the eagles we saw in the valley last autumn has since been killed by poison in Dorset. But they belong in southern England. Some Sussex placenames remember this as their home, even if we don’t: Earnley or “erne leah” is Old English for “eagle clearing”; Eridge was once called Erne Rigg – eagle ridge. I watch the great birds climb into the sky on the thermals, circling higher and higher. I smile, thinking how my father would have loved to have seen them. Gradually, they drift away over the South Downs. As the wind picks up, two swallows fly upriver. There’s more cloud now and the sky is darkening. It’s time to move on.

4/22/2022,"The Australian arm of UBS should be banned from doing business in Papua New Guinea for ten years and former prime minister Peter O’Neill should be prosecuted over their roles in a loan that resulted in a huge loss to the country, current prime minister James Marape has said. A former government led by O’Neill obtained the AUD$1.3bn loan from global investment bank UBS in 2014, in order to acquire a 10.1% share interest in oil and gas exploration company Oil Search Limited. However the price of Oil Search shares soon plunged, with PNG’s shares later sold at a loss. Speaking to parliament on Wednesday after the conclusion of a commission of inquiry into the loan, Marape said the deal had cost the state “in excess of AUD$340m” as well as “lost opportunities” such as the establishment of a sovereign wealth fund and “diversion of revenues” from PNG’s LNG exports project. “The UBS loan had no satisfactory justification or rationale, there was failure to follow processes, apart from a huge fee of AUD$28m,” Marape said. “UBS also overcharged AUD$175m which should be repaid.” He also said the commission’s final report recommended that lawyers engaged by the state from the Australian branch of Norton Rose Fulbright did not give “proper advice” and that the unit should be banned from doing business in the country for five years. Mr O’Neill “knew the submission was complex and lengthy” but did not give the rest of the cabinet “advance notice or opportunity to debate the submission”, he added. Marape, who took over as prime minister from O’Neill in 2019 and initiated the commission’s inquiry, was serving as finance minister when the deal was struck. O’Neill said he “fully accepted the recommendations from the inquiry into the deal” and would “subject himself for further investigations.” “I am very happy to defend myself whether at ICAC [Independent Commission Against Corruption] or at the courts. So I have no issues with that, I am responsible to the people of Papua New Guinea. I am responsible as a mandated leader.” “The inquiry into the UBS deal was the most expensive of all inquiries at 30 million kina [11 million AUD] and very highly politicized,” he added. A UBS spokesperson said the company disagreed with the statements made by Marape in parliament and “strongly disputes assertions that it overcharged PNG”. The bank had been appointed to act for PNG to obtain the loan “following a competitive tender process” and the government “received advice from a number of experienced independent Australian and Papua New Guinean legal and financial advisors throughout the transaction”, the spokesperson said. “UBS maintains its dealings with PNG were appropriate and transparent. The transaction was entered into by PNG under the relevant legislation and properly ratified by PNG Parliament in 2014 in accordance with the Constitution,” the spokesperson said, adding that the bank’s net revenue from the deal was less than AUD$50m. “UBS provided a detailed account of the transaction to the Commission via two comprehensive statements (August 2021 and March 2022) and other supporting documentation,” the spokesperson said. “UBS believes that its responses, including its critique of the Brattle analysis and conclusions, were not appropriately considered by Counsel Assisting the Commission.” A Norton Rose spokesperson declined to comment.",News/World news,"UBS should be banned from doing business in PNG after loan deal, PM tells parliament",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/22/ubs-should-be-banned-from-doing-business-in-png-after-loan-deal-pm-tells-parliament
4/22/2022,"For many in Beita, a town of about 15,000 in the northern West Bank, the killing by Israeli security forces of Fawaz Hamayel last week has left a sense of being collectively orphaned. “We lost the soul of Beita. He was everything for everyone,” said his nephew Ahmad, of the 47-year-old father of three who was a pillar of the tightly knit community. He was mortally wounded in what security forces have described as “counter-terrorist activities” in Beita and other locales in the northern West Bank spurred by a deadly wave of Palestinian attacks inside Israel. Fawaz was known for protesting against the occupation. He played an active role as a nationalist, simultaneously as an official dealing with Jerusalem affairs in the Palestinian Authority, an activist in Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas’s Fatah organisation, and a driving force behind Beita’s stubborn resistance to efforts to establish a new settlement on its land. “He was definitely an example to the young people and old people,” Ahmad said. But neither the man nor his town had clear links to the recent rise in bloodshed, including the killing of three people in a Tel Aviv bar earlier this month. Beita deputy mayor, Mohammed Hamayel, a distant relative who was with Fawaz at the time he was shot, said he was posing no threat. He had gone outside upon hearing there were wounded Palestinians to discern if there were other residents who were injured and to take pictures, the deputy mayor said. Fawaz used to distribute pictures from Beita to news outlets. The Israeli army implied in response to a query that Fawaz was a participant in a violent riot in which stones and petrol bombs were thrown by Palestinians. The death came after 11 months in which Beita residents sustained a costly resistance effort, slinging stones and rolling burning tyres against soldiers guarding the empty buildings of the planned settlement. Troops have used teargas, rubber-coated metal bullets and at times live fire from snipers, according to Palestinians and Israeli solidarity activists. Fawaz helped organise and document the protests, held after mosque prayers every Friday. Mourners said he had a great memory and was also the town’s “archive”, knowing the dates of the deaths of all of Beita’s “martyrs” including nine shot dead by security forces during the time of the protests. On 13 April, with tensions rising in the West Bank and Jerusalem, Fawaz woke up very early as usual to clean up the Othman Ibn Affan mosque before the imam arrived. Soon afterwards hundreds of Israeli forces, according to locals, arrived in and around Beita. Seven Beita residents were injured during the raid, one of them shot in the eye and another in the head, said the deputy mayor. Four people were arrested and later released, he said, adding that security forces had targeted Beita because of its resistance to the settlement. “They steal our land. How can we accept that?” he said. “This will increase our hostility to Israelis and our determination to have our freedom and live in dignity in our land.” The deputy mayor termed the raid “systemic terrorism”. Three thousand people, including senior Palestinian Authority officials, attended Fawaz Hamayel’s funeral. But that seemed of small comfort to friends and relatives gathered in the home of Fawaz’s brother Aziz on Tuesday. “Why did they come here in the first place?” his elderly mother, Faiza, cried. “Why do they provoke us? We didn’t do anything.” The sense was that the Palestinians had lost an authentic and legitimate grassroots leader. A relative showed a picture of Fawaz sitting at his office desk in a suit and tie at the Jerusalem governorate headquarters, where he was director for public affairs. His duties were diverse, including helping drug addicts, his brother said. His son Qais, 16, smiled, not seeming to grasp yet the enormous loss: “I promise in front of all of you that I will do my best to study hard in school so I can study to be a doctor like Dad wanted,” he said. Beita has become a symbol for Palestinians of popular resistance to Israel’s occupation. But this has come at tremendous cost. According to the UN coordinator of humanitarian affairs office in Jerusalem, there have been more than 1,200 Palestinian gunshot injuries in Beita from Israeli rubber-coated metal bullets and live fire since May last year. Some people have been shot more than once. About 150 Beita residents are now disabled due to Israeli fire, according to the local municipality. Between 10 and 20 members of Israeli security forces have been substantially injured, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) spokesperson said last month. Seen from Beita, the world has a double standard when it comes to Palestinians. “Here in Palestine, people are being killed and the international community is silent. Israel is above the law. We are humans like the Ukrainians but no one holds Israel to account,” Aziz Hemayel said. The IDF said that during the 13 April “counter-terrorist” action mounted in Beita, dozens of Palestinians rioted and hurled rocks and molotov cocktails at troops. “The soldiers responded with riot dispersal means and live ammunition. A hit was identified.” Almost all of the West Bank locales targeted recently were not linked with the attacks in Israel, Palestinians say. Menachem Klein, a professor emeritus at Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv and a visiting professor in King’s College London’s war studies department, said the idea of the raids was to “deter” Palestinians. “[It’s to] show the army is almighty and regain control.”",News/World news,‘Why do they provoke us?’: West Bank leader’s death brings grief – and anger,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/22/why-do-they-provoke-us-west-bank-leaders-death-brings-grief-and-anger
