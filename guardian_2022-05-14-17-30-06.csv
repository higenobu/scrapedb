5/14/2022,"There are three things wrong with The Time Traveler’s Wife (Monday 16 May, 9pm, Sky Atlantic), the HBO miniseries of the 2003 book that already spawned a 2009 film (I am past caring about remakes, before you start; I live in a post-caring about remakes world). The first is the music, which seems more befitting of a 90s adventure movie where a boy moves house but forgets his beloved dog. A minor quibble, but you won’t be able to un-hear it once you notice it, too. The second and third problems are the same issue in different forms: The Time Traveler’s Wife miniseries is affected by two of the dominant trends in TV and film-making over the last 15 years – to-camera mockumentary confessionals, and the smart-alec dialogue of Marvel movies. Put it like this: if I went back in time and made it so that Iron Man and Rashida Jones’s entire TV career never happened, The Time Traveler’s Wife would be a completely different show. A much, much better show. I’ll get the Marvel stuff out of the way so fans who set up Google Alerts about the movies can quickly skip to berating me on Twitter: I like Marvel movies, I think it’s impressive that they have re-invented the “supporting movie franchises like a football team” thing they cribbed from Star Wars, and it’s equally impressive that all those dozens of movies and shows later there is still a cohesive through-line to the whole thing. That said, Marvel’s signature “Yeah ... that just happened”, hollow-centred snappy banter has personally started to grate, so to see it show up in The Time Traveler’s Wife is particularly jarring. In Marvel movies, those affectedly light moments are so good at punctuating the earnestness of superheroes declaring undying love in the midst of an alien war; in a TV production that is essentially a romantic drama with a pesky sci-fi element getting in the way, it gets annoying fast. Rose Leslie’s Clare and Theo James’s Henry are both very good, but sometimes they talk to each other like they’re two Funko Pops trying to birth a new catchphrase. The other trope leaned on here is the to-camera confessional, made popular by the behemothic American Office and stolen wholesale by Parks and Recreation and now I never, ever ever have to see it again. To reiterate: in future, if an actor speaks into a camera with a faux-puzzled, “Where do I start?” while a fake “REC” blinks in the corner, I will be switching off. Throughout The Time Traveler’s Wife – and if you’ve not read the book or seen the movie, it’s a delightfully full-hearted romantic story where mortal Clare and out-of-control time-travel weirdo Henry fall in love, just in a different chronological order to one another – we see the two leads sigh and wistfully tell their sides of the story to the camera (in fluent Marvelese, of course, so it’s either vague-but-powerful-feeling statements about human nature or some goofy gag that happens before Theo James’s clothes fly off, which they do almost constantly). I see the perks of this – we, the dim-witted audience, are given an out-loud peek into a character’s psyche and their emotional reaction to any given situation, because they explain it to us like we’re idiots – but … hmm, no. That’s what’s bad about it, too. Please, television, let me figure out what a character is thinking without them telling me! I know time travel is complex, but let me do a bit of the heavy lifting!Despite that – despite The Time Traveler’s Wife dinging not one but two of my TV pet peeves – I found myself really enjoying it. Theo James makes a good swing at levelling up from being the handsome guy in forgettable sci-fi (this, plus his upcoming White Lotus role, will probably assure he does make the Marvel leap sooner rather than later). Rose Leslie almost pulls off playing an age range of 16 to 80. Two British actors doing American accents very rarely feels delirious. The whole thing is headed up by Steven Moffat, and you can tell: given the extra time TV allows a story like this, and the freedom to spin out additional threads by updating it to the present day, you see a denser cast of characters and high-quality playfulness with the core sci-fi idea that you might not get from someone who isn’t yet bored of winning Baftas. All in all, it’s very good. I’d just loved to have seen it on the alternate timeline where it wasn’t also a little annoying.",Arts/Television & radio,The Time Traveler’s Wife: this sci-fi romance may be full of TV pet peeves – but it’s very enjoyable,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/14/the-time-travelers-wife-this-sci-fi-romance-may-be-full-of-tv-pet-peeves-but-its-very-enjoyable
5/14/2022,"Susanna Abse is the marriage counsellor’s marriage counsellor – 30 years in practice giving her peerless insights into the challenges couples face without making any dent in her curiosity and originality. This serene, witty 65-year-old is exacting but non-judgmental; I imagine you’d feel able to say absolutely anything in front of her, unless it was bullshit. You would trust her with your marriage, but you’d want to take your A-game. Abse can’t begin to estimate how many couples she’s seen since her first in 1986, but puts it at tens of thousands of hours. She has worked with every kind of couple, from the ones who “bang their heads together and shout and stand up and walk out” (she calls these “doll’s house” couples in her book – people who break things without any sense of consequence), to the ones who think there’s never been anything wrong, and can’t understand why they’ve suddenly got issues. She typically sees a couple weekly or biweekly. Her work is instinctive: a couple will continue to meet with her for as long as it takes. “I absolutely never know whether a couple will separate or not,” she says. Post-Covid, there has been a rise in the number of couples seeking therapy, but it’s perhaps not as dramatic as you might expect. If the field is booming, it’s because millennials, and couples even younger, are seeking help earlier in their relationship – at a point when older generations would have just called it quits. The rise probably isn’t hurt by the popularity of shows such as the BBC’s Couples Therapy, which sheds a light on this usually hidden process. When she started practising, “there used to be a rule that you never asked a question, as a psychoanalytic practitioner”, she says. “Now, most therapists are much more interactive and will ask questions directly about what the problem is.” Abse’s approach is distinctive in that “I never can see a person without asking about all the people who’ve been around them, or not around them. They are always in the context of a relationship with other people, or a missing relationship with somebody.” In the 1990s, the work of the celebrated American psychologist John Gottman was fashionable in marriage circles: published in 1983, the “four horsemen” theory was that you could predict which couples would fall apart from four red flags: criticism, defensiveness, contempt and stonewalling. That’s fallen out of fashion, too, and Abse says “Lots of couples will be contemptuous at moments, or stonewall at moments. It’s a defence, isn’t it? Or a retaliation. My job is to trace it back to its origins, when it started between the couple, and then further back – what the meaning of it is for them as individuals in relation to their own childhood experience.” Abse doesn’t do rules. So let’s just call this list eight essential truths for a happy relationship. Usually, if a couple never argues, it’s because “things have been parked”, says Abse. “Once you open things up, actually there is quite a lot of feeling there, and upset – there’s just been smoothing over and covering up.” Broadly speaking, it militates against intimacy, if you won’t show yourself to one another. In Abse’s book, Tell Me the Truth About Love, she describes a “babes in the wood” couple, two people who have so strenuously avoided all conflict with each other that they turn their anger outwards and are in constant combat with neighbours, family, friends. Alternatively, avoidant couples can find that their children become the “repository for trouble. The couple are very joined and reasonable and nice. And then they’ve a child who’s beating people up, doing drugs, acting out. All the difficulty between them has got projected on to the child.” “I often make the joke: ‘I’ve listened carefully to all the submissions and I pronounce … ’” says Abse. “To say, look, the two of you feel that this is a courtroom, and you’re giving me evidence. There’s a vulnerability there, that I’ll judge them; that one has done something heinous and is in the doghouse, and the other’s in the clear. It’s not like that at all. You’ve cooked this up together.” One example of where people are looking for adjudication is closeness. “One person wants to get closer, and the other person finds ways to distance,” she says, and they might think a therapist can tell them who’s in the right. But there’s no right or wrong because they’ve created this situation together. Usually, there’s a system there, what family therapy used to call a distance regulation system. There’s an unconscious collusion to maintain the distance between them, even if only one person’s complaining about it.” This is the old saw about marital conflict, that you should use “I” words rather than accusations. It’s worth examining why the accusation is easier: you make yourself very vulnerable when you describe your own feelings, particularly if they’re fearful or sad. “This is probably not just between couples, this is a disease of humans,” says Abse, “that we’re so worried about our vulnerability that we’re aggressive in order to cover it up. Sometimes it’s not safe to show people how fragile you are.” It’s better to show your hand: “If you feel anxious about talking to somebody, don’t just tell them the thing, tell them you’re worried about telling them the thing. Signal that it’s difficult for you.” One message that comes across in so many – maybe all – relationship difficulties is that what drew the couple together in the first place was not a shared love of hiking or a similar education, but mirroring dynamics in their childhood that they’re hoping to recreate, or overcome, or both, or maybe they don’t know which. “Those expectations that you’re going to meet a loving, parental figure that you longed for in your childhood – couples can do that for one another, but this becomes impossible when you throw children into the equation. Because then there’s a real infant there, and there isn’t a lot left over for mothering and parenting each other. It becomes a conflict of needs.” Relationship satisfaction typically crashes after children. However, “lots of couples do grow and mature and deepen their intimacy via having children”. So maybe the rule is, do it or don’t, just be aware that it will change your relationship in a way that you can’t prevent, and nor can you get ahead of how that change will make you feel. “There are a lot of nonsexual couples,” Abse says, deploying the non-prescriptive tone that is her trademark. “Obviously that’s possible. But if you’re in your 20s, 30s, 40s and probably up to your mid-50s, and there’s absolutely no sex, there’s a risk that it is going to lead to the end of the relationship. People want the release, they want the intimacy, it’s an important part of life.” If your sex life flags, don’t just assume it’ll pick back up; anxiety builds around it, and with it the ability to communicate. “You see the couples who’ve not had sex for 25 years, who come and say ‘Can you help us?’, when they’re in their early 60s. Probably not. “They really are corrosive,” Abse says. “They fundamentally undermine a sense of security, and you need that in order to be able to have difference and conflict and resolution.” When I was young, I used to find it funny that everyone thought their mum had histrionic personality disorder and their dad was on the spectrum. Now, everyone thinks their spouse has borderline personality disorder or ADHD. “I understand it with children – you have to label them in order to get resources. But I don’t think it’s helpful at all with adults,” says Abse. “I have some patients who’ve got autistic features, but so what? You still have to figure it out. Diagnosing adults with ADHD is bonkers. Just call it anxiety.” “So often, couples come and think, ‘We’re in couples therapy. It’s all over’. They want it to be nice, they want you to be nice, they want them to be nice. They want to feel safe – quite understandably. It’s a scary thing.” And the looming fear, of course, is that the endpoint is separation. But the process of seriously examining any relationship is “so often about psychic separation, because they’re caught up in a dynamic in which they’ve got very confused. They’re projecting on to each other, they’re confused about who’s who. It always involves separation in terms of looking at somebody again. It’s just a question of whether it’s a real separation.” It takes courage. Abse’s book is dedicated to her husband of 40 years. It reads: “To Paul, my fellow truth-seeker.” It’s true, she says, “that is what’s going on. He thinks he’s got the truth, and I know I have.” Tell Me the Truth About Love: 13 Tales from the Therapist’s Couch by Susanna Abse is published by Ebury (£16.99).

5/14/2022,"A popular tax break for working from home that gave many people’s finances a small boost during the pandemic has become harder to claim, and most employees will no longer be eligible. With millions of people back in the office for at least part of the week, experts say you can now claim tax relief for working from home only if you meet strict conditions. Some commentators are urging employees to check their PAYE tax codes, because if HM Revenue and Customs has included the relief when you are no longer eligible you could potentially end up with a surprise tax bill. But one bit of good news is that if you were required to work from home but did not get round to claiming, it is not too late. You can still claim for previous years. Tax relief linked to working from home predates the pandemic – it was introduced almost 20 years ago. However, in 2020 the government relaxed the rules, which meant suddenly millions of people who were forced to work from home during lockdowns were able to claim tax relief worth up to £125 a year. In autumn 2020, HMRC launched an online portal for employees to make a claim without having to provide receipts or do complicated calculations. And, to make things even easier, eligible workers could claim a full year’s entitlement even if they had to work from home for only one day during the tax year. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it has been a popular tax break. Millions of people have successfully claimed it, sending the bill for the relief soaring from about £2m a year before the Covid crisis to nearly £500m over the two years of the pandemic, according to reports.Some people were probably expecting they could just claim again. The tax relief was offered to workers provided they were told by their employer, rather than chose, to work from home, and provided they did not receive home expenses payments from their company. Once the application was approved, the portal adjusted the individual’s tax code, and they received the tax relief directly through their salary. Your claim was based on the assumption that you incurred costs of £6 a week while working from home, so you got back the tax that you would have paid on that sum. For basic-rate taxpayers the relief was worth 20% of the £6: £1.20 a week. Higher-rate taxpayers could claim 40% of the £6: £2.40 a week. Over the course of the year, this meant people could reduce the tax they paid by £62.40 or £124.80 respectively. The relief relates to household costs such as gas and electricity, metered water and business phone calls, though under the rules, you can’t claim for the whole bill, “just the part that relates to your work”. Tax experts say the rules have not changed. Instead the gradual easing of Covid restrictions means that most people’s circumstances have. As a result, HMRC has updated the guidance to make clear that you cannot claim the relief if there is an element of choice in your working from home. Joanne Walker, a technical officer at the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, says the rules were relaxed for 2020-21 and 2021-22 in favour of employees, but as of April this year, HMRC was following the rules fully again. She says that, as before Covid, people can now only claim the tax relief if they met the conditions set out in HMRC’s Employment Income Manual 32760. These rules are quite strict: for example, it must generally be the case that no facilities for doing your work are available to you on your company’s premises. Robert Salter, a client tax director at accountants Blick Rothenberg, said recently that employees should check their tax codes to see if HMRC has included the relief. “If this is the case, unless they are still eligible for the relief in 2022-23, they should contact HMRC to get the notice of coding corrected. Otherwise they will have additional tax to pay at the end of the tax year,” he said. He added that the work-from-home relief was available from 6 April 2022 onwards only if your employer specifically required you to work from home – for example, to stop the spread of Covid or because your job had been “relocated” and was now contractually regarded 100% as a home-working role. “If, for example, your employer simply now allows staff to work flexibly – ie, being in the office or working from home as it suits each individual – the home office relief ceases to be available for the 2022-23 tax year.”",News/Business,Working from home: HMRC’s £125 tax break now harder to claim,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/14/hmrc-tax-break-home-workers-claim-covid-relief-office
