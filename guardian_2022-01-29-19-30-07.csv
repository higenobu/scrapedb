1/29/2022,"Ash Barty has become the first Australian to win their home Open in 44 years after beating the 27th seeded American Danielle Collins 6-3, 6-6(2) at Melbourne Park. The No 1 seed Barty has been in imperious form throughout the tournament and she dominated the early exchanges in the final on Rod Laver Arena, forcing Collins into errors as she took the first set comfortably. But the American soon turned up the power and Barty’s record of having gone through the tournament without losing a set was heavily threatened when she trailed 5-1 in the second. However, the Australian rallied brilliantly to secure two breaks and recover to win the tie-break in dominant fashion to complete her coronation as champion.  It is the 25-year-old’s third grand slam, following on from her French Open win in 2019 and last year’s Wimbledon title, but not since Chris O’Neil in 1978 has a home crowd had the pleasure of watching an Australian win a slam in Melbourne and they certainly lapped it up.

1/29/2022,"Four-year-old Joanna Gillikin likes to watch Ada Twist, Scientist, a Netflix children’s show about a young girl with a giant interest in science.  So when Matthew Gillikin and his wife, Shannon, enrolled Joanna in a trial in Charlottesville, Virginia, for the Pfizer vaccine against Covid-19, they described it to her as a science experiment, like the ones Ada does. “Her mind was able to latch onto the fact that not only is she participating in something that could make her healthier, but also help make other people healthier,” said Matthew, a speech therapist. Many parents across the United States are eagerly waiting to see whether Joanna and other trial participants can help them. They are upset that more than a year after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the vaccines for emergency use for adults, they are still not available to children under five. Now, as the number of new Covid cases continues to fall in parts of the country and talk has returned of figuring out how to forge a ‘new normal’ after the pandemic, some parents of the young children – and their pediatricians – feel as though that population has been left behind. They think the FDA has not acted with enough urgency to make the vaccines available, leaving young children vulnerable to the virus and unable to return to ordinary life. “It’s just about time that we really prioritize these young children,” said Dr Alpa Shah, a pediatrician in Milwaukee. “The narrative throughout this pandemic has been, ‘Well, Covid is mild in these young kids, and the vaccine is now available to children,’ and it’s almost as if we are forgetting that there is a population of children that doesn’t have a means of protection.” Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech have encountered setbacks in their trials for that age group. In December, the companies announced that two doses of the vaccine triggered a sufficient immune response in children six months to two-years-old, but not in kids aged two to four. As such, they said they would add a third dose for children under five. The decision “reflects the companies’ commitment to carefully select the right dose to maximize the risk-benefit profile”, they said in a statement. If the study is successful, the companies expect to submit data to request emergency use authorization in the first half of 2022. Dr Anthony Fauci, the White House’s chief medical adviser, said earlier this month that he hopes the FDA authorizes the vaccine for children in that age group in the coming weeks. Moderna, which has not had its vaccine authorized in the United States for anyone under age 18, announced earlier this month that it expects to report data for children ages two to five in March and then potentially seek FDA authorization. Shah, who has a 2-year-old daughter, said she understands that the FDA wants to ensure the vaccine is safe and doesn’t place blame on a particular group. But she thinks the government should adjust its authorization process. Shah was among more than 250 physicians who signed an open letter posted last week urging Dr Janet Woodcock, the FDA acting commissioner, to allow “providers and parents the option of joint decision-making to immunize children with off-label use”, meaning without government approval. The group, Protecting Their Future, also suggested that the FDA diverge from its normal age de-escalation approval process in which a vaccine is tested among the oldest age groups and then gradually tested among younger people. They would like to see the agency authorize the Pfizer vaccine for ages six months to two years because of the apparently successful results for that subgroup. While the general population can choose which safety measures to follow, including getting vaccinated, “our children don’t have a choice”, the letter states. CJ Koeninger, a coordinator of a children’s ministry in Madison, Wisconsin, has been especially concerned about Covid because her two daughters, Piper and Ellie, now seven and four, were both hospitalized shortly before the pandemic due to asthma exacerbation. Children with moderate to severe asthma are at a greater risk of becoming severely ill from Covid, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). While both girls’ asthma is now well controlled, Koeninger said their hospitalization has “made all the messaging about ‘Kids are fine. It’s not a big deal for kids,’ a little bit frustrating because, well, you don’t know my kids”. Of the more than 848,000 people who have died in the United States from Covid, 727 have been under age 18, according to the CDC. Less than 1.5% of child Covid cases have resulted in hospitalization, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). But the number of Covid cases has increased dramatically recently due to the Omicron variant. There were more than 1.1 million child Covid cases reported the week ending 20 January, five times the rate of the peak of the winter surge in 2021, according to the AAP. The number of people under age 18 who were hospitalized with Covid also spiked during the Omicron surge, but fell by 8.9% the week of Jan. 16, according to the CDC. “The AAP shares your concerns about the inaccurate and harmful media narrative that Covid-19 illness is ‘mild’ in children,” Dr Sandy Chung, the AAP president elect, stated in an email to Shah. “We are in close contact with colleagues at CDC and FDA and have been urging them to prioritize the research and approval process for pediatric vaccines for nearly two years.” Koeninger, who tried to enroll Ellie in a trial, doesn’t understand why groups could not have conducted vaccine trials for different age groups simultaneously. “We are all just so tired,” Koeninger, 32, said of parents of young children. “It feels like the world has moved on, everyone thinks the pandemic is over, and we are still quarantining every few weeks.” While Eric Rubin, an immunologist at Harvard University and member of the FDA advisory committee, said he is sympathetic to parents whose children aren’t yet eligible for the vaccine, he does “not want to second guess the process”. For trials, researchers treat older people first because a potential side effect could become “more acute as you get younger and younger, so one way to make sure you put the smallest number of people at risk is to work” your way down, explained Rubin, who like other members of the advisory committee, has not seen data from the trials. As to the request for the FDA to authorize the Pfizer vaccine just for children ages six months to two years, Rubin explained that studies are designed for a certain number of people, and subgroups are often too small to offer proof. Dr Jay Portnoy, an advisory committee member and medical director at Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri, saw the number of children with Covid in his hospital increase during the Omicron wave and said he understands parents’ frustration. But he still said he would not endorse off-label usage of the Pfizer vaccine, as Protecting Their Future suggests. “There is a reason why the label is the way it is, and if it becomes the wild west and everyone just starts doing things willy-nilly, there is no way we are going to be able to keep track of adverse events and how effective it is and all kinds of complications could occur that I would be worried about,” said Portnoy. Kelly Edinger, a mother of three in Troy, Missouri, tried unsuccessfully to get her youngest daughter, Kennedi, four, into a vaccine trial and is disappointed that she hasn’t been able to get the shots. But she said she understands the delay. “They want to make sure it’s safe, and I think I like that idea better, as long as I know they are taking the right steps,” said Edinger, who stays home and helps her children with their virtual school. Though Gillikin was able to enroll Joanna in a trial, it hasn’t changed much for his family because they don’t know if she received three doses of the vaccine or a placebo. Gillikin also sees the ongoing harm caused by the virus because he primarily works with adults at UVA Hospital who have swallowing problems. It’s often because they had Covid and were intubated to help them breathe. “We have so many Covid patients right now. It’s the highest it’s been in the whole pandemic,” Gillikin said earlier this week. Even if they learn that Joanna was vaccinated, the family’s activities will still depend in part on the prevalence of the virus, he said. “We haven’t attended indoor church since the pandemic started, and I think that’s something we would be interested in doing again once they are vaccinated,” Gillikin said of the kids. “I would like for [Joanna] to be able to have friends over for playdates.”",News/World news,‘We are so tired’: US parents and doctors say kids under five left behind in Covid vaccine race,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/29/us-parents-kids-under-five-covid-vaccine
1/29/2022,"Everyone misses something. For some, it’s quite specific: PG Tips, Branston pickle, proper curry. For many, it’s more intangible: the atmosphere of an English pub; that greenness, everywhere; tolerance; and British openness. Then they pause. Actually, many formerly British-resident EU nationals say, what they miss is an idea. Or, to be precise, the idea of Britain they had before 24 June 2016: all of them remember, in painful, pin-sharp detail, how they felt, and what they did, the morning after.  While it is clear that EU immigration into the UK has declined sharply since 31 January last year, when Britain finally left the bloc’s orbit and free movement came to an end, it is hard to say exactly how many EU nationals have left since the Brexit referendum. The figures are confusing. The ONS says Brexit and the pandemic prompted more than 200,000 EU nationals to go in 2020, leaving a total of 3.5 million in the UK – but the Home Office says it has received 6m applications for settled status. Jobs data suggests 9% fewer EU nationals were working in Britain last year than in 2019. Immigration experts, however, say the official data is insufficient, and almost certainly underestimates the true number of departures by a significant margin. Elena Remigi is a translator and interpreter who, after the shock of the referendum result, set up In Limbo, a Facebook group for EU citizens in the UK and Britons on the continent. She reckons more than 20% of the 100-plus EU citizens whose testimonies she published in the first of the project’s two books in 2017 have now left Britain. “Some went right after the vote,” says Remigi, who has lived in Britain for 15 years. “Others waited for job offers. More left in 2020, in the transition period, when British partners could still settle easily in the EU. The pandemic convinced another lot to go.” But for all the confusion around the exact numbers, few experts doubt that the bitterness created by Brexit, combined with longer-term concerns about becoming second-class citizens, have prompted many to go. Early reports of unfair “hostile environment” treatment of legally resident EU citizens have spurred the exodus: EU nationals arriving for job interviews have been locked up, and others legally resident in Britain have been detained. When the Independent Monitoring Authority, which was set up under the Brexit deal to protect the rights of EU citizens settled in the UK, surveyed 3,000 EU nationals in the UK last summer, it found one in three lacked trust in the government, and one in 10 were planning to leave. Last month, the same body launched legal action against the Home Office, accusing it of breaching EU nationals’ basic rights. Many, of course, have decided to stay, regardless. For those who decided to go, the decision was rarely easy. Often, they had been living, working and bringing up families in Britain for decades. Some took British partners – often with equally strong feelings about Brexit – with them. Others separated. They are still scarred. We settled, they say, contributed, built lives in Britain, felt it was our home – and then, without us having any say, you suddenly changed the rules. The words they use to describe how they feel are invariably the same: forgotten, lost, abandoned, unprotected, unwelcome, betrayed, belittled, voiceless. Many were asked when they would leave. Most believed that in future some degree of discrimination – over jobs, housing, healthcare, bank accounts – was inevitable. But returning to the EU has not always been easy. So yes, there are things about Britain they miss. Though they have also lost their illusions of what Britain was. The most succinct summary she has heard, says Remigi, goes like this: “Farewell, Britain. You were once good to me. And then you weren’t.” Candela thinks her experience is a common one. “Come to England, find a job, meet someone, get married, have children,” she says. “Then wake up one morning, see the result of the vote, and realise everything has changed. Leave. There are many like me, aren’t there?” She still believes Britain is a tolerant country. “I always thought it,” she says. “Perhaps this is a hiccup of history. Maybe Britain has just stepped back to move forward. What I do know is the day I left was the saddest of my life.” Candela spent 23 years in Britain, coming first to study English, then working for a Japanese trading company. She married a Japanese man in insurance, and raised two children, now aged 15 and 20. “We bought a house in Orpington,” she says. “It was our home. The day we left, 4 August 2017, I cried so many tears. I feel emotional talking about it even now. I have kept a photograph of it, all emptied.” Brexit was “such a shock. British people always seemed so respectful of foreigners. And the vote brought everything out that was hidden. All this pride in being British, this dislike of other cultures, all in the open.” The morning after, taking her daughter to school, she recalls other parents “looking at the floor. People who knew me.” They looked guilty, she remembers. “A remainer friend came round and announced, ‘We love you.’ Very dramatic. Lots of people said, ‘It’s not against you.’ I thought: but it’s against people like me.” What also changed, she says, is that she started “wondering about people. Which way they’d voted. I’d never thought that way before. Comments you wouldn’t have thought about twice, you started noticing.” Just over a year after the vote, her then husband (they separated a few months ago) was offered a job in Spain, and took it. “He was over the moon,” she says. “The sun, the food … He wasn’t very happy in England.” For Candela, there was “a reverse culture shock”. She was “feeling sad that my country isn’t capable of doing that much better. The whole Catalan independence thing kicked off as we arrived – the same issues, a divisive referendum, all over again. It wasn’t easy.” Now she is working in Barcelona, for a startup. Although her children are British nationals, her son just told her: “Mum, wherever I go, I’ll be a foreigner.” Her daughter is studying at Goldsmiths, and happy; she at least feels at home. Candela misses “London’s multiculturalism. Proper customer service. Green trees. Not the weather. Not the food. And I wouldn’t go back.” “There are mixed feelings, but no regrets,” says Mammone. Now a senior researcher in contemporary history at the Sapienza University of Rome, for the past 10 years he was at Royal Holloway, University of London. An expert on the far right, nationalism and European politics, Mammone, whose first experience of Britain was an Erasmus year in Bath in 1999, watched the Brexit process unfold with an interest that was as much professional as personal. He got it half wrong, half right. “On the one hand, I thought the leave campaign did not look like it was winning,” he says. “On the other, I was absolutely certain, looking at what the Conservatives were saying, that if it did, it would be a disaster.” There are lots of people like Mammone in UK universities, “people who came for this very open British system, this rich exchange of ideas, this great multicultural welcoming of foreign minds”. Now, he says, “many are leaving. You see a difference of approach. It feels like certain topics or themes are becoming almost out of bounds. A kind of nationalism has come back. Add in the marketisation of higher education in the UK, and the universities are not what they were.” Professionally, Mammone says, he could see this was “demagogy in action. The Brexiters’ analysis was so poor; it was clear they could never deliver all they promised. We used to talk about British pragmatism, but leaving Europe actually brings Britain closer to the populist politics of parts of the continent.” Personally, he feels “a sort of betrayal. Like a rejection of the European identity. It was a shock when it happened, certainly. Politically, culturally, Britain showed a different face. It no longer considered me a citizen. I had no reason to stay – not family, not the weather, not the food. It was not special any more.” Mammone does miss London. “Or at least, a nostalgic, romantic vision of London – dynamism and greenery. But I was back for a month this autumn and it’s changed. In Italy there’s a kind of post-pandemic renaissance under way; London feels the opposite. Every day I am more sure I made the right choice.” After 19 years in Britain, Joke Qureshi has come to spell her name as it’s pronounced in Dutch: Yoka. It’s also the name of the new band she has formed with her British husband, Ray, a year after returning to the Netherlands. “It hasn’t all been easy,” she says. “I felt like a foreigner in my own country: so much was the same, so much completely different. I didn’t know how things worked. We felt lonely at times, often misunderstood.” She was disappointed, too, to discover escaping Brexit did not mean escaping some of what drove it. “All the ‘our country is full’ rhetoric, the idea that immigrants are taking people’s jobs, that they are the cause of the housing shortage, only after ‘our’ money – that exists here, too,” she says. Qureshi landed in London in 2002, aged 29, from Amsterdam. She found a job in a pub, then as a recruiter, then in a travel agency, and spent her weekends gigging. Ray, who drives trucks for a day job, joined the band as a guitarist in 2011. She studied for a social policy degree from the Open University, volunteered with a youth offenders service, and eventually became a special educational needs teacher, a job she loved. In August 2016, weeks after the referendum, they moved to Kent. “There were still leave posters everywhere,” she says. “In the pub, people would just assume we agreed with them. I felt nervous, unsure what to say. But when we went to see my mum in the Netherlands, everything just felt so easy. I felt like I belonged. Like I didn’t have to pretend. Ray loved it, too.” When they finally decided to move, in June 2020, it was a scramble: Ray needed to be resident in the Netherlands before the end of the transition period or face a series of complications, including a Dutch language test. But everything fell into place. Before they left, Qureshi found a job in youth care; Ray started driving trucks as soon as they arrived. They found a home with a garden and a workshop for Ray’s hobby, guitar-making. The pandemic hasn’t made life easier, but they feel on track, Qureshi says. The band is on; a social life beckons. “I miss my friends, I miss my old teaching job, I miss the British blues scene, which was so warm,” she says. “I miss nice Brits. Ray really misses a good curry. But I’m happy we left.” English was Ollivier-Minns’ worst subject at school, which is why she came to Britain in 1986, aged 19, to improve it. “I honestly thought I would spend the rest of my life there,” she says. “I loved that country. I embraced the culture. It really was home.” In more than three decades in the UK, she worked as an au pair, an auxiliary nurse, a French teacher and, finally, as a sculptor, living first in London, then near Great Yarmouth, and – for 24 years – in a “big house with a lovely garden” in Norwich. She married a Briton (“a good man”) and had two children, now 24 and 27. In September 2018 she moved back to a one-bed house near Nantes, where she grew up and has family and friends. “I had to leave,” she says. “The weight of Brexit became so enormous. The division, the apathy, the sense of betrayal. I couldn’t stay. It became almost physical.” Her last two years in Britain were “suffocating, unbearable”. The architects of Brexit “stole my friends”, she says – they felt uneasy about the vote and kept their distance afterwards. Brexit also “robbed me of my beautiful home: it no longer felt like home. They tarnished the British values we shared, and soiled me in the process. They left me feeling unsafe.” Ollivier-Minns didn’t trust the EU settlement scheme. “I could see the discrimination coming, that dangerous ‘us v them’,” she says. “I had to get out.” Brexit also cost her her marriage. “I fell out of love with the country, then I fell out of love with my husband. So after more than 30 years together, we divorced when I returned to France. It was immensely stressful.” Rebuilding a new life in France after so long away, wrestling with the bureaucracy and doing up a new home have proved “a huge challenge, but also a distraction”. She has a lot less money. “I ended November with €35 in the bank,” she says. “I miss my children most. They’re British; they don’t feel in the least French. That’s the biggest sacrifice, a huge sacrifice. I miss English pubs. I miss PG Tips. I miss speaking English – I love this language. I was missing it so much I set up an English conversation group here.” Yet she remains angry. “I still care about Britain, but the deep feeling of betrayal won’t leave,” she says. “I’m disgusted by what happened, by what’s still happening. But I’m happier out of it. I had to look after myself. There’s no price for freedom and security.” Aichbauer headed back to her native Austria in October last year, with a British partner and daughter in tow. “It was a relief,” she says. “I could have stayed, made the most of it. But I’m so grateful Craig wanted to leave too.” An inveterate traveller, Aichbauer arrived in the UK in 2001, aged 28, in pursuit of an Irishman she fell for on a motorbike tour of India. She settled in Brighton, working at a museum cafe to fund more road trips. She met Craig in 2009 and travelled around Asia with him for 14 months. Then she became pregnant with Judith, and moved in with Craig’s mother in the Fens. Later they bought a home of their own near Wisbech in Cambridgeshire. “I trained as a baby swimming teacher and pregnancy yoga instructor, and loved it,” she says. “Craig did warehouse shifts, then found work as a plumber. We had a whole life there. A happy life.” The referendum was “devastating”. Craig’s whole family had voted leave. The pub no longer felt so friendly. “I got a few ‘When are you going home?’ comments, and I just thought, I don’t have to do this,” Aichbauer says. “Craig was very honest,” she says. “He just said he didn’t have the guts.” But then Covid shut down her workplace, and in May 2020 Aichbauer took Judith to Austria for six weeks. “We had the best time ever,” she says. “We called Craig every day. But it was an English friend who convinced him. He said it was clear where Britain was heading.” She won’t easily forget the date. “The sixth of July. He called, said he’d spoken to the estate agent, that the house was on the market. From then on, things went really fast.” (They had to move quickly: as with the other British partners of EU nationals, Craig needed to be in Austria before the end of the transition period.) They were lucky: Aichbauer’s big old family home, now owned by her sister, was mostly used for holiday lets, so they were able to stay. In the Alps, where Austria, Italy and Slovenia meet, most jobs are seasonal, but Aichbauer has found permanent work as an assistant to the local vet, and Craig is working as a plumber. Judith is loving school. “I have no regrets,” Aichbauer says. “I miss my job, my lovely colleagues. Craig struggles a bit with the winter, the sheer weight of the snow. But you look where Britain’s heading now and you think, I wouldn’t have been true to myself if I’d stayed.” Pavelková is back where she began, in Prague, and there’s not a lot she misses about the country that was her home for 15 years. “I’m not a big tea-drinker,” she says. “I do miss the openness, the tolerance – at least, I miss my idea of Britain as it was, before Brexit.” Pavelková left for the UK after graduating from vet school in the Czech Republic in 2006. She found work in Lancashire; it was hard to begin with. But after a spell travelling, she returned in 2010, settling in Cheshire, qualifying as a veterinary cardiologist in 2014, then working in an animal hospital in Manchester. “I think I was a bit naive about Brexit,” she says. “I didn’t think anyone would be so stupid as to vote leave. But I started to worry as the referendum neared, and people around me started saying they would.” The outcome was, Pavelková says, “a life-changing event. It completely threw me. I panicked about the implications – for my job, my work, free movement. It was clear EU citizens would never have the same status, that the country wouldn’t be the same.” She overheard a nurse telling a colleague she had voted out “because I don’t like the immigrants”. A neighbour asked when she was leaving. A client who brought his dog in was proudly sporting an “I voted leave” T-shirt. “The whole atmosphere was different,” Pavelková says. She applied for permanent residency in the UK – before realising she didn’t qualify because she had not had private health insurance while she was studying. Then, in 2018, she met her British husband, Stuart. “I’d calmed down a bit by then,” Pavelková says. “But neither of us felt our future was in the UK. Neither of us liked where the country was going. We decided to leave in January 2020, and we knew we’d have to be gone by the end of the year.” Pavelková applied for British citizenship. She says: “I’m not proud of having dual nationality; it was necessary just to keep the rights I already had.” But last December the couple moved to Prague. She has set up her own veterinary cardiology practice, and Stuart, an environmental officer in the UK, is working from home. Pavelková has returned a few times since then for locum stints, but has mixed feelings. “I do miss my colleagues; we’re a small, close, very friendly community,” she says. “I love seeing my friends and family. But Britain has changed. Life is cheaper here in Prague, and easier. The quality of life’s better. We’re happier.”",News/Politics,"Pubs, curry, PG Tips … but not the weather!

1/29/2022,"A couple heading off on holiday to Madeira were refused permission to board their plane on the grounds that the woman’s passport was not valid – even though it had another nine months left on it. Pat Cerely, 79, and her 83-year-old husband, Peter, are the latest holidaymakers to be caught up in confusion over Brexit-related rules that mean many people with up to 12 months left on their passport could be stopped from travelling to a long list of EU countries.  Since January 2021 restrictions limiting how long non-EU citizens can spend in mainland Europe have meant that UK holidaymakers can only enter a country if they have at least three months left on their passport. Rules that for non-EU citizens a passport must be within 10 years of its issue date when the holder arrives also apply. In November, the couple were told they could not set off on their trip because Pat’s passport did not meet new rules. The Cerelys arrived at Gatwick airport, checked in their luggage and then went through passport control with no problems. “We duly went to get on the plane, and when the girl looked at my passport, she said I couldn’t board as it wasn’t valid,” Pat says. “There was another couple there experiencing the same problem. Although my passport didn’t expire until August 2022, she said it wasn’t valid.” However, a close read of EU rules suggests the UK government, and some travel companies, are giving out incorrect information, and some people are being wrongly denied permission to travel. The passport matter revolves around the date the document was issued. According to the UK government and her airline, easyJet, Pat was correctly denied boarding but the EU regulations – as communicated to Guardian Money this week – would appear to show she should have been allowed on the flight. The European Commission says there are two rules that have to be complied with at the point of entry. The passport must have been issued within the previous 10 years, and it must be valid for at least three months after the day you plan to leave. However, the 10-year requirement “does not extend for the duration of the intended stay. It is enough if this condition is fulfilled at the moment of entry”. It says this means that a Briton arriving in an EU country on 1 December 2021 for a 20-day holiday with a passport issued on 2 December 2011 and valid until 2 April 2022 would be allowed entry. The validity date is the expiry date, not the 10th anniversary of the passport being issued, and if you are on holiday in Europe when your passport “busts” the 10-year rule, that is fine. The different dates exist because for many years those renewing their passport before the previous one expired were able to add any remaining time left. Until September 2018 you could have up to nine months added to an adult or child’s passport in this way. If you have a trip booked or are thinking about one, dig out everyone’s passport now to check the dates. Check the date of issue and the date of expiry. Pat Cerely’s passport was renewed in December 2011 but has an expiry date of August 2022. The Cerelys had to return home with their bags after being denied boarding for their break. “We had to wait some time for our luggage and then go through the passport control exit. This all took place at 7am,” she says. Peter has dementia and she adds: “It was all very depressing and confusing for him.” When they got home, Pat contacted the travel firm they had used to book the holiday and was told it was very unlikely they would receive a refund. “I also contacted our insurance company, who said that we couldn’t make a claim as I should have read the small print! Since then we have had a refund of £35.47, which is the air tax,” she says. “What I don’t understand is why didn’t easyJet inform me when I booked the flights, and why a friend who visited his sister in December and had the same expiry date on his passport as me was allowed to fly to Portugal with easyJet with no problem.” The EU rules suggest the Cerelys have a case for obtaining a refund and compensation on the grounds of being unfairly denied boarding. The UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office says it is “seeking clarification” from the European Commission about the rule. The Gov.uk site tells would-be travellers that “for some Schengen countries, your passport may need to be less than 10 years old during your whole visit, and the three months at the end of your visit may need to be within 10 years of your passport’s issue date”. The rules for travel changed a year ago, yet the commission says it was discussing this issue with member states during 2021, and “this advice will be reflected in an upcoming update of the practical handbook for border guards”. In a statement, easyJet told us that at the time of the flight taken by the Cerelys, the UK Foreign Office requirements stated that the three-month validity on the day of departure from Portugal must be within 10 years of the passport issue date, and added: “Unfortunately, her passport didn’t meet this criteria.” A spokesperson said: “We do specifically inform customers to check passport validity requirements ahead of departure, both at the time of booking and ahead of their flight via email. “We would like to apologise to these passengers for any inconvenience caused; however, we were following the government guidance at the time.” The days of travel insurers offering next to no cancellation and other Covid-related cover are mostly over but you should still check potential policies closely before you hand over your credit card details. Cover for those forced to cancel because a member of their party contracts the coronavirus has been restored to most of the better, popular policies. However, you really need to check the small print, particularly if you are unvaccinated. For example, the popular Staysure requires policyholders to be vaccinated to gain its Covid cover. The rival Direct Line does not. There are still a host of get-outs to contend with. Direct Line will not pay out if you have to cancel because you have to self-isolate when you return. Other insurers will have similar caveats that you will want to be aware of. If you rely on an annual policy either bought or one that comes via your paid-for bank account, it is worth looking at the insurer’s latest position, which may have changed since you last (tried to) book a trip. If you do not have an annual policy, buy the policy as soon as you book the trip. That way you will be covered if the airline collapses (assuming you have scheduled airline failure cover) or something happens to one of your party before you travel. Again, check exactly how much your chosen policy will pay out before you buy. For example, Staysure’s basic policy only offers £500 to cover cancellation, meaning you will want to opt for its comprehensive cover (up to £5,000) if you have pushed the boat out and booked an expensive trip. Other insurers have similarly different levels of cover, and the more you pay the greater the cover. Vodafone is leading the way with a £2-a-day charge (or a bundled £15 for 15 days) to use its package “as at home” in Europe, and will start applying the fee to bills on 31 January. In the short-term it only applies to customers who upgraded or changed their payment plan on or after 11 August 2021. EE has delayed resuming its £2-a-day roaming charges, which were planned for January, until March. Three is bringing in roaming charges between the UK and Europe in May 2022. O2 and Virgin Mobile have said they will maintain their inclusive roaming in the EU bloc, so their customers can travel and use their data, calls and texts just as they would in the UK.

1/29/2022,"Perhaps the only thing surprising about “Operation Red Meat”, Boris Johnson’s recent attempt to deflect attention from the ongoing partygate scandal, is that it flopped. The flurry of policy announcements made in mid-January – from putting the military in charge of dealing with Channel crossings by small boats to threatening the BBC’s licence fee – display the rightwing populist instinct that has been central to Johnson’s leadership of the Conservative party. In the past, announcements such as these might have been enough to keep Conservative grassroot campaigners, MPs, voters and sympathetic media outlets onside. This time, it has done nothing to quell the crisis – and Johnson’s approval rating has continued to plunge dramatically. The immediate cause of failure is obvious: the attempt to placate the right by throwing out some “red meat” was cynical and half-hearted. But whether Johnson stays or goes, there are wider political shifts under way that may make populist posturing a less effective tool for the government in the years to come.  A new study from the University of Cambridge suggests that worldwide, voters’ enthusiasm for populism has been on the wane since the beginning of the pandemic. The populist leaders who gathered steam in the mid-2010s and came mainly from the right or far-right are experiencing a steady decline in support, according to a survey of polling data in 27 countries. Authoritarian strongmen who tried to downplay the threat of Covid, such as Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, are in particular trouble due to their mishandling of the pandemic. But the researchers found that attitudes among voters are shifting more broadly, with less support for ideas central to populism, such as a belief in the “will of the people”, or a tendency to see politics as a conflict between the people and a corrupt elite. The researchers attribute this in part to what they call the “rally around the flag” effect of the pandemic: people have been more likely to put their trust in national institutions and technical experts, or place a greater emphasis on social solidarity, in our collective efforts to suppress the virus. This, however, has come at a price. The study also found a “disturbing erosion of support for core democratic beliefs and principles, including less liberal attitudes with respect to basic civil rights and liberties”. There may be less appetite for populist tub-thumping, but if anything, suggests the research, the pandemic has left people more open to having the state order them around. This should be of particular concern in the UK, where a key part of the Johnson government’s programme has been to attack civil liberties. By now, we are familiar with the series of bills making their way through parliament that seek to curtail people’s rights – the right to protest or to seek asylum; the right of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities to live without harassment from the state; or of people with immigrant backgrounds to live securely in the UK – but it’s worth pausing to consider why these issues have become so politically dominant. As the Cambridge researchers state: “When people feel existentially threatened, they are likely to endorse illiberal attitudes across a broader spectrum of beliefs.” The rightwing populist wave of recent years has relied on linking people’s discontent at the political system to the false claim that majority populations are threatened by immigrants and other outsiders. These populists – or, in the case of the UK government, a centre-right party that has taken on a populist hue – have offered to restore a sense of security through clamping down on perceived threats, and taking power away from the checks and balances of liberal democracy that they portray as tools of the elite. Fading support for populism may eventually lead to a shift in the tone of political debate, but the changes the government’s new laws bring will be profound and long-lasting – and harder to roll back if people’s desire for security outweighs other concerns. As a new report by the Institute of Race Relations thinktank points out, a common thread running through the new laws is that not only do they target our rights, but they seek to make the state and its officials less accountable. The government’s proposed reforms to the Human Rights Act, for instance, which would place new obstacles in the way of human rights claims in the courts, threaten to limit our ability to seek justice from the state. The barrister and author David Renton notes that the Human Rights Act has been of vital importance to many different groups in society, from the Hillsborough families to tenants fighting eviction. At the same time, we have given the state far greater power over our lives in the service of suppressing the pandemic, an issue that becomes more ethically complex as the emergency recedes. Look, for instance, at how swiftly the idea that unvaccinated people should be denied or given less priority for medical treatment has entered political debate in the UK and elsewhere in recent months. If we do not challenge these trends now, then the UK risks becoming a place where ordinary people have less of a voice, and less ability to hold the country’s institutions to account. Making that challenge is no easy prospect. “Civil liberties” can often seem like a dry, abstract concept, and it cuts across conventional political distinctions. The left has a tendency to regard civil liberties as something of a sideshow – a distraction from “real” issues such as economic inequality – while liberals can sometimes treat the issue as apolitical, merely a matter to be settled by the courts. Rightwing “libertarians”, meanwhile, are often highly selective about the liberties they are willing to defend. Ultimately, the response must be to make these issues central to other political debates, so they are not dismissed as more immediate problems such as the cost of living crisis come to dominate our attention. For example, the government also announced this week that sanctions for jobseekers on universal credit will be made much tougher. It is tempting to see this as purely an economic question: should benefits be more generous, or less? But it is also fundamentally about the way the state is allowed to treat individuals, and what tools we have to push back against our treatment. Over the past decade, cuts to legal aid have made it much more difficult for people without private wealth to dispute what they think are unfair decisions in the benefits system. Ensuring the right to challenge the state would also be a way to help people win economic security for themselves. In the short term, however, it’s important to recognise that there are still effective ways to counteract the government, as the partial victories against the policing bill in the House of Lords earlier this month suggest. There, a cross-party alliance of peers voted down some of the more egregious proposals to restrict the right to protest, but the campaign against the bill would not have gained momentum without the efforts of radical and liberal activists outside parliament, who have been raising the alarm on the streets and in their communities for months. This is an uneasy alliance – the interests and priorities of the groups involved will not always align – but finding points in common is an essential first step to wider change.

1/29/2022,"Shooting with an iPhone, says French photographer Frédéric Noy, is like “mild psychotherapy. Sometimes, you get stuck. Taking a few pictures with an iPhone is like a liberation. A reset, a moment of reflection. You see things differently.” Noy arrived in Nur-Sultan, the capital of Kazakhstan, mid-pandemic, after many years in Africa, where he had documented the daily lives of persecuted LGBTQ+ Ugandans; he had won World Press Photo and Visa d’Or awards for his work on the environmental disaster in Lake Victoria. “I wanted to go somewhere as distant and as different as possible,” he says. “Kazakhstan was the last country to leave the USSR, and it’s still constructing its identity. That’s what interested me. All I knew about it was cliche.”  He took this photo in early May 2021, when, on the last day of term, pupils, their teachers and some parents placed flowers on the statue of Aliya Moldagulova, a Kazakh-born sniper who died of battle wounds in 1944 and was made a hero of the Soviet Union. “Like Russia, they celebrate Victory Day here on 9 May,” Noy says. “The shot intrigues me because the school uniforms look almost like the Red Army. In a country that only became independent in 1991, when the Kazakhs were a minority in their homeland, there’s a clear tension between the national and the Soviet identity.” It’s part of what he calls his project scrapbook. “I rarely take the same pictures with my phone and with my cameras,” he says. “The intention is very different. It’s like a sketch, I suppose. I feel sometimes I’m not the same photographer.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘The Kazakh school uniforms look like the Red Army’ – Frédéric Noy’s best phone picture ,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/29/the-kazakh-school-uniforms-look-like-the-red-army-frederic-noys-best-phone-picture
1/29/2022,"It’s an annual tradition as ingrained as throwing Gatorade on the winning coach: the moment when the Super Bowl half-time performer takes to the stage and the football field is filled with “fans” cheering them on. The Los Angeles Times reported last week that those audience members are in fact hundreds of unpaid “volunteers” who participate in nearly two weeks of rehearsals ahead of the Super Bowl, many of whom are trained dancers recruited from the same agency that represents the paid dancers on the halftime show stage.  The arrangement is now under scrutiny after Taja Riley, a professional dancer, who called out the people behind the nation’s highest-grossing sporting event for not paying the trained dancers used in the show. She accused the NFL and Roc Nation, who are producing the half-time show, for exploiting the labor of mostly Black artists. Riley, who has been paid to perform in two previous half-time shows, said the unpaid dancers are treated as volunteers but are required to attend nine days of nine-hour rehearsals. While she hasn’t been privy to this year’s preparations, Riley said that at the previous Super Bowls she participated in, “the schedules those volunteers were given, and what they were coaxed into … they will be doing more than just acting as ‘concertgoers’”. This year, the call for volunteers went out to dancers represented by Bloc, the same agency that represents Fatima Robinson, who is choreographing the performance. Riley was tipped off about the recruitment of dance artists for unpaid work. She said she was surprised because Robinson is someone she admired and looked up to not just as a dance artist but one of the “African-American leaders for our community”. “She’s done what I hope to do, of having the esteem and deepened relationship with other artistic collaborators,” Riley said. Robinson, who has worked closely with some of the biggest names in hip-hop, including Pharrell Williams and Kendrick Lamar, has defended this year’s half-time show, saying the 115 paid dancers are the highest number of dancers to be paid to perform in a Super Bowl, and that the only thing required of the volunteers is that they be able to “walk and chew gum at the same time”. That dismissive characterization of the expectations of the volunteers is incongruous with what others have said is being demanded of them. If it were the case, then why not simply pick anyone off the street rather than recruit trained dancers? Regardless, even extras on a typical union job are paid for what truly can amount to simply “walking and chewing gum”. “If they are just ‘concertgoers’,” Riley asked, “why would they have an excessive schedule like this? For award shows, they file in the day of and are just fine with one full day of rehearsal before the show. What would be reasonable is two days, not nine. If they are really just there to be concertgoers, they should really only have, maximum, an eight hour work-week.” This year’s show involves pyrotechnics, which Riley and another dancer, Devyck Bull, who was booked as a paid dancer for this year’s performance, said is one justification for the intense rehearsal requirements – and also a reason why people should be both trained and fairly compensated. Bull replied to Riley’s social media post, saying he was hired to perform at a previous half-time show, he’d discovered that a large number of performers weren’t being paid, and were under the impression that no one was. “It just didn’t sit well with me,” Bull said. Bull felt he was “less experienced about speaking up”, but when he saw Riley’s post, he felt he was able to go public. After he shared what he’d heard in comments on Riley’s Instagram, other dancers told him he was making a mistake, and was going to end up “blacklisted”. Bull said they were right: the next day, he was told he’d been cut from the half-time show. Bull received an email from someone at Bloc on 20 January telling him that the agency had “just received an update and unfortunately they will no longer be needing you for the half-time performance”. The agency representative told Bull he’d be notified “if anything changes”. Bloc did not respond to a request for comment. Nor did the NFL or Roc Nation, which produces the half-time show. As freelance contractors, dance artists lack mechanisms like unions that could allow them to organize and operate in solidarity with one another in these situations, Riley said. However, when she gets a job, she tries to find someone else who is hired on it, and get a group chat going to coordinate who has what supplies, what everyone is bringing, and other logistical necessities. That kind of communication could allow everyone to get on the same page. And if the paid dancers were willing to stand together, it could make a difference for the larger number of unpaid dancerssome of whom have 10 years of professional dance experience. Roc Nation and Sag Aftra have suggested since Riley spoke out that some sort of “agreement” was reached between the production company and the union, with Sag Aftra praising the payment of 100 dancers and saying they’re advising their members not to accept the volunteer positions. But it’s not clear that anything has actually changed since Riley first brought attention to the issue: there are still only 100 people getting paid, and 400 expected to pay to give up nearly two weeks of their time. “This is not just for the Super Bowl, this is for every industry gig,” Riley said. “These are really hard questions that there’s maybe no right or wrong answer to, but there may be an ethical and unethical answer.”",Sport/Sport, Super Bowl half-time arrangement under scrutiny over unpaid ‘volunteers’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/29/super-bowl-half-time-show-dancers-volunteers-unpaid
1/29/2022,"On the morning of 6 October the nine justices of the US supreme court filed into their wood-paneled courtroom in Washington to hear arguments in a dispute between the US government and Abu Zubaydah, a Guantánamo prisoner who has been held incommunicado and without charge for the past 20 years. A government lawyer addressed the panel, arguing on grounds of “state secrets” that Zubaydah should be blocked from calling two CIA contractors to testify about the brutal interrogations they put him through at a hidden black site in Poland. Within minutes of his opening remarks, the lawyer was interrupted by Amy Coney Barrett, one of the rightwing justices appointed to the court by Donald Trump.  Barrett wanted to know what the government would do were the contractors to give evidence before a domestic US court about how they had “waterboarded” Zubaydah at least 83 times, beat him against a wall, hung him by his hands from cell bars and entombed him naked in a coffin-sized box for 266 hours. “You know,” she said, “the evidence of how he was treated and his torture.” “Torture.” Barrett said the word almost nonchalantly, but its significance ricocheted around the courtroom and far beyond. By using the word she had effectively acknowledged that what was done by the CIA to Zubaydah, and to at least 39 other “war on terror” detainees in the wake of 9/11, was a crime under US law. After Barrett uttered the word the floodgates were opened. “Torture” echoed around the nation’s highest court 20 times that day, pronounced by Barrett six times and once by another of Trump’s conservative nominees, Neil Gorsuch, with liberal justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan also piling in. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/05/05-61553-gnl.fw.200505.jf.ch7DW.mp3 The flurry of plain speaking by justices on both ideological wings of the court amazed observers of America’s long history of duplicity and evasion on this subject. “The way the supreme court justices used the word ‘torture’ was remarkable,” Andrea Prasow, a lawyer and advocate working to hold the US accountable for its counterterrorism abuses, told the Guardian. “You could feel the possibility that the ground is shifting.” Prasow was astonished a second time three weeks later when Majid Khan, a former al-Qaida courier also held in Guantánamo, became the first person to speak openly in court about the torture he suffered at a CIA black site. Khan’s description of being waterboarded, held in the nude and chained to the ceiling to the point that he began to hallucinate was so overpowering that seven of the eight members of his military jury wrote a letter pleading for clemency for him, saying his treatment was a “stain on the moral fiber of America”. The ground does appear to be shifting, and as it does attention is once again falling on one of the great unfinished businesses of the 21st century: the US torture program. In the panicky aftermath of 9/11, when the world seemed to be imploding, the CIA took the view that the ends – the search for actionable intelligence to thwart further terrorist attacks – justified any means. With the enthusiastic blessing of the justice department and George W Bush’s White House, the CIA abandoned American values and violated international and US laws by adopting callous cruelties that they consciously copied from the enemy. They took one prisoner, Abu Zubaydah, and made him their experimental guinea pig. On Zubaydah’s back they built an entire edifice of torture – “enhanced interrogation techniques” as the bloodless euphemism went – that in turn was founded upon a mountain of lies. When the worst of the torture was completed, to spare themselves from possible prosecution the CIA insisted that Zubaydah remain “in isolation and incommunicado for the remainder of his life”. “The torture program was designed for only one person – they gave him a name and that name was Abu Zubaydah,” Mark Denbeaux, Zubaydah’s lead habeas lawyer, told the Guardian. “After they tortured him, they demanded that he be held incommunicado forever so that his story could never be told. Since that moment the only people he has ever spoken to are his torturers, his jailers, and his lawyers, including me.” Twenty years after Zubaydah was waterboarded, slammed repeatedly against a wall, sleep-deprived, face slapped, chained in painful stress positions, hosed with freezing water, stripped naked, and blasted with deafening noise, his story still has not fully been told. In 2014 the Senate intelligence committee released a heavily redacted, 500-page executive summary of its seven-year investigation into the torture program, generating headlines around the world and leading Barack Obama to conclude that “these harsh methods were not only inconsistent with our values, they did not serve our national security”. Yet at the insistence of the CIA the full report from which the summary was drawn remains under lock and key to this day. All three volumes of it. All more than 6,700 pages. All 38,000 footnotes. All the detail distilled from 6.2m pages of classified CIA documents. The persistent refusal to release the full Senate torture report has left a black hole at the centre of one of the most shameful episodes in US history. Now, with the T-word being heard even in the hallowed halls of the US supreme court, renewed calls are being made for the report to be published so that this sorry chapter can finally be closed. Several of the individuals most closely involved in the battle for the truth over Abu Zubaydah’s treatment have told the Guardian that 20 years is long enough. It is time for the American people to be told the full unadulterated facts about what was done in their name. “More than seven years after the completion of the torture investigation, it remains critically important that the public see the full report,” said Ron Wyden, the Democratic senator from Oregon who was an important advocate for the Senate investigation and who played a critical role in ensuring that at least some of its findings have emerged into daylight. Wyden called for a full accounting of the CIA’s handling of detainees. He said a wealth of information still shrouded in secrecy would confirm that the torture program was ineffective – it simply didn’t work. “The withholding of the full report, and the redactions in the public executive summary, have hidden from the public the story of how the program was developed and operated. Understanding how all of this happened is important because it must never happen again.” Daniel Jones, the chief author of the US Senate report, said that now was the moment for its release. “The country is ready. It’s what you do in a transparent democracy: when you mess up you admit it and you move on as a better country. We’ve reached that point now.” Abu Zubaydah, 50, (actual name Zayn al-Abidin Muhammad Husayn) is a Saudi-born Palestinian who was one of the CIA’s “high-value” targets in the wake of 9/11. He was captured in Faisalabad, Pakistan, on 28 March 2002 in a raid in which he was shot several times including in the thigh and groin. He later lost his left eye while in US custody in unexplained circumstances. John Kiriakou, a former CIA counter-terrorism officer, was a leading member of the team that seized Zubaydah, sitting guard at the prisoner’s bedside after the raid. Though Kiriakou did not participate in the prisoner’s subsequent interrogations at secret black sites in Thailand, Poland, Lithuania and other countries, he continued to keep tabs on his captive. In December 2007, having by then left the CIA, Kiriakou gave an interview to NBC News in which he became the first former government official publicly to state that Zubaydah had been waterboarded – the process where a cloth is placed over a detainee’s face and water poured over it as a form of controlled drowning. Kiriakou declared that he had come to view the procedure as torture. Kiriakou’s comments marked the first chink in the wall of official silence surrounding the CIA’s abuses. The move displeased his former employers and he was made the subject of a leak inquiry that ended in a sentence of 23 months in a federal penitentiary – he is convinced as an act of revenge – ostensibly for having revealed the identity of a covert CIA agent to a journalist. Unbeknownst to him at the time, Kiriakou in fact gave erroneous information in his NBC News interview. He said Zubaydah had been waterboarded only once and that the detainee had instantly cracked, divulging good actionable intelligence in less than a minute. In fact, the prisoner was waterboarded not once but at least 83 times over more than a month. After the torture began in earnest at “detention site green” in Thailand in August 2002, the CIA gleaned no valuable information from Zubaydah whatsoever. Kiriakou told the Guardian that his remarks to NBC had been based on what he picked up at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. “This was all a lie and we didn’t know it was a lie until it was declassified in 2009. So on top of being illegal, unethical and immoral, it was also false.” To Kiriakou, the supreme court’s ease with the word “torture” 14 years after he used it for the first time on network television is “vindication that it was wrong”. He said he was dismayed that the CIA continues to cover up its “barbaric crimes” by resisting release of the full Senate report, likening the study to the defense department’s internal account of the Vietnam war that changed the course of history when it was leaked in 1971. “We knew a lot about what was happening in Vietnam but we didn’t have official government confirmation until Daniel Ellsberg released the Pentagon Papers. It’s the same here. We have had some testimony from torture victims but we don’t have official confirmation of what the CIA did from the CIA itself, and that’s what release of this report would do.” The lies to which Kiriakou fell foul were intrinsic to the torture program from its inception. Zubaydah was used as the prototype for a new type of “enhanced interrogation” that crossed the line into torture. In April 2002 a pair of psychologists, James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen, were brought on board by the CIA on contract to create the program. They based the plan partly on experiments on dogs that found if you hurt and humiliated the animals sufficiently, eventually they would stop resisting – “learned helplessness” as it was known in the trade. (At least in this regard the torture program proved successful – Zubaydah did reach such a place of helplessness. It got to the point that as soon as an interrogator snapped his fingers twice, the detainee would lie flat on the waterboard and wait supinely for the controlled drowning to begin.) The psychologists, whom the CIA paid more than $80m for their efforts, consciously modeled their interrogation methods on the so-called SERE training of American soldiers on how to resist torture were they to fall into enemy hands. The contractors openly adopted the enemy torture techniques, without irony, despite the fact that the methods were designed to extract propaganda statements from US prisoners of war and not accurate intelligence. Senior CIA officials knew that they faced an uphill battle in persuading the Department of Justice that what they planned to do was legal – after all torture was categorically prohibited under the 1949 Geneva Conventions that the US had ratified. So they presented the DoJ with a “psychological assessment” of Zubaydah justifying why he needed to be made to talk using aggressive interrogation methods, warning that “​countless more Americans may die unless we can persuade Zubaydah to tell us what he knows”. It was all a smorgasbord of lies. “The reasons they gave for why he had to be tortured were false and known to be false,” Denbeaux said. “The justice department was duped into approving the torture of a man who was never a member of al-Qaida. They said he was number two, three or four of al-Qaida – not true. They said he was part of 9/11 – laughable and not true. They said he was part of all al-Qaida operations around the world – totally untrue.” Denbeaux added that one of the most urgent arguments in favour of releasing the full Senate report was that it would expose the lies at the core of the program. “It would show in detail how the falsity was made up, and who in the CIA put these false facts together.” Zubaydah’s psychological profile was not the only aspect of the untruths that formed the building blocks of the torture program. The CIA was also misleading about the efficacy of “enhanced interrogation techniques”. Ali Soufan has personal knowledge of how distorted the official CIA account was. A former FBI special agent, he was one of the first US officials to interrogate Zubaydah at a black site. He did so using conventional interrogation methods that would be familiar to students of Law & Order. He learned everything he could about his subject, spoke in the prisoner’s own language (Arabic), built up a rapport with Zubaydah, and played mind games on him such as giving him the impression that the FBI knew much more about his activities than in fact they did. All without recourse to force, violence or humiliation. “We did not need torture to get information,” Soufan told the Guardian. Soufan and his FBI partner succeeded in securing Zubaydah’s cooperation and extracting significant intelligence from the prisoner, including the central role played by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed as the architect of 9/11. Even so, they were abruptly pulled off the job and replaced by the CIA contractors armed with a very different approach. Soufan watched aghast as CIA operatives, under the instruction of Mitchell and Jessen, began to torture the prisoner. “At the beginning it was mostly loud music,” Soufan said. “He was held naked in the cell. That shocked me at the time. It was stupid, why are we doing it, the guy is already giving information. And then it evolved, one step after another.” Starting at 11.50am on 4 August 2002, Zubaydah was tortured through a variety of methods, almost 24 hours a day, for 19 days without break. After a waterboarding session he was noted to have “involuntary leg, chest and arm spasms” and to be unable to communicate. On one occasion he became “completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth”. Given Zubaydah’s incommunicado status, he has never been allowed to recount his experiences directly to the American people. But over the years his lawyers have managed to put together notes in which the Guantánamo detainee describes his abuse. Excerpts of those notes, together with some of Zubaydah’s drawings that he sketched from memory in Guantánamo that illustrate his treatment at the CIA black sites, are being published by the Guardian. They amount to a harrowing account in Zubaydah’s own words and images of the relentless, round-the-clock, prolonged and illegal abuse he suffered. Soufan, who is now CEO of the Soufan Group, said the release of the full Senate report is essential to counter the CIA narrative, which he fears that too many Americans still believe – that torture works. “Most of the American public believe the Hollywood version: you beat someone up, they give you the information you want, you save lives.” Soufan added: “Release the full Senate report and you will see that the CIA shaped a false narrative. The torture did not work, it did not produce information that saved lives, it did hinder our counterterrorism operations and destroy our image and reputation around the world.” Soufan’s own experiences give some hope that the full Senate report might one day be made public. When his book on the war of terror, The Black Banners, was published in 2011 it was so heavily redacted by the CIA that he even had to black out any reference to himself including the words “I”, “me”, “our” and “we”. It took him a legal battle lasting nine years, but in 2020 he was finally able to bring out a declassified edition. Soufan hopes that the softening attitude of CIA chiefs towards his book bodes well for an eventual release of the Senate report. “The CIA is now a very different organization from what it was in 2002. The people who were directly involved in the torture program, they are all out and there is a new leadership who understand the impact of all this.” Kiriakou is more pessimistic about a CIA change of heart: “For the next 100 years the CIA will do anything it can to stop that report being made public.” The Guardian asked the CIA whether it had plans to revisit the question of whether the report could be published, and invited the agency to comment. It did not immediately respond. For all the uncertainty about the CIA’s intentions, calls for release of the full Senate report are growing. Prasow said that the US will find it all but impossible to close Guantánamo without grappling with the torture issue first. “The public has been sold a false story that torture victims were somehow less deserving of human rights protections. For far too long it’s been too easy to see torture victims as ‘other’. It’s time to bring them out into the light.” Denbeaux, Zubaydah’s lawyer, said that releasing the report would help fill in some of the void that was left in 2005 when the CIA destroyed videotapes of the torture of Zubaydah. “In the absence of the destroyed footage, the full Senate report would bring home to the American people the cumulative horror of how the torture worked, day after day, hour after hour, continuously, endlessly. This was a hideous awful thing, and they’d like us to forget about it?” Jones, the report’s chief author, said that were it to emerge in its totality it would “shut the book and remove any lingering doubts” – about the torture, about its ineffectiveness, and about the lies that were told. “There are so many examples in it of the CIA misleading Congress, the White House, the public.” Among the items still waiting to be revealed is a photograph that has never been made public that Jones and his team discovered of a waterboard that was stored at the notorious “Salt Pit”, a black site outside Bagram airbase in Afghanistan. The device appeared extremely well used, and in the photo it is seen surrounded by buckets of water and bottles of a peculiar pink solution. The photograph puzzled Jones and his team of investigators because there were no official records to indicate that waterboarding had ever been practiced at the Salt Pit. When the Senate team asked the CIA to explain the photograph, the agency said it had no answer. In the last analysis, Jones said that it all points to a massive failure of accountability – a failure that until the full report is made public will continue to gnaw away at the nation’s standing and self-respect. “We’ve failed at every level of accountability – criminal, civil and societal,” he said. “If this is never to happen again, there has to be a reckoning.”",News/US news,"The CIA lied to justify torturing one prisoner after 9/11. 20 years later, his story is still shrouded in secrecy",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/29/the-cia-lied-to-justify-torturing-one-prisoner-after-911-20-years-later-his-story-is-still-shrouded-in-secrecy
