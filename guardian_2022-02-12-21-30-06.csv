2/12/2022,"Italian rugby is surrounded by wolves. Not the nurturing sort, like the one that reared Rome’s mythological founders, Romulus and Remus, but sharp-toothed blood-drinkers in the guise of critical journalists and fans who have long lost patience with the Azzurri’s meagre contribution to Europe’s premier rugby union competition. The statistics support their howls to cut the straggler from the pack. Italy vindicated their inclusion in the Six Nations when they beat Scotland 34-20 in their inaugural outing in 2000, but have won just 11 of their subsequent 96 matches and in 21 seasons have finished last 16 times. They are on a 33-game losing streak stretching back to 2015 and last year broke records for most points conceded (239) and most tries conceded (34), finishing with the worst ever points difference of -184. They have never beaten England.  All signs point to a regression. And though the clamour to include Georgia has quietened, there is mounting momentum behind a bid to make room for South Africa. Facing the wall of gnashing teeth is a man who understands that time is against him. “We know we have to start pulling our weight,” says Kieran Crowley, a World Cup winner with New Zealand in 1987 who took charge of Italy last May. “I’m not against promotion-relegation. It might be a good thing. That’s a decision for the boardrooms. What I will say is that we can silence that chat with our own performances.” After serving as an All Black selector and then under-19s coach, in 2008 Crowley was appointed coach of Canada, staying in post for eight years. He then signed with Benetton, where he took the Treviso franchise to a first ever Pro14 quarter-final, losing by two points to Munster in 2019. Last year he broke new ground by winning the Rainbow Cup, an admittedly diluted tournament but the first international silverware lifted by an Italian club. Can Crowley’s minor success at Benetton help to break the losing cycle with the national side? “Sometimes it’s felt like it’s never going to end,” admits Sebastian Negri, the 27-year-old loose forward who was part of Crowley’s Benetton team. “We take it personally. But there are a few of us who now know what it means to win something. That can only have a positive impact.” In team meetings, Crowley has emphasised two words: respect and credibility. He believes that too few players have respected the jersey and that this has led to a depletion in Italy’s credibility as a tier-one nation. “There are only two professional franchises in Italy,” Crowley offers as a cause for this complacency. “If you play for Benetton or Zebre there’s a good chance you’ll get the call. Players haven’t had to fight like they have to in France or England.” To rectify this, Crowley is encouraging his players to seek employment abroad. But he has also made contact with three England-based players: the Harlequins wing Louis Lynagh, who was born in Italy, the Wasps wing Paolo Odogwu, who has Italian parents, and Alex Lozowski of Saracens, who last played for England in 2018 but could take advantage of World Rugby’s new eligibility laws through his Italian grandmother. “I’ll work with any player who is available and is good enough,” Crowley says. But change is slow. Of his squad of 33, only six play outside Italy – four in France and two in England. One of them is the 20-year-old Gloucester scrum-half Stephen Varney. Born in Wales to an Italian mother, he has roots in Cesena and Parma, and his great-grandfather served in the Italian army in North Africa during the second world war before he was captured and placed in a prison camp in west Wales. “It’s in the blood,” Varney says with a Welsh accent. “We’re passionate people. We’re aware of what others are saying. Kieran has called us out and to be honest we needed that. We want to prove we belong. We all want to be the generation that turned things around.” With an average age of 23, Italy’s is the youngest squad in the competition. Two of them are teenagers, including the wing Tommaso Menoncello, who scored against France on debut. Several have graduated from impressive youth groups that now regularly beat the other five nations. Paolo Garbisi is a standout. The 21-year-old fly-half has helped drive Montpellier to second in France’s Top 14 table, occasionally nudging Handré Pollard to inside centre. Italy’s captain, Michele Lamaro, will be 24 in June, leading a group not stained by what has come before. There are drawbacks to youth, of course. All told there are only 440 Test caps throughout the squad – that’s 186 fewer than Wales, who have seven established players out through injury. And while Crowley stresses the need for patience, he recognises the urgency of his situation. “We’ve got to get the monkey off our back, but we’re up against five of the best eight teams in the world with an inexperienced group,” he says. “It’s a chicken and egg thing with results. We’ve shown we can play well in patches. We just need to do it across the 80 minutes.” Italy kept New Zealand scoreless for almost half an hour in November before shipping four tries in the final quarter. They led France twice in the first half last week but faded in the second, losing 37-10. Even an improved performance will probably not be enough against Eddie Jones and his wounded England on Sunday. The wolves will continue to howl. Only a win will make them go away.",Sport/Sport,Italy must justify their presence with good showing against England,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/12/italy-england-six-nations-preview-kieran-crowley
2/12/2022,"Bobbing across choppy black waters towards land, we reach a rocky shore, infertile but for a few sad palm trees. Only in the bewitchings of Handel’s sorceress-chatelaine does the island become a mirage of lush green whorls and juicy succulents. Opera North’s new Alcina, directed by Tim Albery, opens with this striking imagery on a film backdrop. Throughout, the visual device works hard to provide the magic in Handel’s fantasy tale of 1735. The company describes this as its “first sustainable mainstage production”, an important milestone, if not entirely successful in result. The main props are blue velvet club-style chairs and a lighting rig that rises and falls as required. Two sorceresses – Alcina and her sister Morgana – lure susceptible men into their domain. Quickly bored, Alcina wizards her rejected lovers into animals, stones and trees. (The programme note explains, lest any were unsure, that this is a metaphor.)  In the opera’s twisting plot, nearly everyone is someone else or thinks they might be. Disguise and cross-dressing or undressing dominate the action. Deciding how to present Handel for today’s audiences is an endless directorial challenge. Two weeks ago, the fuss was about Katie Mitchell throwing a capacious feminist veil over Handel’s Theodora at the Royal Opera House. Last week in Leeds the intervention was, if anything, more extreme. Hackles haven’t risen in the same way. Opera North’s media campaigns are quieter, and tend to let a piece speak for itself, though I found the results more problematic. The story has been reworked, one character excised altogether, another – the bass role of Melisso – now given to a mezzo-soprano as Melissa (effectively sung by Claire Pascoe). Cuts to the music were sanctioned by the conductor Laurence Cummings. As musical director of the London Handel festival, having recently completed his stint as artistic director with the authoritative Internationale Händel-Festspiele Göttingen, he doesn’t take such decisions lightly. Directing from the keyboard, he kept speeds brisk. Collectively the orchestra sounded happier than the singers, who too often struggled with tuning and articulation, but these sounded like first night problems that should settle. The designs are by Hannah Clark, lighting by Matthew Richardson and video by Ian Galloway. Dressed in secondhand and vintage, hair variously crimped (Bradamante), hippy-long (Ruggiero) or swept up high (Alcina), the cast had a generic retro look. Máire Flavin, in the title role, with the glamour of a film star, handled her fall from regal witchy diva to broken woman affectingly. Fflur Wyn’s Morgana was flighty and charming and, against the odds of the plot, believable. Some of the best singing came from Nick Pritchard, in the smaller role of Morgana’s lover, Oronte. The American countertenor Patrick Terry, in his Opera North debut as the errant knight Ruggiero, not an easy role to flesh out dramatically, found his form in the poignant aria Verdi prati. The Norwegian mezzo-soprano Mari Askvik, also making her house debut as Bradamante, was outstanding vocally but could have been allowed greater girl-power independence. Why not remind us of this knight heroine’s cultural identity as expert in combat, intolerant of weaklings, with a magic lance and, you bet, a flying horse? The softened ending robs the piece of one of its most charged dramatic moments. Instead, in a reference to the cult writer Bruno Schulz’s short story Undula, Alcina crawls and thrashes under a bearskin, a Venus in furs to the last. (Streamed live on 17 February; available until 17 August 2022.) In this early spring feast of baroque opera, Vivaldi’s Bajazet – from 1735, the same year as Alcina – made a triumphant appearance at the Royal Opera House’s Linbury theatre in a compact staging by Adele Thomas, designed by Molly O’Cathain, for Irish National Opera. Blood and gore mixed, excitingly, with flair and effervescence. Vivaldi’s operas, here with borrowings from other composers of the era, are only now becoming available in modern editions and recordings. This is the well-plotted, racy story of the Ottoman emperor Bajazet and his fate at the hands of his Uzbek opponent Tamerlano. Peter Whelan, every inch of his body responding expressively to Vivaldi’s restless, vigorous score, directed from the harpsichord. The 10-strong Irish Baroque Orchestra matched his zest and variety. A brilliant cast led by Claire Booth, Niamh O’Sullivan and James Laing poured physical and vocal energy into each move, each note. It was simply done, stunningly achieved. Brief but spirited applause for a recital livestreamed from Wigmore Hall. The Russian pianist Pavel Kolesnikov, ever a poetic and daring player, constructed a tantalising homage to Proust with music by Schubert, Franck, Hahn and Fauré. It obeyed none of the conventions of an “ordinary recital” and was all the better for it. Still free to watch. Searching for Proust’s lost time instead of our own is a perfect distraction.

2/12/2022,"Mark Berry, better known as Bez, rose to fame as the dancer-slash-percussionist for indie dance group the Happy Mondays. He was born in 1964 in Bolton, and his mother was an auxiliary nurse and his father a chief inspector in the anti-terrorist squad. Bez served three years in a detention centre for a robbery he committed at the age of 17. With Happy Mondays and later Black Grape, he toured the world as a pioneer of the Madchester scene. Today, Bez is known for his political endeavours – in 2015 he set up the We Are the Reality party and stood as MP of Salford – as well as his work as an environmentalist and campaigner. A reality TV favourite, Bez has three sons from previous relationships, and lives in Hereford with his fiance. He is competing in Dancing on Ice on ITV, and is an ambassador for homeless charity Coffee4Craig.  This was taken in Cuba. The US immigration authorities had kicked Black Grape out for smoking weed before a gig. One minute we were sitting in Central Park taking in the smoke with a beautiful view of the twin towers – the next we were surrounded by police. I found the whole thing quite funny. Cuba had just opened up to the west again – we were one of the first planes landing in the country – and it was like walking through a war zone. Everything was crumbling; it was a right old state. But families would cook you a meal in return for a bit of money. In the end we were banned from America, so the press had to come to Cuba to interview us. The journalists were all shitting themselves in fear of what might happen to them, but everyone in Cuba was so lovely to us. One of my favourite memories is sitting at the back of one of Hemingway’s favourite bars with mojitos and big fat cigars. It was unbelievable. I was always drawn to rebellion. Apparently I was a nightmare, even as a baby. I was an attention-seeker, but well liked at school. The first time I got in proper trouble was when I was five. One morning my mum gave me some money and said, “On your break at school you’ve got to buy a packet of crisps – and nothing else.” I got to the front of the queue at the tuck shop and said to the teacher, “Give us a packet of crisps,” and gave her the money. She said I didn’t have enough for the crisps and tried to give me something else. I said, “No, I’ve got to buy crisps with this money – and nothing else.” She tried taking them off me, so I bit her hand. In my defence, it was a genuine mistake. Mum told me to buy the crisps. Dad was a chief inspector when I was a kid. Because of that I was constantly rebelling against authority – which is no bad thing, really. It was a huge part of my psyche growing up; my dad’s since apologised for not understanding my character. At the peak of my rebellion, I did time in detention centres and borstals; my parents kicked me out, so I was living on the street and getting into all sorts of trouble. I lost my teeth at 16 in a motorbike crash. I wasn’t wearing a helmet and was spitting out crumbling bits of tooth for months afterwards. There was no damage to my brain, thankfully, but I still pretended I’d lost my memory when the police came, so I didn’t have to tell them where I was staying. Decades later, I lost my false teeth at Glastonbury. After not sleeping for days, I woke up in the tent, starving, saw a doughnut and took a huge bite. It had been there for ages and was hard as a brick. By the time I was about 19, I decided I didn’t want to get caught up in the sort of shit I was doing again, so thought the best thing I could do was to have a huge adventure and go travelling. I lived in Morocco for a bit and was shoplifting just to survive; pinching bars of chocolate. I got chased out of town and had to hide in a cave for three weeks until the money I’d been waiting for arrived. You create your own reality, and travelling created one that completely changed my whole outlook on life. I was mostly homeless and sofa-surfing when I joined Happy Mondays. It was the right place at the right time, and I’ll never forget going on stage with them for the first time. It was at the Haçienda in December 1985, and I had no time to prepare. Shaun Ryder wanted me up there – I said no at first, but there was a bit of banter between us and I ended up jumping on stage with him. I picked up a pair of maracas and shook them so hard I ended up with a blister the size of a 50p in the middle of my hand. Growing up, dancing was a massive part of our culture: you’d go out to these venues and see different types of dancing in every room – the northern soulers, the metal headbangers, the ska rudeboys, the punks and people who loved disco. I loved it. Even though I get up on stage and dance in front of loads of people, I wouldn’t say I’m a confident person. It’s probably hiding a multitude of insecurities. I’m more curious about the world than confident in it. I met my fiance, Firouzeh Razavi, nearly nine years ago. It was her 30th birthday and she was having a drink with her friends, while I was out with my mate. We walked into this bar, our eyes met across the table, and that was it. I’m not normally romantic, but I tried to make it special when I proposed to her. I set up a posh picnic basket and got her family and my family to wait on the top of this mountain near where we live. Me and Firouzeh walked up the mountain and she noticed a big letter D that I’d put out in tribute to her younger brother who’d died. Then she saw her dad. And her sisters and everyone else, and I proposed. It was great. And it’s easier if everyone is there so you don’t have to tell them all separately afterwards. Firouzeh got me at my best, because I’m 58 in April. I’m a grandad and my wild days are out of my system. I live a really good life. I open the curtains in the morning and say, “How fucking lucky are we?” It’s all for being in Happy Mondays. My favourite nights these days are in my own garden. I have a campfire and a bar that I’ve built, and get all my friends round. I started looking after myself about eight years ago when I thought I was going to start a revolution and set up a political party. I decided that the fight was everywhere in society, and one was with the food industry. Through diet, I realised you can change everything; that’s when I started looking at what I ate. Now I use ginger and turmeric instead of painkillers. I juice every day, using fruit and veg straight out of the garden. If I go for two days without having juice, I start panicking. I’m sure if the version of me pictured in 1996 could hear me say that, he’d tell me to shut up and rack up!",Arts/Music,Bez looks back: ‘I was always drawn to rebellion’ | Flashback,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/12/bez-happy-mondays-i-was-a-nightmare-even-as-a-baby
2/12/2022,"Each year, British punters lose more than £11bn to the gambling industry, equivalent to nearly £164 for every man, woman and child in the UK. This money-spinning national love affair with betting owes much to the liberalisation of gambling laws under Tony Blair’s Labour government in 2005. The growth of the UK betting sector since then has created billionaires, such as Bet365’s Denise Coates and Betfred’s Done brothers. At the other end of the scale, what starts out as a harmless flutter has driven countless customers into financial ruin, family breakups, and worse. The betting industry promotes its wares predominantly through advertising on TV, social media or via wall-to-wall sponsorship of football clubs. But gambling has always been different from other consumer products. Coca-Cola advertises in the knowledge that you probably already know how it tastes. The occasional memory jog will remind you why you like it, and might lead you to buy more and to choose Coke over Pepsi when you do. Convincing a customer to choose your brand – and remain loyal – is only half the battle with gambling. Betting firms also need to persuade punters that they have a decent shot at winning some money, even though – in the long term at least – they don’t.  The gambling industry could not exist unless the bookmaker or casino had a better grasp of the odds than the punter. That’s the foundation upon which the industry is built, and it’s a bargain that – unless they are completely delusional – the gambler enters into knowingly. They bet believing they might just be the one who can beat the bookie, if not by judgment then by luck. For six years, I’ve been reporting on the human damage caused by the gambling industry. I’ve heard the desperation in the voice of someone who has lost hundreds of thousands of pounds in a matter of weeks, and I’ve sat with the parents of young people who had their whole lives ahead of them, until a gambling addiction drove them to suicide. Those affected know the trauma all too well. What is less well widely understood is how gambling companies are able to influence otherwise happy, intelligent and sociable people, causing them to act irrationally, against their own interests. The techniques gambling products use to tap into our psyches are both artful and terrible, marrying simplicity of concept with ingenuity of execution to nudge us towards dark choices. The starting point is understanding cognitive bias. Humans are irrational – we misjudge reality based on our flawed perception of it. Our love of football or support of a team convinces us that our gut feeling about a game is more reliable than it is, while our optimism tells us that, even thought the chances of winning a slot machine jackpot are stacked against us, fate may have chosen to upset the odds this time. Kim Lund, founder of poker game firm Aftermath Interactive, has made a career out of game design and has seen at first-hand how cold, hard probability defeats the illogical human mind every time – and allows the gambling companies to cash in. “All gambling games are based on psychological triggers that mean they work,” he tells me. “The human brain is incapable of dealing with randomness. We’re obsessed with finding patterns in things because that prevents us from going insane. We want to make sense of things.” Unlike many forms of gambling, poker requires a high degree of skill; if your opponent is a bad player, they are unlikely to get the better of you with luck, at least not over time. Dr Philip Newall, a former poker player turned academic psychologist, has been studying dynamics like these for much of his professional life. At the poker table, he enjoyed a degree of success because he played just one type of game – fixed-limit hold ’em – where all bets and raises are fixed at a certain amount. Newall stuck to what he knew and, for the most part, only played against people he could be fairly sure, from telltale signs such as their patterns of play, weren’t professionals. That background, coupled with his in-depth study of psychology, makes him well placed to explain what the industry knows – and exploits – about how our minds work. Newall used to walk down Walworth Road in London, a high street replete with bookmakers’ shops. He would pass William Hill, Betfred and Ladbrokes, and notice they were all offering similar types of bet that went something like this: “Manchester United to win 3–1 v Burnley and Marcus Rashford to score first.” This very common type of bet is known in the trade as a scorecast. It requires a combination of events to occur at once, in this case the exact score, the winning team and the first goal scorer. As soon as you start combining probabilities of multiple events, the odds lengthen very quickly. This means that a scorecast outcome is pretty unlikely, so the bookmaker can offer what looks like a bargain 15–1, knowing the chances of it happening may be more like 50–1. To the average person in the street, the idea of Marcus Rashford scoring the first goal to help Manchester United to a 3–1 win over Burnley sounds like a pretty plausible scenario. When a gambler thinks about that scorecast bet, they are picturing in their mind’s eye an in-form striker opening the scoring in a routine victory over an inferior team. A standard Saturday afternoon. But bookmakers are sitting on a mine of information on their historical return from scorecasts, and will have a good idea of the difference between the odds they’re offering and the real odds. They don’t publicise this for obvious reasons. That, in Newall’s words, would be “killing their own action”, giving a disproportionate amount of information to the person on the other side of the bet. In poker, the saying is: “Don’t teach the fish” – fish being bad players you can easily take money from. Instead of teaching the fish, gambling companies try to ensure, through the types of bet they promote most heavily, that as many people opt to gamble their money on more complex probability scenarios, rather than sticking to simpler outcomes. José Perales is an associate professor in the Mind, Brain and Behaviour Research Centre at the University of Granada in Spain. He has studied the same phenomena as Newall and explains that this is the result of something called the “representativeness heuristic”. He said: “A heuristic is a rule of thumb, something you can use that works pretty well in your daily life, but can convince you to make quite serious mistakes, especially when they’re deliberately exploited, which is the case here.” The football match scenario in question is something gamblers can easily envisage happening and that they may even have seen before. It could happen. But the necessary confluence of multiple events means it is actually far less likely than it instinctively feels. There are many other possible outcomes that are just as likely. Gambling companies are getting better and better at targeting this sort of weakness in our mental defences. Newall tracked TV adverts over two World Cups in 2014 and 2018, drawing on data collected by the Guardian data journalist Pamela Duncan. He found that standard home win, draw, away win bets (on the winner of the match) simply disappeared from one tournament to the next. These straightforward, easier-to-understand wagers featured in nearly 8% of adverts at the 2014 tournament, but had dwindled to nothing at the next. By contrast, high odds, complex bets shot up from 4% to nearly 35%. The result? A very lucrative World Cup for the gambling companies. As the odds lengthen, the gambler’s ability to calculate them weakens. This is an example of how the betting industry benefits from “informational asymmetry”. Online casino operators know everything about you – particularly when they can track your online patterns of play and analyse the data in minute detail. The majority of punters, by contrast, know very little about the company on the other end of the bet. Philip Newall coined the phrase “dark nudges” to describe techniques used by the betting firms. The phrase is a nod to the 2008 book Nudge, by economists Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein. A favourite of former UK prime minister David Cameron, the book draws on psychology and behavioural economics to examine how people in positions of authority can “nudge” others into making decisions that benefit them and society. The idea is that you can drive positive changes without needing to be openly coercive, which might make people resistant. Of course, you can nudge people towards poor choices, too. Nobody will stake money on Liverpool losing 15–0 to Port Vale, because they know this is close to impossible. But in games that are entirely random, players exert no control at all over the success of their bet. Indeed, assuming that the game isn’t rigged, nobody has total authority over the outcome. Gamblers often behave as if they do not understand this. Sociologists have observed dice players throwing softly when they want a low number and hard when they want a high one, for instance. In her 1975 paper The Illusion of Control, Ellen J Langer conducted a series of experiments that showed that our expectations of success in a game of chance vary, depending on factors that do not actually affect the outcome. One of the variables that makes a big difference to how gamblers behave is the introduction of an element of choice. In one of Langer’s experiments, subjects were given lottery tickets with an American football player on them. Some subjects got to choose which player they wanted, others were allocated a ticket at random. On the morning of the draw, everyone was asked how much they would be prepared to sell their ticket for. Those who had chosen their ticket demanded an average of $8.67, while those who had been allocated one at random were prepared to give it up for $1.96. Even though the choice of a ticket had no influence on which one would be the winner, those who had made a conscious decision were significantly less willing to abandon it. Dr Steve Sharman, research fellow in the School of Psychology at the University of East London, is a specialist in gambling psychology. He explains what’s going on: “If you go into a casino and you’re playing roulette, they show the previous outcomes. They might show so-called ‘hot numbers’ or ‘cold numbers’. A hot number is one that has come up a lot recently, while a cold one hasn’t been seen for a while. By displaying them, the casino is inviting you to entertain the idea that previous spins of the roulette wheel have an effect on future spins.” This, explains Sharman, reinforces something called the gambler’s fallacy, or the failure to appreciate the “statistical independence of turns”. “If I’ve had 10 heads in a row, it doesn’t make it more likely that tails will come up next,” he says. “But gamblers don’t think like that.” Indeed, people in general don’t tend to think like that. I came across hot numbers while reporting on fixed-odds betting terminals too. Above the machines, staff would plaster a notice advertising which numbers had been coming up a lot lately on the machines’ digital roulette games. This, says Sharman, “reinforces the sense that you are basing your decision on something other than complete chance”. At that point, you’re labouring under an illusion that you have some kind of agency. José Perales points out that there are different kinds of illusion of control. One type is related to the notion that some person or force other than ourselves is pulling the strings, and that our behaviour might be able to affect that force. That’s something we can recognise in those who believe in the power of prayer, or simple superstition – don’t walk under that ladder or you’ll have bad luck. The other kind is a belief in our own abilities. That’s something at play in those complex football bets – the feeling that you know quite a lot about football so your instinct that Rashford will nab the first goal in a 3–1 win is a decent shout. The illusion of control is a psychological phenomenon that can be particularly effective among the cohort of people most likely to be problem gamblers: young men. Perales contends that young, educated men are particularly susceptible to the mostly illusory notion that they are using their intelligence to get ahead. “Their general reasoning abilities are pretty good. But that doesn’t protect them from developing cognitive biases related to how gambling works. You can feed their sense of confidence and self-worth by designing the product in such a way that you increase the sense of control or the sense that you are learning something.” This could work by displaying hot numbers or nudging betters towards complex markets where they believe they are well informed. It also works with something incredibly simple, like the mechanism of an online slots game. In some games you click on “spin” and the reels whiz round and stop of their own accord. In others, you can stop them at a moment of your choosing. “It’s very difficult to avoid the feeling that the physical process determines the outcome. But it’s just a random-number generator,” says Perales. In other words, whether you stop the spin or you let the computer do it, it doesn’t make a difference. But it somehow feels as if it does. Make a simple bet on Tiger Roll to win the Grand National and you lose your stake if the thoroughbred throws his rider at the first fence. There’s no hiding the fact that you’ve lost. That isn’t always the case, though. One of the most common devices that gambling firms use to placate punters and keep them coming back for more are losses disguised as wins. On a slot machine, you might deposit some money on Egyptology-themed game Eye of Horus, set your bet to £1 and spin. Most of the time you lose the stake. A small percentage of the time you spin and get more than £1 back. But one of the other outcomes is that you lose a portion of your stake, say 50p. At that point, an animated box flashes up saying: “Winner paid 50p.” “Objectively, you’ve still lost,” says Sharman. But the slot machine frames it as a win. Gambling companies have an incentive to ensure you don’t twig that you’re steadily haemorrhaging cash, and that informs the way games are designed. Typically, a machine might flash up with the same music and lights for a win as it does for a loss disguised as a win. “The only feedback you might get is the lights and sounds,” says Sharman. “So, if there’s no difference between the feedback from a win and a disguised loss, that’s a clever way of tricking the neurological circuitry.” In 2020, the Gambling Commission set up a working group to look into ways of making slots and other products safer. One of the results of the process was that the misleading happy music, as well as visual effects that may disguise a loss as a win, were abolished. The reels on the slot machine spin. The first strip lands on cherries, and the second lands on cherries too. The third briefly touches on cherries … and then slides on – perhaps in slow motion – to the lemon, or the gold bars. Behind this common image lies a strange phenomenon. “Near misses are very interesting,” Steve Sharman says. “They’re consistently rated as being more unpleasant. People feel worse when they have a near miss than when there’s a massive miss. At the same time, they make people want to continue gambling more.” Sharman and his fellow researchers decided to test how gamblers react to two different types of slot machine near miss: the ones where the reel spins one place too far, beyond the “payline” (the horizontal axis along which the crucial symbols appear); and the one where it doesn’t spin far enough. Interestingly, they found that when the reel doesn’t reach the payline, the gambler is more likely to keep playing, having apparently been on the brink of the jackpot. But if the reel moves one place too far, it seems to dissuade people from continuing, almost as if the chance of a win briefly materialised and must now have gone for good. Yet neither outcome actually has any bearing on the result of the next spin. Modern online slot machine games, with multiple lines of play, are more complex than the old-school one-armed bandits. They move much faster too, in order to increase the rate at which they take your money. This makes it harder to spot near misses during regular play. But most slots have bonus features, an occasional moment where the opportunity to win a bigger prize comes up and the gambler pays closer attention, including to near misses. This is when today’s slot machine gambler might be more likely to experience the emotional reaction to the perception that they almost won big. The feeling that you’re getting a good deal is another motivating factor that makes you more likely to bet. But it’s worth it for the house if it brings you back for a second bet at riskier odds. One of the products that has emerged in recent years is “boosted odds”, where the bookmaker gives you much longer odds than you would usually get, say 15–1 that a good team such as Chelsea will beat a weaker side like Fulham. Sometimes this will be on offer to new customers only, as a means of driving new account sign-ups. The same phenomenon is at play with the “free” bets and bonus spins that companies hand out. “It’s called the house money effect,” explains Philip Newall. “People are much more risk-seeking with money they’ve won than with money they’ve paid in.” If the house gives you a free spin, you’ve got nothing to lose. Except that such free bets and bonuses usually come with strings attached. You get them, for the most part, only on the condition that you’ll “roll over” the bet into a second or third one. Sometimes the bet has to be rolled over many more times before it can be withdrawn. The house money effect makes that whole process feel like a free ride. Of course, all the while you are becoming habituated to gambling, and you’re more likely to return with your own money and to go on longer rides, this time at your own expense. “The more you bet, the more you’ll get free bets, and the more likely that you give it straight back,” says recovering addict Phil Worrall, from Nottingham. “You might think you’ve got no money left, but if you get an email saying you’ll get a £50 free bet if you bet £50 of your own money, you find a way to scrape it together. It’s a little hook back in.” There is a question mark over the extent to which gambling firms are deploying these techniques with precision. Some of these phenomena are so woven into the fabric of certain products that they aren’t so much being weaponised as a fundamental feature of gambling. If you’re at a casino and you put all your chips on 25, spin the roulette wheel and it lands on 26, the only person you can blame for that near miss is Lady Luck, whatever the detrimental effects on you may be. It’s a near miss, but not a manufactured one. It is self-evidently an intrinsic part of the game you’ve chosen. It would, of course, be different if a digital game were designed in such a way as to make this happen more than is statistically likely. I have spoken to many problem gamblers who are convinced this is the case – that the machines are rigged to push your buttons as much as you push theirs, to maximise near misses and capitalise on psychological weaknesses. I have never seen any evidence for this and such information would surely be closely guarded by any company unscrupulous enough to deploy it. The same goes for the “early win”. This is something that crops up again and again in my conversations with gambling addicts, and it is backed up by statistics. A 2019 report from the National Gambling Treatment Service, an umbrella term for several organisations offering help to addicts, found that 62% of those receiving treatment had experienced a big win at the start of their gambling career. It makes sense that hitting the jackpot soon after you start gambling – or even early within a session – creates a memory of that sweet feeling that might drive you to gamble more and more, hoping to recapture the same taste. It’s reminiscent of the horror stories parents tell their kids about drug dealers giving out free samples to get people hooked. In the course of my journalism, I occasionally experiment with various gambling products so that I can get a better idea of what I’m talking about. On my very first go with online slots, I had a couple of big wins. (Steady on, we’re only talking a tenner here.) I don’t know what would have happened if I’d carried on gambling, but the return to player on that game was 96.09% – spend £100, on average you get £96.09 back – so it’s a certainty that I’d have lost my winnings eventually. When it comes to online casino games and slots, Kim Lund feels that something less cunning is going on: that firms are simply watching what makes money and repeating it in a robotic process of trial and error. “My main gripe with the industry is that it has, to a large degree, been run by people who don’t love it, who treat gamblers as dumb sheep. They see gambling like petrol: ‘We have a commodity – how do we sell it? What else can we sell them while they’re at the gas station?’” The result is an evolutionary mechanism that rewards the development of addictive content while absolving anyone from the responsibility for its impact. Breaking this cycle can be done. In the course of writing about the gambling industry, I hear inspiring stories of people like Chris Murphy, who used to gamble online secretly at night as his girlfriend slept beside him, but now works for the Sporting Chance clinic, run by former England footballer Tony Adams, helping athletes with addiction issues. Or James Grimes, who lost everything betting on football and now works via his group The Big Step to disentangle gambling from the game he loves. But tales of recovery like these require superhuman effort – and a good deal of support from friends, family and treatment services. All too often these safety nets are lacking and there is nothing to fall back on; no recourse but another spin of the wheel.

2/12/2022,"Boris Johnson should not be involved in selecting the new head of the Metropolitan police while he remains under investigation for alleged lockdown breaches, a former force commissioner has said. Ian Blair, a former Met commissioner, called on the prime minister to recuse himself from involvement in the process, describing the decision about Cressida Dick’s replacement as “an enormously important choice”.  Lord Blair’s remarks echo a number of calls for Johnson to stay out of the process, with the opposition warning it would entail a serious breach of ethical standards if he is involved while being investigated by the force. The prime minister was sent a legal questionnaire by Scotland Yard on Friday over the alleged parties in Downing Street, No 10 confirmed, signalling that police are investigating whether Johnson personally broke the law. He has seven days to adequately explain his attendance or be fined for breaking the rules he himself set. Discussing the process of replacing Dick after the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, made clear she had lost his confidence, Blair told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “That’s a very difficult issue and I do accept that. I think Boris Johnson should recuse himself from being involved. “But it’s an enormously important choice and presumably it will take some time to get to being to who the commissioner is, and by that stage presumably he will have filled in his questionnaire and the matter will be over.” Dick’s dramatic resignation on Thursday evening came hours after she told a radio phone that she had “absolutely no intention” of standing down and had a plan to rid the Met of its toxic culture. She was forced out after Khan made it clear he had no confidence in her plan to reform the force after a series of scandals revealing racism, misogyny and homophobia within elements of the force. No 10 said the prime minister had no official role in choosing the Met commissioner and the final decision would be made by the home secretary, Priti Patel, who is a close ally of Johnson. However, Brian Paddick, a former senior Met officer who is now a Liberal Democrat peer, said fairness in the appointment process could only be guaranteed by Johnson stepping down as prime minister. “It is inconceivable anyone will be appointed as commissioner of the Met without the approval of the PM,” Paddick said. “When you have a PM under criminal investigation, that is very problematic. I’m unconvinced that the PM giving his personal assurance that he will take no part will reassure the public.” The calls for Johnson to distance himself from the process come after Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, expressed alarm at a Times article that quoted an unnamed “senior ally” of the prime minister saying Scotland Yard should exercise caution when making a decision that could see Johnson forced out. “This raises very serious questions about both the rule of law andbasic standards of government,” she said. “If the prime minister and his allies are going to publicly lean on the police to try to get him off the hook for an offence, he cannot then get involved in appointing a commissioner who would decide whether to charge him.” Rayner urged the government to “make clear that no one under investigation will be involved in any way”, pressuring Johnson to “say now if he will recuse himself or explain how public confidence will be maintained in a fair process”.",News/UK news,Boris Johnson ‘should not be involved in picking new Met chief’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/12/boris-johnson-ian-blair-new-met-chief
2/12/2022,"The former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith has warned Boris Johnson it will be hard to cling to power if the Metropolitan police finds he breached Covid rules. The comments from the senior Tory will ratchet up pressure on the prime minister to resign if he broke the law, after Johnson received a questionnaire from the Met on Friday regarding alleged parties in Downing Street.  Johnson has so far remained bullish, insisting he broke no rules and having rejected calls to go. But Duncan Smith’s intervention could guide backbenchers – many of whom are said to be waiting for the Met’s probe to conclude before deciding whether to submit letters of no confidence. If Johnson broke the law, “I think it would be very tough for anyone to remain after that”, Duncan Smith told the i. “If you’ve set the laws, and you break them and the police decide you have broken them. “It will be difficult [if he’s fined], he knows that,” Duncan Smith continued. He added that Johnson should do more to convince MPs he can dig himself out of the hole, and must further reset No 10’s culture through restructuring. Duncan Smith’s words were echoed by Bob Neill, the Conservative chair of the Commons justice committee, who said that Johnson staying on after a potential breach of the law would represent an unacceptable “double standard”. “I think it will be very difficult for anyone to be in the position of the country’s principal lawmaker, and then break a law which they themselves had brought into force, and in particular, very much preached to other people to stick to,” Neill told Times Radio. “You can’t have double standards.” But Johnson’s allies have said he will refuse to stand down if the policy investigation finds he broke the law. “I will survive,” Johnson sang to Guto Harri, his new communications director, Harri told the Welsh-language news website Golwg.360. The former Conservative prime ministers Theresa May and, this week, John Major have publicly raised questions about Johnson’s leadership. May told Johnson in the Commons last month: “What the Gray report does show is that No 10 Downing Street was not observing the regulations they had imposed on members of the public. “So either my right honourable friend had not read the rules or didn’t understand what they meant and others around him, or they didn’t think the rules applied to No 10. Which was it?” The idea that No 10 indulged in boozy parties while the nation refrained from seeing loved ones to stop the spread of the deadly virus has left Johnson on the ropes. A 25 January YouGov poll of 3,550 adults found that 62% said Johnson should resign – including 38% of Conservative voters – up from 56% on 11 January. On Thursday, Major took aim at Johnson’s leadership for eroding public trust in politics. “The charge that there is one law for the government and one for everyone else is politically deadly – and it has struck home,” Major said. Major criticised the handling of the Partygate row, saying that “brazen excuses were dreamed up” for ministers to “defend the indefensible”, with the upshot of making “the government look distinctly shifty”. The most direct assault on Johnson’s premiership by a senior Tory came from the former Brexit secretary David Davis. Quoting the words of Oliver Cromwell, later said to Neville Chamberlain, Davis told the prime minister: “In the name of God, go.”",News/Politics,"Boris Johnson’s position ‘difficult’ if Met fines him, warns Iain Duncan Smith",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/12/boris-johnson-partygate-met-fines-iain-duncan-smith-warns
2/12/2022,"Asummer spent in Iceland convinced me that Ireland has much to learn from our Nordic neighbours. The mercury rarely rises above 15C in Iceland in July, but the locals compensate with frequent visits to outdoor geothermal pools that seem to feature in every town, village and crossroads. I spent many happy hours in poolside hot tubs and saunas, seeing how the locals have learned to embrace the outdoors and make the most of their subarctic climate.  Then, several years ago, my wife booked us a trip around Finland in late November. Darkness fell at about 3pm and multiple coats and hats just about kept the cold at bay. But things began to look up when we discovered that most towns and villages feature steaming, outdoor saunas. We were soon thawing with the locals in a different sauna every night. Conversation flowed and I learned how the Finns have also come to embrace their cold climate with frequent visits to outdoor saunas, followed by a brief dip in one of their 188,000 lakes. Being tightly packed into a small, hot room forges a bond, which might help explain why Finland has been voted the happiest country in the world for the past four years running. Despite initial reservations about the cold and the dark, this holiday was a lesson in how the Finns’ reverence for spending time in nature could be adapted to our own shores. Those of us who live in countries where winter is often a three-season event need all the heat we can get to keep our spirits buoyant. So my antennae began to twitch when I came across a new log cabin hideaway on the shores of Lough Oughter, in Killykeen Forest Park in County Cavan. Cavan boasts 365 lakes. A local photographer spent lockdown cataloguing them to prove they all exist. Intrigued, I took a boat a few weeks ago from the Cavan Adventure Centre to explore some of them. When several architectural cabins on stilts appeared behind the tree-lined shore, I tied up at a smart, red-tin boathouse where a bearded, flannel-shirt-wearing South African welcomed me to Cabü by the Lakes. Bernard gave me a quick tour of the 100-acre grounds, featuring 28 cabins, several outdoor hot tubs and saunas, and a giant open-air bar and games room, where we nursed hot chocolates in front of a super-sized stove. The owners of Cowley Timbers, a construction firm in Nottinghamshire, took over this long-established resort from the Irish Forestry Board in 2017 and have brought all their expertise in wood construction to update the site. The company has a sister property on the Kent coast and plans to open another in the Cotswolds. I pledged to return for a stay, and within weeks I found myself driving down the dark, twisting roads leading from Cavan town towards Killykeen Forest with my wife, young son and excited dog. Ireland, not unlike Finland, can feel bleak and miserable in winter, but once we pulled into Cabü by the Lakes the strings of festoon lights adorning the wooden buildings soon banished any gloom. The views of darkening skies looked considerably more attractive when seen from the confines of a bubbling hot tub in the woods, with a gin and tonic in our hands. I began to realise how divorced my life has become from the natural world, as I initially felt unsettled by the enormity of the surrounding darkness. As the night wore on this fear was replaced by awe, as I relaxed and reset my city persona. Cavan doesn’t have the snowy charms of Finland, but being in the wild, wherever you are, can restore your connection to something bigger. Later we lit the woodburner in our gorgeously designed cabin and flung open the Crittall doors to reveal the moon lighting up the lake in the distance. My wife happily settled into our cosy, wood-clad bedroom with a small mountain of books and barely budged from there for the rest of the weekend. It was hard to believe we were still in Ireland: we all felt as if we had been transported back to Scandinavia, or to a cutting-edge retreat in upstate New York. The next morning, Bernard kitted out my son and I with lifejackets and sent us off with a map and a boat with an outboard engine, to putter for miles through flooded rivers overhung with tunnels of tangled trees, leading to countless quiet lakes. The noise of our approaching engine prompted huddles of swans to take flight. Whooper swans with yellow beaks fly here from Iceland every year, their arrival heralding the start of winter. There’s not a lot of colour in the landscape at this time of year: the lakes, trees and clouds all shimmer in multiple shades of grey, giving the impression of travelling through a 19th-century German romantic painting by Caspar David Friedrich. We turned for home when the towering skyline of Killeshandra and its milk factory come into view. On our return trip we hung a left at Lady Farnham’s cottage and steered the tiller for 13th-century Cloughoughter castle, located on a tiny island on Lough Oughter. Back at Cabü a well-earned Guinness awaited us in the newly opened bar, which we followed with a wedge of the brilliantly named Cavanbert (from nearby Corleggy Cheeses) that we picked up at the Cabü shop. An ensuing hour in an outdoor wooden bath, watching the trees sway slowly in a soft breeze, was perhaps the highlight of our trip. It rained lightly the next morning. At dawn I walked along the lake shore, marvelling at the sound of the drops falling off the leaves. The rain lifted as Bernard set off from the jetty to take us on a morning of fishing and more lake-hopping. He told us how Cavan’s hilly, drumlin landscape was formed by the retreating glaciers. Later, we rented bikes and followed the lake paths around Killykeen Forest , through acres of dense spruce and silver birch. Before we left for home that night I heard a cuckoo sing in the woods for the first time in many years. I’m so often aware of the Faustian bargain that city living entails: for all the joys of the bright lights, there is a trade-off, and we can lose the connection with nature that’s so vital for our souls. Ireland’s damp weather has its own beauty, and Cabü by the Lakes has created a Scandi-inspired retreat to access the healing power of the outdoors. My trip to Finland taught me that there’s much to love about cold climates, and I’m glad I don’t have to jump on a plane any more to experience this type of holiday. More cabin retreats and saunas are popping up beside lakes, rivers and beaches all over Ireland and the UK, and it’s a joy to be able to awaken the senses in locations that make the most of the great outdoors.The trip was provided by Cabü by the Lakes; one-bedroom cabins from €175 a night (two-night minimum, three at weekends) The Saltwater Sauna, PooleCreated by a Nordic sauna enthusiast this wood-fired Finnish sauna on Sandbanks beach seats eight and has views of the sea from its picture window.

2/12/2022,"On 13 November 2015, Islamist gunmen opened fire on concertgoers at the Bataclan theatre in Paris, killing 90 people. Among the victims was Hélène Muyal-Leiris, who was survived by her husband Antoine Leiris and their 19-month-old son Melvil. Three days later Leiris, a journalist, addressed his wife’s killers in a Facebook post, declaring: “I don’t know who you are and I don’t want to know … I will not give you the satisfaction of hating you”. This wasn’t just a bereaved man’s cri de coeur, it was a pre-emptive protest against a far right that would try to leverage France’s grief for its nationalist agenda. Leiris’s post went viral, was adopted as a liberal rallying cry, and was followed in 2016 by You Will Not Have My Hate, a slim memoir which quickly became an international bestseller.  Now, six years later, comes a kind of sequel. Whereas the first book zoomed in, recounting how Leiris and Melvil survived the 12 days after the attack, the second pans back. Life, After covers four years, describing how they build a life together “like two escapees from the ordinary world”. Seeking a fresh start, Leiris moves them from a historic street in Montmartre to a sixth-floor new-build apartment in the 16th arrondissement. “I am embracing the now,” he tells us in his brisk present tense, lucidly translated by Sam Taylor: “the immediate, the convenient, the practical, the ephemeral, the washable, the soundproofed”. Both father and son must deal, in their different ways, with the problem of memory. As Melvil turns four and five, Leiris wrestles with what to tell him about the mother he’ll never remember but whose absence will shape his whole life. For Leiris himself, memory is a ghost to be exorcised. At first he stores Hélène’s possessions in a basement eight flights beneath his apartment. Then, one day, he impulsively throws everything – bar two dresses and the jacket his wife was wearing the night she died – in black bin liners: “The letters, the photographs, the clothes … they were the new body that death gave Hélène. A scattered body that I am now tearing to pieces so I can rid myself of it.” Violent, troubling moments like this are what make Life, After a more interesting book than its determinedly dignified predecessor. It’s impossible to ignore the fact that this man, who became famous for disavowing hate, is in fact brimming with fury. When he’s ready to date again, he’s baffled to find himself taking out his pain on a new partner: “I became cruel. I made her pay for something that I hadn’t yet identified by showing her that I could be cowardly, vile, insecure”. The book’s most powerful and revealing passages hint that Leiris’s hate, and his need to repudiate it, go much further back. His unhappy parents quarrelled bitterly and then divorced. His mother went on to numb her pain with pills and alcohol before one day falling asleep while smoking a cigarette, sustaining burns that would go on to kill her. “From above, I watched myself acting as if nothing was wrong,” writes Leiris; “I was split in two.” When, after Hélène’s death, he occasionally finds himself angry with his son, he has “the impression that that rage doesn’t belong to me. I try to get rid of it. I wonder where it comes from.” In History of Violence, published in France in the same year as Leiris’s first book, the author Édouard Louis recounted a brutal sexual assault he suffered at the hands of a man whose father was a migrant from Algeria. For Louis, memory is a psychic and political tool, a sharp shovel blade to excavate not only his own pain but that of his attacker and the colonial racism that produced it. By looking his enemy in the eye, he attempts to see himself and his country more clearly. By contrast, Leiris’s writing can be read as a heartbreaking study in the unconscious denial that so often attends traumatic loss, as eloquent in what it doesn’t (or can’t) say as in what it does. You think back to the words Leiris addressed to Hélène’s murderers – I don’t know who you are and I don’t want to know – and wonder who else in his history of violence he might be addressing.
