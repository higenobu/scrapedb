5/15/2022,"Once upon a time, many years ago, there were two warriors named Alf and Roy who fought for rival clans. Alf accused Roy of feigning injury after he had collapsed with ruptured knee ligaments and for the next four years, whenever they met on the battlefield, their fighting was fierce. But then Alf joined the local rivals of Roy’s team. In the derby, Roy hit Alf on the knee, hard, and Alf conceived a terrible revenge. Alf had a young son, less than a year old, and he raised him to be a great warrior. His son had extraordinary physical gifts. He was tall and powerful and fast. He was highly skilled. Kings and queens from all around the world wanted Alf’s son to join their army. But Alf’s son was only going to end up at one place: at the rivals to Roy’s team. Roy’s team were already struggling after their great commander had retired. Alf’s old team, aided by the wealth of a great family from abroad, were already dominant. And now they had the mighty young warrior many believed might become the greatest in the world. It had taken 21 years, but Alf was ready for his victory. If football these days is largely about content production, this is a great narrative strand in the Uefa Football Universe. Here is Erling Haaland, who looks like he was brought to life in a tower at midnight during a storm: could this be the dark magic that will, at last, bring Manchester City the Champions League? Haaland is remarkable in every respect. His numbers are absurd: 78 goals in 70 league starts over the past four seasons; 23 goals in 19 appearances in the Champions League. There are times when he makes the game look stupidly easy: get ball, run with ball, kick ball, goal. He is huge, capable of battering opponents out of the way, but his game is about far more than that. His youth coaches point out that his growth came relatively late and so, before he could use his power, he first learned to use his intelligence and movement; the players he seems most to have admired growing up were not bustling target men but Robin van Persie, Jamie Vardy and Michu. He is in the top 3% of players in Europe’s top five leagues for goals and assists – and also for clearances. He scores relatively few headed goals for a player of his size: seven of his 86 for Dortmund in all competitions. This season, he has won 57.6% of aerial duels, a marked increase on the previous two seasons. That may not sound great but is high for a forward (most aerial duels are won by the defender). If nothing else, he will draw away a tall marker, creating space for others – and City already have a +17 goal difference from set plays this season which, if sustained until the end of the season, would be a Premier League record. On the face of it, Haaland is just what City need to be even more devastating than they already are – even if his uncomplicated physicality seems antithetical to the precise patterns and sophisticated mechanisms of a Pep Guardiola side. But that may be his strength, that he offers the sort of unpredictability, the sort of capacity to break a game that, in a very different way, Lionel Messi did for Barcelona. City, weird as it may sound for a club who have scored more goals than anybody else in the Premier League this season, are not particularly efficient in front of goal. They have had the better xG in every league game this season but have lost three times and dropped 19 points. More significantly, having hammered Real Madrid in the first leg of their Champions League but won only 4-3, they converted one of the nine shots they had on target before Real scored with their first two at the Bernabéu. This is where we run into the real intrigue of the Haaland signing. He is a disruptor. He is not one of the “obedient little schoolboys” Zlatan Ibrahimovic mocked Guardiola’s Barcelona squad for being; indeed, he has cited Ibrahimovic as an inspiration and signed to the same agent. Barcelona bought Ibrahimovic in 2009 to offer a more physical attacking option, to ensure they were not reliant on the rhythms of La Masia. As it turned out, he was too different, refused to sacrifice himself sufficiently to the system and fell out with everybody. Haaland, too, is a different option. Guardiola has worked successfully with strikers – David Villa, Robert Lewandowski, Sergio Agüero – but they were comfortable pulling wide and dropping deep. Haaland is different; a more direct, more orthodox striker. Although he does score regularly from low cutbacks, the classic City goal, opportunities for his trademark surge from deep may be scarce given City play habitually so high. But perhaps that doesn’t matter: Haaland will enhance City’s threat on the break in games against better opposition, against teams who do push up against them. But Haaland’s pass completion rate this season is 71.3%; none of City’s present options at centre-forward – Gabriel Jesus, Phil Foden, Raheem Sterling, Jack Grealish or Bernardo Silva – average under 85%. Even if that is largely to do with Borussia Dortmund’s approach, an adjustment will be required. Haaland is six years younger than Ibrahimovic was when he was signed for Barça, less fully formed, less of an outsider. He is also far more reserved and being the rebel is not part of his make-up. The sort of blow-up that happened with Ibrahimovic is unlikely. But that doesn’t mean signing him is not a risk. City need to be more clinical but, by bringing in somebody who can be more ruthless in taking chances, there is a good chance they don’t create so many – but then they may not need to. Striking the right balance is critical, particularly for a team whose method is so rooted in control. Alf’s Revenge adds an extra note of intrigue, but there is far more in the Haaland signing than that.",Sport/Football,Alf’s revenge: disruptor Erling Haaland can be the striker Pep Guardiola craves | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/14/alfs-revenge-disruptor-erling-haaland-can-be-the-striker-pep-guardiola-craves
5/15/2022,"When it rains, the pupils at Wales high school, south Yorkshire, know to look out for numerous obstacles as they move around the building - buckets, lots of buckets. “On a rainy day, it’s commonplace to see a dozen buckets around the school,” said headteacher Pepe Di’Iasio. “You can’t do anything long term. We’re just patching over the roof and doing the various things that we can. We have flat roofs, asbestos throughout the place and an old energy system that uses heavy amounts. We have a building that we heat up every day and the heating goes straight up out of the roof.” Inspectors have told him that his school, in Kiveton Park, near Rotherham, is among the bottom 200 in terms of its condition. Yet with only 50 schools accepted for the government’s school rebuilding plan each year, most of those will have to wait. “When you consider the increased energy costs at the moment, that’s waiting another year when energy costs have increased by over 100% and students are in inadequate buildings,” Di’Iasio said. When the Labour MP for York Central, Rachael Maskell, visited a local outstanding school, she was amazed at what she was shown. Education at All Saints Roman Catholic school is highly regarded, but Maskell was left in no doubt that it was no environment for teaching. “Music takes place in an old aircraft hangar, which is freezing cold or boiling hot in the summer,” she said. “You’ve got the gym, where feet are going through the floors. There are issues with water ingress. It’s a place with a fantastic history, but for a modern school today, it doesn’t serve that purpose.” The school is also among those to have made a bid for funding. Yet while a lucky few will be successful, it is now clear that both teachers across the country and figures within Whitehall believe a far bigger pot of money is needed. Education figures track the problems back to big cuts to the budgets for school buildings back in 2010. “When I took over 13 years ago, we had real problems,” said Paul Gosling, headteacher at Exeter Road community primary school in Exmouth, Devon. “We had a pitched roof and water running down three of the classroom walls when it rained. “It was a sorry state, there were bits of asbestos in places, making it difficult to do any remedial work. The whole roof needed a replacement. We were given a quote of £700,000 for it. We used to have about £45,000 capital funding, but in 2010, that was reduced. Our £45,000 went down to £7,000 – I did say to my governors that we’ve got to save up for 100 years, then we can do the roof.” When water started running over electricity boxes and the school sought help from the local MP, it was granted funds for rebuilding work, which was finished last year. But as regional branch secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, he is aware of many other schools that haven’t been so lucky. “One school has three temporary classrooms that are rotting and falling apart, and not fit for 21st century education. Devon has a stock of 300-odd schools. In a two-year period, we were only one of four schools getting that sort of major investment. There’s no way that system of pooling the money is going to address the needs that we’ve got. There are many schools that are falling into some real disrepair.” The bill for school repairs certainly seems to be growing. Last year, an official audit found that schools in England face a repair bill of more than £11bn, almost double some previous estimates. Several teachers also pointed out that the current system for funding repairs was inefficient. Schools often spent money patching up their buildings, shortly before they were finally granted funding for a rebuild. They said schools should be told about funding awards further in advance. Maskell said that she was aware of other schools in her constituency facing similar problems to All Saints. She, too, said that spiking energy costs were making the situation even more urgent. “Many have old heating systems. With the cost of living going up, you’re going to end up heating up York – and you’re going to pay for it. “All Saints is a fantastic school. It does remarkably well and has a reputation for caring and supporting its pupils. You just think, if it had a decent school environment, too, what more could be achieved there,” Maskell said.",News/Education,Headteachers fight for funds to shore up England’s dilapidated classrooms,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/14/headteachers-funds-england-dilapidated-classrooms
5/15/2022,"Many school buildings in England are now in such disrepair they are a “risk to life”, according to internal government documents leaked to the Observer. Emails sent by senior officials working for education secretary Nadhim Zahawi to Downing Street show them raising the alarm on two occasions within the last six weeks. The officials call as a matter of urgency for the Treasury to make extra billions available to increase the number of school rebuilding projects from 50 a year to more than 300. On 30 March, as part of a weekly update to No 10 from the Department for Education (DfE), the senior officials cite the problem of deteriorating school buildings under the heading “upcoming risks and opportunities” . They say: “School buildings: the deteriorating condition of the school estate continues to be a risk, with condition funding flat for FY [financial year] 2022-23, some sites a risk-to-life, too many costly and energy-inefficient repairs rather than rebuilds, and rebuild demand x3 supply.” The same email goes on to make clear how the DfE is battling with the Treasury for £13bn, now available as a result of recent reforms to higher education, to spend on school repairs. “DfE continues to engage HMT to expand the School Rebuilding Programme by a similar amount, as discussed in Spending Review negotiations. This includes increasing the number of School Rebuilding Programme projects a year from 50, to over 300.” On 4 April, the officials raise the alarm again under the same “risks and opportunities” heading and repeat the warning that some school sites are a “risk to life”. The second email adds: “We would like to increase the scale of school rebuilding.” The revelations will pile huge pressure on both No 10 and the Treasury to divert extra billions to keep schools and pupils safe, at a time when they are already facing calls to help millions of people on low incomes get through the cost-of-living crisis. On Saturday, Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, blamed years of Tory cuts to capital spending on schools and said the current problems ranged from dangerous roofs to asbestos. He said: “All children deserve to learn in high quality, safe and comfortable buildings. But in 2022-23, capital funding is £1.9bn less per year in real terms than it was in the last years of the Labour government. If the government had not cut Labour’s school rebuilding programme, £27bn more would have been spent on school and college buildings. So, while any money spent on school buildings is welcome, the scale needs to be judged against what has been cut, which is 50 times larger. “The challenges that need to be addressed are huge. And whether the issue to be addressed is potentially dangerous roofing, retrofitting for energy efficiency and to help meet climate obligations, or basic repairs, the challenge is made all the greater by the presence of asbestos in so many school buildings. The government needs to show much more ambition and urgently address these issues in a strategic way.” An official briefing in the House of Commons library dated March this year and entitled “School Building and Capital Funding” confirms the huge cuts in capital spending since the Tories came to power in 2010. It says: “Spending generally followed a downward trend between 2009-10 and 2013-14 and in the years since spending has fluctuated ... Overall, between 2009-10 and 2021-22, capital spending declined by 25% in cash terms and 29% after adjusting for inflation (2021-22 prices).” In a statement to the Commons in July 2011, the then education secretary, Michael Gove, said the design of the Labour’s Building Schools for the Future Programme “was not as efficient as it could have been”. Gove said it did not prioritise schools in the worst condition and it did not procure new buildings as cheaply as possible. In its place, Gove established the Priority School Building Programme, which he said would be available to “all schools –academies, community schools and voluntary-aided schools – and local authorities that are responsible for the maintenance of a number of schools”. It would, he said, address the problems and be available to schools with the “greatest need”. But the leaked documents confirm a gradual deterioration over the following 11 years, despite repeated warnings that a crisis was approaching. Bridget Phillipson MP, the shadow education secretary, said: “The Conservatives have failed a generation of children by slashing investment in our schools over their 12 years in power. “Their negligence is now putting lives in danger, but still the secretary of state can’t persuade the chancellor to act. Labour would build a Britain where children come first, but the Tories are standing by as England’s schools are falling down.” In 2019 the Guardian reported that more than one in six schools in England still required urgent repairsand cited warnings about schools “crumbling around teachers and pupils”. According to official data at the time, 17% (3,731) of schools were found to have buildings with “elements”, such as a roof, wall or window, in need of immediate action. Of the 21,796 schools for which information was released, 1,313 had elements that were given the worst possible condition, grade D, defined as “life expired and/or serious risk of imminent failure”. A DfE spokesperson said: “The safety of pupils and staff is paramount. We have one of the largest and most comprehensive survey programmes in Europe, and this allows us to assess and manage risk in our buildings. We prioritise buildings where there is a risk to health and safety and have invested £11.3bn since 2015 to improve the condition of school buildings and facilities. In addition, our new School Rebuilding Programme will transform the learning environment at 500 schools over the next decade.”",News/Education,"England’s crumbling schools are a ‘risk to life’, officials warn No 10",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/14/england-crumbling-schools-risk-warn-no-10-education-department-treasury
5/15/2022,"The sense of deja vu was unmistakable. For the second time this season Chelsea and Liverpool went toe-to-toe in a Wembley final and, as in the Carabao Cup at the end of February, the margins were bone-jarringly tight. Everybody knew that it could come down to one moment – a flash of magic or even an error. It was not as open as the previous instalment, the legs heavy after a long season, after everything that both clubs have lived. For Chelsea, there has been the emotional drain of the impending takeover. Liverpool, meanwhile, have had their eyes on a historic quadruple, the challenges remorseless. But there were still chances at both ends and decent ones, too. As each went begging, so the tension was ratcheted up further. For a snapshot of the drama, look no further than the 60 seconds or so from the 83rd minute when Liverpool created two openings and hit each post at the end of them. First the non-stop Luis Díaz shot against the outside of the right-hand upright and then Andy Robertson, arriving to meet a cross from the substitute James Milner, crashed his effort against the other one. Chelsea had craved what Thomas Tuchel called an “injection of positivity” and they almost got it in normal time, before the slow and inevitable trudge towards penalties, which was how the Carabao Cup final was decided, Liverpool winning a marathon shootout 11-10. There were big opportunities for Christian Pulisic and Marcos Alonso in the first half and Alonso again after the interval. The left wing-back also rattled the crossbar with a free-kick. The ball simply would not go in and nor would it for Liverpool and, in particular, DiazDíaz. And so we went once again, to the ultimate test of nerve. It was the Chelsea substitute goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga who had cracked last time, lifting his kick high over the crossbar. This time, there were more misses: César Azpilicueta in round two for Chelsea, Sadio Mané at the end of round five, whose kick to win it was brilliantly saved by Édouard Mendy, his Senegal teammate. Chelsea’s reprieve did not last. Alisson was the Liverpool hero in the second round of sudden death, going the right way to deny Mason Mount and clearing the way for the Liverpool substitute Kostas Tsimikas to win it. Red flares lit the scene. With the FA Cup, Jürgen Klopp had completed the set of trophies with Liverpool. The occasion was framed by the meeting between the teams in the previous final, which brought Liverpool their first trophy of the season – and by what has happened to Chelsea since. Three days before that previous encounter, Roman Abramovich’s hold on the club begun to unravel when Russia invaded Ukraine and Chelsea have been forced to operate under a cloud. Many things have been placed on hold and Tuchel has not tried to claim that the dressing room has been unaffected. Under beautiful blue skies and after Pete Tong had finished rolling out a few classics, Chelsea’s plan was to fire an upsurge. The atmosphere pulsed and it was Liverpool who laid down the early marker, with Luis Díaz prominently involved down the left. Tuchel preferred Trevoh Chalobah to César Azpilicueta on the right of a back three, mainly for his greater pace, but it was a worry for Chelsea when Díaz got away from him easily in the early stages to cross. Thiago could not stretch enough to reach the ball. Liverpool repeatedly worked it towards the left at the outset and Trent Alexander-Arnold created a huge chance for Díaz with a sumptuous outside-of-the-boot pass. Díaz was away from Chalobah but Édouard Mendy denied him by taking the sting out of his shot, with Chalobah then clearing from in front of the line. Chelsea battled back after a tough start to the first half and Christian Pulisic, working off the left, blew one decent chance and created an even better one for Alonso. Tuchel wanted to create an overload down the right through Reece James and Mount, with Pulisic drifting across for the final ball. Chelsea worked it nicely on 23 minutes, Mount cutting back a low cross and Pulisic arriving to sweep for the far corner. He dragged it narrowly wide but Chelsea could feel a surge of confidence. Alonso had to do better when Pulisic played him in having taken a pass from Mount, who was really in the mood. The weight on the ball from Pulisic was perfect but Alonso’s first touch was poor and it made Alisson’s block a formality. The goalkeeper had been characteristically quick to get out. Klopp had to work without Mohamed Salah from the 32nd minute, after the winger felt a twinge that will be a worry for Liverpool in the countdown to the Champions League final against Real Madrid on 28 May. On came Diogo Jota, who wasted a fine chance before the interval. Mané led a break after Mateo Kovacic had lost possession, initially going right, but when his team came back to the other side Andy Robertson crossed and Jota timed his run well. He lifted the volley high. Chelsea finished the first half with Romelu Lukaku firing a half-chance high. They restarted with the bit between their teeth and by creating a flurry of chances, with Alonso so close to the breakthrough. He dragged past the far post after Alexander-Arnold got caught under a cross from Pulisic and then hit the crossbar with a whipped free-kick from a tight angle on the right. Pulisic also worked Alisson after a Lukaku lay-off. Díaz spun on the edge of the area and rasped a shot just wide, and it felt as though the game was rising to the boil. Tuchel whipped up the Chelsea fans; he sensed that something was coming. Tuchel asked James to defend closer to Díaz to help out Chalobah but Liverpool pushed again, squeezing higher, connecting their passes and getting up the sides. There was another good chance for Jota after he was found by Naby Keïta, only for the forward to drag wide wastefully.",Sport/Football,Liverpool win FA Cup for eighth time after beating Chelsea on penalties,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/14/chelsea-liverpool-fa-cup-final-match-report
