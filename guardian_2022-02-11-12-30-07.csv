2/11/2022,"Ben Roberts-Smith told a fellow soldier he had shot an unarmed and captive Afghan teenager in the head with a pistol, and that killing him was “the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen”, the former comrade has told the federal court. Asked what had happened to a young man “shaking like a leaf” after being taken from a Toyota Hilux found with bomb-making equipment inside, the witness claimed Roberts-Smith replied: “I shot that cunt in the head. [Person 15] told me not to kill anyone on the last job. So I pulled out my 9mm, shot the cunt in the side of the head, blew his brains out. It was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.”  The soldier giving evidence, anonymised in court as Person 16, identified the body of the young Afghan in several pictures shown to him in court. The body was photographed with an AK-47 rifle. Person 16 said the young man was not carrying any weapons when he was taken captive and handcuffed. Roberts-Smith, a recipient of Australia’s highest military honour, the Victoria Cross, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing. The court has heard Person 16 and Roberts-Smith served together on an SAS rotation to Afghanistan in 2012. In November that year, on the last operation of that rotation, SAS troops were helicoptered into Fasil, in southern Uruzgan province. Person 16 gave evidence that, manning either side of a road checkpoint, Person 16 and another soldier trained their weapons on a Toyota Hilux ute that approached and waved it to a stop. Person 16 took into custody and handcuffed two of the four men inside the vehicle: an older man with a full beard and a younger man: “I made him out to be late teens … not a fully beard, a bit chubby, and shaking in terror.” “He appeared extremely nervous and trembling uncontrollably.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Neither man was armed, but, according to Person 16, the other soldier on the checkpoint reported he found components for an improvised explosive device inside the vehicle. Both were handcuffed and taken to a nearby compound for tactical questioning. Person 16 handed both prisoners over to Roberts-Smith, he told the court. He did not see the two men again. Person 16 said about 15 minutes after handing over the two men – described as PUCs, ‘persons under constraint’ – to Roberts-Smith, Roberts-Smith said over the troops’ radio “two EKIA”. EKIA is an initialism for “enemy killed in action”. In the days after the mission, Person 16 said he crossed paths with Roberts-Smith in the accommodation lines at the SAS’s Camp Russell within Australia’s Tarin Kot base. He told the court he asked Roberts-Smith: “What happened to that young fella who was shaking like a leaf?” Roberts-Smith allegedly replied: “I shot that cunt in the head. Person 15 told me not to kill anyone on the last job. So I pulled out my 9mm, shot the cunt in the side of the head, blew his brains out. It was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.” Person 16 said he could not recall what he said in reply to Roberts-Smith “because I was shocked at what he’d said”.

It would have been a career-ending move. I would have been ostracised. I also think that my personal safety ... I would have been in danger by making such allegations against some so influential, so I thought I’d just best keep quiet and move on with life.” In court on Friday, Person 16 was shown pictures of a dead Afghan male who he identified as the teenager he had taken into custody and constrained. The body was photographed with an AK-47 variant beside it. Person 16 was asked: “Did the young Afghan that you detained from the Hilux have an AK-47 variant weapon on him?” “No.” In his evidence to the court last year, Roberts-Smith was asked about the alleged killing of the Afghan teenager. He said the account was “baseless”, that he never said those words, and that the event could not have happened, because he never fired his pistol in combat while on deployment in Afghanistan. “I never had to engage with my pistol,” he told the court. Roberts-Smith also rejected assertions that he ever engaged in the practice of using “throw-downs”, a piece of compromising equipment, such as a radio or weapon, carried by soldiers and placed on the bodies of victims as a post-facto justification for their killing. Roberts-Smith has maintained all of his actions in Afghanistan abided with the Australian troops’ rules of engagement, and the Geneva Conventions. The allegation of the murder of the teenager at Fasil was first claimed in the newspapers defence as occurring on 21 October 2012. Australian War Memorial documents show that on that date, Roberts-Smith was leading a reconnaissance patrol in Char-Chineh, an action for which he would receive a commendation for distinguished service. The date of the alleged defence has been amended in the newspapers’ defence to 5 November of the same year. In his opening address to the court, Roberts-Smith’s barrister, Bruce McClintock, said the allegation was “beyond ridiculous … it’s insane”. “It’s the sort of thing that would be said by an ostentatious psychopath … my client is not that.” McClintock told the court that after the Hilux was intercepted, adults within the vehicle were detained, while the adolescent was released. In court on Friday morning, Person 16 was asked about Roberts-Smith’s wider reputation within the SAS. Person 16 said he knew of Roberts-Smith before he was posted to the SAS and said he had a “reputation as being a no-nonsense individual, a pretty straight, hard-hitting individual who didn’t suffer fools”. “He had a formidable reputation.” Person 16 said within the SAS, opinion was divided about Roberts-Smith. “There were two camps: those for and those against. Those against saw him as someone who was belligerent, a bully, would trash and tarnish others’ reputations.” The trial, before Justice Anthony Besanko, continues.",News/Australia news,"Ben Roberts-Smith called alleged  killing of unarmed Afghan teenager ‘beautiful thing’, court hears",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/11/ben-roberts-smith-called-alleged-killing-of-unarmed-afghan-teenager-beautiful-thing-court-hears
2/11/2022,"While many in the media saw the National Press Club speeches of Brittany Higgins and Grace Tame as a “call to action, a warning against complacency in an election year”, Sky News Australia’s Andrew Bolt had his usual contrary take. On his Wednesday evening program, the Murdoch columnist described the outpouring of anguish and frustration from the two young women as an “orgy of hate that should shame the press club” and an example of our “sick” political culture.  It reminded us of his treatment of another Australian of the Year, Adam Goodes, when he accused the AFL great of being racially divisive for calling out a 13-year-old girl in the crowd who racially vilified him. Bolt couldn’t see past what he characterised as personal and unfair attacks on the prime minister. He even claimed the audience heard “not one serious practical policy from the two speakers”. The Herald Sun columnist jumped to the defence of the prime minister, who he had dismissed only a few days earlier as “a man with the fight beaten out of him”. Tame “went for Morrison’s throat”, Bolt told his Sky viewers, while Higgins threw the PM’s apology “back in his face”. There was ‘unbridled hate’ for Scott Morrison at National Press Club #auspol https://t.co/R6jtFyz8EU His stablemate Chris Kenny, an associate editor on the Australian, said it was “part of a campaign” to weaponise sexual harassment and abuse as a party-political issue. “There is no doubt they deserve admiration for their public advocacy, their calls for better support and justice for victims of sexual assaults,” Kenny said. “But none of this gives them a free pass from scrutiny or accountability about the highly politicised nature of their media-driven campaigning.” Tame is of course used to being “commodified” by parts of the media, telling the audience she had been “re-victimised, commodified, objectified, sensationalised, delegitimised, gaslit, thrown under the bus by the biased mainstream media”. With an election looming, TV current affairs shows are rolling out their features on the prime minister and his challenger, Albanese. As the election looms, we ask voters: Does Anthony Albanese have what it takes to be PM? Monday on #4Corners #AusPol2022 pic.twitter.com/r88NHmjbVt On Monday the ABC’s Four Corners talked to undecided voters about what they thought of Morrison and how he had handled the past three years. In an attempt to be even-handed the program used “two political research companies and a range of community forums to recruit undecided voters”, according to executive producer Sally Neighbour. Next week reporter Sean Nicholls will subject Albanese to the same treatment. After his toughest weeks in the top job, the Prime Minister fights back with his secret weapon. SUNDAY on #60Mins, can Jenny Morrison save her husband’s career? pic.twitter.com/qqZ8DSJGpO Nine’s 60 Minutes took a different approach, sending a cheeky Karl Stefanovic to trot around Scott and Jenny’s Kirribilli House kitchen, margarita in hand, for a “behind the scenes” look as “Scott Morrison fights back”. “Can Jenny Morrison save the election?” the promo asks. Viewers are also in line for something special with the PM’s ukulele rendition of the 1977 hit April in the Sun in Cuba. We are yet to learn whether the uke was a souvenir from Morrison’s ill-fated January 2020 in the sun in Hawaii. Get you a Prime Minister who can do both (sing the same verse of April Sun In Cuba twice) pic.twitter.com/AQ8at4Gzpb A day earlier, Laura Tingle, ABC 7.30’s political editor, reminded everyone of where the feminist insurgency being played out in the media began, with a shout-out to Four Corners reporter Louise Milligan, whose Inside the Canberra Bubble story was instrumental in persuading Higgins to speak to news.com.au political editor Samantha Maiden. Maiden’s story is up for scoop of the year at the 66th Walkley Awards on 25 February, a gala dinner in Sydney that has been rescheduled twice due to Covid. On a day Parliament has apologised to women who have suffered from its toxic culture, I applaud @Milliganreports whose ‘Inside the Canberra Bubble’ @4corners played a huge role in blowing it open. And send a big cheerio to those male reporters who greeted it with such hostility Lisa Wilkinson and Ten’s Project team, who did the first television interview with Higgins, have been nominated in the public service journalism category for a series of three stories. Interestingly, the three journalists are competing against each other in another category, coverage of a major news event or issue. Maiden for the Higgins story, Milligan for Inside the Canberra Bubble and Tingle (and James Elton) for her 7.30 coverage. With Leigh Sales stepping down from 7.30 in late June after the federal election, speculation is rife about who will replace her. Sales has anchored the key show for 12 years and her decision to walk away was a well kept secret at Aunty until she revealed it at the end of the show. “There’s nothing wrong, other than I just feel a strong sense of it being time to pass the baton to the next runner in the race and to take a break,” a teary Sales said. “The end of an election cycle feels like a good time to move on to something new at the ABC. Congratulating my colleague & friend @leighsales on her incredible work for 7.30. She espouses the finest virtues of public broadcasting journalism & I admire her. We’ll make most of her remaining time at 7.30 until June & can’t wait to see what she does next at the ABC. A legend pic.twitter.com/ZrBDMDKgfq “I’ve tried to shut down wafflers, call out bullshit, hold powerful people to account, expose lies, incompetence and exaggeration in all political parties and on all issues, and present facts even when they’re unpopular or inconvenient. I have truly tried my absolute hardest on behalf of you at home to do that every single time I’ve sat at the desk.” There are a several moving parts at ABC news at the moment. The job of news director is yet to be filled after the departure of Gaven Morris, Fran Kelly hasn’t revealed what she will do now she’s out of RN Breakfast, and now Sales has to find a suitable berth too. How many spare roles are there for senior ABC journalists? Although Sales said she was staying with Aunty, it wouldn’t be a stretch to imagine her taking over from Channel Nine political editor Chris Uhlmann. Uhlmann, Nine’s political editor, has said he’ll retire at the end of the year. Two of the Australian’s “exclusive” stories this week were questionable, but for entirely different reasons. Reporters from the Age and the Guardian say there was a midnight embargo on a report from the Climate Council that was published several hours earlier at 6.34pm by the Australian. The Australian’s bureau chief, Joe Kelly, told Weekly Beast the report by Sarah Ison “was published ahead of embargo by accident”. He didn’t say how it ended up with a big red exclusive tag on top of the story though. Hey Oz come get your 'exclusive', it left home before it was ready and broke the midnight embargo 🤗 pic.twitter.com/ggEwdliLJk It took the Australian’s Sharri Markson more than 30 years to dig up some dirt on the leader of the opposition, Anthony Albanese, but she is nothing if not tenacious. Exclusive: Anthony Albanese criticised capitalism and family wealth as causes of social injustice while suggesting incomes above $100k a year were not deserved.He made the remarks while arguing for death duties as assistant general secretary of NSW Labor.https://t.co/CEa7ISiLO2 The investigations editor’s “exclusive” story on page one of the Oz on Thursday was about Albo’s dark past as a “radical leftie”. His crime was to argue for an inheritance tax at a Labor conference in Tasmania – five years before he even entered parliament as an MP. At the time he was assistant general secretary of NSW Labor, having graduated from activist youth, a period now referred to as the “Hot Albo” era. (The Oz even used the famous “Hot Albo” photo to illustrate the article.) The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, whose office might have been the source of the ancient speech, was at hand for the killer quote. “Mr Albanese posed a ‘significant threat to Australia’s economic future with his socialist ideals and lack of economic experience, having never held a Treasury portfolio’,” the story quoted him as saying. Twitter was fierce, with one chap saying: “Looking forward to your deep dive ‘exclusive’ into what Albo said in primary school too, Sharri”. With Australia’s longest-running drama set to end in June if a new broadcaster isn’t found, the future of Neighbours was a hot topic this week. Even the Victorian opposition leader, Matthew Guy, was prompted into talking about it. Unfortunately Guy got his soapies mixed up, telling reporters he remembers “Alf’s white house” on the show back in the 1980s. With Neighbours facing the axe, it's time to share your memories. Even if some got it wrong... pic.twitter.com/YcIlpOk9aA Alf Stewart is of course one of the original characters from our other long-running soapie, Home and Away.",News/Australia news,Morrison mixes margaritas and ukuleles as Tame and Higgins leave Bolt shaken ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2022/feb/11/morrison-mixes-margaritas-and-ukuleles-as-tame-and-higgins-leave-bolt-shaken
