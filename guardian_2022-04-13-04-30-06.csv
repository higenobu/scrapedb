4/13/2022,"Military bunkers in the UK are being upgraded so that they can be used to store US nuclear weapons again after 14 years of standing empty, according to US defence budget documents. In the Biden administration’s 2023 defence budget request, the UK was added to the list of countries where infrastructure investment is under way at “special weapons” storage sites, alongside Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey – all countries where the US stores an estimated 100 B61 nuclear bombs. Hans Kristensen, the director of the nuclear information project at the Federation of American Scientists (FAS), who first reported on the budget item, said he believed the British site being upgraded is the US airbase at RAF Lakenheath, 100 km north-east of London. The US withdrew its B61 munitions from Lakenheath in 2008, marking the end of more than half a century of maintaining a US nuclear stockpile in the UK. At the time of the withdrawal, the gravity bombs were widely seen as militarily obsolete and hopes were higher for further disarmament by the nuclear weapons powers. That optimism has since been dashed, against the backdrop of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, his regime’s nuclear threats against Nato, and extensive nuclear weapon modernisation programmes pursued by both the US and Russia. As part of the US plan, the B61 has been given a new lease of life with a guidance system, the B61-12 variant, due to go into full production in May. The 2023 budget request says that Nato “is wrapping up a 13-year, $384m infrastructure investment program at storage sites in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the UK, and Turkey to upgrade security measures, communication systems, and facilities.” In the 1990s, RAF Lakenheath had 33 underground storage vaults, where 110 B61 bombs were stored, according to the FAS. Since their withdrawal the vaults have been mothballed. Kristensen said he believes the vaults are now being upgraded so the new B61-12 bombs can be stored there, if needed. The Biden administration has been careful not to make any moves that might be seen as escalatory in the nuclear arena in response to Putin’s announcement he would put Russia’s nuclear forces on higher alert a few days after his invasion of Ukraine. The US has canceled scheduled tests of its intercontinental ballistic missiles, for example. For the same reason, Kristensen said he doubted the Biden administration is planning to increase the US nuclear stockpile in Europe. When the new B61-12 bombs are delivered, expected next year, they will replace older models already there. Instead, he thought the Lakenheath upgrade is intended to provided more flexibility to move the nuclear weapons around Europe. “One of the things they have talked about is protecting the deterrent against Russia’s improved cruise missiles capabilities,” Kristensen said. “So they could be trying to beef up the readiness of more sites without them necessarily receiving nukes, so that they have the options to move things around in a contingency if they need to.” Britain has become keen to take a more assertive role when it comes to its own nuclear deterrent, and last year announced it would increase its own stockpile of Trident nuclear warheads by 40% to 260, the first such increase since the end of the cold war. Whitehall sources say that Britain has “a clearer appreciation” of the UK’s role as a nuclear weapons state in a renewed era of state competition with Russia and China. The UK Ministry of Defence did not comment on the upgrade mentioned in the US budget. One British official said: “We won’t provide anything on this as it relates to the storage of nuclear weapons.” But the news comes just four months after the arrival in Lakenheath of the first of a new generation of nuclear-capable US combat aircraft, the F-35A Lightning II, the first such deployment in Europe. Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said the upgrade of the UK storage facilities is “an early sign that the US and Nato are preparing to engage in a protracted and maybe heightened standoff with Putin’s Russia.” “The administration should provide some clarity about the military necessity and goals of possibly bringing nuclear weapons back to the UK,” Kimball added. The developments in Europe are part of a broader retreat from arms control. The Biden administration’s nuclear posture review, which has been sent to Congress but not yet declassified, is reported not to contain the changes the president pledged during his campaign. In 2020, he said he would formally declare the sole purpose of nuclear weapons to be deterrence of a nuclear attack against the United States or its allies. But the review leaves open the option of using nuclear arms to respond to non-nuclear threats as well. The nuclear disarmament group CND said the “quiet announcement” by the US amounted to more militarisation at a time of growing risk and would add to the risks faced by the British public. Kate Hudson, the general secretary of CND, said she feared it could lead to US warheads being redeployed in the UK. “Nuclear weapons don’t make us safe – they make us a target,” she added.",News/World news,UK military vaults upgraded to store new US nuclear weapons,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/uk-military-vaults-upgraded-to-store-new-us-nuclear-weapons
4/13/2022,"Time Out will stop publishing its London print edition after 54 years, becoming the latest in a long line of media outlets to abandon their physical presence and go online only. Generations of Londoners used to rely on the listings and entertainment magazine to plan nights out, circling events in the magazine and reading reviews of what was on in the capital – but the final print copies will now be printed at the end of June. Time Out was originally a paid-for magazine but switched to being a free publication in 2012, after the internet undermined its traditional business model by making it easy to find event listings online. It survived another decade as a slimmed-down, advertising-supported publication – but as a magazine that promoted opportunities for going out and relied on being picked up by commuters, it struggled during the pandemic, when people worked from home and venues were closed. Time Out’s parent company said the pandemic had hastened a “transformation that was already under way” and it would now focus on its online listings business as well as its branded food courts around the world in cities such as Lisbon and New York. A Time Out spokesperson said it was in consultation with staff on the print publication about potential job losses. Free print publications have struggled in recent years due to a variety of factors including advertisers taking money away from the format, commuters becoming more likely to spend time on their phones and the rising cost of paper – which quickly mounts up when hundreds of thousands of copies need to be printed. The men’s magazine Shortlist and the NME music paper have closed their physical editions, while London’s Evening Standard newspaper has racked up substantial losses in recent years. Time Out was founded by Tony Elliott in 1968 as part of a wave of publications that sprang up in the era, originally including radical political articles and investigative journalism. After retaining ownership until 2010, he allowed external investment from a private equity firm that enabled the company to expand into other businesses. On his death in 2020, the company described Elliot as a “visionary publisher” who was “a tireless champion of city culture”.",News/Media,Time’s up for Time Out as London print edition of magazine to be axed,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/12/time-up-for-time-out-london-print-edition-listing-entertainment-magazine-axed
4/13/2022,"Has Rishi Sunak’s week from hell saved his neighbour in No 10? Until recently the chancellor was seen as the safest choice to replace Boris Johnson if MPs decided the prime minister’s position was untenable. The chancellor had positioned himself as the antidote to chaos in Downing Street, using some of Johnson’s most difficult moments to force through his favoured policies such as the national insurance rise. But now he has lost his moral high ground after being fined along with the prime minister for attending a lockdown birthday party. Much has changed since “red wall” Tory MPs met in January to launch “the pork pie plot” to submit letters of no-confidence in Johnson’s leadership amid almost daily revelations about lockdown-breaching parties in Downing Street. There was a consensus among more experienced MPs that Johnson should only be challenged when a vote of no confidence could be sure to succeed – meaning a significant number held off sending in letters to the 1922 Committee. The moment to send the letters would be when Johnson was fined, they said. Some still believe more letters could yet go in now fixed-penalty notices have been issued. One predicted Sunak would decide his position was untenable and resign – which could put pressure on the prime minister to do the same. But in the immediate aftermath of the fines, most MPs are pausing for thought. One senior MP, a critic of Johnson, said they were close to despair at their colleagues. Another admitted that “timing has been on the PM’s side” with the delay in the Met’s investigation and with the announcement coming while most MPs are away for Easter recess. At least three public critics of the PM have now argued against a challenge – Sir Roger Gale, the Scottish Tory leader, Douglas Ross, and Andrew Bridgen. Gale said he believed the PM should not lead the party into the next election but said rebels must wait. Bridgen said war in Ukraine meant a challenge was impossible but this was “not the end of this matter”. Robert Goodwill, a former Home Office minister, said he was deeply concerned by the prospect of a leadership void should things escalate in Ukraine, especially when the west has warned of reprisals if Russia uses chemical weapons. “The person who would most welcome a leadership contest would be President Putin,” he said. But for others, there is a more self-serving reason to swerve a contest: the absence of a plausible successor. “Successors are all damaged, from national insurance or visas or silly remarks, that means an unpredictable contest and you can’t have that in a war,” one MP said. Most MPs had been comfortable with the prospect of Sunak replacing Johnson, even if he was not their first choice. Although there were always some doubts about Sunak’s ability to connect with the public, many MPs admired his handling of the pandemic, his lockdown scepticism and his desire to get a hold on public spending. But after a week of headlines about his wife’s non-dom status which brought his enormous family wealth into the spotlight, ill feeling exploded towards the chancellor from MPs already irritated by the rise in national insurance and a spring statement lacking tangible extra support for the cost of living crisis. Liz Truss, once seen as the members’ darling, is not widely popular with colleagues who were unnerved by some comments she has made as foreign secretary, including that Britons should travel to fight in Ukraine. Priti Patel has seen her star fall after a series of Home Office scandals, Michael Gove would be unlikely to succeed on his third attempt and Sajid Javid has recently had to admit himself that he was a non-dom before coming into parliament. As things stand, Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, is the only cabinet minister to garner any sort of praise from MPs. Outside the cabinet, Jeremy Hunt is still viewed with suspicion by many Brexiters and the outsider candidate, Tom Tugendhat, has no ministerial experience. Much could change in the coming weeks – especially with local elections and an extremely tricky byelection potentially on the horizon in Wakefield. “I think the elections are the real test now,” one MP said. “I’m sure the PM will be interested to see what the voters really make of all this.”",News/Politics,Sunak no longer the Tory antidote to Johnson’s leadership chaos,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/12/sunak-no-longer-tory-antidote-johnson-leadership-chaos
4/13/2022,"A Briton who has been fighting with the Ukrainian armed forces in the besieged city of Mariupol has been forced to surrender along with his unit to the Russians because they have run out of food and ammunition. Aiden Aslin, from Newark, joined Ukraine’s marines in 2018 but has told friends and family that he and his comrades cannot hold out any longer as the Russians gradually tighten their grip on the southern port city. Aslin’s mother, Ang Wood, told the BBC that her son’s unit had “put up one hell of a fight” but had to call it a day because they had “no weapons left”. In an interview, she called on UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, to find a way to “take Putin down”. Russian troops have been besieging the city on the Sea of Azov since the beginning of March. The territory controlled by Ukrainian forces has gradually shrank to a few central areas. Aslin tweeted under the name Cossackgundi, although he has become increasingly unable to do so, leaving the administration of the account in the hands of a friend who will continue to comment on the war under his user name. Aslin fought for the Syrian Kurdish YPG against Islamic State between 2015 and 2017 before moving to Ukraine. A friend, Brennan Philips, said Aslin “can’t get out … can’t fight back” and added: “I’m sure if they had a bullet left, they would have shot it.” In a video filmed in February before the war, Aslin said he had “originally wanted to be a cop” but decided to join to fight Islamic State so that he would not “sit here and complain about everything, but go do something about it”, and that he recognised that a war with Russia could mean “a lot of us will die, get seriously injured”. In a Facebook post on Monday, the last Ukrainian soldiers defending Mariupol said they were “running out of ammunition” and expected to be killed or taken prisoner very soon. “We were bombed from airplanes and shot at by artillery and tanks. We have been doing everything possible and impossible. But any resource has the potential to run out,” said the 36th brigade.",News/World news,British man fighting in Ukraine forced to surrender to Russians,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/british-man-fighting-in-ukraine-forced-to-surrender-to-russians
