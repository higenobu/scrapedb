5/12/2022,"Most of the Jamaicans facing deportation from the UK on a controversial Home Office charter flight next week arrived in the country as children, according to analysis passed to the Guardian. It is not known how many Jamaican nationals are due to be on the 18 May flight but numbers on the last four Jamaica deportation flights have been decreasing steadily – from 17 to 13, to seven and then four. Of 20 Jamaicans detained in three immigration removal centres – Harmondsworth and Colnbrook near Heathrow airport and Brook House near Gatwick airport – 13 out of 20 arrived in the UK as children, according to analysis by the campaign group Movement for Justice. Of the 13, 11 arrived at the age of 12 or under. The issue of those who arrived in the UK as children is one of the most contentious on Jamaica charter flights. In November 2020 before one such flight an agreement was reached between the Home Office and Jamaica’s high commissioner, Seth Ramocan, not to deport those who arrived in the UK under the age of 12. It is not known if discussions are under way to replicate an agreement of this kind for next week’s flight. In 2018 a Home Office-commissioned report from the former prisons and probation ombudsman Stephen Shaw called for a new approach to the policy of detaining and removing people who had committed crimes but spent most of their lives in Britain. The Home Office has not implemented the recommendation. Jamaica deportation flights are also controversial because many of those earmarked for deportation have Windrush connections. At least 10 of those in the analysis had Windrush connections through grandparents, aunts and uncles. The youngest of those surveyed was 22 and the oldest 49. Seventeen had lived in the UK for more than 20 years. At least 32 children will lose their fathers if their deportations go ahead, including a newborn and a one-month-old baby. Of those surveyed, 17 had British partners and one man was a carer for his wife. Two spent time in care and several had learning difficulties. Eighteen reported mental health problems including anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, bipolar, psychosis and post-traumatic stress disorder. One had been recognised as a victim of trafficking by the Home Office. Five others were potential victims of trafficking after reporting being groomed into criminal activity as children. One man had no criminal convictions but overstayed his visa due to flight delays during the pandemic. While some had served long sentences for serious offences – the longest among those surveyed being 16 years – some had served much shorter sentences, with the shortest being one year and three months. Some had not reoffended for several years, including one man who had not done so for nine years and another who had not reoffended for six years. Offences ranged from manslaughter and sexual assault to firearms and robbery offences. Eight reported they were victims of torture or abuse and said they had scarring on their bodies. Antonia Bright, the national organiser of Movement for Justice, said: “This is transportation not deportation. This flight is full of people who’ve been raised in the UK since childhood.” Steve Valdez-Symonds, the refugee and migrants’ rights programme director at Amnesty International, said: “Once again the arbitrary vindictiveness of Home Office deportation policy and practice is on display. Many of the people subjected to these cruel expulsions – who have served their time for whatever they have done – are long connected to this country, including people wrongly excluded from their rights to British citizenship during childhood.” Bella Sankey, the director of the charity Detention Action, said: “If someone has lived in Britain most of their lives then they are British in all but name and they are our responsibility.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We make no apology for seeking to remove foreign criminals and return those with no right to stay here. “Those being detained for removal on this charter include foreign national offenders who have been convicted of very serious offences … Our priority will always be to keep our communities safe and since January 2019 we have removed more than 10,000 foreign criminals.”",News/UK news,"Most Jamaicans facing deportation flight came to UK as children, study shows",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/12/most-jamaicans-facing-deportation-flight-came-uk-children-study
5/12/2022,"More than 100 fixed-penalty notices have now been handed out for breaches of lockdown rules in Downing Street and Whitehall, the Metropolitan police has announced. The force previously said it had issued more than 50 such fines, but it had not updated the public on the progress of its investigation in recent weeks while the local election campaign was taking place. In a brief statement on Thursday, it said the total had reached twice that. The investigation, which covers 12 separate events, is still ongoing. It is understood one of the gatherings for which fines have begun to be issued is the cheese and wine party which Number 10 aides were filmed joking about. In the leaked rehearsal video, from December 2020, Johnson’s then director of communications, Allegra Stratton, was seen struggling to answer the question of whether a Christmas party had taken place. One colleague suggests: “It wasn’t a party, it was cheese and wine.” Stratton subsequently resigned. Downing Street confirmed that the prime minister has still received only one fine, for a birthday party in June 2020. His wife, Carrie Johnson, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, were fined for the same event. Boris Johnson has told friends he believes he will not receive further fines, and said publicly last week that he had not yet been sent a questionnaire from the Met about the leaving do of his aide Lee Cain, at which he is believed to have poured drinks. Several sources have suggested a separate party was held on the same night, hosted by Carrie Johnson upstairs in the No 10 flat, at which Abba was loudly playing. Johnson is expected to argue that while he was present at that gathering, it was only to interview a possible candidate for a job. Some fixed penalty notices have already been issued for the “bring your own booze” garden drinks organised by Johnson’s principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, on 20 May 2020. Johnson admitted attending that gathering for a few minutes, but insisted he believed it was a work event. The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, responding to the Met’s statement, said: “Boris Johnson stood up in parliament and said Covid rules were followed in No 10 at all times. Now a shocking 100 fines have been issued by the police over Partygate. It shows the scale of the law-breaking in Johnson’s Downing Street and the extent of his lies.” Even before this latest update, polling carried out by YouGov suggested that 80% of the public believe Johnson has lied about Partygate, while just 8% think he has told the truth. Many Conservative MPs are awaiting the publication of the senior civil servant Sue Gray’s full report on lockdown breaches in Downing Street, before deciding whether to move against the prime minister. So far, the Cabinet Office has only published a pared down version of her findings, after she paused her work while the Met investigation took place. Johnson also faces an investigation by the House of Commons privileges committee into whether he misled parliament by reassuring MPs when the Partygate stories first emerged that “all guidance was followed completely” in Downing Street. Durham police said last week they would investigate claims that Keir Starmer broke lockdown rules by eating a takeaway curry at a campaign event last year. The Labour leader, a former director of public prosecutions, announced on Monday that he is confident no rules were broken – but will resign if he is issued with a fine.",News/Politics,Partygate: Met says over 100 fines now issued for lockdown breaches,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/12/partygate-met-says-over-100-fines-issued-lockdown-breaches-downing-street
5/12/2022,"Among all the toxins in the Pandora’s Box of chemical pollutants that humans have released upon the world, PFAS are particularly disturbing. PFAS – per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances – are nicknamed “forever chemicals” for their ubiquity, persistence and toxicity. They are used in household items including non-stick pans, waterproof fabrics, and microwave popcorn bags, and can contaminate water, air, soil, crops and animal products. They accumulate in the blood, bones and tissues of living things and do not degrade. PFAS impair human immune systems, making us more susceptible to diseases – even those we’ve been vaccinated against. Researchers associate the chemicals with liver disease, obesity, thyroid disorders, and certain cancers, among other health problems. These observations generally pertain to the relatively few PFAS we have researched, including PFOA and PFOS; PFAS belong to a massive family of chemicals, thousands of them unstudied and potentially harmful. Now, for the first time, scientists have found a way to remove PFAS from the human body: by donating blood. A new study published in JAMA Network Open tracked PFAS levels in 285 Australian firefighters, who are regularly exposed to PFAS in firefighting foam and accrue high levels of the chemicals in their bodies. Over a year, one group of firefighters donated plasma every six weeks, another donated blood every 12 weeks, and a third group acted as a control. “This randomized clinical trial showed that regular blood or plasma donations result in a significant reduction in serum PFAS levels for participants,” the study’s authors wrote. Blood donors reduced their PFAS levels by 10%, and plasma donors reduced theirs by 30%. Both groups maintained their reduction for at least three months post-trial. The study did not explore whether a reduction in PFAS in the blood necessarily leads to better health. It’s almost ironic: while the $4tn global wellness industry bends over backwards to sell us dubious detox products, there is an accessible, easy, and free way to genuinely rid our bloodstreams of toxins. And blood is always in high demand. The American Red Cross – which supplies 40% of the country’s blood – saw its worst blood shortage in more than a decade this January. Blood donation services have traditionally invoked altruism to attract and retain donors; perhaps donations will increase as people learn that giving blood may be in their self-interest, too. (And in the case of donating plasma, donors are often financially compensated.) When you donate PFAS you are effectively pawning off your PFAS on the blood recipient. There’s something morally icky about that, though it’s important to remember that PFAS are already ubiquitous, and blood recipients generally need blood much more urgently than they need to worry about PFAS. But the idea of offloading toxin-laced blood does raise health and ethical questions. “This is a big controversy. This is a big question,” Dr Bruce Lanphear, a co-author of the study and a researcher specializing in childhood exposures to toxins, said. “Should we be testing blood for chemicals, at least for preemies? Should we be testing it for all people?” He pointed out that premature babies can require multiple full blood transfusions at a time when they are “exquisitely sensitive to toxic chemicals”. Increased public understanding of chemical contaminants in blood “raises questions about the safety of the blood supply”, says Lanphear. “And of course, there’s going to be a lot of disbelief, a lot of dismissal of this because that’s pretty inconvenient.” “The Red Cross and the FDA work together to ensure the blood supply is as safe as possible, and individuals should not worry about the safety of donating or receiving blood,” Dr Susan Stramer, vice president of scientific affairs at the American Red Cross Blood Services, wrote by email. “At this time, there are no regulatory limitations on [PFAS] in blood due to the absence of any documented evidence of harm. No study has shown a detrimental effect of such substances in blood for donors or recipients.” And donations save lives, after all. Either way, more research on the effects of PFAS is needed – urgently. Not only is there no established threshold for “safe” PFAS levels in blood, the US has no national drinking water standard for PFAS contamination either. Tightening regulations and changes in manufacturing could lessen our exposure to some PFAS. From 1999 to 2014, national blood levels of PFOA and PFOS declined by more than 60% and 80% respectively, according to the CDC. Last year, the European Union adopted a plan to phase out all but essential uses of PFAS. In the US, Maine has passed legislation banning the sale of new carpets or fabric treatments that contain intentionally added PFAS as of 2023, and the sale of any products containing added PFAS by 2030. Connecticut, Minnesota, New York, Vermont and Washington have also taken steps to limit PFAS production. For now, we know that there is an “ongoing balance between exposure and elimination”, of PFAS in the body, as study lead author Dr Robin Gasiorowski puts it. By giving blood or plasma, “you can significantly speed up that elimination part”.

5/12/2022,"There is a word for what is about to hit the UK economy and it is stagflation. The combination of two dreaded terms in the economic lexicon – stagnation and inflation – should send ripples of apprehension and unease through the corridors of the Treasury’s Horse Guards Road offices and the Bank of England’s home on Threadneedle Street. Once countries are locked into a period of low growth and high inflation, experience suggests the exit is usually painful. And maybe it won’t even be weak growth that is the problem ahead, but a full-blown recession. Earlier this week, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) became one of the first forecasters to predict a recession in the second half of this year, though its modelling showed it would be a modest affair such that the term stagnation was still appropriate. After the official growth figures for the first quarter came in on Thursday below expectations at 0.8%, when the average forecast by City economists was 1%, the talk is no longer about whether there will be a recession, but how deep. The monthly figure for March GDP growth was negative at -0.1%, indicating that economic activity had slumped since January’s 1% increase and a recession could be on its way at an even faster pace. Never mind waiting for the autumn, the periods covering the spring and summer could be negative. “Suddenly, our forecasts that GDP will be flat in both the second quarter and the third quarter seem pretty optimistic,” said Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics. “A contraction in GDP or a recession now feels a bit more likely.” It feels like the strength of the economy has drained away since February at an alarming pace. And the situation would have been much worse were it not for the 1.7% month-on-month rebound in construction output after the drag faded from Storm Eunice in February. Kristin Forbes, the former Bank of England policymaker, told MPs on the Treasury select committee on Wednesday that the UK found itself in a bad place at the moment. If a country has higher energy prices, a falling exchange rate, trade restrictions that push up goods prices, expectations among businesses and consumers of much higher inflation in a year’s time and a tight labour market, forcing wages higher, though not as high as inflation, the outlook was especially tough. Add into the mix a decade of modest inflation going into the pandemic, which most other countries have not had, pointing to a lack of underlying inflation in their economies, and you have an even worse situation. “The UK is the only country to tick every box,” she said. Making matters worse, business investment remains 9.1% below its pre-pandemic level, despite a huge tax incentive to buy new equipment, and the trade deficit has widened again. Can Rishi Sunak wait and watch all this play out in front of him? It seems hard to believe that Tory MPs will tolerate the hardship caused to their constituents after a local election result that pointed to even harsher defeats ahead. Citizens Advice said this morning it is breaking records every month, and not in a good way. It has seen more desperate people so far this year than in the whole of 2021. Demand for food bank vouchers has rocketed and struggling families cannot afford many of the basic necessities of life. Sunak is shy of increasing welfare payments to the bottom third of people who are the worst affected. It’s an idealogical blind spot that by the end of the year could cost him his job. As Torsten Bell, the head of the Resolution Foundation said: “This year is a disaster for poorer households and you do not get through that with no answer for them.”",News/Business,A UK recession seems certain – the only question is how deep?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/12/a-uk-recession-seems-certain-the-only-question-is-how-deep
5/12/2022,"It is now five months since the Omicron variant was first detected in the UK – and although its impact was less severe than many initially feared, it’s estimated that more than 30 million people in England have been infected, with 200,000 hospitalised and even more suffering with long Covid across the UK, and over 20,000 deaths. Behind these headline figures lies a more complicated reality, yielding important lessons about the impact of government-mandated restrictions that could help end disagreements between some scientists and help us deal with future waves. The first Omicron (BA.1) wave, beginning in December, showed us that it was possible to get over a peak without a lockdown. The second (BA.2) wave from March to April was the first time a wave peaked in England without any government-mandated restrictions, as all legal mandates ended on 24 February. And because England chose a different path on restrictions to the other home nations (and other western European countries) during the Omicron waves, this provides a very good “natural experiment” to assess how much difference the varying levels of restrictions made. International comparisons do have limitations, but in the absence of better evidence to judge the effectiveness of Covid restrictions, such natural experiments provide a useful guide, especially in comparing the UK home nations, which have similar populations, age structures, climate/seasons, healthcare systems and population-level immunity to Covid. I should stress that given the uncertainty of the evidence at the time, it was perfectly reasonable for the home nations to choose different paths – and the extra restrictions outside England had widespread public support. But what will perhaps be surprising to many is that England has actually had a similar rate of infection and a lower rate of Covid deaths during the Omicron wave – and since 19 July 2021, England’s “freedom day” – than Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, despite having far fewer mandatory restrictions, and none after 24 February. This “natural experiment” shows that having more mandates did not lead to better outcomes. There was also no significant difference in overall excess mortality across the home nations to the end of 2021. And England’s is now likely to be lower as – somewhat remarkably, given the Omicron wave – excess mortality is negative in England for 2022 so far, with the lowest age-standardised mortality rates (the best comparator to previous years, as it takes population ageing into account) since the series began in 2001. Comparisons with countries in western Europe are more problematic as there are variations in how testing regimes operate and how deaths are coded – so data on excess deaths tends to be a better guide. But even here we see that although the UK did the third most tests, it had one of the lowest number of cases in western Europe. The UK has also had the lowest excess deaths in Europe from January to date – and one of the lowest since 19 July 2021 – despite having few restrictions. This shows that there has been no clear relationship between levels of excess mortality and the intensity or longevity of mandatory restrictions across western Europe once vaccines had been rolled out. (The much higher Covid death rates in central and eastern Europe are mainly due to lower levels of vaccination.) Last autumn, many were calling for England to follow the example of Germany (and other European countries) in bringing back mask mandates, vaccine passports and other restrictions, as they had lower case rates at the time. But as I and many others pointed out, once vaccination programmes were complete, these strategies were likely to be simply postponing infections to the winter, when health systems would have been less able to cope – which is indeed what happened. Germany has had more infections and excess deaths than the UK during the Omicron wave and since last July, despite having had earlier lockdowns and more government-mandated measures for far longer. This is partly because voluntary changes to behaviour are as important as those mandated by the government (a majority of people in England still self-isolated and wore masks, even when the mandates ended). And also because it is now population levels of immunity (particularly in older age groups) – either through vaccination or natural infection– that really determines the level of deaths due to Covid. Restrictions make little difference in a highly immune population. Since the removal of restrictions in England, we have also seen an improvement in measures of personal wellbeing, economic performance and unemployment – all of which are very important to our health. New variants are all but inevitable, and there is no guarantee they will be milder than Omicron. We must be prepared for this and use this time to properly establish the evidence for the effectiveness of restrictions in case they are needed in the future. And given the focus is more likely to be on persuasion and relying on people to continue taking personal responsibility rather than mandates, we need those asking the public to follow the guidance to be credible – whether politicians, doctors or scientists. We as scientists must regain that trust by accepting our mistakes, explaining what went wrong and what has been learned; and politicians must follow the rules they make. And finally we must also look at what lessons we can learn from those countries that have had much lower excess death rates than ours (such as Norway) and we owe it to all those who have died and their loved ones to have a proper public inquiry that looks at all the decisions made over the past two years to ensure we learn from our mistakes and see how we can do better in the future.

5/12/2022,"They have claws, 10 legs, can produce hundreds of clones of themselves and have escaped from confinement to potentially run amok across the United States. The ecological threat posed by the marbled crayfish has now prompted prosecutors to wield invasive species laws in an attempt to curb the spread of the peripatetic crustaceans. An Ohio woman who sold hundreds of marbled crayfish online has pleaded guilty to offenses under the Lacey Act, a US law preventing the transport of certain wildlife across state lines, after raising the crayfish in a huge tank in her home and selling them to people across 36 different states. Allison Spaulding used eBay and Craigslist to sell various species of guppies and crayfish bred in her aquarium in Mount Vernon, Ohio and faces a maximum penalty of a year in prison and up to $100,000 in fines, although a federal judge is set to consider a lesser penalty under a plea deal. The case is understood to be the first such enforcement action aimed at stemming the advance of the marbled crayfish, which has already exploded in huge numbers across countries as diverse as Germany and Madagascar. Wildlife officials fear the creature is now threatening to gain a claw hold in the US, where it is banned in several states but not nationally. Spaulding was prosecuted after Ohio introduced a state rule in 2020 naming the crayfish as an injurious species. “We are trying to keep them off the landscape as they have the potential for serious environmental damage,” said Justus Nethero, wildlife investigator at the Ohio department of natural resources. “I hope this will be the springboard to this crayfish being federally listed as an invasive species, because these things have to start somewhere. I’d like to think this will change something.” Nethero said he was “shocked” at the scale of Spaulding’s crayfish enterprise, which involved a 50-gallon tank of water with sand in it, filled with approximately 400 to 500 marbled crayfish. During a visit in May 2021 that Nethero said was cordial, investigators saw the tank. “Allison was very friendly,” he said. “This wasn’t like (the TV show) Cops. It was pretty smooth. We are talking about crayfish here, after all, not cocaine.” Prosecutors allege that Spaulding was selling the crayfish via the internet at prices from $17 for two juveniles to $52 for a group of 40 crayfish to people who kept them in aquariums as pets or, due to their prodigious ability to clone themselves, as a reliable, self-perpetuating food source for other kept animals. The species has spread across waterways in Europe as people have dumped them into rivers, lakes and toilets. Their tiny eggs can also inadvertently get washed down drains when emptying aquarium tanks, which Nethero said could be a pathway for the species to establish themselves in the US. The marbled crayfish, also known as marmokrebs, self-cloning, or virgin crayfish, is at first glance relatively unremarkable – measuring around five inches in length, sporting a reddish or blue mottled shell and surviving off an omnivorous diet of algae, plants and amphibians. But the species is parthenogenetic, meaning that it can asexually reproduce itself. All known marbled crayfish are female – no males have been discovered – and each animal can lay up to 700 unfertilized eggs that develop into genetically identical offspring. This prodigious cloning ability allows the marbled crayfish to quickly dominate any aquatic ecosystem it finds itself in, outcompeting, or consuming, any native species already there. Experts have compared the spread of the species to the way that cancer develops in the body. “This crayfish is a serious pest,” said Gerhard Scholtz, an evolutionary biologist at Humboldt University in Berlin. The origin of the crayfish is murky – it was first recognized at a pet fair in Germany in 1995 before escaping into the wild – but it is now banned from being kept or distributed within the European Union and several other places, such as Japan. No such ban yet exists in the US, a country that is already grappling with the environmental impact of a raft of introduced species that have upended landscapes, from feral hogs to Asian carp.",News/Environment,Ohio woman pleads guilty to selling invasive crayfish species across 36 states ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/12/ohio-woman-marbled-crayfish-invasive-species
5/12/2022,"Female candidates are being overlooked to run in safe seats by both major parties, with new analysis showing just two in 10 female candidates have been put forward for winnable seats at this year’s election, while safe seats are “saved for the boys”. Research from the Australian National University’s Global Institute for Women’s Leadership shows that just 20% of female candidates running for the Coalition are contesting safe seats, compared with the 46% of men who are set to be elected. For the Labor party, the numbers are slightly better, with 24% of the party’s female candidates contesting safe seats compared with 33% of male candidates. The analysis considers an unwinnable seat to be one that is deemed by the Australian Electoral Commission to have a “safe” or “fairly safe” margin for the opposing party, meaning seats with a margin above 6%. The analysis has focused only on seats where the key contest is between the major parties, examining candidates in 137 of the 151 seats in the House of Representatives, but also including incumbent MPs. Prof Michelle Ryan, the director of the global institute for women’s leadership, said the research highlighted the “glass cliff” phenomenon where women were offered positions with more uncertainty, often in circumstances where men were not interested. The term was first coined for the corporate sector to describe when women were put on boards of directors at times of crises or when a company’s share price had dropped. “The idea underlying all of these is that women get put forward for leadership positions that are risky and precarious,” she told Guardian Australia. “So in this case with political candidates, it is because their seats are unwinnable; or if they do win the seats, then they’re in this precarious, marginal sort of state [and] they have got to spend their whole time campaigning right up until the next election. “It’s a poisoned chalice, it looks good from the outset but is not particularly great” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning For Labor, 76% of its female candidates are what Ryan terms “glass cliff candidates”, running in seats they are unlikely to win or that are precarious to hold. The equivalent proportion of men running in these seats is 67%. For the Coalition, 80% of female candidates are in this category, compared with the equivalent proportion of men running in these seats at 54%. She said that while it was difficult to judge each party’s internal preselection processes, safe seats appeared to be overwhelmingly reserved for men by both major parties. “If you’ve got a nice, safe seat, you often see people being parachuted into that seat, and it’s often someone that’s part of the old boys club; so you save the safe seats for the boys,” Ryan said. “You could say that just happens to leave the other seats for women – and I’m being slightly charitable there – but the flip side is saying look, ‘that’s a dog of a seat, who wants that? No one wants that, and you protect your guys from those sorts of things.” “And if you want to be really uncharitable you say ‘oh look, they’re making us put some women in and we’ll look bad if we don’t have enough women in there, so let’s put her in that, as a bit of a sacrificial lamb’.” In the 2022 federal election, 43% of Labor candidates and 29% of Coalition candidates are female. Labor has preselected a total of 62 female candidates, compared with the 41 preselected by the Liberal and National parties. In the 46th parliament, females accounted for 41% of the MPs on Labor’s team in the lower house, compared with just 20% of Coalition MPs. Across both parties, at least six incumbent female MPs are being challenged by male candidates in marginal seats, while seven sitting male MPs are being challenged by female candidates. Sitting female Labor MPs in Lilley, Cowan and Gilmore are being challenged by Liberal men, while Labor male candidates are attempting to topple sitting Liberal women in Bass, Robertson and Lindsay. Ryan said that the research also highlighted the challenge facing women of culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, who were even less likely to be preselected for safe seats. “For those minority of women that are in the safe seats, it tends to be white women, so women from ethnic and linguistically diverse backgrounds seem to be overrepresented in those glass cliff positions,” she said. Ryan said preselecting more women for safe and winnable seats was the best way to achieve gender equity in politics and to ensure parliament represented the diversity of the community, and said misogyny and sexism appeared to be underlying the failure to shift the dial. “When we’re trying to achieve gender equality sometimes we just look at really bare-bones basics – we need more women, let’s put more women candidates in. “But there’s not a deeper, more thought-out analysis of: how are we actually going to get them in those positions?” she said. “I think it’s a lack of a real, genuine engagement about what really needs to be done to effect change.”",News/Politics,"‘Glass cliff’: only two in 10 female Coalition and Labor candidates in winnable seats, analysis finds",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/12/glass-cliff-only-two-in-10-female-coalition-and-labor-candidates-in-winnable-seats-analysis-finds
5/12/2022,"For anyone who’s ever bemoaned the parochialism of contemporary literary fiction – its preponderance of writer protagonists, thinking and doing the things that writers think and do – here is a corrective: a novel about the mechanised harvesting of peat in 1950s Ireland, told from the perspective of a mathematician. Its eponymous narrator is a Russian emigre hired by Bord na Móna, an Irish state-owned company based in Kildare, to help measure swathes of land set for drainage. After weeks spent tracing vast triangles across bogs, swamps and pastures, he receives an ominous letter summoning him back to the USSR; unnerved, he decamps to a small island on the Shannon estuary in order to lie low. The Geometer Lobachevsky is light on plot but heavy on ambience. Adrian Duncan’s narrator registers a succession of sensory impressions with the bland officiousness of a surveyor’s report: the lowing of cows and lapping of waves; the comings and goings of gannets and gulls; downpours of varying intensity; sunlight glistening on jars of marmalade; “the quiet but busy rumble of carts, cars and tractors”. The narrative voice is almost compelling in its studied dullness. A typical sentence reads: “I walk towards the tripod to see, with the evening sun breaking through a row of poplars edging the field, what the visibility through the theodolite is like.” This monotone is intermittently thrown into relief by the lively, colloquial dialogue of various Irish characters. Lobachevsky’s attempts to suss out his hosts and their culture (“I am not always quite sure when these men are joking”) form the novel’s psychological core. His boss, Rhatigan, is a brooding figure who has channelled his repressed guilt about his violent past into an obsessive work ethic. Lobachevsky scrutinises people as if they were maths problems: he speculates of Rhatigan’s underling, Colm, that “all that seems harmless in him is the precise obverse of what is pernicious … if these two facets were the opposing faces of a larger complicated form like a dodecahedron, then what might the other opposing facets of this form comprise?… what might one learn as to the nature of the entity?” Duncan worked as a structural engineer for many years before becoming a visual artist and then an author. Though his interest in getting inside the heads of logicians and engineers is by no means unique – Will Eaves’s fictionalisation of Alan Turing in Murmur (2018) and Adam Mars-Jones’s portrayal of a military contractor in Batlava Lake (2021) spring to mind – he’s relatively unusual in having built an entire small oeuvre around such figures: his previous novel, A Sabbatical in Leipzig, centres on the reminisces of a retired bridge engineer; his 2019 debut, Love Notes from a German Building Site, does pretty much what it says on the tin. The Geometer Lobachevsky features some pleasing descriptions. An old barfly’s “hindquarters protrude in a way that thrusts the top half of his body forward as if he smells the world first before he sees it”; outcrops of lichens on a cliffside “appear as adamant citadels”; elsewhere we encounter a “corduroy of gnarled planks”. The rendering of Irish names in Russified spelling early in the novel, presumably because the narrator doesn’t yet know any better, is a neat touch – Colm is “Kolim”, Connolly is “Konolii”, and so on. Broad overarching themes – the idea of infrastructure as a building block of nationhood; the loneliness of exile – are subtly teased out of the assorted minutiae of topsoil, spirit levels and ordnance. On the downside, it drags a bit. If the narrator’s lugubrious laconicism rings true to the diminished experience of a life in limbo, the novel’s pervasive sense of inertia is no less frustrating for being deliberate. You can do great things with negative space in the visual arts, but the novel form is in certain respects stubbornly conservative: it cannot do without narrative thrust. Duncan’s protagonist stumbles upon the nub of the problem during one of his ruminations: “I’ve come to realise that geometric visualisations without their mirroring algebra fail in the realm of application.” Indeed, what we have here is not so much a story as a tableau. Artfully arranged, for sure, and intriguing up to a point – but not enough.  The Geometer Lobachevsky by Adrian Duncan is published by Tuskar Rock (£14.99).

5/12/2022,"We spotted the beach at Èze-sur-Mer on the train back to Nice after a hot sweaty day trip to Monaco – we couldn’t resist jumping off the train and heading down for a dip in the clear water we saw. A long wide bay, framed by mountains felt a million miles away from the crowded beaches in Nice – and as an added bonus for anyone who has almost broken their ankles on the rocks at Nice, this beach is of small smooth pebbles. A small slice of paradise on the busiest section of the Côte d’Azur.Jake A The island of Noirmoutier, off the Vendée coast, is a cyclist’s and beach-lover’s paradise. The Noirmoutier Bridge is toll-free, spectacular and has a bike lane. Time your journey right and you can also cross via the beautiful Passage du Gois causeway. Once on the island there is a variety of beaches to choose from. Our favourite is the seven-kilometre-long Barbȃtre beach. It has a long stretch of fine golden sand, backed by pine forests, and you can find solitude and relaxation, or take part in activities including sand-yachting and windsurfing. The nearby nature reserve, Sébastopol Polder, offers great birdwatching.ile-noirmoutier.comKevin With a modest hipster, surfer presence but retaining the quaint qualities of the French coast, Contis-Plage, in the Landes department about 110km south of Bordeaux, is simply a great beach. With a large but rather upmarket camping, a relatively swanky hotel and lots of rentals, Contis caters to all. As well as surf and two superb beaches (the main one and the slightly more remote Contis Sud) it offers a calm river for paddleboarding and a pine forest to cycle in..cotelandesnaturetourisme.co.ukVictoria Tucked away in the sheltered bays between Marseille and Cassis are Les Calanques (defined as narrow steep sided coves) and my favourite beach: Calanque d’en Vau. The hour hike from Cassis along cliff tops on pine-perfumed paths offers a heavenly reward – a descent down steps cut into limestone cliffs to a celestial cove of pebbles and sand and clear turquoise waters. It’s like being enticed through the gates of heaven. Take plenty of water and a good book and sink into the sand for the rest of the day, enjoying the views of the jagged cliffs, the lush vegetation and the air.Yasmin East of Toulon is Île de Porquerolles, largest of the Îles d’Hyères. A remote stretch of sand separates the untamed trees from the glittering sea – Plage Notre-Dame. Stepping off the €24 ferry from Hyères the only way to reach the beach is on foot or by bicycle; there are no cars allowed on the island. This makes for a peaceful journey through a pine forest, easily traversed in trainers or flip-flops. As you approach the beach from the cliffs above there is a breathtaking view of the unspoiled sand. It’s also a very safe beach – shallow water caused by a sandbank means you can walk out to sea for about 300 metres.hyeres-tourism.co.ukAlexandra Richards Imagine St Ives but on the stunning Côte de Vermeille, on the Med near the border with Spain. Galleries, cafes and restaurants line car-free shady alleys. Collioure wraps itself around the perfect arc of the bay and brightly coloured houses hang on hillsides. You can wander in the footsteps of Matisse and Derain, who invented fauvism here. Take a coffee in one of the portside cafes and then feel the warm sand between your toes and paddle on one of the four beaches. But if the bustle is too much, my secret tip is a 30-minute hike north-east over the cliffs to sand-and-pebble Plage de l’Ouille. No roads come to this enchanted spot.Simon  Guardian Travel readers' tips Every week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels. A selection of tips will be featured online and may appear in print. To enter the latest competition visit the readers' tips homepage - There are countless fabulous near-deserted beaches all over Brittany but our family’s favourite is the beautiful Plage du Kelenn in Carantec. It has everything youngsters could possibly need. Golden sand but with a scattering of rock pools, a bit of surf but not too rough and a cracking diving board. For the grownups I can heartily recommend the oysters and Breton cider at the friendly Paradiso Plage restaurant.Matt Croxall I found the idyllic beach of my dreams at Prieuré, just south of Dinard on the Côte d’Émeraude. It’s easy to get to: just catch a ferry to Saint-Malo from Portsmouth then cross the Rance estuary by ferry in 20 minutes, or drive round (also 20 minutes). Plage du Prieuré is a super sandy crescent with a gently sloping shore, a flowery promenade, rock pools to the west, foodie delights to the east, and even beachcombing treasures.Kate Harris When the great French film director Jacques Tati was looking for the perfect beach setting for the adventures of his endearing clown, Monsieur Hulot, he was thrilled to find Saint-Marc-sur-Mer. On Brittany’s Atlantic Coast and easy to get to from Nantes, the beach itself is the star. Not a lot has changed since 1951. We stayed in the hotel that served as the film’s backdrop, walked along the accessible clifftops to adjoining beaches suitable for solo travellers, families and even nudists, and paused for selfies with the lifesize statue of Hulot, still casting a quizzical eye over this magical spot.Robert Massey A family favourite beach in Normandy is Plage de Carolles, in the bay of Mont Saint-Michel near Granville (which provides an excellent back-up in wet weather). With excellent sandy stretches and rock pools overlooked by cliffs and the occasional hang glider, we’ve spent many happy days on holiday here searching for cockles, mussels and other shellfish before eating moules-frites at its cafes or picnicking with fresh baguettes and salad before driving back to a cottage in the beautiful Normandy countryside, sun-baked and sandy.Alice",Lifestyle/Travel,‘Enticed through the gates of heaven’: readers’ best French beaches,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/may/12/best-french-beaches-france-holiday-by-readers
5/12/2022,"Trevor Strnad, the lead vocalist and co-founder of the US black-metal band the Black Dahlia Murder, has died aged 41. His bandmates confirmed his death on social media. No cause was given, but contact information for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline was shared alongside the announcement. “It is with deep sadness that we announce the passing of Trevor Scott Strnad,” the Michigan group said in a statement. “Beloved son, brother, and [shepherd] of good times, he was loved by all that met him. A walking encyclopedia of all things music. He was a hugger, a writer, and truly one of the world’s greatest entertainers. His lyrics provided the world with stories and spells and horror and whimsy. It was his life to be your show.” The band’s lead guitarist, Brandon Ellis, called him “one of the funniest and most entertaining people to walk the earth. The life of the party that is the Black Dahlia Murder, as well as any given room he happens to occupy. A lyrical mastermind. A champion of the entire culture of heavy music. Also my biggest supporter.” The wider metal world also paid tribute to Strnad. Matt Heafy of Trivium called him an “icon of modern metal”. “He was such a sweet guy,” said Robb Flynn of Machine Head. “Had him on my podcast about 10 months ago, he was very open about struggling with depression. It’s a sad day for the metal community.” The Black Dahlia Murder formed in 2000, naming themselves after the 1947 unsolved murder of aspiring actor Elizabeth Short and citing acts such as Metallica, Pantera and Judas Priest as influences. After they released several EPs independently, they signed to Metal Blade Records in 2003, which became their long-term home. Their most recent release for the label was 2020’s Verminous. The title referred to metal fans being the carriers of a cultural plague. Strnad and rhythm guitarist Brian Eschbach were the only constant members of the group, which had a fluctuating lineup. Their highest-charting album was 2011’s Ritual, which reached No 31 in the US Billboard album chart. Strnad came to heavy metal as a child obsessed with horror films and fantasy. “I used to cruise the metal aisle and look at all the artwork at the record stores back in the day,” he told Echoes and Dust in 2020. “Once I really figured out that there was music about dragons, skeletons and shit like that, it felt perfect for me. Once I had opened that book, there was no stopping me.” He described horror and metal as “healthy outlets for negative energy”, though admitted that being the lone metal fan in his teenage community could be isolating. “I feel like the average person doesn’t see the merit in our culture and our world and doesn’t see how passionate we are, how it gives us so much life. It’s definitely been instrumental in shaping who I am.” In a 2021 interview with Metal Injection, Strnad was open about the toll of drinking on tour as a way of maintaining the persona fans expected of him, and of the aesthetic pressures he felt as the band’s frontman. “It’s accumulated in some self-doubt, in more anxiety for me as the band has gotten bigger and bigger, and there’s more eyes and more pressure,” he said. “I want my 40s to be awesome,” he said, expressing his desire for the Black Dahlia Murder to last another 20 years and for him to “segue into being an older metalhead gracefully”. Strnad said that being left alone with his thoughts during two years of the pandemic had been “so dangerous” for him, and that he was exploring psychedelic and ketamine therapy as a way of breaking out of old self-defeating thought patterns and helping him push past a creative blockage. Talking about his mental health publicly had helped him, he said. “And I figure it might be helping somebody else to know that I’m a human being and that someone that maybe they look up to for inspiration goes through it too.” In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 and the domestic abuse helpline is 0808 2000 247.

5/12/2022,"There’s a bit in episode two of The Essex Serpent on Apple TV+ – I am one of the few people on Earth who will ever make it to episode two, so I can tell you this safe in the knowledge that you will never bother to watch as far – where Claire Danes’s Cora and Tom Hiddleston’s Will experience fata morgana, a mirage out at sea. The central struggle at the heart of The Essex Serpent – or one of the 12 or 14 scattergun themes it has – is Cora’s naturalist, reason-based logic versus preacher Will’s more measured, conservative, faith-based beliefs, and how they weirdly flirt with each other by reading intensely through library books and tiptoeing around whether God is real. The mirage itches that scratch for them both: she has something she can research all the magic out of; he has something he can remember reading about romantically in one of his leather-bound books. They’ll bond over this, eventually, but I won’t watch that far. No one will. There’s an analogy in here, and I am getting round to it: good TV is a random accomplishment that demands magic as much as it demands the exact right atmospheric conditions. It makes no sense that good TV ever really exists. Everyone involved – the costume designers, the lighting people, the sound recordists, the set scouts – have to get their job exactly right to produce one convincing scene as part of a far wider whole. It requires child actors who can actually act. There are so many whirring parts to make even one frame of legacy television. And as The Essex Serpent proves, even if you get a lot right, it can still be wrong. Let’s start with the good bits: it is satisfyingly moody – lots of beautiful high shots of flat marshes, fog and, hark, there! Movement in the water! Also, it’s excellently cast: Claire Danes is, as ever, amazing; Frank Dillane is especially good as a slimy, wry, cocky rewritten version of the book’s Dr Garrett; Hayley Squires brings a huge amount of life to what could very easily be a useless side-character who just says “Yes, m’lady” a lot; Tom Hiddleston, as ever, puts in a perfect shift as Tom Hiddleston, where his performance really always relies on whether you can look past the fact that Tom Hiddleston is doing it, which I personally cannot. It looks beautiful. It feels “of a time” in exactly the way the source material demands: Victorian Essex on the verge of an era when old English villages that ran on folklore and hysteria started to cede to the big city sprawl. But there is something missing at the heart of this one – that 1% of magic that every good TV show demands – and its lack makes this programme a great, long slog. It’s hard to put your finger exactly on what’s wrong: one thing is that the central fear the village is experiencing, the ancient horror of the mythological Essex Serpent, is never really set up enough for you to get why everyone’s hysterical. Maybe it’s because Hiddleston and Danes’s theological squabbling, the dynamite that explodes the entire story, feels less like two intellectual titans locking horns and more like a nervous University Challenge team trying to diplomatically figure out what order they’ll sit in. Maybe it’s too obsessed with being legacy TV to actually be good legacy TV: everyone’s always giving each other very poignant weird gifts, or gazing at one thing while crying about another, or heroically saving a life. And some of the dialogue – Claire Danes wakes up from a traumatic nightmare to be hugged instantly by a maid, who instantly says: “It’s OK. Michael can’t hurt you any more” – I mean, come on. Subtlety exists, Apple! I am begging you to use it! Listen, I get it. It’s hard to keep making these big-budget limited series where absolute A-list actors agree to come down from film to TV. Every actor wants their Mare of Easttown moment, and every channel and streaming platform wants to give it to them. You buy the rights to the bestselling books and you cast the big-face actors and you get a talented director and you throw millions of pounds at it and you hope that’s enough. But, as The Essex Serpent proves, you still need something else: God, magic, luck, science. Whatever it is, this doesn’t have it.",Arts/Television & radio,The Essex Serpent: such a slog surely no one will make it past episode one,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/12/the-essex-serpent-claire-danes-tom-hiddleston-such-a-slog-surely-no-one-will-make-it-past-episode-one
5/12/2022,"Finland must apply to join Nato without delay in the wake of Russia’s attack on Ukraine, its president and prime minister have said, confirming a historic change in the Nordic country’s security policy after decades of military non-alignment. Sauli Niinistö and Sanna Marin made the call in a joint statement, adding: “We hope that the national steps still needed to make this decision will be taken rapidly within the next few days.” Nato membership would strengthen Finland’s security, the two leaders said, and as a member of Nato: “Finland would strengthen the entire defence alliance. Finland must apply for Nato membership as a matter of urgency.” Finland shares an 810-mile (1,300km) border with Russia and has long viewed joining the US-led alliance as an unnecessary provocation of Moscow, but Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February has led to a profound shift in its thinking. Public support for Nato membership has trebled in Finland, with the latest poll by the public broadcaster Yle showing 76% of Finns in favour compared with about 25% before the invasion, with only 12% against. The president, prime minister and senior cabinet ministers will meet on Sunday to make the formal decision on submitting the country’s membership application. A positive decision would then be presented to parliament for approval early next week. Neighbouring Sweden is thought likely to follow suit, with its ruling Social Democrats due to decide on Sunday whether to overturn their longstanding opposition to Nato membership, paving the way for an application to join the 30-nation alliance. Sweden’s foreign minister, Ann Linde, said Niinistö and Marin’s statement was “an important message”, adding that Finland was “Sweden’s closest security and defence partner” and its assessments “must be taken into account”. Sweden’s Expressen daily, citing unnamed sources, said Stockholm’s decision would be made on Monday, with a formal application for membership to be submitted immediately afterwards. Nordic media have previously said the two countries were likely to submit a joint application. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said last month Finland and Sweden would be welcomed “with open arms” and it should be possible to allow the two to join “quite quickly”, although the process of formal ratification by all the alliance’s members could take several months. Russia has repeatedly warned Finland and Sweden against joining Nato, saying the “serious military and political consequences” of such a move would oblige it to “restore military balance” by strengthening its defences in the Baltic Sea region, including by deploying nuclear weapons. Dmitry Medvedev, the former Russian president and long-time ally of Vladimir Putin, said on Thursday that western countries’ “proxy war with Russia” would “increase the likelihood of a direct and open conflict between Nato and Russia”. Urging the west not to “lie to yourself and others” and “choke in the paroxysms of Russophobia”, Medvedev said such a conflict “always has the risk of turning into a full-fledged nuclear war” and that this would be “catastrophic for everyone”. Other governments in the region welcomed Helsinki’s statement. Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said Finnish membership would “strengthen Nato and our common security”. Copenhagen would do everything for a quick admission process, she said. Estonia’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, said her country supported Finland’s rapid accession. “History being made by our northern neighbours,” she tweeted. “You can count on our full support. We support a rapid accession process. From our side will make necessary steps quickly.” Finland’s foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, told the European parliament on Thursday that accession to Nato would strengthen security in the region. Norway, Denmark and the three Baltic states are already Nato members and the addition of Finland would “bring added value”, he said. Finland and Sweden are officially non-aligned but became Nato partners – taking part in exercises and exchanging intelligence – after abandoning their strict neutrality when they joined the EU in 1995 after the end of the cold war. Finland declared independence in 1917 after more than a century of Russian rule, and its heavily outnumbered army twice fought off Soviet forces during the second world war before ceding some border territory. Sweden has not fought a war for 200 years. Marin and her Swedish counterpart, Magdalena Andersson, said at a joint press conference last month that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had changed Europe’s whole security landscape and “dramatically shaped mindsets” in the Nordic countries. Nato’s common security guarantee rests on article 5, the alliance’s cornerstone, which says an attack on one Nato member is an attack on all. It has only been invoked once in the organisation’s history, in response to the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks.",News/World news,"Finland must apply to join Nato without delay, say president and PM",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/12/finland-apply-join-nato-without-delay-president-pm
5/12/2022,"Sky News presenter Paul Murray unleashed a foul-mouthed tirade against Labor off air, calling the opposition leader “fucking Albo”, and directing his audience to vote for the Coalition. An audio recording from the Eatons Hill Hotel in Brisbane on Tuesday night has the Sky After Dark host making offensive remarks about senior Labor figures and demeaning comments about trans people, while defence minister, Peter Dutton, waited to be interviewed. It is not known if Dutton heard the remarks and he has been contacted for comment. Murray was warming-up the audience ahead of Sky’s Paul Murray’s Live Pub Test, imploring them to vote for the Liberal and National candidates, rather than minor parties, to ensure a Coalition election victory. During the 10-minute monologue Murray mocked former treasurer Wayne Swan, the president of the ALP, Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, West Australian premier Mark McGowan and Sky News commentator and regular guest Nicholas Reece, deputy lord mayor of Melbourne city council. Murray laughed at Swan for coming to the defence of Albanese, when he accused the media of “disgusting” gotcha journalism. “And again, what about Wayne Swan the other day, screaming and moaning because of course ‘the press has been mean to Albo, too mean to Albo’”, Murray said. He called the opposition leader “fucking Albo” when relating a story about two Labor leaders Albanese and McGowan owning poodles; and he said shadow foreign affairs spokesperson Penny Wong looked like a “mean girl”. “Have you heard about how Mark McGowan has a poodle like fucking Albo?,” he said. “We got mean girl Penny Wong pretending to be nice but still looking like a mean girl. “We got Albo promising to own 40% of people’s houses. How good is that idea? Albo Bank? Fair dinkum.” He appealed to the crowd to ensure everyone votes LNP, because it is “your job” and “our job” to “build a buffer against the woke in Victoria”. “We’re going to build a buffer against the teals in Sydney,” he said. “We’re going to build a buffer against the bullshit that might be playing in places like Western Australia”. Murray also talked about transgender people and appeared to ridicule trans swimmer Lia Thomas, who made history as the first known transgender athlete to win a US college swimming championship. “A sheila with a penis swam faster than a bunch of women without a penis; who has a girlfriend with a vagina; but he is a lesbian,” Murray said. “Welcome to 2022 people, welcome to 2022. That’s their game and that’s the way that they play.” About Palaszczuk and her Labor team, he says: “Honestly, as I said before the election and I repeat now, flush … them, Domestos [bleach] and flush again, when it comes to that mob.” Murray asks the audience to yell out which regular guests they like and which they don’t. They say they like Bronwyn Bishop, Mark Latham and Matt Canavan but they don’t like regular Labor guests Nicholas Reece, and Stephen Conroy. Murray laughs and says Reece is like a “blow-up clown doll”, meaning he gets knocked down and always comes back for more, adding “he thinks he’s doing god’s work”. He calls on the audience to vote to ensure Labor doesn’t win because his television show, and Sky News in general and “views like yours” will be in danger. “What do you think’s gonna happen to a show like mine and a station like ours and views like yours if they end up in charge?,” Murray says. “That’s why it matters. It’s not just any old election. We all know that it has serious consequences, but I genuinely believe that the right thing can happen. I believe that it’s just the same as 2019. There’s a whole bunch of people who, frankly, tell pollsters to bugger off, In fact did you know this? Murray believes the Coalition can still win because polls are inaccurate. “Now you know and I know what the stakes are and why China matters. What China means.” “You’ve heard me talk about the preferences and obviously this election. There are some people who voted for the LNP in 2019 last time who say they don’t want to do it this time. But preferences matter.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He warns that people who say they are annoyed with the LNP and they are going to “put them all last” will end up with an Albanese government if they “muck around with the lower house”. “So if you’ve got one of those mates, in my view, my editorial, they say ‘I’ll put them all last,’ they’re gonna get Albo. “That’s how it works. You’re not going to get the Palmer party as the government; not going to get One Nation as the government.” “But mucking around in the lower house is gonna result with Albo as prime minister,” he said. In his interview after the monologue, Dutton also encouraged “the silent majority” who support the Liberal party to speak up. “The trouble is for our support base … they’re out working, and of a night-time, they’re doing the books and putting kids to bed and dealing with the realities of life,” Dutton said. “They’re not involved in the day-to-day political exchange that you might see on Twitter or Facebook. “They just don’t have the time to be online warriors the way that the left does.” Murray promised the crowd they can take selfies with him at the end of the show.

5/12/2022,"When the incredible but short-lived iPod Mini was released in 2004, it wasn’t available in the UK at first. I had to ask friends in Florida to bring one over for my son’s 12th birthday. He loved showing his friends this device that looked like it belonged in the future. Our family has had plenty of iPods over the years; an early iPod with a click wheel, a mini, three Nanos, two Shuffles, and a Classic. My wife still takes her 2007 “fat iPod nano” on holiday as she doesn’t like taking her iPhone to the pool. As a music player, an iPod has none of the potential distractions of a phone. No emails, no messages, and no notifications. It’s a shame there will be no more iPods as there’s still a place for a distraction-free music player. My 2007 black iPhone Classic is still permanently attached to the hi-fi in my car. It’s a 160Gb model and contains my entire music collection – ripped from CDs – as it was a few years ago. The battery doesn’t last, but that doesn’t matter as it’s constantly connected to USB power in my car. Andy Clarke, software designer, Wales, UK I bought my first iPod in 2004 in Singapore. It was a 40GB iPod and came with so many accessories – a docking port charger, headphones, a protective carry case, you name it. I had all my music digitised and on my iPod – it was so easy back then. The wheel on the original iPods used to drive me a bit crazy as it was sensitive to the slightest touch; you’d try to move forwards on a playlist and you’d skip too many songs, so you’d try to go back but would go too far the other way. I still have my first iPod, and it still worked the last time I tried it. The biggest problem I have is finding a charger as Apple have changed them so many times. Sadly, I got rid of my docking port – more fool me. But I won’t get rid of the iPod as it works and a museum might want it one day. I still use my iPod Shuffle – it’s so much easier at the gym than a phone. I use my phone everywhere else, but I’ve found quite a lot of what I listen to is not available on Spotify. I’m sorry to see the iPod go simply because I can’t afford what Apple charge for an iPhone with memory large enough to get all of my music and playlists on to. Elizabeth Dennett, 58, New Zealand The iPod arrived in that teenage sweet spot where music is everything. In the same way people venerate vinyl now, this was my format. I’d load up on CDs at Selectadisc in Nottingham, rip them to iTunes, shelve them and mooch off into college or town with the latest stuff blasting out. It’s the device on which I formed memories with Radiohead, Wilco, REM, Bloc Party, Blur, Interpol, Franz Ferdinand, Beck, Gorillaz and loads of other bands that now seem really ancient. Shuffle was there for the quick five-minute blast between lessons or work shifts where you just needed to fill your brain with music, but I was almost always a snob about listening to albums from back to front. And always dreamed of someone picking up my iPod and commenting on how great my music taste was and asking me to marry them. Times change and it’s a miracle to have essentially every song streamable in my pocket, with wireless headphones. But I’m also an old git now with responsibilities – and I miss the iPod days. Nothing will quite touch that feeling of powering around town filling my brain with endless new music on a distraction-free, dedicated, insanely cool, easy-to-use piece of overpriced tech that wasn’t also a portal to social media hell. Matt, 33, reporter, Nottingham, UK In the second week of January 2005 my father took me to John Lewis in Reading for the sole purpose of trying to find the elusive fourth generation 40 GB model. It had sold out everywhere before Christmas and I was desperate to finally get my first ever iPod. I’d been using a CD Walkman for years, but the iPod was tiny (for the time), sleek, intuitive to use, and looked like one of those futuristic devices from a 50s sci-fi comic. It went everywhere with me – carrying songs ripped from all my parents’ CDs; Queen, Erik Satie, Bob Dylan, Weezer, the Rocky soundtrack, and eventually thousands of other tracks ripped from friends’ computers using a rather cheeky piece of free software called MyTunes Redux. The following year, it got crushed in a bike accident, but I woke up in hospital with it still playing next to me, screen cracked and the body split down the seam – my first taste of heartbreak. Seventeen years later, I still can’t bring myself to throw the old 40GB away, so I use it to store camera memory cards in the cable drawer. I’m surprisingly heavy-hearted about it, and probably feel very similar to how people felt when the original Game Boy was discontinued in 2003, which marked the end of an era for iconic gaming devices. When the news broke about Apple dropping it, I admit, I went straight to the site and ordered a new Touch to keep in the cable drawer as back-up for when my ageing iPod Video finally calls it a day. I’m just not ready to switch systems. Alexander Lerche, 34, photojournalist, Doha, Qatar I first saw an iPod in a client’s office in 2002. I was totally smitten. My wife bought me my first iPod (20GB) for Christmas that year. It took me an entire weekend to upload all my CDs into iTunes to transfer to the iPod. Having lugged about cases of LPs as a teenager, I couldn’t believe I had all my music in my pocket, available to play at will. I remember the thrill of opening the box – beautiful, smooth cardboard with the strap line “Designed in California”. And then the gorgeous white iPod, which felt so good in the palm of my hand. I also remember paying a small fortune to have a car kit installed so I could play anything from my music collection while driving. When I first took my iPod to the beach, I enclosed it in a waterproof, shockproof case – I was paranoid about not damaging it in any way. The iPod was a real breakthrough, and thanks to technology I can now listen to anything at anytime via my iPhone or MacBook. I no longer use mine now – the battery can’t be charged. But I will always keep my original iPod. Nigel Wilson, 66, yoga teacher, Kent, UK My dad went to the States in 2004 and came back with a third generation iPod for my brother and I was outraged. He wasn’t ever kind enough to lend it to me, but instead I would steal his spare set of headphones and just put the plug end into my pocket so I would look cool going to school. I had a friend around that same time and she had an iPod Shuffle which she was kind enough to lend, and I recall her love for Eminem. Even to this day, when I hear Eminem the memories of that Shuffle come back. When I eventually got my own third gen in 2006 I started to really find my own music taste for the first time. I used to spend hours uploading music from CDs and making sure every song had all the info perfectly recorded so I could handpick each one and put it cleanly into its appropriate playlist. I made lifelong friends in those early days as we swapped music and bonded over certain songs or artists. I still have all the music I ever loaded on to it on a special hard drive at home. My first album was Aladdin, the soundtrack.

5/12/2022,"The prisons minister has ordered an immediate review into the serial killer Levi Bellfield’s request to get married in prison, describing the proposal as “absolutely appalling”. Bellfield, who murdered Marsha McDonnell, Amelie Delagrange and Milly Dowler, is engaged and has requested a prison wedding, the Ministry of Justice has confirmed. It is understood that Bellfield’s application is being processed and he would need the permission of the prison governor to marry at HMP Frankland in Durham. Speaking to Sky News, the prisons minister, Victoria Atkins, said the news called into question the workings of the Human Rights Act, saying Bellfield had a right under article 12 to have his application for a wedding considered. When asked about the request, Atkins said: “I just want to reassure people, I understand an application has been made that has not been decided yet, and he most certainly has not yet married, but, if I may, he’s currently got the right under article 12 of the Human Rights Act to get married … or they have the right to have the application to be considered by prison governors. “I very much welcome the debate we’re about to have about the bill of rights and looking at human rights for the United Kingdom for the 21st century. Believe me, I’ll be raising this.” News of the story, which first appeared in the Sun, said Bellfield proposed to his fiancee in front of prison staff. Speaking to the newspaper, the former justice secretary Robert Buckland said: “Milly never got to see her wedding day. It cannot be right that he gets to have his. People will be rightly shocked to hear that a man capable of such depraved crimes and is rightly imprisoned is able to form a relationship of this kind.” Bellfield was given a whole-life term for murdering McDonnell, 19, in 2003, and for murdering Delagrange, 22, and attempting to murder Kate Sheedy, 18, in 2004. He was already serving this sentence when he went on trial for killing Milly, who was abducted while walking from school to her home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in March 2002. Bellfield was found guilty of abducting and killing the 13-year-old after a trial at the Old Bailey in 2011.",News/Society,Levi Bellfield: prisons minister to review serial killer’s ‘appalling’ request to marry,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/12/levi-bellfield-prisons-minister-review-serial-killer-request-marry-milly-dowler-marsha-mcdonnell-amelie-delagrange
5/12/2022,"When can you say that an organisation is a racist one? Is Beitar Jerusalem a racist club? While there’s a vast group of fans that are openly racist, the Israeli Premier League club tries, now and sporadically in the past, to fight them. “Here they come, the racist team of the country,” they sang for many years. But they’re a minority among Beitar fans. Were the English clubs racist entities during the 1980s when fans threw bananas at black players? Are they racist now because some fans abuse players online? Beitar, six-times national champions, isn’t a racist club but an organisation deeply infected with racism. Numerous owners and chairmen tried to fight the racists and paid a personal price. If Beitar could get rid of racism and racists they would do it but it’s getting harder and harder. It could have been done in the past more easily but now it looks like a herculean task. Most fans would love to have a normal club but they don’t call the shots. When Aviram Bruchian, Beitar’s captain in 2009 and nephew of club legend Uri Malmilian, said he would be happy to play alongside an Arab player, he was summoned to an urgent meeting with La Familia, the club’s far-right fan group. The next day he released the following message: “I am sorry for the pain that I’ve caused the fans and I do understand that I’ve hurt them. It is important for me that they will know that I’m with them in all circumstances. I’m not the one who takes such decisions but if the fans don’t want an Arab player, there will be no Arab player in Beitar.” When these kind of fans decide on club policy you have a serious problem. You just need to listen to their songs: Witnesses are the stars in the skyFor racism that is like a dreamThe whole world will testifyThere will be no Arabs in the team!I don’t care how many and how they will get killedEliminating Arabs makes me thrilledBoy, girl or oldWill bury every Arab deep in the ground It didn’t happen overnight. Beitar, who draw crowds of about 10,000, was formed as a club of a right-wing liberal movement and during the British Mandate years there was an alliance between the rejected of Beitar and Arab clubs. They never took a decision to become the home of choice for the rabid Arab-haters. That would be too simple. It’s a story of radicalisation by neglect, of opening the club up for political abuse, of turning a blind eye by the party and state. David Frenkiel was behind Beitar’s first website. He used to write about Beitar in the sports magazine Shem Hamisehak and says: “The anti-Arab wave started after the terror attacks in the second half of the 90s. The reaction from the media and the left led to a childish reaction. “The more the fans got attacked the more the provocations grow. I’m not sure all those who chanted were racists but that’s the way in the stand. You shout exactly the same chants as the guy next to you. People blamed the normative crowd for not standing up against the racists with a ridiculous claim. Who wants to confront those people? So after a while it became the flag that the fans were waving.” The growing presence of Arab clubs and players in the league made it easy to foul the air with such chants. It didn’t go unanswered. “Death to the Arabs” was replied to with “Death to the Jews”. And then Hapoel Tel Aviv fans joined in. Originally their image was anti the Maccabi Tel Aviv basketball club, the prudish, sanctimonious, smug, clean-faced club of aggressive Israeli nationalism. During their glory years in European competitions, Hapoel fans carried a banner saying: “We represent Hapoel, not Israel”. For Beitar they had a treat: Put Jerusalem in JordanGive it to the PalestiniansIn the 1967’s linesSplit it in twoGive it to the PalestiniansThere is no need for Teddy [Stadium, Beitar’s home]Nor for BeitarNot the Kotel [Western Wall] and the Knesset [Israeli parliament]Everything in this city is redundant Still, the media and rival fans didn’t create the racist problem, they just added some fuel. Beitar’s fan demographics are similar to many other teams’ but the problem developed among them for various reasons. The obvious one is that when you have Arab players in your team it ceases to be an issue. All major clubs had Arab-Israeli players and so avoided the problem. Bnei Yehuda had the same “no Arabs” disease but Eli Ohana stood his ground as a manager and relieved the club of this drawback. Beitar had many negotiations over the years with Arab-Israeli players but never managed to sign the deal. They must regret it now. And there was the encouragement from higher echelons. “I remember sitting in Teddy and telling [Jerusalem mayor and future prime minister] Ehud Olmert that what is happening on the East stand is not good and by shutting our mouths we give them legitimation,” said Ruvi Rivlin, former chairman of the club, minister and the president of Israel between 2014 and 2021, in the Forever Pure film. “‘You are the leaders of a community, of the government, say something. But they ignored it so they won’t make their supporters angry.” “We have made a mistake when we didn’t stop it at the time. We thought it was just nonsense that will disappear. We were wrong,” he said on a different occasion. In the late 1990s half the government sat in the VIP stand at Teddy masquerading as fans and ignored the chants. When Benjamin Netanyahu greeted the jubilant fans after the 1998 title in the city square, he didn’t mind the “Death to the Arabs” calls. He never did when it was addressed to PM Yitzhak Rabin, leaders of the left or to Arab citizens. He could only hear adulation. And there was worse. Itamar Ben Gvir, the young man who took the hood ornament from Rabin’s car, played at the club as a kid and grew to be an admirer of Baruch Goldstein, the Cave of the Patriarch murderer. He was an admirer of Rabbi Meir Kahane, the leader of the Jewish supremacy party and member of the Knesset between 1984 and 1988. Ben Gvir became a frequent visitor to Teddy. Kahane was the most extreme of the extreme right. He had proposals such as separated beaches for Jews and non-Jews, and a ban on any non-Jewish person taking a political role of power or being able to vote for the Knesset. He also said that non-Jews shouldn’t be allowed to live in Jerusalem. The yellow-and-black fist flag of Kahane was on display at Beitar matches, although the movement was made illegal after the 1994 massacre in Hebron. Leaders of the neo-Kahanists went on pilgrimages to Teddy and Sakhnin [an Arab club] during the loaded matches between the two teams. Teddy over the years became the place for Likud politicians to show themselves. No wonder La Familia felt they had their backs covered by the government.

As much as 224mm of rain fell in 24 hours in some areas, with more forecast overnight. Fourteen state schools had closed due to the flooding and more than 530 roads had been closed or were impacted. The Bureau of Meteorology warned of further heavy rainfall over the next 24 to 48 hours, before lowering in intensity and easing following the weekend. Emergency crews had been responding to calls for assistance across Queensland. One man spent Wednesday night clinging to a tree in flood waters near Bundaberg. The man, in his 60s, was driving when his car became swamped by rising waters. He managed to get out and cling to a tree before the car went under, and spent the night there before being spotted by farmers on Thursday morning. Suffering hypothermia, he was flown by an RACQ LifeFlight Rescue chopper to hospital, where he was in a stable condition. A camper was also found safe and well after chasing his dog near flood waters. Police said the 36-year-old man was reported missing from an Imbil campsite, south of Gympie, on Thursday morning. Another five people escaped flooded cars in Caboolture, north of Brisbane. Authorities urged residents near Cooby Creek to secure property and prepare to move to higher ground if the situation worsened, as Cooby Dam was spilling. Parts of Grantham in the Lockyer Valley, west of Brisbane, had been inundated and authorities warned residents that multiple roads would remain underwater on coming days. To the west, the Bureau of Meteorology was warning Roma, St George, Blackwater, Mitchell, Rolleston and Injune residents that severe thunderstorms could bring heavy rainfall and flash flooding in coming hours. Sunshine Coast Hinterland and Wide Bay-Burnett residents had been told to prepare for severe weather and possible flash flooding in the early hours of Friday. The forecaster said six-hour rainfalls of 160mm were possible as a low-pressure trough crossed the coast overnight and the weather deteriorated on Friday. “Locally intense rainfall which may lead to dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding is possible with thunderstorms during Friday afternoon,” the BoM said in an alert on Thursday. Major flooding was forecast for Laidley Creek and the Mary River at Gympie with moderate flood warnings for the Bremer, Lockyer and Brisbane rivers on Thursday and Friday. Flood waters claimed the life of a woman on Wednesday after a dual ute was swept away north of Mackay. Two passengers, a man and a woman, escaped the vehicle and were taken to hospital as a precautionary measure.

Heavy downpours and possible thunderstorms were forecast for the central, southern and south-east regions of Queensland on Thursday. “These could produce damaging wind gusts and also intense rainfall that could lead to life-threatening flash flooding,” meteorologist Christie Johnson said. “Moving into Friday, we see the focus move to the south-east and, after that, the system moves away to the east and conditions improve on the weekend.” Rainfall totals across the east of the state were generally between 50mm and 70mm, with areas between the Daintree and Mackay, the Sunshine Coast and central Queensland recording more than 100mm on Wednesday.",News/Australia news,Flooding rains expected to continue lashing Queensland,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/12/qld-flooding-weather-south-east-queensland-floods-storms-bom-bureau-meteorology-warning-heavy-rain
5/12/2022,"The New South Wales government has threatened to terminate its industrial agreement with the state’s powerful rail union after long-running negotiations over a new enterprise agreement broke down on Thursday. But the union has accused the state’s employee relations minister, Damien Tudehope, of attempting to “blow the whole thing up” after believing a deal had been reached on one of its key demands. On Thursday, Tudehope held a press conference with the state’s treasurer, Matt Kean, in which he said the government had “drawn a line in the sand”, after weeks of negotiations, over the Rail, Tram and Bus Union’s refusal to operate the new $2bn inner-city fleet. The trains, which have been in storage since they began arriving two years ago, are at the centre of the long-running standoff between the government and the union. The union says the trains are not safe to operate because guards cannot peer out of them to check that train platforms are clear. But the government has long dismissed that concern, saying the trains have been passed as safe to operate by regulators. “The NIF [New Intercity Fleet] are safe, world-class trains that will enormously improve the experience for commuters,” Tudehope said. “The refusal by union leadership to operate these trains is further evidence of their collusion with NSW Labor. The commuting public and rail workers are suffering as a result.” On Thursday Kean labelled the unions claims “outrageous” and “a disgrace”, while Tudehope said he would recommend that the government not bend to the union’s demands. He indicated the government could seek to terminate its current agreement with the union if it attempted to enforce a clause that he said could be “misconceived” as giving the union the power to refuse to operate the trains. “[We would be] left in a position where we will need to seek the termination of the agreement with the union on the basis they are abusing the provisions of that clause to prevent a perfectly able train to run on our network, so that’s where we are,” Tudehope said. The extraordinary intervention blindsided RTBU NSW secretary Alex Claassens, who just hours earlier had received a letter from the deputy secretary of Transport for NSW confirming the department would “continue discussions to collaboratively develop an interim approach” to operate the fleet. He accused Tudehope of pulling “another stunt” after the February network shutdown. “He’s trying to get us to be angry and react and take industrial action, and he’ll try and take us back to the Fair Work Commission and try and cancel our action, but unfortunately for him we’re going to be the adults in the room,” Claassens said. “We’re going to be out there calling on all the cabinet members to come and talk to us. Listen to what we’ve got to say. I’ve got no doubt the sensible people in that room will understand.” The union boss said he had spent five weeks negotiating in good faith and would be back at the table next week to continue the talks, while stopping short of completely ruling out further actions. Classens said he still had a good working relationship with the transport minister, David Elliott, and confirmed that he contacted the premier, Dominic Perrottet, about the breakdown in relations immediately. Elliott – who was not at the government’s snap Thursday press conference – was asked about the letter from Transport for NSW in parliament, to which he responded that he was “just a suburban dad trying to right some wrongs”. Labor accused the government of attempting to “cause chaos” on the trains. “That is grossly irresponsible behaviour from Matt Kean and Damien Tudehope,” the opposition’s transport spokesperson, Jo Haylen, said. “It’s playing politics with our transport network and it is enflaming an industrial dispute which the government is meant to be solving through negotiations.”",News/Australia news,NSW minister accused of trying to ‘blow up’ negotiations with rail union,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/12/nsw-minister-accused-of-trying-to-blow-up-negotiations-with-rail-union

A total of 6.4 million patients were awaiting treatment that month – a 3% increase on the 6.2 million in February.

The number of people waiting more than two years fell from its January high, 23,778, to below 17,000 in April. An NHS spokesperson said the record waiting list was partly down to the fact “increasing numbers of people are coming forward following the pandemic with 1.8 million people referred for treatment in March”. Prof Stephen Powis, the national medical director for NHS England, said: “We always knew the waiting list would initially continue to grow as more people come forward for care who may have held off during the pandemic, but today’s data show the number of people waiting more than two years has fallen for the second month in a row, and the number waiting more than 18 months has gone down for the first time. “There is no doubt the NHS still faces pressures, and the latest figures are another reminder of the crucial importance of community and social care, in helping people in hospital leave when they are fit to do so, not just because it is better for them but because it helps free up precious NHS bed space.” More details soon …",News/Society,NHS England waiting list reaches another record high in March,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/12/nhs-england-waiting-list-another-record-high-march
5/12/2022,"Iwas very fit and healthy when I was deployed for the Gulf war. I ran to work every morning and led the military fitness training. I was also into motocross and used to play rugby. Now, after 30 years of suffering from “Gulf war syndrome”, I still struggle to breathe and just a month ago I had to have an injection in my spine to block the pain from my damaged nerves. For decades since the Gulf war, thousands of veterans have suffered from mystery illnesses. Part of that suffering has been not knowing the cause of that illness and not knowing what was really happening to my body. Now US scientists, partly funded by the American government, say what caused thousands of soldiers like me to fall sick was the nerve agent sarin, released into the air when Iraqi chemical weapons stocks were bombed. I worked primarily as a tank transporter in the Gulf, driving ahead on a motorbike to find safe routes through the desert. Soldiers in the tanks were probably safe inside, but I only had a cloth over my mouth to prevent me swallowing bugs or sand, and so was heavily exposed to chemicals in the air. On returning from the war I received treatment for PTSD. But the doctors noticed that something was wrong: my body as well as my mind was affected. My joints became incredibly sore, I struggled to breathe and started to suffer from chronic fatigue. This, of course, exacerbated my PTSD. I am not alone in suffering these symptoms. I’m one of a relatively small number receiving a war pension for my service in the Gulf, but I know there are likely far more struggling. (Research by the Royal British Legion suggests that although 1,300 people in the UK receive a war pension for service in the Gulf, 33,000 veterans have Gulf war syndrome.) My doctors guessed this right. They wrote off the idea that I had been exposed to depleted uranium deposits, and suspected exposure to chemical weaponry instead. In the US, the government has long recognised the existence of Gulf war syndrome. However, despite all the evidence, Britain’s Ministry of Defence denied that Gulf war syndrome even existed until 2005. In 2010, it was refusing the majority of claims for war pensions from veterans suffering from the condition. Most veterans with symptoms do not receive a war pension for service in the Gulf to this day. This matters to me because the time I served in the Gulf and what happened to me there had a huge effect on my life and does to this day. I still suffer from PTSD, and the physical pain makes it worse. My family life has fallen apart. The support that I have had in recent years has been from charities and doctors, who have gone out of their way to help me. But I feel ignored by the government. Even now I face a lack of clarity over my pension. We can’t turn back the clock, but now that we have strong reason to believe these debilitating illnesses are caused by exposure to sarin gas, I want the MoD to say sorry for ignoring what doctors and veterans were telling them. The suicide rate among Gulf war veterans is high and the parents of veterans who took their own lives as well as the thousands of us who continue to suffer from exposure to sarin deserve confirmation of what we are now being told. But most of all we deserve an apology.

He is further infuriated by Iago’s degrading animal imagery. An usher shushes him. “You’re spoiling it for everyone,” he says. The boy is quick to respond: “They’re spoiling it for me.” Unwilling to be thrown out, the boy takes to the stage. Like an egalitarian Thomas Bowdler, he is on a mission to rewrite Shakespeare. Out must come the othering language, the insulting talk of the “beast with two backs”, and the implication that a union between Gabriel Akamo’s black Othello and Rayyah McCaul’s white Desdemona presents a problem. The boy wants an end of labels and an acceptance of possibility. Stepping out of character as Desdemona, McCaul morphs into Cathy, a needy actor, grateful for getting her first gig in two years. She thinks she might be to blame for the disruption. Preparing a backstory in rehearsals, the actor imagined Desdemona had been pregnant with twins. She hadn’t thought through the implications of bringing mixed-heritage children into the world, but here is Harris Cain’s Nothello stepping out of the audience to put her right. Joining him is Aimee Powell as his sister, Desdeknownow. She has spent the past four centuries auditioning for a part (“not too black, not too white”) that never comes her way. Now is their time. In Mojisola Adebayo’s clever and joyful play – partly inspired by conversations with residents of Coventry, the home of 2 Tone – the twins wear down Alex Scott Fairley’s Iago and their would-be parents in order to stop the age-old repetition of racist tropes. They need a happy ending in order to be born. It runs for only 75 minutes, but somehow Justine Themen’s production also finds time to comment on the death of George Floyd, gender fluidity and Covid (“Try being locked down for 400 years,” says Powell).

5/12/2022,"The new chairman of GB News has a history of sharing articles that dismiss the threat of climate breakdown, it can be revealed, sharpening concerns about the TV channel’s role as a platform for advocates of the continued burning of fossil fuels. Alan McCormick, a co-founder of Legatum Group, a Dubai-based investment firm and one of the channel’s key funders, tweeted several articles by climate science deniers, an investigation by DeSmog found, including one claiming there was “no scientific proof” that humans were causing the climate emergency. GB News frequently hosts guests who cast doubt on climate science and oppose green polices, including the Net Zero Scrutiny Group (NZSG) of Conservative MPs. In March, Nigel Farage, one of the channel’s main presenters, launched a call for a “net zero referendum” on the UK’s climate targets, modelled on his Brexit campaign. McCormick, whose appointment was made public at the end of April, has also tweeted praise for calls for economic deregulation in the UK by the Tory MP Steve Baker. Baker is also leading the NZSG’s backbench revolt against the UK’s 2050 net zero goal and is a trustee of the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), which opposes action on the climate crisis. McCormick’s tweets about climate change, reviewed by DeSmog, appeared between 2013 and 2017 and mostly consisted of an article headline and a link without comment. In March 2015, he tweeted a Wall Street Journal article headlined “The Political Assault on Climate Skeptics”. The writer was Richard S Lindzen, a US scientist who has received thousands of dollars from fossil fuel-funded thinktanks and said believing carbon dioxide is the main cause of climate change is “pretty close to believing in magic”. The same month, McCormick tweeted “Why I am a climate sceptic”, an article by Patrick Moore published by the Heartland Institute, a US fossil fuel-backed thinktank. In it, Moore suggests claims that humans are behind the climate emergency are scientifically unsound and calls on readers to “celebrate carbon dioxide”. In May 2017, McCormick tweeted a WSJ editorial in which the columnist Holman W Jenkins Jr writes that “climate advocacy has morphed into a religion”. The climate sceptic tweets appear to stop in 2017 but McCormick recently retweeted an article by the GWPF adviser Matt Ridley recycling unproven claims that anti-fracking protests have been funded by Russia. McCormick’s appointment as chairman of GB News’s parent company, All Perspectives Ltd, was first reported by Guido Fawkes, the political blog. Companies House records show he has been a director since April 2021. He and two other men involved in Legatum – Mark Stoleson, its Maltese chief executive, and Christopher Chandler, a New Zealand-born billionaire – are listed as “persons with significant control”, meaning they hold at least a quarter of shares or voting rights. GB News has not only emerged as an arena for Conservative MPs opposed to net zero to make their case, but also employs presenters who have used the channel to promote climate sceptic views. Last summer, Dan Wootton, the former Sun showbiz editor, used his platform on GB News to accuse the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of using “hysterical” language and “spreading terror”. Last month, Darren Grimes accused the UK government of “net zero zealotry” in a self-described “ode to oil”. Farage, brought in as GB News’s main presenter after the departure of the founding chairman and broadcasting heavyweight Andrew Neil, has likened his net zero campaign to his push for Brexit. Jennie King, from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue thinktank, said GB News had become a “central hub” for climate scepticism in the British media, and that “its influence increasingly extends beyond UK borders”. “Using GB News as a platform, Farage and others have almost single-handedly manufactured controversy around a net zero referendum, despite minimal evidence of public support,” King said. “Such content not only influences policymaking in the UK, but is excerpted and used by anti-climate movements across the globe.” Legatum and GB News did not respond to requests for comment.",News/Media,GB News chairman has history of dismissing threat of climate crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/12/gb-news-chairman-alan-mccormick-has-history-of-dismissing-threat-of-climate-crisis

How was that?The tech team did a terrific job; with Bethany Firth, the swimmer who won gold for Team GB at the Paralympics, we had her mum on the line just as her hand touched the wall, which was brilliant. The other benefit of being here is that you know what’s catching on and what people are responding to, which you don’t always know when you’re in another time zone. Of course, the big difference since the last Olympic cycle is that athletes have more confidence in their own voice, whether that’s Simone Biles or Emily Campbell, the weightlifter who wanted to use her platform to talk about body image. They have become much more vocal, and they represent more than just sport.

When we speak, she has just set up an old friend with a new one she met through yoga. “They hit it off straight away,” she says. She is waiting for a positive outcome from another pair too: “I haven’t given up on them yet.” A generation ago, the Sarahs of this world were in heavy demand: your extended network was the first place you’d look for love. For a while, it seemed that technology had made them redundant: a 2019 Stanford University study showed the proportion of couples who had met through friends had plummeted, displaced by online dating. But, as the Tinder era enters its second decade, many single people are once again yearning for a more personal romantic approach. This could be why nearly 70% of respondents to a 2020 Pew Research Center survey said their dating lives were not going well. “It’s become easy to meet, but harder to connect,” says Lakshmi Rengarajan, a New York-based workplace consultant at WeWork and elsewhere, who has been pairing people up for over a decade. Her goal has always been to “make dating more human”, she says. But the pandemic presented her with her biggest challenge yet. “All of a sudden, everybody had no choice but to use the apps.” In response, Rengarajan started the podcast Paired by the People, which is dedicated to reviving the art of the setup. In each episode, Rengarajan interviews a couple whose meeting was engineered by friends, or sets up strangers herself, with a view to showing listeners how they might go about it. As confident as they might be about making connections elsewhere in life, says Rengarajan, many people feel unsure about how to facilitate or request a date, worrying it could be intrusive to offer or desperate to ask. “I think they have a very antiquated notion of what a setup looks like,” she says. So, if you are single and want to be set up, how should you go about it? First, Rengarajan says, be clear about it with your friends – but only tell them the absolute deal-breakers for your potential partner such as sexuality or politics. “At the most basic level, it’s saying: ‘I am open to being introduced.’” Providing them with a laundry list of desired characteristics piles on too much pressure – and goes against the setup’s spirit of serendipity. “The language is important: don’t use words like ‘perfect’ or ‘match’ – even ‘good for me’ has a lot of judgment,” Rengarajan says. The perfect phrasing, she suggests, is “someone you think I would get along with”. “Give them permission to go with their gut, and tell them that if it doesn’t work out, it’s not a big deal.” By putting them at ease, says Rengarajan, you lower the stakes for yourself, too. Dating apps can make us so particular and quick to judge, she says, but if a friend has put in the effort of choosing someone for you, you are less likely to dismiss them out of hand. “People have a very low tolerance for awkward conversations. With a setup, I think your tolerance is slightly higher: ‘I’m not going to discard this person immediately – I’m going to at least let them finish their latte.’” If you are finding someone a date, be thoughtful, but don’t overthink it. “Don’t ask yourself if they could get married, or even if they could spend eight hours together,” says Rengarajan. “Just imagine: would they get along?” Rather than explicitly setting up her housemate and colleague, Imogen “deliberately and repeatedly” engineered for them to meet at social events. “I was sure they would fall in love: they’re both into philosophy and the same Korean restaurant in east London.” When they eventually went on a date, “I was so excited that my scheming and string-pulling had worked,” says Imogen, 32. But her housemate called it off abruptly, hurting her colleague’s feelings – “and now she doesn’t want to come round to my house any more”, says Imogen. “I sort of wish I’d left it well enough alone.” But Imogen doesn’t think that a more considered setup would have had a happier ending – it might have made her feel even more guilty, she says. “I think that’s something you have to be ready for if you do an explicit set-up. Rengarajan’s response to such disasters is sanguine. “What I always say to people is, your friends have sent you to bad restaurants, bad parties or bad vacation spots, and you didn’t punish them for that. I think good friendships can survive this.” The introduction itself is crucial, Rengarajan says. Many people give recommendations, such as: “She’s a great friend,” which are too general to be telling. Sharing an entire relationship history, on the other hand, might extinguish a potential romance prematurely. Instead, Rengarajan swears by offering a telling anecdote. “I can tell you ‘Bob is a great guy,’ or I can tell you ‘Bob is such a good friend, he helped me move into my fourth-floor walk-up apartment in New York in the summer.’” Such stories prime the pair to see each other as rounded individuals, rather than just another date, she says. “It’s unbelievable how it changes the trajectory – they even start to look different to you.” Bonnie, 36, encouraged her housemate to go on a date with her friend, and they are now married with two children. “I joke that the reason I suggested they invite each other for a drink was that they both have great taste in balsamic vinegar, and that Polly would be able to hold her own when Tom inevitably launched into a long conversation about international relations,” she says. “In truth, they were simply both a couple of the smartest, most well-put-together and funniest people I knew – I just had a feeling.” And that feeling was reciprocated: “A nudge was all they needed – that first drink turned into a three-day date,” says Bonnie. After making the introduction, you could check in to see whether your friends have made plans to meet (and give a gentle push if not: inbox overwhelm is real, says Rengarajan), or suggest a venue or activity. But the rest is down to them, for better or worse. “I don’t think you should feel entitled to an update,” she says. It is natural to feel some trepidation about bringing friends together, Rengarajan says, but the worst-case scenario could be no more than slight awkwardness. “You will survive running into an ex, or having to rearrange your dinner party.” In fact, involving more people in your search for love can make it feel fun. On one episode of Paired by the People, Rengarajan interviewed a woman who roped her friends into finding her 12 dates for her “date of the month club”. “I’m not looking for Mr Perfect, I’m looking for Mr November,” Jenny Tolan told them in her explanatory email. Her friends responded with enthusiasm – and Tolan ended up marrying Mr July. For anyone burnt out by dating, Rengarajan says, this approach can be refreshing. “People think it’s this big production, and it’s not. You can have fun with it. “We do know how to do this,” she adds. Our instincts might be rusty – “but I don’t think they’re gone”. Sarah, for one, is confident that her latest introduction will eventually pay off. “I think it’s a match made in heaven … I wish a friend would do it for me.” Case studies’ names and some identifying details have been changed",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘I was sure they would fall in love!’ The dos and don’ts of amateur matchmaking,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/12/dos-and-do-nots-of-amateur-matchmaking
5/12/2022,"The first streaming service I subscribed to was Hulu, back in 2009. It was free, with very little content, so the effort-to-reward ratio of setting up a password was almost too extravagant to bother with. I guess Netflix came next – the first subscription service I paid for. Netflix had nothing much on it, either, back in 2011, but at $8 a month, the price point was so tempting it somehow seemed cheaper than free. Then came Amazon Prime Video, included in the annual Prime package. At the time, my monthly cable bill was about $140 a month, and this new model offered a startling promise: not only to slash my bills, but to obviate the need to deal with Time Warner Cable ever, ever again. Well, ha, as they say. Ten years later, from such humble beginnings, I dare not do the maths on my monthly subscriptions. My Netflix bill has almost doubled, Hulu is no longer free, and they have been joined by a clutch of other streaming services that, cheap in isolation, almost certainly add up to more than cable used to be. In our house, as well as those original streamers, we have Disney+, HBOMax and Peacock Premium Plus. I use someone else’s password for Brit Box. I pay for a VPN to get BBC iPlayer. For the longest time, I held out against Apple TV – I didn’t need to see The Morning Show – but this month caved and subscribed, to watch Severance. My line in the sand is Showtime. I nearly did it, for Yellowjackets, but held my nerve and after reports that the series went off a cliff after episode three, am confident that I made the right call. I won’t do Paramount+ and don’t even talk to me about Starz. The whole situation has become ridiculous and every month, glancing at my outgoings, I tell myself something has to go. It’s not a singular frustration. Last month, Netflix reported a first quarter net loss of 200,000 subscribers, with million further losses predicted and an almost 35% plunge in the company’s share price. A few days later, CNN+, a subscription service off-shoot of CNN, announced it would be closing. Consumers are tapped out, financially, and otherwise. Post-pandemic, we are, apparently, going out more, with less time for TV. There’s too much, In the case of Netflix, it’s also a question of quality. In the last few years, the company has vastly overpaid for questionable content, including the laughable $100m it paid for Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and Prince Harry’s whimsical ideas, a spend that has backfired. Last week, it killed Pearl, the cartoon Meghan was apparently working on with – and this makes me laugh every time – David Furnish, and that along with the couple’s other unrealised jottings, will be a footnote in the overall demise of the company. At least Netflix saved on production costs; over the last few years, plenty of expensive garbage has actually made it to screen. (Girlboss, anyone? How about Snowpiercer?) As a result, Netflix announced this week that by the end of the year, it will in all likelihood have introduced ads, as other streamers including Hulu have done. The company also suggested it might crack down on password sharing. Last month, Netflix mentioned during its earnings call that something like 100 million households share their passwords, a fact that might incur a small extra fee when the streamer detects any given account being used at more than one address. This seems reasonable. (I shared my Netflix password with a friend, who shared it with her mother, then changed my password when the streamer cut us off; you can’t watch Netflix on more than two screens simultaneously without paying extra. Now I’m back to sharing with the same friend – not her mother – but am still obliged to call her, occasionally, and yell at her to kick her son off his screen, while she’s on hers, so I can get on mine. There’s a lesson in all this that goes beyond subscription etiquette.) I would cancel Netflix at this point, if I could. As in 2011, there’s nothing on it I want to watch. Among all the bad decisions, however, the streamer has made a very good one: investing in tween shows like Sam & Cat, starring Ariana Grande, and Henry Danger, both of which my seven-year-olds are addicted to. Cutting them off would cause more turmoil than I have the energy for. Also: cake shows. My kids have the entire Disney library at their disposal, but – testament to the quirks of the market and how hard it is to guess what will keep an audience hungry – would rather watch someone make a cake that looks like a shoe.

5/12/2022,"Surging cases of the flu are putting extra demand on emergency departments around New South Wales, with major outbreaks in boarding houses contributing to a doubling in cases in a week. According to NSW Health, 2,000 flu cases were reported in the week to 7 May – up from 1,024 the week before. The state’s chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said there has also been about 60 people hospitalised with flu-like illnesses over the same period, adding further strain to an already struggling system. She urged all people who could to get their flu vaccination, including students in boarding schools who were particularly vulnerable, to do so. “As with Covid-19, boarding schools are a high-risk setting for flu transmission,” she said. “We’re strongly encouraging all students and staff in boarding schools to get their flu vaccine. Boarders with flu should be isolated from others until their symptoms resolve.” Schools with three or more boarders with the flu were told to contact their local public health unit for advice. Health experts have been warning that this flu season would probably be worse than previous pandemic years after historically low transmission rates of influenza last year, largely attributed to border closures and lockdowns. Immunisation Coalition chief executive, Kim Sampson, said it has not been a good start to the flu season because “people have kind of stopped caring”. “[People are] rolling their eyes and don’t really want to know about it,” he said. “There is considerable concern that we’re going to see this escalation in cases progress through the coming months. “As it gets colder, wetter and people stay indoors for longer periods, then we really do expect it to increase. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Key among Sampson’s concerns was the chance of people getting Covid and the flu at the same time, and creeping “vaccine fatigue” leading to lower than usual take-up of the jab. “If we start to see an increase of co-infection, we don’t know what impact that’s going to have on the health system,” he said. NSW’s seniors minister, Mark Coure, said residents 65 and over were eligible for a free flu shot at pharmacies and GPs. He said it was important every year and “especially important this year” given the stubbornly high number of Covid cases in the community still. “We have come a long way and have a strong Covid-19 vaccination rate, but it is important to take any additional steps we can to protect ourselves and others as we head into the winter months,” Coure said. “The flu shot and Covid-19 booster can be given at the same time, so if you are yet to get either, make sure to book in today.”",News/Australia news,Surge in NSW flu cases sparks concern over hospital capacity with Covid numbers high,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/12/surge-in-nsw-flu-cases-sparks-concern-over-hospital-capacity-with-covid-numbers-high
5/12/2022,"Boris Johnson has refused to rule out the introduction of a windfall tax which would help to relieve pressure on the cost of living crisis. Speaking to LBC’s Nick Ferrari, Johnson said that while he believed a disadvantage of windfall tax would be the impact it would have on investment, the prospect of such a tax was still something to be looked at. Johnson said: “The disadvantage with those sorts of taxes is that they deter investment in the very things that they need to be investing in – new technology, in new energy supply.” When asked by Ferrari whether he would completely rule out a windfall tax, Johnson did not say whether that would be the case, instead saying that he did not “like them”. He added: “I didn’t think they’re the right thing. I don’t think they’re the right way forward. I want those companies to make big, big investments.” The comments come in response to Bernard Looney, the chief executive of BP, saying that BP’s plans for investment would not be affected by a windfall tax. Robert Halfon, a Conservative MP and the chair of the education select committee, has joined calls for oil companies to be subject to a windfall tax, labelling their executives as “the new oligarchs”. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “I do think that the government should consider properly a windfall tax. “Oil companies or oil bosses are the new oligarchs – one of them earning a salary over £76m, getting a £4.5m bonus.” Reports suggest that the Treasury was also considering introducing a windfall tax to help ease the cost of living crisis. According to the Daily Mail, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has asked Treasury officials to look into plans to introduce the tax, with a source telling the paper that a one-off levy would be a “no-brainer if the chief executives themselves are saying they have no problem with it”. The proposal of a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas has been a policy the Labour party has pledged over the past few months, with Labour estimating that the tax would reduce the average household energy bill by £200 and would remove VAT from domestic energy bills over a year. Profits on North Sea oil and gas firms are taxed at 30% corporation tax plus a 10% surcharge, however Labour have proposed raising the combined rate to 50%. On Tuesday, Labour said that a windfall tax could raise more than £2bn.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson says windfall tax ‘not the right thing’ but refuses to rule out U-turn,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/12/boris-johnson-says-windfall-tax-not-the-right-thing-but-refuses-to-rule-out-u-turn
5/12/2022,"The boss of John Lewis has urged the government to intervene with a financial package of support to protect families from the cost of living crisis on the same scale as it did to help the UK deal with the Covid pandemic. Dame Sharon White, a former second permanent secretary at the Treasury, said the government needed to act urgently because families were struggling to pay utility and food costs as energy bills and inflation soared. “The time has absolutely come for action whether it is an emergency budget or whether it is another vehicle,” said White, speaking on ITV’s Peston show on Wednesday night. The chair of John Lewis Partnership, which also owns the Waitrose supermarket chain, said action needed to be taken before summer, with consumers facing another increase in energy bills of as much as £1,000 annually from October. She said: “The decisive action we saw, I thought the government did incredibly well at the pace and scale during Covid, I think we need to see the same decisive action taken at speed and at pace.” White added that the UK faced “at least as pressing a challenge with the cost of living crisis” as it did with the pandemic, making the cost to public finances an “imperative”. “The hit is either going to happen to households, to families, to people on low incomes, or we take a decision that given the scale and everything that’s happening … actually a temporary hit on public finances is worth it.” White said that consideration needed to be given to a “windfall tax” on energy firms – last week BP and Shell announced bumper profits thanks to soaring energy prices – to subsidise the cost of bills consumers faced. “I think it’s the right territory, I think certainly the government and the regulator [Ofgem] need to act on that second rise,” she said. “Now a windfall tax, it’s not perfect but actually given the severity and the urgency of the situation, I think it’s a reasonable approach.” On Thursday, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, indicated that there could be a U-turn on government resistance to a windfall tax, which he has previously said could deter energy firms from continuing to invest in new projects. “The disadvantage with those sort of taxes is that they deter investment in the very things that we need to see them putting them in,” he said, speaking on LBC. “They need to be investing in new technology, in new energy supplies for the UK.” The host, Nick Ferrari, interjected to say that the energy companies have said a windfall tax would not deter them from continuing to pursue a long-term strategy of investing to move away from fossil fuel based energy sources. “Well then we’ll have to look at it,” said Johnson. “What I say is I want them to make those investments – they’ve got to be making those investments – in new energy supply for our country.” White is the latest prominent retail leader to publicly call for urgent government action, after the Tesco’s chair, John Allan, said on Tuesday there was an “overwhelming case” for a windfall tax on energy companies to help those struggling the most with the cost of living crisis. Allan said the UK was facing “real food poverty for the first time in a generation.” Analysis by the Labour party estimated that a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas operators could raise more than £2bn to cushion the pain of rising energy bills. Profits on North Sea oil and gas firms are taxed at 30% corporation tax plus a 10% surcharge. Labour has proposed hiking the combined rate from 40% to 50%. In March, the OBR increased its forecasts for UK oil and gas tax receipts by £5.2bn to £13bn in the year to April 2023, up from £3.1bn in the previous financial year. That is far higher than before the pandemic and is the highest return from the North Sea since 2010-11, when £9.6bn was collected. On top of soaring energy bills, inflation is forecast to hit a 40- year high of 10% by the end of the year while the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government’s independent economic forecaster, has said that living standards are falling at their fastest annual rate since the 1950s.",News/Media,John Lewis boss calls for Covid-style cost of living aid package,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/12/john-lewis-boss-says-cost-of-living-help-must-match-covid-package
5/12/2022,"The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, is to hold talks with the vice-president of the European Commission, Maroš Šefčovič, in the first meeting since the UK threatened to remove parts of the Northern Ireland Brexit protocol. The attorney general for England and Wales, Suella Braverman, is said to have approved the scrapping of large parts of the Northern Ireland Brexit deal, according to reports. The move came as a leading US congressman, Brendan Boyle, described the government’s plans to move away from a treaty it signed two years ago as a “very frustrating” and “counterproductive” pattern that is causing concern in Washington. The Washington ad hoc committee to protect the Good Friday agreement described the UK’s plans as “neither strategic or wise” and said it would not have the support of Joe Biden. We look forward to meeting @ConorBurnsUK this Friday. Tearing up the Protocol, which is boosting the NI economy, & starting a trade war with the larger EU in order to protect the GFA is neither strategic or wise & won’t sell @POTUS. Fully implementing GFA much more promising Braverman has advised that legislation to override the Northern Ireland protocol would be legal because the European Union’s implementation of it is “disproportionate and unreasonable”, the Times has reported. In evidence to her findings, Braverman says the EU is undermining the Good Friday agreement by creating a trade barrier in the Irish Sea and fuelling civil unrest, the newspaper said. The development echoes a major row 18 months ago within the Tory party after the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, unveiled plans to override parts of the protocol as part of draft internal market legislation. Lewis claimed the government’s legislation would break international law only “in a very specific and limited way” but the plans were ultimately abandoned. Liz Truss on Wednesday rejected the EU’s proposals to resolve a standoff over post-Brexit trade rules for Northern Ireland, saying it would not shy away from taking direct action in a move Ireland said would trigger legal action by Brussels. On Wednesday the Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, warned the EU would launch legal action and possibly impose countermeasures against Britain that could range from sanctions on goods such as Scottish salmon and whisky to suspension of the entire trade deal negotiated by the former Brexit minister David Frost. Coveney told RTÉ on Thursday he believed there was a “landing zone” and that checks should not be conducted on goods destined for Northern Ireland only, a compromise already on the table. However, he said the EU would not respond to threats to scrap the protocol in parts if Brussels did not give in to the entire UK demands. “That is not the way to approach the issue and I think everybody knows that,” he said. The threats by the UK government to introduce a law to disapply parts of the protocol which, if implemented in full, would mean physical and customs checks on food and some other goods, were already causing a rift within the Tory party and with EU leaders. Between 30 and 50 Conservative MPs canvassed by colleagues said they had significant doubts about whether they could vote for a bill that would unpick an international treaty. Most dismissed the prospect of the bill’s success and described it as a negotiating tactic. Senior MPs warned there were a number of ministers prepared to resign if faced with passing the bill into law. Sources close to Truss have stressed that no final decision has been made and that any potential legislation is intended to run in parallel with further talks. Coveney said a briefing by Truss to the press on Wednesday had gone down “very badly” within Europe. The UK is also coming under pressure from the US to drop its antagonistic approach in the wake of the election in Northern Ireland. Boyle said the UK should listen to the majority of people in Northern Ireland who, he said, did not vote for the protocol to be abandoned. “Ever since almost the moment that Boris Johnson and David Frost negotiated the Northern Ireland protocol and signed it, it seems as if every other month or so, they’re threatening to rip it up and unilaterally walk away, so it is a very frustrating cycle that we’ve had to deal with over the last several years, completely counterproductive, and not in accordance with the expressed wishes of the majority of Northern Ireland. “Literally two days ago, the people of Northern Ireland elected pro-protocol parties and candidates by a margin of 60% to 40%, right? So I think we should actually listen to the overwhelming majority of people in Northern Ireland,” he said. The Northern Ireland minister, Conor Burns, styled under a new title of special representative to the US on the protocol, was dispatched to Washington this week to speak to senior US figures about the negotiations. Boyle said the UK embassy had asked on Wednesday for him to meet Burns but it was unclear whether a meeting could be arranged in time. He was sceptical of the need for changes to the protocol.",News/Politics,Liz Truss to hold talks with EU amid threats to overhaul NI protocol,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/12/attorney-general-approves-scrapping-of-ni-protocol-reports-liz-truss-brexit
5/12/2022,"For most of human history, we were caught in a stagnation trap. Improvements in technology and productivity led to population increases, and all those new people gobbled up the surplus, so that overall living standards always reverted to the historical average, barely above subsistence. Thomas Malthus, the unfairly maligned English clergyman, assumed this would always be the case. And yet, at least in the fortunate global north, things have been very different for the last century or so. How come? This is the question the economist Oded Galor devised his rather grandiosely named “Unified Growth Theory” to address. (He uses lots of metaphors from physics, including “phase transition”, “economic black hole”, “gravitational forces”, and the like.) His answer, briefly, is that we sprang free of the Malthusian trap because of the effect the Industrial Revolution had on fertility rates. Rapid technological change placed a higher value on education, and families invested more in children’s schooling, which meant they could not afford to have so many children as before. So productivity gains were not swallowed up by burgeoning population. This virtuous cycle has persisted until the present, and might even, Galor suggests with unfashionable optimism, help us combine continued growth in living standards with reductions in carbon emissions. The outline of this theory in the first half of the book is enjoyable and intriguing, if somewhat schematic in its picture of quasi-physical “fundamental forces” or “great cogs” operating over millennia of human history. The second half tackles what economists call the great divergence: why, given the above story, do we see such extreme global inequalities now? Here we enjoy a brief interlude in which the author gives some causal weight to ideas. Different legal systems and political institutions meant that some countries were in a position to profit more than others – for example, England’s 1689 bill of rights, its financial system, and the relative weakness of its artisan guilds (so that they could not block threatening inventions), are all argued to have given it a head start. Galor also follows Weber in suggesting that Protestantism was crucial to the development of modern capitalism, and that the most important invention of the Enlightenment was the idea of progress itself. So far, so plausible. But, like a deep-time materialist, Galor is always looking to reduce the superstructure of ideas to something more tangible. Climate and geography, then, caused underlying differences in political systems: in places where native crops were suited to “large plantations”, such as Central America and the Caribbean, people were incentivised, so he argues, to adopt “centralised land ownership, which led to unequal wealth distribution, coerced labour and even slavery”. We may be thankful, then, for drizzly Europe. It is tempting for a “unified theory” of the “journey of humanity” to try to provide the key to all mythologies, and the book becomes more speculative and dubious, suggesting that the economic performance of entire modern societies can be explained by a kind of cultural memory of their ancestors’ interactions with one kind of crop or animal versus another. Galor also proposes that languages with politeness distinctions (tu and vous in French or du and Sie in German) have thereby enshrined more rigid hierarchies, and so harmed individual business enterprise. This reminded me pleasantly of the remark attributed to George W Bush: “The problem with the French is that they have no word for entrepreneur.” The book’s desire to uncover the “great cogs” of history devolves into a kind of impersonal conspiracy thinking. The penultimate chapter, more dangerously, claims to explain the differences in economic development in the modern world through population genetics. Galor argues that ethnic diversity has had conflicting effects: on the one hand it “has diminished interpersonal trust, eroded social cohesion, increased the incidence of civil conflicts, and introduced inefficiencies in the provision of public goods”. On the other hand it has “fostered economic development by widening the spectrum of individual traits, such as skills and approaches to problem-solving”. If this is so, then perhaps, a bean counter might dream, there is an amount of diversity that is just right. Galor finds that there is just such a “sweet spot”, and it can be found in a geographical Goldilocks zone – neither too near nor too far, in terms of migratory distance, from our ancestors’ first journey out of Africa – where the “diversity” of the population is allegedly ideal for creating an economy such as the Netherlands’ or Malaysia’s rather than Ethiopia’s or Bolivia’s. Here we encounter the limitations inherent in the publishing genre of “successful thinker lays out his pet theory as if it were the uncontroversial truth”. The original version of this argument appeared in a 2013 paper co-written with Quamrul Ashraf (“The ‘Out of Africa’ Hypothesis, Human Genetic Diversity, and Comparative Economic Development”), and attracted a highly critical public response from a number of biologists and anthropologists. “The argument is fundamentally flawed by assuming that there is a causal relationship between genetic diversity and complex behaviors such as innovation and distrust,” they observed; indeed, such “haphazard methods and erroneous assumptions of statistical independence could equally find a genetic cause for the use of chopsticks”. They warned, too: “The suggestion that an ideal level of genetic variation could foster economic growth and could even be engineered has the potential to be misused with frightening consequences to justify indefensible practices such as ethnic cleansing or genocide.” Galor responded at the time: “The entire criticism is based on a gross misinterpretation of our work and, in some respects, a superficial understanding of the empirical techniques employed.” He ends his recapitulation of the same argument here by asserting that “geographical characteristics and population diversity” are “predominantly the deepest factors behind global inequalities”, which sounds rather like we can’t do anything about them. Happily, at least, he does suggest that a country such as Ethiopia, which in his view is too genetically diverse, might be helped by “policies that enabled diverse societies to achieve greater social cohesion”. Meanwhile, Bolivia, which is allegedly too homogeneous, could achieve better economic growth by being more diverse and so benefiting from more “intellectual cross-pollination”. And so, though it has often seemed as if we can do little about his hidden “great cogs” and “fundamental triggers”, it appears cheeringly in the end that politics and ideas might at least sometimes trump their effects on the story of how we got here and where we might go next.

5/12/2022,"Gaspar Noé brings his cauterisingly fierce gaze to the spectacle of old age: the world of those about to enter the void. He brings to it a particular structural insight which I don’t think I have ever seen represented so clearly. Dying is bifurcated: a real-time split-screen experience divided between the carer and the cared-for. An old married couple, people who have had a lifetime to wonder which of them will die first and which of them will have to take up the burden of care, find that it is not so clear during the terrible endgame itself. Veteran director Dario Argento and actor, screenwriter and director Françoise Lebrun play a couple who live together in a small, chaotic Parisian apartment covered in an amiable clutter of books and papers. He is evidently a film-maker or maybe a writer, working on a book about cinema and dreams entitled Psyche; she is a retired psychiatrist. They have a son, Stéphane (Alex Lutz) who is himself the father of a small boy, and burdened with drug issues and money and marital worries. The movie opens – ominously – with a video clip of Françoise Hardy performing the 60s chanson Mon Amie la Rose, about the mortality of flowers. Then Argento and Lebrun enjoy a modest meal on their rickety terrace: these are Lebrun’s final moments of lucidity. We learn that she suffered a stroke a few years ago and has been descending into dementia since then; recently the rate of decline has accelerated. Noé splits the screen into two, dual stories running concurrently, showing in one half Argento’s character pottering thoughtfully about the flat, in denial about what is happening: reading, snoozing, clattering away at his manual typewriter and also leaving surreptitious phone messages, like a lovelorn teenager, for a woman called Claire with whom he has been miserably in love for decades. Meanwhile, on the left-hand side of the screen, Lebrun’s character, with the impassive, leonine expression of dementia patients, wanders off into the streets without telling her husband, or throws all his notes away, or dangerously leaves the gas on, all in a miserable haze of unknowing. Stéphane comes around to see them, deeply upset by what is happening, and by his own inability to persuade them to enter a care home; this is a subject complicated by his own history with his psychiatrist mother, stricken by the fact that he and they now live in a world of drugs, legal and illegal. Noé will periodically contrive a camera-cut in either of the frames and resume from another point of view; occasionally the two scenes will overlap creating a Hockneyesque perspective-dissonance. Brutally, the medium is the message. These two people will never again share the same screen. This is a movie without the pornographic and psychedelic sheen of Noé’s previous work, but those earlier pictures had a recurring trick: forcing audiences to the edge of nausea by making them stare into a vortex of flickering stroboscopic light. In this movie, death is the vortex: the dark focus, whose gravitational pull gets stronger – and harder to avoid thinking about – with every passing year. And Vortex tells us something else about old age, something which a severe and high-minded movie like Michael Haneke’s Amour would not grasp: death is chaotic, like life. It ends with things undone and in messy disarray. This is a work of wintry maturity, and real compassion.  Vortex is released on 13 May in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Vortex review – Gaspar Noé’s stunning split-screen descent into dementia,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/12/vortex-review-gaspar-noes-stunning-split-screen-descent-into-dementia
5/12/2022,"Seven of the nine runners in the Dante Stakes at York on Thursday hold entries in next month’s Derby and Stone Age’s recently acquired status as clear favourite for the Epsom Classic may be under threat if one of them can register a convincing success. Desert Crown has already shortened from 33-1 to 6-1 second-favourite for the Derby in the past 10 days without leaving Newmarket, as other potential candidates have come up short in their trials. El Bodegon, meanwhile, beat Stone Age in a Group One at St Cloud in October, and both Magisterial, a maiden winner at Leicester last month, and Aidan O’Brien’s Bluegrass also have the right profile to jump towards the top of the ante-post market with a victory. Desert Crown (3.35), however, already looks like more than a talking horse, as his winning time in a five-and-a-half length stroll on debut at Nottingham last November marked him down as Group-class colt in the making. Odds of around 3-1 look fair for Sir Michael Stoute’s colt to punch his ticket to Epsom. York 1.50 Copper Knight is going for his third straight success in this race but needs a career-best at the age of eight to win off 104, so Strong Power makes more appeal at around 12-1. Much improved on the all-weather this winter after joining Alice Haynes, he raced off 95 on his latest start in early April but runs off his 8lb lower turf mark here. Salisbury 2.05 Teumessias Fox starts out in handicaps on a mark of 84 and that looks workable based on his wide-margin success at Newcastle in early March. York 2.25 Little to choose between the three principals – Thunder Kiss, Noon Star and Ville De Grace – but the latter’s success in the Group Three Pride Stakes in October came in a strongly run contest and she may just have the edge at this trip. York 3.00 La Trinidad rarely runs a bad race in big-field handicaps over this track and trip, and a return to the form of his victory in a similar contest last July – off a 4lb lower mark – could well be enough for a third career win on the Knavesmire. York 4.10 Boonie looked to be an improved performer when scoring on his three-year-old debut at Nottingham last month and could have too much speed for King Of Bavaria, the favourite, who is dropping back in trip. Many horses were struggling to quicken on the ground here on Wednesday but Emily Upjohn was emphatically not among them. John and Thady Gosden’s filly shot away from her field with a sustained burst of speed two out in the Musidora Stakes, eventually crossing the line five-and-a-half lengths clear of Life Of Dreams, and is now clear favourite at around 6-4 for the Oaks on 3 June. This was a seventh Musidora winner for the Gosden stable and the record of the previous six in the Classic at Epsom a few weeks later is uninspiring, with the only three fillies that went on to run in the Oaks all beaten. Everything about Emily Upjohn’s win here suggested she will be the one to break the sequence, however, as the step up to a mile-and-a-half is likely to see further improvement from a filly with stamina on both sides of her pedigree. “A mile-and-a-half will be right up her alley and she couldn’t have done it any better, really,” John Gosden said afterwards.

We’ve been lucky enough to win [the Oaks] three times and she very much deserves to be in that league.” Frankie Dettori, Emily Upjohn’s jockey, suggested the winner is at a similar point at this stage of her career to Enable, the 2017 Oaks winner, who went on to take 11 Group One races in all. “The ground is a lot deeper than you think,” Dettori said, “and everybody was struggling from four out. I kept her together and from the two-and-a-half to the winning post I didn’t see another horse. “Enable won at Chester [before winning the Oaks] and she was probably on the same par. Every race she’s improving, she won by five lengths and I’m delighted with her.” Tuesday, who finished third in the 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket when making only the third start of her career, is the 4-1 second favourite for the Oaks while Charlie Appleby’s With The Moonlight, the Pretty Polly Stakes winner, is a 9-1 shot and the only other likely runner at single-figure odds.",Sport/Sport,Talking Horses: Stone Age’s status as Derby favourite under threat at York,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/11/emily-upjohn-made-clear-favourite-for-oaks-after-winning-musidora
5/12/2022,"The chief executive of the insurer Aviva has hit out at sexism in the industry, saying “unacceptable behaviour” has only increased since she took more senior roles in the sector. Amanda Blanc, who became the company’s first female chief executive in 2020, published a LinkedIn post thanking people for their support after shareholders made sexist remarks at the company’s annual general meeting on Monday. Investors said Blanc was “not the man for the job” and should be “wearing trousers”. “In all honesty, after 30-plus years in financial services I am pretty used to sexist and derogatory comments like those in the AGM,” she said in the post. Blanc continued: “I would like to tell you that things have got better in recent years but it’s fair to say that it has actually increased – the more senior the role I have taken, the more overt the unacceptable behaviour. “The surprising thing is that this type of stuff used to be said in private, perhaps from the safety of four walls inside an office – the fact that people are now making these comments in a public AGM is a new development for me personally.” Blanc, 54, is well known for being a female pioneer in male-dominated industries including the insurance sector, having worked her way to the chief executive role at Aviva after stints at Zurich Insurance, Axa and the Association of British Insurers. She has also served as chair of the Professional Rugby Board and sat on the board of the Welsh rugby union until November. Blanc was appointed the government’s women in finance champion in March 2021, succeeding the former Virgin Money chief Jayne-Anne Gadhia. The initiative asks City signatories to set voluntary targets towards gender diversity. Blanc said she hoped the insurance sector would achieve gender equality and could “slowly eradicate this type of occurrence for the next generation. But in truth that seems a long way off; even with the help of some fantastically supportive men who speak out on the issue.” The chair of Aviva, George Culmer, was one of the first to hit out at the sexist comments from shareholders, first reported by the Financial Times, saying they were “simply inappropriate” and should not be repeated at any future AGM. “I’m flabbergasted,” he said at the end of Monday’s meeting. The storm at Aviva has added to the perception that insurers have failed to address sexism and bullying across the sector. In March, the insurance market Lloyd’s of London was forced to issue its largest fine in its 336-year history over a bullying and harassment case involving one of its member firms, which hosted an inappropriate “boys’ night out” event for staff. Those parties took place annually for a number of years until 2018 – a year before the former shadow City minister Jonathan Reynolds accused the insurance market of being “institutionally sexist”.",News/Inequality,‘Unacceptable’: Aviva CEO hits back at shareholder sexism,https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2022/may/11/used-to-it-aviva-ceo-responds-after-sexist-comments-at-agm
5/12/2022,"BT has struck a deal with the US media company Warner Bros Discovery to create a joint venture pay-TV sport business, which will bring together rights to sports including the Premier League, the Champions League and the Olympics, worth as much as £633m to the telecoms operator. In February, BT entered into exclusive talks with the US firm to merge BT Sport with the Discovery-owned Eurosport, which broadcasts a wide range of sports including tennis and cycling and holds the pan-European rights to the Olympics in the UK. “We have finalised the sports joint venture with Warner Bros Discovery to improve our content offering to customers, aligning our business with a new global content powerhouse,” said Philip Jansen, chief executive of BT. Under the terms of the 50:50 joint venture, which will be operated by Warner Bros Discovery, BT will receive a £93m payment in instalments over three years after completion of the deal. BT will also receive up to £540m based on performance of the operation over a period of four years. This could pay out sooner if either the £540m performance cap is hit, or Warner Bros Discovery trigger a call option to take full control. The two companies said that the BT Sport and Eurosport brands would both initially continue to operate in the UK market “before being brought together under a single brand in the future”. “Our growing portfolio of premium entertainment content promises to deliver consumers a richer and deeper content proposition, not only providing greater value from their subscriptions but bringing sport to a wider entertainment audience,” said Andrew Georgiou, president and managing director of Warner Bros Discovery sports Europe. The company announced the deal as part of full-year results with BT reporting a 2% dip in revenues to £20.8bn, and a 9% increase in profits to £1.96bn, for the year to the end of March. Jansen said that the price increases in phone, TV and broadband bills pushed through on 1 April has so far not had an impact on customers cancelling services to save money. “Churn is pretty much at record lows,” he said. “One big part of what drives churn is value for money and pricing. Adding additional benefits and bundling of services for customers. It is working. We are not complacent, but what we are offering our customers is hitting our mark. “On average the price increases we are putting through are about £35 for a year … We know we give great value for money.” BT, which has raised its cost savings target by £500m to £2.5bn by the end of 2025, has spent billions on sports rights to drive the growth of BT Sport since it was launched a decade ago to stem the loss of millions of broadband customers enticed by its rival Sky’s offers bundling internet connectivity with sport and entertainment programming. The business succeeded in its job, although it only has a few million customers and turns just a small profit, and BT is now focused on its £15bn plans to roll out next-generation broadband and 5G mobile networks across the UK. “As a global sports and entertainment broadcaster Warner Bros Discovery is the perfect partner to work with us to take BT Sport to the next stage of its growth,” said Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s Consumer operation. BT, which has had to seek clearance from the Premier League and Champions League to push through the change in ownership, has also extended a reciprocal channel supply deal with Sky that is crucial to its sports broadcasting business until 2030.",News/Business,BT and Warner Bros Discovery join forces to create pay-TV sport business,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/12/bt-and-warner-bros-discovery-join-forces-to-create-pay-tv-sport-business
5/12/2022,"The New South Wales Liberal treasurer Matt Kean has warned of the dangers of a Trump-like shift to the right within the conservative party, as he pleaded with voters not to boot out moderate MPs in favour of teal independents on 21 May. The plea was supported by the state’s premier, Dominic Perrottet, who said voters would regret stepping away from the party if independents won seats over moderate Liberals. Speaking alongside the Wentworth MP Dave Sharma, Kean warned that unseating moderate Liberals would leave the party lacking important perspectives, drawing parallels to the Republican party in the US. “We’ve seen the impact of what happens when the centre-right parties lose moderate voices,” Kean said. “Look at the Republican party. The party of Lincoln, the party that has abolished slavery, has now become the party of Trump, the party of Putin sympathisers and anti-vaxxers. “That’s not in the Liberal party’s interest and that’s why we need strong voices like [federal NSW MPs] Dave Sharma, Trent Zimmerman and Jason Falinski in the Liberal party room to make sure the Liberal party remains reflective of the communities that we’re hoping to serve.” He said it was important to keep moderates including Sharma around “if the Liberal party is going to continue to be a modern party”. Sharma is facing a serious challenge from high-profile independent Allegra Spender, who has been campaigning strongly on climate and integrity issues. Spender hit back against Kean’s claims, saying the party was already “much like the Republican party” and claimed Wentworth would have “more power” from the crossbench than it did from Sharma’s position on the backbench. She pointed to Nationals senator Matt Canavan’s comments about the impacts of climate change and the debate within the Liberal party about the trans community. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The Republican party questions climate science and attacks the trans community,” Spender said. “The Liberal party already is much like the Republican party. “The past three years have shown Dave Sharma can’t stand up to Scott Morrison as his party tracks further to the right. “Our community will have more power from the crossbench, not the backbench.” Spender is one of a handful of “teal” candidates hoping to unseat inner-city Liberals across the country, including the federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, in his Melbourne seat of Kooyong. Perrottet, from the conservative side of the Liberal party, reiterated Kean’s pitch that diverse perspectives were important and urged party members to stick with them. “Those local communities will be better served having those members in parliament rather than independents. Independents … talk a lot, but they deliver very little,” he said. “The party is best served whilst maintaining its broad church. It was John Howard’s success as prime minister for many, many years. “People should not be turned away from the Liberal party because someone shares a different opinion. Our party’s at its best when you respect different ideas.” Perrottet said he was concerned people walked away rather than engaged in debate when they disagreed, warning he had seen people “regret it” in the past. “The best way to improve our party is to be part of it,” he said. When asked if the controversial Warringah Liberal candidate Katherine Deves would enrich the party’s broad church if she were elected, Perrottet reiterated he did not agree with “the way she’s expressed her views”. Deves apologised last month after a deluge of social media posts discussing the rights of transgender women and girls to participate in sport were uncovered, including claims that “half of all males with trans identities are sex offenders”.",News/Australia news,Matt Kean warns of Trump-like shift in Liberal party if teal independents oust moderates,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/12/matt-kean-warns-of-trump-like-shift-in-liberal-party-if-teal-independents-oust-moderates
5/12/2022,"Among the rightwing crusaders promoting Donald Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen, wealthy pillow entrepreneur Mike Lindell occupies a key niche, spending lavishly on lawsuits to ban voting machines in some states, endorsing big lie advocates for top offices in 2022 and financing an anti-voting machine film, plus related projects. In some respects, Lindell is an unlikely figure to emerge in the hotbed of US politics and the conservative ecosystem. As the chief executive of MyPillow he was once better known for his TV adverts than his extremist politics. But Lindell has become an ally of a still-powerful Trump who is eying a 2024 bid to return to the White House. Lindell has also become a popular figure on the right himself, making several appearances at recent Trump rallies. But election experts and voting watchdogs say Lindell’s legal blitz to ditch voting machines, and other drives that sustain Trump’s baseless claims about widespread fraud in the 2020 election, are deeply flawed and dangerous and potentially further damage voter confidence in elections. Lindell though sounds undaunted, telling the Guardian that he has spent about $30m to retain about 70 lawyers, cyber consultants, private investigators and other staffers for his projects to prove widespread fraud in the 2020 elections, despite mountains of contrary evidence, and expand his crusade to get rid of voting machines. Last month Lindell pumped about $500,000 dollars into an Arizona lawsuit filed by two Trump and Lindell backed state candidates for Secretary of State and Governor, Mark Finchem and Kari Lake, respectively, to obtain a preliminary injunction against voting machines that Lindell has repeatedly charged are defective. Lindell said that he plans to underwrite similar anti voting machine lawsuits in the next few months in many other states including Colorado, South Dakota, Texas, Wisconsin, Michigan and Alabama. “I’d like to file the lawsuits in all 50 states,” he said. “I didn’t come all this way not to succeed. We’ve got to get rid of them all.” To further spur his conservative agenda, Lindell has publicly endorsed several candidates for top posts in battleground states including Lake and Finchem, who early this month benefitted from a Trump sponsored fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago that Lindell attended. Lindell is also backing a candidate in Colorado for secretary of state, Tina Peters, a Mesa county elections clerk indicted on 10 counts for tampering with voting equipment in an effort to reveal what she thought were sizable election machine errors, who Lindell headlined a rally for last month. A judge on 10 May barred Peters from running the county elections this year; Peters remains a candidate to be Secretary of state but first has to win a June Republican primary. And in Michigan Lindell has bet on two Trump loyalists, Matt DePerno and Kristina Karamo who, respectively, were endorsed by a state Republican convention to be the Republican candidates this fall for attorney general and secretary of state. To promote his messages more widely, Lindell said he’s recruited ex-Fox News reporter Lara Logan, who claims she was “pushed out” by Fox after making incendiary comments comparing Anthony Fauci to notorious Nazi doctor Josef Mengele, to do a documentary about voting machine fraud and the voting machine companies that Lindell boasts will be “huge”. Moreover to help spread dubious claims of widespread election fraud, Lindell late last year launched Cause of America, a grassroots group whose self-styled mission is to “restore trust in local elections”, which Lindell said he’s subsidizing to the tune of $100,000 to $200,000 a month. Currently, to facilitate the CEO’s pricey lawsuits to get rid of voting machines, which legal and voting experts say face long odds, Lindell has retained a team of lawyers including Harvard Law professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz and Kurt Olsen, who was was subpoenaed on 1 March by the House committee binvestigating the 6 January Capitol attack by a mob of Trump loyalists. Election watchdogs say Lindell’s lawsuit spending spree is promoting conspiratorial views of voting fraud and has scant chance of legal success, but carries big risks to further confuse voters about the risks election fraud in 2020. Even William Barr, Trump’s own conservative attorney general, admitted in late 2020 there was no evidence of widespread fraud. “This is just another effort by proponents of the big lie to spread unsubstantiated conspiracy theories and undermine confidence in American elections,”Larry Norden, senior director for elections and government at the Brennan Center, said. “Like most other states, Arizona conducts its elections entirely on paper ballots and audits the machine results with a review of those ballots after the election is over,” he added. “ Every post-election review of the 2020 Arizona election, including the partisan review led by Cyber Ninjas, confirmed that Joe Biden won.” Norden stressed too that “hand-counting of ballots in any but the tiniest of jurisdictions is far too time-consuming and prone to human error to be feasible. Even in very small jurisdictions it would require trained election staff working in multi-member teams with oversight.” Other voting watchdogs offer similar views. “These ridiculous lawsuits are designed to continue undermining Americans’ confidence in every aspect of our electoral system, allowing Lindell and his cronies to decry any outcomes they don’t like as fraudulent,” Melanie Sloan, a senior adviser to the watchdog group American Oversight, said. ”Hand-counting ballots actually increases opportunities for fraud, but given that Lindell and Finchem were active participants in Trump’s efforts to overturn the election, it’s obvious there is no low to which they won’t stoop to foist their candidates on America, democracy be damned.” Lindell though is bullish about winning the class action lawsuits, despite dozens of other lawsuits by Trump lawyers to overturn the 2020 results that alleged fraud and that courts rejected “There’s no reason they won’t succeed,” Lindell boasted, adding that “the likelihood is very high”. Since Trump’s defeat, Lindell’s adamant advocacy that the election was rigged and his legal attacks on voting machines have sparked substantial legal headaches for the Minnesota-based mogul, a 60-year-old former crack addict and born-again Christian who once said Trump had been “chosen by God”. Two voting machine companies Lindell has portrayed as part of an election rigging operation have filed defamation lawsuits against him, and he has countersued at least one of them. Dominion Voting Systems filed a $1.3bn defamation lawsuit in February against Lindell, and a month later a judge declined Lindell’s efforts to dismiss the suit. Another voting equipment firm, Smartmatic, has also sued Lindell for defamation for an undisclosed amount. Further, the House Capitol attack committee subpoenaed Lindell’s phone records from 1 November, 2020 to 31 January 2021 as part of their inquiry, which prompted Lindell to sue the committee, House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Verizon to block the panel’s effort. Not surprisingly, Lindell angrily decried Pelosi and the committee’s inquiry as “election deflection. It’s all political and criminal.” Lindell, however, attended Trump’s “Save America” rally on the Ellipse prior to the Capitol attack where Trump urged the crowd to “fight like hell”, and he also attended a Trump rally in Georgia on 4 January where Trump railed without evidence that there was significant fraud. On 15 January, Lindell met briefly with Trump at the White House where the executive said he told Trump of “evidence” he had gathered that the voting machines were rigged. Incredibly to most experts, Lindell postulated that he has evidence Trump won by almost 15m votes with about 82m for Trump to some 67m for Biden, figures nowhere near the official total. Biden won by sabout 7m votes, or 81.2m for Biden, versus 74.2m for Trump. Norden of the Brennan Center noted that 93% of the 2020 votes were cast on paper ballots, including all the votes in the main battleground states, and that post-election audits “confirmed the machine results. The idea that the machines could have been so wildly off and yet none of it got caught by any of the post-election reviews is beyond absurd.” On another legal front, some watchdog experts say that the lawyers Lindell has recruited to handle the anti-voting machine litigation could face ethics problems. “Lawyers must abide by the rules of professional conduct, which forbid lying to a court, bringing frivolous claims and misrepresenting facts,” said Michael Teter, the director of Project 65, a bipartisan legal ethics watchdog group focused on lawyers trying to undermine democracy. “Mr Lindell may be willing to pay hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars to these lawyers to continue the effort that began in 2020 to discredit our elections through bogus lawsuits grounded in falsehoods, conjecture and distortions,” Teter added. “But the lawyers who take Mr Lindell’s money and allow the courts to be abused as part of political theater can, and we hope will, face professional consequences.” Lindell’s legal crusade seems aimed at weakening, rather than improving, the election process, concluded Norden of the Brennan Center. “Everything about this [lawsuit] effort wreaks of yet another attempt by the same cast of characters to undermine the election system.”",News/US news,‘I’d like to file lawsuits in all 50 states’: Mike Lindell still pushing Trump’s lie,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/12/mike-lindell-trump-election-big-lie

5/12/2022,"At an age where many of his contemporaries are winding down, the man they call the Grey Kenyan is somehow speeding up. On Sunday Jo Schoonbroodt, a 71-year-old from Maastricht, ran a marathon in a staggering 2hr 54min 19sec to become the fastest septuagenarian in history. A few days later, when the Guardian catches up with him, his achievement is still sinking in. “I only started jogging at 36 because my doctor told me I had high cholesterol,” he says, chuckling. “But last year I ran 7,242 kilometres [4,450 miles], which is more than double what I did in my car.” It also turns out that Schoonbroodt’s new 70+ world record, set at the Maasmarathon of Visé in Belgium, was inspired partly by an unlikely source: the Flemish crooner Eddy Wally. With a few miles remaining, he knew he was just ahead of the previous best, set by Gene Dyckes in 2018, because a friend was following him on his bike and barking out his lap times. But his legs were starting to get heavier. “However, my friend had a special trick to keep me on track,” says Schoonbroodt, who was wearing a yellow and blue kit in support of Ukraine. “He picked up his phone and put Eddy Wally’s song Chérie, Chérie on repeat. I’ve always loved it, I don’t know why. It gave me a boost in morale. I overtook one runner after another and, despite getting cramp in the final 500m, I was able to break the record by four seconds.” Incredibly it was Schoonbroodt’s 75th sub-three-hour marathon, and it came only four weeks after his 74th at the Rotterdam marathon. For good measure, the flying Dutchman also holds a number of ultra running records. He is clearly no ordinary Jo. But the secrets of his success might surprise you. “Most runners train too hard. I do a lot of my training with groups who run very slowly. And then I build on these basics with some faster interval training. But I don’t do the same stupid distance 10 or 20 times – I prefer to have a lot of fun with my running.” Schoonbroodt often runs at nine- or 10-minute mile pace, far slower than the 6:38min miles he ran for 26.2 miles to set his world record, but he says the crucial thing is he listens to his body. “A lot of people follow a training plan or coach and push on even when their body is saying: ‘No, this is not a good day to do it.’ But if you go out the door and just do what you feel, it’s easier to keep running and stay injury-free.” He also dismisses the idea that runners need to do anything special with their diets. “Diet? No, no,” he scoffs. “No diet! I eat double portions, of course, with all these calories I burn. I love pasta and potatoes. But whatever is on the table, I eat it.” He has a similarly relaxed attitude when it comes to alcohol. “I prefer the French wine and the Belgian beer. Not too much, and mostly on weekends. Wine is just a grape drink, so it’s made from nature. And Belgian beer is special. And if you do all this with your body,” he adds, referring to the 85 miles he still runs each week, “you need to give it something back. And this is what I give back to the body!” Schoonbrot is a former IT worker and can tell the exact day he started running – 1 January 1986 – and how many kilometres – 120,000 – he has done since. But he stresses he was no natural. At first people called him Jogger Jo, because he was slow. Nowadays he gets called the Grey Kenyan – a nickname given to him years ago by a race announcer as he blasted past athletes a third of his age. Being a late bloomer, he believes, has actually helped him because his ego never had to worry about chasing faster times of his youth. “Because I started so late, I missed my best years. But that’s no problem. Everything is still new to me.” Schoonbroodt also cites the new range of carbon-plated “super shoes”, which have swept the running world over the past five years, as a key factor. On Sunday he ran in the Asics Metapeed Sky, and has been an ambassador for the Japanese company for the past four years, preaching the positive benefits of exercise to sceptics and lapsed practitioners. But while Schoonbrodt’s achievements are exceptional, he is not the only old master to defy conventional wisdom. Several men older than 70 have run a sub-three-hour marathon – the first of whom, Ed Whitlock, who died in 2017, also ran a 3:15 marathon after turning 80. So what might explain this phenomenon? John Brewer, a sports scientist at the University of the West of Scotland, points out that while we experience a 10% decline in muscle mass every decade as we age, the decline isn’t as sharp for endurance. “The scientific evidence shows that you can maintain your aerobic capacity – your Vo2 max – very effectively into old age,” he says. “And if you look at where we are now compared to 40 years ago, the advances in nutrition, sports science, recovery and technology, all mean that it is more feasible for people in their 60s and 70s to produce good performance if they follow the right training.” Brewer, who was also part of England’s backroom staff for the 1990 World Cup, says Schoonbrodt’s story carries another message – that it is never too late. “People think they can’t turn it around after years of no exercise or poor diets,” he says. “Well, actually you can.” Schoonbroodt, meanwhile, has no plans to put his feet up. “My next marathon is in two and a half weeks, on an old Roman road built 2,000 years ago,” he says, the excitement obvious. It will be his fifth in 2022. And with that he is off. After all, the quest for a 76th sub-three-hour marathon waits for no man. Not even one who is 71.

5/12/2022,"You had only to watch a few minutes of the state opening of parliament to know that, in Britain, an old order is passing. Most comment has focused, naturally enough, on the enforced absence of the Queen, and on Prince Charles deputising for her. But the process of change we are witnessing is not just about individuals, it’s about our governance too. It’s about our politics – and it’s even about the nation itself. The rituals and robes of a state opening appear familiar. But they are an invented tradition from the imperial age, like the building in which they take place. What we saw on Tuesday dates from 1852, during the reign of Queen Victoria, who only intermittently opened parliament herself. Most of the current uniformed flummery was created for Edward VII in 1902. It is important to understand this, because it is a reminder that things do not always have to be this way. It can be tempting to slip into the trap of thinking that Britain’s institutions constitute a settled order. In fact, they are always being changed. If they are not, they find themselves at risk. That is a point that Britain has reached many times in the past, including 1689, 1707, 1832 and 1918, and which it has reached once again in the 2020s. In the monarchy’s case, it is often said that Prince Charles gets this. He is depicted as favouring a slimmed down monarchy. But it is not clear how far he is prepared to go in other respects. Does he intend, as king, to open parliament in full dress admiral’s costume, as he did on Tuesday? Does he still hope to be an activist monarch, as he sees it, or an interfering one, as critics are likely to do? Is he prepared for Commonwealth countries to replace him as head of state? These things will recast Britain’s views of the monarchy too. But these questions are also part of a larger evolution in the way Britain sees itself. Last week’s local elections were understandably seen as a test for Boris Johnson. By that entirely valid yardstick, his Conservatives not only took a pasting but caught a vivid glimpse of worse electoral pastings likely soon to come. Yet the government programme read out this week does little to change that. It reflects a party that cannot agree what it stands for, does not know where its priorities lie and thus has no answer to the increasingly pressing questions about this country’s identity and the way that should be reflected in its institutions. As a result, the UK seems merely to be testing itself, if not to destruction, then certainly to something close to dissolution. This is happening on a daily basis in Scotland, where the SNP tries endlessly to manoeuvre itself into a referendum winning position, and sometimes in Wales too. But it is especially sharply evident in Northern Ireland, where the idea of the United Kingdom has always faced its most severe challenges over the past century. Sinn Féin’s success last Thursday in the Northern Ireland assembly elections was more than a symbolic victory. It was a real one, in political and demographic terms. It is not likely to lead any time soon to one Ireland. But it has reset the old balances. Today, unionism feels, looks and, above all, is in a new and weaker place in Northern Ireland. It needs to take stock and rethink. Yet at just this delicate moment, the Johnson government appears determined to unleash a wheel of fire rolling through Irish and European politics. By ripping up its own Brexit agreement with the EU, the UK does not just antagonise most Irish opinion, the White House and the EU – none of which are great moves during a European war – it also tears up a bit more of its own credibility as a trustworthy signatory of all international trade deals, treaties and conventions. In addition, it throws a phoney lifeline to the most uncompromising strains of unionism just when the DUP’s strategic failure has been dramatically exposed at the ballot box. Instead of using its influence to influence the DUP “to attract rather than antagonise”, as the former Ulster Unionist party official Alex Kane urged this week, the Johnson government is instead giving the DUP a free pass to adopt an intransigent and absolutist stance. The approach will not work on any level, not even in rallying support in the Tory party. It certainly will not win fresh support in Ireland, north or south, except within the DUP. Fintan O’Toole this week called it “a mutually fatal death grip”. Down the line, it is also likely to strengthen support for Scotland to break away from the union. One-nation Conservatism has never seemed more remote than it does today. However, the same is also true of other shared ideas of Britain. We still call ourselves the United Kingdom. But the local elections again exposed a nation state whose union is weakening, whose rival visions are sharper than ever and whose kingdom is even uncertain. David Miliband put it well in a speech last weekend, when he said that a modern idea of Britain remains trapped between “the obsolete and the utopian”. This is a country, Miliband argued, that is badly in need of a new national project of reform. That case will only strengthen as the pressures on the union and the constitution mount up. Yet we are still led, to our shared loss, by a prime minister whose only project is himself.

5/12/2022,"The best, most compelling cricket going on anywhere last weekend wasn’t being played in London or Mumbai, but Hove, where Sussex were taking on Middlesex in the Second Division of the County Championship. There, one of the world’s best young fast bowlers, Shaheen Shah Afridi, was squaring off against one of its best old Test batsmen, Cheteshwar Pujara. The match was in the balance, Sussex were 40 runs ahead and had eight wickets left in their second innings and the two fought over it through that day and into the next. It felt like Championship cricket the way old salts tell you it always used to be back in their playing days. These are good weeks for county cricket, a reminder of the Championship’s strengths at a time when it is being blamed for so many of the English game’s failings, and a rejoinder to those who insist that the competition needs to be entirely reinvented. Sussex did well to sign Pujara while he has a point to prove to the Indian selectors who dropped him from their Test squad. He has scored four centuries in back-to-back matches now, and is racing against Pakistan’s opener Shan Masood, among others, to try to become the first batsman to score 1,000 first-class runs by the end of May since Graeme Hick did it in 1988. It’s a great story, but it is running alongside the Indian Premier League, which, as Graham Gooch once put it, is a bit like a fart competing with thunder. Some of the reports make Pujara sound like a man who has gone off to prove himself by serving on some wild and distant northern border of the sport. He’s not the only one out there. Pujara made a good chunk of his runs in partnership with his new teammate Mohammad Rizwan, who has just been named Wisden’s Twenty20 player of the year. The world’s leading Test batsman, Marnus Labuschagne, is at Glamorgan. His sometime teammates Marcus Harris and Matt Renshaw are trying to force their way back into the Australia side through their performances for Gloucestershire and Somerset respectively. And along with Afridi, Hasan Ali, Haris Rauf, Mohammad Abbas, Mohammad Amir and, until he was injured, Naseem Shah, are all out there terrorising batters. Pakistani quicks have replaced South African all-rounders as the season’s must-have accessory. The common denominator, of course, is that they are all players who did not make it to the IPL. Labuschagne, like Pujara, went unsold in the auction, while the Pakistanis are still shut out of it. But there’s a glimpse here of where the Championship fits into the sport, as a red-ball tournament partly run in parallel with the IPL. And right now, if first-class cricket is your thing, it’s where your attention is drawn too. Especially if you’re English. The overseas players may not have had a choice, but some of the homegrown ones did. Ben Stokes laid down a marker when he decided not to enter the IPL auction because he wanted to make Test cricket his priority. It was interesting to hear that he told Saqib Mahmood that he ought to do the same. The other reason why these early weeks of the Championship have been so interesting is that there are so many English players with something to prove, whether they’re older ones such as Dom Sibley and Rory Burns, who are trying to show they deserve another shot at Test cricket. Or younger ones such as Harry Brook and Tom Haines, making the case that they should get it instead. If you’re English and want to get ahead in Test cricket this season, you need to be playing in the Championship. Which invites the question whether that should go for coaches too. All the talk is that England may need to give one, or both, of the two head coaching roles to men who will want to double it up with their current jobs in the IPL. Brendon McCullum, who is apparently now the favourite for the Test job, has been working as the head coach of the Kolkata Knight Riders (although it’s interesting to see that there are reports that he may have fallen out with either, or both, of the captain and chief executive, so who knows how that will go), and another of the favourites, Gary Kirsten, is with the Gujarat Titans. England’s director of cricket, Rob Key, says it’s better to have the right man for 10 months of the year than the wrong one for 12. Better yet, of course, to get the right man all year round. Or is that really not an option? There’s a lot to like about McCullum, and the idea that he might oversee the sort of revival that he led in New Zealand when he was captain there. But unless he’s going to give up the IPL he needs to persuade English cricket that he will bring so much to the job that it would compensate for the fact that he would be away working in another country, in another format, for a significant stretch of the first-class season. Which is a hard case to make. Because as soon as the team loses the job share will become a problem for him and the England and Wales Cricket Board, in the same way that England’s rugby union head coach Eddie Jones’s (much smaller) consultancy role at Suntory Sungoliath has for English rugby. And understandably so. It would be different in white-ball cricket, where the two jobs might at least be complementary, but right now, it really feels like English Test cricket needs undivided attention.",Sport/Sport,IPL rejects and England hopefuls breathe new life into County Championship | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/12/ipl-rejects-and-england-cricket-hopefuls-breathe-new-life-into-county-championship
5/12/2022,"Ukrainian families could potentially be housed with a host who has failed a DBS check, a council has warned, as the government’s Homes for Ukraine scheme continues to face a range of problems. A DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) check allows employers or other bodies to check the criminal record of someone applying for a role. William Benson, chief executive of Tunbridge Wells borough council, said that if a host failed a DBS check, or their home was deemed unsuitable for the scheme, they would not necessarily be prevented from hosting a Ukrainian refugee as these two processes “run parallel to each other”. He added that refugees were matched to hosts before the DBS check process began. Benson said: “One of the big outstanding issues is that we do not yet know what we do if a host fails a DBS, or a house check. So under what power do we remove someone who has had a pretty traumatic experience coming over here? “There is a potential that a guest is on their way, or has arrived, to be hosted in a house that we don’t believe is suitable.” After a Ukrainian refugee is matched with a host, Kent county council performs the DBS check and Tunbridge Wells borough council performs the check to see whether the house is suitable. But, according to Benson, because they are “separate processes, it is entirely possible that the guests could have had their visa approved and have arrived in a home that we don’t believe is suitable”. Benson has called for more guidance from central government on what to do in such potential cases. Kent county council has also expressed concern regarding the lack of provision made for people coming to the UK through the Ukraine family scheme, which allows applicants to join immediate family members based in the UK, rather than through Homes for Ukraine. “We still retain concern about the operation of the family scheme,” said Roger Gough, the leader of Kent county council. “On one side, regarding the Homes for Ukraine scheme, there is clarity of how it should work, and there is government funding. On the side of those coming via the family route, there is nothing. “And equally, it is also not clear what happens if those relationships break down and people come into the system needing rematching.” According to Gough, there have been instances of family breakdowns and of Ukrainians coming to the UK through the families scheme and later presenting to the council as homeless. In one particular case, a person who occupied a room in a shared house signed up to host four people under the family scheme, who then had to be rehoused due to the unsuitability of the accommodation. Kent has seen about 7,000 households register interest in becoming a host under the Homes for Ukraine scheme and, of these, 1,104 have been matched with Ukrainian refugees so far. The Homes for Ukraine scheme has faced many problems since its launch. Most recently the government had to rehouse hundreds of Ukrainians granted visas because the people they were supposed to stay with had been deemed “unsuitable”. A government spokesperson said: “More than 37,400 people have arrived through both Ukraine schemes and the vast majority of these are settling in well. Very few sponsorships are breaking down. Where they do, councils are able to provide support or find a more suitable sponsor.”",News/UK news,"Ukrainian refugee families could get host who failed DBS check, says council",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/11/ukrainian-refugee-families-could-get-host-who-failed-dbs-check-says-council

5/12/2022,"Britain’s economy contracted in March as consumers cut back on spending in the face of the rising cost of living, the latest official figures show. Activity fell by 0.1% after flatlining in February – an even weaker performance than economic experts had been predicting – with spending in shops suffering particularly badly. Data from the Office for National Statistics showed the economy struggling even before households were hit by higher energy bills and tax increases in April and will increase pressure on Rishi Sunak to ease the inflationary squeeze. Sunak said: “The UK economy recovered quickly from the worst of the pandemic and our growth in the first few months of the year was strong, faster than the US, Germany and Italy, but I know these are still anxious times. “Our recovery is being disrupted by Putin’s barbaric invasion of Ukraine and other global challenges but we are continuing to help people where we can.” Rachel Reeves, Labour’s shadow chancellor said the figures for gross domestic product would increase the public’s worries and urged the chancellor to produce an emergency mini-budget – a call echoed by the British Chambers of Commerce. In March, activity fell by 0.2% in services and production – two of the three main sectors of the economy – with only construction expanding. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, said: “The economy barely kept its head above the water during a volatile start to the year, but times look set to get that bit tougher. “Cost pressures and rising prices have tightened their grip, with both businesses and households feeling the pinch. The end result is a weaker economic outlook.” The ONS said the economy grew by 0.8% in the first three months of 2022 but this was entirely due to a strong performance in January as restrictions to combat the Omicron variant of Covid 19 were eased. Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics. said: “The UK economy grew for the fourth consecutive quarter and is now clearly above pre-pandemic levels, although growth in the latest three months was the lowest for a year. “This was driven by growth in a number of service sectors as the economy continued to recover from Covid-19 effects, including hospitality, transport, employment agencies and travel agencies. There was also strong growth in IT.” “There were, though, some downwards effects from other services, including retailing, wholesaling and car sales and also health, due to continuing decreases in the Test and Trace service and vaccination programmes. “Our latest monthly estimates show GDP fell a little in March, with drops in both services and in production. Construction, though, saw a strong month thanks partly to repair work after the February storms.”",News/Business,UK GDP shrinks in March as consumers cut spending,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/12/uk-gdp-shrinks-in-march-as-consumers-cut-spending
