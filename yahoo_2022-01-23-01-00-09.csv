1/23/2022,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government on Saturday distanced itself from comments made by its navy chief after video footage emerged in which the vice-admiral said Russian President Vladimir Putin deserved respect and that Kyiv would never win back annexed Crimea from Moscow. German Navy Chief Kay-Achim Schoenbach apologized for his ""rash"" comments, published on YouTube and widely circulated on German media, and called them a mistake. In a Twitter post, Schoenbach said his remarks at a thinktank discussion in India expressed a personal opinion and not the official position of the defence ministry. The remarks come at a sensitive time as Russia has amassed tens of thousand of troops on Ukraine's borders and diplomatic efforts are ongoing to prevent the situation from escalating into war. Russia denies it is planning to invade Ukraine. A spokesperson for the Defence Ministry in Berlin said the remarks did not reflect Germany's position in either content or wording. ""Admiral Schoenbach will get the opportunity to express his views to the chief of defence,"" the spokesperson added. In the video, Schoenbach, speaking in English, says Putin seeks to be treated at eye level by the West. ""What he (Putin) really wants is respect,"" Schoenbach says. ""And my God, giving someone respect is low cost, even no cost... It is easy to give him the respect he really demands - and probably also deserves,"" Schoenbach said, calling Russia an old and important country. Schoenbach concedes Russia's actions in Ukraine needed to be addressed, but adds that ""the Crimea peninsula is gone, it will never come back, this is a fact"", thereby contradicting the joint Western position that Moscow's annexation of the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 cannot be accepted and must be reversed. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry called on Germany to publicly reject the navy chief's comments. Schoenbach's comments that Crimea would never return to Ukraine and that Russia's president deserved respect could impair Western efforts to de-escalate the situation, it said in a statement. ""Ukraine is grateful to Germany for the support it has already provided since 2014, as well as for the diplomatic efforts to resolve the Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict. But Germany's current statements are disappointing and run counter to that support and effort,"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said separately in tweet.

1/23/2022,"A Florida teenager is accused of tracking the movements of a man who regularly jogged past his home with the intention of killing him and keeping his corpse in his closet “to play with.” Logan Smith, 18, was arrested on Monday and charged with one count of attempted murder in connection with the failed strangling of the victim near Smith's Cocoa home, according to an arrest report from the Brevard County Sheriff's Office, obtained by Orlando outlet WOFL reports. One week before his arrest, Smith had allegedly collected an arsenal of so-called weapons from his home: an aerosol Axe deodorant can, a rubber mallet and the belt of a robe before lying in wait for the victim. ""The defendant walked directly across his street where he hid behind a light pole,” the arrest report states. “He placed the mallet and the Axe aerosol on the ground next to him while he waited for the [victim] to come running down the street as he did regularly for exercise. The defendant waited for the victim to run past the light pole and proceeded to run after him.The defendant then tossed the clothing robe belt over the victim's head until it was around the front area of the victim's neck."" However, the victim was able to overpower Smith with martial arts, according to investigators. In a post-attack interview, Smith allegedly told investigators that he had been monitoring the victim’s routine for about six weeks. He allegedly claimed he finally decided to kill him after watching “Scream,” Fox 35 in Orlando reports. Investigators say that Smith intended to use the Axe spray in the jogger’s eyes as a way to disable him. ""He further planned to place the victim's body into his closet where the defendant stated no one would know, and the defendant could have the victim's body all to himself,” the arrest report states. “The defendant stated that he also planned to play with the victim to fulfill his sexual fantasies.” Smith is being held without bond. It’s not clear if he has an attorney. ""We just thought it was odd that he wanted to go out to the movies by himself,” the boyfriend of Smith’s mom told Fox 35. “A person like Logan is more of a loner.”  The father figure, who has not been identified, described Logan as such: “He wouldn’t have been the kid you invited to the cool parties.” The Brevard County Sheriff's Office has not responded to Oxygen.com’s request for documents or comment.",U.S./Oxygen,Teen Accused Of Trying To Kill Jogger So He Could Keep His Body 'To Play With',https://news.yahoo.com/teen-accused-trying-kill-jogger-150900273.html
