5/18/2022,"The fact that a Conservative MP has been arrested on suspicion of rape and other offences and ordered to stay way from Westminster but has not been identified is the product of several legal and procedural factors. The Metropolitan police have not named him because, in line with College of Policing guidance, they do not usually identify people who have been arrested before they are charged. The reason why newspapers are also not naming him is more complex and is connected to a mixture of convention and legal precedent going back to the 2012 Leveson report on media standards, which recommended suspects remain anonymous pre-charge. While many newspapers disagreed with this as a policy, a complication came with the legal case the singer Cliff Richard won against the BBC after the corporation reported he was being investigated over allegations of historical child sexual assault, for which he was never arrested or charged. The ruling was seen as limiting the freedom of media organisations to report such investigations, despite the fact that particularly with historical cases, this can prompt more potential victims to come forward. In another legal decision in February this year the supreme court ruled against the news agency Bloomberg for naming a US business executive at a large public company who was facing a criminal inquiry by a British regulator. The businessman said Bloomberg had misused private information as he had not been charged with any offence. Another potential complication is that among the allegations faced by the MP is abuse of position of trust, an offence connected to children aged under 18. If naming the MP could risk revealing the identity of an alleged victim this would also be a major barrier. In the past, MPs who were arrested were automatically named by parliamentary authorities. This changed in 2016 after the cross-party procedure committee said this could bring privacy issues. Now, MPs are consulted, and named only if there is a reason of “parliamentary privilege or constitutional significance”. At the time, the committee argued this did not provide any special privilege for MPs, but simply brought their treatment into line with that of anyone else.",News/UK news,Why is Tory MP arrested on suspicion of rape not being named?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/18/why-tory-mp-arrested-suspicion-rape-not-being-named
5/18/2022,"Two litter pickers unwittingly drove half a mile home with a live first world war bomb in the car as their weekly good deed turned into a scene from a Hollywood thriller. Rachel Wills and Simon Briscombe thought they had found an old gas canister while they were collecting rubbish from the River Nidd in Knaresborough, North Yorkshire, on Monday. They drove half a mile home, jolting over speed bumps, as the muddy item bounced around on a car seat next to them. It was only when they “scraped the gunk” off, they said, that they realised they had found an explosive – prompting a rather frantic call to the bomb squad. There was then a nail-biting wait for the emergency services. “It was frothing, the shell was bubbling. It was strange and frightening,” Wills said. The emergency services evacuated the couple’s home along with about 30 others on the estate. A 100-metre cordon was put in place while an army explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) team attended to retrieve the device for it to be detonated safely. Wills said it was the first time the army had been called out to deal with the couple’s weekly litter picks. “We’ve found some really strange things, including a sewing machine from 1898, trolleys, money, shoes, all sorts,” she said. “But I can’t believe we found what we found and it was live. We had it in our car, a live bomb, and we were driving over speed bumps too.” She said she thought recent floods had dislodged the bomb and brought it to the surface, and it was “so lucky children didn’t find it”. The incident led to the closure of the busy A59 for two hours, and police have since thanked the public for remaining calm while the device was dealt with. Wills, a cafe owner, said she had been “tired, shocked and teary” since seeing the bomb explode, adding: “We had a narrow escape.” She told the BBC: “Imagine if children had found it, picked it up and thrown it about. It’s unthinkable.” Police said anyone who finds what could be a bomb should leave it in place without touching it, move 50 metres away and contact 101. North Yorkshire police said: “Thankfully, the EOD were able to dispose of the object, and the incident was brought to a safe conclusion. Thank you to residents in the local area for their patience whilst we dealt with the incident.”",News/UK news,First world war bomb survives bumpy ride in Yorkshire litter pickers’ car,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/18/first-world-war-bomb-survives-bumpy-ride-in-yorkshire-litter-pickers-car
5/18/2022,"The French government is to challenge a town council decision to allow bathers to wear the burkini – a full-body swimsuit – in its pools. The interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, said the move was an “unacceptable provocation” that was against the values of the secular republic and announced he would seek to block it. Grenoble town council’s decision to loosen the strict rules of swimwear to allow people to dress “how they like” at outdoor municipal pools, including wearing burkinis or swimming topless, has reopened the contentious debate over the place of religious symbols and clothing in France just weeks from a legislative election. Critics see the body covering garment as a symbol of creeping Islamism and an attack on France’s secular tradition while some feminists would like a complete ban on it, seeing the garment as a symbol of female oppression. Until now, it has been banned in public pools, along with baggy swim shorts and T-shirts, for reasons of hygiene. The current rules require male bathers to wear tight-fitting trunks. Grenoble’s decision to allow the wearing of burkinis provoked an angry response from opponents. The regional authority announced it was immediately suspending public funding to the town and an investigation has been launched by the public prosecutor into an organisation behind the move. Laurent Wauquiez, of the centre-right Les Républicains party and president of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes regional authority, said Grenoble had “broken with secularism and the values of our Republic” and engaged in a form of “separatism”. He had accused the local mayor, the Ecology-Green representative Éric Piolle of “doing deals with political Islam … to buy votes”. Piolle faced fierce opposition against the move and won the swimwear vote by a slim 29 votes to 27, with two abstentions after a fiery debate that lasted almost four hours. Piolle said he was delighted to be attacked by Darmanin, and said the decision was a “feminist one”. “All we want is for women and men to be able to dress how they wish,” Piolle told RMC radio afterwards. Grenoble is not the first to allow bathers to wear burkinis in municipal pools; in 2019, Rennes in north-west France loosened its dress code to allow the full-body swimsuit and other types of swimwear. In 2016, attempts by several mayors to ban the burkini from beaches in the Mediterranean caused a national row and were eventually ruled to be discriminatory. France’s 1905 law on laïcité – which roughly translates as “secularism” – allows the wearing of religious symbols in public places, including swimming pools as long as they do not impinge on hygiene and safety. Muslim female footballers in France are currently engaged in a legal battle to overturn French Football Federation rules that prevent them wearing the hijab. The FFF bans all “ostentatious” religious symbols including the Jewish kippa for competition matches. On Tuesday, the Grenoble public prosecutor opened an investigation into Alliance Citoyenne, the organisation that campaigned for the burkini after allegations that it had illegally “collected and kept” personal information on people’s ethnic origins as well as their political and religious beliefs. The gathering of such information is strictly prohibited in France. The local prefect, the state representative, is also to contest the decision to change the pool dress rules in the administrative court, claiming it contravenes both the 1905 law and legislation passed last August to combat religious “separatism”.",News/World news,France to challenge Grenoble’s move to allow burkinis in public pools,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/18/france-to-challenge-grenobles-move-to-allow-burkini-in-public-pools
5/18/2022,"A coffee bar in Florence has been fined €1,000 (£846) after a customer got steamed up over the price of a humble cup of espresso. The customer called police after being charged €2 (£1.7) for his coffee – a decaffeinated one, at that – at Ditta Artigianale in the centre of the Tuscan city. The man complained that the price was not displayed on a menu behind the counter. It was this error that landed the bar, which is celebrated for its coffee-making and has won winning several competitions, in trouble. Francesco Sanapo, the owner of Ditta Artigianale, vented about the fine on social media and defended his coffee, which he said comes from a small plantation in Mexico and “is prepared with great care by my baristas”. He argued that the price of the coffee was displayed on a digital menu. “They fined me because somebody got offended for paying €2 for a decaffeinated coffee [which involves a water extraction process]. Can you believe it?” Sanapo said in a video while holding up a letter from the police. “Even today, someone can get so annoyed that they mobilise the police, who find us to be in the wrong due to an outdated law. This law must be changed because otherwise 99.9% of bars and restaurants would easily fall foul of it.” In Italy, the average cost of an espresso is €1, although more than 70% of bars increased prices earlier in the year due to supply chain issues and poor harvests. Consumer groups warned that the price of an espresso could rise to an average €1.50 this year. Sanapo said that Ditta Artigianale – described on Facebook as the “first Italian coffee bar dedicated to quality coffee” – was somewhat “revolutionary” when it charged €1.50 for an espresso when the bar first opened in 2013. “There was negative and positive reaction, but until now I had never been fined,” he said. “Nobody should be scandalised about paying €2 for an espresso any more,” he added, citing the rise in cost of raw materials. The Florence branch of Confartigianato, an association for small businesses, defended the bar. “This is something that deeply embitters me,” its president, Alessandro Vittorio Sorani, said. “A great deal of work goes into producing a quality product. Quality pays off and benefits everyone.” Some of the bar’s customers leapt to its defence too. “If this customer went to London he’d get the FBI involved,” one wrote on Facebook.",News/World news,Florence coffee bar customer calls police over price of espresso,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/18/florence-coffee-bar-customer-calls-police-over-price-of-espresso
5/18/2022,"Here is a strong pair of documentaries being shown together at the Bertha Dochouse in London; they are ostensibly mirror images of each other: a female trio and a male trio, urban Hungary and rural Bosnia, chatty and taciturn. But both Divas (★★★★☆) and Brotherhood (★★★★☆) are powerfully characterised works about young people that tunnel inside their milieus to broach questions of growing up and assuming personal responsibility. Only six years older than the three 20-year-olds he encounters on the windowsill of a Budapest school that gives expelled students a last chance to get a diploma, director Máté Körösi seems self-conscious about following around the young women dubbed “the divas” by their classmates. Preened to the max, the group comprises new-agey, dreadlocked Tina, trucker-mouthed karaoke hostess Szani and the Bowie-coiffed, depressive Emese. Körösi appears fascinated by their sass and frivolity, but admits that, by studying them, he is looking to understand his own case of arrested development. In fact, behind their immaculate facade, they are black belts in personal development. Either from broken homes or with troubled psyches, the trio’s snarky attitude flows directly from the life force that has kept them alive and evolving, and their friendship is a safety capsule. Enduring their teasing, Körösi keeps things fresh with a lively array of visual tricks: video diaries, superimposed illustrations and a lovely tracking shot that recalls the Donnie Darko high-school entrance. And in gaining their confidences – and being stunned into sudden wisdom by one final tragic event – he ends up being the one who perhaps benefits the most in this touching, liberating film. The Qur’an is the road to personal development in Italian director Francesco Montagner’s film about a Bosnian shepherd family … or is it? When patriarch Ibrahim is jailed for two years for travelling to Syria, his three sons quickly drift away from their assigned roles. The eldest, Jabir, with a ginger rockabilly kiss-curl, hits the nightclubs. The youngest, Useir – earmarked as a future imam – prefers gaming on his smartphone to religious instruction. Even the middle child Usama, saddled with the sheep and a theological stickler like his father, has an angry, bullying streak that suggests he could err from the path. Jabir would like to start his own business, Useir has future YouTube streamer all over him – but Usama clings to resignation. “Everyone’s destiny is written down. It’s mine to herd sheep,” he says. Montagner often scrutinises the brothers’ faces in extreme closeup, lending Brotherhood’s spiritual showdown – traditionalist fatalism v 21st-century individualism – an epic quality; he further emphasises these contours with what appear to be overtly dramatised scenes. But he retains the mystery, and it’s never clear which force triumphs. If modernity seems to have the upper hand, then the timeless gloaming of the Balkan hillsides is its own reply.

5/18/2022,"A cloud of Saharan dust could create a “blood rain” effect across the UK later this week, as it turns the rain from thunderstorms a shade of red, forecasters have predicted. “Blood rain” occurs when high concentrations of red-coloured dust or particles combine with rain, giving it a red appearance as it falls, according to the Met Office. The red or orange rain is expected in some parts of the UK after moving across Europe, alongside heavy downpours, lightning, strong winds, and hail. The dust cloud, which originated in the Sahara, was last seen in the UK in March – causing the skies to turn temporarily orange. A yellow thunderstorm warning has also been issued by the Met Office, lasting from Wednesday evening to the early hours of Thursday in south-east England, including London, with potential disruption to travel. The weather warning comes after the hottest day of the year so far on Tuesday, as temperatures in the south-east peaked at 27.5C. Richard Miles, from the Met Office, said: “There are some dust concentrations in the atmosphere above the UK at present which might well be washed out in the rain tonight, but it’s likely to be relatively small amounts on the whole. “There’s a warning out for thunderstorms for the south-eastern third of England tonight, and a squally cold front will bring wind and sometimes heavy rain to Northern Ireland and north-west Scotland this evening. “Away from these features it will be mostly fine and dry on Wednesday and tomorrow, temperatures up to 23-24C in London and the south-east, high teens or low 20s elsewhere.” The expected thunderstorms may cause spray and flooding, leading to difficult driving conditions and some road closures. There may also be delays or cancellations to train and bus services, flooding to homes and businesses, power cuts and damage due to lightning strikes. Heavy rain is expected to fall on Wednesday and Thursday in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, while showers will also affect areas in Wales and central and south-west England.",News/UK news,‘Blood rain’ Saharan dust cloud headed for UK,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/18/blood-rain-saharan-dust-cloud-uk

Previously the Campaign Publishing Awards, the British Media Awards reward and celebrate excellence across editorial, content curation, commercial success and strategic innovation, as well as the people and businesses behind the work. The Guardian won ‘Commercial Campaign of the Year’ for Feasting with Ocado Retail. Feasting with Ocado Retail was a ground-breaking shoppable experience that saw Ocado own all the ad inventory in the Guardian’s acclaimed Saturday food magazine Feast (print and online), with recipes carrying unique QR codes to enable readers to shop for ingredients directly from the page to the website. Judges praised the shoppable component via QR codes, saying it drove impressive mid-funnel results. The Guardian also won the award for ‘Podcast of the Year – Branded Content’ for Comfort Eating with Grace Dent, supported by Ocado. Judges praised the podcast for its authenticity, its content, the smart execution and the strong results. Comfort Eating was number one in the podcast charts for three weeks and in Ocado’s first shop survey, 25% of respondents said they had listened to the podcast. Series three of Comfort Eating with Grace Dent launched earlier this week, with guest James May. Imogen Fox, director of advertising, Guardian News & Media said: “The Guardian’s partnership with Ocado is advertising at its best, it is innovative, creative and the results show that advertising with us really works.

5/18/2022,"Any Russian moves to prosecute and potentially execute some of the hundreds of Ukrainian fighters who surrendered in Mariupol could be in breach of the Geneva conventions, which state that prisoners of war should not be punished for having taken part in hostilities. The concerns were underlined by the UK’s armed forces minister, James Heappey,who told the radio station LBC: “I think there have been enough atrocities in this war already without seeing the execution or whatever of the prisoners of war, which I fear this is a prelude to. I just think we have to be very clear, that sort of atrocity the west would stand in utter condemnation of. Prisoners of war have a status enshrined in the Geneva convention.” Among those who have called for the prosecution of the fighters who have been leaving the sprawling Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol is the pro-Russia Donetsk separatist leader Denis Pushilin, who said on Wednesday that a court would decide their fate. The Geneva conventions comprise four treaties and three protocols establishing international legal standards for humanitarian treatment during wars. The single term Geneva convention usually refers to the agreements negotiated in 1949 after the second world war. The 1949 convention says PoWs must not be prosecuted for their direct part in hostilities, and makes clear that detention after capture should not be seen as a form of punishment but a means to prevent further participation in the conflict. The only permissible exception is that the detaining power may prosecute prisoners for possible war crimes. One of Russia’s claimed justifications for its war of aggression against Ukraine was that members of the Azov regiment in Mariupol were responsible for war crimes. Early on in the battle for the port city, the Russian defence spokesperson Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov claimed: “It was these Azov battalion Nazis who had been exterminating civilian population in Donetsk and Luhansk republics, deliberately and with exceptional cruelty, for eight years.” Concern over the potential fate of some of the Ukrainian soldiers has been raised after threats by Russian officials to treat them as “terrorists” rather than combatants. Although Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, promised that the fighters who surrendered would be treated “in accordance with international standards”, this was immediately undermined by statements from other Russian officials. “Nazi criminals should not be exchanged,” said Vyacheslav Volodin, the chair of the State Duma, in a speech on Tuesday, referring to Ukrainian offers of a prisoner exchange. “Our country treats those who surrendered or were captured humanely. But with regards to Nazis, our position should be unchanged: these are war criminals and we must do everything so that they stand trial.” Russia’s justice ministry appealed to the supreme court to declare the Azov regiment a terrorist organisation on Tuesday, possibly introducing another hurdle to a potential exchange. Azov has been a key part of the Russian propaganda narrative about the war in Ukraine, which was originally launched with the supposed goal of “denazification”. It was formed in 2014 as a volunteer militia to fight Russia-backed forces in east Ukraine, and many of its original members had far-right extremist views. Since then, the unit has been integrated into the Ukrainian national guard and its commanders say it has moved away from its far-right origins. Both sides in the conflict have been accused of breaches of the Geneva conventions in their treatment of prisoners. Matilda Bogner, the head of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine, said there was “credible information” of mistreatment of prisoners. “We have received credible information of torture, ill-treatment and incommunicado detention by Ukrainian armed forces of prisoners of war belonging to the Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups,” Bogner said. Soldiers were “being coerced to make statements, apologies and confessions, and [subjected to] other forms of humiliation,” she said.",News/World news,Russian prosecutions of Azov fighters could breach Geneva conventions,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/18/russian-prosecutions-azov-fighters-geneva-conventions-ukraine
5/18/2022,"Bullies sneak in at the sidelines of this story, but Melissa Johns doesn’t let them steal the show. In her one-woman performance, the extremely affable Coronation Street actor centres sharp and funny stories about sex and dating. Snatched may not be the most rigorous piece of storytelling, but it charmingly articulates how she learned to enjoy her body after she had gone to desperate measures to hide it. Johns acts out a fractured collection of mini-scenes and memories, primarily about navigating an ableist world as a woman with one and a half arms. Individually, the snippets are witty and honest, but the lack of an overarching structure makes the show feel untidy, like you’re flipping through a diary, randomly stopping every so often to read an entry. As Johns recounts her teenage years, musician Imogen Halsey orchestrates her 00s playlist. Halsey’s voice is gorgeous but feels a little wasted, her live performance strangely in conflict with the digital audio. Using one or the other would make the show feel more cohesive. Snatched comes into clearest detail when Johns recalls the distressing experience of having her naked photos leaked online. On top of the ridiculous shame she was made to feel for having taken the pictures, she faced horrific comments from trolls about her disability. It’s clear how much these comments have crawled under her skin; she doesn’t read them out loud, instead choosing to project them on the screen behind her. At the start of the show, Johns presents a mock awards ceremony, an ironic celebration of patronising prizes she’s been given for being such a quote unquote inspiration. Swanning around in a glitzy gown, she’s so certain, so glamorous. She exudes total confidence.

5/18/2022,"If you don’t like the idea of joining an entire audience mimicking John Travolta’s nasal “Naahhh-iiights” at the end of the Grease Megamix (or you don’t know what the Grease Megamix is), this musical is probably not for you. Grease is an exercise in nostalgia, whether that was the original 1971 musical harking back to the 1950s, or current audiences revelling in memories of Travolta and Olivia Newton-John. Sandy’s transformation might be Grease’s most iconic moment, but change isn’t really what this show is about – its world of unreconstructed sexism, innumerable pelvic thrusts and a heroine who only gains currency when she dons tight leather trousers is not being reinvented for the 21st century. Nonetheless, Nikolai Foster’s production is brightly entertaining and blasts out room-filling energy in its big dance numbers by choreographer Arlene Phillips, with tight formations of sharp, rhythmic 50s motifs. The cast sing the film’s theme song like a manifesto, full of rebellion and disaffection, and this version does draw on Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey’s grittier 1971 script and score. Some of those songs are forgettable, but Danny’s How Big I’m Gonna Be offers a glimmer of self-awareness after all his cool-kid posturing. Mooning, a sweet falling-in-love between two minor characters, showcases the soaring falsetto of Noah Harrison. Star casting comes in the shape and soft pop voice of Peter Andre, who plays DJ Vince Fontaine minus the sleaze. Jocasta Almgill’s Rizzo has bite, presence and ultimately depth – she’s the real female lead – but there’s little draw in the central love story as Danny and Sandy barely have anything to do with each other. Individually, Olivia Moore as Sandy delivers a show-stopping Hopelessly Devoted to You, and Dan Partridge’s Danny nails that jumpy swagger that Travolta did so well, like an overexcited puppy pretending to be a big dog. If there’s a theme here, it’s the desperation of these tough kids from the wrong side of Chicago’s tracks to appear invulnerable. The donning of protective attitude; safety in the clique.

5/18/2022,"Welcome to The Spin, the Guardian’s weekly (and free) cricket newsletter. Here’s an extract from this week’s edition. To receive the full version every Wednesday, just pop your email in below. Brendon McCullum’s accession to the English men’s Test cricket throne comes with mixed emotions from a New Zealand perspective. On the one hand McCullum’s anointment is an inspiring south-Dunedin-boy-made-good story; a doff of the cap to the New Zealand cricket revolution he led as captain from 2012 until 2016, before ceding the reins to Kane Williamson. The juxtaposition, however, involves McCullum starting his four-year tenure, which is expected to earn him £2m, against the Black Caps at Lord’s on 2 June in the first of three Tests against his countrymen. Such a paradigm shift evokes a level of awkwardness one might expect to confront from an ex turning up to Christmas dinner. For the Black Caps, McCullum’s immediate promotion sours the toast. Six years after his international retirement, any form of lingering loyalty to his country, to those former teammates he captained with such distinction – Williamson, Tim Southee, Trent Boult, Tom Latham, Henry Nicholls, Neil Wagner among them – has been swatted to the boundary. The innate knowledge McCullum boasts on those influential senior figures, many of whom helped guide New Zealand to the inaugural World Test Championship triumph last June, will now be used to plot their downfall. The Black Caps are unlikely to ever admit as much publicly, but there could be the odd uncomfortable glance as McCullum sings God Save the Queen and tucks into the glazed lamb cutlets at lunch on day one. There is an intense curiosity that McCullum has never expressed an open desire to coach New Zealand yet he will now lead one of the most powerful cricket nations, despite having no red-ball coaching experience. While his brash batting and astute, courageous captaincy was widely lauded, McCullum’s coaching claims amount to a Caribbean Premier League Twenty20 title with Trinbago, and taking Kolkata to the Indian Premier League final last year. Compared to other sports cricket forms a unique dynamic in that the captain, in many of the most successful teams at least, is part coach, too. McCullum is often credited for resurrecting the Black Caps’ fortunes after the nadir of 2 January 2013 in Cape Town after South Africa dismissed New Zealand for 45 in his first Test as captain. He did so alongside the Black Caps coach, and close confidant, Mike Hesson. Hesson and McCullum’s lockstep partnership is, essentially, the coach-captain relationship England hope to replicate with the Christchurch-born Ben Stokes. In many ways, though, Hesson was the yin to McCullum’s yang. Stokes and McCullum are similar characters in that both are cut from the same ultra-competitive cloth. Both would rather take the leap of faith, to adopt an aggressive approach in search of victory, than settle for a face-saving draw. It is that high-risk, high-reward attitude that propelled McCullum to becoming the first New Zealand captain to lead his team to a World Cup final, only to elect to bat first and be dismissed for a three-ball duck by Mitchell Starc at the Melbourne Cricket Ground after attempting to hit the two previous deliveries to the fence. In his heart of hearts McCullum is a gambler – the antithesis to his rival for the England Test job, the South African Gary Kirsten. McCullum’s modus operandi will be to relieve England’s best cricketers of the weight of expectation, anxiety and pressure and empower them to embrace the free-spirited attitude from their formative years. Speaking at the prestigious 2016 MCC Cowdrey lecture, McCullum offered a poignant insight into the approach with which he will implore England to grasp. “The outcome of the ‘uncaring’, no-consequence play was a revelation to me,” he said. “I suspect it was something I had been trying to achieve on a personal level for years, but I had been unable to do so, except for fleeting moments. Here there was a release of many of the external factors that can creep in and influence a player. There was an instinctiveness that took over – no fear of failure, just playing and being ‘in the moment’.” Bottom of the world championship standings with one win from their past 17 Tests and sixth in the Test rankings, England need a saviour. Their 4-0 Ashes capitulation spoke to a side devoid of nerve and in desperate need of evolution. Hesson is confident McCullum will brush aside the doubters to defy his dearth of Test coaching experience, although he cautions against expecting instant miracles. “It’s a pretty good fit in terms of what the England Test team needs. I was delighted for him,” Hesson told Newstalk ZB last weekend. “I’m pleased he’s got a four-year term because at least he and the administrators have understood it’s not a short-term fix. “When you’ve played over 100 Test matches and captained a number of those you have a heck of a knowledge in the bank there. He’s also got a number of guys in that dressing room who have played over 100 Test matches as well. “He’s been through the emotions of Test cricket and different styles with how he’s gone about things and worked out a really successful method. Those last 25-30 Tests he was exceptional. “I think he’ll do very well. There will be a good vibe in the group with a fresh feel and once Brendon gets his teeth into things, he’ll make the necessary changes he needs to in the coming years.” When McCullum walks into the home dressing room at Lord’s next month his eyes will be open to the challenge before him, knowing the honeymoon phase won’t last. Yet if his surprise Test coaching career is anything like his playing days, strap in for the ride. “In life if you’re going to change what you’re doing, then make sure it’s worth the risk of doing so,” McCullum told SEN Radio on Friday. “This is a big enough challenge to risk that, that’s for sure.” Liam Napier is the chief sports writer of the New Zealand Herald",Sport/Sport,"The Spin | In New Zealand, McCullum’s England role provokes mixed emotions",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/18/new-zealand-reaction-brendon-mccullum-england-test-cricket-role-the-spin
5/18/2022,"Paintings by three titans of modern art have sold for a total of almost $166m (£134m) at auction, confirming the buoyancy of the global market. In a sale of modern art at Sotheby’s in New York on Tuesday evening, a total of more than $408m was paid for works by artists including Picasso, Monet, Cézanne, Gauguin, Magritte, Dalí and Renoir. Ten works sold for more than $10m each in an auction broadcast live on Instagram, attracting nearly 20,000 viewers. Pablo Picasso’s Femme nue Couchée, a sensuous depiction of the artist’s muse and lover, Marie-Thérèse Walter, as a multi-limbed sea creature, went for $67.5m. It was one of the highest prices ever achieved for a portrait of Walter, whose relationship with Picasso began when she was 17. Brooke Lampley, the chair and head of global fine art sales at Sotheby’s, said the 1932 painting was “a deeply lyrical ode to the artist’s unbound desire for Marie-Thérèse; with her fin-like, endlessly pliable limbs, the portrait continues to enchant as it perfectly captures Picasso’s muse as the ultimate expression of his genius”. A further six works by Picasso were sold at the auction, including L’Étreinte, which depicts a man and a woman embracing in a bedroom, which went for $14.1m. Claude Monet’s Le Grand Canal et Santa Maria della Salute, completed in 1908, became the most valuable view of Venice by the artist sold at auction when it fetched $56.6m. Another Monet, Les Arceaux de Roses, Giverny, sold for $23.3m. After the auction, Lampley said: “The two titans of modern art – Pablo Picasso and Claude Monet – squared off tonight as the standard-bearers for the market … Both works showcased the artists at the height of their powers, with each representing a distinct moment of transformation that would play a pivotal role in defining their respective careers.” Paul Cézanne’s Clairière (the Glade), which fetched $41.7m, was one of three classical impressionist paintings sold by the Toledo Museum of Art to establish an endowment to fund art acquisitions. The others were Pierre-Auguste Renoir’s Nu s’essuyant and Henri Matisse’s Fleurs ou Fleurs Devant un Portrait. A third of the works in the sale had not been offered at auction for at least 20 years. Sotheby’s said collectors in Asia were active in bidding, a hallmark of recent high-profile auctions. Helena Newman, Sotheby’s worldwide head of impressionist and modern art, said the total sales from the auction – the third most valuable in the auction house’s history – were “testament to the enduring demand for classic impressionist and modern works from our global collectors. “We saw strong prices across the board for works by the giants of modern art, from Monet and Cézanne through to Modigliani, Matisse, Picasso, Giacometti and de Kooning – a testament to the continued stature of this artistic period in the international market.” This week, the second auction of modern and contemporary works from the collection of Harry and Linda Macklowe realised a total of $246.1m. The sale was ordered by a judge as part of the couple’s acrimonious divorce settlement. The first tranche, which went under the hammer last November, sold for $676m, bringing the total for the collection to more than $922m.",Arts/Art and design,Picasso painting of his lover as a sea creature sells for $67.5m at New York auction,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/18/picasso-painting-of-his-lover-as-a-sea-creature-sells-for-675m-at-new-york-auction
