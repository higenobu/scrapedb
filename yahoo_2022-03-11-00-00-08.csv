3/11/2022,"A Black Dunkin’ Donuts employee based in Tampa, Florida had confronted an angry customer who was using racial slurs toward him, resulting in a fatal punch to the customer. The employee, Corey Pujols, has pleaded guilty to felony battery and has been sentenced to two years of house arrest, reported CBS News.
 Vonelle Cook, 77, was reportedly a regular at this particular Dunkin’ store. According to the court records obtained by NBC, Cook went to order a coffee in the drive-thru and he began berating the employees for poor service after they said they were having trouble hearing him.

Toasted: Jerk Chicken Empanadas and Mango Chili Sauce From NBC: He was asked to leave, but he parked his car and went inside the store. When Cook appeared inside the store, Pujols asked a coworker to call police. Prosecutors said Cook began arguing with Pujols. Once Cook said the racial slur, Pujols walked around the counter and told him not to say that again. When he repeated it, Pujols hit him in the jaw and Cook fell to the floor. An autopsy said he suffered a skull fracture and brain contusions. Cook died three days later from his injuries, as reported by CBS. Pujols was originally charged with manslaughter however, prosecutors found Pujols did not have intentions of killing Cook considering his youth and lack of a criminal record. “Two of the primary factors were the aggressive approach the victim took toward the defendant and everyone working with the defendant, and that the victim repeatedly used possibly the most aggressive and offensive term in the English language,” said Grayson Kamm, a spokesperson for Hillsborough State Attorney Andrew Warren, via Tampa Bay Times. A Tampa judge sentenced Corey Pujols to two years of house arrest and ordered 200 hours of community service and an anger management course.",U.S./The Root,"Dunkin’ Employee Fatally Punches Man who Used Racial Slur, Charged and Sentenced",https://news.yahoo.com/dunkin-employee-fatally-punches-man-155759470.html

3/11/2022,"WASHINGTON — U.S. intelligence leaders on Tuesday floated the idea that Vladimir Putin may seek an exit from Ukraine if his war effort continues to stall, but that escalation of the conflict is likely to happen before the Russian president considers ending his attacks. “We assess Putin feels aggrieved the West does not give him proper deference and perceives this as a war he cannot afford to lose. But what he might be willing to accept as a victory may change over time, given the significant costs he is incurring,” Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence, told members of the House Intelligence Committee. The heads of the nation’s intelligence agencies painted a bleak picture of the war as it winds through its second week. Intelligence agencies expect that food and water for some Ukrainians could run out in less than two weeks, and believe that between 2,000 and 4,000 Russian troops have died so far. Although Russia possesses a military arsenal superior to Ukraine in almost every respect, the Kremlin has performed much worse than predicted and has so far failed to take any of the country’s biggest cities. CIA Director William Burns, a former ambassador to Moscow, warned Tuesday that Putin now finds himself in an untenable position. ""I think Putin is angry and frustrated right now. He's likely to double down and try to grind down the Ukrainian military with no regard for civilian casualties,” Burns said of Russia’s efforts, which have already resulted in an estimated 2 million Ukrainian refugees. “But the challenge that he faces — and this is the biggest question that's hung over our analysis of his planning for months now … he has no sustainable political endgame in the face of what is going to continue to be fierce resistance from Ukrainians,” Burns continued. “So I think that's what his calculus has been. And I think that's the reality of what he faces today."" The intelligence leaders also said they are keeping close tabs on Putin’s “saber-rattling,” in which the Russian autocrat has reminded the world of his nuclear arsenal. “I believe that when he says something, we should listen very, very carefully and take him at his word,” said Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. As the debate has raged in Washington about what role the U.S. should play in the conflict, lawmakers across the aisle have debated what it would take for Putin to end the invasion — or whether Russia is likely to be bogged down in Ukraine as an occupying force. “It’s very hard to figure out what’s the off-ramp,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said after the hearing. “What we can continue to do is continue to escalate the price that he and Russia have to pay for this.” The West is continuing to increase its pressure on Russia to exit Ukraine. President Biden announced Tuesday that the U.S. would stop importing oil from Russia, and an ever-growing list of U.S. and international companies have suspended their business in Russia. “One thing Putin does fear is the ability of the Russian people to rise up against him,” Schiff added. “Until he feels that his own regime is at risk, it’s hard to see him looking for an exit ramp.” Another Democrat on the panel put the question a bit more bluntly. “A lot of my constituents think that Putin is crazy, or he's playing crazy. In an open setting, how do you assess Putin's mental state?” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., asked Burns. “I think his views, congressman, on Ukraine and a lot of other issues, have hardened over the years. I think he's far more insulated from other points of view, and people who would challenge or question his views,” Burns said. “In my opinion, that doesn't make him crazy. But it makes him extremely difficult to deal with, because of the hardening of his views over time and the narrowing of his inner circle.”",Politics/Yahoo News,'Putin is angry': U.S. intel chiefs warn that Russia may escalate attacks,https://news.yahoo.com/putin-is-angry-us-intel-chiefs-warn-that-russia-may-escalate-attacks-192751180.html
3/11/2022,"WARSAW (Reuters) -Poland is ready to deploy all its MIG-29 jets to Ramstein Air Base in Germany and put them at the disposal of the United States, and urges other NATO members that own planes of that type to do the same, the Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday. U.S. lawmakers pushed President Joe Biden's administration on Monday to facilitate the transfer of fighter aircraft to Ukraine from Poland as well as other NATO and Eastern European countries, after a plea on Saturday from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. ""The authorities of the Republic of Poland ... are ready to deploy – immediately and free of charge – all their MIG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America,"" the ministry said. ""At the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes,"" it said in a statement. Ukraine's military already flies Russian-made aircraft, making them the best choice for Ukrainian pilots who already know how to operate them, experts say. Combat pilot training on U.S.-made aircraft can take years and requires a different pipeline for maintenance. In neighbouring Slovakia, Defence Minister Jaroslav Nad reiterated the country's general aim was to replace Russian military equipment, including MiG-29 fighter jets, but said the country was not yet ready for such as step. ""At the moment, we don't have a replacement for the MiGs, but we are doing everything to speed up the processes,"" Nad said in a statement released after he spoke by phone with U.S. Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin. Poland is supporting Kyiv with defensive weapons, but has said it would not send jets to Ukraine, as it is not a direct party to the conflict between Ukraine - which is not a NATO ally - and Russia. ""...any decisions on delivering offensive weapons have to be taken by the entire NATO and on a unanimous basis,"" Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Tuesday during a joint news conference with his Norwegian counterpart in Oslo. ""This is why we are ready to give all of our fleet of jet fighters to Ramstein, but we are not ready to make any moves on our own because, as I said, we are not party to this war,"" he added.

3/11/2022,"Fox host Greg Gutfeld suggested that reporters are exaggerating the scale of disaster in Ukraine. Reporter Benjamin Hall, who was in Kyiv, hit back and said the catastrophic picture is accurate. Hall described how cities have been flattened and 2 million Ukrainians fled Russia's invasion. A Fox News reporter in Kyiv openly challenged comments by his colleague Greg Gutfeld, who on Tuesday claimed that the media was exaggerating the scale of disaster caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Speaking on ""The Five"" on Tuesday night, Gutfeld claimed that the media was trying to create ""some sort of emotional response"" which in turn ""creates a profit for news companies."" Gutfeld compared the coverage of the invasion of Ukraine to the reporting on police brutality in the US, suggesting that the media creates a ""galvanizing narrative"" to elicit a reaction from the public. ""If you try to counter the drumbeat, you're seen as an inconsiderate, cold-hearted pussy,"" Gutfeld said. Fellow host Geraldo Rivera responded to the comments by bringing attention to a photo published by The New York Times of a mother and her two children moments after being killed by a Russian shell. But the real disagreement came from reporter Benjamin Hall, speaking live from Kyiv, who went on to describe what he had seen in Ukraine. ""Speaking as someone on the ground, I want to say that this is not the media trying to drum up some emotional response,"" Hall said. ""This is absolutely what is happening."" He described how cities are being ""absolutely flattened,"" and described the huge numbers of people evacuating for their safety. At least two million people had fled Ukraine as of Tuesday, according to the United Nations. The Independent reported that Gutfeld's own mother-in-law is among them. In the city of Mariupol, Hall continued, people were drinking puddle water because the Russian forces aren't allowing them to get out. People were being shelled while fleeing, he said, a reference to the repeated failure of attempts to provide so-called humanitarian corridors to get civilians out of the city. ""It's an absolute catastrophe and the people who are caught in the middle are the ones who are really suffering,"" Hall said. The reporter then played a clip of people trying to flee, who described how they had left everything behind. ""There is more video than we know what to do with,"" Hall said. Gutfeld in response asked whether he should respond to the ""cheap attack"" on him or move on. ""My concern has always been when a narrative creates a story that bolsters one side, that is out of its element, we create more suffering,"" Gutfeld said. Last week, in an emergency session of the UN's general assembly, a vast majority of member states voted for a resolution deploring Russia's invasion of Ukraine and calling for the withdrawal of its forces. 141 of the 193 countries voted for the resolution, with only five voting against it.

3/11/2022,"Smokey Robinson’s poem “A Black American” sparked a widespread discussion about racial identity following its original performance nearly 18 years ago during the season finale of “Russell Simmons Presents Def Poetry.” While the scripture aimed to educate its readers about the Black experience and what Black people have been called or regarded as over the years, it also sought to explain what being Black meant to the now 82-year-old. During a virtual appearance on “The View” last month, the legendary soul singer-songwriter opened up about the poem after it was turned into an animation by a teacher trying to educate his students about the Black experience during Black History Month. When asked what being Black American means to you, the singer stunned viewers after admitting that he resented being labeled “African American.” It’s a comment, along with others in that same vein, that now has arrested the attention of social media users, who are posting about it online weeks after Robinson’s interview. “I resent being called African American because Black people have contributed so much to the development of the United States of America,” the Motown icon said. “I think that when you do that, you’re disclaiming all the things, the contributions that Black people have made to America,” he added. “You see, I consider myself to be a Black American, and I enjoy being called Black, and Black has been so negativized as a color down throughout history by those who wanted to negativize it. And so, it spilled over into the Black community and to the Black people. And even Black people back in the day calling each other Black was a sign for a fight,” the iconic entertainer continued. “I resent being called African American because Black people have contributed so much to the development of the United States of America,” he added while describing what he calls the greatest gift Blacks gave to America: their lives. “The wonderful Black American who served in the armed forces and gave their lives in all the wars. They did not do that for Timbuktu or Capetown, or Kenya. They did that for Louisiana and Mississippi and Texas and Virginia. Okay? So that’s how I feel about it.” Robinson noted that their contributions should be recognized similarly to their white peers. Robinson’s philosophy is drawing mixed reactions online, including one Twitter user who wrote, “Smokey Robinson… a man born in the 1940’s is on the internet tellin people to drop the African and just call him Black American. Cause he never been to Africa. What’s the stages of Dementia?” Smokey Robinson… a man born in the 1940’s is on the internet tellin people to drop the African and just call him Black American.

3/11/2022,"By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Thursday he did not believe the conflict in Ukraine would spiral into a nuclear war but cautioned the United States and Europe that Moscow never again wanted to be dependent on the West. Russia's economy is facing the gravest crisis since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union after the West slapped heavy sanctions on almost the entire Russian financial and corporate system following Moscow's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Asked by a Kremlin correspondent for Russia's Kommersant newspaper if he thought a nuclear war could be triggered, Lavrov told reporters in Turkey: ""I don't want to believe it, and I do not believe it."" Lavrov, President Vladimir Putin's foreign minister since 2004, said the nuclear theme had been thrown into discussions only by the West, which he said kept on returning to nuclear war like Sigmund Freud, the father of psychoanalysis. ""Of course it gives us cause for concern when the West, like Freud, keeps on returning and returning to this topic,"" Lavrov said after talks in Antalya, Turkey with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba. Lavrov said talk of a potential Russian attack on the formerly Soviet Baltic states - Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, now all members of the European Union and NATO - ""appear to be old hoaxes"". Russia and the United States have by the biggest arsenals of nuclear warheads after the Cold War that divided the world for much of the 20th century, pitting the West against the Soviet Union and its allies. Putin on Feb. 27 ordered Russia's nuclear forces to be put on high alert, citing Western sanctions and aggressive remarks by leading members of the NATO military alliance. Russian officials later cited British comments about a possible confrontation between NATO and Russia. GO EAST Putin says the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is essential to ensure Russian security after the United States enlarged the membership of NATO up to Russia's borders and supported pro-Western leaders in Kyiv. Ukraine says it is fighting for its existence and the United States, and its European and Asian allies have condemned the Russian invasion. China has called for calm. Now that the West has meted out crippling sanctions on Russia, Lavrov said Moscow was turning away from the West and would cope with the economic consequences. ""We'll emerge from this crisis with a revitalised psychology and conscience: We won't have any illusions that the West can be a reliable partner,"" Lavrov said. ""We will do everything to ensure that we never again depend on the West in those areas of our life which have a significant meaning for our people."" In Moscow, Sergei Chemezov, a close ally of Putin, also defended Russian actions in Ukraine, saying that Russia could endure the crippling sanctions imposed by the West and would ultimately emerge victorious. ""If you glance at Russia's history, almost all of that history Russia has battled with different sanctions, with enemies which encircled her, and she always came out as the victor,"" Rostec CEO Chemezov told staff. ""Now will be the same,"" said Chemezov, who worked as a KGB spy with Putin in former East Germany before the Soviet break-up. When the Soviet Union crumbled, many people in Russia and the West hoped that the divisions of the Cold War were over. Asked about energy sanctions imposed by the United States, Lavrov said Russia would not try to convince any purchaser to buy its energy. In a clear reference to China, the world's second largest economy, Lavrov said Russia had markets for its oil and gas.
