4/3/2022,"(Reuters) - Russian lawmakers will propose measures seeking punishment for the implementation of sanctions on Russia's territory, a senior lawmaker said on Sunday. ""My colleagues from the State Duma and I have finished the work and on Monday we will introduce amendments to the Criminal Code for the implementation of restrictive measures (sanctions) imposed by foreign states on the territory of the Russian Federation,"" Andrei Klishas wrote on his Telegram channel. ""We look forward to prompt consideration of the amendments by the State Duma."" Klishas did not specify how Russia would identify or punish those who implemented sanctions. Russian lawmakers in early March passed amendments to the code making the spread of ""fake"" information an offence punishable by fines or jail terms. They imposed fines for public calls for sanctions against Russia. Western allies of Ukraine have implemented a series of sanctions on Russia for the Feb. 24 invasion on Ukraine that Moscow calls a ""special operation,"" and has killed thousands of Ukrainians and send millions fleeing the country.

4/3/2022,"Naveen Jain is worth an estimated $8 billion. But it wasn't always that way. “The life of an entrepreneur is like a heartbeat. It goes up and down, and up and down, and when it’s smooth, you are dead. If you ever find yourself living life smoothly, that means you are living the life of a dead person, and that’s not the life you ever want,” Jain told Fortune in a recent interview. This is one of the many lessons Naveen Jain, founder of InfoSpace, Moon Express, and most recently, dietary testing startup Viome, has learned in life. Born into poverty in India, Jain spent a lot of his childhood moving from city to city, attending desolate schools lacking basic furnishings like chairs and tables. But despite receiving a less than subpar primary education, Jain attended the prestigious IIT (also known as the Indian MIT), obtained his MBA, and landed in the U.S. for a work training. He had only $5 to spare. “Immigrant entrepreneurs…we all come from very humble backgrounds. The goal in life is to stay focused on what makes life better for everyone else around. Focus on your karma,” says Jain. After arriving in the U.S. and working for several tech startups, Jain moved up the ranks of Silicon Valley, working closely with Bill Gates at Microsoft. Frustrated with his inability to make a big impact as part of a large corporation, he quit his job to start InfoSpace. The search engine and database eventually grew into a $31 billion enterprise at its peak. Jain says the secret to creating a billion-dollar company is to build a product or service that can help a billion people live a better life. After InfoSpace, Jain redefined what was possible with his company Moon Express, which became the first company to get the U.S. government’s approval to send a robotic spacecraft to the moon. “To me, every entrepreneur probably has been told by a hundred people that ‘this is a stupid idea or this won’t work.’ Every idea is a crazy idea until the breakthrough happens…then it becomes an obvious idea.” Jain says the people who often disrupt industries with their ""crazy"" ideas are often nonexperts who, because of their naivety, are able to challenge the foundation of everything that industry insiders take for granted. “Think about it. Who would disrupt the space industry? It was internet guys like Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson. Who disrupted the automotive space? Wasn’t the GMs or any of the Fords…It was Tesla. It wasn't the taxi industry that disrupted itself. It was Uber that came along and disrupted it,” he said. Jain practices what he preaches. As a tech professional with no health care background, he’s now disrupting the health industry with his wellness brand, Viome, which is on a mission to eliminate chronic illnesses and create a disease-free world. Viome recently received a breakthrough device designation by the FDA to detect Stage 1 oral and throat cancer simply with a person’s spit. Jain has amassed much success and recognition throughout his career, and he believes that life has been his biggest teacher through it all. He summarized his top advice for success. Prioritize service over money. Focus on what you can control instead of what you can’t. Treat everything as information and then form your own opinion. Challenge the status quo. Ask the right questions. The question you ask is the problem you solve. Don’t seek other people's approval. Love yourself and don’t change one bit.
