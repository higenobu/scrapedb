3/17/2022,"Moscow and Kyiv have lifted hope of a potential breakthrough in Ukraine after three weeks of war. Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said negotiations were becoming ""more realistic"", while Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said the proposals now being discussed were ""close to an agreement"". The marked change in tone came as Vladimir Putin, who ordered his troops into Ukraine on 24 February, said Moscow was ready to discuss neutral status for its neighbour. Ukraine's chief negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, said Kyiv was seeking direct talks between Zelenskyy and Putin, but he dismissed an earlier report in the Financial Times that the two sides had already drawn up a draft 15-point peace plan. Three people close to the talks told the newspaper that the deal included a ceasefire being declared; the Ukrainian government declaring neutrality; Kyiv accepting limits on its armed forces; and Putin's forces withdrawing from the country. It would also require Kyiv to formally drop its ambition to join Nato and not host foreign military bases or weaponry. In exchange, they would get protection from allies, such as the US, UK and Turkey. However, Podolyak rejected the claims via Twitter, saying: ""Briefly. FT published a draft, which represents the requesting position of the Russian side. Nothing more. The Ukraine side has its own positions."" He did confirm some elements of the draft deal, including ""a ceasefire, withdrawal of Russian troops and security guarantees from a number of countries"". Speaking on the third straight day of talks, Lavrov confirmed there was ""some hope for compromise"", and highlighted two key points being put on the table: Russia seeks to ensure Ukraine maintains a neutral status, meaning it would never join Nato Ukraine seeks security guarantees that are ""legally verified"". Zelenskyy has appeared to acknowledge that Ukraine will not become a Nato member in one of the key elements of the negotiations. Ukraine's chief negotiator Podolyak added that, instead, the country could agree only to “a special version of neutrality with legally verified and non-protocol security guarantees"". In a statement on Telegram, he said: ""Ukraine has never been a militaristic state that attacks or plans to attack its neighbours, unlike some neighbours.""

The Kremlin said the sides were discussing a status for Ukraine similar to that of Austria or Sweden, members of the European Union that are outside the Nato military alliance. Lavrov also said of the talks: ""The negotiations are not easy for obvious reasons. But nevertheless, there is some hope of reaching a compromise."" ""Neutral status is now being seriously discussed along, of course, with security guarantees,"" he added. ""Now this very thing is being discussed in negotiations – there are absolutely specific formulations which in my view are close to agreement."" Three weeks into the invasion, Russian troops have been halted at the gates of Kyiv, having taken heavy losses and failed to seize any of Ukraine's biggest cities. Western officials believe Moscow thought it would win within days, and one of Putin's own military chiefs, National Guard head Viktor Zolotov, admitting on Tuesday that ""not everything"" was going to plan for the Russian forces. On the guard's website, the general said: “I would like to say yes, not everything is going as fast as we would like. ""But we are going towards our goal step by step and victory will be for us, and this icon will protect the Russian army and accelerate our victory."" However, on Wednesday Putin doubled down, claiming the ""special military operation"" was ""going to plan"". In a televised speech to government ministers, Putin claimed the West was trying to ""cancel Russia"" with an ""economic Blitzkreig"" of sanctions, but said the nation could bear the brunt. Putin also claimed that the war – which has displaced millions of people – has been used by the West to impose sanctions because ""they just don't want a strong and sovereign Russia"". Adding that the West's actions would ""only strengthen"" Russia, he added: ""The West doesn't even bother to hide the fact that its aim is to damage the entire Russian economy, every Russian."" Zolotov’s comments were in stark contrast to Russia's defence minister Sergei Shoigu, who told Putin on Friday: ""Everything is going according to plan.” Ukrainian officials have expressed hope this week that the war could end sooner than expected - even within weeks - as Moscow was coming to terms with a lack of fresh troops to keep fighting. In an intelligence assessment released on Wednesday, Britain said Russian forces were trapped on roads, struggling to cope with Ukrainian terrain and suffering from a failure to gain control of the air. ""The tactics of the Ukrainian Armed Forces have adeptly exploited Russia's lack of manoeuvre, frustrating the Russian advance and inflicting heavy losses on the invading forces,"" it said. Putin's invasion has sparked the biggest humanitarian crisis since the Second World War, with three million people having fled Ukraine in search of safety.

But some people are going the other way, returning to Ukraine with aid, to collect family members or to fight. We spent a day meeting those queueing to cross back into Ukraine, unsure what they will find there. Exact numbers of those killed are so far impossible to verify, by Ukraine has claimed more than 12,000 Russian soldiers have died in the offensive. Over 2,000 civilians, including 100 children, are also thought to have been killed. Kyiv has been pounded with Russian shells and missiles since the invasion began three weeks ago, prompting half the population to flee in search of safety. Authorities imposed a 35-hour curfew on Tuesday night amid fears the Russian campaign has shifted to the destruction of residential areas. Ukraine's former finance minister Oleksandr Danylyuk described any attempts by Putin's forces to take Kyiv as a ""suicide mission"".

3/17/2022,"The Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov said Vladimir Putin would destroy Elon Musk in a fight. It came after Musk challenged Russia's leader to ""single combat"" to decide Ukraine's fate. Kadyrov, a Putin loyalist, joined in the macho posturing in a lengthy Telegram post on Monday. The Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov responded to Elon Musk's surreal offer to fight Russian President Vladimir Putin in single combat over the fate of Ukraine, saying that Musk would face swift defeat. Kadyrov, a top Putin ally who rules Russia's quasi-autonomous Chechnya region, said Putin would destroy Musk in a fight. ""I would not advise you to compete with Putin,"" he wrote in a lengthy Telegram post. It came after the Tesla CEO posted on Twitter Monday to challenge Putin to ""single combat"" over Ukraine. —Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 14, 2022 Kadyrov seemed amused in his response and offered Musk some ways to get stronger before facing Putin. Both Ukrainian and Russian news sources have reported Chechen soldiers fighting in Ukraine, and Kadyrov has claimed to be on the battlefield himself. Kadyrov noted Putin's qualifications in judo but said this was not the main reason Musk would lose. He said Musk was merely a ""businessman and Twitter blogger"" compared with Putin, a ""world politician, strategist, a scourge of the West and the US."" Putin, he said, ""would look unsportsmanlike beating a weaker opponent."" Instead, he said, Musk should undergo training at one of Kadyrov's special-forces academies and at ""Fight Club Akhmat"" — a chain of Chechen boxing clubs he founded and named after his father, the former Chechen ruler Akhmat Kadyrov. Ramzan Kadyrov is one of Putin's firmest loyalists. Putin formally handed Kadyrov the leadership of Chechnya in 2011 after Kadyrov spent several years as the region's prime minister. His personal fighting units have earned a bloodthirsty reputation. While Putin has embraced that image for his own propaganda purposes, an analysis from the think tank New Lines Institute said: ""Their operational effectiveness has not lived up to the hype."" In the invasion of Ukraine, Kadyrov has repeatedly called for harsher attacks, frustrated by Russia's lumbering advance. On Sunday, he claimed to be near Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, with his soldiers, without providing evidence. Kadyrov's hypermasculine posturing is underpinned by brutal rule. According to Human Rights Watch, he has led a crackdown on LGBTQ rights and is known for extensive use of torture, forced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings, all tolerated by Putin.

3/17/2022,"A former U.S. Army general predicted Monday that the Russian military could soon run out of the manpower and weaponry needed to continue its invasion of Ukraine. Retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the former commander of U.S. Army forces in Europe, said recent moves by Russia to extend its campaign to western Ukraine and reports that the country had asked China for military supplies may mean the Kremlin is running out of steam. “Russia’s decision to transition to a war of attrition, where they’re smashing cities, putting civilians on the road for fear of being murdered, they need three things to do this, and they don’t have those three things,” Hodges said on MSNBC’s “Meet the Press.” “They don’t have the time, they don’t have the manpower and I don’t think they have the ammunition.” Hodges’ comments were buoyed by evidence that Russia was running low on weaponry as Ukraine continued to mount a fiercer-than-expected resistance, notably around the capital of Kyiv. He said that if the West continued to support Ukrainians, it could be less than two weeks before the Russian military reached what he referred to as its culmination point. “Assuming that we, the West, not only continue but accelerate the delivery of the capabilities the Ukrainians need, I think within the next 10 days that Russia is going to culminate, which means they will not be able to continue the attack any further,” Hodges said. “So, it’s kind of a race, actually, if we give the Ukrainians enough so they can outlast Russia.” Hodges added that there was a big caveat to his prediction, a nod to Putin’s unpredictability during the invasion. “I’ve been wrong a lot,” he said. “I don’t have a crystal ball here.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.
