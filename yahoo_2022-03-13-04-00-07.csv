3/13/2022,"Jussie Smollett has spent his first night in Cook County Jail. After being sentenced Thursday to 150 days in jail for staging a hate crime against himself, the former Empire actor, 39, was taken into custody immediately, screaming as he left the Chicago courtroom. ""I'm not suicidal, and I am innocent,"" he yelled before disappearing through the door. With a fist in the air, he added, ""I could have said I was guilty a long time ago."" Jussie was then processed as an inmate, being assigned the booking number 20220310140. While still wearing the white dress shirt he had on in court, but sans tie and suit jacket, he took a new mug shot. In it, he was expressionless, but his head was held high. It's unclear who exactly is controlling the actor and singer's social media while he's incarcerated, but the quote he gave while being taken off to jail has since been posted to his Instagram page. ""I am innocent and I am not suicidal,"" it read. The caption said, ""OUR BROTHER IS INNOCENT AND WE WILL KEEP FIGHTING. #FreeJussie."" In a statement to Yahoo Entertainment, the Cook County Sheriff's Office clarified Smollett's ""protective custody status"" behind bars: ""Mr. Smollett is not being held in solitary confinement. The use of solitary confinement was abolished at the Cook County Jail in 2016, and any claims that he is being held in this manner is false. Mr. Smollett is being housed in his own cell, which is monitored by security cameras in the cell and by an officer wearing a body worn camera who is stationed at the entrance of the cell to ensure that Mr. Smollett is under direct observation at all times. As with all detained persons, Mr. Smollett is entitled to have substantial time out of his cell in the common areas on the tier where he is housed, where he is able to use the telephone, watch television, and interact with staff. During such times out of cell, other detainees will not be present in the common areas. These protocols are routinely used for individuals ordered into protective custody who may potentially be at risk of harm due to the nature of their charges, their profession, or their noteworthy status. The safety and security of all detained individuals, including Mr. Smollett, is the Sheriff's Office’s highest priority."" Jussie was accompanied to court by several family members, including his 92-year-old grandma, who spoke on his behalf to the judge, slamming the media and asking to be sent to jail too if her grandson had to go.    A post shared by @jussiesmollett Outside court, after Jussie was taken away, the Smollett siblings continued to support him in a series of impassioned comments. His brother Jocqui Smollett said his brother is a ""complete victim"" in this. ""He was attacked and he is now going to jail for being attacked."" He went on to say, ""He's a survivor and he's been completely mistreated and this has to stop.""

What should be controversial is the entire miscarriage of justice his whole ordeal has been."" Jojo Smollett took issue with Judge James B. Linn's comments about Jussie — whom he called ""profoundly arrogant,"" ""selfish"" and a ""narcissistic"" — before sentencing him to 150 days in jail, 30 months of felony probation and ordering him to pay $120,106 of restitution to the city of Chicago and a $25,000 fine. ""[The judge] shamed my brother, he spoke about his arrogance,"" JoJo said. ""He doesn't know the struggles my brother is encountering. He doesn't know anything that he's dealing with.... In 2022, we don't shame people like this. Alright? He basically called him a mental case."" Jussie is being housed in Division 8 of Cook County Jail. He can have visitors five days a week, there is a health services facility, two education departments, a commissary and a day room on each unit for eating and watching TV. Thursday's sentencing took nearly six hours as the defense made a last-minute attempt to get a new trial. Jussie declined to speak out formally on his own behalf but then started yelling once the sentence was handed down. Jussie was found guilty in December on five felony counts of disorderly conduct for making false reports stemming from staging a hate crime against himself in January 2019. The actor, who is Black and gay, claimed two men wearing ski masks poured bleach on him, put a noose around his neck and yelled racist and homophobic slurs on a freezing Chicago night when he was walking home at 2 a.m. The police investigation led to two brothers, Abimbola (""Bola"") and Olabinjo (""Ola"") Osundairo, acquaintances of the actor, who said Smollett paid them $3,500 to stage the attack. Smollett was initially indicted in March 2019 on 16 counts of felony disorderly conduct. However, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx's office dropped all charges weeks later, keeping his $10,000 bond and saying the community service he had completed was enough. However, a special prosecutor was appointed to look into the case in August 2019, leading to new charges against Jussie and, ultimately, his conviction on five of the six charges. Actor Jussie Smollett, who was convicted of lying to police about being the victim of a racist and homophobic attack that authorities said he orchestrated, was sentenced on Thursday to 150 days in jail and 30 months probation. Immediately following the sentence Smollett declared “I am not suicidal” and maintained his innocence.",U.S./Yahoo Celebrity,Jussie Smollett pictured in new mug shot as 150-day jail sentence begins,https://news.yahoo.com/jussie-smollett-150-day-jail-sentence-begins-mug-shot-154643200.html

3/13/2022,"By Emilio Parodi BERGAMO, Italy (Reuters) -Italian police have seized a superyacht owned by Russian billionaire Andrey Igorevich Melnichenko, the prime minister's office said on Saturday, a few days after the businessman was placed on an EU sanctions list following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The 143-metre (470-foot) Sailing Yacht A, which has a price tag of 530 million euros ($578 million), has been sequestered at the northern port of Trieste, the government said. Designed by Philippe Starck and built by Nobiskrug in Germany, the vessel is the world's biggest sailing yacht, the government said. Melnichenko owned major fertiliser producer EuroChem Group and coal company SUEK. The companies said in statements on Thursday that he had resigned as a member of the board in both companies and withdrawn as their beneficiary, effective Wednesday. A spokesperson for Melnichenko, Alex Andreev, said the businessman had ""no relation to the tragic events in Ukraine. He has no political affiliations"". ""There is no justification whatsoever for placing him on the EU sanctions list,"" Andreev said. ""We will be disputing these baseless and unjustified sanctions, and believe that the rule of law and common sense will prevail. Since last week Italian police have seized villas and yachts worth more than 700 million euros ($763.63 million) from high-profile Russians who have been placed on the EU sanctions list, Economy Minister Daniele Franco said on Saturday. ""So far we have hit what was visible, now we have to hit the rest such as shareholdings. We are doing a great job to bring out what is shielded by trusts and front names,"" Giuseppe Zafarana, head of the Italian tax police, told journalists in Bergamo on Saturday. The police operations were part of a coordinated drive by Western states to penalise wealthy Russians they say are linked to President Vladimir Putin. Separately, a superyacht reported to be owned by Russian businessman Roman Abramovich arrived in Montenegro's territorial waters on Saturday morning, according to a Reuters photographer. The Solaris is one of a string of yachts owned by Chelsea Football Club owner Abramovich, according to reports in luxury goods publications SuperYachtFan, SuperYacht Times and Forbes. The 140-metre (460-foot) vessel is moored off the luxury resort Porto Montenegro in the town of Tivat. The boat left Barcelona on Tuesday. Britain imposed sanctions on Abramovich on Thursday, freezing his assets and citing what it called his close relationship with Putin. Abramovich has denied having such ties.
