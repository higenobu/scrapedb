1/7/2022,"The UK has reported a further 179,756 Covid cases, as the number of people infected with the Omicron variant continues to surge. The latest figures – which reflect infections picked up by testing – bring the UK total for the past seven days to 1,272,131, up 29% on the week before. The true number of infections is estimated to be substantially higher as not all infections are captured by the testing programme.  The figure does not include reinfections for most of the countries in the UK, and reflects cases by date reported, rather than by specimen date. Data released on Thursday also reveals that in England there are 17,988 Covid patients in hospital, up from 15,659 the day before. A further 231 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were reported in the UK on Thursday.The data comes as the latest weekly Flu and Covid-19 Surveillance report from the UK Health Security Agency revealed that Covid case rates rose considerably in England between 27 December 2021 and 2 January 2022, particularly in the north-east and among white ethnic groups. The report adds that weekly case rates were highest in those aged 20 to 29, at 2,780.7 per 100,000 population, compared with 552.0 per 100,000 population in those under the age of five.Covid hospital admission rates also rose, with the highest rates recorded in London and in those aged 85 and over. The UKHSA adds that levels of flu remain low, and that the uptake of flu jabs among those aged 65 and over is, at 81.4%, at a record level. Dr William Welfare of the UK Health Security Agency, urged everyone to work together to protect loved ones and the healthcare service. “That includes taking a lateral flow test before meeting people, ventilating indoor spaces, wearing a face covering in crowded enclosed spaces, and staying at home if you have symptoms,” he said. “Don’t take chances with this virus - please get your vaccination or booster jab if you haven’t already.”",News/World news,"UK reports 179,756 new Covid cases as Omicron surge continues",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/uk-reports-179756-new-covid-cases-as-omicron-surge-continues
1/7/2022,"Travel firms and airlines have reported surging bookings following the relaxation of Covid testing requirements for travellers returning to the UK. EasyJet said there were almost three times as many flights bought in the UK in the hours following the prime minister’s announcement on Wednesday than in the same period the week before, while holiday firm TUI said there had been “an immediate and strong uptick in bookings”.  British Airways Holidays said searches for holidays on its websites increased by nearly 40% compared with the week before. From 4am on Friday, international arrivals or holidaymakers returning to England will not need to produce a negative pre-departure test, nor self-isolate until they receive a further negative PCR test result from the first two days on arrival. The aviation and travel industry had long argued that the prevalence of the Omicron variant meant the measures had little public health benefit but were causing significant damage to their businesses. Alistair Rowland, chairman of travel association Abta and chief executive of long-haul tour operator Blue Bay Travel, said the scrapping of the pre-departure test and ditching post-arrival PCR tests for lateral flow tests was “a relief for the travel industry and great news for holidaymakers”. He said that the news had prompted his firm’s busiest day for website traffic and booking inquiries in more than a year, “which is something we couldn’t have imagined a month ago, when these testing rules came in and consumer confidence plummeted”. EasyJet said flights to Spanish destinations, especially the Canary Islands, were most in demand, led by Tenerife, Alicante, Málaga and Lanzarote, with bookings to Lanzarote up 427% week on week. Tui also said the Canary Islands, along with Mexico, were seeing the biggest increase in summer holiday bookings so far. EasyJet said its customer surveys showed around half of British consumers were planning to take more holiday than usual this year, with a third planning to spend up to £1,000 more after missing trips abroad during the pandemic. Sophie Dekkers, chief commercial officer at easyJet, said: “We know that there is pent up demand with many desperate to get away this year, which we continue to see each time restrictions are removed.” On The Beach chief executive Simon Cooper said the restrictions introduced in response to the Omicron variants had slowed bookings in December but the news had prompted “a fantastic surge” on Wednesday evening. He told the BBC: “We will expect to massively out-trade 12 months ago.” But he said that Covid had left “a level of nervousness”, adding: “People can now book with confidence to travel in the shorter term, with reasonable knowledge that they’re not going to have these tests reimposed … of course with longer lead time bookings, for summer 2022, as yet unknown.”",News/Business,Britain races to book holidays after Covid testing relaxed,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/06/britain-holidays-surge-covid-testing-relaxed-travel-industry
1/7/2022,"In recent weeks a number of managers have been absent from matches owing to positive Covid tests, with Pep Guardiola and Sean Dyche the latest to leave gaping holes in the dugout. Personally I always missed my manager when they weren’t there but this isn’t the same for every player. By this stage of the season players will know what their manager wants from them on the pitch because they are training every day to hone their craft and perfect tactics. The relentless nature of the schedule means it is pretty difficult to make major changes between games. Only minor tweaks are made to formations and styles but managers are still crucial to the squad environment.  Certain players in my experience would take liberties in training if a manager was absent, doing things they knew they would not get away with in the presence of the person in charge, but this did not seep through to matches. On the flip side, I spoke to a former Manchester United played who told me he redoubled his efforts in training if Sir Alex Ferguson was not there because he feared information getting back to the manager that he had been slacking off, fully aware that Ferguson knew everything that happened whether he was present or not. A manager is unlikely to tell a player something they do not know on a match day but their aura is what I missed within a dressing room and on the sidelines. If you look at Jürgen Klopp, for example, he prowls the pitch before the game watching the opposition warm up and his energetic style rouses the crowd and players. Without him prowling the touchline Anfield and the team would be a very different proposition. Within a dressing room the manager will have authority – or least should – and they can utilise it to bring calmness, especially at half-time. Players come in highly emotional after the first 45 minutes whether things are going well or badly and they need that calm to bring them back down and regain focus. I played at Arsenal under Vik Akers, who worked closely with Arsène Wenger, and he had the great reassuring ability to bring players back down to an equilibrium. Managers are often enigmatic characters – they are people you want to play for. I am sure players have signed for Liverpool because of the person Klopp is and the same with Pep Guardiola at Manchester City. Emma Hayes was one of the key reasons I joined Chelsea; I wanted to play for the club, but it is her dream and vision driving it. She knew me from working together at Chicago Red Stars and was clear about what role she recruited me to play. When she was not there, I might not have that connection with the assistant or other staff members. I did not need her at the games but I did miss her when she was not there – for the assurance she offered me. I remember Emma was absent when we won the Women’s Super League at Chelsea in 2018 because of her pregnancy. We had to video call her after the match to celebrate, which is a bit different from in the traditional dressing-room celebrations. Those left in charge on the day need to be strong characters to cope without the person they and the players might turn to when things are not going well. As a player you are only as strong as your physios, doctors, manager, coaches and even set-play specialist, because they get you wins. It is important that the assistant knows what they are doing and is strong enough to cope with the added scrutiny. Some managers can be quite controlling and do not delegate but if they have good staff the manager should entrust them, which ought to help if they are ever absent. Any disruption in routine can cause a problem for teams and put them on the back foot before a ball is kicked, so it is key to minimise the impact on players, and a strong backroom staff can ensure that. Thanks to technology, a manager can be in constant touch with their coaching staff throughout a match they aren’t at, which reduces the effects of their absence. By watching on TV they will have a different perspective from those on the touchline, and that can be very useful. I will notice things on TV which I would not have spotted if I was at the stadium. Match days have changed down the years. When I was starting out the manager would give their pre-match talk in the dressing room and have long chats with players, whereas towards the end of my career this was done at the team hotel. They would go into great detail away from the ground and just save up a few words of encouragement at the stadium before we went out to play, allowing players to focus on the game. Potentially now an absent manager could still do this over a video call, even though it is not the same. Driving, for example, is always best when you have a passenger to help get you to the right destination because going it alone makes life more difficult. You can always turn to them to give directions and a manager does that for players when they need a little guidance and support. People can underestimate what a manager can do on a match day. Without them players risk getting lost.",Sport/Football,Why not having your manager in the dugout really can make a difference | Karen Carney,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/06/why-not-having-your-manager-in-the-dugout-really-can-make-a-difference
1/7/2022,"Leaked files appear to suggest the Conservative peer Michelle Mone and her husband, Douglas Barrowman, were secretly involved in a PPE business that was awarded more than £200m in government contracts after she referred it to the Cabinet Office. Barrowman, an Isle of Man-based financier, may have played a central role in the business deal that enabled PPE Medpro to sell millions of masks and surgical gowns to the government at the start of the pandemic, documents suggest.  One person closely involved in PPE Medpro claimed Barrowman was “part of the financial consortium that backed” the company and was even involved in initial conversations with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). Documents seen by the Guardian suggest he and Lady Mone were kept informed of specific commercial arrangements about PPE Medpro’s supplies. And Mone appears to have sent messages to an individual in PPE Medpro’s supply chain about the contract to supply gowns. The couple’s apparent involvement in the business activities of PPE Medpro, which was fast-tracked through the government’s “VIP lane” after Mone’s referral, will reignite controversy over Tory-linked firms profiting from government contracts during the pandemic. It will also raise questions about repeated attempts by Mone and Barrowman to distance themselves from PPE Medpro. The identities of the people behind PPE Medpro, which was awarded contracts by the government in May and June 2020, has been an enduring mystery ever since and the subject of considerable speculation. Citing confidentiality obligations, PPE Medpro, which was set up weeks before securing the lucrative government contracts, has always refused to identify what it described as the “consortium of successful entrepreneurs that comprise, have financed and backed” the company. It was not until November 2021 – 18 months after PPE Medpro won its first contract – that a Freedom of Information Act request revealed that Mone had referred the company to the Cabinet Office, leading to it being processed through the high-priority VIP lane for politically connected companies. Lawyers for Mone, who ran a lingerie company before David Cameron made her a member of the House of Lords, have always said she “was not connected to PPE Medpro in any capacity”. They also said she had no “association” with PPE Medpro, and “never had any role or function in PPE Medpro, nor in the process by which contracts were awarded” to the company. Once it had become public that she had recommended PPE Medpro to the Cabinet Office, Mone’s lawyers said that after the referral – which they described as a “very simple, solitary and brief step” – she “did not do anything further in respect of PPE Medpro”. Contacted about the Guardian’s new findings, Mone’s lawyers said its reporting was “grounded entirely on supposition and speculation and not based on accuracy” and declined to provide direct responses to a series of detailed questions. “You also appear to misunderstand our client’s responsibilities to you,” they said. “She is under no obligation to say anything to you.” Barrowman’s lawyers have also repeatedly distanced him from the company, saying he “never had any role or function in PPE Medpro” and stating that he was not an investor, director or shareholder of the company. In a statement issued in December 2020, PPE Medpro said: “Mr Barrowman was not personally involved in working for PPEM in relation to PPE contracts.” However, multiple sources and leaked files seen by the Guardian shed new light on PPE Medpro, its supply chain, and the commercial deal that enabled the newly created company to become a major player in the supply of personal protective equipment amid frantic global competition for supplies. The UK-registered PPE Medpro Ltd, which was incorporated on 12 May 2020, was in effect a subsidiary of another company that had been created in the Isle of Man the previous day, using the same name. A director of both the Isle of Man and UK versions of PPE Medpro was Anthony Page. A longtime employee in Barrowman’s Isle of Man-based financial services firm, the Knox Group, Page also runs Barrowman’s family office. During the same week that PPE Medpro was formed, it entered into a crucial business deal with the London-based importing company Loudwater Trade and Finance Ltd, which committed to source gowns and masks from factories in China. The contracts were signed by Page, the authorised signatory for PPE Medpro. However, documents seen by the Guardian appear to show Barrowman was personally involved in setting up PPE Medpro’s deal with Loudwater’s director, Maurice Stimler, as well as related business matters. Documents apparently setting out the terms of the three-year agreement show the companies agreed to divide profits equally with clearly demarcated responsibilities. Loudwater would “manage and secure the supply chain of key PPE items from China” and take responsibility for the import and delivery of the products. PPE Medpro’s role was to use its contacts to win business from the UK government. One document states the Isle of Man company would use its “extensive network to seek to secure rolling forward order contracts with the NHS and other government bodies within the British Isles”. The apparent agreements between the two companies were concluded on 11 May 2020, the leaked materials suggest. It is not known exactly when Mone referred PPE Medpro to the office of Theodore Agnew, a fellow Conservative peer and Cabinet Office minister closely involved in procurement for the NHS. Her referral is understood to have occurred around that time. Lord Agnew then referred PPE Medpro to the VIP lane, a fast-track process set up by DHSC procurement teams for offers to supply PPE from companies referred by ministers, MPs, NHS officials or other people with political connections. Under emergency rules introduced at that time, the government had abandoned the competitive tender procedures usually used for procurement. Analysis would later show that companies that entered the VIP lane were 10 times more likely to secure contracts with the UK government. Less than three weeks after entering into business with Loudwater, PPE Medpro secured an £80.85m government contract to supply 210m face masks. The following month, in June 2020, it won the second government contract worth £122m to supply 25m gowns. It is not known what, if anything, Mone told Agnew’s office about whether she or her husband were involved in PPE Medpro. However, files seen by the Guardian appear to show her involvement in PPE Medpro’s business affairs in June 2020, after the company had been awarded its first contract with the DHSC and during the period it was seeking to secure the second. Documents from that time appear to show both Mone and Barrowman included in correspondence between PPE Medpro’s suppliers about the cost price of gowns. WhatApp messages believed to have been sent by Mone around the same time appear to show her discussing the required sizes of the gowns, and details regarding the DHSC’s purchase order or “PO” process. In an exchange understood to have taken place days before PPE Medpro was awarded its second contract on 25 June 2020, a person in the supply chain appears to ask “Lady Michelle” for a conversation about the required sizes for the gowns. The reply apparently sent by Mone states: “We are just about to take off in the jet. The sizes are in the order. We are waiting for the official PO, this should come in today.” Moments later, she appears to add: “They tell you not to start until you have this PO.” Asked about the messages, Mone’s lawyers said she could not be expected to comment on “unknown and unattributable WhatsApp messages allegedly sent 19 months ago”. They added: “We have no idea – and neither does our client – of the content of the WhatsApp messages to which you refer, the recipients, the context and perhaps most important the provenance of them.” PPE Medpro’s contracts with the government resulted in profits for a string of other businesses that became involved in its newly established global supply chain. They included Loudwater, additional intermediaries who received substantial payments to offshore companies, and the Hong Kong-based trading company Eric Beare, which was the original source of the Chinese-produced PPE. The Guardian understands that PPE Medpro may have made in excess of £40m gross profits from its DHSC contracts. The company declined to say whether that figure was accurate. Responding to questions on behalf of PPE Medpro, Page accused the Guardian of pursuing an “improper witch-hunt” against the company based on “information that is wrong”. He would not comment on whether the company was seeking further contracts with the UK government’s test-and-trace programme as recently as February 2021, as was suggested in a recent report in the Financial Times. It quoted a leaked civil servant email, dated 10 February 2021, that appeared to suggest Mone was lobbying government officials on behalf of PPE Medpro. In the email, Jacqui Rock, chief commercial officer for the government’s test-and-trace programme, reportedly told colleagues: “We do have an issue here. Baroness Mone is going to Michael Gove and Matt Hancock today as she is incandescent with rage on the way she believes Medpro have been treating [sic] in the matter.” Mone’s lawyers declined to be drawn on why a civil servant may have perceived her to be “incandescent with rage” over the treatment of PPE Medpro as recently as February 2021. The lawyers said the “material quoted” from the leaked email was inaccurate, but provided no further explanation. Lawyers for Barrowman said the Guardian’s reporting amounted to “clutching at straws” and was “largely incorrect”. They added: “Our client’s desire not to reveal private or confidential information should not be taken as an assumption that any of your assertions or conclusions are correct or unchallenged.”",News/World news,Tory peer Michelle Mone secretly involved in PPE firm she referred to government ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/tory-peer-michelle-mone-involved-ppe-medpro-government-contracts
1/7/2022,"Farmers must “stand their ground” on price inflation and ensure that the rising costs they face are reflected in the prices paid to them by supermarkets for their produce, the UK’s environment, food and rural affairs secretary has demanded. George Eustice told the online Oxford Farming Conference on Thursday that rising input costs should result in higher incomes for farmers, but that increasing farm gate prices need not result in food inflation for consumers.  “We do need producers to stand their ground and take quite a tough position with retailers to ensure that the money they are paid reflects the costs of their production,” he told the conference. He said food prices were rising as a result of international pressures, as the price of farm commodities internationally was linked to energy prices, which have risen strongly as economies have recovered from the coronavirus shock. But he said farmers obtaining more for their produce need not affect consumers. “You can have reasonably modest increases in farm gate prices, and significant impact on farm profitability, that does not result in major changes to consumer inflation,” he said. Farming leaders reacted sceptically. Producers wield little power against the UK’s mighty supermarkets, a handful of which control the vast majority of the food retail market. The problem of farmers having their margins cut to the bone by supermarkets, and being threatened with the loss of their contracts for speaking out, has been one of the biggest sources of distress to farmers for more than two decades. Martin Lines, UK chair of the Nature Friendly Farming Network, said: “It’s very difficult for individual farmers to stand their ground against price pressures from retailers who hold all the bargaining power. There is a role for the government to play in giving farmers more power within the supply chain so they are fairly rewarded for food produced to high environmental standards. Government should intervene to ensure contracts between buyers and sellers are fair.” George Dunn, the chief executive of the Tenant Farmers Association, said: “There is significant imbalance within the supply chain with retailers and food service operators able to wield significant power within the supply chain. Down the years, there have been warnings about the sustainability of the ‘cheap food culture’ to which we have become accustomed and it seems now we are seeing the fulfilment of those past prophecies of doom. However, retailers and food service providers have the means to avoid a catastrophe by allowing their prices to increase.” Labour accused the government of letting down farmers. Jim McMahon, the shadow environment secretary, said: “Not only is the government neglecting its duty to support British farmers, leaving them exposed to undercutting through inadequate trade deals, ministers now appear to be washing their hands of that responsibility completely. Our rural businesses deserve better and it’s little wonder many are feeling completely let down by the Conservatives’ failings.” The government’s previous efforts to shift the balance of power, by installing a “groceries code adjudicator”, have had limited impact. Jo Lewis, policy director at the Soil Association, said an overhaul of the UK’s food systems was required: “Eustice is right to say farmers need to get a much fairer share of the value of the food they’re producing, but his suggestion that the solution is them ‘standing tough’ with retailers seems far-fetched. “Farmers will continue to lack power while they are forced to supply commodity crops into a globalised market for ultra-processed foods. They need infrastructure and skills support from government to help them access shorter, fairer supply chains and they need government to get real food back into shopping baskets by tackling the unhealthy takeover of ultra-processed foods with a national reduction target.” She said the government’s response to the national food strategy – which Eustice promised for this spring– would be a key test. Eustice also took a robust line on the potential for price rises caused by a shortage of migrant workers, saying that “employers need not look for cheap labour” from the EU. “There is no reason why the price of daffodils should not rise to £1.10,” he said, a reference to warnings from Cornish growers that they cannot harvest their flowers, at devastating cost to their business. Eustice cheered farmers by announcing 30% higher payments for environmental stewardship schemes, which reward them for taking basic measures to protect the environment, and there was a cautious welcome from many to his proposals for “environmental land management” contracts that will come into force in 2024, with payments to farmers for a broader range of measures, from soil nurturing and tree-planting, and providing habitats for wildlife, to floodplain and watercourse management. However, plans by the government to support rewilding through 10 to 15 large-scale pilot projects of between 500 and 5,000 hectares came under fire. Jyoti Fernandes, policy coordinator at the Landworkers’ Alliance union, representing farmworkers, said: “The danger of this approach is that many of the holdings of this size will be land owned by corporations or landed gentry, which means our public money will continue to flow to the very richest in society, while access to land will become increasingly more difficult for new entrants to farming.”",News/Environment,UK farmers sceptical after minister urges them to ‘stand ground’ on fair prices,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/06/farmers-should-stand-their-ground-with-supermarkets-on-fair-prices-minister-says
1/7/2022,"European governments are ramping up the pressure on people to get vaccinated against Covid-19 by making life progressively harder for those who have not done so, but few are opting to make jabs compulsory – and one country that plans to is now having doubts. As the Omicron variant sweeps across much of the continent, causing record infection numbers in almost a dozen countries from Finland to Greece, boosting vaccination tallies has become a priority to ease pressure on overburdened health services.  Italy, where teachers and health workers must already be vaccinated and all other employees must be jabbed or test negative to enter the workplace, this week made vaccination compulsory for about 28 million people aged over 50. “We want to slow down the curve of contagion and encourage Italians who have not yet been vaccinated to do so,” said the prime minister, Mario Draghi. “These rules aim to keep hospitals functioning well and schools and business activities open.” The new measures oblige people over 50 who do not work to get vaccinated, while from 15 February, those who do have jobs will have to show a vaccine pass to enter the workplace, removing the option of taking a coronavirus test. They follow a government decision late last month that from 10 January, a vaccine pass would be required to use public transport as well as to access hotels, restaurants and gyms – again, excluding those who can only show a negative test. The mandate makes Italy one of only three EU states to compel an entire age group to get jabbed, though several have made vaccines compulsory in high-risk sectors such as healthcare. It divided the cabinet, with the far-right League saying it had “no scientific foundation” since most people in hospital with Covid were over 60. Greece, which has also barred unvaccinated people from indoor spaces including restaurants, cinemas, museums and gyms, said in late November it would make vaccinations mandatory from 16 January for people aged 60 and over, more than half a million of whom had yet to get vaccinated. Those who fail to comply face a recurring monthly fine of €100. The prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said it was a tough decision but was needed to protect elderly people who had failed to get the jab. “It’s the price to pay for health,” he said. Syriza, the main opposition party, criticised it as being punitive and financially excessive. In Austria, however, where vaccination is due to become mandatory for everyone aged over 14 from 1 February, a political consensus around the plan has started to fray as some argue the nature of the Omicron variant has changed the situation. Gerald Gartlehner, a leading virologist and previously one of the country’s more cautious voices, said this week it was “probably time to reassess” mandatory jabs, since the new, highly transmissible variant would create unprecedented levels of immunity. In an interview just after Christmas, the federal minister for the institution, Karoline Edtstadler, also hinted a population-wide mandate may need to be rethought if data could not prove the effectiveness of available vaccines against Omicron. The Social Democrat governor of Burgenland state, Hans Peter Doskozil, said this week cross-party support for a vaccine mandate was “crumbling away at a federal level”, and several commentators have suggested the government may be quietly preparing the ground for a U-turn. The ruling three-party coalition government, however, insists it continues to favour the draft law, which needs approval only by a simple majority in the health committees of the upper and lower houses of the Austrian parliament. Sceptics say the real difficulty with compulsory vaccinations is likely to start after the law comes into effect: tracing those who decline to be jabbed would require merging two different databases, which comes with further legal and logistical obstacles. “A government that pushes to make vaccinations mandatory but cannot execute such a law makes a mockery of a general mandate”, the health spokesperson of Austria’s liberal NEOS party, Gerald Loacker, said. France’s prime minister, Jean Castex, hinted at the same concern, saying on Thursday that making vaccination compulsory would not be helpful because it was likely ultimately to create more problems than solutions. “We already have some difficulties checking health pass compliance,” Castex told French television. “Those difficulties would become even bigger if we made vaccination compulsory.” Those countries that had moved towards compulsory vaccinations had lower vaccination rates than France, he said. On Thursday, the lower house of parliament passed a bill making it obligatory to have a full course of vaccination to take a plane or long-distance train, eat in a restaurant, drink in a cafe or bar, and visit museums, the cinema and sports venues. A recent test or proof of recovery will no longer be valid. The vote, which sends the draft law to the senate, followed three days of ill-tempered debate sparked by Emmanuel Macron’s warning that he wanted to “piss off” or “put in the shit” unvaccinated people by making their lives increasingly difficult. The president’s coarse language, although widely seen as politically calculated to tap into increasing public frustration with unvaccinated people in a country where more than 90% of over-12s have received at least two doses, caused a furore. Germany’s new government has said it aims to follow Austria down the path of compulsory vaccination but has so far initiated little public debate on the question or made much headway with the necessary legal groundwork. A breakaway group of MPs from the Free Democratic party, one of the three parties in the country’s “traffic light” coalition government, on Thursday submitted a motion to reject mandatory jabs outright.",News/Society,"Vaccine mandates, fines, gym bans: how Europe hopes to persuade unjabbed",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/06/vaccine-mandates-fines-gym-bans-how-europe-hopes-to-persuade-unjabbed
1/7/2022,"Promoted to serve as a human shield for Manchester United’s unpopular American owners following the departure of his predecessor David Gill eight years ago, Ed Woodward will officially step down from his post as chief suit of the Premier League’s seventh-placed side at the end of this month. A man who seems to keep announcing his departure from Manchester United without ever actually leaving, it should come as no surprise to learn that he will continue to attend their board meetings until the end of the season but will play no part in the day-to-day running of the club. He will be replaced by Richard Arnold, a man who friend of The Fiver and football finance expert Price of Football has pointed out is cut from almost identical cloth. “Arnold is a rugby fan and Bristol Uni graduate who worked at [PricewaterhouseCoopers] who effectively replaces Ed Woodward, the rugby fan graduate from Bristol Uni who worked at [PricewaterhouseCoopers],” tweeted POF. “Expect big changes.”  Hamstrung from the get-go by the departure of Lord Ferg just a few months after he was appointed, Woodward will be forever renowned in United folklore as much for the at-one-time-or-another out-of-work managers he could have appointed but didn’t – Guardiola, Klopp, Pochettino, Tommy T and Conte – as those he shouldn’t have appointed but did. Moyes, Van Gaal, the Special One and Solskjær came and went on his watch, while the latest incumbent has apparently so displeased the dizzying array of moaning, overpaid, under-performing divas Woodward also recruited with his lack of charisma that after just a handful of games they already want him out the door. Soon after his appointment United were plunged into crisis and they remain there now that he’s announced he’s off. And yet by many accounts – almost all of them his own imparted through the medium of off-the-record briefings – he has done a tremendous job. On Mr Ed’s eight-year watch, United have failed to mount anything resembling a serious title challenge, spaffing more than a billion big ones on and at players, an astonishing number of whom failed to make anything resembling an impact. And despite his claims to the contrary, Woodward agitated more than any other big-club suit in English football for the creation of the hideously unpopular €uropean $uper £eague. For all that, it would be remiss of us not to give him credit for the good times: glory in Big Vase, the FA Cup and Coca-Cola Cup, not to mention the kind of crowd-pleasing, big-money commercial partnerships with assorted noodle, tyre, chocolate, wine and electric razor manufacturers that drive social media interaction and engagements more than a bog-standard win in Big Cup. Should his successor succeed where he failed, Woodward’s legacy will eventually be forgotten, but for now he remains still not gone. “No one should suffer discrimination because of their sexual orientation and/or their gender identity and we urge supporters not to use this chant” – Tottenham criticise homophobic chants from their fans during Wednesday’s 2-0 defeat at Chelsea.

1/7/2022,"Levels of flu remain low in the UK despite Covid cases rising considerably over Christmas and the new year, official data shows. The Omicron variant of coronavirus has spread rapidly around the UK, leading to a sharp rise in infections and, subsequently, hospitalisations. According to figures from the Office for National Statistics released on Wednesday, one in 15 people in England had Covid in the week ending 31 December, rising to one in 10 in London.  However, according to the latest report from the UK Health Security Agency, while Covid case rates rose considerably in England towards the end of 2021 and the start of the new year – particularly in the north-east of England and in white ethnic groups – flu remains at low levels, according to metrics including hospital admissions and GP influenza-like illness consultation rates. Experts previously raised concerns that countries including the UK could face a difficult winter with flu and Covid in circulation. A key issue, they noted, was that measures to tackle Covid led to very low prevalence of flu – a situation that was likely to mean population immunity had dropped. Cases of people being infected with flu and coronavirus at the same time have been reported in a number of countries and has led to the rise of the term “flurona”, although the moniker is misleading as it erroneously implies the two viruses have merged. Prof Beate Kampmann, the director of the vaccine centre at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said it was possible for people to carry more than one virus in their noses at any given time. “This is nothing new and it happens regularly with other viruses that give us a runny nose – like rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),” she said. Kampmann added that with an overlap in symptoms between influenza and Covid, patients who required admission or were sick with a flu-like illness were tested for a whole panel of viruses. “We are now in the traditional winter flu season and Omicron is also still everywhere, hence as we screen with very sensitive tests we will see a lot more of both viruses in the same person,” she said. “Whether this will make people more sick is another question.” The chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, Dr Jenny Harries, said in October that early evidence suggested people who had a simultaneous infection of flu and Covid were twice as likely to die as those who had only coronavirus. But Kampmann stressed that this was when the Delta variant was prevalent. The latest data suggests the risk of hospital admission for Omicron is approximately a third of that for Delta. Kampmann added that there were effective vaccines against the severe manifestations of seasonal flu and Covid. Indeed, in an attempt to tackle the potential impact of flu and Covid and reduce pressures on the NHS, the UK rolled out its largest flu vaccination programme in its history last year, offering free flu vaccines to more than 35 million people, with many receiving it at the same time as a Covid jab. According to the latest data from the UKHSA, flu vaccine uptake has reached 81.4% in people aged 65 years and over, with uptake of Covid booster vaccines even higher, reaching 91.1% in those aged 75 to 80. Kampmann said the very important public health message was to get vaccinated against flu and Covid. “This is particularly important for pregnant women, as both seasonal flu and Covid-19 vaccines are recommended in pregnancy, given that flu can also make pregnant women quite sick,” she said. “However, carrying both viruses does not necessarily mean more sickness per se.”",News/Society,"Flu levels remain low in UK despite spread of Omicron, data shows",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/06/flu-levels-remain-low-in-uk-despite-spread-of-omicron-data-shows
1/7/2022,"At first glance the Northumberland village of Allendale, with its pub and post office and random parking, is like hundreds of sleepy, charming villages across the UK. It’s the Dalek that suggests something out of the ordinary. Behind the Dalek is a four-storey Georgian townhouse. In the cellar of the house is a remarkable and unlikely collection of more than 200 costumes, props and artwork telling classic sci-fi stories of Doctor Who, Blake’s 7, Star Trek, Flash Gordon, Marvel and many more.  Together they make up the collection of one of Britain’s most eccentric small museums, one of many to be effectively forced into hibernation because of the pandemic. Most are run on a shoestring. Not all of them will reopen. But Neil Cole, a teacher and creator of the Museum of Classic Sci-Fi, is cheerfully optimistic about the future. “The closure has allowed me to restructure the museum and create more space,” he says. “In a way it has been useful because it has given me time I don’t normally get. “I’ve made the best of it. I don’t have a lot of money but I have got a lot of energy and I do everything myself.” Cole’s determination to create a museum in his house dates back to childhood. “I remember being five and going to Blackpool and there on the front was a Tardis,” he said. “It was the BBC official exhibition.” Inside were the monsters he’d seen on the TV, and it was fabulous. “It was like a blurring of reality and fiction. From that moment on, I just wanted to do something like it. That was the kick-off and it never left.” Like many, Cole’s entry to sci-fi was watching Doctor Who. For him it was Jon Pertwee (just) and Tom Baker. Some of his earliest memories are “sitting down at Saturday teatime, waiting for the Grandstand titles to finish. Then there was Basil Brush, which was cool, but it was Doctor Who I was waiting for.” He learned to read through Marvel comics, he said, and would scour local paper TV listings for any old sci-fi films on in the dead of night. “My dad was very good with that, he’d let me stay up.” It took Cole about five years to convert a rotting, flooded cellar into a space suitable for a museum. Every costume or prop or piece of memorabilia he has collected over the years has its own story. What looks like a drab, nothing-to-it, cheesecloth dress is actually hugely exciting and significant, Cole insisted, because it is a costume from the 1976 Doctor Who story The Brain of Morbius. It was worn by one of the main characters, Ohica, and was the first costume Cole bought. “I had a motorcycle which I was going to university on and I sold it to get that. I ended [up] having to get the bus but it was worth it … to me this was a bit of history, it has a bit of magic.” He has many benefactors and supporters, pointing to a robot mummy’s head from the 1975 Doctor Who serial Pyramids of Mars, which in the highly specialised world of Doctor Who collecting is something of a zinger. It is the only surviving head and was donated to him because he would put it on display and not sell it. “I got it from the son of the milkman who was given it as the BBC were chucking it in a skip in the 1970s.” Each object comes with detailed information which geeky visitors tend to appreciate. A costume from season four of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine for the Rasiinian ambassador Runepp was designed by a fan as a competition prize. “They fabricated his design and the fan ended up on the set in his own costume,” said Cole. “How cool is that?” The museum has become embedded in village life and has survived a run-in with county council planners who, in 2019, objected to Cole’s homemade Dalek standing proudly outside the museum. The dispute came after Cole thought he had won everyone round. He had restored a ramshackle wreck of a building and was creating something different. “I said: ‘Look, I know it sounds mad but you are going to get new tourists. You’ve got your walkers, you’ve got your lead history buffs, you’ve got your cyclists. Now you’ll get your film buffs, your comic readers.’” The story went around the world and the council backed down. The museum recently had a grand reopening whose guests included Sophie Aldred, who played the Doctor’s companion Ace in the 1980s, and is filming a documentary about the museum. The whole weekend was a great occasion, said Cole. “The museum has brought so much into the village. We had [the Daleks’ fictional creator] Davros in the Co-op.”",Arts/Culture,The Doctor Who treasure trove in a Northumberland village cellar,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/06/the-doctor-who-treasure-trove-in-a-northumberland-village-cellar
1/7/2022,"On Wednesday evening, Stephen Colbert anticipated Thursday’s first anniversary of the 6 January attack of the Capitol, “that horrible day when millions of Americans stared at the TV in shock, and grief, and said, ‘Ah crap, is that Uncle Dave?’”  The Late Show host, one of the few not still on vacation or out with Covid, zeroed in on the latest revelation from the House select committee investigating the attempted coup. Earlier this week, the committee requested that Sean Hannity cooperate with the investigation, citing texts between the Fox News host and the White House which suggest advance knowledge of Trump’s planning for 6 January. According to publicly released documents, on 21 December 2020, Hannity texted the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows: “I do NOT see January 6 happening the way he is being told.” “So Hannity clearly knew what was coming,” Colbert said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if the former president planned this coup with the knowledge of the entire Fox News lineup, including the commercials. “Apparently, Hannity saw some downsides to destroying our system of representative government,” Colbert added, pointing to a text from 5 January, in which Hannity told Meadows he was “very worried about the next 48 hours”. “So he either had advance knowledge of the plot, or he had just eaten three Taco Bell Burrito Supremes,” Colbert joked. “Either way, he knew the next 48 hours were going to bring chaos.” The Biden administration plans to acknowledge the anniversary with solemnity, including a prayer service. Trump, meanwhile, planned remarks doubling down on his election lies during the Capitol prayer service to “counterprogram” the remembrance events. “Yeah, you can’t let remembrance events go on without counter-programming!” Colbert mocked. “Same reason at a funeral, you’ve got to bring out an insult comic for the people who are glad the guy’s dead.” On Monday, Trump cancelled the event, citing “the total bias and dishonesty of the January 6 Unselect Committee of Democrats”, among the other usual targets, and punted his rant to a rally next weekend in Arizona. “It makes sense that he’s moving it from Mar-a-Lago to Arizona, considering their state motto: Arizona, America’s backup Florida,” Colbert joked. On the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon checked in on the latest guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which advised those who had isolated for five days with Covid to take a rapid test if one is accessible. “You can read all about it in this month’s issue of Unhelpful Advice magazine,” Fallon joked. “That’s right, another update from the CDC,” he continued. “Even Dr Fauci is like ‘Oh, I muted those months ago.’ “At this point, the CDC is like that annoying co-worker who emails you every five minutes like ‘just following up on this. Just bumping this up, guys,’” he added. Fallon also lamented the first reports of so-called “flurona”, a combination of the flu and the coronavirus (or just having both at the same time). “Americans are so stressed they started smoking methajuana,” he quipped. And in lighter news, New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, permanently legalized to-go cocktails in New York City this week. “Then she said the same exact thing five minutes later,” Fallon joked. “New Yorkers are like, ‘Look, governor, if you think you’re just going to win us over – what? We love you.’”",Arts/Culture,Colbert: Sean Hannity ‘clearly knew what was coming’ on 6 January,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/06/stephen-colbert-sean-hannity-capitol-attack-late-show-recap
1/7/2022,"The verdict in the trial of the Colston Four has little to do with efforts to tackle racism in Bristol, the city’s mayor has said as he defended himself against criticism for not acting sooner over the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston. Speaking to the Guardian after three men and a woman were cleared of criminal damage in toppling the statue in 2020, Marvin Rees said the fate of the statue was symbolic but he had “no reaction” to the verdict.  “More power to them as individuals,” Rees said. “I hope they have good lives and all the rest of it, but what happened to them in court really has very little to do with what we are trying to get done in the city. “My business in Bristol is about holding the city together and tackling racism. Whatever happened to the individuals who pulled the statue down has very little to do with the drive to tackle race and class inequality in the city.” On Wednesday a jury acquitted Jake Skuse, Rhian Graham, Milo Ponsford and Sage Willoughby, who played key roles in bringing down the statue of the 17th-century slave trader at a Black Lives Matter protest and pushing it into the River Avon. Rees and the council had been criticised for not acting more quickly on the Colston statue. The council’s head of culture, Jon Finch, who attended court to give evidence for the prosecution, acknowledged it caused offence but said no official action was under way at the time of the toppling. Rees became the first directly elected black mayor in Europe in 2016. Taking office amid a toxic debate around Brexit, he said he could not afford to waste political capital to prioritise taking down a statue. He said: “What [then] happens to my political capital to actually take action on employment, housing, education? What happens? It evaporates. So you could end up sacrificing real substantial politics for symbolic politics. “I think also what could have happened [is that] you could have scared people and made it very difficult for black people who come after me to get elected. So there’s a context to this that people who talk from privilege would not understand, that really matters and is getting lost in the sensation.” Before the toppling of Colston, the big debate around the slave trader’s legacy in Bristol had been about Colston Hall, the city’s most important arts venue, Rees said. Efforts had been focused there and a name change agreed, only to be delayed by the coronavirus pandemic. “So factually it’s incorrect to say nothing was happening. We may not have prioritised the statue at that particular point in time but that’s a strategic decision of what to focus our energies on,” he said. Rees denied claims that the council supported the prosecution. “We were asked to give a factual account of what happened and we provided it,” he said. “And our head of culture was called as a witness for one side or the other, of course he’s going to turn up. What’s he going to do? Not go?” Ultimately, Rees said, he was happy that the statue of Colston was no longer there. “I’m glad there is no statue of a slaver up in the city,” he said. “My great-great-great-great-grandfather, I found out, was hung by the British for participating in the Morant Bay rebellion; my family may have been owned by Colston, transported by Colston, right? “I’m a descendant of enslaved Africans, I don’t want the statue up in the middle of the city. But that’s a discussion.”",News/UK news,Bristol mayor: Colston Four verdict has little to do with drive to tackle racism,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/06/bristol-mayor-colston-four-verdict-has-little-to-do-with-drive-to-tackle-racism
