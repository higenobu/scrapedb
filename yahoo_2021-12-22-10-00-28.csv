12/22/2021,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — An advertising-technology billionaire has formally resigned his membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and rebuked the faith over social issues and LGBTQ rights in an unusual public move. Jeff T. Green has pledged to donate 90% of his estimated $5 billion advertising-technology wealth, starting with a donation to a LGBTQ-rights group in the state, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. In an unusual public step, Green said in a Monday resignation letter to church President Russell M. Nelson that he hasn’t been active in the faith widely known as Mormon for more than a decade but wanted to make his departure official and remove his name from membership records. “I believe the Mormon church has hindered global progress in women’s rights, civil rights and racial equality, and LGBTQ+ rights,” he wrote. Eleven family members and a friend formally resigned along with him. He will donate $600,000 to the group Equality Utah. The church didn't immediately return a message from The Associated Press seeking comment Tuesday, but in recent years has shown a willingness to engage on LGBTQ rights that is unusual for a conservative faith. While it maintains its opposition to same-sex marriage, the faith didn't block a 2019 ban on so-called conversion therapy in Utah and in November high-ranking leader Dallin Oaks said in a speech that religious rights and LGBTQ rights can coexist. Green, for his part, said most church members “are good people trying to do right,” but he also worries about the faith’s transparency around its history and finances. Green, 44, now lives in Southern California. He is the CEO and chairman of The Trade Desk, an advertising technology firm he founded in 2009. He also mentioned concerns about a $100 billion investment portfolio held by the faith. It was the subject of an Internal Revenue Service whistleblower complaint in 2019, from a former employee who charged the church had improperly built it up using member donations that are supposed to go to charitable causes. Leaders have defended how the church uses and invests member donations, saying most is used for operational and humanitarian needs, but a portion is safeguarded to build a reserve for the future. The faith annually spends about $1 billion on humanitarian and welfare aid, leaders have said. The church has also come under criticism for conservative social positions. Women do not hold the priesthood in the faith, and Black men could not until the 1970s. In recent years, though, the faith has worked with the NAACP and donated nearly $10 million for initiatives to help Black Americans. It has also worked with Equality Utah to pass a state LGBTQ nondiscrimination law, with religious exemptions. Another prominent onetime Latter-day Saint sued the faith this year, accusing it of fraud and seeking to recover millions of dollars in contributions. James Huntsman is a member of one of Utah’s most prominent families and brother of a former governor. The suit was later tossed out.",U.S./Associated Press,"Mormon billionaire leaves faith, rebukes LGBTQ rights stance",https://news.yahoo.com/mormon-billionaire-resigns-rebukes-faith-231958255.html
12/22/2021,"Donald Trump appears to have flown on Jeffrey Epstein’s private jets six more times than was previously known, according to flight logs released as evidence in Ghislaine Maxwell’s trial. Previous disclosures of portions of Epstein’s flight log have shown world leaders, billionaires and celebrities among the many passengers who have flown on Epstein’s private jets. The new log released as evidence in Maxwell’s case stretches back earlier than previous releases. Decades before he became president, Trump flew four times in 1993, once in 1994 and once in 1995, in addition to a flight in 1997 that had been documented in portions of the flight log previously released. The flights were all between Palm Beach and New York City airports, with the June 1994 flight stopping at Ronald Reagan Washington Washington National Airport between Palm Beach and New York. The challenge presented to Ghislaine Maxwell jury: 4 accusers and a wide array of charges A woman named Marla, apparently Trump’s then-wife Marla Maples, is listed as joining him on the June 1994 flight, along with a Tiffany, apparently their then-infant daughter, and a nanny. Trump’s son Eric is listed as joining him on an August 1995 flight between Palm Beach and New York. That’s still fewer than former President Bill Clinton, who flew on Epstein’s jets on at least nine different dates according to the flight records released as evidence, and reportedly far more times than that. The extent of Clinton’s travel on Epstein flights was already reported, however. Neither of the two former presidents have been accused of sexual misconduct involving Epstein, who died in prison a month after his arrest on sex-trafficking charges in 2019 Trump and Clinton aren’t the only notable names included in the 118-page log, which includes flights between April 1991 and January 2006. The log also includes two previously undisclosed flights in February 1994 on which a passenger identified as Bobby Kennedy Jr., is listed, a previously undisclosed April 1994 flight with former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell and several previously undisclosed flights involving famed violinist Itzhak Perlman. Epstein and Trump were friends in the late 1980s and early 1990s, although the relationship reportedly soured after they both vied for the same pricey Palm Beach property and after Epstein hit on the teenage daughter of a member of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach. None of the above listed passengers could be reached for comment Monday. The Manhattan sex-trafficking trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s former girlfriend, was placed in the hands of the jury Monday.",U.S./Miami Herald,"Maxwell case logs show how frequently Trump flew on Epstein jets; Bill Clinton, too",https://news.yahoo.com/maxwell-case-logs-show-frequently-224123780.html

12/22/2021,"BEIJING (AP) — An Asian American who is one of the biggest pop stars in China apologized to his family and fans on Monday and said he will take a break from performing after a public dispute on social media with his ex-wife, who accused him of infidelity and hiring prostitutes. The dayslong back-and-forth has riveted fans of Wang Leehom, who is popular across the Chinese-speaking world and has acted in movies including “Lust, Caution” in 2007. The scandal was the top trending topic on the Chinese social media site Weibo, with many blaming and criticizing him. He appeared to be trying to end the burgeoning public relations disaster with his apology to his parents, ex-wife and their children. “I failed to manage my marriage properly and caused trouble for my family. I didn’t give the public the image an idol should have,” he wrote. “This is all my fault."" The social media war began after Wang, in an online post last week, confirmed speculation that he and his wife had divorced. Her accusations contrasted with the wholesome image he had cultivated as a husband and father.  The singer was born in Rochester, N.Y., to parents from Taiwan, according to online biographies.

12/22/2021,"Money, it seems, really can’t buy love. But in the case of Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, and his sixth wife, Princess Haya, it can sure buy a lot of other stuff, including the silence of her secret lover. In what is being dubbed as the biggest divorce settlement in U.K. history, the newly divorced sheikh was ordered to pay some $734 million to his estranged wife in a case that has lifted the veil on what the super rich do in their spare time. Testimony, which can only now be reported under British court rules, suggests that Princess Haya, 47, who happens to be the sister of King Abdullah II of Jordan, “borrowed” a cool $7.5 million from her then 10-year-old daughter’s trust account to pay off her bodyguard, a former British soldier, with whom she was conducting an illicit affair. The princess’ security team had apparently blackmailed her to keep the tryst under wraps. “I was scared and that was the money available in that account,” the princess told the court, according to British press accounts published Tuesday. The Ruler of Dubai Condemns His Runaway Wife, Princess Haya, on Instagram—in a Poem The sheikh, 72, divorced his youngest wife when he discovered the affair, which led to the court proceedings. Calling their life “truly opulent” and remarking on the “unprecedented standard of living enjoyed by these parties,” the presiding judge ordered the wealthy ruler to pay the princess millions to continue to enjoy the lifestyle to which she and her children have become accustomed. A large part of the record settlement is for security for the princess and her children—to protect them from the sheikh, who apparently considered her infidelity a capital offense. “Most importantly in this regard, and absolutely uniquely, the main threat they face is from HH himself not from outside sources,” the judge said, referring to the sheikh as His Highness. “This is compounded by the full weight of the state that he has available to him as seen by his ability to make use of the Pegasus software, which is only available to governments.” The sheikh used the software to hack the phones of the princess and her lawyers. The judge also scolded the blackmailers, who have not yet been charged with any crime, saying, “This was clearly a most unsatisfactory episode. I realize I have not heard from the alleged blackmailers, but nobody should be blackmailed and HRH must have been very frightened at this point.” The couple separated in 2019 when the sheikh discovered his wife’s infidelity. Haya took the kids, now age 14 and 9, to the U.K. While married, the ruler provided the princess with an annual $110 million budget for household expenses and nearly $12 million in allowance for each of the children. Haya originally asked for nearly $2 billion in maintenance. The court saw holiday snapshots of the family on their $400 million super yacht, in addition to vacation pictures from their collection of villas and estates as well as shots of their custom-made Boeing 747 and matching helicopters, all staffed by around 80 servants. The court was also told how one summer, the family of four spent more than $2 million—on strawberries. Dubai Ruler Sheikh Mohammed Hacked Wife’s Phone With Pegasus Spyware, London Court Finds While the high-dollar payout would surely have satisfied most divorcées—especially considering the circumstances of her infidelity—Haya was said to be disappointed not to have her haute couture wardrobe, valued at about $110 million, or her $26 million jewelry collection returned to her from Dubai. The court was shown a photo of her walk-in jewelry vault, which she said had been stripped of the good stuff, leaving around $25,000 in “costume jewelry” that the judge did offer to order returned. According to press reports, he asked her if there would be “any point” to do so, to which she said, simply, “no.” She will also not get her stable of racehorses, but instead was awarded some $6.6 million to “buy a few reasonable horses and run them for several years.” Her lawyers had insisted that travel funds be allocated for the children, which the court awarded to the tune of $7 million a year, plus an additional $1.3 million for unspecified “leisure” activities. An additional $250,000 was earmarked for animals, including horses and ponies, and $130,000 for the children’s private tutors. A request for the couple’s son Zayed, age 9, for money to purchase three new automobiles—in addition to the one he already owns—was denied, with the judge telling the princess, “I do consider it an artificial edifice to talk of children of the ages of these children owning motor vehicles. Moreover, Zayed’s precious motor vehicle has now finally been returned to him.” Admitting that the circumstances of the divorce were highly unusual, the judge applauded the princess for wanting her children to have a “normal life,” adding that in his judgment he did his best “to a conclusion as to what is reasonable while remembering that the exceptional wealth and remarkable standard of living enjoyed by these children during the marriage takes this case entirely out of the ordinary.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

 Japan carried out its first set of executions under Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida Tuesday as three death row prisoners were executed, CNN reported. The execution was the first in Japan since 2019, when a man was executed for murdering his family in 2003, according to CBS News. In 2018, 15 people were executed in the country, including 13 cult members who were convicted for a deadly 1995 gassing attack in Tokyo's subways. The three men who were hanged Tuesday were Yasutaka Fujishiro, 65, who was convicted for murdering seven people in 2004, and Tomoaki Takanezawa, 54, and Mitsunori Onogawa, 44, who were convicted for killing two employees in a game parlor in 2003, reported CNN, citing the Japanese Justice Ministry. ""These are extremely brutal cases, taking precious lives for selfish reasons. I think these are terrible incidents not only for victims who lost their lives but also for bereaved families,"" Justice Minister Yoshihisa Furukawa stated at a news conference, according to CNN. ""As justice minister, I authorized their executions after giving extremely careful considerations again and again,"" Furukawa added. The prisoners were executed by hanging, which is how all executions are carried out in Japan, according to CNN. The men hanged on Tuesday were given short notice of their executions' timeline, according to CBS. According to the outlet, Furukawa defended the short notice, citing a ""serious mental impact,"" if they had known further in advance. The families of those executed in Japan are typically notified even later, per CNN, learning of their relatives' hangings only after they are already deceased. ""The recent appointment of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida was a chance for progress on human rights in Japan. But today's abhorrent resumption of executions is a damning indictment of this government's lack of respect for the right to life,"" said Amnesty International Death Penalty Adviser Chiara Sangiorgio in response to Japan's executions, according to CNN. There are currently 107 people on Japan's death row, CBS News reported. There are very few democratic nations that still enforce capital punishment, according to Amnesty International, an organization that advocates for human rights and opposes the death penalty.

12/22/2021,"By Linda So and Jason Szep (Reuters) - A member of Donald Trump’s 2020 presidential campaign arranged and participated in a meeting at which a Georgia election worker says she was pressed by a Chicago publicist to falsely admit voting fraud. The revelation directly ties a senior figure in the former president’s political operation to an extraordinary late-night Jan. 4 meeting in which a $16-an-hour election worker faced pressure to implicate herself in a baseless conspiracy theory, stoked by Trump himself, as he sought to overturn his Georgia election loss. Harrison Floyd - who was executive director of a national campaign coalition called Black Voices for Trump in 2020 - told Reuters on Monday that he asked Chicago publicist Trevian Kutti to visit the Atlanta area to speak with 62-year-old temporary election worker Ruby Freeman. Floyd said he then participated by phone in a meeting Kutti held with Freeman at a police station in Georgia’s Cobb County. Kutti was accompanied at the meeting by another Trump campaign figure: Garrison Douglas, who was a Georgia leader in Black Voices for Trump during the campaign and now works as a Republican Party spokesperson in the state. Douglas confirmed to Reuters that he was present at the meeting. Floyd said he recruited Douglas and Kutti because he was unable to attend himself. In a statement to Reuters on Monday, Douglas said: ""On January 4th, I was unemployed and received a call to serve as a volunteer driver, as I had many times in the past. I had no involvement in the meeting beyond the task of driving."" In a phone interview Monday, Floyd said he was asked if he’d be willing to set up the meeting by a man he described as a chaplain with “connections” in federal law enforcement. He declined to name the clergyman or to detail what those connections involved. Floyd said the chaplain, who is white, wanted him to approach Freeman, who is Black, to discuss an immunity deal for her, out of a belief that she would not trust a white stranger. Floyd, Douglas and Kutti are Black. Floyd said that he had left his role in the Trump campaign before the Jan. 4 meeting. Trump himself “never asked me to go” to Georgia, he said, and board members of the Black Voices for Trump group “had no involvement in this.” Floyd said he arranged the meeting in an effort to help Freeman. He said he himself believed she was seeking assistance, including immunity from prosecution over claims from the Trump camp that she had committed voting fraud. Freeman, through a spokesperson, said she never reached out to anyone to seek immunity. Her lawyer, Von DuBose, declined to comment further. A former Justice Department official in Georgia confirmed that state and federal investigators concluded in December 2020 that there was no evidence Freeman committed fraud. As a result, the department never considered offering her immunity, said the official, who had direct knowledge of a Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiry into Trump’s Georgia election-fraud claims. Floyd did not directly answer when asked whether Freeman requested immunity at the meeting. He said Freeman wasn’t willing to “put anything down on paper,” so he had nothing to “run up the flagpole,” referring to his more senior contacts in Trump’s political operation. Asked if he told Freeman that he was a Trump campaign official, Floyd said: “I’m pretty certain that I made it clear.” He referred to a comment by Kutti, captured on police bodycam video, telling Freeman that “federal people” were involved in offering her help. “Who was the current president at that time? President Trump,” said Floyd. “If she’s there saying, I’m here to connect you with federal people, well, that’s people in the Trump administration.” Freeman told Reuters in a previous interview that she did not know Kutti was a Trump supporter until after the meeting at the police station, when Freeman researched the publicist online. Kutti and her lawyer, Robert Barker, did not respond to requests for comment. In an Instagram post last Monday, Kutti denied pressuring Freeman to falsely admit fraud. A spokesperson for Trump did not respond to requests for comment for this story. The Republican National Committee, where Douglas is now employed, did not respond to a request for comment. The involvement of Trump campaign figures in the meeting with Freeman highlights the aggressive and unusual steps taken by backers of the former president to help reverse his loss in the once-reliably Republican state. Beginning on Dec. 3 last year, Trump and his allies falsely claimed that video of vote-counting at Atlanta’s State Farm Arena proved that Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, another Fulton County election worker, committed election fraud. They alleged the mother and daughter illegally tabulated mysterious ballots from a suitcase multiple times to create 18,000 fraudulent votes - enough to cause Trump to lose the Georgia election. State and county officials quickly disproved that allegation. The false claims sparked months of death threats and other harassment by Trump supporters toward Freeman and her daughter. The district attorney in Fulton County, where Freeman worked on the ballot count, is conducting a criminal investigation into Trump’s alleged interference in Georgia’s election. The district attorney, Fani Willis, has said the probe would examine a now-famous call in which Trump pressed Georgia officials to “find” him enough votes to overturn his loss in the state. On the call, Trump singled out Freeman by name 18 times, calling her a “professional vote scammer,” a “hustler” and a “known political operative” who “stuffed the ballot boxes.” That call came two days before Floyd dispatched Kutti and Douglas to visit Freeman. BLACK VOICES FOR TRUMP Floyd and Douglas were part of a small but active base of Black political support for Trump. Kutti has worked as a publicist in the music industry and managed the campaign for an unsuccessful Georgia Republican candidate for the U.S. House. Floyd launched a bid for Georgia’s 7th District congressional seat in May 2019 but dropped out less than a month later. That July, he joined Black Voices for Trump as executive director, a position he says he held until Nov. 15, 2020. Trump campaign records show that Black Voices for Trump was an official part of the campaign, much like other groups that target specific voters, such as Latinos for Trump and Evangelicals for Trump. The group’s archived website said the site was ""Paid for by Donald J. Trump for President, Inc."" Floyd told Reuters that he had an office in the same building as the core campaign in Virginia, where he said he worked on the same floor as the most senior staffers of Trump’s political operation. Trump called out Floyd for applause while speaking before a crowd at a rally for the group at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta in November 2019. “We’re delighted to be joined by Harrison Floyd of our Black Voices coalition,” the president said. “Where’s Harrison? Where’s Harrison?” Since April of this year, Floyd has worked as a managing partner at Commonwealth Holdings International, a Washington-based investment firm that specializes in helping clients invest in cryptocurrencies, according to the firm’s webpage and Floyd’s LinkedIn page. Floyd served in the U.S. Marine Corps for nearly 11 years ending in 2014, including stints as a machine gunner, a martial arts trainer, and an information operations planner, his LinkedIn page shows. As a spokesperson for the Republican National Committee (RNC), the party’s national organizing body, Douglas regularly posts blog items on the RNC website. He has used that platform to applaud a Republican-backed election law in Georgia that the Justice Department says is “discriminatory” against Black voters. Douglas countered in an RNC blog post that the law, passed this year, “makes it easier to vote and harder to cheat.” During the 2020 campaign, Douglas was active in Georgia for Black Voices for Trump, according to a Reuters review of his social media posts between August and November of last year. At an event on Aug. 1, 2020, promoted by the Fayette County Republican Party, Douglas introduced himself as the “regional engagement coordinator for Trump victory” and said he was helping to lead Black Voices for Trump in Georgia. Kutti, a Chicago publicist, has said her clients have included rap star Kanye West; a West spokesperson says Kutti wasn’t associated with the rapper at the time of the Freeman meeting. Kutti was a supporter of Black Voices for Trump, her social media history shows. On Dec. 5, 2020, more than a month after Election Day, she posted a photo on Instagram showing her holding a “Black Voices for Trump” sign at a Trump rally in Valdosta, Georgia. At that rally, Trump played snippets of the State Farm Arena surveillance video of Freeman and her daughter on a giant screen. The footage, he said, revealed a “crime” committed by “Democrat workers.” TIME RUNNING OUT BEFORE JAN. 6 The mission for which Floyd recruited Kutti and Douglas came on Jan. 4 - at the height of Trump’s efforts to overturn the November election, and two days before the U.S. Capitol riots on Jan. 6, the day that Congress met to certify Democrat Joe Biden’s election victory. In an interview with Reuters, Floyd described a fevered atmosphere of allegations involving Freeman in December. At the time, Trump and his lawyers were continuing to press false claims that the election had been stolen. Floyd said he received calls from “across the country” from people saying they could arrange immunity for Freeman if she were to confess to election fraud. “Some of those phone calls that I mentioned were from lawyers and attorneys who were saying, ‘Is this true? Does she really want immunity?’” He declined to identify those attorneys. Asked how he knew Freeman wanted immunity, Floyd cited “a lot of chatter and discussion on the internet … People were saying, ‘We're hearing that this is what she wanted,’” he said. “But no one could confirm anything.” When Floyd spoke with Freeman by speakerphone at the precinct late on Jan. 4, he told Reuters, he believed time was running out to arrange a deal because the election would soon be certified on Jan. 6. “If Ms. Freeman wanted to get a message to the president and wanted immunity,” Floyd said, “that’s really important to get to the right people before an election is certified.” Floyd said he reached out to Kutti and Douglas to approach Freeman. “I had spoken to some people that I knew and made arrangements for and secured a place where Ms. Freeman could go,” he said, “a place where no one would know that she was there, and no one would harass her there.” ‘WERE THOSE HONEST BALLOTS?’ Kutti showed up uninvited at Freeman’s door at about 8:30 p.m. on Jan. 4, police records show. As Reuters reported earlier this month, Freeman told police that during that night’s encounter, Kutti tried to get her to falsely implicate herself in voting fraud. A Cobb County Police report identified Kutti as an “alleged Trump supporter who attempted to get Ms. Freeman to make false claims about the ballot counting.” Freeman, who’d been subjected to threats, was wary of strangers but wanted to hear out Kutti, so she asked the police to send an officer to watch over them. According to the police report, Kutti told the responding officer that she had been sent by a “high-profile individual” and that Freeman was in unspecified danger, “due to the election.” Kutti told the officer that Freeman had just 48 hours to “get ahead of the issue” before unknown people were going to show up at her home. The officer suggested that the two women meet at the police station, which they did. At the precinct, Douglas sat with Kutti and Freeman as the two women talked in the corner of a room, police bodycam footage shows. After a few minutes, Kutti put Floyd on the speakerphone. Freeman initially told Reuters she thought Floyd’s name was “Harrison Ford.” The news organization later determined that Kutti had introduced the man on the speakerphone as Harrison “Floyd.” That conclusion was backed by an analysis by an outside forensic expert, Focal Forensics, of that portion of their conversation, which was captured on a police officer’s body camera. After Reuters presented this finding to Floyd, he confirmed it was him. As the meeting began, the footage shows, Kutti told Freeman: “You are a loose end for a party that needs to tidy up.” Floyd came on via speakerphone, and the meeting continued for another hour. Large portions of the bodycam audio are not clearly audible, because the officer stepped further away from the conversation at Kutti’s request. Some details can be heard, however. Floyd asked Freeman about what was in the ballot boxes she handled on election night. He asked her if she needed “to know what was already on those ballots inside those ballot boxes?” Freeman responded: “No, we don’t look at them. I couldn’t tell you who had the most, who had the least.” “So let me ask you this,” Floyd said. “Were those honest ballots?” Freeman responded: “Yeah,” and then went into a detailed explanation of the process for handling and counting the ballots. She said the ballots are in sealed envelopes, so it’s impossible to know which candidate was picked by the voter. “Democrat or Republican,” she said, “you don’t know that.” ‘MY NAME NEEDS TO BE CLEARED’ In his interview Monday, Floyd said the meeting was arranged in part to help Freeman cut an immunity deal. Freeman is heard on the recording saying she needs a lawyer, but for a different reason: to prove her innocence. In the meeting, Freeman mentioned that Fulton County officials had publicly cleared her of any ballot fraud. But she expressed worry about another false accusation that she had done something untoward with USB drives used in the vote-counting. Trump’s lawyer, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, had publicly accused Freeman and her daughter of manipulating vote totals while passing USB drives between them, “as if they’re vials of heroin and cocaine” - again, falsely asserting the State Farm Arena video showed a crime. Freeman told Kutti and Floyd that the USB allegations had been circulated on YouTube, the bodycam footage shows. “That’s why I want an attorney,” Freeman said, “because I know my name needs to be cleared.” After striking out with Freeman that night, Floyd said, there was one more communication with her, which he declined to detail, and then the pursuit was dropped. In hindsight, Floyd said, “that initial approach in the police station could have and should have been done better.” (Reporting by Linda So and Jason Szep; additional reporting by Joseph Tanfani and Nathan Layne; editing by Brian Thevenot)",Politics/Reuters,Special Report: Trump campaign official set up meeting where Georgia election worker was pressured,https://news.yahoo.com/special-report-trump-campaign-official-160816866.html

12/22/2021,"A well-preserved dinosaur embryo has been found inside a fossilized egg. The fossilized dinosaur embryo came from Ganzhou, Jiangxi Province in southern China and was acquired by researchers in 2000. Researchers at Yingliang Group, a company that mines stones, suspected it contained egg fossils, but put it in storage for 10 years, according to a news release. When construction began on Yingliang Stone Natural History Museum, boxes of unearthed fossils were sorted through. ""Museum staff identified them as dinosaur eggs and saw some bones on the broken cross section of one of the eggs,"" Lida Xing of China University of Geosciences, Beijing, said in a news release. A embryo was found hidden within, which they named ""Baby Yingliang."" The embryo is that of the bird-like oviraptorosaurs, part of the theropod group. Theropod means ""beast foot,"" but theropod feet usually resembled those of birds. Birds are descended from one lineage of small theropods. In studying the embryo, researchers found the dinosaur took on a distinctive tucking posture before hatching, which had been considered unique to birds. The study is published in the iScience journal. Researchers say this behavior may have evolved through non-avian theropods. ""Most known non-avian dinosaur embryos are incomplete with skeletons disarticulated,"" said Waisum Maof the University of Birmingham, U.K. ""We were surprised to see this embryo beautifully preserved inside a dinosaur egg, lying in a bird-like posture. This posture had not been recognized in non-avian dinosaurs before."" While fossilized dinosaur eggs have been found during the last 100 years, discovering a well-preserved embryo is very rare, the researchers said in the release. The embryo's posture was not previously seen in non-avian dinosaur, which is ""especially notable because it's reminiscent of a late-stage modern bird embryo."" The researchers will continue to study the rare specimen in even more depth. They will attempt to image its internal anatomy. Some of its body parts are still covered in rocks. Their findings can also be used in more studies of fossil embryos.

12/22/2021,"Before the COVID-19 pandemic, a sore throat or runny nose likely meant you were suffering from a cold — and some rest and fluids would help you get back to your regular self within a few days. However, with COVID-19 symptoms overlapping with the cold and flu, the diagnosis is not as clear based on symptoms alone. To add to the confusion, there's a new COVID-19 variant. Cases linked to the Omicron variant are soaring around the world as researchers race to find out more about the new strain. Omicron is a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 and was first reported to the World Health Organization on Nov. 24 after it was detected in South Africa. It has since spread to multiple countries, including Canada. Omicron has been classified as a variant of concern by the WHO and the organization says it is coordinating with many researchers around the world to better understand the new strain. Omicron has a large number of mutations, which could mean the virus acts differently from other variants that are circulating, according to the WHO. As for its spread, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explains the variant will likely spread more easily than previous strains. However, it’s still too early to know how it compares to the Delta variant in that regard. “Omicron has a bunch of mutations in an area that might make it more transmittable and it looks like it likely is more transmittable, but the exact mechanism is not clear yet,” said Dr. Lisa Barrett, an infectious disease specialist at Dalhousie University in Halifax. “It will at least get around some of the protection from infection that vaccines provide, but there’s still good protection so far from severe disease and death.” With the possibility of many Canadians getting sick this cold season, many people are wondering how symptoms of a regular cold differ from something more serious like Omicron. However, making that distinction is more difficult than it sounds. The common cold is a viral infection of your upper respiratory tract — your nose and throat — according to the Mayo Clinic. Someone with a cold may experience a runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, cough and body aches. COVID-19 is also a respiratory virus, and someone who is infected will experience similar symptoms. In some cases gastrointestinal symptoms, like diarrhea and nausea, can also overlap between the coronavirus and the cold. The one symptom you can experience with COVID-19 and not with influenza is loss of smell. However, many people with the coronavirus don’t lose their sense of smell and Barrett says it’s not a “useful tool to differentiate between the two.” With both infections giving off similar effects, self-diagnosing is not a safe option. When experiencing any of the mentioned symptoms, the only way to know for sure is to get tested. It's still too early to know for sure, but some scientists and doctors have indicated that the Omicron variant generally results in less severe symptoms than the Delta variant.  Some health experts have said that symptoms include night sweats, fatigue, mild muscles aches and a scratchy, dry throat. And while early evidence may indicate the Omicron variant results in more mild symptoms among those with two (and especially three) vaccines, the picture is starkly different for unvaccinated patients. With cases of Omicron climbing across the country and the world, experts believe the variant will become the dominant strain very soon. In newly released modelling data Ontario’s Science Advisory Table suggests the new variant will become the dominant strain in the province this week. Barrett is concerned about how rapidly Omicron is spreading, but says she isn't panicking yet. “We do have to be careful what we do in the next number of weeks and so I’m concerned it’s spreading very quickly and it has the ability at least decrease the effectiveness of two doses of vaccine. We think a third dose can help to get around that fact,” Barrett told Yahoo Canada. By now the public is well versed in ways to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and experts advise more of the same. “I think it’s ambitious and somewhat naive to think that just keeping people from travelling is going to change the amount of Omicron in this country,” Barrett said. “What we do inside our borders and in our own towns and everyday life is far more important.” The World Health Organization says it will continue to provide updates as more information becomes available on Omicron. When it comes to what you can be doing, the recommendations haven’t changed. Wearing a good mask (experts recently advised Canadians ditch their single-layer cloth masks in favour of medical masks), social distancing especially when indoors, staying home when sick and washing your hands regularly are good practices everyone should be maintaining throughout the cold season and the pandemic. And of course, get your booster. Health officials are urging Canadians that the best way to protect from the Omicron variant right now is to get your third COVID-19 vaccine shot when you are eligible.

And in 2017, the Trump White House's white branches also drew criticism on social media. Former President Donald Trump is still not over his wife Melania's Christmas decorations being panned. In a speech at the First Baptist Church in Dallas, the former president criticized the media for going after his wife's White House Christmas displays. ""I have to just start by wishing everybody a very, very merry Christmas,"" Trump said during his speech. He went on to talk about how Melania was a former first lady ""loved by everybody"" but lamented that she ""didn't get exactly a fair shake.""  The entire interior of the White House was completely gutted. ""She would make the most beautiful Christmas decorations,"" Trump said. ""And I remember she made these magnificent red trees, and the media said, 'Oh, that's terrible.' I said, 'Honey, next time, try white.' ""She made magnificent — remember, the most beautiful you've ever seen — white trees. And they said, 'Oh, that's terrible.' I said, the next time, 'Let's do it more traditional.

12/22/2021,"By Mark Trevelyan (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that Russia had no room to retreat in a standoff with the United States over Ukraine and would be forced into a tough response unless the West dropped its ""aggressive line"". Putin addressed the remarks to military officials as Russia pressed for an urgent U.S. and NATO response to proposals it made last week for a binding set of security guarantees from the West. ""What the U.S. is doing in Ukraine is at our doorstep... And they should understand that we have nowhere further to retreat to. Do they think we’ll just watch idly?"" Putin said. ""If the aggressive line of our Western colleagues continues, we will take adequate military-technical response measures and react harshly to unfriendly steps."" Putin did not spell out the nature of these measures but his phrasing mirrored that used previously by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who has warned that Russia may redeploy intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe in response to what it sees as NATO plans to do the same. Russia rejects Ukrainian and U.S. charges that it may be preparing an invasion of Ukraine as early as next month by tens of thousands of Russian troops poised within reach of the border. It says it needs pledges from the West - including a promise not to conduct NATO military activity in Eastern Europe - because its security is threatened by Ukraine's growing ties with the Western alliance and the possibility of NATO missiles being deployed against it on Ukrainian territory. Ukraine's President Volodymr Zelenskiy said on Friday that he was ready to meet Russia for ""direct talks, tête-à-tête, we don't mind in what format"". But Moscow has said repeatedly it sees no point in such a meeting without clarity on what the agenda would be. A Kremlin statement said Putin stressed in a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron that reconvening the four-power Normandy group - which brings together the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany - would require concrete steps by Kyiv to implement existing peace agreements. Ukraine says it is Russia and its proxies who are refusing to engage. With Western powers keen to show Russia they are solid in their support of Ukraine and NATO, Germany's new Chancellor Olaf Scholz also spoke by phone with Putin. U.S. SUPPLIES Karen Donfried, the U.S. State Department's top diplomat for Europe, in a briefing with reporters, said Washington was prepared to engage with Moscow via three channels - bilaterally, through the NATO-Russia Council that last met in 2019, and at the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. In the meantime, she said, the United States would continue to send military equipment and supplies to Ukraine in the weeks and months ahead - something that has antagonised Moscow. ""As President (Joe) Biden has told President Putin, should Russia further invade Ukraine, we will provide additional defensive materials to the Ukrainians above and beyond that which we are already in the process of providing,"" she said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance would seek meaningful discussions with Moscow early next year. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu alleged that more than 120 U.S. private military contractors were active in eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian troops have been fighting Russian-backed separatists since 2014, and said they were preparing a ""provocation"" involving chemical substances. He offered no evidence in support of the claim, which Pentagon spokesman John Kirby described as ""completely false"". Throughout the crisis, Russia has veered between harsh rhetoric, calls for dialogue and dire warnings, with Ryabkov repeatedly comparing the situation to the 1962 Cuban missile crisis when the world stood on the brink of nuclear war. Many of its demands, including for a block on NATO membership for Ukraine and the withdrawal of U.S. and other allied troops from Eastern Europe, are seen as non-starters by Washington and its partners. But rejecting them out of hand would risk closing off any space for dialogue and further fuelling the crisis.

12/22/2021,"An Amazon delivery driver in Las Vegas recently had to make an unscheduled stop – to save a woman and small dog being attacked by a pit bull. Lauren Ray, 19, was outside on Dec. 13 when an unleashed pit bull attacked her family's smaller dog, Max. Ray picked up Max and attempted to fend off the dog's attack, captured on video by the family's Ring doorbell camera. ""My first thought was 'Save the dog,'"" Ray told Fox 5 Las Vegas. ""I would’ve let the dog bite me for all I care. I just wanted him to be safe because he’s so small, compared to a pit bull, he didn’t stand a chance."" However, Ray was unable to fend off the pit bull which continued to circle and snap at her and Max. Her scream for help was soon answered by Amazon delivery driver Stephanie Lontz who put herself between the dog and Ray and told her to get in the house. Drive-thru delivers: McDonald's employee leaps out of drive-up window to save woman choking on a chicken nugg The shortest day of the year is Tuesday: Here's what to know about the winter solstice. Lauren's father, Michael Ray, a real estate agent, was about to show a home when he got a notification from his Ring cam and saw the incident unfold. He was in ""panic mode,"" he told Fox 5. ""I’m a half-hour away from the house. It’s literally like I’m watching a football game and screaming at it, ‘Get in the house. Get in the house.'"" Then, he saw the Amazon driver swoop ""in like Wonder Woman"" and give Lauren Ray time to get herself and Max inside. Before departing, the driver hollered at the pit bull, ""You're a bad dog!"" The Rays posted video of the incident in hopes of finding the driver who intervened, according to Fox 5 Las Vegas. And this past weekend, they were able to meet Lontz and thank her in person. ""I would have been lost without any help,"" Lauren Ray said. ""I had no clue what I was going to do. I didn’t know if I was going to get hurt. And someone risking their life like that is a really big thing and means a lot to me."" Lontz said hearing Ray's screams ""made me think of my own child. I would only hope that somebody would jump in and help her if she was in a similar situation. It's the human thing to do."" It's not unusual for Amazon delivery drivers to come across similar incidents, Lontz said. ""Two days prior I had been bit by a dog. Two days before that, I saved a baby who wasn’t even two 2-years-old yet locked in a house,"" she said. ""We really do go through a lot and we’re there when other people aren’t. Sometimes it’s not even recognized. I have a coworker who put out a fire in a backyard the other day."" In addition to a thank you from the Rays, Lontz was also met with gifts and balloons from co-workers and members of Local 702 Logistics, the local courier company contracted by Amazon.

12/22/2021,"On the 10th anniversary of former supreme leader of North Korea Kim Jong-il's death last week and the beginning of the country's 11-day bereavement mandate, a noticeably slimmer Kim Jong-un made an appearance to commemorate his father's death.

Death anniversary: Donning his trademark black leather coat, North Korean's supreme leader Kim Jong-un, 37, stood in front of thousands of North Koreans who attended the memorial service at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, the mausoleum of the late leader, on Friday, according to Reuters. North Korea's flag was also flown at half-mast as part of the commemoration.
 

 State television footage of the memorial showed Kim looking slimmer than he has in recent years. International media first noticed the change in his physical appearance after he celebrated the 73rd anniversary of North Korea in September, Sky News reported. Rumors and speculation involving his health began circulating after his images were posted online. In late October, South Korea's ​​National Intelligence Service confirmed that Kim lost 44 pounds and that the North Korean government has not been using a body double, ABC News reported. For the 10th anniversary of Kim Jong Il’s death, North Koreans were required to enter an 11-day mourning period and adhere to several bans the government imposed, such as laughing, drinking alcohol and participating in leisure activities, a resident of Sinuiju told Radio Free Asia (RFA). “In the past many people who were caught drinking or being intoxicated during the mourning period were arrested and treated as ideological criminals. They were taken away and never seen again,” the source said, adding that celebrating birthdays and mourning lost loved ones are also not allowed during this period. Local police were also informed to stay vigilant for anyone “who fail[s] to appear appropriately bereaved,” another source said. In addition to the mourning period, elderly military veterans will hold events to raise awareness about Kim Jong-il’s accomplishments. Some of the events include a photography and art exhibition in South Hamgyong and a remembrance concert. 
  Other details: Kim Jong-il succeeded his father, Kim Il-sung, after his death on July 8, 1994. He ruled North Korea until his death on Dec. 17, 2011. The country experienced several challenges under his leadership, including several food shortages, which led to the ""arduous march"" (also known as the “meal-skipping campaign”). On the day of Kim Jong-il’s death, Kim Jong-un, the late ruler’s son who had remained unheard of before the transfer of power, took over the supreme leader position at the age of 27. During his first year in office, Kim Jong-un reportedly purged high-ranking officials from the government who could challenge his authority. North Korea has allegedly carried out 27 death sentences ever since Kim Jong-un became leader in 2011, human rights group Transitional Justice Working Group claimed, Daily Star reported. ""In 2012 or 2013 in Pyongyang an executed body was burned with a flame-thrower in front of a crowd following execution. The family of the accused was forced to attend the execution and sit in the front row to observe. The father fainted after watching his son burn in front of his eyes,"" a defector told the human rights group. Last month, a man was reportedly executed via a firing squad for allegedly smuggling copies of Netflix’s hit South Korean series “Squid Game” into North Korea through USBs.

12/22/2021,"By Mark Trevelyan (Reuters) - Ukraine's armed forces are heavily outnumbered and outgunned by Russia's but could put up a level of resistance that would force Russian President Vladimir Putin to pay a price of many thousands of Russian lives for any new invasion. Western military analysts say Ukraine's army is better trained and equipped than in 2014, when Russia captured the Crimean peninsula without a fight, and highly motivated to defend the country's heartland. For those reasons, they see it as highly unlikely that Putin would contemplate an outright conquest of Ukraine. ""We won't see a big giant red arrow going across Ukraine. I don't believe the Russians have the capability to just completely overrun Ukraine and take over the whole country, nor do I think they want to,"" said Ben Hodges, a retired U.S. lieutenant general now with the Center for European Policy Analysis. A plausible alternative, he and others said, was that Russia might push south and west from Ukraine's Donbass region - already controlled by pro-Russian forces - to link up with annexed Crimea and the Black Sea. But even that more limited objective would entail high Russian casualties. Siemon Wezeman, an arms specialist at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, said the scale of resistance to any invasion would dwarf anything Russia had faced in previous military operations in Chechnya in the 1990s or in its short war with Georgia in 2008. ""Yes it can defeat, say, the high level of Ukrainian forces, but try to invade a country like Ukraine with a population that is clearly against you, which is armed to the teeth, where most males have at least rudimentary military training that they can still remember. You're going into an area which is Chechnya multiplied by 10, or Georgia multiplied by 30,"" he said. ""It's not going to be a walkover. And then you have to defend to your own population as Russian president that you just suffered 10,000 losses in the first few days because you were stupid enough to support the Donbass rebels. I don't think that's going to resonate very well in Russia."" Ukraine says 92,000 Russian troops have gathered near its borders, and the United States has said a Russian invasion by a force as large as 175,000 could come as early as January. Moscow denies menacing its neighbour and say it can move its troops around as it sees fit on its own territory. It says it perceives a threat from Ukraine's growing ties with NATO - which Kyiv seeks one day to join - and is demanding security guarantees from the West to defuse the crisis. DAUNTING NUMBERS In terms of manpower and weapons, the arithmetic looks grim for Ukraine. Russia's army of 280,000 is about twice the size of Ukraine's and its total armed forces of 900,000 are more than four times greater. Its 2,840 battle tanks outnumber Ukraine's by more than three to one, according to the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). While Ukraine trebled its defence budget in real terms from 2010 to 2020, its total defence expenditure last year amounted to only $4.3 billion, or one-tenth of Russia's. ""In terms of air defence and electronic warfare, there is a huge gap between these two forces. It's difficult to see how Ukraine could not be completely overwhelmed from the air,"" said IISS research analyst Yohann Michel. Russia would seek to use its superiority in electronic warfare to paralyse its adversary's command and control and cut off communications with units in the field, he said. But Ukraine's combat experience in Donbass and its short-range air defences and anti-tank weaponry - which includes U.S.-supplied Javelin missiles - would help to slow any Russian advance. ""It will not be a piece of cake because there is still a large number of (Ukrainian) troops. The majority of them are well motivated, so they will probably fight until the last moment,"" Michel said. Even a defeated Ukraine could ""open their arms depot"", distribute weapons to the population and leave the Russians facing a kind of guerrilla warfare that would make it painful to hold onto any captured territory. ""I would not want to be in six months in any area the Russians would have seized,"" he said. Putin would likely face qualms from his own public about waging war on a fellow Slav nation, as well as intense anti-Russian sentiment within Ukraine. Former U.S. lieutenant general Hodges said that while the numbers were stacked against Ukraine, ""as you know from history, warfare is never just about math"". ""The Ukrainian population will be very hostile, the further west that Russian forces might go. This will be very, very costly for Russian forces,"" he said. ""The reward, the payoff, would have to be really worthwhile to keep (Putin's) own domestic population in support.""

12/22/2021,"“Look out for the trigger words,” the woman says. She’s perched on a chair in front of the room. She’s well-dressed yet funky with elegant boots, a demure sweater and some colorful jewelry. “‘Equality,’ ‘diversity,’ ‘inclusion,’ ‘marginalization,’... These words are CRT. If you see these words in your kids’ homework, you need to speak out.” I am in a meeting held by a local right-wing mom’s group. It’s an organization catering to mothers who are bent on protesting at school board meetings to stop the supposedly evil critical race theory agenda from being taught in public schools and address other typically conservative concerns. Critical race theory is not currently being taught in public schools. There are about 20 of us. We are all maskless, all (apparently) white, mostly women and all on the younger side. I’m in my early 40s and I seem to be the oldest person in the room. A group of children, including my son, the only one in a mask, are scampering merrily in a play area down the hall while a young woman with a baby in her front carrier keeps an eye on them. On the wall by the door of our seminar room is a sign. It says: “Children should be: Heard. Respected. Encouraged. Loved. Appreciated. Guided with Compassion. Given Freedom to Learn Without Coercion.” What exactly that last phrase means is ominously vague. For several years now I have been worried about the increasing right-wing views that I have noticed in my demographic (white suburban women). Before 2016, I always thought of Nazis as mainly historical villains that belonged in Indiana Jones movies or old news reels or the sad stories my grandfather told me. Now, however, as the last Holocaust survivors are dying, I am aware that fascism is creeping back into the world at large in terrifying ways. I wanted to know how I could fight against the appallingly stupid yet dangerously widespread disinformation that is entrancing many of my friends and neighbors. Basic facts about COVID-19 are being dismissed by whole states as part of the “liberal mainstream corporate media.” Bodies from COVID victims were stacking up in ICUs and filling the morgues back in 2020, yet I was still called a “child abuser” by people on the street because I made my son wear a mask. Why are people going nuts? Why are people dismissing science and history in favor of conspiracy theories? And, most importantly, how could we nudge the nation in a saner direction? I was especially curious about activist groups that specifically target suburban women. These groups seemed intent on making life more dangerous for my child. According to my local right-wing women’s group, masks should not be allowed in school. They told us to stop worrying about kids dying of COVID. They were also vocal about not wanting racism and its deep, formative history in the United States to be taught. Some of these people literally do not believe white privilege exists because, according to them, the Union soldiers who fought in the Civil War were overwhelmingly white. (No, I don’t understand that argument either.) Others feel parts of our country’s history shouldn’t be included in curriculums if it makes people ― namely white people ― uncomfortable. Every teacher I knew was struggling with COVID restrictions and dealing with students venting their post-pandemic trauma through increasingly disruptive behavior. School districts across the country were dealing with staffing shortages due to teachers burning out from stress. Why add to teachers’ difficulties by threatening school instructors who dared to teach topics like Jim Crow laws, the civil rights movement and the repercussions of slavery in America? Some of these people literally do not believe white privilege exists because, according to them, the Union soldiers who fought in the Civil War were overwhelmingly white. (No, I don’t understand that argument either.) To learn more, I joined a local right-wing Facebook group for moms. It’s a private group that requires aspiring members to answer some questions before they’re granted entry. One question was “Why do you want to join?” I replied, “I want to be more involved with my kids’ school.” A week passed and then a moderator for the group contacted me privately. “Can you be more specific about what issue most concerns you?” Yikes. Security was apparently very tight with this group. They weren’t going to let just any mom glide in using a few generic answers. “I’m mostly interested in issues that involve keeping kids physically in school,” I messaged back. “Zoom school was devastating for my kid and I don’t want that to happen again.” I wasn’t lying about any of that. It’s one of the few opinions I share with many conservative parents. The moderator sent me a thumbs-up emoji and let me into the group. Once inside, I found the members were all stripes of Republican and I was pleasantly surprised to see opinion was not monolithic in the group. Several moms argued against the more far-right posters. One woman posted an objection to children reading “To Kill a Mockingbird” in class. “Divisive Concepts,” she wrote with a broken heart emoji. Underneath was a screenshot of a direct message from someone who appeared to be a student that read, “I’m in English right now. We’re currently reading ‘To Kill a Mockingbird.’ There’s a part where Calpurnia brings the kids to church with her and another black woman is being extremely racist towards Scout and Jem. My teacher was saying it was not racism because white people have a higher power over black people in society and that black people can’t be racist.” There were several indignant emoji reactions in response to this post. One mom, however, pushed back. “Well,” she commented, “the woman at the church complained that Calpurnia had brought white children to the Black church, possibly one of the few places Black people felt any sense of freedom and safety. It’s a little absurd to call the woman racist, given the context.” This comment got a couple “likes” and no pushback. Another surprise I found in the Facebook group was that some huge media outlets were giving them a platform. One of the founders of the group posted that she had done an interview with The New York Times as part of a story on parental rights. The New York Times! I was dumbfounded. None of the women who ran the pro-Democrat “Indivisible” groups in my town had even managed to get an interview with the local paper! I scanned the comments and my eyes nearly popped out of my head. “It’ll be fine,” another mom wrote after the initial poster expressed concern about The New York Times possibly misquoting her. “It’s a lesson I learned the hard way after the BBC screwed me.” The BBC! The BBC was talking to these women? I had to know more. Unfortunately a few of the moms may have become suspicious of me. Perhaps I had “liked” too many comments by moms pushing back against the anti-CRT posts. Perhaps some moderators had found the very liberal comments that I had posted on other public news articles. In any case, when I expressed interest in joining an in-person roundtable discussion event, I saw that the location of the event suddenly disappeared. I messaged the group moderator about the event location. “Just a heads up,” she messaged back, “I think most people will not be masking. Is that something you’ll be comfortable with?” I wondered if she was trying to frighten me off. “Yes, that’s fine,” I replied. I never received the location, but luckily I had written it down before it disappeared from the event post. I drove to the meeting with my son. The group moderator had been right. When I joined the meeting, I saw that nobody in the packed room was masked. I gritted my teeth and sat down anyway. I was fully vaccinated and my son wore a mask. He was the only one. I listened to the speakers at the meeting while they discussed how to run for, campaign and pressure school boards. Many parents bemoaned how they had to pull their kids from public schools over mask mandates and instead enroll them in private schools. It was a common story. I got the impression that most of these families had income levels that allowed them to pay thousands in private school fees because they wanted to take a stand on masks. I was probably the poorest person there. There was a lot of anger directed at teachers. “Rat out these teachers,” one mother instructed. “Find a lawyer who can challenge these teachers.” Another woman disdainfully noted that teachers “don’t even know what they’re doing half the time. They just pull it off the internet.” A third woman said, “There is no discipline for teachers outside of taking away their credentials.” The battle lines were clearly drawn. I raised my hand. “What do you say to people who are like, ‘Oh, you’re gonna put bounties on teachers’ heads. You’re marching outside of school board members’ homes with guns. School board members are getting death threats and feeling terrorized’?” I could see several women visibly flinch at the word “bounty.” One woman said she disliked the term “bounty” but she could see the need for “monetary compensation” for those who turn in teachers that were doing things parents found unacceptable. “There are no repercussions for teachers who break the law,” she said. “If we have to offer monetary compensation for people to report teachers, I see no problem with that. It’s an incentive for people to wake up.” It wasn’t clear what laws these teachers were supposedly breaking. As far as I could tell, teachers ― like everyone else ― got punished if they broke laws. Another woman raised her hand. “Look, I know we want to change school boards,” she said, “but elections aren’t until 2023. What do we do until then? We just can’t sit around and let them attack our kids. We have to do SOMETHING.” I caught a gleam in the woman’s eye I didn’t like. Was there some flirtation with insurrection being suggested here? What, exactly, was she saying? Another woman nodded. “Listen, we’ve tried playing nice. But they just dig in their heels and dig in their heels. We have to start being not so nice.” One woman said she disliked the term 'bounty' but she could see the need for 'monetary compensation' for those who turn in teachers that were doing things parents found unacceptable. ... 'If we have to offer monetary compensation for people to report teachers, I see no problem with that. It’s an incentive for people to wake up.' I didn’t like where the discussion was going. The moderator guided the topic back to safer ground. “Be pleasantly persistent,” she smiled. “Be annoying. Be the woman at the school board meetings who always shows up. Be the person who, when the meeting organizers see you, say, ‘Oh, God, her again.’ Be that person. And please try to get people to vote in municipal elections.”  Fair enough. A lot of the roundtable debate felt like a Republican version of a Run for Something meeting. Run for Something was a movement started after Donald Trump won the presidency that was meant to encourage young progressives to start their own campaigns for local political office. This right-wing women’s group seemed to be following the same model, but there was an undercurrent of rage among the group members that I had never seen in a Run for Something meeting.  Despite my uneasiness, I couldn’t help but find myself liking the women in the room. They were charismatic. They were energetic. They had no problem letting my low-functioning autistic son play with their children, which is unfortunately rare among a lot of the other mothers I’ve encountered. But this made me even more uneasy. I realized these women were dangerous precisely because they were so friendly. Their condemnation of history lessons about Ruby Bridges and Jim Crow laws and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was repulsive. They were trying to suppress the truth by labeling the unassailable facts of racism in the U.S. as “divisive.” “Equality,” “diversity” and “inclusion” were not virtues to be celebrated but “trigger words” with a poisonous intent. This nefariously clever bit of relabeling disgusted me. There was a very clear far-right agenda at work here. Groups like the one I joined often appeal to mothers. The pandemic has hit moms especially hard. Lack of child care has resulted in a “she-cession” with thousands of women leaving the workforce to take care of their children. Lonely, frustrated, financially stressed people tend to be prime targets for radical groups. These right-wing women’s groups offer a sense of community and friendship to women who are isolated at home with their kids. It can be frighteningly easy for some people to start nodding along with all the rhetoric about the evils of critical race theory and COVID conspiracy theories if the women espousing them are also offering you coffee and friendship and child care ― and making you feel seen and heard. I am currently still a member of this local right-wing women’s Facebook group. It has helped me to understand where these people are coming from ― and just how motivated they are. My membership could end up being rescinded, however, as I plan to attend a few upcoming school board meetings to defend the accurate and honest teaching of all parts of American history, especially in regard to racism and what it has meant and means to be Black in this country. I can’t stop thinking about the gleam in that woman’s eye as she said, “We just can’t sit around and let them attack our kids. We have to do something.” Though some people think merely tweeting our outrage or frustration is productive (it’s not), those of us fighting against the far right need to be more aware of how energetic and organized they’re becoming and the lengths they’re willing to go to in order to get their way. Right-wing activists are attending school board meetings in hopes of transforming our children’s education, and, ultimately, their lives and the future of the United States. It’s time for us to be just as active to ensure this doesn’t happen. We must fight for our children’s safety and their right to learn our nation’s history ― even the ugly parts. Especially the ugly parts.  After all, when ugly history gets ignored, it tends to get repeated.

12/22/2021,"The first American believed to have died of Omicron was an unvaccinated Texan in his 50s. The man, who died on Monday, had underlying conditions and had contracted COVID-19 once before. The Omicron variant now accounts for 73% of sequenced cases in the United States, the CDC reported. The first American believed to have died of the Omicron variant was an unvaccinated man from Texas who had already had the coronavirus once before, county officials said. The man, a Harris County, Texas, resident between 50 and 60 years old, was a high-risk patient due to underlying conditions and his unvaccinated status, a press release from the county said. He died on Monday. ""This is a reminder of the severity of COVID-19 and its variants,"" Harris County Public Health Executive Director Barbie Robinson said in a statement. ""We urge all residents who qualify to get vaccinated and get their booster shot if they have not already."" ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the patient's family, and we extend our deepest sympathies,"" she added. The man is the first recorded death attributed to the Omicron coronavirus variant in the US. Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo also urged people in the county to get vaccinated and boosted in a tweet posted Monday. The Omicron variant now accounts for 73% of all sequenced COVID-19 cases in the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Monday. Previously, the Delta variant was dominant nationwide. That changed last week — just 26% of sequenced cases were Delta for the week ending December 18, according to CDC data. As the Omicron variant sweeps the nation, cases are up. In the US, the seven-day rolling average for new COVID-19 infections was 132,659 on Sunday, according to data from the CDC. The nation's seven-day average test positivity rate currently stands at 7.2%, higher than the 5% threshold the WHO recommends staying below. The Harris County man who died Monday is one of at least 808,000 Americans who have been killed by the virus since the pandemic began, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Some parts of the country are experiencing even more pronounced Omicron surges. The CDC estimates that in parts of the Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, and Southwest, Omicron now makes up more than 90% of sequenced cases. In response to the growing crisis, President Joe Biden is announcing new measures on Tuesday to combat Omicron, including delivering 500,000 free at-home coronavirus testing kits to Americans next month. People who need tests will be able to access them using a website set up by health officials. The administration will also deploy military health workers to strained hospitals in January and February, according to the White House. It's clear that the whiplash arrival of Omicron has changed the game, experts say. ""We have to acknowledge the reality that unfortunately, with a heavy heart, the virus is in charge,"" Mara Aspinall, an expert in medical diagnostics at Arizona State University, told the New York Times, adding, ""We need to take back control, and the only way to do that as a society is to test and isolate, test and isolate, repeat, repeat, repeat.""

12/22/2021,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Doling out pardons is a holiday tradition for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who around every Christmas grants them to a handful of ordinary citizens, typically for minor offenses committed years or decades ago.  But one name stands out on his desk: George Floyd. Abbott has not said whether he will posthumously pardon Floyd this year for a 2004 drug arrest in Houston by a former officer whose police work is no longer trusted by prosecutors. Texas' parole board — stacked with Abbott appointees — unanimously recommended a pardon for Floyd in October.  Since then, the two-term Republican governor, who is up for reelection in 2022, has given no indication of whether he will grant what would be only the second posthumous pardon in Texas history. Floyd, who was Black, spent much of his life in Houston before moving to Minnesota, where his death under the knee of a white police officer last year led to a U.S. reckoning on race and policing. “It doesn’t matter who you think George Floyd was, or what you think he stood for or didn’t stand for,” said Allison Mathis, a public defender in Houston who submitted Floyd's pardon application. “What matters is he didn’t do this. It’s important for the governor to correct the record to show he didn’t do this.” A spokeswoman for Abbott did not respond to requests for comment.  Pardons restore the rights of the convicted and forgive them in the eyes of the law. Floyd’s family and supporters said a posthumous pardon for him in Texas would show a commitment to accountability.  In February 2004, Floyd was arrested in Houston for selling $10 worth of crack in a police sting. He pleaded guilty to a drug charge and served 10 months in prison.  His case happened to be among dozens that prosecutors revisited in the fallout over a deadly drug raid in 2019 that resulted in murder charges against an officer, Gerald Goines, who is no longer with the Houston force. Prosecutors say Goines lied to obtain a search warrant in the 2019 raid that left a husband and wife dead, and the office of Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg has since dismissed more than 160 drug convictions tied to Goines.  Goines has pleaded not guilty and his attorneys accuse Ogg of launching the review for political gain. Abbott has several primary challengers from the far right, and his ongoing silence about a potential pardon for Floyd has raised questions by Mathis and others over whether political calculations are at play. His office has not responded to those charges.  Abbott attended Floyd’s memorial service last year in Houston, where he met with the family and floated the idea of a “George Floyd Act” that would take aim at police brutality. But Abbott never publicly supported such a measure months later when lawmakers returned to the Capitol, where Republicans instead made police funding a priority. State Sen. Royce West, a Democrat who carried the “George Floyd Act” in the Senate, said he understands the politics if Abbott was waiting until after the GOP primary elections in March. But he said the governor should act on the recommendation.  “As he’s always said, he is a law and order governor,"" West said. “And this would be following the law."" ___ Find AP’s full coverage of the death of George Floyd at: https://apnews.com/hub/death-of-george-floyd",U.S./Associated Press,Texas governor's decision: Whether to pardon George Floyd,https://news.yahoo.com/texas-governors-decision-whether-pardon-044748950.html
12/22/2021,"WORCESTER — The parents of a Worcester-raised actor were found dead inside their Tatnuck home Monday night after she called a relative to check on them. Alicia Witt, a singer/songwriter, actress and author, said in a written statement that she had not heard back from her parents, Robert and Diane Witt, for several days. ""I reached out to a cousin who lives close to my parents to check on them. Sadly, the outcome was unimaginable,"" she wrote. ""I ask for some privacy at this time to grieve and to wrap my head around this turn of events, and this surreal loss."" The deaths of the couple, found inside their Sussex Lane home Monday night are not suspicious, but, police said, the cause of their demise is a mystery. Police were called to the home shortly after 9 p.m. by a family member who requested assistance in checking on the couple, Worcester police said. Once inside the home, the officers found the couple deceased. There there were no obvious signs of a cause of death, police said. ""There was no trauma,"" Lt. Sean Murtha said. Police listed Diane Witt as being 75 and Robert Witt as 87. There were reports that the couple had been experiencing furnace problems and were using a space heater, police said. Firefighters were summoned and checked the air quality inside the home but found that no noxious gases were present, Worcester Fire Deputy Chief Adam Roche said. ""There were no signs of carbon monoxide,"" Roche said. A neighbor said the couple were rarely seen outside the home and that she believed they had been ill for sometime. She said many neighbors had offered them help as their home fell into disrepair, but they politely refused. One neighbor had been mowing the lawn and clearing snow from the property for a few years, she said. Police said the state medical examiner will perform autopsies to determine a cause of death. The couple have two children, Ian Witt and Alicia Witt. She recently released a new album and published a book. Her career has included recent roles in “Orange Is the New Black,” “Nashville,” “Twin Peaks” and “Twin Peaks: The Return,” “The Walking Dead,” ""Two Weeks Notice,"" ""88 Minutes"" and “Mr. Holland’s Opus”. Diane Witt was a celebrity in her own right in the1980s when her hair, which was more than 10-feet long, earned her a spot in the Guiness Book of World Records. Reports from that time indicate that her husband and children helped her maintain her tresses which she wore braided and piled atop her head. Diane Witt home-schooled the couple's children and Robert was a science teacher at Burncoat Middle School. Craig S. Semon of the Telegram & Gazette staff contributed to this report.

12/22/2021,"Madelyn Allen went missing on December 13 after traveling to see a man she met online, police said. The police found her five days later covered in coal in a basement in Utah, court documents said. Brent Brown, 39, was arrested on charges of kidnapping and rape, a local report said. A missing Utah college student was found in the basement of a man now suspected of kidnapping and raping her, the police said, according to local reports. The reports described court documents as saying that when the police found Madelyn Allen, a 19-year-old student at Snow College in Ephraim, she had no clothes and was covered in coal dust. Allen was reported missing earlier this month after she didn't return from a date with a man she met online, The Salt Lake Tribune reported on Sunday. In a press conference on Sunday, Snow College Police Chief Derek Walk identified the man as Brent Brown, 39. Brown has since been arrested on charges including kidnapping, rape, object rape, and obstruction of justice, the local news station KSL reported, citing a police affidavit. The affidavit said that in interviews with the police, Brown said he met Allen in a bondage chat group, KSL reported. The Tribune reported that the affidavit said that after Brown picked up Allen on December 13, he took her wallet, made her get naked, and tied her up while he went to work. When Brown discovered that the police were looking for Allen, he threw her phone away, the affidavit said, according to The Tribune. The police said they managed to track Allen to a house in Loa on Saturday by using cell-tower data. The affidavit said that officers searching near the house spotted someone who looked like Allen in the basement from outside, KSL reported. The affidavit reportedly said that the man who answered the door claimed to be alone but that the officers found Allen naked in the basement covered in coal dust. It said Allen told the police that Brown had raped her several times, KSL reported. ""We don't have a lot of information about him,"" Walk said of Brown on Sunday. ""We met him for the first time last night, and we don't know how extensive his relationship or her knowledge of him is, thus far.""

12/22/2021,"By Nancy Lapid    (Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.    Omicron infections no less severe based on early UK data    Infections caused by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus do not appear to be less severe than infections from Delta, according to early data from the UK.    Researchers at Imperial College London compared 11,329 people with confirmed or likely Omicron infections with nearly 200,000 people infected with other variants. So far, according to a report issued ahead of peer review and updated on Monday, they see ""no evidence of Omicron having lower severity than Delta, judged by either the proportion of people testing positive who report symptoms, or by the proportion of cases seeking hospital care after infection.""    For vaccines available in the UK, effectiveness against symptomatic Omicron infection ranged from 0% to 20% after two doses, and from 55% to 80% following a booster dose. The report also estimated that after taking individual risk factors into account, the odds of reinfection with Omicron are 5.4 times greater than for reinfection with Delta. A study of healthcare workers in the pre-Omicron era estimated that a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection afforded 85% protection against a second infection over 6 months, the researchers said, while ""the protection against reinfection by Omicron afforded by past infection may be as low as 19%.""    Sperm count, motility may be low for months after COVID-19    Sperm quality is impaired for months for some people after recovery from COVID-19, researchers have found.    The semen itself was not infectious, the researchers found. But among 35 men who provided samples within a month after recovery from symptomatic infection, reductions in sperm motility were evident in 60% and sperm counts were reduced in 37%. As reported on Monday in Fertility and Sterility, semen samples were obtained from 120 Belgian men with an average age of 35 years, at an average of 52 days after their COVID-19 symptoms had resolved. Among 51 men tested between one and two months after recovery, 37% had reduced sperm motility and 29% had low sperm counts. Among 34 men who provided semen samples at least two months after recovery, sperm motility was impaired in 28% and sperm counts were low in 6%. The severity of COVID-19 infection was not correlated with sperm characteristics.    ""Couples with a desire for pregnancy should be warned that sperm quality after COVID-19 infection can be suboptimal,"" the researchers concluded. ""The estimated recovery time is 3 months, but further follow-up studies are under way to confirm this and to determine if permanent damage occurred in a minority of men.""    Neutralizing molecule could be cheaper than antibodies    An experimental molecule that neutralizes the coronavirus in the same way antibodies do would be cheaper and easier to manufacture, researchers said.    The molecule belongs to a class of compounds known as aptamers. Because they are made from RNA or DNA, aptamers are easier to synthesize than protein-based antibodies that can only be produced in living cells, said Julian Valero of Aarhus University in Denmark. Like antibodies, the aptamers attach themselves to protein targets - in this case, the spike protein on the virus surface - by folding into a three-dimensional conformation. A study published in PNAS shows that in test tube experiments, the aptamer binds tightly to the coronavirus spike, preventing it from breaking into human cells. It inhibits earlier variants of the virus, including Delta, the researchers said. They are planning tests to see whether it also recognizes and binds to Omicron.    Use of the aptamer in patients is still far off, with tests in mice only recently begun. In terms of use in humans, ""we're much closer"" to being able to use the aptamer to help diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections, said Jorgen Kjemsa, also of Aarhus University. Experiments comparing the use of the aptamer to antibodies in widely used rapid COVID-19 tests for infection are underway, he said.    Click for a Reuters graphic https://tmsnrt.rs/3c7R3Bl on vaccines in development.    (Reporting by Nancy Lapid; Editing by Bill Berkrot) ",Health/Reuters,"Omicron infections appear no less severe than Delta; COVID-19 lowers sperm count, motility",https://news.yahoo.com/omicron-infections-appear-no-less-195632713.html
12/22/2021,"With the metaverse beginning to look less like science fiction and more like (virtual) reality, big businesses are refusing to be left behind. “Going forward, there will be many companies who try to claim they got a piece of the metaverse,” Jim Cramer said on his show last month. Think of the metaverse as a massive, persistent online world where people can interact, often through virtual or augmented reality headsets. Numerous companies are exploring the idea, but Cramer points to four that “are currently doing the best work.” Here’s a look at the Mad Money host’s picks — plus one more outside-the-box idea for investors. This one shouldn’t come as a surprise. The company formerly known as Facebook is one of the main reasons why everyone is talking about metaverse today. As it stands, Meta largely remains a social-media company. Facebook’s monthly active users grew 6% year-over-year to 2.91 billion in Q3. Factoring in Meta’s other platforms — namely Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp — the number of active users on at least one product totaled 3.58 billion. That said, the company has many endeavors beyond social media, including virtual and augmented reality headsets and smart glasses. It sees the metaverse as “a hybrid of today’s online social experiences, sometimes expanded into three dimensions or projected into the physical world.” Shares have climbed 24% this year to $326 apiece. If that’s too steep, you can use a popular investing app to buy fractions of shares with as much money as you are willing to spend. With the chip shortage expected to last well into next year — pinching the supply of new cars and other devices — chipmakers continue to fire on all cylinders. Nvidia shares have more than doubled year-to-date. And since the company is famous for its powerful graphics chips, Cramer sees Nvidia as a key metaverse play. In the three months ended Oct. 31, Nvidia’s revenue soared 50% year-over-year to a record $7.1 billion. Adjusted earnings came in at $1.17 per share, up 60% from a year ago. Growth is expected to continue. For the current fiscal quarter, management is projecting $7.4 billion in revenue. This game developer enables users to make block-based worlds and games without needing to know how to code. It also allows creators to get paid through an in-game currency called Robux. In Q3, the platform had 47.3 million average daily active users, up 31% year-over-year. Revenue rose 102% year-over-year to $509.3 million. Cramer likes Roblox because it is “a lot of fun” and has its “own internal metaverse already.” Roblox went public in March through a direct listing and closed at $69.50 on its first day of trading. Shares surged to over $140 apiece in November but have since come back down to around $100. If you don’t like that kind of roller coaster ride, remember you can always build a diversified portfolio of blue-chip stocks just by using your “spare change.” This video game software developer recently acquired the visual effects studio behind the Avatar and Lord of the Rings movies — and Cramer is keen. “Imagine being able to be an avatar of the person who made up the Avatar,” he said on his show. Unity shares had a solid run from May to November but have pared some of the gains in recent weeks. Trading at $136 per share, the stock is actually down 5.5% year to date. That could give contrarian investors something to think about, especially considering how fast the business is growing. In Q3, Unity earned $286.3 million of revenue, representing a 43% increase year-over-year. The company also generated $34.2 million of free cash flow, which more than tripled the $10.9 million it generated in the year-ago period. While they’re certainly exciting, metaverse plays remain highly speculative. Even Wall Street experts aren’t right 100% of the time. Don’t forget that diversification is key — and you don’t have to stay in the stock market to get it. If you want to invest in something with high return potential that’s insulated from the violent swings of the stock market, consider this overlooked asset: fine art. Contemporary artwork has outperformed the S&P 500 by a commanding 174% over the past 25 years, according to the Citi Global Art Market chart. And on a scale of -1 to +1 (with 0 representing no link at all), their correlation was just 0.12 over the past 25 years. Investing in art by the likes of Banksy and Andy Warhol used to be an option only for the ultra rich, like Cramer. But with a new investing platform, you can invest in iconic artworks, too, just like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates do. This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

12/22/2021,"An Indiana mom has says she has pulled her Black daughter out of a private school in Indianapolis after she alleged that students are bullying the teenager because of her race. They claim one of the acts of bigotry was daughter being sent a meme of a hand holding a stem of cotton bolls with a caption that read “when you ask a black girl to prom.” Local station WISH TV interviewed the pair about their harassment claims and their decision to transfer Gabby Portis, a 15-year-old, from the International School of Indiana, a $22K-per-year language school. Portis told the station that she’s heard the N-word used at the school and the racism she was experiencing made her look at herself, saying, “I just look in the mirror and be like, ‘I don’t see anything wrong with me.’” Her mother, Brittany Graves, said that as soon as she was made aware of the incidents, she immediately went to the school’s administration. She says that the school offered her daughter counseling and she declined, saying, “My daughter doesn’t need counseling.” She also claims the school suspended the offending students but when the suspensions ended the bullying intensified. Gabby claimed she started to receive text messages that made her concerned for her life. When asked if she thinks that her peers would consider themselves racist, Portis said that they would. “They just walk around saying it proudly,” she affirmed. She claimed an example of how casual the racism was between students emerged after one student asked Portis for money. A different student replied, “Why would you ask her for some money? She’s Black. Black people don’t have any money.’” Now, mom has pulled Portis out of school for good, stating that she doesn’t want her child to break down mentally or hurt herself after the racialized bullying. Until the transfer is official, Graves asked the school to allow Gabby to finish out the year through its virtual learning model set up during the coronavirus pandemic. The administration refused saying that the model is only used for students that stay at home for COVID-related reasons. The head of the school Elizabeth Head released this statement to the outlet: “The International School of Indiana (ISI) is an inclusive, diverse, and respectful community. ISI does not tolerate racial intolerance or other discriminatory conduct and takes reports of such alleged misconduct very seriously. Such reports are investigated promptly and thoroughly in order to gain a complete understanding of what allegedly happened. After investigating, ISI takes firm and appropriate steps to remedy and address any misbehavior. The nature of those steps depends upon the severity of what occurred.” “As ISI’s policy is that matters concerning students are confidential, the School is unable to provide details of specific situations.” But the private K-12 school has a student population of approximately 556 students, according to USA School Info. The site also reports that individuals who identify as white make up 70 percent of the student body. Blacks make up a little over 4 percent. Students who identify as mixed-race or who have multiple ethnicities total 12.8 percent of the population. Asians comprise 10 percent of the student body. Portis’ story mirrors those of other students who have left schools because of racism. Recently, Atlanta Black Star reported on a Rochester mom that pulled her sixth grader and eleventh grader out of the Pittsford school district in upstate New York. Victoria Love said in an interview that she and her spouse were tired of their children experiencing racial slurs at a place where they were supposed to be learning. “My husband and I made the tough decision to remove our students because we felt like five years was long enough,” she said last month. “A lot of the racist incidents do involve Black students, but it’s not only Black students.” One of the incidents that was filmed and placed on social media was of a white student with a toy gun who claimed that he wanted to kill Black people. Love says that the video frightened people, “The students at that particular high school were scared, and the point of someone making a video like that is to frighten and harm other people.” Five hours south in New Rochelle, New York, a teen baseball star named Tony Humphrey is leaving his school after he contends that a school staff exhibited racial bigotry toward him by stereotyping him as a thug. The assistant athletics director Bernard Mahoney asked the student why he was doing track, a sport he signed up for after his baseball season. When the young man said that he wanted to improve his speed, Mahoney stated that Blacks “gained that speed by running from the police.” Humphrey, who had already accepted an offer to go to Boston College after he graduates, shared that after that incident, he decided to transfer schools. “I decided to leave, because of my current situation, as I’m already committed. I’m already going to [college],” he shared. “I don’t feel like I have to stay at a program where they’re going to look at me different or feel uncomfortable at a place I have to go to Monday through Friday.” Humphrey was not alone in his protest. His former classmates, in protest of the teacher, organized a walkout. The school’s president, Brother Thomas R. Leto confirmed that the teacher has since resigned and added, “Iona Preparatory does not condone for its students and will not accept from its faculty and staff.” More news from our partners: ‘They Know How to Treat Their White Children’: High School Security Supervisor Not Terminated for Kneeling on Black Teen’s Neck, Instead He’s Assigned to New San Diego School Being Tuned Into Their Customers’ Needs, Up-and-Coming Brooklyn Tea Shop Did a Successful Pandemic Pivot Time To Count Cam Newton Out | It’s Been A Hall of Fame Ride, But It’s Over…Respectfully",U.S./Atlanta Black Star,"‘Students Are Proud to Be Racists’: 16-Year-Old Experiences Racism at Indiana High School, Mom Pulls Her Out Despite White Students Being Suspended",https://news.yahoo.com/students-proud-racists-16-old-160000635.html
