4/3/2022,"April now. Spring is arriving in its blossom and pomp. Though not forgetting the threat of showers and the small fear of occasional frost. We are promised we’ll be back working on the plot this month. There’ll be much catching up to do. I had thought to sow early seed indoors to get ahead, but that has never much been how we work. Except perhaps for some early peas and beans. Even less so this year with the added uncertainty. Spring and summer will be a bit like a gardening blind date for us. Waiting to see what the drawn-back curtain reveals. A new love affair with new soil. We will add old manure and compost, perhaps some biodynamic preparations as soon as we can. But for you, dear readers, especially those in the south, April is the sowing starting gun. From beets and broad beans through celery, cabbages, carrots, the vegetable list is long. Leeks, lettuces, land cress to parsley, parsnips, peas, spring onions, spinach, swiss chard, turnips, on and on. An alphabet of sowing. Now I know from your comments some of you live, say, in Orkney and further afield and you’ll know better than me what to sow outside when and where. And when to cover. This is still a month to remember to check the long-range forecast. For the day to day, I use the BBC Weather app, and the Yr.no app, from the Norwegian weather institute. Both are more accurate than the farm worker who kept a close eye on crow activity when I was a Devon kid. Though he was almost never wrong. I have missed the peace the plot brings me. My need to sow and to grow is strong. Particularly in the quiet of early morning or in the company of others. I hope the foxes, the feral cats, the kestrels and robins haven’t been too disturbed. I’ll report back soon. Happy April. Allan Jenkins’s Plot 29 (4th Estate, £9.99) is out now.

4/3/2022,"When the Turkish entrepreneur Selman Turk launched a new digital bank three years ago, he was entering a crowded market of online start-ups hoping to grab business from the traditional banks. It seemed there was little to distinguish the new London-based venture, Heyman A, from a host of other contenders. It had a rudimentary website, meagre funding compared to some of its digital rivals and no banking licence. “We are building a good bank for good people,” said its website. A footnote added that it was “in the application process” to become a bank in the UK. But just seven months after the new venture was launched, a besuited Turk was on stage with the Duke of York at St James’s Palace collecting a people’s choice award in the prestigious Pitch@Palace event. The competition on 6 November 2019 was Prince Andrew’s version of the BBC show Dragons’ Den, but with a priceless royal cachet. It was a spectacular coup for former Goldman Sachs banker Turk and his fledgling bank, but did not secure the future of the firm, which was wound up in September last year. It emerged last week that Turk, 35, is being sued by a Turkish millionairess, Nebahat Evyap Isbilen, 77, who claims she was defrauded by him. She is seeking the return of about £38m. He disputes the allegations. Turk helped manage Isbilen’s financial affairs, and the court documents claim Turk instigated a payment of £750,000 to be made to Prince Andrew, just nine days after he picked up the award at St James’s Palace. The money, from Isbilen’s private bank account, has since been repaid, but raises new questions for Prince Andrew: were he and his advisers aware the payment was linked to Turk, and what was the money for? Prince Andrew is not central to the complex high court proceedings and is not accused of any wrongdoing. In her statements to the high court, Isbilen said she was told by Turk that the payment was a gift for Prince Andrew after it was claimed he helped arrange a replacement passport. She also said she had seen an email from Turk to her private bank, Hampden & Co, stating the payment was a wedding gift for Princess Beatrice, who married the property tycoon Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in July 2020. Isbilen has told the court she considered the claims concerning Prince Andrew’s purported role in arranging a passport or that the money transfer was a wedding gift were both false. In an extraordinary transcript of a call published by the Daily Mail yesterday, Amanda Thirsk, Prince Andrew’s former private secretary and the former director of Pitch@Palace, allegedly told a banker from Hampden & Co conducting compliance checks that she believed the money was a gift. She is claimed to have said: “I understand it’s a gift for the wedding…What she [Beatrice] and her family decide to do with it is really to do with them, isn’t it?” Thirsk told the Mail she could not recollect the call, but would not have been involved in anything improper. It has also been reported that Prince Andrew’s former wife, Sarah Ferguson, also received payments of at least £225,000 from Turk via a company called Alphabet Capital, said to be in connection with payment she was owed for her work with a solar power company. Her spokesperson has said she was completely unaware of the allegations which have now emerged. Isbilen is a member of the Turkish family that owns the Evyap group of companies, which has a range of soap and personal care brands. Her husband, Ilhan Isbilen, is the former deputy leader of the ruling AK party, and has been a political prisoner in Turkey since 2015. Isbilen says she gave Turk effective control of funds of $87.5m (£66.7m) and that he “dishonestly and systematically” abused the trust she placed in him. She said she had limited ability to understand English and required help to move her assets out of Turkey. She claims he dishonestly mismanaged her funds. Pitch@Palace was founded by the Duke of York in 2014 to “amplify and accelerate the work of entrepreneurs”. The programme had aimed to help businesspeople “make connections” and secure investment. Its future was, however, in peril at the time Turk picked up the award for his bank. Prince Andrew had given his notorious BBC Two Newsnight interview 10 days after the awards ceremony, triggering a public backlash. Companies including KPMG, Barclays, Bosch and Standard Chartered subsequently ended their sponsorship of Pitch@Palace. Its future activities are now under review. Prince Andrew’s spokesperson has said there will be no comment on an ongoing court case.",News/UK news,"Prince Andrew, the banker … and a mystery £750,000 ‘wedding gift’",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/03/prince-andrew-the-banker-and-a-mystery-750000-wedding-gift
4/3/2022,"More than four million refugees have fled Ukraine since Russia began its barbaric military campaign against the Ukrainian people just over a month ago. It has been described by the UN’s refugee agency as the fastest-growing refugee crisis since the Second World War. Poland is host to almost 2.5 million refugees, Romania just over 600,000, Moldova almost 400,000 and the whole of the EU has opened its borders to Ukrainian refugees, with no visa required. In contrast, the UK has issued fewer than 5,000 visas under the “Homes for Ukraine” scheme, not even a sixth of the number of applications. There are aspects of the government’s response to the crisis that are to be commended, but on the worsening refugee situation it has been astonishingly mean-spirited. In the early weeks, the only refugee resettlement route was for Ukrainians with family settled in the UK; at first, this only applied to immediate dependents, but now includes extended family. People using this process have reported significant delays, with family members having to finance extended hotel stays in countries bordering Ukraine while they wait for the Home Office bureaucracy to process visa applications. Eventually, the government bowed to public pressure to do more. Three weeks ago, it launched Homes for Ukraine, a scheme that allows Ukrainians to come to the UK if they are matched with a host to act as an individual sponsor for their visa and who can provide them with accommodation for at least six months (the host will be paid £350 a month by the government to do so). Under this scheme, refugees will get a three-year visa and be entitled to work and use public services in the UK. The requirement to be matched with a host falls far short of what the government should have done, which is to match the EU’s visa-free offer and provide independent housing for refugees so that their numbers are not limited by the amount of willing hosts or the time it takes to run checks, a prerequisite to processing a sponsor visa. The requirement for refugees to match with sponsors adds layers of bureaucratic delay and exploitative potential. Charities that work with refugees have warned that the lack of proper safeguards will create opportunities for those who seek to exploit Ukrainian women and children. They report UK-based human traffickers and slum landlords have already tried to target them. The government has been slow to establish any efforts to actually match refugees to hosts; it has only just announced funding for a pilot scheme. The government’s response to the crisis is a reflection of 20 years of hardening policy towards refugees and asylum seekers. It started under the last Labour government, whose ministers were all too happy to make political scapegoats out of refugees as a way of trying to boost its poll ratings, replacing cash support for asylum seekers with vouchers – later rolled back – and stoking public fears about “illegitimate” asylum seekers. But it has got much worse over the last decade under successive Conservative home secretaries, culminating in Priti Patel’s nationality and borders bill, which will create a two-tier asylum system that lawyers believe would break international and domestic law. It seeks to criminalise anyone arriving in the UK to claim asylum without a pre-approved claim, despite the fact that the 1951 Refugee Convention, to which Britain was a founding signatory, establishes the right of anyone with a legitimate claim to asylum to be heard fairly, regardless of how they arrive in a country. Meanwhile, the government has imposed far stricter than necessary limitations on resettlement schemes for Syrian and Afghan refugees over the last decade. Last year, 13,000 refugees in total were granted protection, the equivalent of just 20 people per parliamentary constituency. The Home Office has always been one of the poorer-performing departments, but Theresa May, as home secretary, made further sharpening of its cruel and inhuman bureaucracy a matter of government policy. In her efforts to make the UK as hostile an environment as possible for undocumented migrants, members of the Windrush generation who had lived, worked and paid taxes in the UK for decades found themselves cut off from the NHS, robbed of their right to work and even deported. At the same time, the government has made it ruinously expensive and bureaucratic for young people who have grown up in Britain to regularise their status when they turn 18, consigning those who cannot afford it to becoming undocumented. An independent report published last week by Wendy Williams, who conducted the independent review of Windrush, found the Home Office had resoundingly failed to improve its culture and was consequently at risk of another major crisis. Making cruel, inhumane and inflexible bureaucracy an integral aspect of government policy in order to try to drive down immigration and asylum numbers has had dreadful consequences. It has led to people who are British by any meaningful measure being denied basic rights and young people who have spent the majority of their childhood in Britain finding on turning 18 that they are not eligible for the same educational support as their peers. It has rendered the state incapable of fulfilling its ethical obligations to people fleeing conflict and torture in countries such as Syria, Afghanistan and Ukraine. Incremental reform will not do: the UK’s immigration and asylum system needs to be dismantled and rebuilt from scratch.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on Britain’s cruel and unfit refugee policy | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/03/the-observer-view-on-britain-cruel-unfit-refugee-policy
4/3/2022,"The question I am happily married with a toddler and a baby. During my 20s, I was sure I wanted to have children, by my early 30s I decided I didn’t. I met my husband at 35 and was unexpectedly pregnant less than 12 months later. We were both pleased and I put my decision not to have children down to the depression I had suffered. Now that I have children, I’m not so sure that was right. I love my children and husband, but I often wish I wasn’t a mother. I hanker for my early 30s when I lived in a great house share and had a good job. It feels ridiculous to crave that period in my life because that was when I was depressed. I had some group therapy, but had to give it up earlier than planned because it made me too anxious. I have a good life now, but I feel tormented. I worry about being able to provide for my children, and what kind of world I have brought them into. My husband rightly says that it is my anxiety that makes things difficult for me – our actual situation is fine. How can I learn to accept and get on with my life and just “be”? Philippa’s answer I want to tell you from my heart that you truly have both hands full with two young children. That is not easy. I expect among the joys of first smiles, steps, words and deepening bonds, there is a lot of sleeplessness, drudgery and emotional labour. I have never met anyone cut out for that part, but it is made worthwhile, or perhaps just bearable, if you can see it as an investment of love in their future. The paediatrician and psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott was the first to point out how normal it is to feel resentment towards our children at times. It’s not surprising you can wish you weren’t a mother – it’s 24/7 with no days off. Somebody once said that having children was a bit like watching football: you suffer 90 minutes of nothing happening, but your team scores a goal in the last minute and you come away euphoric and say it was a great match. You will forget the standing for over an hour in the cold and the boredom, and cling on to the joy. You are at the most time-consuming part of parenting now – you will get more of your life back. To cope with life, what we unconsciously do is try to make the inevitable uncertainties more certain. We do this by feeling, then “knowing” (when we can’t really know, but like to feel we do). We form categories so we can file ourselves, each other and our experiences into tidy boxes. We turn what is inchoate into language to pin it down and we create narratives and meanings that make us feel less unsure. We also remember, forget and fantasise to order our experiences and protect ourselves from the existential given of uncertainty. Any sudden adjustments we have to make – parenthood is one such adjustment – can cause us to become even more intolerant of uncertainty and compelled to tie life down into neat parcels of foregone conclusions. Our challenge is to become more comfortable with not knowing. We do this by resisting having to categorise and pin everything down, and by remaining curious. It is normal to catastrophise, because if you imagine the worst happening you won’t be shocked by it if it does – but to do so steals your life as it is no fun to live in a catastrophic fantasy. This is why one of my favourite therapy catchphrases is: “If you are going to have a fantasy, make it a good one.” I wonder if you had catastrophic fantasies about your group therapy, which is why you stopped going. It may sound easy to resist having to predict the future or only have good fantasies, but it takes discipline and practice. You will often catch yourself staring at a hypothetical ditch and imagining you and everyone you love ending up in it. But you need to realise that to have such a fantasy is a choice, and one you need to stop making. Every time you notice yourself doing this, don’t tell yourself off, but congratulate yourself on having caught it. Worry is not necessarily bad when it leads to problem-solving, but worrying when it only produces self-torture is a waste of life. You want to just be. To do this, notice your intolerance to not knowing things and outcomes, and your propensity to try to ward this off with catastrophic fantasising. When you are in the habit of noticing it, then you can learn to distance yourself from it, which will control it. Being a mother isn’t being just one type of person. You are you. None of us is set in stone – humans are more flexible and changing than that. Forget the categories and don’t file yourself away.

4/3/2022,"Claw & Hammer, 30-33 Minories, London EC3N 1DD (020 7702 1605). Small plates £7.50-£14, mains and hot pots £16.50-£29, desserts £5.50, wines from £22 Do not go to Claw & Hammer on a date. Or to be more exact, do not go to Claw & Hammer on a first date. Go on a seventh or eighth date, when the deed has been done, and you’ve already seen each other being about as messy and human as it’s possible to be. Then this restaurant on the eastern edge of the City of London, which specialises in southern US seafood boils, will be just the thing. Because this is very much a hands-on, up-to-your-armpits place. The food is so gloriously prone to chaos and disorder that the main events are delivered not just with crab claw crackers and crabmeat picks, but also with blue latex gloves. “Although I wouldn’t bother with the gloves,” our cheery, cheerleading waiter said. I told him I wasn’t planning to. I’d come for dinner, not to perform an internal examination. Wet wipes would do me fine. I noted that those on other tables who had gloved up, were still able to scroll on their phones. They were probably Instagramming, which is very important in a place like this. Just look at the size of those king shrimp, and so on. It did, however, make them look like they were hunting down a differential diagnosis, while getting deep into the seafood action. Claw & Hammer shouldn’t work. Seafood boils tend to draw much of their impact from context. You want gnarly wooden picnic tables spread with newspaper or at the very least spread with paper designed to look like newsprint, perhaps filled with fake stories referencing someone called Bubba or Fat Al. You want 100% humidity and forearms glistening lightly with sweat, and permission to get properly stuck in. The one time I did a seafood boil in rural Louisiana, I carried away with me the sultry waft of roasted prawn head and boiled crab shell for the rest of the day, as if it was an especially obscure eau de cologne designed specifically for the belly-obsessed. Who needs Givenchy Pour Homme Blue Label, when you can wander around smelling like a bowl of spicy bouillabaisse? The interior of Claw & Hammer has a lot of raw wood panelling, as well as bare-brick walls overlaid with wire grids. It’s designed to convince you that you’re in an authentically hard-scrabble, pseudo-industrial place where nobody need stand, or sit, on ceremony. Naturally enough, the ceiling’s industrial workings are on show. Look at the ducts on that. In truth, of course, it’s just another blunt restaurant unit on a less than lovely commercial street near Aldgate. Until last year it was home to a branch of Randy’s Wing Bar, which did what its name suggests. The people behind Randy’s decided the future at this outpost of their mini-empire lay not with wings, but with legs and claws. Put all those antecedents together and you could be forgiven for assuming this to be a grim, ersatz exercise in separating bored restaurant-goers from their money. It’s not. The food is terrific. Thought and care has gone into the tight menu. Whoever came up with the dishes knows how to feed and appears to be pretty damn fluent in the culinary vernacular of the southern US. There are oysters to start, both naked and dressed, perhaps with a smoked jalapeño salsa and a spritz of lime, or their own buffalo sauce and a dice of pickled celery. We have three of them grilled under a powerful buttery broth, flavoured enthusiastically with Worcestershire sauce, smoked paprika, cayenne, lemon and tarragon. Cooking oysters like this makes them only more explosively themselves: sweeter, plumper, saltier and deeply redolent of the sea they once called home. Alongside these, we have a couple of chunky king shrimp, split and accurately grilled with what they call “escargot butter”. Given that it would work just as well with snails as it does here, the title is a fair one. There’s garlic in there, and parsley and garlic and Pernod and garlic and a little lemon. And some garlic. Hence, the instruction to come here on your eighth date. You need to dine with someone you can breathe on later without embarrassment. At the heart of the menu are their hotpots: boisterous, Cajun-spiced broths, lightly thickened with the noble wonder that is the Louisiana roux, that gracious interplay of fat and flour cooked out together which underpins so much of this sort of food. The rust-coloured broth bobs with chunks of corn cob, red potato and smoked sausage, to which your chosen seafood is added. There’s mussels and shrimp in the New Orleans; crab claws and shrimp in the Alabama; and snow crab, clams and mussels for the Louisiana. A single serving of the New Orleans costs £21 or you can share for £35. The pricing works upwards from there. I have no idea what these regional titles have to do with the contents. Maybe they just wanted to prove they know the names of some places in America. There’s also a vegetarian version called the Mississippi, filled with butternut squash, grilled asparagus and okra, presumably aimed at non-meat eaters who really like hanging out with their pescatarian friends. What matters here is that they are huge, edible Fisher-Price Activity Centers for grownups. You are never alone with one of these hotpots: ooh, I can suck on this bit; ah, I can peel that bit; my, I can poke around in there for the sweetest of sweet white crabmeat. We have a side of their corn bread, which is ordered solely as a vehicle for a pot of their melted lobster butter. It is concentrated essence of lobster dissolved in hot butter, a fine union which deserves to be blessed and celebrated. We wanted a side of the steamed French beans, but they’d run out. So there’s nothing green on the menu tonight? Our waiter shrugged. He suggested we have the tempura vegetables. Deep-fried broccoli? We decide to get our vitamins from the potatoes and corn. Reader, we lived. At the end there was a serviceable sticky toffee pudding with a bourbon caramel. The New Orleans bread pudding, made with crisp layers of sugared croissant, was much more than serviceable. It was an airy, sweet and friable wonder, and a bargain at £5.50. I’ve made it clear that visiting Claw & Hammer was a punt on my part. I loved the way the menu read online, but I had no expectation that this place, in this location, with these antecedents could deliver. I am delighted to say I was wrong. It’s been a while coming, but finally it’s happening: Cardiff’s cult Japanese food outlet Matsudai Ramen, which made its name through hugely popular meal kits delivered nationwide during the pandemic, has finally acquired a permanent site. Self-proclaimed ramen fan James Chant will open Matsudai Ramen at the Bank in a former branch of NatWest on the edge of Cardiff City Centre in the early summer. Alongside his range of ramen, there will be a set of other dishes including his karaage chicken and his karaage mushrooms.

4/3/2022,"As Joe Biden moved to open US strategic oil reserves, his two biggest oil-producing allies have kept their tanks firmly shut. The UAE and Saudi Arabia continue to rebuff the US president as he attempts to counter soaring oil prices prompted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. And both countries have been unusually frank about their refusal to step in. The five-week-old war is bringing tensions to a head in several parts of the world, but perhaps nowhere is a regional order more under strain than the Middle East, where two of America’s biggest allies are now seriously questioning the foundations of their relationship. The Saudi and Emirati refusal to bail Biden out – or even to take his calls – has pushed relations between the Gulf states and Washington to an unprecedented low. The extraordinary flow of Russian wealth to Dubai, just as the US and Europe try to strangle Putin’s economy, has inflamed things further. Add to that the still-sputtering talks between Washington and Tehran, which could see sanctions reprieves in return for Iran returning to the Obama-era nuclear deal, and there are clear signs of a faltering friendship – with the potential to rewrite the geopolitics of the region. Usually opaque and often inscrutable, officials in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh have in recent weeks been uncharacteristically blunt to visiting diplomats about the nature of their grievances, and how far they are prepared to take them. One western diplomat told the Guardian that a Saudi counterpart had said: “This is the end of the road for us and Biden, but maybe the US also.” Prominent Saudi and Emirati commentators shared the same sentiments. The former al-Arabiya editor-in-chief, Mohammed al-Yahya chose the previously unlikely forum of the Jerusalem Post to publish his views on the standoff. “The Saudi-US relationship is in the throes of a crisis,” he wrote. “I am increasingly disturbed by the unreality of the American discussion about the subject, which often fails to acknowledge just how deep and serious the rift has grown. “A more realistic discussion should focus on one word: divorce. When Barack Obama negotiated the nuclear deal with Iran, we Saudis understood him to be seeking the breakup of a 70-year marriage. “How could we not? After all, the flaws in the deal are well known. It paves a path for Iran to a nuclear bomb. It fills the war chest of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which has spread militias across the Arab world armed with precision-guided munitions to maim and kill people who formerly looked to America to help guarantee their safety. “Why should America’s regional allies help Washington contain Russia in Europe when Washington is strengthening Russia and Iran in the Middle East?” Al-Yahya contrasted Washington’s demands with Beijing’s no-strings diplomacy, saying: “While American policy is beset by baffling contradictions, Chinese policy is simple and straightforward. Beijing is offering Riyadh a simple deal: sell us your oil and choose whatever military equipment you want from our catalogue; in return, help us to stabilise global energy markets. “In other words, the Chinese are offering what increasingly appears modelled on the American-Saudi deal that stabilised the Middle East for 70 years.” In recent months, Brett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East, has been a frequent visitor to Riyadh, trying to calibrate a relationship that soured soon after Biden’s inauguration, when he refused to speak to Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader, Mohammed bin Salman. That stance set the tone for the standoff that has followed. And both Prince Mohammed and his counterpart in the UAE, Mohamed bin Zayed, remain deeply wary of the administration’s determination to push through the nuclear deal, which would give Iran comprehensive sanctions relief in return for abandoning the capacity to build a nuclear weapon. A perceived lack of support from Washington for the Saudi-led campaign against Houthis in Yemen has added to the angst. And so too has an approach of an administration that Riyadh and Abu Dhabi believe is willing to sacrifice allies for idealism. The naked transactional diplomacy of Donald Trump was a formula more familiar to both, and had been readily deployed by China, to whom each is looking towards for closer trade, energy and even security ties. Professor Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a noted scholar in political science, described the crisis with Washington as the worst in “50 years”. He laid a litany of gripes at the doors of the White House, which he said had built up particularly during the Biden administration. Writing in the Lebanese daily Annahar, he said: “The UAE’s relationship with the US partner is at stake, at a crossroads. It is certain that the task of fixing the misunderstanding falls on the shoulders of the Biden administration, which may be on the verge of losing a regional partner that is increasingly self-confident and has an increasing regional and global presence. “The UAE has invested a lot in its relations with Washington. We allocated the bulk of our investments of huge sovereign wealth funds in the American markets, excluding Asian and European markets, and had wanted to increase trade with Washington.” Abdulla said the UAE felt snubbed by Washington not signing a deal to supply new F-35 fighter jets.It was also angered by Biden’s distance following a deadly Houthi drone and rocket strike on Abu Dhabi. “What made matters worse was the Biden administration’s objection to sovereign Emirati decisions, such as receiving Bashar al-Assad … and putting pressure on Abu Dhabi to increase its oil production outside the context of the Opec agreement. “All this comes at a time when America is no longer the only superpower in the world, which prompted the UAE and other countries to diversify partners.”",News/US news,Biden rebuffed as US relations with Saudi Arabia and UAE hit new low,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/03/us-relations-saudi-arabia-uae-oil-crisis
4/3/2022,"On Friday, Amazon – America’s wealthiest, most powerful and fiercest anti-union corporation, with the second-largest workforce in the nation (union-busting Walmart being the largest), lost out to a group of warehouse workers in New York who voted to form a union. If anyone had any doubts about Amazon’s determination to prevent this from ever happening, its scorched-earth anti-union campaign last fall in its Bessemer, Alabama, warehouse should have put those doubts to rest. In New York, Amazon used every tool it had used in Alabama. Many of them are illegal under the National Labor Relations Act but Amazon couldn’t care less. It’s rich enough to pay any fine or bear any public relations hit. The company has repeatedly fired workers who speak out about unsafe working conditions or who even suggest that workers need a voice. As its corporate coffers bulge with profits – and its founder and executive chairman practices conspicuous consumption on the scale not seen since the robber barons of the late 19th century – Amazon has become the poster child for 21st-century corporate capitalism run amok. Much of the credit for Friday’s victory over Amazon goes to Christian Smalls, whom Amazon fired in the spring of 2020 for speaking out about the firm’s failure to protect its warehouse workers from Covid. Smalls refused to back down. He went back and organized a union, with extraordinary skill and tenacity. Smalls had something else working in his favor, which brings me to Friday’s superb jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The report showed that the economy continues to roar back to life from the Covid recession. With consumer demand soaring, employers are desperate to hire. This has given American workers more bargaining clout than they’ve had in decades. Wages have climbed 5.6% over the past year. The acute demand for workers has bolstered the courage of workers to demand better pay and working conditions from even the most virulently anti-union corporations in America, such as Amazon and Starbucks. Is this something to worry about? Not at all. American workers haven’t had much of a raise in over four decades. Most of the economy’s gains have gone to the top. Besides, inflation is running so high that even a 5.6% wage gain over the past year is minimal in terms of real purchasing power. But corporate America believes these wage gains are contributing to inflation. As the New York Times solemnly reported, the wage gains “could heat up price increases”. This is pure rubbish. Unfortunately, the chair of the Federal Reserve Board, Jerome Powell, believes it. He worries that “the labor market is extremely tight” and to “an unhealthy level”. As a result, the Fed is on the way to raising interest rates repeatedly in order to slow the economy and reduce the bargaining leverage of American workers. Pause here to consider this: the commerce department reported on Wednesday that corporate profits are at a 70-year high. You read that right. Not since 1952 have corporations done as well as they are now doing. Amazon’s profits are in the stratosphere, but it’s not just Amazon. Across the board, American corporations are flush with cash. Although they are paying higher costs (including higher wages), they’ve still managed to increase their profits. How? They have enough pricing power to pass on those higher costs to consumers, and even add some more for themselves. When American corporations are overflowing with money like this, why would wage gains heat up price increases, as the Times reports? In a healthy economy, corporations would not be passing on higher costs – including higher wages – to their consumers. They’d be paying the higher wages out of their profits. But that’s not happening. Corporations are using their record profits to buy back enormous amounts of their own stock to keep their share prices high, instead. The labor market isn’t “unhealthily” tight, as Jerome Powell asserts; corporations are unhealthily fat. Workers don’t have too much power; corporations do. The extraordinary win of the workers of Amazon’s Staten Island warehouse is cause for celebration. Let’s hope it marks the beginning of a renewal of worker power in America. Yet the reality is that corporate America doesn’t want to give up any of its record profits to its workers. If it can’t fight off unions directly, it will do so indirectly by blaming inflation on wage increases, and then cheer on the Fed as it slows the economy just enough to eliminate American workers’ new bargaining clout.",Opinion/Opinion,After Amazon workers’ union victory the Fed must stop tipping the scales for bosses | Robert Reich,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/03/amazon-workers-union-victory-federal-reserve-corporate-profits
4/3/2022,"The P&O human resources strategy shows how detrimental it is to treat experienced employees as expendable and to abandon human values even in a financial crisis (“No sea experience needed, says agency ad for P&O crews”, News). As an Isle of Wight resident, during lockdown when our cross-Solent transport services were under extreme financial pressure, I saw the value of collaborative ethical leadership to keep us connected to the mainland and ensure all passengers, especially key workers, had access to their workplaces. As a member of the Hover Travel User Group, I heard how the company reached out to assist ambulance services to transport patients quickly to the mainland. The crew underwent rigorous training and many seriously ill patients have benefited. The group, drawn from commuters, health charities and support groups, schools and island traders, is consulted about changes to practice. Its advice and suggestions are taken seriously and often implemented. The company knows it doesn’t get it right all the time, but works with customers to alleviate difficulties. Such openness and service to the community ensure that we and the company survived turbulent times. Perhaps there’s a lesson there for P&O.Yvonne WilliamsRyde, Isle of Wight Rana Mitter observes that Russia’s elites consider China nekulturny, or uncultured, having never produced a Dostoevsky (“China-Russian relations carry deep memories of mutual respect… and scorn”, Comment). China might do well, in the spirit of “friendship without limits”, to remind its new friends that the author of The Gambler and The Idiot also wrote Crime and Punishment.Austen LynchGarstang, Lancashire Your article about cycling and walking infrastructure plans (“Get on your bike? Not if some Tory councils have their way…”, News) makes no mention of ill thought-out schemes, introduced without any equality impact assessment. Where I live, planters (glorified packing cases) and benches (who wants to sit in the road?) have been used to obstruct parking places, preventing people with impaired mobility from accessing shops and facilities.Janet MearnsLondon W3 The sun doesn’t always shine, the wind doesn’t always blow, but the tide reliably goes in and out every day. Why was tidal power not mentioned in your piece on the choices we have as sources of energy? It now seems very shortsighted to have abandoned the Severn Estuary scheme. Whatever the cost then, it would be good value now.Sue HumphriesYork Nick Cohen’s scathing article deriding those he regards as Russian defenders/apologists/propagandists is most notable for its condemnation of the moral hypocrisy afflicting people who “excoriate the double standards of democracies while excusing or ignoring the crimes of dictatorships” (“Collaboration thrives on everyday vanity and ambition. Just look at RT’s wannabes”, Comment). This presents only one part of a circular debate. To many, those who unflinchingly condemn the actions of the Russian state while ignoring the death, destruction and displacement wreaked by unlawful, western-led invasions or sustained illegal occupations perpetrated by their allies epitomise everything that Cohen decries.Nick CusackPaisley, Renfrewshire I have worked in or alongside children’s social care for many years and remember when privatisation was first promoted (“Revealed: top 10 children’s care providers made £300m profits”, News). Rather like academies and free schools, the rhetoric was handing over control, whether to experienced childcare workers, parents or teachers; rescuing services from bureaucratic control. Gradually, private equity has taken over and cost-cutting started to maximise profit. One such move was to sell the properties in the urban areas where the children had grown up and replace them with cheaper alternatives, often disused farmhouses and remote cottages, frequently detached from communities. Local authorities placing vulnerable children have to take what is on offer. When a child needs a placement is when there should be a suitable vacancy but, to maximise profit, facilities need to be full most of the time. This is where the problem arises, which only financial investment can resolve; profit means limiting vacancies, while choice and availability require carrying vacancies in the system. Add the fact that the millions of pounds of profit going to shareholders is all taxpayers’ money, provided to care for vulnerable children, and we have a clear example of why we should not be privatising public services.Roy GrimwoodMarket Drayton, Shropshire While agreeing with the general argument in Kenan Malik’s insightful article (“As the imperial ties are being cast aside, a royal tour was always going to be a farce”, Comment), his reference to the Chagos Islanders was misleading. In fact, the extension of citizenship to descendants of those shamefully evicted from the Chagos Islands is the result of effective campaigning by Chagossians themselves. Their campaign resulted in a Lords amendment to the appalling nationality and borders bill that was passed by more than 80 votes, with strong support from all benches including the Conservatives. This, together with the support in the Commons of Henry Smith MP, led to the government concession. The campaigns for the Chagossians’ right to return to their homeland and for citizenship are not and should not be mutually exclusive.Baroness (Ruth) Lister of BurtersettHouse of LordsLondon SW1 Thanks to Will Hutton for drawing attention to the catastrophic economic impact of Brexit with the words “the reign of silence on Brexit – and that includes you, Labour party – means the damage goes unnoticed and uncriticised” (“For brazen cynicism, I have seen nothing like Sunak’s plan in 40 years”, Comment). Elsewhere in the paper, reports such as 400 people a week leaving the NHS and the substantial erosion of teachers’ salaries highlight the pressure on public finances and the need to explore every possible option for raising the necessary tax revenues. In this context, any rational government or prospective government should surely re-examine the self-imposed Brexit, an issue that is forecast to have a net cost to public finances of £30bn a year, or, to put it another way, around £570m a week less to spend on the NHS. The need for a re-examination is reinforced by the polls indicating that people are increasingly starting to realise the cost of Brexit, with three to one now considering it bad for the economy.David NewensGreat Linford, Milton KeynesBuckinghamshire As a huge fan of Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlet, I was sad to read of Gerry Anderson’s difficult childhood (“Why Mother’s Day was no cause to celebrate for creator of Thunderbirds”, News).

4/3/2022,"Hacks (Amazon Prime) | amazon.co.ukGordon Ramsay’s Future Food Stars (BBC One) | iPlayerFalklands War: The Untold Story (Channel 4) | channel4.comOpen House: The Great Sex Experiment (Channel 4) | channel4.com I’ve been drooling out of both sides of my mouth since hearing about Hacks, the award-garlanded dramedy, created by Lucia Aniello, Paul W Downs and Jen Statsky (all involved in Broad City, originally shown on Comedy Central). It has finally reached these shores (via Amazon Prime) almost a year after its launch in the US. Jean Smart (Mare of Easttown; Fargo) won a Golden Globe and an Emmy for her portrayal of veteran Las Vegas comic Deborah Vance, whose career has become a death rattle of sparkly trouser suits, dusty one-liners and QVC hustles. With her Vegas residency threatened, Vance comes across as an upcycled Norma Desmond meets a crankier Joan Rivers: there’s the sulphurous whiff of faded glories as she shuffles around her plasterboard Versailles mansion, but she’s damned if she’s going to go quietly. Enter Ava Daniels (Hannah Einbinder), a twentysomething LA writer, who’s tanked her career with an ill-judged tweet and who tells Vance at their fractious first meeting: “The last thing on Earth I want to do is move to the desert to write lame jokes for an old hack.” What unfolds is an odd-couple generational psychodrama cum showbiz redemption story that runs on fear – of ageing and failure – but stamps on sentimentality with hobnail boots. Set mainly on the boulevard of slot machines and shattered dreams that is Vegas, over 10 episodes, Hacks is chock-full of scene-stealers, including Deborah’s dizzy daughter (Kaitlin Olson), and the sparky double act of agent Jimmy and assistant Kayla, played by Downs and Megan Stalter. But it’s Smart and Einbinder’s spreading bruise of a relationship that keeps you riveted. Comedies about comedy sometimes choke on their own meta – is it funny or “funny”? – but here, the creative grind is only the start. Daniels may be a know-it-all Gen Z-er who despairs of her new gig (“Ava, she needs jokes on side salad”), but she has the fresh eye (comedy, feminism, life) Vance needs. Vance might be a muumuu-clad monster, but she’s also a shrewd motivational fireball, at one point hissing at Daniels: “You have to scratch and claw and it never fucking ends!” There’s a mid-series lull, where the intense comic energy slumps, but, generally, Hacks socks a vigorous tragicomic punch. Transcending the average dramedy, it evolves into an examination of co-dependency writ large on Vegas billboards; blood on the dressing room floor. Has TV chef Gordon Ramsay finally stopped shouting? Watching his new BBC One eight-part series, Gordon Ramsay’s Future Food Stars, I was struck by the eerie calm and that’s factoring in Ramsay making an entrance by jumping into the Cornish sea from a helicopter. The point, it seems, is “leaps of faith” and, soon enough, 12 food and drink entrepreneurs are throwing themselves from Cornish rocks into seawater to avoid getting sent home first and to prove they’re worthy of the final prize of Ramsay’s £150,000 investment. “My own money!” he keeps insisting, as if unable to believe it himself. Some of the entrepreneurs are vegan, which surprises me: I remember Ramsay, years ago, on a previous show, tricking a vegetarian man into eating Parma ham on a pizza, behaviour that was… (excuse me, the lawyers need a word)… erm, entirely open to your own personal interpretation. It seems either Ramsay is a changed man or he’s belatedly twigged the worth of the tempeh pound. As for the shouting, Ramsay’s onscreen eruptions were once infamous, but, here, he seems more measured and therefore more credible and watchable. Food Stars itself comes across as somewhat derivative – The Apprentice with a full tummy and a pinch of Million Pound Menu thrown in? – but it’s not without interest and amusement. Watching contestants compete by running street-food stalls on the beach, “strong characters” (let’s call them that) are already starting to emerge amid the mounds of soggy tacos and overpriced toasties. While this show is ostensibly about food, we’ll doubtless be watching for the folly and misguided ambition. Considering global events right now, Harvey Lilley’s feature-length documentary, Falklands War: The Untold Story (Channel 4) made for sobering viewing. Certainly, there seemed little of the wearisome triumphalism that was around at that time as mainly military types, including General Sir Michael Rose (the SAS leader who negotiated the Argentinian surrender), looked back on Britain’s conflict with Argentina, 40 years on. It made for an unflinching, raw 90 minutes, with mistakes and those who made them rigorously criticised, justifiably so, considering the hundreds of casualties. Elsewhere, there were chilling accounts of miscommunication, dysfunctional chains of command, men forced to “wing it” and comrades who tragically didn’t survive, while Argentinian participants gave their own views. As people told their stories in this documentary, some for the very first time, there was a feeling of grief and sorrow, but also relief: the sense of a locked and rusty MoD door being yanked open after a very long time. On to the new Channel 4 series, Open House: The Great Sex Experiment, which features couples interested in polyamory, threesomes, group sex and the like as part of committed relationships. I was hoping to feel deeply morally offended – TV critics get our kicks where we can – but the first episode was responsibly executed, with couples mixing at “socials” with “sexually liberated” residents and progress overseen by specialist relationship therapist Lori Beth Bisbey. There isn’t even much nudity, give or take the odd shot of male buttocks in the night-vision murk. Confusingly, there’s no mention of swinging – even historically – is the “s” word banned now? Moreover, at times, the exercise feels over-polite, even corporate, as though human sexuality could somehow be processed and admin-ed. Still, serious points are made about liberation and its evil twin, sexual jealousy. When a young Welsh couple try a threesome, the man emerges feeling like a “spare part” and the couple tetchily argue in the dark. (Don’t worry: they go on to have successful threesomes.) Thus far, I’m not sure what Open House… is precisely saying about open relationships, but it’s nice to know that romance isn’t dead, it’s just wearing furry handcuffs and refusing to be oppressed by societal mores.

4/3/2022,"“Makes Chernobyl look like the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.” “A concrete fungus.” “Could it not be carefully dismantled and reconstructed at the bottom of the North Sea?” This is some of the recent social media reaction on the subject of Cumbernauld town centre, once internationally celebrated, an ambitious but battered 1960s building designed to house several functions, especially shopping. North Lanarkshire council wants to demolish it. Architectural experts, on the other hand, think it should be kept – the Financial Times’s critic called the council’s decision “a complete outrage”; “cowardly and wasteful,” said Barnabas Calder, an architectural historian at the University of Liverpool. The Twentieth Century Society, which seeks to defend significant buildings of the centre’s epoch, “would very much regret its demolition”. Welcome to the culture wars, as applied to architectural heritage. It’s The People v The Experts, the caricature goes, a case of long-suffering locals being told by outsiders that they have to live with an architectural cadaver. Rightwing media outlets and fury factories crow over this “massive gulf” between popular and professional taste. Nadine Dorries, within hours of becoming culture secretary, pointedly removed the listed status of the Dorman Long Tower, a relic of Redcar’s steel-working heritage, such that it could be demolished by developers. Like most caricatures, it’s not all accurate – Preston’s brutalist bus station, for example, which opened in 1969, was preserved with at least some local support – but in the case of Cumbernauld public feeling is unequivocally in favour of demolition. As an architectural critic, I’m usually on the side of embattled brutalism, trying to point out virtues concealed by neglect. But not this time – the building’s magnificence seems irrecoverable and its problems too blatant. When I tour the centre, asking users for their views on its proposed removal, the reactions are unanimous: “not before time”; “it’s so unsightly”; “it’s horrible”. “Oh no, I doubt it very much,” says a librarian in the centre’s public library, when I ask her if I’ll find anyone who would want to keep it. Some Cumbernauldians speak fondly of a place that was “pivotal” when they were younger, the “epicentre of childhood in the 1980s”, but even most of them feel it is time for it to go. “I loved the building, growing up, even though it was ugly,” says Kirkland Ciccone, author of a Cumbernauld-based novel called Happiness Is Wasted on Me. “I loved the weirdness.” But now, he tells me, “we’re desperate to see it go”. As often in tales of modernist dereliction, it started with high hopes. Cumbernauld New Town, located about 13 miles out of Glasgow towards Edinburgh, was built from the 1950s on to ease overcrowding in the old industrial city and offer a better, healthier life to escapees from smoky streets. Much of it, as seen in the tender 1981 teen romance Gregory’s Girl, is low-rise and low-density, with little rows of houses carefully landscaped over undulant terrain. The town centre, part beast in appearance and part machine, a concrete acropolis presiding over the town, was something else. Designed by a team led by the architect Geoffrey Copcutt (“an amazing man”, according to a colleague and “wild in every way: wild beard, wild hair… suits like carpets”), it was a thing of vision. It was a megastructure. This meant that many uses – a shopping centre, a bus station, a town hall, library, homes – were wrapped up in a single composition. It stretched long and linear beside a dual carriageway, at one point also straddling it with a multi-level bridge. Intricate foothills of ramps and platforms resolved at the top into a ruler-straight human-made horizon, a kind of inhabited viaduct that, oversailing at each end on to high concrete stalks, contained penthouse apartments for the town’s high-livers. Princess Margaret opened it to worldwide attention in 1967. It was billed as the world’s first multi-level covered shopping centre. “A soaring citadel in a meadow,” gushed Harper’s magazine before it was completed, worthy of the visions of Leonardo da Vinci, where “man” might “move freely in the sun”. The town figured in TV shows and movies. The extent to which it was ever a complete success is debatable, but time has not been kind to it. Those penthouses, perhaps too far ahead of their time to find a market, were made into offices, which are now empty and locked up. The interiors were despairingly made over with suspended ceilings and faintly postmodern plasterboard motifs. Eventually, the building was partly demolished so that the Antonine shopping centre could be added, a bang-average retail development that relates not at all, architecturally speaking, to its older neighbour. In the 2000s, the centre started winning prizes for Scotland’s worst building (the Carbuncle award, twice) and helped Cumbernauld win prizes for worst town (the Plook on the Plinth award, also twice). According to Adam Smith, local activist and chronicler, the town is “a great place to live” – 50% of it green space, with ancient woodlands and historic buildings – which has “unfairly been given a really bad reputation. People who have never been to Cumbernauld ask where you’re from and then you get that sympathetic look.” A lot of that, he believes, is because the main route through the town is the dual carriageway around which the centre is built, such that passing traffic only get to see its “dark and dingy undercroft and delivery yards”. It is almost impossible, if you visit it now, to find a part of it that is not a problem. Those meadows are mostly car parks or other left-over places and approaches take you via laborious ramps from peeling and echoing netherworlds to retail zones that, even on a Saturday, are sparsely used. Even if you’re looking for whatever architectural magic it has to offer, you struggle. Much of it is smothered by those makeovers. The soaring projections of that top-level viaduct, glimpsed with a little effort across service areas, are as good as it gets. Other problems include the gathering of buckets under roofs in wet weather, the obscure location of the library and resulting loss of passing trade, the discouraging effects on elderly people of unreliable lifts, the intimidating feeling of the circulation areas after dark, especially to women. The bus station, a fluorescent-lit cave next to the big road, is grim. The building being cast in reinforced concrete, and for all that the design was supposed to be open to change, is inflexible, hard to adapt and to fix. Many of these flaws might be blamed on poor management of the centre since it was built and clumsy alterations to it, but not all. For, despite the daring and optimism of 1960s architects, structures such as Cumbernauld town centre tended to have common faults: hostile spaces at ground level, confusing layouts, high energy consumption, difficulties of maintenance. As for the concept of the megastructure, the benefits of putting diverse uses in a single construction, as opposed to in different if proximate buildings, were never clearly demonstrated. So it seems conclusive: the balance of benefits to costs in keeping it, of weighing a vestigial buzz of architectural ambition against numerous failings, comes down on the side of replacement. But there is still the question of embodied carbon – of the effect on climate of discarding huge quantities of concrete and steel , a relatively new but significant factor in debates about old structures. Calder, who has written books both on brutalism and the climate implications of architecture, says: “At least tens of thousands of tonnes of carbon are still in the atmosphere from the time of the centre’s construction. Its replacement will automatically have a substantial carbon footprint.” He notes that North Lanarkshire council has declared a climate emergency. The onus is therefore on them, he argues, to show they are not needlessly contributing to that emergency. Better, he says, to find some “really good architects” who, by creatively reusing the existing fabric, can once again make Cumbernauld a global exemplar of architecture. The Twentieth Century Society similarly calls for “a radical reinvention of what remains, which would be more environmentally friendly and in keeping with the ethos of its creation”. Arguments like this are dear to my heart and one could certainly hope for better than the bland, could-be-anywhere boxes that the council have offered by way of illustration of what the replacement could be like. But I find them hard to believe in relation to Cumbernauld town centre. The building breathes awkwardness from every pore, so recalcitrant that adaptation seems futile. At the very least, though, thoughtfulness and evidence are called for. In which case, it would help if cases like this were removed from the conflict zones of the culture wars. Fans of brutalism should for their part refrain from accusations of outrage when local authorities propose what looks to most like common sense. When almost everyone in Cumbernauld tells them that they want the old town centre gone, they should pay attention. To do otherwise is a gift to the Nadine Dorrieses of this world.",Arts/Art and design,Rip it up and start again?
