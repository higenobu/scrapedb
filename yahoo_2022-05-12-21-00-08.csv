5/12/2022,"Ukrainian troops found Russian military documents in Sumy Oblast, officials said on Telegram. The abandoned military documents suggest that Putin had plans to seize all of Ukraine. Russian troops retreated from Kyiv in early April and have since focused on taking eastern Ukraine. Fleeing Russian soldiers left behind key military documents that indicate Russia's President Vladimir Putin had plans to seize all of Ukraine, the director of Ukraine's State Bureau of Investigation said in a Telegram statement on Wednesday. Ukrainian forces discovered the documents while searching through the northeastern town of Trostyanets in Sumy Oblast, the statement said. Trostyanets, located around 230 miles from the capital Kyiv, was liberated by Ukrainian troops in late March after a month-long Russian occupation, The New York Times reported. Investigators found ""important documents of soldiers of the Russian Federation's Armed Forces that give a clear understanding that Russia was preparing to seize all the territory of Ukraine,"" Ukraine's State Bureau of Investigation director Oleksiy Sukhachev said in the statement. ""All this information will be studied."" Insider has not seen the documents and has not been able to independently verify the claims. Sukhachev said Ukrainian officials had inspected over 2,000 hectares of the destroyed town since its liberation. Aside from the documents, soldiers also found that more than 300 residential buildings had been permanently damaged, Sukhachev said. A number of unexploded shells and bombs had also been found, he added. The Russian military papers appear to confirm earlier assessments by Western officials that Putin had plans to swiftly take all of Ukraine, but failed to do so. Russian troops — who expected to seize Kyiv within days — retreated from the capital in early April and refocused their offensive in Ukraine's eastern region.

5/12/2022,"A former Korean YouTuber and pharmacist was sentenced to jail for knowingly spreading a sexually transmitted disease.

Park Seung-jong, who went by the name “Yakult,” was charged with injury and violation of the Pharmaceutical Affairs Act and sentenced to eight months in prison and two years of probation.

He was found guilty of knowingly spreading the herpes type 2 virus infection to various women.

“As the accused is a pharmacist, it is established that his actions were deliberate,” Judge Kim Min Joo of the Uijeongbu District Court, said. “As the accused had the Herpes 2 virus, and the victims showed early signs of the virus, it is impossible to deny the relation.”

The former YouTuber and pharmacist broadcaster rose to fame after appearing in entertainment programs, including MBC’s “My Little Television” in 2019.

Park was first accused in 2020 when a victim claimed that he disregarded her wish to use protection during sexual intercourse. She sued Park in June that year.

“Yakult ignored my wish to use a condom,” the victim reportedly said. “After having sex with him, I went to the hospital, as I was not feeling well and was diagnosed with herpes 2.”

The victim told her story online, and, since then, Park has disappeared from the public eye.

5/12/2022,"By Tim Kelly MIYAKO ISLAND (Reuters) - Seihan Nakazato wants the missile trucks on the base next to his melon farm to leave, but few others on Okinawa's Miyako island, he complains, are demanding that Japan's army remove such weapons, which he says would make them a target for China. ""We are a small community and there are lots of complicated relationships,"" said Nakazato, 68, standing next to one of the greenhouses he worries could be bombed. ""Some islanders do work for the base and others have relatives in the military."" As Nakazato harvests his melons on Japan's key border outpost, Okinawa on Sunday marks 50 years since the United States ended its occupation, raising hopes of a return to normality after its devastation in World War Two. But the East China Sea island chain, which, along with Taiwan, hems in Beijing's forces, fears it will become a battlefield again. ""We are worried about statements by national lawmakers that a Taiwan contingency would be a Japan contingency, and recent discussions that seem to assume Okinawa would be involved in an armed conflict,"" Okinawa's governor Denny Tamaki said at a news conference on May 6. The prefecture has about 1.4 million people, most of them on the eponymous main island. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has added to those concerns, with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida warning of the fragility of security in Asia. And Japanese lawmakers from Kishida's party have said they want strike missiles added to the country's arsenal - a weapon that could be deployed to Okinawa. China, which spends almost five times as much on defence as Japan, says it intentions in the region are peaceful. ""Okinawa will be the front line in the case of a war or conflict between Japan and China,"" said Masaaki Gabe, a professor emeritus at the University of Ryukyus on Okinawa's main island, who described himself as an insecure 17-year-old when the U.S. occupation ended. ""After 50 years, the insecure feeling still continues,"" he added. STRATEGIC VALUE Fringed with coral reefs and covered in sugar cane, Gabe's home island is a vital military outpost. It has two airports, a large port and is less than 400 kilometres (249 miles) from Taiwan. It is also 200km from uninhabited islands in the East China Sea that are the focal point of an intensifying territorial dispute with China. The Ground Self Defense Force (GSDF) camp next to Nakazato's farm, which used to be a golf course, is Japan's newest army base. The missiles deployed there, meant to target Chinese ships sailing in and out the Western Pacific, are the closest such weapons Japan has to China. ""I fear the whole island will become a fortress,"" said Hayako Shimizu, 73, the leader of a group of protesters opposed to the base, who stand outside every Thursday with flags planted on Nakazato's land. ""There aren't many people who speak up, although I think a lot of people are unhappy with it,"" Shimizu added. Base commander Colonel Masakazu Iyota, 52, thinks most islanders support or accept the presence of the 700 GSDF troops and their equipment, which he described as a ""frontline deterrence"". ""I don't think our current posture is enough,"" he said. NEXT STEPS Iyota may get reinforcements after Japan revises its national security strategy this year. As part of that review, ruling LDP lawmakers have said they want a commitment to more defence spending - including on missiles that can hit targets on foreign soil. Japan may hold off on deploying such strike weapons to Miyako to avoid provoking China, only 600km away, but Gabe predicts the country will station aircraft and other missiles in Okinawa. The next phase of military expansion on Miyako could be at its Shimoji airport, a former senior defence ministry official told Reuters, asking not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. Built to train jumbo jet pilots, it has been a symbol of resistance to militarization since Okinawa's first post-occupation governor, Chobyo Yara, secured a government promise to never deploy military planes there. Senior ruling Liberal Democratic party lawmakers such as Masahisa Sato have sought to annul that. ""Apart from the main Okinawa island, it is the only other place an F-15 fighter jet can operate from,"" said Sato, a former deputy defence minister, who proposed stationing air force jets there in 2020. ""As we have seen in Ukraine, you never know when war will break out."" ISLAND POLITICS Kishida's party will need local support in Okinawa to build more bases, a tough proposition when resentment over U.S. forces there dominates politics. Of 812 Okinawans polled by public broadcaster NHK in March, 56% said they strongly opposed U.S. bases; only a quarter of 1,115 people outside the prefecture said the same. A test of whether the LDP can gain ground comes in September, when Okinawa chooses its governor. Tamaki, an independent who wants a smaller military footprint, is on the ballot. On Miyako, Masahiro Hamamoto, 48, who served as an LDP city councilor for eight years, sees a chance for his party to gain support on his island, which depends on farming, tourism and public works spending. ""There is a sense that it benefits the island by having closer political links to central government,"" said the local beverage and cigarette wholesaler, who was born two years after Okinawa was returned to Japan. The income of Miyako's 55,000 residents is about 70% of the national average. ""The economy isn't good, so people will vote for the LDP,"" said Toshiaki Shimoji, 61, an Okinawa main island resident who traveled to Miyako to work his family's farm. ""Russia invaded Ukraine, so there will be more defence spending and that could mean more missiles here. I don't think base protests will change anything,"" he added, sitting on a tractor in a sugar cane field.

5/12/2022,"A Ukrainian counteroffensive north and east of Kharkiv has pushed Russian forces mostly out of shelling range of Ukraine's second-largest city, under near-constant attack since Moscow tried to surround it at the beginning of its invasion. Ukraine's armed forces now regularly report recapturing towns and villages from retreating Russian troops. A GIF showing the change in control North of Kharkiv over the last 2 weeks.

The fight has mostly involved the two sides ""lobbing artillery shells at one another, sometimes from dozens of miles away,"" New York Times correspondent Michael Schwirtz reports from the Kharkiv front lines. ""But at some points along the zigzagging eastern front, the combat becomes a vicious and intimate dance, granting enemy forces fleeting glimpses of one another as they jockey for command of hills and makeshift redoubts in towns and villages blasted apart by shells."" ""Ukrainian gains, modest for now, could have strategic implications for Russia's war in the Donbas to the southeast,"" the BBC's Sommerville reports. Ukrainian forces have pushed Russian lines within a handful of miles from Russia's borders in some places — Ukrainian shelling killed a Russian civilian in a village 6 miles into Russia, the governor of Belgorod region said — threatening to cut off the main ground supply routes for Russia's eastern offensive.

5/12/2022,"LONDON — Many observers expected Russia’s air force to blow away Ukraine’s forces in the opening days of the Kremlin’s invasion. Ukraine’s military would be left completely vulnerable as Russian warplanes could pick off targets at whim. But that hasn’t happened. More than two months later, Russia has still not established air supremacy over large swaths of Ukraine, despite having the world’s second-largest air force — and a highly advanced one at that. The New York Times reported Monday that, according to the U.S. Defense Department, Ukraine “continues to fly its own fighters and attack jets against Russian troops.” Russia’s air force has even been timid as Ukraine’s relatively scrappy anti-air defenses remain a formidable threat. NATO countries have done their best to flood Ukraine with man-portable air-defense systems, or MANPADS, like the U.S.-made Stinger missile. The Stinger system can be fired by a single operator, whose missile locks onto aircraft with infrared guidance. “The Western supplies of MANPAD and other types of air defense systems allowed Ukraine to increase and to improve its capabilities,” said Pavel Luzin, a Russian armed forces expert and contributor at the Jamestown Foundation. William Alberque, the director of strategy, technology and arms control at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told Yahoo News that Ukraine was able to effectively distribute these air defenses so it became too dangerous for Russian combat flights. NATO countries have also been providing Ukraine with increasingly advanced military hardware as Russia’s war drags on. Slovakia announced last month that it had donated its Soviet-era S-300 long-range air defense system to Ukraine. Russia has been further hampered by its combat aircrafts’ lackluster weapons systems. U.S. officials say Russian pilots are “unable to quickly locate and engage targets on the ground,” and missiles launched into Ukraine “often miss their targets — if they work at all,” according to the Times. Alberque said Russian stocks of precision-guided munitions are significantly smaller than NATO’s. This observation was backed by security analyst Oliver Alexander, who said on Twitter that with Russia’s lack of precision-guided munitions, “they are forced to use dumb munitions [unguided bombs] to operate at scale.” But technology alone does not fully explain Russia’s failure to establish air superiority. Experts say Russia’s air doctrine has been poorly thought out and haphazardly executed from the opening days of the war. “They thought it would be all over very quickly, with a complete Ukrainian collapse at first contact and [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky either captured or fleeing,” Alberque said. If the Kremlin had predicted Ukrainian resilience, the Russian military would have “done a lot differently and their air power would be far more devastating now,” he said. And because Moscow believed it would capture Ukraine the first few days, Russian military command was keen not to destroy Ukrainian infrastructure it wanted to keep for controlling the country after the war, Alberque said. Phillips Payson O’Brien, a professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, and Edward Stringer, a retired Royal Air Force air marshal, published a Monday essay in the Atlantic delving into the Russian air force’s failures. They argued1 that the Russian military struggles to creatively use air doctrine because it is philosophically wedded to being a traditional land power with massive reserves of soldiers at its disposal. “When the invasion started, the Russian air force was incapable of running a well-thought-out, complex campaign,” they wrote. “Instead of working to control the skies, Russia’s air force has mostly provided air support to ground troops or bombed Ukrainian cities. In this it has followed the traditional tactics of a continental power that privileges land forces.”",World/Yahoo News,Why Russia's air force failed to dominate Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/why-russias-air-force-failed-to-dominate-ukraine-135016604.html
5/12/2022,"A Richmond Hill man is facing charges after RCMP identified and seized 10,000 counterfeit toonies. The charges stem from an investigation dating back to last summer, when the Royal Canadian Mint discovered an ongoing counterfeit currency problem through their random sampling process. From there, the Greater Toronto Area's Trans-National Serious and Organized Crime Section opened an investigation that focused on finding those who were involved in the circulation of the faulty coins. During this time, Mounties seized about 10,000 fake two-dollar coins, which had been distributed in the banking system and had one specific detail flaw that distinguished them from real coins. The main way to identify these counterfeit coins is the split-toe on the right front paw of the Polar Bear side of the coin, which instead resembles a claw. Daixiong He, 68, is charged with uttering counterfeit money and possession of counterfeit money. He was arrested and released on an undertaking but is set to appear in a Newmarket court on June 2. ""The unique features on Canada's circulation coins make them among the most secure in the world and allowed these counterfeit pieces to be identified and removed from circulation quickly,” James Malizia, Vice-President of Corporate Security at the Royal Canadian Mint said in a release. “The Royal Canadian Mint will continue to work closely with financial institutions and the RCMP to ensure the integrity of Canada's coin supply."" The Bank of Canada has some pointers on what to do if you’re dealing with suspicious money. During a transaction, if you suspect you've been handed suspicious currency, politely refuse it and explain that you suspect it may be counterfeit. Then, ask for another note (be sure to check it too). Advise the person to check the note with local police. Inform your local police of a possible attempt to pass suspected counterfeit money. Be polite. The person in possession of the bill could be an innocent victim who does not realize that the note is suspicious. If you think you’ve been handed a counterfeit note after a transaction, give it to local police. If it’s real, you’ll get it back. It’s important to report these instances to authorities to help them bring counterfeiters to justice.",News/Yahoo News Canada,Don't be fooled by fake toonies: RCMP seizes thousands of fakes with a botched polar bear 'claw',https://news.yahoo.com/fake-toonies-rcmp-counterfeit-171211935.html
