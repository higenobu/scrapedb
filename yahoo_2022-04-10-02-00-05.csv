4/10/2022,"Slovakia said it sent Ukraine an S-300 air defense system to defend against Russian attacks. The Soviet-era S-300 is a long-range surface-to-air missile system that can shoot down cruise missiles and aircraft. The small Eastern European country is the first NATO member to send Ukraine such advanced weaponry. Slovakia Prime Minister Eduard Heger has confirmed that it had sent its S-300 air defense system to Ukraine, becoming the first NATO country to answer the calls by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to supply powerful missile weaponry. The S-300 is a Soviet-era long-range surface-to-air missile system that can shoot down cruise missiles and aircraft and has a range of up to 90 miles. It is considered one of the most potent anti-aircraft missile systems and is in the arsenal of three NATO countries: Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Greece. —Eduard Heger (@eduardheger) April 8, 2022 On Friday, the Slovakian prime minister wrote on Facebook that donating the system did not mean that Slovakia, a NATO country, has become a part of the armed conflict in Ukraine. Zelenskyy has urged Western allies to send planes, tanks, and defense systems to Ukraine and mentioned S-300s during an impassioned speech to Congress by video last month. ""Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people,"" Zelenskyy told Congress. ""You know what kind of defense systems we need, S-300 and other similar systems."" NATO countries have begun to step up their support of Ukraine by sending more heavy-duty weaponry as Russia's invasion continues. The Czech Republic became the first NATO country to send tanks to Ukraine earlier this week, as a Czech defense source told Reuters. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told AP on Thursday that individual NATO countries were planning to increase the supply of weapons to Ukraine following recent atrocities but did not provide details. As an organization, NATO has refused to send weapons or troops to non-member Ukraine, but individual countries can choose to act. The move follows recent reports about the death of at least 300 civilians in Bucha and a rocket attack on a train station in Kramatorsk that killed at least 50 people on Friday. Zelenskyy warned that the predicted fighting in Donbas, eastern Ukraine, could result in the biggest war in centuries. Speaking to the German newspaper BILD, owned by Axel Springer, Insider's parent company, on Friday, Zelenskyy predicted intense fighting in the coming days. ""It could be a big war in Donbas — like the world has not seen in hundreds of years,"" he told BILD reporter Paul Ronzheimer. ""We will go on defending our country until the end,"" the Ukrainian president continued. The chilling forecast echoes what Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba told NATO members on Thursday. ""The battle for Donbas will remind you of the Second World War,"" Kuleba said. He used this warning to immediately call on Western allies to provide more heavy weaponry, including air defense systems, artillery, armored vehicles, and jets. Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces are regrouping for a new eastern offensive on the Donbas region after failing to capture Kyiv. President Joe Biden said on Friday that the US was supporting Slovakia's decision to ship the S-300 missile system to Ukraine and was sending the Eastern European country a US-made Patriot missile-defense system as a replacement. ""I want to thank the Slovakian government for providing an S-300 air defense system to Ukraine, something President Zelenskyy has personally raised with me in our conversations,"" Biden said. ""Now is no time for complacency,"" Biden said in a statement while accusing the Russian military of committing ""horrific acts of brutality.""

4/10/2022,"By David Lawder WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States is ramping up sanctions against Russia to deprive Moscow's ""war machine"" of money and components needed to sustain its invasion of Ukraine, but curbing a main source of funding, Russian energy exports, will take time, U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo told Reuters on Thursday. The United States and its allies have ""a lot more that we can and we will do"" to punish Moscow if Russia fails to halt its invasion, Adeyemo told Reuters in an interview. Ukrainian leaders called on Thursday for the democratic world to stop buying Russian oil and gas, and cut Russian banks entirely from the international financial system. After an initial drive to freeze Russian assets, Washington and its allies announced incremental steps this week as they approach the limit of sanctions to punish Russia without also causing economic pain at home. A new investment ban announced on Wednesday by President Joe Biden forbids Americans from investing in Russian firms' equity and debt and investment funds, cutting off Russia's defense industry and other sectors from the world's biggest source of investment capital, Adeyemo said. ""What this means is that Russia will be deprived of the capital it needs to build up its economy, but also to invest in its war machine,"" Adeyemo said. Asked whether it would prohibit companies already in Russia from further funding those operations, he said Treasury was consulting with the private sector. Kremlin officials, who have described their actions in Ukraine as a ""special military operation"" have insisted that Western sanctions will not have any effect on their goals and will solidify Russian support Adeyemo said the United States and its European allies will target Russian military supply chains to deny access to key components - ""things that are important to building their tanks, to supplying missiles and making sure that they have fewer resources"" to fight the war in Ukraine but also to project power in the future. ""I think the impact will be immediate in the same way the impact on the economy has been immediate"" from prior sanctions, Adeyemo said. Russia's economy is headed for a 10% contraction this year and inflation is approaching 20%, U.S. officials estimate. The Treasury later on Thursday put Russian diamond miner Alrosa on its sanctions blacklist https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0707, while the U.S. State Department did the same for United Shipbuilding Corp, a state firm building naval ships and submarines and its subsidiaries and board members. White House Economic Council director Brian Deese said on Wednesday that the Biden administration also would ban transactions with United Aircraft Corp, the maker of Sukhoi and MiG fighter jets -- planes that are also flown by U.S. allies including some NATO members. Adeyemo said Russia's defense sector since 2014 has set up front companies to acquire critical supplies and materials to build up Moscow's military. A number of these firms were targeted by sanctions https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0677 last month. ROUBLE SUPPORT DRAINS WAR FUNDS Financial sanctions have forced Russia to spend more of its hard-currency energy revenues to defend its rouble currency, Adeyemo said, eating into funds available for the war effort. After losing 45% of its value against the dollar in the first two weeks of the Ukraine invasion, the Russian rouble has risen to just below its pre-war level, thanks to capital controls by Moscow and distortion by the Russian central bank, U.S. officials say. ""What that means is that Russia has less money and the president is forced to make choices between propping up the economy and investing in the war in Ukraine,"" he said. Adeyemo said his meetings last week with European allies in London, Brussels, Paris and Berlin helped focused on next steps and helped to accelerate the sanctions announced on Wednesday. Adeyemo said he was encouraged by ""strong statements"" from European countries about reducing their dependence on Russian energy but said the continent was in a different position from the United States, the world's top oil producer. ""Because of our ability to produce energy at home, we were able to ban the Russian import of oil to America rather quickly,"" he said. ""It's going to take them more time but what they're doing is they're reducing their dependence over time.""

4/10/2022,"BEIJING (AP) — A series of deaths at a hospital for elderly patients in Shanghai is underscoring the dangerous consequences of China's stubborn pursuit of a zero-COVID approach amid an escalating outbreak in the city of 26 million people. Multiple patients have died at the Shanghai Donghai Elderly Care hospital, relatives of patients told The Associated Press. They say their loved ones weren’t properly cared for after caretakers who came into contact with the virus were taken away to be quarantined, in adherence to the strict pandemic regulations, depleting the hospital of staff. Family members have taken to social media to plea for help and answers and are demanding to see surveillance video from inside the facility after getting little to no information from the hospital. The conditions and deaths at the hospital are a sharp rebuke of China's strategy of sticking to a zero-COVID policy as it deals with the outbreak in Shanghai in which most of the infected people don't have symptoms. With a focus on forcing positive cases and close contacts into designated collective quarantine facilities, the costs of zero-COVID may be outweighing the risk of getting sick. On Saturday, Shanghai Vice Mayor Zong Ming said the lockdown could soon be lifted or eased in communities that report no positive cases within 14 days, after another round of citywide COVID-19 testing. Shen Peiming, 71, was one such casualty of harsh measures. She died Sunday morning at the hospital, without any relatives by her side. A family member said they have been calling the hospital non-stop to find out the circumstances of Shen's death, but have not gotten a clear answer. “How many times have there been lockdowns since 2020? They still don't have experience managing this?"" the family member said. All they know is her doctor and nurses had not been there to care for Shen, who was partially paralyzed after a stroke. Her last nursing assistant had been quarantined for being a close contact of a positive case, the relative said, speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution. An unfamiliar worker called to inform them of her death. Later, the hospital said it was due to a chest infection. The hospital had a COVID-19 outbreak, the family heard from orderlies, but Shen had tested negative as of last week. Shanghai authorities have reported no deaths from this outbreak, but questions have been raised about the reliability of the data. A city health official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic, said that the criteria for confirming cases and deaths are very strict and susceptible to political meddling. It is unclear how many patients have died at the hospital, and whether any died of COVID-19. Families say they are talking with other families whose relatives have also died. An article from Chinese news outlet Caixin describing the deaths and infections was taken down shortly after it was published, apparently targeted by censors. Calls to the main office of Donghai Elderly Care went unanswered. The Shanghai government did not respond to a faxed request for comment. Most experts agree that China’s zero-COVID approach was highly successful in keeping deaths to a minimum when there were limited drugs or vaccines. But now that shots are widely available in China, and with the advent of the omicron variant, many say the government should abandon the policy and focus medical resources on the elderly and vulnerable instead. Instead, Shanghai has locked down its 26 million people and carried out repeated mass testing to tackle an outbreak driven by the highly contagious omicron BA.2 variant. On Saturday, the city reported more than 23,000 new local cases, of which only 1,015 had symptoms. “If you’re asymptomatic, what’s going to hurt you?” said Ray Yip, the founding director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control office in China, who maintains close ties with Chinese health officials. “The only people who get sick are those with diabetes, obesity, chronic disease, old people. Protect those people. You can protect them.” A low vaccination rate among the elderly, though, remains a concern. Only 62% of Shanghai residents over 60 have been vaccinated, according to the latest data available. Some experts support the strict approach, saying China needs to raise that rate before it can safely live with the virus. The U.S. guidelines for asymptomatic cases, as in the U.K., are that individuals isolate at home for five days. In Shanghai, workers are rushing to set up massive temporary facilities in exhibition halls and elsewhere to try to house everyone who tests positive. The citywide lockdown has disrupted daily life and the economy. Many residents, trapped in their apartment buildings, are  scrambling to buy food  through apps and place bulk orders with neighbors. Some in quarantine have posted videos showing chaotic scenes of people rushing to get food and a lack of clean toilets. Others have posted pleas for relatives who need medicine urgently. The U.S. said Friday that it is allowing the voluntary departure of non-essential personnel and family members from its consulate in Shanghai because of the situation. The government has trumpeted its success in curbing COVID-19, touting it as evidence of the superiority of China’s governing system — especially compared to Western democracies, where deaths have far exceeded China's. That narrative, experts said, is making it difficult for Beijing to switch tactics. “They bragged too hard to their own people about how wonderful they are, and now they’ve painted themselves into a corner,” said Yip. “The only way they can control Shanghai now is to repeat what they did in Wuhan.” The 11 million residents of Wuhan were locked down for more than two months at the start of the pandemic in 2020. Shanghai's lockdown is an abrupt about-face from just a month ago, when some Chinese health experts publicly suggested softening pandemic control measures. The city’s economic importance and advanced health care system left officials reluctant to impose strict measures and confident about combating any outbreaks. Further, Chinese leader Xi Jinping ordered that ongoing outbreaks in China be controlled at “minimum cost” in mid-March, emphasizing Beijing’s desire to protect the economy while curbing the virus. Shanghai took targeted steps, locking down individual office buildings, shopping centers and neighborhoods for 48 hours at a time but otherwise allowing life to go on as usual. With the soft measures, the city's case count rose. The outbreak spilled over to at least 71 other cities, according to a notice posted by Guangxi province in southern China, and pressure grew for harsher measures. On March 28, the city started an eight-day lockdown in two phases, which has since evolved into a citywide one with no end in sight. “There is no time to waste,” Chinese Vice Premier Sun Chunlan said on a visit to the city last weekend, according to a government statement. “We need to move forward faster and harder to provide strong support for the elimination of cases in society.” The actions sent nurses and doctors into quarantine, causing conditions to worsen at Donghai Elderly Care. Chen Jielei said the outbreak at the hospital infected her unvaccinated, partially paralyzed 81-year-old mother. Because staff members also fell ill, her mother wasn’t served meals on time and her sheets were unchanged for days. After a few days, a replacement worker started taking care of her. A college professor who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was afraid of retribution, said his family wasn't notified for more than a day after his 82-year-old father died on March 31. His last contact was on March 28 with a nursing assistant who called to warn there were positive cases and they could no longer take care of his father. “In those three days, what happened to my father? What kind of mistreatment did he suffer?” he asked. His father’s condition had been stable on March 28 when he spoke with the nursing assistant. Shen had lived on and off in the hospital for three years after her stroke. Family members visited every week. But visits were banned in early March as the COVID-19 outbreak spread through Shanghai, the relative said. They were not worried initially because the hospital had always been very responsive and they were in contact with the nursing assistants who took care of Shen. But one orderly warned on March 26 there were positive cases and many of Donghai’s staff were being quarantined. The hospital hired temporary nursing assistants, but many did not have healthcare experience, one nursing assistant said. The woman, who gave only her last name of Zhang, said an employment agency told her it was a cleaning job. “They said your work is just to clean, you won’t even have to wear a protective suit. But what they said was completely different from what I had to do,” she said. Shen needed to be assisted with eating through a tube by having her food blended into a liquid. She also had a tube in her throat that had to be disinfected each day. “In the past, if there was an issue, they’d always call me. This time, there wasn’t even a voice message, and she died so suddenly,” the relative said. Now the hospital is asking the families to sign a form to cremate the deceased. Shen's relative said the family will refuse until they get a clear answer. The hospital sent an apology letter Wednesday to some of the families. The AP has viewed a copy. “Because of the outbreak's emergency, and many of the seniors had not been vaccinated, this caused those with severe underlying illness and weak health to die,” it said. While Chinese government researchers have begun exploring ways to end zero COVID, the government continues to punish officials with large outbreaks on their turfs. “The space for discussion is now eliminated,” said Yanzhong Huang, a public health expert at the Council for Foreign Relations in the U.S. “The message is loud and clear: zero-COVID, no exceptions.” ___ Wu reported from Taipei, Taiwan.

4/10/2022,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — A suspect arrested in connection with last weekend's mass shooting outside bars near the California state Capitol served less than half his 10-year sentence because of voter-approved changes to state law that lessened the punishment for his felony convictions and provided a chance for earlier release. Smiley Allen Martin was freed in February after serving time for punching a girlfriend, dragging her from her home by her hair and whipping her with a belt, according to court and prison records. Those count as nonviolent offenses under California law, which considers only about two dozen crimes to be violent felonies — things like murder, rape, arson and kidnapping. Martin, 27, was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person and possession of a machine gun. He is among the 12 people wounded during Sunday's shooting, which killed six others. Police say the violence was a shootout between rival gangs in which at least five people fired weapons, including Martin's brother, Dandrae Martin, who also was arrested. Smiley Martin typically would have remained behind bars until at least May after serving a minimum of half his time for his previous arrest in 2017, but prison officials evidently used a very expansive approach to applying time credits to his sentence, said Gregory Totten, chief executive officer of the California District Attorneys Association and a former Ventura County district attorney. “They’ve been given very broad authority to early release folks and to give them additional credit and all kinds of considerations for purposes of reducing the length of sentence that somebody serves,” Totten said. Corrections officials did not dispute that Martin was among thousands of inmates receiving additional credits that sped up his release under state law. But they said their policy prohibits disclosing what credits Martin received. They cited credits through Proposition 57, the 2016 ballot measure that aimed to give most felons a chance at earlier release. Credits were also broadly authorized to lower the prison population during the pandemic. Proposition 57 credits include good behavior, though corrections officials would not release Martin's disciplinary report. Good conduct credit is supposed to be reserved for inmates who follow all the rules and complete their assigned duties. The state “has implemented various credit-earning opportunities to incentivize good behavior and program participation for incarcerated individuals, including those created in furtherance of Proposition 57— which was overwhelmingly approved by voters,” corrections spokesperson Vicky Waters said in a statement. Proponents, including former Gov. Jerry Brown, who pushed for Proposition 57, say it's important to give inmates a second chance. The opportunity for earlier release encourages inmates to participate in education and other rehabilitative programs, while helping to reduce mass incarceration. “The most recent reforms in California are seeking to change a culture that has been churning out recidivism problems for generations,” said Will Matthews, spokesperson for Californians for Safety and Justice, which backed the changes. “The question we need to be asking ourselves is, how are we engaging in behavior change?” Under Proposition 57, there are credits for completing rehabilitative or educational programs, self-help and volunteer public service activities, earning a high school diploma or higher education degree and performing a heroic act. Officials added credits during the coronavirus pandemic, including 12 weeks of credit that applied to most inmates. Martin was denied parole in May 2021 under California's process for nonviolent offenders to get earlier parole, after a letter from the Sacramento County District Attorney's Office. Prosecutors objected based on his lengthy criminal record and asserted Martin “clearly has little regard for human life and the law.” Six months after he turned 18, Martin was caught in January 2013 with an assault rifle and two fully loaded 25-bullet magazines, prosecutors said. Months later, he pushed aside a Walmart clerk to steal computers worth $2,800, they said. In 2016, he was arrested as a parolee at large. And less than six months after that was the assault that sent him back to prison. It's not clear if Martin has an attorney who can comment on his behalf. Martin pleaded no contest and was sent to prison on charges of corporal injury and assault likely to cause great bodily injury in January 2018 under a plea deal in which charges of kidnapping — considered a violent felony — and intimidating a witness or victim were dismissed. The sentencing judge awarded Martin 508 days of credits for time he spent in Sacramento County jail before his conviction, based on a California law that allows judges to double the actual time in jail, which in Martin's case was 254 days. Martin also had “a variety of additional post-sentencing credits,” which corrections department spokesperson Dana Simas said were awarded for time served while awaiting transfer to state prison from county jail. Before Proposition 57, he would have qualified for 20% “good time” credits — meaning he could reduce his time served by one-fifth — but corrections officials used their authority under the ballot measure to bump those to 50%. Pending regulations opposed by most of the state's district attorneys would further increase good time credits to two-thirds of a sentence for such repeat offenders. Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg, a progressive Democrat who formerly led the state Senate, was among those upset when he learned of Martin's record. “If people have a history of committing violent acts, and they have not shown a propensity or willingness to change, I don’t think they should be out on the streets,” he said at an event where officials requested more than $3 billion from the state to expand crime prevention programs. Republican state Sen. Jim Nielsen, who once headed the state parole board, said “good time” credits are generally awarded automatically, without inmates having to do anything to earn them. “It gives them enormous opportunity to free up beds,” said Nielsen, an opponent of earlier releases. The state has relied on such efforts, particularly its powers under Proposition 57, to keep the prison population below the level required by a panel of federal judges who ruled that inmate crowding had led to unconstitutionally poor conditions. Martin was released to the supervision of the Sacramento County Probation Department in February. County probation officials wouldn't provide the terms, saying their records are not public documents. Without discussing Martin's case, Karen Pank, executive director of the Chief Probation Officers of California, said generally someone coming out of prison on Post Release Community Supervision with an extensive and violent criminal history would likely have been treated on a “high-risk” caseload. That would subject him to more intensive supervision, including a requirement that he check in with his probation officer more frequently and in person, although individualized determinations on risks and needs would be made and treatment and services would continue to be offered. Hours before Sunday’s shootout, Martin posted a live Facebook video of himself brandishing a handgun, a law enforcement officials told The Associated Press. The official was not authorized to public discuss details of the shooting investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity. Pank said if there is evidence of a felon in possession of a firearm, that can be grounds for a violation, which may result in time in jail. However, it's unlikely anyone from law enforcement could have acted in time even if they had seen the video. “The big if is would they have known about it,” said Totten. But in this case, ""it didn't matter — it was so close to the time” of the shooting. ___ Associated Press writers Adam Beam, Stefanie Dazio and Michael Balsamo contributed to this story.
