2/25/2022,"Romelu Lukaku is not thinking about leaving Chelsea this summer and is focused on winning back his place for Sunday’s Carabao Cup final against Liverpool. The striker has struggled since his £97.5m move from Internazionale and there is fresh doubt over his place in Thomas Tuchel’s plans after he was dropped against Lille in the Champions League on Tuesday. Chelsea’s attack was more mobile with Kai Havertz leading the line during the 2-0 victory and Lukaku, an unused substitute, could find himself on the bench again.  That has led to suggestions in Italy that Lukaku is planning to press for a return there at the end of the season. The Belgian has not looked settled in Tuchel’s system and was dropped and fined after giving an unsanctioned interview to Sky Italia in December. However Tuchel’s team selection against Lille has not caused Lukaku to make any decisions over his future. The 28-year-old remains determined to make a success of his second spell at Chelsea, who are tracking Barcelona’s Ousmane Dembélé, and hopes to convince Tuchel to start him at Wembley. It remains to be seen whether Lukaku can do enough in training to regain his place. He had only seven touches when Chelsea beat Crystal Palace last weekend and has scored only 10 goals this season. Tuchel said he wanted to protect Lukaku after his performance against Palace. The manager explained his decision to drop him by saying that the player was mentally and physically tired. However it is understood Lukaku did not feel tired and considered himself ready to start against Lille. Tuchel picked Havertz, who will be confident of keeping his place after scoring the opener against Lille. The 22-year-old gave Chelsea more fluidity in attack and there was also a fine performance from Christian Pulisic. The American winger scored Chelsea’s second goal and will be hopeful of starting again against Liverpool. There is no shortage of choices for Tuchel, who brought on Timo Werner against Lille. Hakim Ziyech is a doubt with an ankle injury but Mason Mount has returned from ankle ligament damage and Callum Hudson-Odoi is close to recovering from an achilles problem. Chelsea, who have concerns over Mateo Kovacic’s fitness after the midfielder limped off against Lille, are monitoring developments regarding Dembélé. The France forward played for Tuchel at Borussia Dortmund and is poised to leave Barcelona on a free at the end of the season. Dembélé has struggled with form and injuries since joining Barcelona in 2017 and there is nothing advanced with Chelsea, who face competition for the 24-year-old from Paris Saint-Germain. Barcelona remain confident of signing César Azpilicueta this summer. However they could be forced to pay a small fee because Chelsea have an option to extend thedefenders’s deal, which is due to expire at the end of the season. Chelsea did something similar with Olivier Giroud last summer, triggering a one-year extension in the French striker’s contract before selling him to Milan for £1.7m a month later.",Sport/Football,Romelu Lukaku has no plans to leave Chelsea and will fight to win back place,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/24/romelu-lukaku-chelsea-no-plans-to-leave-fight-to-win-back-place
2/25/2022,"We must do what we can to contain Vladimir Putin’s aggression in Ukraine. But we also need to be clear-eyed about it, and face the costs. Economics can’t be separated from politics, and neither can be separated from history. Here are eight sobering realities: 1. Will the economic sanctions now being put into effect stop Putin from seeking to take over all of Ukraine? No. They will complicate Russia’s global financial transactions but they will not cripple the Russian economy. After Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula in 2014, the US and its allies imposed economic sanctions which slowed the Russian economy temporarily, but Russia soon rebounded. Since then, Russia has taken steps to lessen its reliance on foreign debt and investment, which means that similar sanctions will have less effect. In addition, the rise of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets allow Russia to bypass bank transfers, which are the control points for sanctions. Bottom line: the sanctions already imposed or threatened could reduce Russia’s gross domestic product, but only by a few percentage points.  2. What sort of sanctions would seriously damage Russia? Sanctions on Russia’s enormous oil and gas exports could cause substantial harm. Russia produces 10 million barrels of oil a day, which is about 10 percent of global demand. It ranks third in world oil production (behind the United States and Saudi Arabia). It ranks second in natural gas (behind the US), according to the US Energy Information Administration. 3. Then why not impose sanctions on them? Because that would seriously harm consumers in Europe and the US – pushing up energy prices and worsening inflation (now running at 7.5% annually in the US, a 40-year high). Although the US imports very little Russian oil or natural gas, oil and natural gas markets are global – which means shortages that push up prices in one part of the world will have similar effects elsewhere. The price of oil in the US is already approaching $100 a barrel, up from about $65 a year ago. The price of gas at the pump is averaging $3.53 a gallon, according to AAA. For most Americans, that gas-pump price is the single most important indicator of inflation, not just because they fuel their cars with gas but because the cost is emblazoned in big numbers outside every gas station in America. (The biggest beneficiaries of these price increases, by the way: energy companies like Halliburton, Occidental Petroleum and Schlumberger, which are now leading the S&P 500. Anyone in favor of putting a windfall profits tax on them?) 4. Will stronger sanctions weaken Putin’s control over Russia? Possibly. But they could also have the opposite effect – enabling Putin to fuel Russia’s suspicions toward the west and stir up even more Russian nationalism. The harshest US measures would cause the average Russian to pay higher prices for food and clothing or devalue pensions and savings accounts because of a crash in the ruble or Russian markets, but these might be seen as necessary sacrifices that rally Russians around Putin. 5. Any other foreign policy consequences we should be watching? In a word: China. Russia’s concern about the west has already led to a rapprochement with China. A strong alliance between the two most powerful world autocracies could be worrisome. 6. What about domestic politics here in the US? Foreign policy crises tend to drive domestic policy off the headlines, and weaken reform movements. Putin’s aggression in Ukraine has already quieted conversations in America about voting rights, filibuster reform, and Build Back Better – at least for now. Large-scale war, if it ever comes to that, deadens reform. The first world war brought the progressive era to a halt. The second ended FDR’s New Deal. Vietnam stopped Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society. Wars and the threat of wars also legitimate huge military expenditures and giant military bureaucracies. America is already spending $776bn a year on the military, a sum greater than the next 10 giant military powers (including Russia and China) together. Wars also create fat profits for big corporations in war industries. The possibility of war also distracts the public from failures of domestic politics, as the Spanish-American war did for President William McKinley and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq did for George W Bush. (Hopefully, Biden’s advisers aren’t thinking this way.) 7. Could the sanctions lead to real war between Russia and the west? Unlikely. Americans don’t want Americans to die in order to protect Ukraine (most Americans don’t even know where Ukraine is, let alone our national interest in protecting it). And neither Russia nor the US wants to be annihilated in a nuclear holocaust. But international crises such as this one always run the risk of getting out of hand. Russia and the US have giant stockpiles of nuclear weapons. What if one is set off accidentally? More likely: what if Russia cyber-attacks the US, causing massive damage to US utilities, communications, banks, hospitals, and transportation networks here? What if Russian troops threaten Nato members along Ukraine’s borders? Under these conditions, might the US be willing to commit ground troops? Those who have fought ground and air wars know war is hell. Subsequent generations tend to forget. By the eve of the first world war, many in America and Britain spoke of the glories of large-scale warfare because so few remembered actual warfare. Today, most Americans have no direct experience of war. Afghanistan and Iraq were abstractions for most of us. Vietnam has faded from our collective memory. 8. What is Putin really after? Not just keeping Ukraine out of Nato, because Nato itself isn’t Putin’s biggest worry. After all, Hungary and Poland are Nato members but are governed in ways that resemble Russia more than western democracies. Putin’s real fear is liberal democracy, which poses a direct threat to authoritarian “strongmen” like him (just as it did to Donald Trump). Putin wants to keep liberal democracy far away from Russia. Putin’s means of keeping western liberal democracy at bay isn’t just to invade Ukraine, of course. It’s also to stoke division inside the west by fueling racist nationalism in western Europe and the United States. In this, Trump and Trumpism continue to be Putin’s most important ally.

2/25/2022,"The loss of a loved one can have a profound impact on humans, affecting everything from sleep patterns to appetite. Now researchers say they have found similar behaviour changes in dogs who have lost a canine companion. While the team say it is not clear if the findings can be described as grief, they say the work potentially indicates an overlooked welfare issue.  Dr Federica Pirrone of the University of Milan, who is one of the study’s authors, said: “Dogs are highly emotional animals who develop very close bonds with the members of the familiar group. This means that they may be highly distressed if one of them dies and efforts should be made to help them cope with this distress.” Expressions of grief are not unique to humans: great apes, dolphins, elephants and birds are among species that have been observed to take part in rituals around death and appear to mourn. Writing in the journal Scientific Reports, Pirrone and colleagues describe how they analysed the responses of 426 Italian adults who completed a “mourning dog questionnaire” online to investigate how canines experience grief. All of the participants had experienced the loss of one of their dogs while at least one other dog was still alive, and the questionnaire looked at the behaviour and emotions of the owner and their surviving dogs after the death. The results reveal that 86% of owners said their surviving dogs had shown behavioural changes after the death of another canine in the household. Pirrone said: “Overall, dogs were reported to play and eat less, sleep more and seek more for owners’ attention.” She said the results did not appear to be affected by the level of attachment between the owner and their dog or whether they humanised their pets, suggesting the owners were not simply projecting their grief. The team said the changes did not turn out to be linked to how long the dogs had lived together or whether the surviving dogs had seen the corpse. The researchers said there were a number of possible explanations for the findings, including that the death may have disrupted shared behaviours for the surviving dogs. “In support of this hypothesis we found that if dogs used to share food during life, the surviving dog was more likely to reduce her/his level of activities and sleep more after the loss,” the authors wrote. The results also revealed behavioural changes were stronger for dogs that were reported to have had a friendly relationship with the animal that had died, or who had been their parent or offspring. “Most likely this means that the surviving dog has lost an attachment figure, who provided safety and security,” said Pirrone. Human emotions may also play a role: increases in the surviving dogs’ levels of fear and a reduction in food consumption were associated with greater suffering, anger and psychological trauma in the owners in response to the death. “This means that there might have been some form of emotional contagion or of social transmission of fear, that is common in social species as part of an adaptive coping strategy with potentially dangerous circumstances,” said Pirrone. The team said, however, the finding could also be linked to owners’ perceptions of the surviving dogs’ behaviour or emotions. Pirrone said the definition of “grief” in dogs, as for young children, was not straightforward. “Dogs do form emotional bonds, and hence the loss of a companion animal in their household can be expected to cause behavioural changes, like those we recorded in our study, which overlap what we normally interpret as being grief and mourning,” she said. “Of course, based on our results we still cannot tell whether these dogs were responding only to the ‘loss’of an affiliate, or to their ‘death’ per se.” Prof Samantha Hurn, a social anthropologist at the University of Exeter, said it was important to understand what a dog may experience upon the death of a canine companion, but added the study had limitations, including that owners were not always good at reading dog behaviour, while the use of questionnaires involving scales for such a subjective issue may limit the conclusions that can be drawn. She said: “In the course of my own research I have experienced many dogs and other animals behaving in very different ways, but ways which nonetheless suggested to me that they were emotionally impacted by the death of a close companion.”",News/Science,Dogs experience a form of mourning when another dog in the household dies ,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/24/dogs-mourning-when-dog-in-household-dies
2/25/2022,"When they opened nearly 250 years ago the town’s church bells rang out, the local militia fired their field guns in salute and around 30,000 awestruck spectators turned up to cheer. Today the Grade I-listed Bingley Five Rise Locks in West Yorkshire are still considered one of the true wonders of Britain’s waterways and can, thanks to a major restoration project, carry on lifting boats up and down the Leeds to Liverpool canal for years to come.  Workers have spent the last month replacing the giant gates at two of the five locks. At 7 metres’ tall and weighing six tonnes, they are among the tallest lock gates in the UK. They form part of the steepest flight of locks in Britain. There is a magic about them, said the former lock keeper Richard Moore, part of the team restoring the site. “When you’re at the top looking down it does look huge, it looks scary,” Moore said. “But it’s only a 60ft rise really. It is just so impressive in terms of the engineering and the scale. It is a beautiful thing. When you see people’s reactions going in … it’s like a fair ride.” For many it is daunting but lots of help is always on hand. No narrow boat can go through the locks without a lock keeper, and even though they have taken down the “you must obey the lock keeper at all times” sign, people are still expected to follow instructions. It can take 30 minutes to get a boat down the locks and 45 minutes to get up. At busy times there are queues, the result being sometimes that if a boat arrives in the afternoon it might not get through until the next day. The new lock gates have been hand-crafted using traditional methods at the Canal and River Trust’s specialist workshops at Stanley Ferry in Yorkshire. The locks are considered one of the greatest feats of canal engineering of their day and are Grade I-listed, the same as York Minster – only 2.5% of listed buildings are Grade I. They sit on a waterway that was once one of England’s most important transport links. In the 18th century when the canal arrived in your town or village it was something to celebrate said William Froggatt, a heritage adviser to the trust. “What tended to happen was the price of coal went down significantly and in those days coal was the thing – you cooked your food, you heated your house … industry was increasingly using coal. A boat could carry 40 tonnes of coal as opposed to a horse and cart which could perhaps carry one tonne. “The canal was a cause for celebration anyway but a structure like this would have been out of anybody’s experience.” They were – and remain – quite something to see close up. When they opened in March 1774 a report in the Leeds Intelligencer said the locks were among “the noblest works of the kind that perhaps are to be found, in the same extent in the universe”. The lock repairs are part of the charity’s wider £55m winter restoration programme across the 2,000-mile network of historic canals and rivers. “I think these things are worth preserving and maintaining not just because they exist, but because people built them whose names in the main we’ve forgotten,” said Froggatt. “I think it is worth it in their memory as much as anything else. We are respecting their work and I hope people will respect our work in 100 years time.”",News/UK news,"‘At the top, it looks scary’: Bingley celebrates Five Rise Locks restoration",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/24/bingley-five-rise-locks-restoration-yorkshire-canal
2/25/2022,"The Fiver, wise beyond its beers, realised a long time ago that nothing good could come from us reaching for unattainably high standards, which is to say high standards. Pep Guardiola is not like that, and that’s his problem. The Catalan comes across as one of those perfectionists to whom the slightest flaw in his work triggers agonising reflections, leaving him Edvard Munching into the bathroom mirror, screaming like a pained circus oddity. So just imagine how Guardiola suffers from reminders that Manchester City’s bogey team are Tottenham Honking Hotspur, for goodness sake.  On Wednesday Guardiola had to watch Liverpool demolish both Leeds United and the small goal difference advantage that City had enjoyed over their closest rivals as Jürgen Klopp’s team pulled to within three points at the top of the table. But the most galling result for Guardiola came at Turf Moor, where the Ben Mee Team fought for a precious victory that underlined the absurdity of Spurs’ win at City last weekend. As the scoreline flashed up on the screen, you could easily picture Guardiola turning to his £100m gardener, Jack Grealish, and pleading with him to make it all make sense. Of course, Guardiola was not the only manager driven to distraction after Spurs’ latest Spursiness. The London troupe’s own ringmaster, Antonio Conte, was so bewildered that he found himself questioning everything he thought he knew about himself, football and stereotypes about temperamental sorts. “No one deserves this type of situation,” whimpered Conte to English media a week after complaining that interviews translated from Italian media often tended to make him seem like a fickle galoot. “I came in to try to improve the situation in Tottenham but maybe in this moment, I don’t know, I’m not so good to improve the situation,” he continued. “I’m trying to do everything to change the situation but the situation is not changing,” he waahed before intimating that he may be prepared to flee Spurs if something or other doesn’t change. “Someone has to speak about the race for the fourth place, and the reality from the last five games is we have to pay attention to not fight for the relegation zone. This is the truth. This is the reality. When this type of situation happens, maybe there is something wrong. I don’t want to close my eyes, I want to take my responsibility, if I have the responsibility. I am open, I am open for every decision because I want to help Tottenham. From the first day I arrived here I want to help Tottenham. I repeat: I am too honest to close my eyes and continue in this way, and also take my salary.

2/25/2022,"The US high school musical has become something of a phenomenon and this one has many of the elements you might expect. A sexual awakening? Check. Cheerleaders? Check. A boy-meets-girl romance? Well, not exactly. Adapted from the 1999 film of the same name, the story follows Megan, the head cheerleader who appears to have it all. She’s popular, smart and has an American football-playing boyfriend. “Being 17 is swell,” she sings. But when her friends and parents suspect she is a lesbian, they ship her off to True Directions, a rehabilitation camp to get her back on “the straight and narrow,” where her future starts to become less clear.  Alice Croft gives a stellar performance as Megan. Twee and unassuming, she is initially reluctant to accept her sexuality. “I can’t be a lesbian, I’m a cheerleader,” she squeals to the audience’s delight. Her singing, at first aptly syrupy sweet, really starts to show its range in the second act. As she discovers her “new colours”, impressive belted high notes bolt out of her as if desperate to be released. The cast of 12 could benefit from a little more space than they have on the relatively small stage at the Turbine. Squashed together on David Shields’s pink Barbie dreamhouse-like set, they quickly change costumes, multi-role and dance to the highest quality – but all their hard work appears a little rushed with so much for them to carry. Too many indistinguishable, repetitive scenes mean that the musical doesn’t reach its potential. There are a few standout numbers: the song Step 2: Pink and Blue has a catchy chorus with some amusing choreography where the students are forced to learn a physicality for their birth genders. But the slower ballads written by Bill Augustin are forgettable and hamper the pace of an already lengthy musical. Still, this is a story that deserves attention. Gay conversion practices continue to be legal in the UK. Although the musical is rooted firmly in comedy, it shines a light on the horrors of such unethical treatments.

2/25/2022,"One of the side effects of watching a recent history true-scam show like Super Pumped, the high-octane, wearisome Showtime anthology series whose first season tracks the rise and fall of Uber’s disgraced CEO, Travis Kalanick, is to wonder in every scene: did this really happen? Or, in the case of Super Pumped specifically: is this dialogue heavily embellished or do tech CEOs flying too close to the sun on a jetstream of cash just sound this deranged?  Kalanick, played with gusto by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is a ball of jumpy, narcissistic energy who speaks in comically grandiose terms. “We fuck the status quo, alright?” he says to his staff. He spins a cease and desist order from the city of San Francisco as “VALIDATION OF OUR STATUS OF DISRUPTORS”, in a shouted speech to the whole office. He draws a huge smiley face on the order with red Sharpie, because “WE ARE IN THE WORLD-CHANGING BUSINESS!” Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber, from Billions co-creators Brian Koppelman and David Levien and based on the book of the same name by New York Times tech reporter Mike Isaac, resembles that gleeful, Sharpied kiss-off. The eight-part series paints a stark portrait of Silicon Valley greed, carelessness and win-at-all-costs betrayals with winking, ambitious flourishes – baroque gamesmanship, ample profanity, fourth-wall breaking, gonzo explainers (the whole palette borrows heavily from Adam McKay’s the Big Short). Quentin Tarantino serves as a discordant, sparsely used narrator. Venture capitalists mull over pitches with anvil-heavy lines like “a unicorn will take flight in this sector”. But the confident style feels, as the show draws on, paper thin, adding little to what is already known about people who would do anything for profit. Super Pumped loosely traces the genuinely wild rise of Uber, founded in 2009 by Garrett Camp (Jon Bass) and Kalanick, but its real emotional arc, so much as one exists, is Kalanick’s tempestuous relationship with investor/mentor Bill Gurley, played with a laconic Texas drawl by everyman actor Kyle Chandler (think Coach Taylor, but a billionaire). Gurley meets Kalanick as he’s still licking his wounds from a past start-up failure, leaning heavily on his mom Bonnie (Elisabeth Shue, too young for the role) and starter girlfriend Angie (Annie Chang). Gurley is skeptical of Kalanick’s bombast (in one the show’s more effective flourishes, enactments of Kalanick’s embellishments fade to green screen, then a recounting of the the unflattering, mundane truth.) But he’s sold on Uber’s potential, thus funding an accelerating merry-go-round of aggressive growth, scandal, weaseling out of said scandal, repeat. In the five episodes available for review, Super Pumped rifles through Uber’s many PR debacles: the “boob-er” comment, the undisclosed spying on drivers, the dubious finances; the time senior executive Emil Michael (Babak Tafti) floated the idea of surveilling critical journalists; Uber’s toxic culture of sexism and sexual harassment exposed by Susan Fowler’s (Eva Victor) viral 2017 blog post and subsequent memoir, Whistleblower, relayed in fourth wall-breaking narrative. Same for the video of a belligerent Kalanick arguing with Uber driver Fawzi Kamel (Mousa Hussein Kraish, one of the only drivers depicted in the series) in 2017. It’s a quirk of timing that Super Pumped premieres within the same month as Netflix’s Inventing Anna, on “Soho grifter” Anna Delvey; Apple’s WeCrashed, on the rise and fall of WeWork; and Hulu’s The Dropout, on Theranos and convicted fraudster Elizabeth Holmes. All four series tackle highly publicized scandals of the mid-2010s that fall somewhere on the continuum of ruthless capitalism to full-scale scam. The appeal of all of these headline-to-screen shows is the chance to see known facts glossed and dramatized with celebrities, to have insight into the whims of the ultra-rich, and to enter the board rooms we otherwise would not have access to. On that count, Super Pumped mostly delivers. The episodes are stuffed with the bread and butter of building a Silicon Valley unicorn, compulsively rendered in the language of war to the point of redundancy: battles (competition) and armies (drivers) and weapons (illegal surveillance); deals made, rejected, or outright sabotaged by Kalanick’s egomaniacal whims. As Uber grows and disrupts, it courts ever stronger enemies: taxi and livery groups, transportation departments, international governments and a who’s who of real-life Silicon Valley figures played for no more than name recognition, with the unfortunate exception of Uber board member Arianna Huffington (Uma Thurman, a cringey caricature of the HuffPost founder.) At its best, Super Pumped pokes at the dubious ethics of Silicon Valley – even the guys ostensibly trying to do the right thing, such as Gurley’s determination to allow drivers to collect tips, are ultimately focused on the bottom line. But it’s a discordant, tiring watch. The show’s imitation of the “no bullshit” obscenity of bro-y Silicon Valley, in both language and style (boardroom dynamics rendered as a video game smackdown, for example) wears to the point of parody, and begins to undermine its critique. The same dynamic plays on repeat: Kalanick is aggressive and uncompromising; Gurley tries to rein him in; Kalanick mostly wins, somehow; the drivers, mostly offscreen with the exception of Kamel, lose. Presumably, the end of the season will depict Kalanick’s 2017 ouster in a board coup led by Gurley. The road to that breakdown will likely prompt many a google search, but as a series of recreations, Super Pumped buys into the same view of business as Uber: a game to be won or lost, with a trail of destruction in its wake.

2/25/2022,"Michael Molineaux, who has died aged 62 of a cardiac arrest, was an independent man of great integrity and principle. As a lawyer, he was admired and respected for his intelligent and perspicacious mind, and renowned for solving the most complex problems.Born in Blenheim, New Zealand, he was the youngest of three children of Barbara (nee Kirby), and Paul Molineaux, a judge. As a small boy, Michael was mischievous, testing boundaries and needing to understand how everything worked. Toys and mechanical objects were frequently taken apart and sometimes reassembled. The family moved to Western Samoa in the 1960s when Michael’s father was appointed attorney general there. Returning to New Zealand, Michael attended Medbury school and then Christ College, both in Christchurch. Outside school, Paul introduced Michael and his brother, Chris, to fly-fishing – a gift from their father that would remain with them for their entire lives.  Michael was an exceptionally gifted student and sportsman. Aged 16, he went to the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, gaining an MSc in engineering geology (1984). He gained a master’s in soil mechanics from Imperial College London (1986). Unconventionally at the time, Michael then turned his mind to law, doing a conversion course and law finals, then a master’s in law at Queen Mary and Westfield College in London. He practised as an intellectual property lawyer at Allen & Overy (1991-99), where he and I met (I am also an IP lawyer), and we became life partners. In 2001 he became a partner of the law firm Haarmann Hemmelrath, then head of intellectual property for Marconi (later part of Ericsson) from 2005-09. Michael loved travelling and experiencing different cultures. In the 90s he was part of an Operation Raleigh expedition engaged in an engineering project in Zimbabwe. He also travelled extensively in Sri Lanka. Spiritually, he read widely and developed an interest in Buddhism – he had taken Buddhism apart in his head, put it back together and it made sense to him. We lived in Wandsworth, south London, before relocating to Basel, Switzerland, in 2010. Michael was a warm, generous and highly intelligent man, who thought deeply about all matters. He needed to understand how it all worked. Always with a twinkle in his eye, he had a wonderful sense of humour. He is survived by me and by his sister, Janet. His brother, Chris, died shortly after Michael.",News/Law,Michael Molineaux obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/feb/24/michael-molineaux-obituary
2/25/2022,"On Saturday night, flushed with the glow of the stunning 3-2 win at Manchester City, Antonio Conte declared that his Tottenham players were the best group he had worked with in terms of attitude. On Tuesday lunchtime, the manager cut a relaxed and contented figure at a media briefing, suggesting that his relentless messaging about mentality, the need to suffer, to live and breathe the job – particularly the lows – were getting through. To those in attendance, it seemed like a turning point in Conte’s near four-month tenure. After the home Premier League losses to Southampton and Wolves, a penny had dropped with the players and Conte wanted to throw all his energy behind the shift in momentum.  Now this. On the stereotypical miserable night at Burnley on Wednesday, Spurs and Conte reverted to type; the team following a thrilling high with another fist-eatingly frustrating defeat – their fourth in five league games, going back to the one at Chelsea on 23 January – and Conte overcome by darkness and rage. Perhaps it was the pre-match hope that made it even worse but, in a remarkable display of soul-baring, Conte said that he could not go on this way. He would not close his eyes and continue to collect his massive salary while sure-footed strides forward proved elusive. “Maybe in this moment … I don’t know … I’m not so good to improve the situation,” he said. It was the latest in a long line of eruptions and the first thing to say is that Conte has form for being extremely outspoken after matches, when he feels the blood run hot. It has tended to be after losses – remember NS Mura in the Europa Conference League or the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final at Chelsea – but, in a sense, he did something similar after the win against City, going over the top in the other direction. Conte will surely calm down. The wild swings are a part of him. That was the hope at Spurs on Thursday and he is due to face the media as normal on Friday afternoon. Yet there was something else about his Burnley meltdown, something new and troubling. It was the pronounced sense of helplessness, the resignation. As always in these situations, given Conte’s reputation as the arch politician, it is tempting to wonder what he is trying to leverage. Previously, leading up to and during the January transfer window, there was the feeling or fear that if Conte did not get the signings he wanted, he could quit. But what now? January did not go as Conte would have wanted, with the club missing out on their priority targets: Adama Traoré went to Barcelona and Luis Díaz joined Liverpool. They were able to shed a clutch of unwanted players, chiefly Tanguy Ndombele, Giovani Lo Celso, Bryan Gil and Dele Alli, and they added Rodrigo Bentancur and Dejan Kulusevski to make the squad “more complete” – in Conte’s words. But January has gone and the summer is a long way away. It feels a little early for Conte to begin applying the pressure for the grander rebuild (although far from inconceivable that he would do so) and it is simply on him to work with what he has got for the final three months of the season. Is Conte nervous that he does not have enough? Yes. It is probably the main driver behind his outburst at Burnley because do not read too much into him turning the mirror to face himself. He does not doubt his own ability. He never will. It is not him, it is them. The players have to dig deeper. Conte has said that the prospective manager of a club can make his assessments from the outside but there is no substitute for seeing the players on the training pitch. It is when the truth presents itself and Conte appears to have realised pretty quickly that the technical levels of those he inherited was rather lower than he had hoped for. Even when the team went unbeaten in his first nine league games, winning six, he warned that they had struggled repeatedly. Conte’s biggest problem and the one that has led to the greatest friction with the board is the speed at which he and they would like to drive the squad from the current transitional period. It is similar to the one that Mauricio Pochettino found upon his arrival as the manager in 2014; there will be bumps in terms of results. Conte wants finished article signings, experienced players to make an immediate difference – which is expensive – but, so far, he has been given a couple of prospects in Bentancur and Kulusevski, albeit decent ones. In all honesty, what did Conte expect? Under Daniel Levy, Spurs have always sought to be shrewd in the market, taking players with the potential to develop over a longer period. The issue of whether the notoriously demanding and impatient Conte would be a fit for Spurs has always hung over his appointment. There has been the feeling for some weeks that Conte might not last beyond the summer transfer window. The potential for conflict over signings and squad reshaping is high. Could Conte walk out before then? The threat has never been greater and yet he has to know that his reputation would not escape damage were he to do so. It would be a dereliction. So far at Spurs, his scorched earth style has had mixed results and, to some people, he went too far at Burnley. It is not just them. It has to be him, too.",Sport/Football,Spurs bank on Conte cooling off but his meltdown should worry them | David Hytner,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/24/spurs-antonio-conte-meltdown-worry-poor-fit-tottenham
2/25/2022,"Women in England will be able to access abortion pills more easily for the next six months, but the temporary “pills by post” scheme brought in because of Covid will then be scrapped in September. Maggie Throup, the public health minister, confirmed on Thursday that women seeking to terminate a pregnancy by taking the two pills involved at home would lose that right at the end of August.  Abortion law was amended in March 2020, as the coronavirus pandemic was unfolding, to allow women in England to be sent and take both pills at home instead of having to take the first one at a clinic or hospital. The change was introduced at a time when much NHS care was being disrupted to ensure that women seeking a termination could still get one without needing to go to a health facility. In a written ministerial statement Throup said the arrangements that were due to end next month would be extendeduntil midnight on 29 August. But she added: “The government will end the temporary approval put in place at the beginning of the pandemic that allows women to take both pills for early medical abortion up to 10 weeks gestation at home.” The pre-pandemic system will return from 1 September. It required women who had decided to have an early medical abortion to have an initial consultation with a clinician and take the first pill in a healthcare setting before being able to take the second one at home. Doctors, midwives, pro-choice groups and abortion providers want the government to continue letting women take both pills at home. They include the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the British Medical Association (BMA) and the Royal College of Midwives. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) has called that scheme a “safe, effective and world-leading service” and warned of “disastrous” consequences for women if it was axed in September. “If at the end of this six-month period the government were indeed to revoke legal permission for this service it would be a shameful betrayal of women and a decision devoid of both evidence or justice,” said Clare Murphy, the BPAS chief executive. Ending telemedical abortion care “would force vulnerable women in the most difficult if circumstances, who cannot access in-clinic treatment, to resort to illegal methods again and face criminal sanctions as a result” for buying pills illegally online, added Murphy. Procuring an abortion or helping someone have one remains a criminal offence despite the Abortion Act 1967. Requests from women in the UK to buy pills online has fallen by 88% since the scheme began in 2020, research shows. Dr Zoe Greaves, the chair of the BMA’s medical ethics committee, said the decision “puts the wellbeing and safety of women at risk. Those most affected by this change will be those who are at greatest risk of harm, including women who are victims of sexual violence or domestic abuse and the financially vulnerable. “It is a decision which puts politics before women’s health.” Robert Winston, the fertility pioneer, has urged ministers to continue with the scheme because home abortions are safe and make it easier for women to have an early termination. Throup said the decision to scrap the scheme in September would be kept under review. But sources at the Department of Health and Social Care indicated that they would resist pressure to make the pills-at-home scheme permanent. The Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child, an anti-choice group, said that letting women receive abortion drugs without an in-person consultation was “reckless and deadly”. The future of the scheme has reportedly led to disagreements involving ministers and civil servants. Lord Kamall, the technology minister, recently called it “this difficult decision”.",News/World news,England abortion ‘pills by post’ scheme to be scrapped in September,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/england-abortion-pill-by-post-scheme-scrapped-september-change-law-covid-pandemic
