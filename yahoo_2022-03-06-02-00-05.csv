3/6/2022,"Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine isn't working out the way he had planned, said Stephen Quackenbush, an associate professor at the University of Missouri. He's director of the Defense and Strategic Studies Program in the Truman School of Government and Public Affairs. ""I think he has made a terrible mistake,"" Quackenbush said of the Ukraine invasion. ""It has been a terrible mistake to attack. He thought the Ukrainian people would welcome the advance and it would be an easy victory."" Instead Russian forces are meeting stiff resistance, taking control of just one major city as of Friday. There have been large protests in Russia. ""This is very unpopular in Russia, especially among those who understand what's happening,"" Quackenbush said. If Putin loses power related to this, it will be because he loses the support of the oligarchs who back him, not because of public protests, Quackenbush said. Sanctions announced this week by U.S. President Joe Biden are targeted at Russian oligarchs. ""These economic sanctions are devastating the economy,"" Quackenbush said.

""He wants a divided West,"" Quackenbush said of Putin. ""He's done a remarkable job of unifying NATO."" Even Germany, which in the past has been hesitant, is involved now because the threat is real, he said. ""Former President Trump did a lot to undermine NATO,"" Quackenbush said. The United Nations General Assembly this week voted to condemn the Russian invasion, further isolating the country.

""I don't think China wants to get involved in this war,"" Quackenbush said, citing one factor. Although Russia has a history of attacking its neighbors, that's not part of China's recent history, he said. China wants economic and political stability. ""China focuses on building a very strong economy,"" Quackenbush said.

""My expectation is eventually — we don't know how long, maybe a month or two — Russia will be able to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses,"" he said. He called Kyiv, the capital, Ukraine's ""center of gravity."" If Kyiv is captured, that will be key to the Russian effort, he said. If Russia occupies Ukraine, it will face ongoing popular resistance, he said. ""There will be insurgency fighting,"" Quackenbush said. There haven't been many good moments for the Russian military, he said. ""I think that so far, the Russian performance has been disappointing from a Russian perspective, I would suspect,"" Quackenbush said. rmckinney@columbiatribune.com 573-815-1719 This article originally appeared on Columbia Daily Tribune: Mizzou professor says Russia's invasion of Ukraine 'terrible mistake'",World/Columbia Daily Tribune,"Vladimir Putin made 'terrible mistake' invading Ukraine, University of Missouri prof says",https://news.yahoo.com/vladimir-putin-made-terrible-mistake-233015862.html

 Russian President Vladimir Putin in a meeting on Saturday warned that Ukraine might lose its statehood ""if they continue doing what they are doing,"" The New York Times reported. ""The current leadership needs to understand that if they continue doing what they are doing, they risk the future of Ukrainian statehood,"" Putin said in Moscow, according to the newspaper. ""If that happens, they will have to be blamed for that."" During his meeting he also likened sanctions imposed by Western countries toward Russia as ""akin to a declaration of war,"" the Times reported, demonstrating an escalation in rhetoric by Russia amid its invasion of Ukraine. Those remarks were rebuked by some U.S. lawmakers. ""Weaponizing migration & attacks on nuke plants are akin to a declaration of war too,"" Senate Intelligence Vice Chairman Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) tweeted on Saturday. ""The problem is NATO would quickly annihilate #Russia's conventional forces & Putin would then use chemical,biological & non-strategic nukes to freeze the conflict."" Ukraine has been independent for more than 30 years following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia's invasion of the sovereign nation has been widely condemned by the international community, and Ukraine has called to be included in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military alliance. Russia has demanded that Ukraine not be allowed into NATO. Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a European Union membership application as the former Soviet Union country seeks to join the bloc. ""Our goal is to be together with all Europeans and, most importantly, to be on an equal footing,"" the Ukrainian president said during a video address, The New York Times reported. ""I'm sure it's fair. I'm sure it's possible.""",World/The Hill,Putin warns Ukraine might lose statehood 'if they continue doing what they are doing',https://news.yahoo.com/putin-warns-ukraine-might-lose-160156168.html
