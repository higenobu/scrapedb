5/17/2022,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan said on Tuesday it would start conducting ""test tourism"" in the form of limited package tours in May as a way of gathering information prior to a full re-opening of the country to tourism. Though tourism was a major pillar of Japan's economy, tourists have not been permitted to enter since it adopted strict border controls in 2020 at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Regulations have been loosened slightly to allow students and some business travelers to enter. But, individual tourists remain barred despite calls from industry leaders hoping to restart tourism to take advantage of the yen, which has fallen to 20-year lows. The Tourism Agency said on Tuesday that it would start allowing small group tours to enter from later this month as ""test cases"" to gain information for a broader resumption of tourism at an unspecified future date. Tourists who have been triple-vaccinated and come from the United States, Australia, Thailand and Singapore will be allowed to take part in the tours, which will be strictly planned in conjunction with travel agencies and accompanied at all times by tour conductors, it added in a statement. ""This venture will allow us to verify compliance and emergency responses for infection prevention and formulate guidelines for travel agencies and accommodation operators to keep in mind,"" it said. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said earlier this month during a speech in London that he would bring Japan's border controls into line with other wealthy democracies in June, but no further details have been given, including when the country will fully open its borders to tourists again. In 2019, Japan hosted 31.9 million foreign visitors, who spent 4.81 trillion yen.

5/17/2022,"STORY: Vladimir Putin appeared to climb down on Monday from Russia's objections to Sweden and Finland joining NATO, saying Moscow had no issues with them entering the U.S.-led military alliance. PUTIN: ""I want to inform you, dear colleagues, that Russia has no problem with those states, it hasn't. So, in this regard, expansion by the addition of those countries poses no direct threat for us. But the expansion of military infrastructure into this territory would certainly provoke our response. What that (response) will be - we will see what threats are created for us."" The comments appeared to mark a major shift in rhetoric. Moscow for decades has cast NATO expansion as a direct threat to Russia's security, including citing it as a justification for the invasion of Ukraine itself. Russia's invasion has shaken up Europe's security architecture and forced Sweden and Finland to choose sides after staying out of NATO during the Cold War. Finland and Sweden now say they want the protection offered by NATO's treaty, under which an attack on any member is an attack on all. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson made the announcement Monday. ""Our 200-year-long standing policy of military non-alignment has served Sweden well but the issue at hand is whether military non-alignment will keep serving us well. And Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine is not only illegal and indefensible, it also undermines the European security order that Sweden builds its security on."" Swedish and Finnish officials have said Putin has only himself to blame for their decisions to join NATO. But the plans might be hitting a snag. NATO member Turkey said it would not approve either bid, with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan saying Monday that Sweden and Finland should not bother sending delegations to Ankara to persuade Turkey. Sweden and Finland need each of NATO's 30 members to approve their applications.",Politics/Reuters Videos,"Putin backs off hardline on Sweden, Finland NATO bids",https://news.yahoo.com/putin-backs-off-hardline-sweden-000950592.html
