1/29/2022,"CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — Gov. Jim Justice has a message for singer and actress Bette Midler, who called West Virginians “poor, illiterate and strung out” in a tweet after Sen. Joe Manchin refused to support President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better Act. The 70-year-old Republican governor ended his televised State of the State address Thursday night by lifting up his English bulldog and flashing its rear end to the cameras and crowd. “Babydog tells Bette Midler and all those out there: Kiss her hiney,"" Justice said, grinning as people applauded and some gave him a standing ovation. Justice had spent more than an hour touting the state's accomplishments, including two recently announced economic development projects. “Absolutely too many people doubted us,"" he said. ""They never believed in West Virginia. ... They told every bad joke in the world about us.” The crowd in the House of Delegates gallery included lawmakers, state Supreme Court justices, agency heads and members of the high school girl's basketball team Justice coaches, who were sitting in the gallery. Not everyone was amused. In a tweet, West Virginia Democratic Del. Shawn Fluharty called the move “embarrassing and beneath the office.” “The @WVGovernor brought his Babydog and pony show to the State of the State and pulled this stunt as some bold statement. It was nothing short of embarrassing and beneath the office,” he said. “Jim Justice habitually lowers the bar of our state. They don’t laugh with us, but at us.” Manchin, a Democrat, effectively tanked his party’s signature $2 trillion domestic policy initiative that would have poured billions of dollars into child care, health care and other services. “What #JoeManchin, who represents a population smaller than Brooklyn, has done to the rest of America, who wants to move forward, not backward, like his state, is horrible,” Midler tweeted. “He sold us out. He wants us all to be just like his state, West Virginia. Poor, illiterate and strung out.” After receiving backlash, Midler apologized “to the good people of WVA” for her “outburst"" in follow-up tweet later that day. The Associated Press sent an email to Midler's publicist Friday requesting comment.",Politics/Associated Press,Gov tells Bette Midler to kiss dog's 'hiney' -- and shows it,https://news.yahoo.com/gov-tells-bette-midler-kiss-160823546.html
1/29/2022,"Kellyanne Conway announced her upcoming memoir on Thursday and received a sharp reminder of her most brazen moments while serving as senior White House counselor to former President Donald Trump. “Here’s The Deal” — due out on May 24 — will be an “open and vulnerable account” of Conway’s “journey all the way to the White House and beyond,” according to promotional material. Critics, though, recalled Conway’s penchant for “alternative facts,” her downplaying of the COVID-19 pandemic, her infamous “Bowling Green massacre” comment and the many, many, many times she cynically tried to spin away the chaos that engulfed Trump’s presidency.

1/29/2022,"A Republican-led Pennsylvania court on Friday ruled that the state's mail-in voting law is unconstitutional. Driving the news: Three Republican judges sided with Republican challengers and ruled that no-excuse mail-in voting is prohibited under the state's constitution. Two Democrats on the panel dissented. Get market news worthy of your time with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf will likely appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, triggering a stay and leaving the law in place while the high court considers the case, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. Republicans, led by former President Trump, pushed baseless claims about mail-in voting and fraud after the 2020 election when the state went to President Joe Biden and cast doubt on the voting law. The big picture: The Pennsylvania state legislature passed a law in 2019 with bipartisan support to allow no-excuse mail voting for all voters, AP reports. Before the 2019 law, the mail-in voting option was available for individuals unable to vote in person for specific reasons. Republicans first sought to overturn the mail-in voting law directly after Trump's defeat in 2020, when they unsuccessfully sought to invalidate millions of mail ballots, per the Inquirer.

1/29/2022,"A standard 2021 Porsche Taycan has broken the Guinness World Record for the shortest charging time to cross the United States in an electric vehicle. It only needed a cumulative charge time of 2 hours, 26 minutes and 48 seconds to cover a 2,834.5-mile drive from Los Angeles to New York. While the record it broke is highly specific, there was a previous holder: A Kia EV6, which had to be charged for 7 hours, 10 minutes and 1 second to make a similar, but just slightly longer, trip from New York to LA.  Wayne Gerdes, known for his efficiency driving and for coining the term ""hypermiling,"" was behind the wheel for the record-breaking journey. Hypermiling, as you may know, involves the use of adjustments and driving techniques to maximize the vehicle's fuel use. Porsche told Engadget that Gerdes drove normal speeds and sometimes even went faster, depending on the charge level, for the duration of the trip.  As for the vehicle itself, it was equipped with the company's Performance Battery Plus, which has a higher gross capacity than the base battery option, and Adaptive Cruise Control. For the attempt to be recognized by the Guinness World Records, every mile of the journey had to be filmed and the vehicle's GPS had to be tracked. Gerdes said that the first time he charged a Taycan on a 350KW charger, its battery levels went from 6 to 82 percent in just 22 minutes. He relied on Electrify America's CCS DC fast charging network for the trip, since the company is a partner for this attempt. Porsche first revealed the Taycan electric sedan in 2019 and started making deliveries in 2020. The automaker has released several variants since then, including the category-blurring Cross Turismo EV.",U.S./Engadget,Porsche sent its Taycan EV cross-country to claim a 'charging time' record,https://news.yahoo.com/porsche-taycan-ev-cross-country-charging-time-record-160032782.html
1/29/2022,"BUDVA, Montenegro (AP) — Tennis star Novak Djokovic received honors at a small Adriatic Sea resort in Montenegro on Friday even as doubts re-emerged about the positive COVID-19 test he used to try to compete in the Australian Open. The BBC on Friday reported discrepancies in the serial numbers of tests Serbian authorities administered to Djokovic in the days prior to his trip to Australia, suggesting possible irregularities in the way they were issued. Djokovic's media team and the Institute of Public Health in Serbia did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the Associated Press. Senior Serbian health officials have previously said that Djokovic's test was valid and issued by a relevant institution. Djokovic was deported from Australia and barred from playing in the Australian Open earlier this month after a 11-day visa saga on the eve of the tournament because he failed to meet Australia’s strict COVID-19 vaccination requirements. To enter Australia, Djokovic submitted a positive COVID test issued in Serbia from Dec. 16 for a visa exemption on the grounds that he had contracted COVID-19 prior to the tournament. The 34-year-old player is not vaccinated and the Australian government later decided to cancel his visa and deport Djokovic, saying his presence in Australia could stir anti-vaccination sentiments. Djokovic has said he would make no public comments until the end of the Australia Open tournament. On Friday, several hundred people cheered outside the municipal building in the small Adriatic town of Budva as Djokovic arrived to receive a plaque declaring him an honorary citizen of the town. Top local official Marko Carevic also presented Djokovic with an Orthodox Christian icon, expressing gratitude for helping “preserve the Serbian people and the Serbian church in Montenegro.” Djokovic is adored in his native Serbia and among the Serbs in neighboring Montenegro, a small nation of some 620,000 people. Since he returned home, Djokovic was seen visiting churches and attending liturgies in both Serbia and Montenegro. A video posted on social networks showed a mask-less Djokovic taking communion from Serbian Patriarch Porfirije on an Orthodox Christian holiday, using the same spoon along with other faithful at a church in Belgrade.",World/Associated Press,Djokovic feted in Montenegro amid new virus test doubts,https://news.yahoo.com/djokovic-feted-montenegro-amid-virus-132107486.html
1/29/2022,"“The Daily Show” host Trevor Noah on Thursday pointed out the basic flaw in an argument Fox News personalities are pressing against President Joe Biden’s promise to nominate a Black woman to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson have led the chorus of criticism on the conservative network, claiming Biden’s pledge is “beyond extremely divisive.” But being a Black woman isn’t the sole qualification for the job, Noah noted. “Biden is going to pick a Black woman who is also qualified,” he said. “These people act like Biden is just going to show up to the mall and be like, ‘Yo, Shaniqua, come with me.’” “And why not try to make the Supreme Court a little more representative of the country it represents?” the comedian asked. “I mean, their rulings impact the lives of every person in the country.” Noah then expressed some faux sympathy for Tucker Carlson. “Of course he’s upset. Think about it. For almost all of American history, the entire Supreme Court was white dudes with bow ties and weird hair. Now that’s all gone. It’s all gone. Where’s Tucker’s representation, huh?” Watch the video here: This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.
