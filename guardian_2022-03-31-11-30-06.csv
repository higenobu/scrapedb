3/31/2022,"Manchester United will return to Australia for two matches to be played in front of expected bumper crowds at the MCG on the Premier League club’s first overseas pre-season tour since 2019. The Victorian government on Thursday confirmed the matches in Melbourne against four-time A-League Men champions Melbourne Victory on 15 July and fellow Premier League club Crystal Palace four days later. United, who are expected to have a new manager in place by July, last visited Australia three years ago, when they faced Leeds United and Perth Glory in Perth. That was the third time United have toured to Australia, following visits in 1999, when they faced the Socceroos in Melbourne, and in 2013 for an exhibition game in Sydney against an A-League All Stars side. Disruption due to Covid-19 meant the club has not been able to venture out of the UK on tour since. The MCG has a capacity of 100,000 and given the huge interest in United and their star-studded squad, the Victorian government said it expected the games to attract around 150,000 fans. “This is a great opportunity to see one of the world’s greatest sporting teams play in Melbourne – the nation’s sporting capital,” Victoria’s minister for employment Jaala Pulford said.

3/31/2022,"It seems fitting that Wellingtonians woke to an eerie morning, mist clinging to the hills and harbour, as news broke that Moana Jackson, who spent so much of his life in Wellington’s Wainuiōmata, had died. The lawyer, teacher, activist, father and grandfather was the most articulate, original and forceful intellectual of his generation. He was, too, perhaps the humblest, and so flattery is ill-fitting on a man who gave so much without ever asking for anything in return. But the acknowledgment must stand: Moana Jackson was a rangatira (chief) of the highest rank and his contribution to New Zealand’s political and intellectual life are without equal. That is not to imply, though, that his contributions came without a cost. In 1988, after publishing He Whaipaanga Hou, a landmark report establishing that the criminal justice system was racist, Matua Moana was the target of the very worst letter writers to the national newspapers and the most vicious callers to talkback radio. And yet he never took a back step. In the following decades he would argue again and again that the criminal justice system is racist, colonisation is responsible, and that the best means of restoring the mana of victims, offenders and the people who administer the system is tikanga. In short, a Māori legal system. At the time, this was radical. But 34 years later and that argument is orthodox. It’s a mark of Matua Moana’s vision that he could diagnose mass incarceration before we had the vocabulary to describe it. He Whaipaanga Hou didn’t compromise in its argument that without systemic change Māori would continue to suffer discrimination and disproportionate consequences in the criminal justice system. Today, Māori make up more than 50% of the prison population despite making up only 15% of the population as a whole – a terrifying vindication of that very argument. It’s a mark of Matua Moana’s courage that, after correctly diagnosing the problem and predicting how it would unfold, he was willing to offer an uncompromising treatment. A separate Māori legal system. The data and the times would eventually catch up with Matua – it’s rare to find an intellectual or politician who would disagree that colonisation is responsible for disproportionate Māori incarceration rates – but in the 1980s, when Māori were condemned as inherently violent (a “warrior race”) this was scandalous. Who is this Jackson fellow? Who is this “radical”? I remember the first time I heard Matua speak in person. It was in 2014 at Victoria University of Wellington’s law school – Matua Moana’s own alma mater and the school whose students he gave so much to. His topic was Te Tiriti o Waitangi, with an abstract promising a tour of the history and context of that document. Yet Jackson opened with an apology. He had promised his moko (grandchild) that he would make it home in time for afternoon tea. He was sorry if, at a moment’s notice, he had to cut his lecture short. And then, over the next almost two hours, Matua went for it. He exposed the doctrine of discovery for the “legal fiction” that it was, taking us students through a tour of everything from the role of the papal bulls in imperial expansion to the hypocrisies of Captain Cook’s first voyage. But what I cherish from that lecture was how Matua Moana brought it to a close. It wasn’t just a lesson in legal history. It was a story of what was important to him. He told us that, after speaking to themes so traumatic for so many, that he was going home to butter sandwiches and pretend to pour cups of tea for his moko. Today, it’s comforting to imagine that scene. But for his mokopuna (grandchildren) today and the days that follow are devastating. They shared their koro (grandfather) with all Māori. That is a testament to the kindness and generosity of his whānau, a quality their koro was the embodiment of. Intellectuals often mark their reputations on the quality of their thought. But they’re not well known for the clarity of their expression. But it’s impossible to eulogise Matua Moana without remaking upon that soft, smooth voice. The wordiest intellectuals speak in paragraphs. Matua Moana spoke in melodies. “From the moment that the ancestors began to know this land as the Mother, Papatūānuku, stories have had the capacity to guide and teach as well as entertain or warn,” wrote Matua Moana in 2020. Stories were a vital part of his intellectual breakthroughs. He was keen reader of every different storytelling form from novels to essays to poetry. In 2004, when he was arguing for “tupuna title”, a new way to imagine our rights and responsibilities in respect of land, Matua would often draw on the ancient stories of how our ancestors cared for this country. Ka mua, ka muri. “We walk backwards into the future.” It’s impossible to construct a CV for Matua Moana. He simply did too much. He was a co-founder of Māori Legal Service. He was a judge on the Peoples’ International Tribunal in 1993 and again in Canada in 1995. He led the working group tasked with drafting the United Nations declaration on the rights of Indigenous peoples. In 2016, in what was perhaps the culmination of a lifetime of activism, he led the working group that published “Matike Mai,” a blueprint for constitutional transformation in New Zealand. I suspect this kind of praise might embarrass Matua, but it seems remiss not to list his achievements and acknowledge his contribution to Indigenous peoples across the world. I heard Matua Moana speak many times after that lecture in 2014. We both spoke at the 50th anniversary of Hart – Halt All Racist Tours – and he spoke to our trade union leaders and members many times. He would often remind us that one of the only Pākehā institutions that his own Koro was fond of was the trade unions. Radicalism ran in the family. Yet my memories of him remain more personal than intellectual. When we met he was always far keener to talk about what I thought than what he had said. In every interaction – in every speech, lecture and essay – he was always searching for ways to uplift the mana of others. This is another mark of a rangatira of the highest rank. Today, Hinepūkohurangi, the mist maiden who cloaks the Urewera Valley, is travelling down the spine of the North Island helping announce Matua Moana’s passing in Ngāti Porou, Ngāti Kahungunu and Wellington. Jackson lays in Te Waimana under the protection of Te Maunga and Hinepūkohurangi. Tomorrow, he travels home to his marae. On that journey his whānau will carry one of the greatest legacies ever left to Māori society. But it is very much a legacy that belongs to his family first and foremost, to his iwi and hapū and community second, and only to the rest of us third. This country is so much poorer for his passing, but so much richer for his life. The te reo Māori term “Matua” is a respectful form of address for a leader",News/World news,"Moana Jackson was the most articulate, original and forceful intellectual of his generation | Morgan Godfrey",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/moana-jackson-obituary-the-most-articulate-original-and-forceful-intellectual-of-his-generation
3/31/2022,"Major jewellers are ditching Russian diamonds after facing increased scrutiny over how Russia’s state-controlled diamond monopoly could fund Putin’s war on Ukraine. A host of high-profile international jewellers, including American brand Tiffany & Co, Swiss watch and jewellery-maker Chopard, Signet, the largest retailer of diamond jewellery, and Pandora, the world’s largest jeweller, have released statements saying they will stop buying diamonds of Russian origin. In mid-march, the Guardian reported on growing concerns that trade with Russia’s partly state-owned diamond miner was lining Russian state coffers, and could be funding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine; as well how jewellers could easily – and legally – circumnavigate sanctions by buying Russian stones processed through India. In the days since, multiple major retailers said they would stop sourcing Russian diamonds. This week, Pandora and Chopard were the latest to announce the move, with both saying they had instructed all suppliers to stop sourcing raw materials of Russian origin. They followed moves by Tiffany and Signet earlier in March. Russia produces about 30% of the world’s diamonds – 98% of which are mined and sold by Alrosa, an enormous mining monopoly with close ties to the Kremlin. A third of Alrosa is owned by the central government, and another third by regional governments – the Russian republic of Yakutia and its administrations. The company brings in significant profits for its government shareholders, reporting sales of $4.16bn in 2021, resulting in a net profit of 91bn rubles ($943m). Putin has said in the past that it “gives serious revenues to the federal budget and regional budget”. Both the US and UK have introduced sanctions forbidding companies from doing direct business with Alrosa. The sanctions alone, however, are unlikely to stop the flow of Russian diamonds to the west, because the vast majority are exported rough to India, where they are cut and polished. Under US customs rulings, this is considered a “significant transformation” – so polished diamonds can be legally imported as an Indian product, not a Russian one. Decisions over whether to truly pause trade of Alrosa’s diamonds will therefore fall to the industry, and to key certification bodies. Within the sector, however, a storm has been brewing over “responsible sourcing” groups that have remained quiet on sourcing of Russian diamonds, with multiple high-profile members resigning in protest. The Responsible Jewellery Council (RJC) – one of the crucial jewellery watchdogs – was set up to help regulate the sector, improve its reputation, promote responsible sourcing, and eliminate “conflict diamonds” from supply chains. The Guardian reported earlier in March that the council had been accused of silence over Russian diamonds although it has issued guidance that members should comply with sanctions. While Alrosa has stepped down from the organisation’s board, it remains a member and has kept its “responsible” certification. The council has a number of past or present long-term Alrosa customers on its board. Now, the council is facing a wave of exits. Brands that have announced they are leaving over the Russian diamonds issue include Pandora, Richemont, the owner of Cartier, and Kering, the owner of high-fashion brands including Gucci and Saint Laurent. On Wednesday, the organisation’s executive director Iris Van der Veken resigned over its handling of the issue. Van der Veken declined to comment. In a statement, Richemont, the owner of Cartier, said it was leaving the organisation in protest. “Richemont and its maisons do not wish to be members of an industry organisation that includes companies that contribute to financing conflicts and wars.” Pandora representatives said the company was leaving the council after 12 years as a member, over its “failure to suspend Russian companies’ memberships and responsible business certifications and urge its members to suspend business with Russia. Pandora had previously requested that RJC take such actions.” “The war requires all businesses to act with the utmost responsibility regarding any interactions or business dealings with Russia and Belarus. Pandora cannot in good faith be a member of an association that does not share our values,” chief executive Alexander Lacik said. Gucci and Balenciaga owner Kering said the brand “does not want to be associated in any way with business practices that contribute to an endorsement of war.” “The RJC is at a crucial crossroads,” said Cristina Villegas, director of the Mines to Markets program at development organisation Pact. “The current definitions of responsibility are silent on what happens when a company’s assets are being used to directly and indirectly fund an unprovoked conflict that’s displaced millions of people.” RJC chair David A. Bouffard said in a statement that the council had “commenced an arm’s length, independent, third-party legal assessment … to consider the status of Alrosa as an RJC member”. “The pace of this process may be frustrating, but this is an unprecedented situation, which is constantly changing and requires that the time be taken, to ensure that due process is followed as exhaustively as possible.” Bouffard said the process would conclude “imminently”. Brad Brooks-Rubin, strategic adviser to the council, said the exodus of members was significant for the industry. “If the current trajectory continues and more members [leave]… there’s not another competing organisation in the industry,” he said. “That leaves the jewellery industry exposed to real concerns about: what standards are you implementing? What does it mean to be responsible, sustainable, ethical? The RJC has provided that – and if it’s not the RJC, what takes its place?” Brooks-Rubin had spoken out earlier in March to criticise the lack of action or transparency on Russian diamonds, saying the council’s action against Alrosa had been “insufficient”. He said decisions about boycotting diamond-producing countries were complex, with millions of international jobs and livelihoods depending on the flow of diamonds. “If 30-40% of the supply chain is off the market, then that affects everybody. That affects prices, that affects the supply chain, that affects every entity in the entire industry.” He said the council needed to be clear and transparent about the challenges it faced.",News/World news,Major jewellers to cease buying Russian-origin diamonds after increased scrutiny,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/major-jewellers-to-cease-buying-russian-origin-diamonds-after-increased-scrutiny
3/31/2022,"Key integrity bodies suffered direct cuts to their funding in the federal budget, while others continue to be starved of the resources they need to hold the government accountable, analysis reveals. Tuesday night’s budget reduced funding for the commonwealth ombudsman, the administrative appeals tribunal and the Australian Law Reform Commission, an analysis by the Centre for Public Integrity shows. Funding for the Australian National Audit Office and the Australian Broadcasting Commission, meanwhile, is far below what is needed, and represents significant cuts in resources in real terms compared with 2012 levels. The audit office, which has published reports highly critical of the government, would have a budget of $124m had its funding kept pace with inflation since 2012. The budget was $11m short of that, which the Centre for Public Integrity said represented a 9.7% cut in real terms. The ABC’s budget should have been $1.4bn to account for inflation, the analysis said, but was $255m short of that, representing a 17.67% cut in real terms. The budget also only allowed $67m over four years for the Coalition’s proposed anti-corruption commission model, which it has so far failed to legislate, despite promises to do so. The centre’s research director, Dr Catherine Williams, said the budget showed the government was “not serious about delivering on its promise” for the commonwealth integrity commission. Williams said funding for accountability and integrity bodies must be made independent of the normal budget processes, to avoid government interference. “Accountability institutions safeguard the rule of law and make democracy work,” she said. “They need to be independently funded, through an Independent Funding Tribunal, to make sure they can continue to fulfil their mandates no matter who’s in power.” Such a proposal has been championed by the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption, which has been lobbying to have its funding secured outside of the vagaries of individual budgets and governments. The budget papers also revealed a change in the government’s description of the status of its anti-corruption commission. Last year’s budget said the government “has committed to establish the Commonwealth Integrity Commission, though legislation to establish the entity has not yet passed the parliament”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Tuesday’s budget dropped the reference to this commitment, saying: “The establishment of the Commonwealth Integrity Commission (CIC) is subject to the passage of legislation. Funding for the CIC is reflected in the Budget and ASL will be reflected once the CIC is established.” An Australia Institute democracy and accountability senior researcher, Bill Browne, said the change in wording was “hopefully” an oversight. “The government has been giving mixed messages about the timeline for an integrity commission for years,” he said. “Senior Liberals, including Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, have said that Australia needs a strong integrity commission at the federal level. “It has been over 1,200 days since the Morrison government announced it would implement a national integrity commission, and there is still none to be seen.”",News/Australia news,Federal budget cuts to integrity bodies spark calls for independent funding,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/31/federal-budget-cuts-to-integrity-bodies-spark-calls-for-independent-funding
3/31/2022,"A helicopter has disappeared and is feared to have crashed at Mount Disappointment, north of Melbourne. The helicopter was travelling in a convoy with another helicopter over the area, which is 60km north of the Victorian capital, when it disappeared just after 9.30am on Thursday. Police in Victoria and other emergency crews are searching the region for the missing helicopter. “At this stage the second helicopter [from the convoy] is yet to be located,” a police spokeswoman said. “Emergency services are in the area searching.” A Bombardier Challenger jet aircraft, operated by Cobham SAR services on behalf of the the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, is scouring the region, along with an air ambulance helicopter and another helicopter. Mount Disappointment is on the the southern end of the Great Dividing Range. The 800m peak was named by explorers Hamilton Hume and William Hovell in 1824, who were disappointed that the dense tree growth prevented them from being able to see Port Phillip Bay from the summit. In 1944, two Royal Australian Air Force dive bombers crashed into the side of the mountain which was obscured by a low-hanging cloud, killing five people. Two more RAAF members died in a crash on the mountain in 1942, and another in 1953. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau said it had been notified of the incident and is gathering further information.
