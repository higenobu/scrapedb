12/24/2021,"The writing of Joan Didion, who has died 87, was mantra-like, mannered, even “set in its own modulations” (that was Martin Amis’s snipe). It was also unique and remarkable. Even the shape of her books was uncommon, the sentences spaced on pages as tall and narrow as king-sized cigarette packets. She had practised that incantatory style since her mother had presented her, aged five, with a notebook and a suggestion that she calm her anxious self by writing. Her family had long been settled in California, then chiefly an agricultural state, a location that mattered to Didion’s story, and to her story-telling.  She was born in Sacramento, the daughter of Eduene (nee Jerrett) and Frank Didion, a finance officer with the US army, poker player, and, after the second world war, a real estate dealer. Joan was an army brat on her father’s stations, and her juvenile fantasies set out in that notebook were doomy – death in the desert, suicide in the surf. The only printed influence on her work she ever cited was Ernest Hemingway, as she had typed out his prose in order to master the keyboard and his syntax: the exact placement of words was the basis of her style as it had been of his. “Grammar is a piano I play by ear,” she claimed. Studying English literature at the University of California, Berkeley, taught her to audit meaning, dissect language and triangulate evidence, and modified her original ambition, acting, into writing as performance. Didion won Vogue’s Prix de Paris contest in 1956, and was rewarded with a copywriter’s job, dogsbodying with proximity to glamour, in New York, rising to associate features editor over eight years at Condé Nast. She said later that she had been in love with the city’s promise, excited by meeting whoever was in town — models, millionaires, magnates — but had remained an exiled westerner not at home in New York. With a portable typewriter perched on a chair in her almost empty apartment, she wrote a novel about the Californian rivers she so missed. Those waterways are the real lead in her first novel, Run River (1963). John Gregory Dunne, a staffer on Time magazine and also a self-declared outsider, edited it. They married in 1964, and moved to Los Angeles temporarily, sure that his older brother, the producer Dominick Dunne, would be their entree to screenwriting. That scenario did not quite play out, and both had to turn to magazine journalism for an income. Didion categorised some of her essays, with their first-person viewpoint and fiction-like fine detail, as “Personals”, but in fact they were about the world as seen by a social and political conservative from the last American generation to identify with adults. A tiny, unnerved and unnerving figure behind vast dark glasses, she was derisive of lax language and dismissive of unformed thought on both the left and right. She did not care to negotiate interviews with stars via their press agents. She believed she could pass unnoticed anywhere: among the residue of the Hollywood studios and the creatives of the new music business; in arid valley towns and LA’s dustier districts; around the coagulating hippy counterculture in San Francisco. Her descriptions of her crippling social anxiety, her inability to make a phone call to get an assignment under way, did not accord with others’ memories of her taking laps of the room at swelegant parties. Didion’s first book of collected journalism, Slouching Towards Bethlehem, published in 1968, the year in which she had a breakdown, established her reputation for cool and very slowly became a cult: as the writer Caitlin Flanagan remembered, Didion “had fans – not the way writers have fans, but the way musicians and actors have fans – and almost all of them were female”. That coolness was confirmed by her second novel, Play It As It Lays (1970), with its zomboid leading woman on Hollywood’s perimeter, so chilled a fiction that Didion’s editor, Henry Robbins, called her to ask if she was all right. Possibly not, but she was getting by. The next year the couple had their first script onscreen, The Panic in Needle Park, and then their 1972 adaptation of Play It As It Lays flopped. Didion’s literary identity became clearer than that of her husband, with whom she shared preoccupations and phrasing, which added edge to their joint 1976 refettling of A Star Is Born to Barbra Streisand’s specifications. Didion continued the essays, more personal yet, collected in 1979 as The White Album, and developed an idea she had had when trapped by paratyphoid in a hotel room during a Columbian film festival into A Book of Common Prayer (1977), her first fictional engagement with the role and image of the US in Central and Latin America. At that point all the elements were in play that recurred in her fact and fiction. There was her concentration on the Americas – she had visited Europe and Israel, but disclaimed interest in them – and on the Hispanic influx into the US, which, as a Californian, she was aware of very early. Her books of reportage, El Salvador (1982) - “One morning at the breakfast table I was reading the newspaper and it just didn’t make sense,” she wrote of US press coverage of Salvador’s internal war, and immediately flew there to inspect the body dumps – and Miami (1987), were descriptions of equal and opposite cultural misunderstandings. She felt that the US political process had become self-contained, exclusive of the electorate and, from the presidency of Ronald Reagan onwards, of reality itself – as depicted in the essays anthologised in After Henry (1992) and Political Fictions (2001) and her occasional 21st century pieces. This perception also fed into her best and most successful novel, Democracy (1984), which could be read as a romance, or – as was also true of her 1996 novel The Last Thing He Wanted – as an exploration of private connections to public power. The political could not have been made more personal. The greater constant in Didion’s work, though, was the intersection of public and private mood with place – Hawaii febrile in tropical rain, Los Angeles fractious as the Santa Ana winds blew through. Readers came to know the homes she had passed through – the Malibu beach premises on the edge of the fire season burn zone, the “house in a part of Hollywood that had once been expensive and was now described as a ‘senseless killing neighbourhood’”, the Manhattan apartment with the Cy Twombly artwork, plus a travel itinerary of grand hotels. They became even more familiar with the older California that she kept recalling all the way up to her memoir Where I Was From (2003), in which she finally admitted that her apprehension of her native state had been a misapprehension, an “enchantment under which I lived my life”. It was not the place she had thought it, and it never had been, all the way back to the settlers’ wagon trains and their encounters with rattlesnakes. By then, she seemed to feel that reality was dispelling all enchantments from her life. The lives of Didion and Dunne had been mostly funded by their remunerative rewrites for the screen, although their joint “implied promise of quality” had been delivered in the adaption of Dunne’s novel True Confessions (1981), and rather less so in a prolonged project, Up Close and Personal, filmed in 1996 as a vehicle for Robert Redford. They supported each other in public over their career compromises, but there had been fights and near-splits in the marriage. They once holidayed in the Royal Hawaian hotel “in lieu of filing for divorce”, and Dunne left to live alone in Vegas for a while when it was his turn for a breakdown. But it had survived, stronger than a mutual defence pact. Dunne died of a heart attack at their dinner table in Manhattan in 2003, a sudden exit that Didion described in The Year of Magical Thinking (2005), her book of grief and disbelief. It was critically admired for its honesty and clarity, and adapted for the stage. Didion delayed Dunne’s funeral until their daughter Quintana had recovered from the pneumonia and septic shock that had put her into hospital intensive care. But her recovery was brief and Quintana died just before the book’s publication. Didion and Dunne had adopted the baby on the day of her birth in 1966, and called her after a Mexican state. She became a familiar player in their pieces, often quoted, described as an insouciant user of hotel room service when accompanying her mother on book tours. In Blue Nights (2011), Didion suggested quite another story of Quintana as a Hollywood child who feared abandonment, was suicidal, diagnosed as manic depressive, and in adulthood had had difficult encounters with her birth family. However, the true subject of Blue Nights was Didion, alone and a long way from California; there could be no going back to places so changed. Her last works, South and West (2017) and Let Me Tell You What I Mean (2021) collected her “field notes” and early writing.

12/24/2021,"At least three arts organisations have pulled out of Sydney festival over a sponsorship deal with the Israeli embassy, amid calls for a boycott. The protests, backed by a coalition of Arab and pro-Palestinian organisations and assorted artists and academics, are over a $20,000 sponsorship deal to stage a production of the Israeli choreographer Ohad Naharin’s Decadance by the Sydney Dance Company.  So far, the South Asian dance company Bindi Bosses, the Arab Theatre Studio, the Bankstown poetry slam and comedian Nazeem Hussain have pulled out of the 2022 festival. According to a statement released on Wednesday by the Palestinian Justice Movement Sydney, the sponsorship deal was sealed in May, the same month Israeli armed forces launched a series of air attacks on Gaza, killing a number of Palestinian civilians. “Palestine advocates call on all opponents of apartheid to boycott the 2022 Sydney Festival,” the statement said. “By partnering with Israel, Sydney festival will … contribute to the normalisation of an apartheid state.” Read our media release: Palestine Justice Movement Sydney joins other Palestine solidarity-organisations in calling on audiences and performers to boycott @sydney_festival this January. We're also calling on festival directors to refuse complicity w Israeli apartheid & resign. pic.twitter.com/AquadkgjdY In an open letter published on the Meanjin website on Thursday, a coalition of artists and writers said that they considered the Sydney festival’s continued partnership with the Israeli embassy was “disgraceful” and accused the festival of “creating a culturally unsafe environment for Arab artists and audiences who want to be part of the festival but who now cannot, in good conscience, participate as they bear witness to the slaughter, occupation and oppression of Palestinians”. Naharin has stated on a number of occasions his support in principle for the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movements’s agenda on human rights for the Palestinian people. But, responding to request from Brian Eno to cease using his musical works in an Israeli embassy-sponsored Batsheva Dance Company production in Tel Aviv in 2016, the choreographer described such boycotts as “lazy” and “essentially useless”, adding he believed there were more effective ways of helping the Palestinian cause. In a statement provided to Guardian Australia on Thursday, a festival spokesperson said it would not be terminating its agreement with the Israeli embassy. “The festival is unwavering in its commitment to ensuring a culturally safe space for all artists, employees and audiences,” the statement said. “[The festival] will be reviewing all funding arrangements with embassies and cultural organisations to ensure that any continuance of these partnerships are compatible with maintaining a welcoming and culturally safe environment moving forward.” In an earlier statement this week, the Sydney festival board said it was unable to support the BDS movement as requested by the coalition (which includes the Arab Australian Federation, Greens for Palestine, Independent Australian Jewish Voices, Jews against the Occupation Sydney, the Sydney representative for BDS and United Australian Palestinian Workers) because the festival was a nonprofit, non-political organisation. One of the co-authors of the Meanjin letter is writer Michael Mohammed Ahmad, who was due to join the festival board later this year and has now rejected the appointment. The open letter described the festival’s position as “a hollow claim given the Festival is politically aware enough to platform First Nations and ‘minority’ or ‘diverse artists’. “How is it that the festival can reconcile its commitment to Indigenous solidarity here while legitimising and normalising relations with a settler colonial apartheid state that maintains a system of racism, subjugation and land theft against Palestinians?” the letter asked. This is so incredibly disappointing. The arts, particularly for marginalised peoples are (for the most part), our political platforms. For an arts festival to claim they are apolitical is embarrassing to say the very least. Writer and academic Anita Heiss tweeted: “For an arts festival to claim they are apolitical is embarrassing to say the very least.” A statement from the Israel embassy in Canberra sent to the Guardian on Thursday said: “Israel has always and will continue to promote cultural exchange and engage in cultural dialogue in numerous countries including Australia. “Culture is a bridge to coexistence, cooperation and rapprochement and should be left out of the political arena.” Earlier this year the Melbourne Queer film festival faced a similar backlash for screening an Israeli state-funded film.",Arts/Culture,Arts organisations pull out of Sydney festival in protest at Israeli embassy sponsorship,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/dec/24/arts-organisations-pull-out-sydney-festival-protest-israeli-embassy-sponsorship
12/24/2021,"Everyone has a favourite ghost in Ghosts. Mine, in direct opposition to my feelings in the bloodless world of the living, is Julian. Simon Farnaby’s Teflon-coated sleazy Tory (distinguishing feature: no trousers) died mid-shag with an MP called Lindsay during a 90s fundraiser. He is such a blowhard that he is the only ghost in Britain’s friendliest haunted house who can move things – if he concentrates really hard and makes a ridiculous amount of noise. With his pants down. Anyway, Julian is on top form in the Christmas special (BBC One), which is as much of a hot-water bottle for the heart as you would expect it to be. He rails against the rough sleeper who has pitched his tent on Button Hall’s land: “I don’t want to sound all not-in-my-back-yard, but you really don’t want one in your own back yard.” Then he does a U-turn. Which, of course, is really a lie: “I’m no liberal, but ejecting a vagrant at Christmas? I would never, ever stoop so low!”  Most yuletidey of all, Julian teaches the other ghosts how to lie. Who knew that nothing would get me more in the mood for Christmas 2021 than a gentle, family-friendly, completely on-the-nose jibe about dissembling Tories? “There is nothing that can’t be lied about,” he brags, smashing his knuckles into his palm. “Or rather, there is no truth that cannot be avoided.” When lying, Julian concludes, it is best to answer a question with another question. “Does that actually work?” asks Pat whose questions tend more towards the annual Christmas quiz. “Do you want it to work?” Julian bats back. “See!” This is everything you want from a Christmas special. It is funny, festive and features Jennifer Saunders channelling Mrs Bennet as Lady Fanny’s overbearing mother, which is without a shadow of a doubt the most sparkly sentence I have written this season. It is also perfect casting; Martha Howe-Douglas’s Fanny, with her chin-wattling expressions and overstated grandeur, is clearly modelled on vintage French and Saunders sketches. Ghosts, which rose like the dead from Horrible Histories, has always done a fine line in backstories and this one is a doozy. Fanny, it turns out, was a young mathematical genius (check out her yorkshire pudding long division if you don’t believe me) who desperately wanted to help her father escape penury. But her Edwardian mother – Saunders – was more interested in keeping up appearances and marrying her off to the next rich sod. When their house was repossessed at Christmas, Fanny was forced to marry the wayward son of rich cousins the Buttons to save them from the streets. We know how that one turned out, what with her being thrown out of the window by her gay husband and all. My only criticism of this tragic tale? The missed opportunity. Dawn French would have been the perfect bailiff. The old-fashioned – indeed, Christian – message entwined through it all like tinsel is about helping those less fortunate than ourselves. Everyone reacts to the homeless man differently. Alison wants him to stay and microwaves him a cottage pie (which he gives to his dog because “I lost my house, not my tastebuds”). Mike fears he will ruin their “quiet Cooper Christmas” and toys with calling the police. Then we learn his backstory. He is ex-navy (“civilians with fancy hats!” exclaims the Captain), his name is Nicholas, he makes a mean haricot bean stew, he has a dog called Rudy and he wears a red beanie. No wonder Kitty, who is basically festive spirit in the spectral form of a Georgian noble, thinks he is Father Christmas. All she wants for Christmas is a tiny, singing-and-dancing Santa with a saxophone reduced online from £14.99 to £11.24. It is in such pathetic details that Ghosts scales the heady – or should I say headless? – heights. Ghosts is like the best roast potatoes – soft on the inside and Christmassy all year round. Partly, it is the subject matter: ghosts have been festive since Dickens sent one to sort out Ebenezer Scrooge. But it is also the feelings this classic British sitcom – and how many of those do we have at the moment? – induces. Three gloriously silly series in, Ghosts remains hilarious, erudite and sweet, with a gag ratio so high, and of such consistently high quality, that even a joke about lying politicians can make you feel all warm, fuzzy and – sorry, there is no other word for it – irreparably British inside. Yes, I experience curious and long-latent feelings of pride when I watch Ghosts. Indeed, Button Hall may be among the last safe spaces in this country where it is OK to resurrect long-dead feelings of nostalgia (even if it is plagued by ghosts who never shut up).
