3/14/2022,"There are significant gaps in Michael Gove’s refugee scheme that could exclude vulnerable people from coming to the UK and increase the chance of homelessness for those who do, humanitarian experts have said. The Homes for Ukraine programme, unveiled by the communities secretary over the weekend and to be rolled out this week, will allow individuals, charities, community groups and businesses to bring people escaping the war to safety. Sponsored Ukrainians will be granted three years’ leave to remain in the UK, with entitlement to work and access public services. However, concerns have been raised that Ukrainians will still need to apply for a visa to qualify for the programme, which charities have argued is a major barrier for many. In addition, the Guardian understands refugees will not be able to apply for housing benefit as part of a universal credit claim, exposing them to a risk of homelessness if their accommodation with family members or sponsors breaks down. The first ministers of Scotland and Wales are reportedly seeking to become “super sponsors” so they can go beyond the measures announced by Gove. Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said it was important to harness the generosity and goodwill of the public but the programme had to have the right resources. He said: “Supporting people to host Ukrainian refugees should be part of the UK’s offer. But if it’s going to work, it needs to be delivered with all the right resource and all the necessary entitlements for Ukrainians – so they’re able to get all the healthcare they need, access housing benefit – because the reality is, the sponsor arrangement will be a short-term measure. “This conflict doesn’t look like it’s going to end quickly, there needs to be a clear pathway to longer-term accommodations.” Every EU country has waived visa requirements for Ukrainians in the short term but the UK government is insisting visas will be necessary, despite pressure to drop the policy. Solomon said a visa programme was “effectively a managed migration route, which is not suitable to use to respond to a humanitarian crisis”. The route is complicated further if a refugee does not have a Ukrainian passport, as there are additional requirements including providing biometric data to a processing centre. For vulnerable people including unaccompanied children, this would be a significant barrier, Solomon said. The Guardian understands that Ukrainian refugees arriving under the programme will not be able to apply for housing benefit, which enables an individual to pay for private rent. This is out of step with regular refugee status in the UK following the asylum process – there are no restrictions placed on work or claiming benefits. There is yet to be any additional funding announced for healthcare services, as there was when Afghanistan fell to the Taliban and the UK took in fleeing Afghans, Solomon said. Louise Calvey, the head of services and safeguarding at Refugee Action, said: “The public outpouring of compassion for Ukrainian refugees in this country has been incredible. However, this does not give the government licence to outsource its responsibilities to protect refugees. “Instead of developing a fully funded and comprehensive refugee resettlement scheme, the government is leaving the British public to pick up the pieces of a refugee protection system it has been tearing apart.” She continued: “Refugee sponsorship is a wonderful way for people to show their support but they cannot be a country’s main response to large-scale displacement. Sponsorship is slow, bureaucratic and selective and takes an average of just 150 refugees each year. “We are also deeply concerned about the risks to the safety of refugees that are inherent in the proposed scheme. Many people fleeing Ukraine will be traumatised and require specialist support, and some will be vulnerable to exploitation. This inadequate refugee protection programme comes after more than two weeks of government dither and delay.” A Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities source said they believed they would be able to get the scheme going very quickly, without bureaucratic barriers. They said it was correct that a visa would still be required, and the department had to balance bringing as many people as possible with conducting checks to protect the security of the country. Unconfirmed reports have suggested intelligence and security services have raised concerns about terrorists and organised criminals taking advantage of relaxed routes to the UK from Ukraine. Micheál Martin, Ireland’s taoiseach, told BBC’s Sunday Morning programme the “humanitarian response trumps anything, as far as we’re concerned. But our security people will keep on monitoring the situation in terms of what’s on.”",News/UK news,Refugee groups criticise gaps in UK’s Ukraine response,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/13/refugee-groups-criticise-gaps-in-uks-ukraine-response
3/14/2022,"In other news, Kai Havertz scored a stunning last-minute winner to give Chelsea a fifth Premier League win on the spin and hand Newcastle a first defeat in 10 games in the competition. It was a day when the action on the field felt strangely incidental, as Chelsea played at Stamford Bridge for the first time since the fall of their oligarch owner, Roman Abramovich, in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Facing them were opponents who are owned by the Public Investment Fund of a country that is involved in the war with Yemen. Outgoing Russian money versus incoming Saudi Arabian money, with ethical questions everywhere. It was one to warm the hearts of the romantics. It is fair to say that plenty has happened at Chelsea since their last game here – the Champions League last 16, first-leg win over Lille on 22 February. Abramovich has been identified by the UK government as an enabler of the Vladimir Putin regime and he has been stripped of his assets over here, including Chelsea, which he must now sell. And with a degree of speed, if the stinging sanctions that are in place against the club are not to drag them under. The match-going Chelsea support tried to process it all. Should they proclaim their affection for Abramovich? To some of them, it remains possible to continue to celebrate him for all that he has done for their club and condemn his nation’s senseless war on Ukraine. The banner was still up inside the ground – the one that says “Roman Empire” and has an image of him – but there was only one chant of Abramovich’s name that stood out in the 66th minute and that was quickly superseded by another for the manager, Thomas Tuchel, who really is the man in these parts. It was edgy and uncomfortable, Chelsea labouring for pretty much the whole afternoon. And yet Havertz would provide the sting, bringing Newcastle to their knees when he took a sublime touch to control Jorginho’s ball over the top before steering home in the same elegant movement. Havertz could very well have been sent off for an elbow on Dan Burn towards the end of the first half. Now, he was the hero and he might have had a second in stoppage time only to be denied by the crossbar. When the goal went in, Tuchel tore off on an ecstatic run along the touchline, the pent-up emotions pouring out and, briefly, everybody could forget about what a weird occasion this had been. The trappings had been everywhere. The Chelsea club shop remained closed, allowing the street hawkers to enjoy a brisk trade because their earning will not find a way back to Abramovich while the old-fashioned sign for the next home game against Brentford declared that tickets were not available. It had been subdued, to say the least, leading up kick-off, even if the travelling Newcastle support was typically vocal, and Chelsea’s entrance to The Liquidator - their long-established pre-match tune – invited wry observations. César Azpilicueta, the Chelsea captain, began his programme notes with a message of support for the Ukrainian people, although the vast majority of the fans in attendance could not read them; the programme was available only in the media and hospitality suites and was not on general sale. Tuchel’s switch to a back four, with the centre-halves, Trevoh Chalobah and Malang Sarr in the full-back positions, was probably not the big news it might have been but, as the manager, had stressed, Chelsea needed to narrow the focus and find a way to get their jobs done on the pitch. Tuchel has been hugely impressive in his public utterances, refusing to duck the difficult questions about the wider issues, to say what has needed to be said. Perhaps, there was an element of liberation for him during the 90 minutes, when he could embrace the simple pleasures such as losing the plot with the fourth official or the Newcastle assistant manager, Jason Tindall. It was a nothing kind of first half, the most notable incident coming on 39 minutes when Havertz, who played at the tip of Chelsea’s 4-1-4-1 formation, led with his elbow into an aerial challenge on Burn and cleaned out the towering Newcastle centre-half. It could easily have added up to a red card; Havertz would get away with yellow. Burn was understandably angry and, while he received treatment on the ground, he seemed to slap Havertz on the ankle as the Chelsea player walked past. Once Burn was vertical, he went after Havertz, which attracted the interest of Antonio Rüdiger. Burn would be booed by the home crowd. Of course, he was. Chelsea had continued to wear the branding of Three and Hyundai on their shirts, even though both sponsors have withdrawn their support. Apparently, the club worried that they could not pay for blank shirts from their kit supplier, Nike, and efforts to remove the logos from the existing tops did not work. All pretty surreal. Newcastle were the better team before the interval, pressing effectively, at times. Burn flicked a header past the far post from a Matt Targett cross on 35 minutes – Chris Wood could not stretch to apply a touch as the ball flashed in front of him – while Miguel Almirón worked Édouard Mendy with a banging volley in stoppage time. The travelling fans provided the note of humour. “Mike Ashley, he’s coming for you,” they chanted, introducing their own former owner to the mix – an extremely unloved one, in this case. “He left cos your shit,” retorted the home crowd. Newcastle shouted loudly for a penalty on 58 minutes when Jacob Murphy went down under Chalobah’s challenge, albeit a little too easily while it did not look as though it would be Chelsea’s day when Timo Werner took a heavy touch when well-placed and Havertz headed at Martin Dubravka from a Hakim Ziyech cross.",Sport/Football,Kai Havertz strikes late to give turbulent Chelsea victory over Newcastle,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/13/chelsea-newcastle-premier-league-match-report

3/14/2022,"Andriy Yarmolenko sank to his knees, arms out, less in celebration it seemed than in exhaustion. His teammates surrounded him, their reaction less of joy than of something more profound. When the Ukrainian got to his feet, his mouth was tight as he tried to fight back the tears. In the end he could not, and as he walked back to his own half to restart the game, he wept openly. Even Aston Villa’s players applauded. Football can be a horrible game, its ownership model perhaps broken beyond repair, but there are still times when it can provide moments of enormous poignancy and perhaps more. “Goal for West Ham and Ukraine,” boomed the stadium announcer, “Andriy Yarmolenko.” Was that overdoing it? Perhaps. But the bombast matched the mood. This was a goal that set West Ham on the way to their second win in seven games and that kept them dreaming of Champions League qualification. But it felt a lot more important than that. What, by the end of the season, will probably appear a mid-table clash is nothing but an irrelevance in the wider context, but perhaps somewhere, in some bunker in Mariupol, a shattered apartment block in Kyiv, or in Yarmolenko’s home city of Chernihiv in the north of Ukraine, somebody will hear that Yarmolenko scored and be transported, at least momentarily, from the horror. Perhaps they will hear of the roar that greeted Yarmolenko’s arrival as a 52nd-minute substitute for Michail Antonio, or of the scenes that followed his goal, and know that their plight is remembered, that the sympathy of a large part of the world is with them. It is only a symbol, but it is something. West Ham have seemed weary recently as they went out of the FA Cup to Southampton and lost the first leg of their Europa League tie against Sevilla. Antonio, in particular, has looked short of his usual zip. This was his 27th league start of the season, but he had not scored in the league since New Year’s Day. West Ham have a longstanding habit of wasting money on centre-forwards but the failure to bring in support for him in January may be what ends up costing them Champions League football next season. There was one dart from the Jamaica striker after 33 minutes that brought a corner, but his involvement was spasmodic even before he went down with what appeared to be a groin problem. This was a game littered with injuries. Villa’s Lucas Digne hobbled off after 10 minutes and Aaron Cresswell followed Antonio. With Jarrod Bowen also out, West Ham are running short of attacking options. Yarmolenko may have a major role to play in the coming weeks. He took his goal well, seizing on Saïd Benrahma’s pass before deftly clipping his shot past Emi Martínez with the outside of his foot with 20 minutes remaining. Benrahma laid on the second for Pablo Fornals to cap a neat counter 12 minutes later. What was odd was how Villa, despite having won their previous three games, seemed happy to let the game drift. There were moments of low-key time-wasting and a lot of sideways passes. For a long time this was a flat affair, although it did liven up around the hour mark as Danny Ings had a shot pushed against the post and then Craig Dawson headed over the bar from close range after Martínez had made a remarkable block from a Kurt Zouma header. West Ham reached the quarter-finals of both the FA Cup and the League Cup this season and are in the last 16 of the Europa League. If fatigue is beginning to take its toll, it’s perhaps no great surprise. Just because West Ham won, nobody should think that issue has gone away. This was a tired performance, and the suspicion was that if Villa had gone at West Ham earlier, as they belatedly did having fallen behind, they might have caused them problems. As it was, Jacob Ramsey’s 90th-minute goal was enough only to cause West Ham an anxious six minutes of injury time. The three points may prove important come the end of the season, but really what mattered was far less the result or any specifics than the warmth that was shown to Yarmolenko. As the rockets fall on Ukraine it is next to nothing, a gesture of almost incalculable meagreness, but it is what football can do. If that provides succour to anybody, then it is worth something.",Sport/Football,Andriy Yarmolenko’s tears eclipse West Ham’s win against Aston Villa,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/13/west-ham-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report
3/14/2022,"A game that started with Watford’s supporters deriding their team’s chances of starting next season in the Premier League ended with them revelling in victory and clinging on to hope of an unlikely escape. Roy Hodgson earned his second win in charge to hoist Watford level on points with Everton, who remain outside of the relegation zone on goal difference. The obvious caveat is that teams above and below them are armed with games in hand but on this evidence Watford’s race is not yet run. Cucho Hernández scored twice as Southampton suffered a third straight defeat, with Mohamed Elyounoussi’s strike before half-time failing to ignite a fightback. Southampton began with great promise, Elyounoussi’s header cleared off the line by Samir with less than 90 seconds gone, but it did not last and Jan Bednarek’s desperate block to prevent João Pedro lashing a shot goalwards was a sign of things to come, even if the bulk of the travelling supporters seemed happy to make light of Watford’s shortcomings this season with a series of sarcastic chants. It seemed apt that Hernández would open the scoring seconds after the away fans launched into a carousel of ‘Oles’ after stringing a few passes together. But Watford did not have to do too much to take the lead. Mohammed Salisu appeared uncomfortable after reluctantly accepting an awkward ball from his centre-back partner, Bednarek, and undercooked a back pass for Fraser Forster, who seemed to freeze in time, and a lurking Hernández nipped in to round the Southampton goalkeeper and coolly finish from an acute angle. The Watford supporters who were bathing in the low sun went ballistic, but that did not stop them singing that they would be playing in the Championship next season. Watford played with a low block, with every outfield player behind the ball as Southampton huffed and puffed on halfway. The home supporters made their frustration clear and Ralph Hasenhüttl contorted as Salisu played an aimless pass upfield. Kyle Walker-Peters thrashed a shot at Ben Foster from the byline and Salisu headed over an inviting James Ward-Prowse free-kick but Watford hushed the hosts when they doubled their advantage on 34 minutes. Hasenhüttl, hands on hips on the edge of the technical area, appeared as stunned as the travelling Watford supporters. Hodgson, by contrast, was unmoved in the dugout. Watford piled down the left and Juraj Kucka’s delicious first-time cross dropped at the back post, where the unmarked Hernández smacked in his second. It could have been 3-0 a few minutes later had Kucka taken Moussa Sissoko’s pass in his stride. “Can we play you every week?” came the riposte from the away fans, having seen their team score two goals on the road for only the second time this season. Watford were in unusual territory and any hopes of a clean sheet were broken on the brink of half-time. Elyounoussi set up an intriguing second half after arriving at the back post to convert another Ward-Prowse free-kick. Che Adams flicked the ball on and Elyounoussi kept his cool to apply the finish. Foster tipped over from Adams with a minute of normal time to play but Watford eked out a priceless win.",Sport/Football,Cucho Hernández at the double to give Watford vital win at Southampton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/13/southampton-watford-premier-league-match-report
3/14/2022,"Stoppage time had begun and Jesse Marsch was looking increasingly anxious when the 19-year-old Joe Gelhardt replaced Mateusz Klich. It would prove a highly inspired substitution on the Leeds manager’s part as, by the time the final whistle blew, Gelhardt had quite possibly changed the course of the entire race against relegation. As the substitute lashed Raphinha’s delivery beyond Tim Krul in Norwich’s goal and the entire home bench raced down the touchline to envelop him in hugs of utmost relief, Leeds fans celebrated not only Marsch’s first win, and points, in three games since succeeding Marcelo Bielsa but the end of a run of six straight defeats that had carried their team to the brink of the bottom three. It is perhaps no coincidence that their first win in nine games – a result that does nothing for Norwich’s already slim hopes of avoiding relegation – coincided with Patrick Bamford’s first start since the striker suffered an ankle injury in September. Although Bamford looked a little ring rusty his first-half movement unnerved Norwich and Dean Smith’s side only came into things a little after Bamford was withdrawn at half-time. Although by the end of an ultimately bad tempered game they had lost control and concentration Leeds began “Marsching on Together” in the 13th minute. Diego Llorente aimed a long ball in Bamford’s direction and, although Ozan Kabak diverted it with his head it fell into the path of the influential Daniel James, who controlled it on his chest. Norwich expected James to cross to the heavily marked Bamford but, instead, he laid off for Rodrigo to unleash a half-volley which, courtesy of a deflection off Ben Gibson, flew into the bottom corner. It prompted wild home celebrations involving almost the entire Leeds team and backroom staff, with Marsch at one point crossing on to the pitch in order to embrace Rodrigo. Dean Smith and his staff were simultaneously steaming with rage after spotting that Bamford had been well offside when Llorente made his delivery. Bamford, though, was not interfering with play and the first Leeds goal of Marsch’s tenure stood. From then on his side were very much in the ascendancy with the reassuringly revitalised Raphinha unfortunate to see a first time volley rebound off the crossbar after connecting with Bamford’s cross. Luke Ayling survived a VAR review for a potential red card after the referee, Stuart Attwell, booked him for catching Milot Rashica on an ankle with his studs but Norwich could count themselves fortunate to be merely a single goal down at the break after Raphinha’s ball left Bamford onside with only Krul to beat. Smith’s goalkeeper kept his cool, advancing off his line and restricting Bamford’s shooting options by making himself big and narrowing the angles. As the striker side-footed wide, a groin of disbelief echoed around Elland Road. With James’s rapid change of pace and willingness to run at Smith’s defence persistently destabilising Norwich, Adam Forshaw and Mateusz Klich doing a decent job of holding the home midfield together and Pascal Struijk spurning a fairly routine chance, Marsch’s side could easily have been three up at that point. The second half had barely begun before James had a “goal” disallowed for offside but, no longer worried about Bamford’s movement, Norwich had improved slightly, prompting Marsch to replace Rodrigo with the more defensively minded Robin Koch. That switch seemed to galvanise Leeds and it took a flying save from Krul to keep James’s curving shot out as, unusually, Illan Meslier found himself reduced to little more than a spectating role. Indeed the recently overworked home goalkeeper was probably relieved to be able to keep his hand in by saving a shot from Norwich substitute Jonathan Rowe. By now the visitors were becoming seriously frustrated, with Max Aarons’s decision to engage Bamford’s replacement Jack Harrison in a running feud emblematic of their fragile collective mindset. This mood was worsened appreciably after a VAR review denied them a penalty initially awarded but Attwell in the wake of Ayling’s sliding penalty area challenge on Rashica. As the refefee consulted his pitchside monitor, both sets of players gathered to argue about the incident with Krul leaving his goal to play an apparently active part in a debate sparked by Aarons. Eventually Attwell agreed it was not a penalty, Aarons was booked and the action resumed with Leeds vindicated in their view that Rashica had deliberately fallen over Ayling’s outstretched leg. Shortly after Raphinha’s free-kick had struck the crossbar, Smith sensibly replaced Aarons with Billy Gilmour and suddenly it was Leeds who had lost their heads. They paid the price when Kenny McLean met an incisive cross from the previously peripheral Teemu Pukki and shot what seemed an a late, and unlikely, equaliser. Gelhardt had other ideas. After stepping off the bench in the 90th minute the teenager headed into Raphinha’s path and watched the Brazilian round Krul before redirecting the return into the empty net from close range.",Sport/Football,Gelhardt gives Marsch first Leeds win in dramatic finale against Norwich,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/13/leeds-norwich-premier-league-match-report
3/14/2022,"For someone who succeeded to a baronetcy in 1971, the actor Jeremy Child, who has died aged 77 after a long period of ill health, was something of a rebel. In his last stage appearance in the West End he appeared as a psychoanalyst morphing into a Jewish leprechaun in Ying Tong (2004), a play about the Goons and Spike Milligan’s depression. Choosing the theatre over an expected career path of the Guards and the Foreign Office, he started his career in regional repertory companies and a couple of early 1970s plays at the Royal Court in London – Crete and Sergeant Pepper by John Antrobus, a surreal comedy about war prisoners in the Mediterranean (1972) and A Fart for Europe by David Edgar and Howard Brenton, which opposed Britain’s entry to the Common Market (1973). In the former play, as a military policeman, he exploited his natural gifts of patrician haughtiness allied to strikingly good bearing and looks – he was tall, blond, lithe – and an innate sense of mischievous fun. He was known among his friends as “Jo” – shorthand for jovial. One of his most distinctive performances, also in 1973, came as George Bernard Shaw’s comic aviator in Misalliance, at the Mermaid. Accompanied by a Polish acrobat, he crashed through an Edwardian country house conservatory to join a debate on marriage and socialism in Alan Strachan’s production, led by Bill Fraser and Caroline Blakiston. All the same, Child’s background fed a stage and screen career full of lawyers, politicians, business executives and diplomats. He played three foreign secretaries on television – the fictional Charles Seymour in Jeffrey Archer’s First Among Equals (1986), Sir Samuel Hoare in Bertie and Elizabeth (2002), an account of the marriage of George VI and Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, and Francis Pym, Margaret Thatcher’s foreign secretary, in The Falklands Play (2002) by Ian Curteis. Child was born in Woking, Surrey, to Sir Coles John Child, the second baronet, a diplomat with the Foreign Office, and his wife, Sheila (nee Mathewson). After his education at Eton, Aiglon college in Switzerland and a year’s stint at the University of Poitiers in France, he worked briefly in the City as a reluctant broker before training at the Bristol Old Vic theatre school. In 1965 he made his professional debut at the Bristol Old Vic in a revival of Lock Up Your Daughters by Lionel Bart and Laurie Johnson, moving on to rep in Windsor, Canterbury and Colchester. His West End debut was in Barry England’s Conduct Unbecoming at the Queen’s (now Sondheim), taking over in 1970 in the second cast of a big hit about a scandal engulfing a British regiment in India in the 1880s. By now he was compiling an impressive CV in dissident British movies as an “establishment” bulwark: in Peter Watkins’s prophetic film Privilege (1967) he was the manipulative manager of a pop singer (Paul Jones) moving into celebrity religious guru status. And he joined a notably pukka cast – Richard Warwick, Edward Fox, Timothy Carlton (Benedict Cumberbatch’s father) and Joanna Lumley, a lifelong friend – in Andrew Sinclair’s The Breaking of Bumbo (1970), a film that never won a general release in the UK. After a delightful cameo as a titled bootlegger in the Gershwins’ Oh, Kay!, starring Amanda Barrie at the Westminster in 1974, he took over as one of the old college reunion boys in Michael Frayn’s Donkeys’ Years at the Globe (now the Gielgud) in 1977 and enhanced a 1980 revival of Noël Coward’s Hay Fever at the Lyric Hammersmith. On film, he reverted to rectitude and type, perhaps, as a divorce lawyer in The Stud (1978), starring Joan Collins and Oliver Tobias; as a well-bred music industry agency man in Franc Roddam’s mods-and-rockers classic Quadrophenia (1979); and as an astonished family man walking in on a naked John Cleese in the deliriously funny A Fish Called Wanda (1988). Theatre work in the 90s encompassed Alan Bennett’s The Madness of King George III at the National Theatre (as Dr Richard Warren; he was Black Rod in the subsequent movie); Joe Orton’s What the Butler Saw at the Salisbury Playhouse, as the eminent and beleaguered Dr Prentice, “a particularly unpleasant urchin posing as a sleazy clubman,” said the Sunday Times; and a senior diplomat in a fine revival of David Hare’s Plenty, starring a coltish, fiery Cate Blanchett directed by Jonathan Kent for the Almeida in the West End. His later work included an outstanding performance as Leo Amery in Ronald Harwood’s An English Tragedy (2008), a tale of tangled sexual and political affiliations, at the Watford Palace; a tour in 2009 of Frayn’s Balmoral, in which, as Warwick Deeping, he joined a confederacy of British writers – others were Enid Blyton and Godfrey Winn – in an inverted satire on the Russian revolution; and, at last, an upright and dignified hereditary earl and minister, Lord Stanhope, in Joe Wright’s film Darkest Hour (2017), starring Gary Oldman as Winston Churchill. Child – who never used his full name or title – was married three times: to the actor Deborah Grant, from 1971 to 1976, and the dancer Jan Todd , from 1978 to 1986, his first two marriages ending in divorce; and the publisher Elizabeth Morgan from 1987 until her death in 2019. With her, he settled in the village of Benson, Oxfordshire, where he enjoyed the friendship of the neighbouring actors Simon Williams and Patrick Ryecart and their families. He is survived by five children – Melissa from his first marriage; Alexander and Leonora from his second; and Patrick and Eliza from his third, and by seven grandchildren.

3/14/2022,"Only Ryan Giggs has won more Premier League games as a player than Frank Lampard but one of the division’s royalty is threatened with ejection from the ranks of the elite. Everton’s position grows ever more precarious. They were imperilled both by a fourth consecutive league defeat and by results elsewhere. Others may yet save them, but Everton showed precious little ability to save themselves. They may have been relying on Goodison Park to provide salvation but a rare Merseysider present to enjoy their latest setback was the man who condemned them to defeat: Conor Coady, a former Liverpool player and lifelong fan. He enabled his side to leapfrog Tottenham, complete a first double over Everton since 1973 and provide another endorsement of Bruno Lage’s low-profile, high-quality regime. Everton were combative in the first half but rather more shambolic in the second. They were reduced to 10 men when Jonjoe Kenny collected two cautions in the space of four minutes and ended up being outclassed by Rúben Neves. If they are not alone in that, Wolves’ eventual dominance boded badly for their victims. Founder members of the Football League might not be meeting in the Premier League next season. “Going down,” came the taunt from the vocal visitors and, as Everton have only two wins in their last 20 league games, they might be right. They have not scored in the last four whereas Wolves have an unexpectedly potent force. Coady, who failed even to register a shot on target in his first 87 Premier League games, has doubled his tally of Wolves goals this season. His third was a wonderful header, curling away from Jordan Pickford, from Neves’s wonderful cross, bent in with mastery as vice-captain and captain combined to give Wolves the lead. It allowed Wolves to display their superiority. Raúl Jiménez volleyed past one post, Daniel Podence drilled a shot past the other. Neves is known more for his passing than his dribbling but he embarked on a 40-yard solo run before Fernando Marçal had a shot saved. When Kenny made his premature exit, Lampard’s plans were in ruins. They have been subject to regular rethinks. He had shown a ruthless streak as Everton began without the spine of the side that were embarrassed at Tottenham. Dominic Calvert-Lewin was ill but Allan and Michael Keane were unceremoniously dropped as Lampard reacted to the humiliation at Tottenham by switching to 3-4-3. A winning formula remains elusive but Everton at least looked more dynamic with Richarlison leading the line instead of a labouring Calvert-Lewin. The Brazilian burst beyond the Wolves defence to latch on to a pass from the recalled Vitalii Mykolenko. José Sá parried Richarlison’s shot but it was not the last time a roving runner at least showed the slipperiness to escape the attentions of three centre-backs. He mounted a one-man attempt to rescue a point, glancing the post with a header when offside and bending a shot into the side netting. Yet, with the exception of a spectacular if wayward overhead kick by Jiménez, his early shot was the first half’s only notable shot. If the opening period is recalled it may be for the three stoppages in swift succession when Hwang Hee-chan went down injured, eventually necessitating his withdrawal and irritating the home faithful. An apologetic wave to the Gwladys Street End was not enough to spare him boos. When his replacement Podence collapsed in histrionic fashion in a seeming attempt to get Pickford sent off, it appeared as though Wolves were trying to aggravate their way to a result. Instead, they settled for outplaying Everton.",Sport/Football,Conor Coady heads Wolves to victory and deepens Everton’s drop worries,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/13/everton-wolves-premier-league-match-report
3/14/2022,"The Ukrainian government is to launch a non-fungible token marking the history of the Russian invasion with unique digital art, in its latest use of digital assets to fund its war efforts. The country’s deputy minister of digital transformation, Alex Bornyakov, said the NFT collection would be “like a museum of the Russian-Ukrainian war. We want to tell the world in NFT format.” NFTs confer ownership of a unique digital item – with pieces of virtual art proving particularly popular – upon their buyer, even if that item can be easily copied. Bornyakov said each token would carry a piece of art representing a story from a trusted news source. He said: “We want it to be cool, good-looking, and it takes time.” The NFT collection is being prepared as a Ukrainian government appeal for cryptocurrency donations passed $60m (£46m), with donations including a CryptoPunk NFT worth more than $200,000. Bornyakov said the money was being used to buy military equipment and to fund media activities. He said: “We don’t use this fund to buy weapons at this point. We’re buying night vision goggles, optics, helmets, bulletproof vests.” Crypto assets proved extremely helpful in facilitation of funding flows to the Amed Forces of Ukraine. Huge thanks to everyone who donated to the Crypto Fund of Ukraine.Each and every helmet and vest bought via crypto donations is currently saving Ukrainian soilders' lives. pic.twitter.com/CghDmXEcJG Bornyakov added that Ukraine’s “digital diplomacy” had brought results, with social media platforms either blocking Russian state media content like Russia Today and Sputnik or labelling it. “We convinced social media platforms, international companies, to either block Russia, go out from Russia or completely change their information policy,” he said. Referring to social media as one of the Kremlin’s weapons in the conflict, Bornyakov said last week: “Most of their weapons are disabled. At this point, after two weeks. So this is what I’m calling positive results.” Bornyakov said a volunteer army of IT specialists, which is running on a channel on the Telegram messaging app, was reminding the Kremlin of how a steady stream of cyber-attacks in recent years had made “our lives horrible”. Hackers, some under the banner of the Anonymous collective, have staged a series of distributed denial of service attacks against Russian targets, disabling state-backed websites such as Russia Today’s by bombarding them with traffic. He said: “We just want to make them feel like we feel. Their [digital] war didn’t start 14 days ago. It started eight years ago, and they were constantly instantly attacking us with DDoS attacks, defacing websites or stealing our databases.” On Friday Russia moved to block Instagram after its parent company, Meta, said it would allow calls for violence against Vladimir Putin and Russian soldiers involved in the invasion of Ukraine to appear on its social media platforms. Russia’s general prosecutor’s office said it had moved to recognise Meta as an “extremist organisation and ban its activities on the territory of Russia”. It is not yet clear whether Meta’s WhatsApp messaging service, which is highly popular in Russia, will also be banned. Facebook, Meta’s main platform, is already blocked in Russia.",News/World news,Ukraine to launch NFT to mark history of the Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/13/ukraine-nft-history-of-russian-invasion-war
3/14/2022,"France will lift most of its Covid restrictions on Monday, scrapping Emmanuel Macron’s flagship vaccine pass and ending compulsory indoor mask-wearing in schools and many public spaces, as the government vows to ease pressure on French people’s daily lives despite a rise in infections. Less than month before April’s presidential vote – with polls showing the centrist Macron is favourite to win re-election – the government has brought forward its promise to ease restrictions before the summer. From Monday, schoolchildren aged six and over will not have to wear masks inside classrooms for the first time since September 2020. Masks will no longer be mandatory in shops, public services or work-places. But masks will remain compulsory on all public transport in France as well as at hospitals and for those visiting elderly people in care-homes. The French prime minister, Jean Castex, conceded in an interview this weekend that there had been an upturn in cases “like everywhere in Europe”, but he said pressure on French hospital emergency wards was going down and the BA2 variant of Omicron was more contagious but “seemingly less dangerous”. Castex said that while the government continued its strategy of easing restrictions, he “strongly recommended people who are vulnerable because of their age or pathologies to keep wearing masks in indoor spaces”. The end of the vaccine pass means that for the first time since last summer, French people no longer need to show a QR code to eat out in a restaurant, go to a café, workout at the gym, board a long-distance train, go to the cinema or borrow a library book. Macron first introduced a “health pass” in July 2021, making it compulsory to have proof of either vaccination, recovery from Covid or a negative test to enter places such as museums, restaurants and bars. Although the pass was controversial and led to some street protests, it had the support of the majority of the public in polls and pushed up vaccination levels: more than a million people made a vaccine appointment in the 24 hours after Macron’s announced the first health pass last summer. In January, Macron hardened the health pass by turning it into a “vaccine pass”. This meant a negative test was no longer enough and full proof of vaccination was necessary to enter places including cafés, restaurants, cinemas, libraries and long-distance trains. It will now be scrapped. But those entering hospitals will still be required to show either proof of vaccination, a negative test or proof of recent recovery from Covid. Just before the vaccine pass was introduced, Macron had explained that he really wanted to dump non-vaccinated people “in the shit” by making their daily lives as difficult as possible – a deliberately radical statement aimed to appeal to his own centrist electorate, which was overwhelmingly vaccinated and exasperated at the ongoing coronavirus crisis. But the country now has one of the highest rates of vaccination in Europe – at more than 90% of those eligible – and a vaccine pass is no longer seen as necessary by the government. From Monday, France will begin giving a fourth dose of vaccines to those aged 80 and over. The health minister, Olivier Véran, said the government remained “extremely vigilant”, adding that contamination rates had showed a 20% rise over the course of last week. He defended the government’s decision to lift restrictions, but said vulnerable people “must continue to protect themselves”. The easing of Covid restrictions weeks before the presidential election was seen as a deliberate government move to lighten the burden on French people who polls have shown were “fatigued” by the pandemic, and now increasingly worried by the war in Ukraine. An Ifop poll for the Journal du Dimanche last month showed 71% of French people were in favour of lifting the vaccine pass before the summer, including a high number of business owners. Despite difficulties such as a lack of masks at the start of the pandemic and a slow start to the vaccine programme, and anger over confusing rules in schools at the start of this year, Macron has been broadly trusted by voters to handle the Covid crisis, polls suggest, particularly in terms of protecting the French economy. With the war in Ukraine, Macron’s poll scores have risen – a poll for Les Echos this month found 40% of French people trusted him to “efficiently deal with the main problems facing the country”. But voters do not want war in Ukraine to be the only subject on the table in the run-up to the elections, and many continue to worry about the state of the French health system. An Ifop poll for the Hospital Federation of France on Sunday found 91% of French voters were concerned there were not enough healthcare staff in France. A majority of voters felt staff should be better paid, state hospitals better organised and care for elderly people improved, as well as adding more doctors in rural areas.",News/World news,France to lift most Covid controls as Macron rides high in polls,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/13/france-lift-most-covid-controls-macron-rides-high-polls
3/14/2022,"Synonyms for the verb “to walk” are plentiful – promenade, hike and trudge, amble and ramble. Where My Feet Fall, a new collection of essays both sprightly and ruminative, illustrates all these ambulatory attitudes and more, exploring the delights – and challenges – of that most essential of human activities, the placing of one foot in front of the other. The book is edited by veteran radio producer Duncan Minshull, and features contributions from some appropriately sturdy literary names, among them Richard Ford, Kamila Shamsie and Patrick Gale. Tasked with writing about a particular walk, the 20 writers were given a choice: revisit the old or chronicle the new. This was at the start of 2020, and as the pandemic took hold, several found themselves exploring their own neighbourhoods for the first time, while others footed it through memories of freer times. Determined to make the most of Italy’s eased lockdown restrictions, Tim Parks and his partner set off in the footsteps of a 19th-century Italian general, journeying across lake land – three days, 50 miles and a blazing 35 degrees to battle. The scorching sun, coupled with the giddiness of liberty regained, makes for scenes of near hallucinatory pastoral bliss: there amid giant lilies and foxgloves, a small butterfly alights on Parks’s lips. There are also blisters – the first of many in these pages, though it’s hard to imagine the likes of AL Kennedy suffering them. Having grown up in Scotland, where “to walk is to climb”, she has amassed kit. More valuable still is her attitude. “Why is it so pleasant to feel that burn in my legs and that slight rawness at the back of my throat from deep breaths of cold air?” she asks of a bitter, blustery hike up Cumbria’s Skiddaw. “It’s a proof of life.” Not all payoffs necessitate such intrepidity. For Agnès Poirier, flâneuring through the streets of Paris enabled her to “tame” the city as a student. A few days of walking the Grande Randonnée trail in France proved life-changing for a “feverish” Joanna Kavenna, and in Pico Iyer’s case, a daily stroll through suburban Japan – the same 40-minute stroll he’s been taking for more than a quarter of a century – is vital to his writing method. He’s not the only one. Along with dogs (always the best walking companions – even when they escape the lead like Irenosen Okojie’s aptly named beagle, Gogo) and directions (maps only ever tell half the story, and yes, it’s still possible to get lost in the age of GPS), the relationship between walking and writing becomes a recurring motif. Nicholas Shakespeare, for instance, recalls strolling with Borges in Buenos Aires and pottering down a garden path in Cambridge with George Steiner. Elsewhere, authors accompany authors in spirit rather than body. On his annual journey through the Hoo Peninsula, Will Self is haunted by Céline, Conrad and Dickens, while Keshava Guha takes EM Forster around Delhi, and Sinéad Gleeson makes an ambulatory pilgrimage to Maeve Brennan’s New York. Predictably, the book’s blurb alludes to walking’s benefits, but over the course of tens of thousands of steps, these essays summon vistas far broader and more nourishing than their authors’ mental health – more entertaining, too. “Walking is a strange discipline. Your mind charges all over the place,” observes Joanna Kavenna. Which is why you’ll find Harland Miller musing on classic horror fiction as he speed-limps along the hard shoulder of the M11, Sally Bayley meditating on the Latin meaning of “budgerigar” as she time travels back to girlhood, and Self considering topographic earworms. “Walking allows you to inhabit your imagination entirely”, Iyer notes. Likewise, reading about walking allows you to inhabit the writer’s imagination just as fully – surely the ultimate armchair travel.

3/14/2022,"Joe Root’s continuation as England Test captain may be in part down to a lack of alternatives but as the team flew to Barbados on Saturday, their interim head coach, Paul Collingwood, spoke of a “real unity” being formed under the Yorkshireman. These are early days in the post-Ashes rebuild and a drawn first Test against West Indies on a lifeless Antiguan pitch is not cause to bring out the bunting. Nevertheless, after an early wobble England were enterprising, energetic and batters banked some previously elusive runs with centuries for Root, Zak Crawley and Jonny Bairstow. Collingwood, holding the fort until a new director of cricket and head coach are appointed by the England and Wales Cricket Board, is modest about his own prospects for the second of those two vacancies. However he sees a team playing for a captain who, though a record 62 Tests into the job, retains a strong desire to lead. “You can sense that he’s got everybody behind him,” Collingwood said. “There’s a real unity. We’ve got a direction, we’ve got clarity, we were very honest with our conversations at the start of the tour and he looks as though he’s enjoying his cricket. “I really believe he can turn this team around. It’d be great if this was the backbone for many years. They’ve got the chance to be together for a lot of years and there are a lot of young players in there. I’m sure Joe would love to be captain for that.” Though eight players were dropped after the Ashes, the fact that two still merited retention on performance – Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad – has led some to speculate whether their presence somehow diminished Root’s authority or the environment, either in the dressing room or out on the field. Collingwood looked to dismiss the notion: “That’s really unfair to say that having those personalities there, Stuart and Jimmy, would make any difference. “The way [Root] has gone about his business right from ball one here in Antigua has been excellent. He’s committed, he’s determined, he’s very hungry to turn things round. No matter the personalities in the team, he’ll have that same attitude.” There is a quick turnaround before the second Test starts in Bridgetown on Wednesday but one change appears a given after Mark Wood’s right elbow issue – described as “an impingement” by Collingwood – materialised mid-match. Collingwood was more upbeat about Ollie Robinson’s hopes of a return, with the 6ft 5in right-armer “getting the ball through really well” out in the middle between sessions. The back spasms that ruled him out of the match – and dogged his previous outing in Hobart – means further fitness tests are required this week. A seam attack of Chris Woakes, Craig Overton, Ben Stokes and Wood that collectively sent down 139 overs for seven wickets at 47 runs apiece may require further refreshment, however. Saqib Mahmood and Matt Fisher, both of whom are uncapped, should also look to push their claims in the nets at the Kensington Oval. The thunder of Stokes notwithstanding, Jack Leach was the pick in Antigua, sending down 34 maidens from his 73.4 overs and claiming five wickets. The left-armer’s final tally might have been greater but for finding himself the wrong side of three umpire’s calls and Root’s failure to review an lbw shout against Jason Holder on the final day. Collingwood believes Leach is growing as a voice in the setup and, more broadly, wants the team to use Antigua as just the start. “We want to keep that as the benchmark,” said the former all-rounder. “Our fielding, our ground-fielding was superb, our energy, our fitness levels, that’s a good sign of where a team is. “The boys kept plugging away. Great signs but it’s 0-0 and we need to turn up in Barbados with the same attitude and character, and desire – all the things that win you Test matches. That performance level, we’ve given ourselves a good chance.” Asked about the prospect of making own role permanent, be it head coach or in charge of the white-ball setup if the role is split, Collingwood replied: “The simple fact is I haven’t experience in either. But look at it that way [and] you’ll never get a head coach role. I’m just looking to get through these games, not thinking too far ahead.”",Sport/Sport,Paul Collingwood backs ‘hungry’ Joe Root to turn England’s fortunes around,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/13/paul-collingwood-backs-hungry-joe-root-to-turn-englands-fortunes-around
3/14/2022,"Ukraine’s announcement that at least 1,300 of its soldiers have been killed so far during Russia’s invasion has been accompanied by an increasingly public acknowledgement of the country’s losses. Sombre funeral processions have become a daily sight, with photographs showing rows of flag-draped coffins being delivered for their funerals in cities including Lviv – with its historic garrison church of St Peter and St Paul. While as late as last week Ukrainian military officials were declining to disclose the scale of the country’s casualties, the announcement by the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Saturday of the estimated death toll appeared to have become inevitable, with social media, including from the country’s armed forces, increasingly honouring the fallen. In the course of the short and brutal conflict, Ukrainian social media has tracked a sombre change in attitudes as the war has progressed. Where posts once appeared marking how young volunteers had given up careers to go war to defend their country, told in inspiring terms, some now come with a grim coda – how they had gone to fight and fallen in an increasing public meditation on mourning. Among those in the second category was Ukrainian actor turned soldier Pasha Lee, who was killed in action on 6 March during the Russian shelling of Irpin, a town on the outskirts of Kyiv. Lee, aged 33, who served in one of Ukraine’s territorial defence units and had worked as an actor, TV host and composer, was mourned on Facebook by fellow Ukrainian actor Anastasiya Kasilova, who worked with Lee on the crime TV show Provincial. “He was an actor, a TV presenter, my colleague and good friend,” Kasilova posted about Lee. “Never forgive!” Other death notices have been posted by the Ukrainian armed forces on its Twitter feed, featuring a simple photo with a candle superimposed on it and brief details of who they were and how they died. Notable among those who have died is Inna Derusova, a field medic who is the first woman to be awarded the Hero of Ukraine title posthumously and who has been widely memorialised. Derusova was killed during the artillery attack on Okhtyrka on 24 February, the first day of Russia’s invasion, and was credited with saving more than 10 soldiers that day. The public engagement in Ukraine with its fallen stands in marked contrast to the Kremlin’s limits on how Russian military families are able to bury and mourn the dead from a conflict that it refuses to publicly recognise. Some families in Russia have said that despite being informed of their sons’ deaths, they have been told that the bodies will not be returned until the war is over.",News/World news,"Ukraine mourns its fallen as Zelenskiy says 1,300 soldiers killed",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/13/ukraine-mourns-soldiers-killed-russia-war-volodymyr-zelenskiy
3/14/2022,"Russian escalated its war in Ukraine with a strike on the a military base close to the Polish border that has previously hosted foreign military trainers from the UK, US and other countries, hours after it had warned that western supply lines into the embattled country were “legitimate targets”. The attack on Yavoriv killed at least 35 people and injured 134 more. Long viewed with suspicion by Russia – whose media has claimed falsely that in the past the facility was a secret Nato base in Ukraine – the proximity of the 140 square-mile facility to the Polish border, marks a sharp escalation in the scope of Russian airstrikes. On Thursday 24 February, Russia attacked Ukraine along multiple axes, bringing to a calamitous end weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts by western leaders to avert war. On Friday 25 February, Russian forces reached the outskirts of Kyiv and carried out an amphibious assault from the Sea of Azov near Mariupol. The shape of the Russian incursion became clearer: On Saturday 26 February, Russian forces in control of territory to the north-west of Kyiv continued their assault on the capital. Elsewhere, heavy fighting was reported in and around Kharkiv and there were Ukrainian counterattacks in some places previously claimed by Russian forces. On Monday 28 February, Russian rocket attacks killed dozens of people in Kharkiv. Pre-dawn blasts were heard again in Kyiv and in Mariupol, which was surrounded by Russian forces and under heavy attack. On Tuesday 1 March, Russian forces bombarded the government headquarters in Kharkiv, and the armoured column continued rolling towards the capital. On Wednesday 2 March, Moscow’s forces took the port and train station in the strategically important city of Kherson, on the Black Sea. Russian paratroopers landed in Kharkiv, after several days of fierce bombardment. Kyiv came under more heavy shelling. A week into the Russian invasion, on Thursday 3 March, the Black Sea port of Kherson became the first major Ukrainian target to fall under the de facto control of Moscow’s forces. On Friday 4 March the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was seized by Russian military forces after a fire sparked by overnight shelling burned for several hours. On Saturday 5 March a deal to evacuate civilians from the besieged city of Mariupol and the nearby town of Volnovakha collapsed, and residents in occupied Kherson and Melitopol took part in anti-Russia demonstrations. On Sunday 6 March civilians came under fire as they tried to leave areas including Irpin, where a young family was killed. On Monday 7 March Ukraine dismissed as immoral and unacceptable Russian proposals to evacuate civilians along routes into Russia or Belarus. On Tuesday 8 March civilians left Sumy and Irpin in the north, and Russia was accused of violating a ceasefire by shelling a proposed humanitarian corridor from besieged Mariupol. On Wednesday 9 March, a children’s hospital and maternity ward in Mariupol was destroyed by a Russian air strike. On Thursday 10 March a humanitarian convoy trying to reach Mariupol was forced to turn around due to fighting, and airstrikes struck the western city of Zhytomyr. Satellite images showed the extent of the destruction in Mariupol. Drone footage emerged of a Ukrainian ambush on a Russian armoured column just outside Brovary, an eastern suburb of Kyiv. On Friday 11 March Russian airstrikes have hit three cities, including two in the country’s west, as the scope of the military offensive widened. The raids hit airfields in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk, far from the main areas of conflict, and residential buildings in the strategically important city of Dnipro, which sits on the Dnieper River: Satellite imagery showed that a 40-mile convoy that has been approaching the capital, Kyiv, has dispersed as tanks and artillery move to what appear to be firing positions to the north-west of the city. Over the previous few months Russia had deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/russia-war-ukraine-complete-guide-maps-video-and-pictures
3/14/2022,"It was Steve Huxley, a Liverpudlian and long-term Barcelona resident, who introduced the city to craft beer when he opened the Barcelona Brewing Company in 1993, but it was a woman, Judit Cartex, who helped establish Barcelona as Spain’s craft beer capital. “Beer has always been a part of my life,” she says. “We were poor and all we had to drink was tap water, no Coca-Cola. Except on Sundays my mother and grandmother would open a litre bottle of beer to watch football on TV. Very English, no? “It was Steve who opened our eyes to the possibilities of craft beer, not just in Barcelona but in the rest of Spain,” says Cartex, who learned her trade from Huxley and ran her own brewery, Cerveza Barra, until the floor collapsed and the building was condemned. “As a brewer you feel you’re contributing to the common good. It’s not a job, it’s a vocation,” says Covadonga García Pérez, 24, one of many female brewers in this traditionally male world. She brews at La Textil, a sleek new brew pub in central Barcelona that is also a restaurant and a music venue. García Pérez is collaborating with another young woman, Cristina Fernández Romero, 27, who usually works at Espiga, a brewery just outside the city, but has joined her at La Textil on a brewing project. They have named their new beer Punto Violeta after the campaign to provide safe public places for women who are being harassed. “We want to reflect that women are welcome with open arms in the world of craft brewing,” they said. Respectively from Asturias and Madrid, the two ended up in Barcelona because “this is where it all began and where there are more craft beer bars and breweries”. Fernández Romero says she became interested in brewing during her Erasmus year in the Czech Republic, where she was astonished at the range of different beers. “I was amazed that using the same products you could make so many different kinds of beer,” she says. A hundred miles from Barcelona, Quiònia Pujol has taken things a step further, brewing beer from barley and hops she grows on her farm in the village of Almacelles. “I don’t drink commercial beer and when we started this in 2013 it was in order to make beer that I want to drink,” says Pujol. “We grow everything we need to make ecological craft beer. A beer farm like this is unique in Spain and possibly in Europe.” Pujol sells about half the Cervesa Lo Vilot she produces to bars in Barcelona. She dismisses the concept of a distinctively female brew, a view shared by Cartex, now director of the brewers’ convention InnBrew, who says: “I don’t think women make different or better beer. The difference is men don’t like to admit they don’t know something but women aren’t afraid to ask, so we learn more.” Cartex is typically forthright when asked about misogyny in the hitherto male milieu of craft beer. “I worked in construction, I play football, I ride a motorbike, I was a drummer in a rock band – all very male worlds,” she says. “As a woman in the craft beer scene, I’ve never had a problem. I’m 53 and I’m a big woman with a lot of attitude and I don’t take shit from anyone. It might not be the same for younger women.” However, far from encountering opposition, the young brewers collaborating at La Textil say that men are glad to see more women in the business. “What I like is that, when it comes to things that are physically challenging, male colleagues, instead of saying: ‘I’ll do it’, help me find a solution so I can do it myself,” says Fernández Romero. “It’s a dream doing this job,” she adds. “I feel like I’ve found my place in the world. We’re making something that makes people happy, something they can share.”",News/World news,‘It’s a vocation’: the women leading Barcelona’s craft beer revolution,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/13/its-a-vocation-the-women-leading-barcelonas-craft-beer-revolution
3/14/2022,"The director Jane Campion has called the actor Sam Elliott “a little bit sexist” and “a bitch”, for criticising The Power of the Dog, her Oscar- and Bafta-nominated western, for its driving theme of repressed homosexual desire and for being filmed in New Zealand. Campion’s film has 12 Oscar nominations, including best picture, best director, best adapted screenplay, best actor (Benedict Cumberbatch), best supporting actress (Kirsten Dunst) and two nominations for best supporting actor (Kodi Smit-McPhee and Jesse Plemons). Campion is the first woman to be nominated for best director twice. Campion spoke to Variety at the Directors Guild of America awards in Los Angeles on Saturday, at which she won the award for outstanding directorial achievement in theatrical feature film. She said: “I’m sorry, he was being a little bit of a B-I-T-C-H. I’m sorry to say it but he’s not a cowboy, he’s an actor. The west is a mythic space and there’s a lot of room on the range. I think it’s a little bit sexist.” She added: “I consider myself a creator. I think he thinks of me as a woman or something lesser first.” Elliott, who has starred in numerous westerns, spoke last month on Marc Maron’s WTF podcast. “Yeah, you wanna talk about that piece of shit?” he said. “You didn’t like that one?” Maron asked. “Fuck no,” Elliott said. “Why? I’ll tell you why I didn’t like it anyway. I looked at [it] when I was down there in Texas doing [the TV series] 1883 … “There was a fucking full page ad out in the LA Times, and there was a clip, and it talked about the evisceration of the American myth. And I thought ‘What the fuck? What the fuck?’ This is the guy that’s done westerns forever. The evisceration of the American west? They made it look like – what are all those dancers, those guys in New York that wear bowties and not much else? Remember them from back in the day?” Maron suggested he meant the Chippendales, an all-male strip troupe. Elliott said: “That’s what all these fucking cowboys in that movie looked like, running around in chaps and no shirts. There were all these allusions to homosexuality throughout the fucking movie.” Maron said: “I think that’s what the movie’s about.” Elliott said: “Well, what the fuck does this woman from down there – she’s a brilliant director – know about the American west, and why the fuck did she shoot this movie in New Zealand and call it Montana and say, ‘This is the way it was.’ That fucking rubbed me the wrong way, pal. “The myth is that they were these macho men out there with the cattle. I just come from fucking Texas where I was hanging out with families, not men, families, big, long, extended, multiple-generation families.” Elliott also complained about Campion’s star, saying: “I mean, Cumberbatch never got out of his fucking chaps. He had two pairs of chaps – a woolly pair and a leather pair. And every fucking time he would walk in from somewhere – he never was on a horse, maybe once – he’d walk into the fucking house, storm up the fucking stairs, go lay in his bed in his chaps and play his banjo. “It’s like, what the fuck?” Earlier this month, the Guardian published an interview in which Campion was asked: “Did you ever worry about overdoing all the leather and ropes and chaps?” Campion said: “I encouraged it! I loved it because they looked like satyrs. And when I looked at the pictures from the period, big woolies are really common; I guess Montana’s super-cold. So wearing a sheep on each leg is sort of helpful.” Elliott also asked: “Where’s the western in this western?” In partial answer, Campion told Variety: “When you think about the number of amazing westerns made in Spain by Sergio Leone, I consider myself a creator.” Of Elliott, she said: “I think he thinks of me as a woman or something lesser first, and I don’t appreciate that.”",Arts/Film,Jane Campion calls actor Sam Elliott ‘sexist’ for criticizing Power of the Dog,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/13/jane-campion-sam-elliott-sexist-bitch-power-of-the-dog
