3/7/2022,"On a frigid late December morning in the throes of the Omicron surge, I flicked off my alarm and peeked out the window: pitch black. I was awake, I was sure, and not lost in an REM-induced mirage. But it certainly felt like a dream, as I strapped on my backpack and walked through the doors of my old high school. In the 10 years since graduation, I had had a recurring nightmare that I was back inside that building. But now I was an adult in need of a part-time job to supplement my income as a freelance writer, and our nation’s public school system was facing the very real nightmare of a substitute teachers’ shortage. I set aside my fears and applied for the job. That system has long been mired in a substitute teacher shortage, which has only intensified during the pandemic. Long frustrated by low wages, substitutes – as well as other support staff workers – have been driven out of the profession, whether because of safety concerns, lack of childcare options or due to vaccine and mask mandates they believe to be government overreach. Schools are now ratcheting up day rates for substitute teachers and raising teaching salaries in a desperate attempt to fill the shortage. And the damage has been widespread: in October, a national EdWeek Research Center survey found that more than 75% of school principals and districts were having difficulty finding enough substitutes to cover teacher absences. The hope entering this school year was that kids could get back on track after years of mass closures and on-off virtual learning. But the road has been bumpier than expected. The shortage has led to people like me, with no education background – and, frankly, no interest in pursuing one – standing in front of classrooms with little knowledge on how to guide students, teach them, or how to manage their behavior. By late fall, schools were so desperate for warm bodies that all I needed was a bachelor’s degree and my fingerprints in the state system to qualify for the job – the requirements for substitute teachers to have teaching certifications had been dropped by the time I applied in November. “Résumé preferred,” read the Facebook post advertising the job I applied for, “but not required.” In other states, requirements were scaled back, requiring the simple ownership of a high school degree, and one school district in Texas called on parents to work as substitutes to fill the shortage. Elsewhere, measures have been even more extreme: New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham launched an initiative encouraging members of the national guard and state employees to volunteer to become licensed substitute teachers, and Lujan Grisham even became one herself, teaching kindergarten for one day. In one district in Oklahoma, police officers have worked as substitutes. Back at my high school, on Long Island, I locked eyes with my old guidance counsellor in the hallway on the morning of my first day. “What the hell am I gonna do?” I asked. “You’re going to be fine,” he chuckled. I was not so sure: I had received no formal training for the job. All that was expected of me, he said, was to take attendance, maintain a low noise level, and above all else, make sure the kids kept their masks on. I was basically a glorified babysitter – with less of the interaction. “Good morning, everyone,” I said to my first-period English class that morning. Over the next 42 minutes I would sit at my desk surfing the internet as the kids completed the work assigned by their teachers on their Chromebooks. Some talked among themselves, others simply slept – and I did what I was supposed to do; I just kept on browsing. My brief stint as a substitute teacher coincided with the worst of the Omicron wave in New York state, in December 2021 and January of this year. On 7 January, the state reached an all-time high of 90,132 new cases, with deaths on par of those a year prior – before we even had a vaccine. This dark situation was reflected in teachers’ attendance: on 3 January , the first day back after Christmas break, a colleague told me 42 teachers had called in sick. Yes, I saw some of my old teachers. No, they did not recognize me. There were also the teachers I did not see, whose classes I was filling in for, and who were rumored to be out because of Covid-19 infection or exposure. I started every class by taking attendance, and often after I called the name of a student who was absent, a kid would chime in: “she has Covid.” On my second day, I overheard one student tell her friends her father had tested positive the day before. From my desk I realized I was more than six feet removed from the student and let out a breath of relief. Contracting Covid would put myself and my family in danger, although we are all vaccinated and boosted. I could see why other teachers might not want to take the risk. As far as I could tell, no teachers or students came down with serious illness during my tenure, but one teacher told me he’d missed a month of school with a bad case of Covid-19 the previous year. Now he was vaccinated but he left up the Plexiglass surrounding his desk. Deb Berger, 75, a substitute teacher in the Saratoga Springs, New York, school district and the president of the Southern Adirondack Substitute Teachers Alliance, said the situation I experienced was not unusual. “It was really difficult in the beginning of the year,” Berger said. “Just the building I was in, there could be 40, 50 teachers out [in one day] and I know they didn’t have enough subs [to cover].” Berger said she was often the oldest person in the Saratoga Springs high school building where she has been subbing for the past five years. Berger’s age puts her at heightened risk of hospitalization if she contracts the coronavirus, and she says a lot of her older colleagues have been “hesitant” to work since the pandemic. Berger, on the other hand, does not feel threatened: “I can honestly say that I never felt scared during the pandemic. The district has taken the proper actions.,” she said. Despite New York’s Governor Kathy Hochul announcing plans to end the mask requirement this week, Berger added that she would still be wearing her mask at school. Some states are looking for younger substitute teachers; both Kansas State and Montclair State University, New Jersey, have launched programs preparing college students to be substitutes to help combat the shortage. Districts in other parts of the country have tried different strategies. At one point in early January, in Hays county, a suburban area about 30 miles outside Austin, Texas, the district was averaging 400 teacher absences per day. The school district called on parents to register to become substitutes to try to fill the gap. Brian McKinney, a parent in the district and owner of the local Memorial Miniature Golf and WWII Museum, needed some extra money and signed up. A former teacher, his certification had lapsed more than a decade ago, but after taking three hours of courses and passing two 20-question exams, he was thrown back inside the classroom. But he noticed his responsibilities were muted once he got into the classroom. “Now all of the quizzes are on their laptops online,” McKinney said. “So it’s really a matter of classroom discipline, and making sure they’re staying on task, not cutting up, disrupting class,” he said. Hays district is still averaging about 185 teacher absences per day, although its pool of substitutes grew to 400 after the initiative was launched and was covered in local press. “I feel like I did my part,” McKinney said. The Moore public school district in Oklahoma took a different approach, filling some of its classrooms on 18 January with armed officers from the Moore police department. That didn’t come without its controversies: on the first day of the officers’ start, locals uncovered photos of officers unmasked in classrooms that had been uploaded to the police department’s Facebook page. That same day, the state’s coronavirus cases reached its peak since the pandemic started. The Facebook post went viral, with reactions ranging from disgust to appreciation. “Looks like the school to prison pipeline just got a fast track,” one Facebook user wrote. “Because nothing says ‘study arithmetics’ during a global pandemic like an unmasked police officer with weapons on his belt staring at you,’” wrote another. It’s unclear if the district continued to use officers beyond 18 January – the police department did not respond to requests for comment – but their presence left an impact on area students. Nicole McAfee, a local activist who advocates for police reform, said students in districts around Moore had approached her and shared their discomfort over police in the classrooms, especially considering the reputation of state police in Black communities. A peer-reviewed study in the Lancet found that Oklahoma had the highest mortality rate of police violence among all 50 states from 1980-2019. “It certainly remains a concern to me that on any given day they may show up in a classroom where an unmasked cop is at the front of the room without any sort of the support around the trauma [that could bring] – especially for a state with one of the highest rates of incarceration around the country,” said McAfee. For many longtime subs, the risks associated with coming into schools simply aren’t worth the reward. In May 2020, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated the mean hourly wage for substitutes to be $17.35, and while some districts have upped compensation amid the pandemic, it’s often not enough. I earned $110 a day as a substitute, which is barely enough to cover rent and bills in most American cities. When districts can’t fill schools, they close and go virtual. A national survey of 148,400 parents conducted by the New York Times and data firm Dynata released 28 February found that 25% of children missed more than one week of in-person learning in January due to school closures from staff shortages, teachers’ union work stoppages or virus outbreaks, among other reasons. And schools that stay open despite shortages often leave students underserved. “We weren’t really learning when [teachers] were out. So it was hard to understand the topic they were trying to teach,” said one high school student at a public school in my county. “The sub comes in and sits there, and then we listen to a video and answer questions.” My district, based in a suburb just outside New York City, has not closed this year, but has experienced discord over the school mask mandate, which was lifted for one day in November before virus numbers started to shoot back up. My stint at the high school ended shorter than expected, as I received a job offer in my field. I savored my final few days, especially my sixth-period stops to the teachers’ cafeteria, where a kind lunch lady served me her homemade chicken noodle soup for $2 a bowl. My nightmares about being back in high school have stopped, but I fear that the bad dream enveloping the school might not have an endpoint.",Lifestyle/Life and style,A glorified babysitter: my time as an unqualified substitute teacher during the pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/07/pandemic-unqualified-substitute-teacher-new-york
3/7/2022,"Almost every console and computer, from the Sega Dreamcast to the humble Amstrad CPC, once had its very own light gun. Whether you were shooting ducks with the NES Zapper or downing baddies in Time Crisis on the PlayStation, they were ubiquitous – yet now they are all but extinct. Andrew Sinden aims to change that: he’s on a crusade to make light-gun games mainstream again. “I’d consider the project has failed if I don’t manage to do that,” he says. It all began around four years ago, when Sinden’s parents were cleaning out their loft. They came across his old NES, and asked him whether he still wanted it. “Of course, the answer was yes,” recalls Sinden. “And what I really wanted to do was play Duck Hunt with my kids.” But after hooking up the console to his television, he was dismayed to find that nothing happened when he pulled the Zapper’s trigger. “I completely forgot that light guns didn’t work on modern TVs,” he admits. “It was a real disappointment, because I thought Duck Hunt on a 50-inch TV would be amazing. I used to play it on a 14-inch TV!” The way light guns such as the Zapper work is intimately tied how to old-fashioned cathode-ray tube (CRT) TVs “paint” images on to the screen. A beam sweeps across from left to right and top to bottom, only ever projecting one pixel at a time. But the beam sweeps across so quickly, multiple times per second, that we perceive it as a continuous image. Typically, a light-gun game will make the screen flash white when you pull the trigger. The console will then check the light sensor in the gun to read when it goes from perceiving black to sensing white as the beam reaches the part of the screen the gun is pointing at. The console can then work out how long it took from the start of the screen flash to the moment when the gun sensed white, and that timing reveals where the gun was pointing. But none of this works with modern TVs, which use thousands of tiny, constantly lit LEDs. Since the demise of CRTs, the few light-gun games that have made it into the home have mostly done so via the Nintendo Wii. That console used an infrared sensor to detect where the Wii Remote was pointing, but this isn’t as accurate or fast as the CRT light guns of old. “It’s a different game mechanism,” says Sinden. “It’s a bit like using a mouse.” After his Duck Hunt disappointment, Sinden was suddenly struck by a different idea for how to make a light gun work with modern TVs – by adding a white border to the screen. He reasoned that if a camera in a light gun could pick up the border, it could use it to calculate exactly where the gun was pointing. And a bit of complex maths could even compensate for when the gun was aimed at an oblique angle to the screen. “Before I even made it, I was so sure it was going to work,” says Sinden. He used an old light gun to mock up a prototype, and his background as a software developer meant he was confident in creating the code to make it function. But the hardware was more of a challenge – he had to teach himself some rudimentary electrical engineering via the internet to work out how to put it all together. “The information’s there,” he says, “it just takes a while to actually understand it.” His thoughts turned to how it could be made into an actual product. He launched a Kickstarter campaign in 2018: “And it was a big, big failure really,” he remembers. “People didn’t believe it would work.” He estimated he would need £250,000 to put the gun into production, but only ended up raising around £2,000. At this point, Sinden thought about giving up. But his dad eventually talked him into pursuing his dream. “He was like, ‘Look, if you’re going to do it, you might as well go big’,” recalls Sinden, who decided to go back to Kickstarter in 2019. “This time I only asked for £25,000, because I’d already decided to go ahead anyway,” he says. “If the sales were low, then I was going to fund everything myself.” Second time around, he paid a 3D designer to come up with a more professional-looking prototype ahead of the Kickstarter campaign. On YouTube, he demonstrated the Sinden Lightgun to a waiting list of prospective buyers. When the Kickstarter launched, he smashed through his £25,000 target within a couple of days, eventually raising more than £238,000. But actually making the light gun wasn’t as easy as he thought. “I didn’t necessarily appreciate some of the intricacies of manufacturing,” Sinden admits. “Everything just took ages. And this was pre-pandemic as well.” The shell design had to be tweaked multiple times to make it suitable for injection moulding, and the electronics board needed numerous modifications, too. Sinden eventually begin shipping light guns to backers in September 2020, and started taking orders on Indiegogo for people who had missed out on the original Kickstarter campaign. By the end of 2021 he had shipped around 10,000 Sinden Lightguns. He estimates he will finally clear the order backlog by February, at which point he’ll be able to ship direct from stock. The guns don’t come cheap. A basic model costs £80, while a version with recoil will set you back £135. Sinden envisaged being able to get the price down as production increased, but the turmoil of the past couple of years has scuppered that plan. “All that’s happened is that any savings I’ve managed to make have been cancelled out by the pandemic,” he says, noting that component costs have continued to creep up. The current version of the Sinden Lightgun is compatible with PC and Raspberry Pi, but setting it up can be a little daunting. A wiki guides you through the process, and there’s a large Discord community to provide help if you get stuck. More problematic is the relative lack of light-gun games available on PC; most users turn to emulating older console games. It’s possible to connect a Sinden Lightgun to older consoles, but it’s a laborious process that necessitates building your own adapter. However, Sinden is already working on a plug-and-play version of the light gun for the original PlayStation, with adapters for other consoles to follow. Sinden’s ultimate aim is to make light-gun games mainstream again – and that means getting the big console manufacturers and publishers on board. “I’m working on it, that’s kind of all I can say,” he says. He still has a long way to go before his dream is realised. “When I get in touch with you to play Time Crisis 6 on the new Xbox or PlayStation,” he says, “that’s when I’ll have nailed it.”",Arts/Games,‘I just wanted to play Duck Hunt with my kids’: the man on a mission to bring back the light gun,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/mar/07/duck-hunt-light-gun
3/7/2022,"There is no more appropriate venue in which to stage a survey of post-second world war art in Britain than the Barbican in London. Like much of the painting, sculpture and photography on display, the arts centre itself emerged out of the devastation of the second world war. Literally built on a City of London bomb site, it was also an ambitious attempt to come to terms with the destruction of the past and imagine a new future. The mid-40s to the mid-60s are well known as the years when painters such as Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud and Frank Auerbach came to maturity; when vividly realised photojournalism documented a battered and broken Britain, and brutalist architecture – of which the Barbican remains a storied example – went on to define the modern cityscape. But for curator Jane Alison, the period is due for a reassessment. The “rough poetry” – in a phrase coined by brutalist architects Alison and Peter Smithson – to be found in the art that emerged in these decades came, she says, from a much wider base that has usually been acknowledged. While artists who had fled from Nazi Europe, such as Auerbach and Gustav Metzger, have long been included in the canon, Alison contends that the contribution of artists from the disintegrating empire who came to the UK is in need of deeper examination, as is the place of female artists in what was often a very macho scene. Importantly, this is a show of “art in Britain”, not “British art”. “In some ways the art world then was welcoming,” says Alison, “and artists from overseas” – Frank Bowling, Francis Newton Souza and Aubrey Williams are among those on display – “arrived with a sense of optimism and a desire to participate. But just as in wider society, the art world was also infected by racism, antisemitism and sexism. Artists too often found themselves marginalised, pigeonholed and excluded from the bigger shows.” Many of these struggles and stories are reflected in individual artworks such as Souza painting himself as St Sebastian or Magda Cordell’s proto-feminist focus on the female body as a subject of trauma. But Alison also sees continuities between artists operating in the same place at the same time. The “rough poetry” in their work often manifested itself in a preoccupation with the vulnerabilities and resilience of the body, and with a sense of making something new after the destruction of war. More tantalisingly, there was a pervasive sense of “off-kilterness”, as Alison puts it. “All the old ideologies had been discredited and people were a bit at sea – everything was open to being reconsidered.” There are obvious parallels between a sense of crisis then and now, as we grapple with the pandemic as well as emergencies around climate, refugees, equality and even the return of war again to Europe. During the run of the exhibition the contemporary artist Abbas Zahedi will seek to draw connections between the art on display and current anxieties through a series of works drawing on his projects in the fields of social practice, performance, writing and the moving image. “There is a comparable unease today to the convulsiveness that you see in the show,” explains Alison. “There is again a sensation of tumult that we have been once again thrown off balance. This exhibition is very much a project for our time.” Break-off by Gillian Ayres, 1961 (main picture)Female artists of the time had to struggle for recognition and Ayres was encouraged by tutors to move into traditionally female activities such as teaching needlework. This work sees a lighter, more colourful art emerging as we go into the 60s – but, says Barbican curator Jane Alison, “there’s still a kind of off-kilterness with the forms sliding off the edge of the painting”. God Save the Queen (Hampden Crescent, Paddington) by Roger Mayne, 1957Mayne, a self-taught photographer, made his reputation by capturing scenes of working-class children unselfconsciously adapting to the blighted environment around them. His starkly monochrome realism graphically illustrates the scars of war and also the prospects of building a new tomorrow. Mr Sebastian by Francis Newton Souza, 1955Souza was born in Goa in 1924 and brought up in Mumbai, where he was taught by the Jesuits. His work is full of Catholic imagery. Here is a sort of self-portrait of him as St Sebastian, painted after he moved to London. Souza encountered personal and professional difficulties in the UK and he depicts himself as not only assailed by arrows but also constrained by that most symbolic item of western conformity, the business suit. Head of Gerda Boehm by Frank Auerbach, 1964Auerbach is known for working with a small group of sitters for portraits, including his cousin Gerda. His painstaking process, involving multiple removals and reapplications of paint, results in a visceral and intense depiction of his subjects. Auerbach was just eight when he was sent to London from Berlin in 1939 – his parents remained in Germany and were later murdered in the concentration camps.

3/7/2022,"“In Wales, we are doing things differently,” explains the Welsh government on its website, 25 years after devolution gave it control over matters such as public health, housing, education and the economy. Covid-19 has upped the ante. In February, Wales became the first home nation to make vaccines available to five-to-11-year-olds, then launched a trial for a universal basic income. It also promoted the idea of a four-day working week (in line with its Well-being of Future Generations Act, the only legislation of its type in the world). The government also promotes the Welsh language, sparking criticism. In the February issue of the Critic, Jonathan Meades railed against the “totalitarian project” to get a million people speaking Welsh by 2050 (the current official total stands at 883,000, up by more than 150,000 from 2010). The BBC’s Jeremy Bowen also explored the topic in his Radio 4 series Being Welsh, complaining that the drive “to spread the language risks devaluing the identities of Welsh people like me”. You wonder why people choose not to celebrate a tongue that has survived centuries of suppression, but to fear it. It didn’t pass me by that both men do not live in Wales, but I do; over the past 20 years, I have watched young people becoming the lifeblood of the language. This is clear from the rising popularity of Welsh-language schools and in cross-party, non-nationalist independence campaigns such as YesCymru, which is dominated by younger voices, speaking in English and Welsh. Richard King talks about a “renewed sense of purpose” – a confidence the country seems to have gained in its separate identity – in the epilogue of Brittle With Relics: A History of Wales, 1962-1997. But the chapters that precede it reveal how tough to tread the early years were. Beginning with a famous speech in 1962 on the possible extinction of the Welsh language by Saunders Lewis, co-founder of independence party Plaid Cymru, King’s book proceeds through the horrors of the Aberfan disaster, the flooding of a village, Capel Celyn, in the Afon Tryweryn valley in 1965 to create a reservoir to provide water for Liverpool, and the South Wales miners’ strike, as well as previous failed attempts at devolution. Many rousing stories shine through this gloom: of the first march to Greenham Common from Cardiff, led by Ann Pettitt and Karmen Thomas, and the tales of Super Furry Animals and Gwenno, artists who have given the Welsh language a fresh edge. Brittle With Relics, however, is not a romantic book. Its construction as an oral history allows the story of Wales to appear less varnished, more nuanced, full of grit. Academics, activists, politicians and disaster survivors stand alongside the actor and now campaigner Michael Sheen, who has moved back to Port Talbot, Swansea’s former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams and Tredegar’s Neil Kinnock. The latter’s youthful recollections are particularly fascinating – he grew up around the Welsh valleys town of Tredegar, home to the Workmen’s Medical Aid Society, which inspired Aneurin Bevan to found the NHS. Here, locals also contributed a penny a week to fund a huge local library, snooker hall and 2,000-capacity concert hall, where Kinnock watched many famous opera singers perform. He also recounts his time as a young teacher at the Aberfan Workers’ Education Association in 1966, and the day he arrived at the village shortly after the slurry slip that killed 116 schoolchildren. “We realised after an hour or so that there was nothing we could do,” he says. We hear, too, about the 14-year-old James Dean Bradfield, later the frontman of Manic Street Preachers, buying Kinnock his tobacco on the day of the 1983 general election on the orders of his dad. Grammy-nominated producer David Wrench (Caribou, Sampha, FKA twigs) remembers raves he attended in caves, while BBC 6 Music DJ Huw Stephens also talks about his late father, Meic, who was responsible for the famous graffiti saying “Cofiwch Dryweryn” (Remember Tryweryn) just before the village was drowned. Welsh (Plural): Essays on the Future of Wales offers a collection of younger, more racially diverse voices, alongside establishment figures such as Niall Griffiths and the Wales Arts’ Review’s Gary Raymond. The editors include Swansea’s Darren Chetty, whose essay Whatever Happened to the Black Boy of Killay?, about a pub near his childhood home (and mine), hit me hard. Written from the perspective of a local with Welsh Indian and South African Dutch ancestry, it examines the removal of the pub sign and the stubbornness of the people who held on to its name, subtly underlining the racism endemic there, then and now. The stunning writing of Kandace Siobhan Walker (who explores the Brecon Beacons, Blackness and a lack of belonging) and a brutal attack documented by Shaheen Sutton also stress that Wales is no utopia. Reading these voices under the label of Welshness is an energising experience, nevertheless, reminding us of how far the country has come and, also, how far it has to go.

3/7/2022,"A Foreign Office minister has denied the UK is to offer Ukrainian refugees a new humanitarian-based route to the country, as he confirmed that it was possible only 50 people have been granted visas so far. James Cleverly, the minister for Europe and America, said the figures for refugees processed “will move very, very quickly”, but said it was taking time because there were procedures that needed to be followed. So far the UK has only been accepting those of the 1.3 million-plus Ukrainians to have fled the country since Russia invaded if they have family connections in the UK. On Monday, the Sun quoted Priti Patel, the home secretary, as saying she was “investigating the legal options to create a humanitarian route”. However, it is believed she was referring to an existing method where a refugee can be sponsored by a non-family member or an organisation. Cleverly confirmed on the BBC One Breakfast programme that there were no plans for a specific humanitarian route for Ukrainians. “No, this is what has been in place previously,” he said. “What we need to do is we need to have some sort of process. We need to know who is here, where they are staying, what support they might need, if there are child protection issues. “Whilst all of us would want to throw our arms open and be as generous as possible, there does need to be a process. We’re going to make that process as quick and as easy as possible. There is no particular target or limit – we want to play our part.” However, a Home Office source told the Guardian that “a new route is being worked on”. Asked how many visas had been issued so far, Cleverly did not reject a reported figure of about 50. “I know there were figures kicking around over the weekend that there were just 50,” Cleverly told Breakfast. “I haven’t had confirmation of that yet. Inevitably, as we’re work through this process quickly, there will be significantly more than that, but we don’t know exactly what the numbers will be.” Similarly, he did not dispute reports that more than 5,000 Ukrainians were waiting in Calais for appointments or permission to enter the UK. “These figures are moving very, very quickly. This is an unprecedented flow. There will be pressure on all our systems, right the way across Europe. We will be looking to move as quickly as we can so we can give people refuge.” Ministers are facing pressure to do more, including from some Conservative backbenchers. Asked on Monday if the UK refugee scheme had been a failure, Tom Tugendhat, the Tory MP who chairs the foreign affair select committee, told LBC Radio: “It’s certainly not a success, is it? What we need to do is to make sure that we get the Home Office is absolutely delivering to make sure we get support for those who are most in need. “The British people are extremely generous, you and I both know that. This isn’t some sort of illegal scam. This is perfectly obviously people fleeing for their lines and we need to be absolutely there to support them.” Challenged on the delays, Cleverly said there were procedures to follow, adding: “There is a process, we’re making that process quick. We need to know who’s here, where they’re going to stay, if there’s child support issues, if there are trauma support issues.” Asked whether the mental health toll of waiting at Calais was part of the consideration, he said: “You keep asking me the same question, and we’re looking if we can support them, we’re looking to make sure that they can come to the UK, and we’re looking to make sure that the process is quick. You’ve got to remember that two weeks ago, this situation didn’t exist at all.”",News/World news,UK minister denies plans for humanitarian route for Ukrainian refugees,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/uk-minister-denies-plans-for-humanitarian-route-for-ukrainian-refugees
3/7/2022,"More than a month after Peru’s worst ever environmental disaster on its coastline there are few signs of reckoning for Repsol, the Spanish energy company that manages the refinery where more than 10,000 barrels of crude oil spewed into the Pacific Ocean after a routine tanker discharge went awry. The black slick, pushed north by wind and currents, tarred 25 beaches, polluted three protected marine reserves, and covers an area of about 106 sq km (40 sq miles) – the size of Paris. It has wreaked destruction on one of the world’s richest marine ecosystems; killing fish and invertebrates, leaving more than 1,000 seabirds coated with oil, several hundred dead, and a toll on marine mammals such as endangered sea otters, according to Peru’s national service of state-protected natural areas (Sernanp). In the early hours of 15 January, a rupture in an underwater pipeline sent crude oil gushing into the ocean from the Italian-flagged tanker Mare Doricum which was discharging from an offshore buoy linked to La Pampilla, Peru’s biggest oil refinery, just north of the capital, Lima. The catastrophe for one of the world’s richest marine ecosystems, and at least 2,000 coastal fishers who depend on it, has raised the question of how environmental crimes should be punished during a time of climate crisis and catastrophic wildlife loss, as the oil firm, the captain of the tanker and the Peruvian state all blame one another. Under Peru’s strict liability law, Repsol is ultimately responsible for the spill, said Manuel Pulgar Vidal, the country’s former environment minister and now global leader of climate and energy at WWF. But Peru has a poor record of holding big business to account for pollution, he says. “Expectations for getting [decent] compensation are very low.” Peru accuses Repsol of reacting late, launching its contingency plan for the spill the day after it occurred. This is denied by the company, which said in a statement that it “activated its contingency plan and communicated the facts to the relevant authorities … the same night as the ship’s accident”. Four Repsol officials, including the company’s Peru president, Jaime Fernández-Cuesta, have been barred from leaving the country while a state prosecutor investigates whether the oil company properly maintained its system of underwater pipelines. News reports showed photos of the ruptured pipes covered in rust. While the oil company initially said a tsunami created by the eruption of a volcano in Tonga had triggered the spill, it later blamed the Mare Doricum, which it claims shifted its position during the oil discharge, allegations which the tanker company has denied. The ship has been seized by the Peruvian authorities and the vessel’s Italian captain, Giacomo Pisani, has been included in the investigation. Pisani alleges that there were a series of irregularities in the discharge process and claimed the company’s containment barriers were not long enough. Assigning blame has been further complicated because the Peruvian navy did not issue a tsunami warning after the Tonga volcanic eruption, unlike neighbouring Ecuador and Chile. While the argument over responsibility for the spill continues, the environmental and social consequences ripple outwards. The UN’s special rapporteur on toxics and human rights, Marcos Orellana, who spent a week in Peru last month, says the slow reaction of the company and the authorities “aggravated the impacts” on the environment and the people who depend on it for food. The effects on coastal fishing communities in Aucallama, about 30 miles north of the spill, have been overwhelming, as the tide of viscous crude clogs up the rock pools and cliffside crags where they catch crab, octopus, sea bass and grunt. Fishing came to an abrupt halt, says Marcelo Muñoz, 60, who has been making a living by casting a hook and line from the cliffside since he was 12. The fish were so plentiful that he could earn more than $50 a day selling directly to the seaside restaurants serving ceviche to summertime beachgoers. Now Muñoz and nearly 50 fellow artisanal fishers rely on food donations, which are shared in an “olla común”, a makeshift soup kitchen flanked by rows of empty clapboard eateries, all deserted during the busiest months of the year. They are among about 2,000 people living off fishing who have been affected along a 50-mile stretch of coastline, says Juan Carlos Sueiro, fisheries director at the conservation group Oceana Peru. “Businesses associated with the summer months, such as restaurants, parasols and transport have all been abruptly cancelled since mid-January and we believe they should be compensated too,” he says. On Friday, the company said it was trying to help about 4,100 people affected by the spill and had handed out 6,599 vouchers each worth £100 to affected families. There is not enough information to assess the social impacts of the oil spills, says Orellana. “This is a huge gap that needs to be addressed because people depend on the seas for sustenance, livelihoods and food.” The long-term effect on the ecosystem is even harder to calculate. While the oil is less visible, the toxic impact lingers. At La Isla Pescadores, a protected marine reserve 37 miles north of Lima and home to almost 200,000 seabirds, park guards are recovering between 10 and 20 dead birds from the water every day. Many initially died from the oil covering their nostrils, says Giancarlo Inga Díaz, a vet working for Sernanp. “In the following days and weeks, the oil ruins the quality of the feathers and they cease to be waterproof. When that happens, the animals die of hypothermia.” Others starve because they can no longer dive for fish, Inga Díaz says, or, over time, may become poisoned from ingesting toxins as they use their beaks to clean their feathers. “We believe that this pattern [of bird deaths] will continue in the long term,” he says. Repsol estimates the clean-up will cost $65m. The company has paid more than $400,000 in environmental fines but more are expected. Pulgar Vidal says Peru’s environmental assessment and enforcement agency should fine Repsol for the current clean-up and also order the firm to “adopt permanent monitoring” for at least the next five years. “Sadly, it is impossible to recover all the oil after a spill. At least 30% will remain in the ocean,” he says. A “culture of impunity” and a lack of effective regulation is hugely harmful in one of the world’s most biodiverse nations, Pulgar Vidal says, adding: “We have the laws, we have good oversight agencies – the problem is enforcement.” The global trend towards environmental justice in much of the world, he says, has “not reached Peru’s justice system”, which has a chequered record of enforcing environmental fines. Orellana says the institutions, norms and implementation need to be strengthened to deal with ecological incidents so that the “people who are affected, the nature that is affected, can be properly remediated and prevention can be a reality”.",News/Environment,Oil spill at sea: who will pay for Peru’s worst environmental disaster?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/07/oil-spill-at-sea-who-will-pay-peru-worst-environmental-disaster
3/7/2022,"KPMG and PwC, two of the big four global accountancy firms, have said they will cut off businesses in Russia and Belarus, in the latest examples of large multinational firms responding to the invasion of Ukraine by pulling out. The businesses will not necessarily close down but they will be legally separated – piling pressure on rivals Deloitte and EY to follow suit. KPMG has more than 4,500 workers and partners in Russia and Belarus, while PwC has 3,700. KPMG and PwC confirmed the businesses will no longer be able to use their brands or name once separated. Companies across the world have been scrambling to work out their exposure to Russia after the US, EU and UK sought to isolate it economically with sanctions. None of those have imposed blanket bans on Russia or Belarus, which supported the invasion by its bigger ally, but many have judged that reputational or financial risks were too great. Sanctions have also made it illegal for US, EU or UK companies to serve some of the biggest Russian businesses, including banks such as Sberbank, Gazprombank and VTB. Many services companies such as accountants, consultants and law firms have large Russian operations that had served big businesses but that has now come under threat. The consultancy Accenture last week said it would close the Russia office, while McKinsey and Boston Consulting Group said they would suspend client work there. Linklaters, a “magic circle” law firm that has carried out work for Russian state-owned companies, said it would close its Moscow office. Jon Holt, the chief executive of KPMG UK, said the firm had also decided to “terminate the small number of contracts that KPMG UK has that are related to individuals or entities that are controlled by the Russian state, or closely connected with the Russian regime”, in a post on social media on Sunday evening. A spokesperson for KPMG International said: “We believe we have a responsibility, along with other global businesses, to respond to the Russian government’s ongoing military attack on Ukraine. As a result, our Russia and Belarus firms will leave the KPMG network.” The decision to leave behind the Russia and Belarus networks was “incredibly difficult” but is “a consequence of the actions of the Russian government”, the statement said. Bob Moritz, PwC’s global chair, said he was “shocked and horrified by the senseless war that the Russian government is inflicting on Ukraine and its people”, also in a social media post. PwC said: “As a result of the Russian government’s invasion of Ukraine we have decided that, under the circumstances, PwC should not have a member firm in Russia and consequently PwC Russia will leave the network.” PwC added that it would “undertake an orderly transition for the business, and with a focus on the wellbeing of our 3,700 colleagues in PwC Russia”.",News/Business,KPMG and PwC to cut off businesses in Russia and Belarus,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/07/kpmg-and-pwc-to-cut-off-businesses-in-russia-and-belarus
3/7/2022,"Marcus Rashford is considering his future at Manchester United after growing unhappy with his game time under Ralf Rangnick. The forward hopes the situation will improve but is giving serious consideration for the first time to asking for a move from his boyhood club. Since Rashford played the whole of United’s draw at Newcastle on 27 December, he has started only two of the team’s 11 Premier League matches. On one occasion was he unavailable because of injury, twice he was an unused substitute and Sunday’s 4-1 defeat at Manchester City was his sixth appearance from the bench in that period. Although Rashford started the Champions League last-16 first leg at Atlético Madrid and the FA Cup ties against Aston Villa and Middlesbrough – United’s three other matches this year – he is frustrated at not playing more. He missed the opening two months of the season because of a shoulder operation. The 24-year-old has a contract to 2023 and the club are understood to have an option to extend for a further year. Rashford, who has spent his whole career with United, has effectively fallen behind Anthony Elanga in the Rangnick’s thinking. Rangnick will remain in interim charge only until the end of the season and Rashford must weigh up whether he thinks the picture will improve for him under the next manager. The England international would welcome any clarity the club can provide. There is no guarantee United would accede to any transfer request, with Rashford one of their most valuable assets. United are fully engaged in their search for a permanent manager, with Paris Saint-Germain’s Mauricio Pochettino having slipped from being the favoured candidate to being ranked alongside Ajax’s Erik ten Hag. Although United are not restricting their shortlist to that pair, the title defence of Ten Hag’s team, in leading the Eredivisie by two points with nine matches left, has increased admiration at the club for the 52-year-old. Pochettino, though, remains a strong candidate, and he and Ten Hag have been contacted by the United executive regarding potentially becoming Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s replacement.",Sport/Football,Marcus Rashford considering future at Manchester United over lack of minutes,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/07/marcus-rashford-considering-manchester-united-future-over-lack-of-game-time
3/7/2022,"After years of fighting in Afghanistan, Australia’s elite SAS regiment was a “toxic” environment riven by internecine fighting over decorations and medals, a serving SAS soldier has told the federal court. “The SASR is like a country wives’ club,” the soldier said under cross-examination on Monday, “rumours are spread, and they just get bigger and bigger and bigger”. The federal court is part way through a multimillion-dollar defamation trial brought by former SAS soldier, and Victoria Cross recipient, Ben Roberts-Smith. Roberts-Smith is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing. The still-serving SAS soldier, who served alongside Roberts-Smith in Afghanistan, has been subpoenaed to give evidence by the newspapers. The soldier, anonymised before the court as Person 18, gave evidence that another soldier, Person 4, broke down in tears on multiple separate occasions, recounting how he had seen Roberts-Smith kick an unarmed, handcuffed Afghan man off a cliff. In his evidence last week. Person 4 told the court Roberts-Smith then ordered the badly injured man to be dragged under a tree, where he was shot dead by another Australian soldier under Robert-Smith’s command. The alleged murder, during a September 2012 SAS raid on a village called Darwan in Afghanistan’s southern Uruzgan province, is one of the key allegations pleaded by the newspapers in their defence to Robert-Smith’s claim. Person 4 has previously told the court the allegation was reported to officers within the SAS in 2013 but no action was taken. Roberts-Smith has denied ever kicking anybody off a cliff. In his evidence before the court last year, Roberts-Smith said the alleged version of events in Darwan could not have happened because “there was no cliff … there was no kick”, and that the slain man was an enemy “spotter” who was discovered hiding in a cornfield carrying a radio, and was lawfully killed within the military’s rules of engagement. Person 18 said in the aftermath of repeated deployments to Afghanistan, the regiment was factionalised and riven by petty feuds and jealousies. “It has been a very toxic environment. Any rumour is expanded tenfold.” “It’s a very alpha environment where people are constantly trying to outdo each other or push each other … so when there’s an error, a mistake, it’s magnified.” He told the court some members were obsessive about what had happened in Afghanistan and what they believed to be their rightful recognition. “I had daily phone calls from Ben [Roberts-Smith], complaining about [another soldier] Person 5, and that they were potentially going to receive the same award.” Person 18 said, “pretty much every conversation I had with someone at work had something to do with Afghanistan, and I was tired of the conversation”. “The only connection I had to a lot of my peers was our time in Afghanistan. We weren’t actually friends, we just worked together.” There was particular controversy within the SAS over rumours alleging Roberts-Smith did not deserve his Victoria Cross, awarded after the 2010 Battle of Tizak, a 13-hour combat operation against an established Taliban stronghold, ultimately won by the Australian forces, the court heard. “The entire SASR has heard that [rumour] at some point I’m sure … it’s been a common rumour for the last 12 years,” Person 18 said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Person 5 is slated to be called to give evidence by lawyers, for Roberts-Smith, later in this trial. Person 18 has also given evidence he received two threatening letters from an anonymous self-described “friend of the regiment” warning him to recant his testimony to an inquiry led by the inspector general of the Australian Defence Force into allegations of war crimes committed by Australian troops. The court was told the letters arrived at the SAS barracks in Perth threatening him that he had “spread lies” and must withdraw his evidence, or he would “go down”. The newspapers have alleged during this trial that Roberts-Smith was the author of the letters, claiming he wore gloves to prepare and print off the documents at the offices of Channel Seven, bought stamps from a number of different shops and instructed a private investigator to address and mail the sealed envelopes he had placed them in. The court has also heard evidence from Roberts-Smith’s ex-wife, Emma Roberts, that she confronted Roberts-Smith over the letters when their contents were publicly reported, and that Roberts-Smith admitted to her that he had written them. John McLeod, a former policeman, has also told the court he was given four sealed envelopes by Roberts-Smith and asked to post two to Person 18, which he did without knowing their contents. He says he gave the other two letters to his lawyer, who later gave them to police. In his evidence last year, Roberts-Smith rejected his ex-wife’s and McLeod’s versions of events. He denied any involvement in the letters and said the conversation with his wife never occurred. Person 18 remains in the witness box.
