4/15/2022,"Retired judges have criticised the Morrison government’s broken promise on the federal anti-corruption commission as a “massive policy failure”, saying the Coalition’s explanation for walking away from the pledge was “spurious”. The Coalition is under pressure over its failure to introduce legislation establishing its proposed anti-corruption commission, despite promising to do so prior to the last election. Scott Morrison and other Liberal MPs have sought to blame a lack of Labor support for its failure to legislate the watchdog, an explanation described by Labor’s Chris Bowen as a “farce” and “complete nonsense”. Retired New South Wales supreme court judge Anthony Whealy, now chair of the Centre for Public Integrity, said the government’s stated reason for not legislating the anti-corruption commission was “quite spurious”. “The true reason for this massive policy failure is that, with a litany of scandalous rorts identified in audit reports, this government wishes to avoid proper scrutiny and being held publicly accountable,” he told the Guardian. The government’s proposed model, which was released as an exposure draft, was widely condemned as weak, ineffective and a “protection racket” for politicians. It had no ability to conduct public hearings for government corruption, despite allowing such hearings for law enforcement matters, and sets a near-impossibly high bar for investigations to commence. Professor Anne Twomey, one of the nation’s leading legal minds, described it as a “shamefully inadequate system, which appears designed to protect the corrupt from investigation”. A Guardian analysis found the threshold for beginning investigations was so high that the proposed watchdog would have been able to investigate only two of 40 recent political controversies. Liberal MP Andrew Bragg was questioned about the Coalition’s failure to legislate on ABC’s Q+A on Thursday night, and attempted to blame Labor for its lack of support. Bragg said he hoped to legislate the watchdog in the Coalition’s next term. “We’ve tried to establish an important institution and that hasn’t been possible and the Labor party wouldn’t agree so we’ll have to go it alone in the next term if we are returned to government,” he said. The response was met with laughter. Bowen, also appearing on the panel, said the model proposed by the Coalition was a “joke”. “Experts have said you would be better off doing nothing,” he said. “But to this whole farce of an argument that somehow they couldn’t introduce legislation, they haven’t even introduced the legislation, because the Labor party wouldn’t sign on to it, that’s a very interesting development. “So apparently now the government is not going to introduce any legislation unless we agree first. This is great news! This is wonderful news! It means we now have power of veto as the opposition. This is just complete nonsense.” Frontbenchers Stuart Robert and Simon Birmingham also said the Coalition would consider establishing the body if they win another term. “We will come back again and we will seek, through a bipartisan level, to get that going,” Robert said on Friday. Birmingham told Sky News that if the Coalition won in May it would have a mandate to implement its proposed model. That’s despite the promise being made prior to the last election, which the Coalition won. “We’re not going to legislate for the type of reputation-destroying, star chamber model we’ve seen in NSW,” he said. Whealy said the Coalition’s rationale for its broken promise was “quite spurious” and described it as a “massive policy failure”. “Simply put, it raises a serious question: can we trust the Coalition to honour any of its promises and to do so within an honest framework?” he said. On Friday the Centre for Public Integrity released a new report saying the ability to hold public hearings was “critical” to the success of recent Victorian Ibac and NSW Icac investigations. The NSW Icac was able to expose corruption to the public in 42 public hearings and 39 public reports between 2012-13 and 2019-20. Geoffrey Watson, former counsel assisting NSW Icac, said “sunlight is the best disinfectant”. Watson, now a director with the Centre for Public Integrity, said “many investigations would not be successful without them”. “Corruption flourishes in the dark,” he said. “Without public hearings the public may not find out about corruption investigations until years after the fact, if at all.”",News/Australia news,‘Massive policy failure’: retired judges blast Morrison’s broken promise on federal Icac,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/15/massive-policy-failure-retired-judges-blast-morrisons-broken-promise-on-federal-icac
4/15/2022,"The Russian flagship cruiser Moskva has sunk in the Black Sea off southern Ukraine, according to Russia’s defence ministry. It is still unclear whether the ship was hit by Ukrainian weaponry. Ukraine claims it was, but Russia maintains that a fire on board and then “stormy sea conditions” while it was being towed to port were to blame. Russia only has three of this flagship class of warship, which have crews of almost 500 sailors, and the loss of the Moskva is a big blow. The former CIA director David Petraeus described Russia’s admission as a “rare moment of truth … I’m surprised that they admitted it,” he told the BBC. Vladimir Putin may resort to using a tactical or low-yield nuclear weapon in light of military setbacks in the invasion of Ukraine, the CIA director, William Burns, has said. During a speech in Atlanta, Burns said: “Given the potential desperation of President Putin and the Russian leadership … none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low-yield nuclear weapons.” The Kremlin placed Russian nuclear forces on high alert shortly after the assault began on 24 February. Russia has asked Brazil for support in the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the G20 group of top economies to help it counter crippling sanctions, according to a letter seen by Reuters. On 30 March the Russian finance minister Anton Siluanov wrote asking for Brazil’s “support to prevent political accusations and discrimination attempts in international financial institutions and multilateral fora”. A Brazilian economy minister spokesperson indicated that Brazil would like Russia to remain part of discussions at multilateral organisations. The lives of about 2.7 million people with disabilities are at risk in Ukraine, a UN committee has warned, citing reports that many are trapped or abandoned in their homes, care centres and orphanages without basic supplies or medicines. The committee said it was “deeply disturbed” that the fate of people with disabilities in Ukraine is “largely unknown”. At least 503 civilians, including 24 children, have been killed in Ukraine’s eastern Kharkiv region since Russia launched its invasion on 24 February, the region’s local governor has said. Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city with a prewar population of about 1.5 million, is 40km (25 miles) from the Russian border. Russia’s deputy foreign minister Alexander Grushko said Moscow would take “security and defence measures that we will deem necessary” if Sweden and Finland join Nato. In an interview with the Russian state-owned news agency Tass, the minister said the membership in the military alliance would “seriously worsen the military situation” and lead to “the most undesirable consequences”. Finland and Sweden had earlier taken a major step towards joining Nato. Russia’s investigative committee said Ukrainian forces carried out at least six helicopter airstrikes on the village of Klimovo in the Russian region of Bryansk, injuring seven people. The Bryansk region governor said earlier that two residential buildings in the village had been hit by shelling. The area lies north of the Ukrainian region of Chernihiv. A village in Russia’s Belgorod region had also come under fire from Ukraine, the region’s governor said. Ukraine’s foreign ministry has appealed to the United Nations to facilitate the return of Ukrainian children who have been “illegally deported” to Russia. In a statement, the ministry said Russia had “engaged in state-organised kidnapping of children and destruction of the future of the Ukrainian nation”. France is planning to return its embassy to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. It had moved to the western city of Lviv in March as Russia invaded. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged allies to resume their normal diplomatic presence in Ukraine. Turkey is still working on organising a meeting between Putin and Zelenskiy, said the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the condition for a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents is a document ready for the two leaders to sign. The UK government has imposed sanctions on the Chelsea football club director Eugene Tenenbaum in an attempt to freeze up to £10bn of assets linked to the club’s Russian oligarch owner, Roman Abramovich. The UK said it was extending sanctions to Tenenbaum and David Davidovich, another close associate of Abramovich, because the oligarch had transferred billions of pounds of assets to the pair as Russia invaded Ukraine. Zelenskiy has issued a video compiled by his government that further urges European countries to give up Russian oil that provides “blood” money to Moscow, and appeals for more weapons to help Ukraine repel Russia’s invasion. A total of 2,557 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities through humanitarian corridors on Thursday, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said, with 289 of those from Mariupol. The head of the UN World Food Program, meanwhile, said people were being “starved to death” in the besieged city. Moody’s Investors Service has said that Russia “may be considered in default” if it fails to pay bonds in US dollars by 4 May. Russia paid two bonds in rubles this month after sanctions cut the country off from global financial systems and the US banned Moscow from making debt payments using dollars held in American banks. The payments in rubles “represent a change in payment terms” and may be considered a default, according to Moody’s. S&P Global Ratings has also declared Russia in default.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 51 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/15/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-51-of-the-invasion
4/15/2022,"Penrith’s ultimate successes have, historically, been fleeting. Not this time. The signing of star halfback Nathan Cleary and coach Ivan Cleary to long-term deals has set the Panthers up for sustainable security at the top of the premiership ladder. This may not be Melbourne Storm longevity but it is hard to see Penrith missing out on the top four anytime in the 2020s now the Clearys have locked themselves in as centrepieces. Amid a great deal of controversy in 2019, Nathan Cleary was reunited with his father Ivan, who left the Wests Tigers in acrimonious circumstances to return to Penrith for his second stint as head coach. It led to Phil Gould’s departure as Penrith’s executive general manager and left a great deal of angst among the Wests Tigers faithful that the driver of the bus had ditched the joint. It did net a remarkable third premiership for the Panthers last year though, the golden generation realising their potential. Penrith’s two previous titles, though, went as quickly as they came. Premierships can never be taken away but there was no doubt some disappointment the previous glories were not parlayed into dynasties. The long-awaited maiden win in 1991 was tragically cut short when the Panthers unravelled following the untimely death of Ben Alexander the year after. After winning in 2003, the Panthers returned to the top four the year after before five straight missed finals including a wooden spoon in 2007. The heavy fall from glory is unlikely to hit Penrith now the Clearys have re-signed. Nathan is a generational talent, almost universally regarded as the best half in the game, while Ivan sits among the very few elite coaches in the NRL at present, shy of the god-like status afforded Craig Bellamy and Trent Robinson but a top-level mentor with a premiership to his name and long-term job security. It is no mystery the two key ingredients to premiership success are top-shelf coaching and a dominant playmaker with elite talent. Ivan Cleary has long been touted as a quality coach even though his maiden premiership was a long time in the making. He played a long game though at Penrith, having the vision to understand what a golden age of youngsters including his uber-talented son could bring. It was not a smooth road but it did reach Shangri-La. Patience is an underrated virtue in rugby league. Clarity of vision is rare. Cleary has both. There is absolutely no doubting Nathan either. Considered a bulletproof prospect coming through the grades, he has done nothing but ascend over the course of his seven-year career. There is almost no argument in 2022 as to who the top half in the competition is. He has finished in the top three in the last two years of the Dally M Medal count, has a Clive Churchill Medal around his neck and a premiership ring on his finger and has guided New South Wales to three of the last four Origin series wins. And at just 24, the best is yet to come. Halfbacks of his style - smart, consistent, reliable perfectionists - are typically far better in their late 20s than they are in their early 20s. Cooper Cronk is probably the best comparison. Cronk lacked Cleary’s natural skills but worked tirelessly in the pursuit of consistent perfection, building perfect instincts to ensure defensive infallibility, impeccable kicking precision and an ability to see and understand and dissect the game on an otherworldly level. Cronk won six premierships and played in nine Ggrand finals including in each of his last four years. Seven of those were after his 24th birthday. Cleary projects for something similar, making the $10 million Penrith are staking on the duo a fairly astute investment. Premiership windows rarely last a decade but the exceptions are when a team has a top-level coach and a star half whose game is built to last. The Melbourne Storm has shown the modern way to build a team for longevity. Clubs must accept that players will come and players will go. The trick is to keep the transcendent, those that grow those around them, those that drive the tide, not ride it. Penrith have done just that. They lost Kurt Capewell and Matt Burton, Tyrone May and Brent Naden after their premiership. Villiame Kikau is off next year. Others will join. Penrith are playing it smart. They are investing in the stock that has minimal risk and the highest chance of return. The Panthers know that any chance of success requires the Clearys. They have locked both in. It’s gonna be a bright sunshiny day tomorrow and the next day and for a long time to go at the foot of the mountains.",Sport/Sport,Cleary deals set Panthers up for long-term success,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/15/cleary-deals-set-panthers-up-for-long-term-success
