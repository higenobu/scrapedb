3/13/2022,"Darling buds. There’s no denying them now. Sprung, almost everywhere. Early blossoms of many kinds. Some trees are shooting thin stems with newborn baby leaf, too, though this may be more of a southern thing. I can’t help but anxiously scan the horse chestnut across the road even though I know its sticky buds are likely still a way away. Can impatience be a virtue? The high Hampstead woods have clumps of flowering daffodils, far ahead of the bulbs we’ve planted in pots on the roof. There, the muscari (grape hyacinth) will be first: a Farmer Gracy freebie with the autumn narcissi and tulip order. I am hoping they are the darker blue, but of course we forgot to keep the bag they came in. We will anyway welcome the surprise. Looking out of our kitchen window, I see Kala’s winter clematis is exploding in flower: evergreen Clematis armandi ‘Apple Blossom’ delivered for her birthday two years ago by Mitzi & Maud, complete with good pot and bowed ribbon. One of our better presents. There are skinny branches of cheering cherry blossom in a vase on the table as I write – bought not scavenged, I hasten to add. The earlier flowers are near finished, but new leaf is bursting through. The roof-terrace Magnolia stellata is covered in furry bud – many times more than ever before. The first of the smooth cream petals are unfurling now. It will be a good year for them, I think. The kitchen-herb window box’s trailing rosemary has been in flower since before Christmas. All a bit confusing to me. It is now a mass of pale violet flowers set against the morning sky. I fear, though, the thyme and marjoram have suffered through the winter months. I’ll hope light pruning and warmer weather may bring a revival. Their turn and time will come. Allan Jenkins’s Plot 29 (4th Estate, £9.99) is out now.

3/13/2022,"Inside the cavernous confines of the airport in Iași, Romania, volunteers were offering food, drink and translation services to the continuous influx of Ukrainians fleeing war. Those arriving knew that bagging a place on a flight required patience, tenacity and no little luck. Routes to Italy, Austria, Poland and Ireland were all fully booked. Yet one destination stood out. The only planes leaving Iași last week not crammed with Ukrainians were those to London Luton, a snapshot of what critics call the UK’s heartless and chaotic approach to the largest refugee crisis in Europe since the second world war. About 550 miles north-east, in the Polish capital Warsaw, that approach was weighing heavily on the Nelipa family, as they spent Saturday waiting for news that their visa application had at least been read by the Home Office. The 72-hour window for a response had elapsed and the latest update indicated no UK government official had even looked at it. Warsaw is just the latest staging post for Viktoriia Nelipa, 38, her six-year-old daughter Mishel and autistic son Hryhorii, four, on a journey that began on 25 February with them fleeing fighting near their home in the Luhansk area of eastern Ukraine. They abandoned their car at Dnipro, caught a crowded 15-hour “evacuation train” to Lviv, then a bus to the border and onwards into Poland. They hoped to be in Newcastle by now, where Viktoriia’s mother, a British citizen, has lived for 15 years. Instead they are stuck in Warsaw. And on Sundaythey are set to become homeless. With the Polish capital inundated, accommodation has become almost impossible to find. Nelipa has no doubt that the Home Office’s “incomprehensible” decision to become the only European destination to demand a visa for Ukrainian refugees has thwarted their escape to the UK. Meanwhile in Brixham, Devon, Nelipa’s sister, Oksana Andriianova, 40, will spend Sunday coordinating help for hundreds of eligible Ukrainians also struggling to reach the UK. Despite 850 enquiries to her organisation, it has only helped a single case, via Paris, navigate the UK’s fiendish visa regime. “It’s been very difficult,” said Andriianova. Even judged against the Home Office’s recent standards, the mix of incompetence, hard-heartedness and sheer dishonesty in response to the invasion of Ukraine has, for many observers, set a new precedent. Last week started with the admission that 50 UK visas had been granted since Russia invaded Ukraine – or one for every 28,000 people given sanctuary by the EU at the same time. Home secretary Priti Patel then claimed she was considering a new route for refugees, but it did not materialise. Later, she announced a visa application centre had been established in Calais, but this was also untrue. By Wednesday, the Home Office said it was actually in Lille, but would not reveal where. A day later it became clear why: there wasn’t one. Those helping Ukrainian arrivals in northern France confirm that the Home Office is more focused on media management than assisting vulnerable refugees. “Ukrainians who spoke to the media, even when they weren’t eligible for a visa, immediately received one. Otherwise the Home Office was doing all it could to stop Ukrainians talking to the press,” said Clare Moseley, founder of charity Care4Calais. More than a fortnight into the invasion, the Home Office says it has granted about 1,000 visas to Ukrainians – fewer than 60 a day, when an average of 150,000 Ukrainians are fleeing their homeland daily. Latest data from the UN refugee agency reveals that more than 2.5 million have fled Ukraine. For those who choose to come to the UK, their gruelling journey to safety has been compounded by the difficulty of trying to obtain a visa. Nelipa says it is difficult to comprehend how hard it has been just to register the application. Yet when they first visited Warsaw’s UK visa processing centre on 6 March – with her mother Lyudmila Milotay, 66, who was visiting from Tyneside when Russia invaded and fled with them – they were relatively upbeat. Although the centre was supposed to be shut that day, staff had volunteered to help tackle the backlog and a huge crowd had assembled outside. However, the private firm awarded the Home Office’s visa contract business appears to have let them down. TLScontact, which the Home Office watchdog was told last year had a “sole focus” on making money, has struggled under its responsibilities, according to many Ukrainian refugees including Nelipa. “The TLS website did not work. Staff tried to answer people’s questions, but both sides were running out of strength and patience. People were sitting in corridors after trying to get an appointment for days,” she said. Labour has released details of how TLScontact, a subsidiary of Teleperformance, has secured more than £4bn in government contracts. Technical difficulties meant Nelipa and her children could only upload one of three sets of documents. The following day, 7 March, they returned to the centre at 8am and joined a queue of more than 100 people. They stood outside in the punishing cold for more than 12 hours as Nelipa grew increasingly concerned for her son’s wellbeing. Hryhorii becomes distressed in busy environments and their overcrowded hotel had started to terrify him. Nelipa then learned they would have to wait another 10 days to submit their documents. Only the intervention of the visa centre manager, who allowed them to jump the queue and submit their application, spared them. “She agreed to accept us as he [Hryhorii] could no longer keep returning to his room with a huge number of people,” said Nelipa. But more complications followed. “After submitting the documents and biometrics, we were promised that within 24-72 hours there would be a result of the consideration. That has passed but the application tracker showed the information was not transferred,” she added. Andriianova, speaking from Devon on Saturday, said that her sister’s ordeal was typical. “The Home Office has asked for so much documentation that needs to be translated and transferred to the application form. Most people, particularly those in such a stressful situation, are not technically able to do it.” Another outcome of the UK’s restrictive visa approach is also evident with the Nelipa family’s plight. “For us the saddest part of this situation is that my sister had a nanny for her autistic boy who has helped him from the day he was born and is like a second mother. But there is no way for her to get to the UK at the moment. Why should we leave her in Poland? She will have nowhere to stay, and with who? She is part of our family,” said Andriianova. Yegor Lanovenko, who runs the Opora volunteer network, has spoken to hundreds of stranded Ukrainians trying to reach the UK in the past week, including elderly parents needing dialysis in Warsaw and bipolar children requiring urgent care in Prague. Lanovenko said: “There is little that’s humanitarian or safe in forcing refugees who have fled their homes in traumatic circumstances to navigate poorly and inconsistently implemented visa bureaucracy, find accommodation and resources for long enough to make it to appointments and visa decisions in a completely foreign country, while their families wait powerlessly in the UK.” For those like Nelipa, the uncertainty has become the one constant in her life. Like many, she has said farewell to her husband, who has stayed to fight in Kharkiv. Their family home in Rubizhne lies close to the Russian border. On the first day of the invasion it was subject to fierce shelling. A return seems highly unlikely any time soon. Andriianova said: “People have been shocked about the UK’s visa process. But we are Ukrainian, we help each other, we have learned to find hope.”",News/World news,"Stranded and desperate, Ukranian refugees wait for the Home Office reply.

3/13/2022,"Cecchi Sagrato Chianti Riserva, Italy 2020 (£6.99, reduced from £10.79 until Tuesday, 15 March, Waitrose) Few wine regions have the same range in price you find in Tuscany. At one extreme, you have some of the glitziest wine estates in the world producing wines with pedantically (and expensively) fastidious attention to detail. The seamless, velvet feel and brocaded complexity of a wine such as Ornellaia 2019 – a Super Tuscan (or Bordeaux-inspired) red blend from the southern Tuscan coastal vineyards of Bolgheri that had its bells and whistles (online) launch, complete with artist commissioned limited-edition bottles and labels in February ahead of its release to the general public (with a retail price likely around £200) on 1 April – is a luxury good on a par with anything on offer at Florence’s fashion houses. At the other extreme, you have vast amounts of quasi-industrial chianti, much of it thin and grim and sold as house wines in the world’s less discriminating trattorias and pizzerias, but at least some of it – step forward Cecchi’s on-offer bottle at Waitrose – offering a satisfyingly supple sour-cherry partner for pasta. Morrisons The Best Toscana, Italy 2019 (£10, Morrisons) Tuscany has been at the centre of some of the wine world’s noisiest battles over questions of authenticity. Should producers confine their efforts to local grape varieties, notably variants of sangiovese, the great red variety that is either the sole or majority ingredient in its most famous red wines: Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino, Vino Nobile di Montepulciano? Or should producers be able to plant what they like, using international (by which they really mean “French”) varieties such as cabernet sauvignon, merlot or syrah? As with all questions of wine, I’m very much of the woolly-wet liberal persuasion in thinking that both have a place. Modern Tuscany would be much the poorer without wines such as Ornellaia and its great Super Tuscan Bolgheri neighbour, Sassicaia, with their distinctively Tuscan take on the classic Bordeaux formula. And a wine such as Morrisons’ blend of sangiovese with pugnitello and Bordeaux’s cabernet and merlot, proves that you can make darkly chewy, good-value, warming reds by mixing things up. Squarcialupi Cosimo Bojola, Chianti Classico, Italy 2018 (£22.45, independent.wine) Still, while I’m far from dogmatic on the issue, it has to be said that the great majority of my favourite Tuscan red wines over the years have been sangiovese-based. I’d start a list of recent standouts that, between them, show off the grape’s multifarious abilities, with a pair of classic Chianti Classico: Castello di Ama Chianti Classico Ama 2019 (£20.95, vinissmus.co.uk) is wonderfully fragrant and fluent, with notes of oregano and sage among the slick of fresh cherry fruit, while Poggerino Chianti Classico 2019 (£19.95, leaandsandeman.co.uk) is similarly pure and cherryish, almost racy, with a tart-plum-skin edge. Also in the Chianti Classico area, I was very taken with a Tuscan take on the current fashion for using that most ancient of winemaking vessels, the clay amphora: there’s something of Campari’s mix of sour-sweet red fruit and bitter herbiness in the joyously juicy Cosimo Bojola, while Poggio Antico Brunello di Montalcino Riserva 2016 mixes profound brooding depths with alluring aromatic detail (£92.23, wine-invest.co.uk).",Lifestyle/Food,Tuscany’s wine superpower | David Williams,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/mar/13/tusancy-wine-superpower-bottle-for-every-budget
3/13/2022,"To avoid dangerous opposition on the ground from Russian forces, it is essential for protected humanitarian support to Ukraine to come from non-Nato countries, thereby reducing the risk of escalation of military action, including possible nuclear warfare. If the UN general assembly provides support for humanitarian forces entering Ukraine and if President Zelenskiy’s government invites such support, secure humanitarian aid, including medical assistance for pregnant women, babies, severely ill children, injured, elderly and disabled people might be achieved. Such support could include protected humanitarian corridors, protection of hospitals and other health facilities and safe medical evacuation when needed. We are not aware of any legal reason against this approach and it avoids the UN security council issue of a Russian veto. In 2019, the World Bank reported that 138 non-Nato countries/territories have a total of 21,748,000 military personnel (minus Russia and Ukraine). These countries combined have the economic strength, expertise in humanitarian missions and the military capacity to provide secure humanitarian protection for Ukraine. The question is whether, if requested by Ukraine, the UN would be willing to lead and, also, whether countries would be willing to work together to provide international forces to secure protected humanitarian assistance in Ukraine as a matter of urgency.

However, in that ancient war epic the Iliad, enemies Achilles and Priam are united by a shared experience of grief. Some students born in Russia, and in Ukraine, will be bereaved by the senseless fighting. It is important that support is openly available and accessible – and without “blame” for the young people who feel so far from home.Woody CaanDuxford, Cambridge I enjoyed Cathy Rentzenbrink’s piece and am equally dismayed by the preposterous teaching of complex (and unnecessary) grammar to primary school students (“Fronted adverbials be damned. Let’s teach the young what really matters”, Comment). I adore grammar – my interest developed when I learned Latin (a great way to be introduced to its beauty) – and I like nothing better than spotting a jussive subjunctive. But that’s just me. Educators should treat grammar as they teach (I hope) history, biology, literature or PE: give a child an engaging taste and hope that she grabs what suits her and runs with it.Alison CarterLindfield, West Sussex Your account of the dismay felt by Vanessa Bowman on finding her art was being stolen online was welcome, but described only a fraction of the digital theft of creative work (“‘They took my world’: fashion giant Shein accused of art theft”, News). The same goes for musicians and writers. My wife and I are both full-time writers. Our earnings are meagre and have shrunk over the past decade. It is extraordinarily galling to find our work repeatedly billed as “free download” on the internet. It is no better than shoplifting.David McDowallRichmond, London I take issue with Charlie Porter’s use of the term “gender critical” (“Clothes maketh the gender-fluid man”, Focus). It should be obvious that the term describes those of us who deride the whole concept of gender, based as it is in regressive stereotypes of what is “masculine” or “feminine”. Those of us who grew up in the 1970s and 1980s have spent decades fighting those assumptions, including entering then male-dominated professions. Many of us were “gender non-conforming” as children and still are. Billy Porter is no less a man for wearing a dress to the Oscars, just as Greta Garbo was still a woman when wearing a tuxedo. That is the gender-critical position – that while our sexes are fixed, our expression as people is infinite and should not be restricted. We also do not ignore the barriers to full equality – the assumptions that women should always be “kind” being especially pernicious in the current climate. To paraphrase Rebecca West, I am a feminist because I am not a doormat.Dr Annette NearyMenlough, Co Galway, Ireland Tristram Hunt would like Stoke to create a national pottery museum, (“Pottery challenge thrown down to Stoke: celebrate your heritage”, News). I’m sure it would love to. However, with Londoners getting far more per head spent on them for the arts and culture than on those elsewhere, I’d make a bet it’s not going to happen. Stoke is on a list of areas outside London that has been promised a share of a lump sum of money, according to Nadine Dorries, to help level up the arts. But this will be just a one-off payment. Outside London, councils spend on arts or bin collections, arts or children’s services, arts or any other number of essentials. If Hunt wants a national pottery museum in Stoke, let him share a chunk of the V&A’s funding with it on a yearly basis.Sharon MaherWigston, Leicestershire If “the main impact of higher gas and oil prices will be to cause a severe hit to household finances” (“Bank of England’s war footing won’t be a crowd pleaser”, Business), won’t workers have to secure the “inflation-busting wage rises over the coming months” that Bank governor Andrew Bailey feared and economist Andrew Goodwin thought unlikely to materialise, just in order to stay afloat?David MurrayWallington, Surrey I was saddened to read about the death of foreign correspondent Hugh O’Shaughnessy (Comment), who was a friend and inspiration to me. He was a thorn in the side of Latin American dictatorships and those who supported them. I came across numerous references to Hugh in Foreign Office papers while I was researching Britain’s relations with the Pinochet dictatorship and the Argentine military regime (1976-83) in the British National Archives. The Foreign Office described him as one of “the triumvirate of Latin American correspondents who influence British opinion” (along with The Guardian’s Richard Gott and Christopher Roper). Hugh would never be silenced. On one occasion in 1981, the Financial Times asked him to write an article to accompany an FT-sponsored conference on the benefits of investing in Argentina (then a military regime). Rather than write a puff piece, his report highlighted human rights abuses. The British ambassador, Anthony Williams, who spoke at the conference, was furious and demanded that the Foreign Office complain to the editor. But Hugh, as always, stuck to his guns.Dr Grace LivingstoneLondon N6",News/From the Observer,Vulnerable Ukrainians need non-Nato support | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/mar/13/vulnerable-ukrainians-need-non-nato-support
3/13/2022,"More than two weeks into the war in Ukraine, and the unthinkable is not only being thought, it’s being said out loud: could Putin use nuclear weapons? The Ukrainian forcess’ tenacity in fighting back has been extraordinary, but could it make Putin even more dangerous? And what happens if he fails with conventional weapons? Will he use unconventional ones next? It’s the right question. It’s just four years too late. Because he’s already used unconventional weapons. Not in Ukraine, but right here, in Britain. On 4 March 2018, Putin deployed a chemical weapon against a civilian population. Our civilian population. Us. The poisoning of Sergei Skripal may have played out in the British press as a “botched assassination attempt”, but that’s just half of a more terrifying story. Because Salisbury is not just a pretty, quintessentially English market town with a famous cathedral, which Skripal’s poisoners mocked us with when they claimed to have visited it. It’s also a home to the British military establishment, and some of its highest ranking officers, adjoining the biggest military training ground in Britain, Salisbury Plain. And Putin struck at its heart. Was it Skripal he was after? Or Salisbury? Or, as it turned out, both? Because two Russian soldiers – military intelligence officers from the GRU agency – caught a commercial flight to London, sauntered down a Salisbury street without making any effort to disguise themselves, in full view of 100 or more security cameras, and released a deadly nerve agent. And then? Then they threw away the bottle. Three months later, an Amesbury resident, Charlie Rowley, fished it out of a charity bin and gave it to his girlfriend, Dawn Sturgess. She died, agonisingly. This was a British citizen murdered by the Kremlin. But here’s what’s worse. What if she hadn’t been given the vial? What if the bottle had gone to the charity shop? Or into a bin lorry? Or been crushed and taken to the tip? Or had entered the water table? In a recent interview, Fiona Hill, formerly the national security adviser on Russia to Donald Trump, makes her thoughts on the incident plain. “There was enough nerve agent in that bottle to kill several thousand people,” she said. It proved Putin was prepared to use any “cruel and unusual weapon” he has, she said. “And he wants us to know that.” He wants us to know that. And, by Hill’s analysis, the poisoning of Sergei Skripal looks less like a “botched assassination attempt” and more like a botched terror attack. At the very least it was a stark, unmistakable message from Russia to Nato, the very definition of hybrid warfare: a combined military and information operation. Certainly, governments around the world read it as such. It was an seen as an attack on Nato. There was unprecedented international cooperation: Nato agreed and imposed sanctions. Hundreds of Russian “diplomats” – spies – were expelled from embassies around the world. But what we now must recognise is that the British government’s response to the Skripal poisoning, and specifically Boris Johnson’s role in it, was a glaring national security failure. To understand this, we need to rewind a few months earlier. On 30 October 2017, the FBI made it known that its investigation into Russian interference in the US election, led by special counsel Robert Mueller, had begun in London. Two days later, on 1 November, the Labour MP Chris Byrant asked Johnson, then foreign secretary, whether he had seen any evidence of Russian interference in British elections. “Not a sausage,” he said. “Niet.” Yet two weeks later Theresa May, then prime minister, made a landmark speech at the Lord Mayor’s banquet: “Russia,” she said. “We know what you are doing. And you will not succeed.” She also detailed how Russia had mounted “a sustained campaign of cyber, espionage and corruption. This has included meddling in elections.” And, crucially, she acknowledged the “weaponising” of information via social media, Russia’s information warfare that was a significant part of the FBI’s investigation. Three months later, Putin sent her a weapons grade nerve agent on a Moscow-London Aeroflot flight. But it doesn’t end there. Because that April, Johnson flew to Nato’s headquarters in Brussels and met the US secretary of state and the rest of the alliance’s foreign ministers: it was a crucial, highly sensitive meeting to discuss how Nato would deal with Russia ahead of its July summit. A year later, the Guardian would reveal that Johnson had travelled directly from that summit to the Italian villa of Evgeny Lebedev, the UK-based Russian newspaper proprietor. It published a photograph showing him alone and dishevelled at San Francesco d’Assisi airport, no security in sight. And four months after that, in November 2019, we reported in the Observer a singular fact: that Alexander Lebedev, Evgeny’s father, an ex-KGB officer, had flown in to join him. Anyone with any knowledge of Russian intelligence will tell you there is no such thing as an ex-KGB officer. But, as ever in Britain, we latch on to the wrong details at the wrong time: last week, following news reports, it became a scandal that Johnson had made Evgeny a lord against the advice of his own security services (he denies interfering in the appointment). Of course, it is. But the meeting with Alexander Lebedev is of another order. And it isn’t a scandal, it’s a national security failure. And it must now be investigated. The meeting with Alexander Lebedev was undertaken without a security protocol, the knowledge of his department officials or, it must be assumed, the prime minister. And when it became known, Johnson should have not just been sacked, he should have been questioned by both the police and the prime minister. Except, by the time the Observer revealed it, Johnson was the prime minister. We have to finally understand what has happened here. Russia’s attack on our democracy has been covered up. It’s what the parliamentary intelligence and security committee’s Russia report revealed beyond all doubt. And all available evidence suggests this cover-up leads back to Johnson. It was Johnson who claimed there was “not a sausage” of evidence. It was Johnson who suppressed the report’s publication. And it was Johnson who had direct oversight of MI6 as foreign secretary when, as the report said, it “actively avoided” investigating. It shouldn’t have taken the prospect of a third world war to reveal this. And it didn’t. It has been in plain sight for two and a half years. It is in plain sight now. And our national security depends on us all finally seeing it.",News/UK news,Putin has already deployed a chemical weapon.

3/13/2022,"An elementary school administrator in Mississippi has said he was fired for reading I Need a New Butt!, a humorous children’s book about bottoms, to a class of second-graders. The incident has spurred criticism from free speech advocates, who claim the termination could have a chilling effect at a time of conservative-fueled pushes for book bans in schools across the US. On 2 March, Read Across America Day, pupils aged six and seven from Hinds county, Mississippi were waiting for a school administrator to read to them in a Zoom session, the New York Times reported. The administrator was unable to attend so Toby Price, an assistant principal at Gary Road Elementary School who was in his office, stepped in. He quickly picked up I Need a New Butt!, by Dawn McMillan, and started reading to around 240 children. I Need a New Butt!, for readers aged between four and eight, is about a boy who sets out to find a new bottom after seeing a “crack” in his buttocks which makes him afraid it is broken. Price, who has been teaching for 20 years, said the district superintendent, Delesicia Martin, called him into her office and told him he was being placed on leave. Two days later, Price said, he was accused of breaking the Mississippi Educator Code of Ethics, and fired. “I expected a write up,” Price told the Times. “I did not expect to get terminated. I cried the entire way home.” Did I want to be in the New York Times one day? Yes! For my kids book, comics, or Grog the Zombie videos. But here we are… https://t.co/eyvhSXRx6o In a letter to Price, the superintendent reportedly called the book “inappropriate”, pointing to references to flatulence and noting that it “described butts in various colors, shapes and sizes (example: fireproof, bullet proof, bomb proof)”. Price said school officials told him they feared complaints from parents and Martin said he had been “unprofessional”. Price told the Times he had a lawyer and would fight his firing. Neither Martin nor members of the school board immediately responded to Guardian requests for comment. Pen America, the authors’ organization, urged school officials to reverse their decision. “Certainly, the book in question is meant to be humorous for a young audience, and fellow educators might reasonably question if it was the optimal choice for this particular occasion,” the organization said. “But in positioning the act of reading a book as a violation of ethics, the district is implying that any educator could be terminated under similar circumstances, whenever an anonymous source feels a book read to students is ‘inappropriate’ for any reason. “Such a precedent could be readily abused, enforced with unbridled discretion to censor the reading of books in schools.” Toby your compassion as an educator is not lost in all of this. I am here to be a support for you and all you have done for public education. Price told the Times literacy instruction was crucial at his school, in a county where more than 21% live under the poverty line. “We have a lot of reluctant readers,” Price said. “I am a firm believer that reluctant readers need the silly, funny books to hook them in.” He has three children to support, he said, two with severe autism, adding: “I’m tired. I’m stressed. I’m overwhelmed. I need to work.” Price received support on social media, including on the school’s Facebook page. “My granddaughter heard him read the book and thought it was hilarious and not at all inappropriate!” one commenter wrote. “When they do have a hearing, believe me, me and Baby Girl’s gonna be front and center! ”",News/US news,Mississippi teacher fired for reading I Need a New Butt! to children,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/12/i-need-a-new-butt-teacher-fired-mississippi
3/13/2022,"Double Dragon, 84 Rosebery Avenue, London EC1R 4QY (020 7683 0326). Lunch £7-£13, all dishes £5-£14.50, desserts £8, wines from £23 In the 1970s, my late mother, Claire, became a regular at a restaurant called Thomas De Quincey’s in Covent Garden. It was named after the 19th-century essayist who had written his most famous work, Confessions of an English Opium-Eater, while living in the same building. If an editor or publisher needed schmoozing she lunched them there, and talked breathlessly afterwards about the ethereally light quenelles of pike mousse they served, but she never took me. I understood Thomas De Quincey’s to be a part of the glamorous adult world to which I had not yet been granted access. A couple of years ago, I ate for the first time at Angela Hartnett’s lovely Café Murano and realised that it occupies the same building at 36 Tavistock Street as Thomas De Quincey’s used to. As a diehard atheist I cannot use the language of ghosts. There is no afterlife. But there was something delightful about sitting in a dining room once occupied so often by my mother. Rooms can ring sweetly with silent echoes. Before it was Café Murano it was a branch of Sofra, for in big cities buildings often retain their essential purpose across decades. In the mid-19th century, for example, 160 Piccadilly, now home to the Wolseley, was a grand restaurant called the Wellington, where they served consommé au naturel, whitebait and pouding à la d’Orsay. Which brings me to 84 Rosebery Avenue in London’s Clerkenwell, not far from where this newspaper’s offices were once located. It has been a series of pizzerias in recent years and before that was a Chez Gérard, which served me very serviceable steak frites. Long before that it was, like so many of London’s great dining rooms, a bank; their underlying architecture suits the modern business of tables, chairs and food. The buildings stay the same. Only the restaurants change. And so I return once more to 84 Rosebery Avenue, which now has the words Double Dragon affixed above the door in bright red neon. Perhaps it’s a reference to the Japanese-made video game, featuring martial arts masters Billy and Jimmy Lee fighting their way through a dystopian New York. I’m not certain, but don’t investigate the term on urbandictionary.com, unless you have a strong constitution; the definitions run from the deeply scatological to the profoundly rude. Either way, it’s described as an extended pop-up that might well become permanent, and belongs to Australian chef Scott Hallsworth. He was once head chef at Nobu London before going it alone with his particularly raucous brand of Asian-inspired, miso-slicked, ponzu-dribbled crowd-pleasing boom and blast. He opened Kurobuta, before selling up and opening Freak Scene. That closed during the pandemic. The website describes this new venture as an izakaya, serving food to go with drinks. I can attest that the food goes very well with drinks. The menu on the current website is lengthy. There’s an enticing section of wood-fired dishes, utilising the oven left behind by the pizzerias. A little disappointingly, the menu currently on offer is shorter and feels like edited highlights. Shame. I very much liked the sound of the kombu roasted sea bass with spicy shiso ponzu, and the wood-fired jumbo prawns with spicy lemon dressing. That said, all the things they are serving very much do the Hallsworth jazz hands thing of parading on to the table and slapping you repeatedly about the chops. When I last ate his food at Kurobuta I whined that, however much I liked his cooking, it was expensive. This iteration is much better value. There’s also a pleasing restlessness to it. We start with a generous £5 dish of Padrón peppers, roasted in the wood-fired oven, sprinkled with sesame seeds and swamped with a mustard miso and lemon dressing. Padrón peppers in gravy: this should always be a thing. The nasu dengaku, or aubergine grilled with a miso glaze, is as good here as I recall it from Kurobuta and comes with the added joy of a candied walnut rubble. Be sure to order the crisp glazed pork belly, in soft folds of doughy bun, with the sticky soy and peanut sauce and house pickles. The fanciest dish is a couple of perfectly cooked, glazed scallops with a yuzu truffle sauce. It’s a hollandaise that’s been on its travels. One observation: it is hard to eat a whole scallop with chopsticks while looking elegant. Perhaps they could slice them in two. Or I could abandon the redundant notion of elegance. In an echo of his Nobu days, but at a fraction of the price, there’s a salmon sashimi “pizza” for £10.50, served on a disc of golden, bubbled cracker with truffle-ponzu and wasabi fish roe. Texturally, it’s a joy, but at first lacks sprightliness. No matter; after last week’s buttered hispi cabbage, here is the great brassica scorched once again in big leaves with an invigorating ponzu, beurre noisette and dried miso dressing. A few drops of that on the salmon sashimi and it comes alive. We also use it as a dipping sauce for well-made spicy tuna maki rolls. These are described as “roulette” because one has been spiked with a seriously hot sauce. It comes with a shot of cucumber sake for whoever pulls the gastronomic trigger. This is of, course, very silly but, like so much here, it’s also an awful lot of fun. There are just two desserts: a chocolate mousse with a coconut ice-cream and a cheesecake with blueberries and a Speculoos crumb. Both are served in glasses and amount to the same idea: creamy things piled on top of each other. They do the job. You can have a look at my pictures of these dishes on Instagram where I am @jayrayner1, but be aware that serious effort was required to make them work. The cream-coloured dining room with its open kitchen is bathed at night in a neon electric purple light which drains out colours. The iPhone torch had to be pushed into service to get a reasonable shot. Expect to see a lot of those torches on display here, because if ever food was made for social media this is it. For once, I mean that in a good way. Not every restaurant has to be profound. Not every restaurant has to be classy. Sometimes it can just be a great night out. Double Dragon has turned what was once home to many a sedate restaurant, into exactly that. Industry body UKHospitality has called for the expansion of pavement licences, a feature of the pandemic, to be made permanent. The scheme, which was introduced last April and is due to expire in September, enabled restaurants to maintain their business despite restrictions introduced to stop the spread of Covid-19. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of the group, points out that the programme, helped by caps on application fees, has driven innovation and revenue for a sector sorely in need of help, and has also invigorated city centres. A 2016 semi-finalist on MasterChef: The Professionals has been hired to head up the kitchen of a new bar and brasserie in Harrogate. Josh Whitehead, formerly the executive chef at the Harewood Estate in Leeds, has put together a menu celebrating ‘exceptional British produce’ for the 180-cover restaurant, located on Cheltenham Crescent. It will open later this month, visit samsonsrestaurant.com. In an attempt to bolster its lunchtime trade, Pizza Express has launched a range of what they are calling ‘pizza wraps’ which, with their cardboard packaging, look much like a savoury version of a McDonald’s apple pie. The products, which are just under 600 calories each, come in five versions echoing the chain’s classic pizzas, including the American Hot, the Padana and the Pollo ad Astra. Currently they are available for take away and delivery and cost £9.50 with a salad. At pizzaexpress.com.

3/13/2022,"The war in Ukraine has entered its third week, yet still Russia’s once vaunted armed forces are struggling to control much of the country. These blundering heirs to the Red Army are said to be tightening their grip on Kyiv, but the outcome remains deeply uncertain. The aura of invincibility that once enveloped Russia’s military is destroyed. Its reputation lies in ruins amid the rubble of invasion. Frustration over the slow pace of advance has led to a change in tactics. Instead of directly engaging the resistance, the Russians have besieged major cities and taken to long-range shelling and bombing by artillery, missiles and air strikes. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy says more Ukrainian civilians than soldiers are being killed as a result. This cowardly, reckless policy has inevitably led to atrocities, such as last week’s lethal attack on a maternity hospital in Mariupol. That vile act and the often repeated, deliberate, indiscriminate targeting of civilian areas and the humanitarian corridors supposedly protected by local ceasefires self-evidently constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity. Compounding its offence, Russia has resorted to the use in urban areas of mass-casualty weapons such as cluster munitions, which scatter hundreds of small, delayed-action bomblets. The UK’s Ministry of Defence alleges Russia is also firing thermobaric rockets, known as vacuum bombs, which suck oxygen from the air (and people’s lungs) to generate an explosion. This barbaric approach to fighting, previously seen in Chechnya and Syria’s civil war, and Russia’s unprovoked war of aggression breach international law as codified in 1949 by the Geneva Conventions and the UN charter, and upheld, in theory, by the UN security council and the international court of justice in The Hague. It is vitally important, as was the case in Syria and before that in Bosnia, that the UN, western governments and human rights groups gather evidence and records of Russian actions in order that political leaders with “command responsibility” and soldiers on the ground may be held to account. Prosecutors at the international criminal court have already begun this process. Many of the organisational and logistical difficulties facing the invaders are of their own making. Contradicting President Vladimir Putin’s denials, Moscow now admits inexperienced, ill-trained conscripts have been thrown into battle. Thousands have died. This is another crime – committed by Putin against his own people. Yet it is the valiant, unexpectedly effective resistance mounted by Ukraine’s armed forces and civilian volunteers that has caused the biggest problems for Russian troops. They were told by Kremlin propagandists they would be welcomed as liberators. The opposite is happening. Putin’s big lie, that Ukrainians lack freedom, is exploded. Instead, they are fighting to be free of him. Putin’s frustration and impatience now appear to be taking an even more sinister turn. Western officials warned last week that, judging by its previous actions in Syria and recent intelligence, Russia could soon resort to illegal use of non-conventional weapons – meaning chemical, biological or low-yield, tactical nuclear weapons – to break Ukraine’s resistance. Chemical weapons, notably the sarin nerve agent and chlorine gas, delivered by rockets or dropped as bombs, were repeatedly used against Syrian civilians. In Ghouta, outside Damascus, as many as 1,700 people died in sarin attacks in 2013. The Syrian and Russian governments denied responsibility and described the atrocity as an opposition “false flag” operation to discredit them. US and British officials fear history may be repeating itself following fabricated claims by the Kremlin, irresponsibly repeated by China, that the US is secretly operating bio-weapons laboratories in Ukraine. Russia is now suggesting any release, deliberate or accidental, of chemical or biological agents during the fighting would thus be America’s fault. The fear is that the convoluted lies at the heart of this latest “false flag” operation are intended to obscure the imminent use of banned chemical or biological weapons by Russia itself. The terrible injuries to victims aside, such weapons have proven capacity to terrorise entire populations. This is their true value to a mass killer such as Putin, desperate to prevail by any means. However deluded or crazed he may be, Putin must be made to understand how unacceptable any such escalation would be. Possibly he recalls Barack Obama’s lamentable failure in 2013, after the Ghouta attack, to impose the “enormous consequences” he had threatened if his “red line” opposing chemical weapons use was crossed. Possibly Putin thinks the west will bottle it again. Boris Johnson and Joe Biden evidently remember the “red line” fiasco, too. While expressing grave concern, Britain and the US have refused to say exactly what action, if any, they might take. That’s sensible, for now. We must hope that Putin is being told in no uncertain terms, through diplomatic back channels and perhaps by France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, who still talks to him, that he goes down this path at his utmost peril. It’s plain that war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide are being committed daily by Russia. All those responsible should understand they will be held to account, however long it takes.

3/13/2022,"The questions Just over 20 years ago, I fell truly and madly for a girl, N. We circled around each other for a summer, but never got together. We did acknowledge our attraction, but were both due to start university. After a kiss, we agreed it was bad timing. Out of fear of rejection, I never told her how deep my feelings went. We saw each other on university holidays, and an affinity remained, however she quickly appeared to move on. I pined for her deeply. No one I met compared. Long sessions of listening-to-depressing-love-songs-type stuff. I eventually ended up in a relationship. This was fine. It felt like moving on, until N and I got together one drunken evening. Afterwards, we agreed it was a mistake and carried on with our lives. I ended the relationship I was in. We met a few times over the next few years, but slowly lost touch. I met a wonderful person and got married and have incredible kids. I am very much in love with my wife. My thoughts of my first love remained affectionate, but in a platonic and sporadic way. I recently found out that N has died, leaving behind a family. The strength of my reaction has taken me by surprise. I have been completely floored by it and cannot stop thinking of her. I find my mind going to what I could and should have said more 20 years ago. I have only passingly discussed this with my wife, and not my inner thoughts, as I fear it sounds over-the-top and a betrayal to her. How do I rationalise the strength of these feelings I thought I had left behind 15 years ago? I just want to remember N fondly, as she deserves to be remembered. Philippa’s answer I see it like this: you still have that teenage boy inside you, even though you are now a happily married middle-aged man. You need to be very kind to this lovelorn boy: he believes he has just lost the love of his life, he needs to weep and he needs to be held. Luckily, you have a lovely person on-hand to help you with this. You’ve just got to talk to her. Parts of ourselves don’t die just because we move on, they remain dormant until something reignites them. Old men on their deathbeds call for their mothers and you cannot but feel deeply for them. There is a hint in your email that you might be worried about part of you being unacceptable to others. You seem to have some sort of belief that says something like, “If you really knew me, you would not approve of me.” And it seems to me that this might have been part of what held you back from being truly open with N, and now I’m wondering if you are projecting this belief on to your wife. There are lines in your letter that suggest you love your life, and that you love your wife, and because you say things like you thought about N “in a platonic and sporadic way”, I would guess your wife would not be offended if you showed her the email you wrote to me. Maybe even show her my reply, too, because I would think she might be a good person to facilitate your grieving. There are feelings that are difficult to rationalise. That doesn’t mean they don’t make sense. What is wonderful about the bonds we create is that they can go beyond words and this is possibly why we keep trying to articulate such feelings in poetry and love songs. You sound like a rational person, so something you cannot make sense of might feel like a sort of craziness, but I don’t think it is. You certainly did have unfinished business with N; there were things you felt that you didn’t say. You kept those things close to your chest. I think you need to hear them, whatever they were. There’s a school of therapy founded by Fritz and Laura Perls called Gestalt therapy. A commonly used Gestalt intervention is to put two chairs out. One for you and one that remains empty for the person with whom you have unfinished business. And, daft as it sounds, you tell that chair that represents the missing person everything you need to say to them, out loud. Then – and this is the clever bit – you sit in their empty chair and be them, and respond to your empty chair, what you imagine they would say back to you. If I was your therapist I might prescribe that you do this twice a week for four weeks, and see if you don’t move past what is making you feel stuck with this. You are grieving and so this exercise would help you cathartically release your tears, which you probably need to do. If you want to do this work with a Gestalt therapist there is a directory at gpti.org.uk. A first love may not be mature love, but they can be a catalyst in teaching you how you love and helping you to know who you are. You can be expected to feel utterly devastated when their life is cut cruelly short. I am very sorry for your loss.

3/13/2022,"I used to believe several things about the 21st century that Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and Donald Trump’s election in 2016 have shown me are false. I assumed: Nationalism is disappearing. I expected globalization would blur borders, create economic interdependence among nations and regions and extend a modern consumer and artistic culture worldwide. I was wrong. Both Putin and Trump have exploited xenophobic nationalism to build their power. (Putin’s aggression has also ignited an inspiring patriotism in Ukraine.) Nations can no longer control what their citizens know. I assumed that emerging digital technologies, including the internet, would make it impossible to control worldwide flows of information and knowledge. Tyrants could no longer keep their people in the dark or hoodwink them with propaganda. Wrong again. Trump filled the media with lies, as has Putin. Putin has also cut off Russian citizens from the truth about what’s occurring in Ukraine. Advanced nations will no longer war over geographic territory. I thought that in the “new economy”, land was becoming less valuable than technological knowhow and innovation. Competition among nations would therefore be over the development of cutting-edge inventions. I was only partly right. While skills and innovation are critical, land still provides access to critical raw materials and buffers against potential foreign aggressors. Major nuclear powers will never risk war against each other because of the certainty of “mutually assured destruction”. I bought the conventional wisdom that nuclear war was unthinkable. I fear I was wrong. Putin is now resorting to dangerous nuclear brinksmanship. Civilization will never again be held hostage by crazy isolated men with the power to wreak havoc. I assumed this was a phenomenon of the 20th century and that 21st-century governments, even totalitarian ones, would constrain tyrants. Trump and Putin have convinced me I was mistaken. Advances in warfare, such as cyber-warfare and precision weapons, will minimize civilian casualties. I was persuaded by specialists in defense strategy that it no longer made sense for sophisticated powers to target civilians. Utterly wrong. Civilian casualties in Ukraine are mounting. Democracy is inevitable. I formed this belief in the early 1990s, when the Soviet Union had imploded and China was still poor. It seemed to me that totalitarian regimes didn’t stand a chance in the new technologically driven, globalized world. Sure, petty dictatorships would remain in some retrograde regions of the world. But modernity came with democracy, and democracy with modernity. Both Trump and Putin have shown how wrong I was on this, too. Meanwhile, Ukrainians are showing that Trump’s and Putin’s efforts to turn back the clock on the 21st century can only be addressed with a democracy powerful enough to counteract autocrats like them. They are also displaying with inspiring clarity that democracy cannot be taken for granted. Democracy is not a spectator sport. It’s not what governments do. Democracy is what people do. Ukrainians are reminding us that democracy survives only if people are willing to sacrifice for it. Some sacrifices are smaller than others. You may have to stand in line for hours to vote, as did tens of thousands of Black people in America’s 2020 election. You may have to march and protest and even risk your life so others may vote, as did iconic civil rights leaders like the late John Lewis and Martin Luther King. You may have to knock on hundreds of doors to get out the vote. Or organize thousands to make your voices heard. And stand up against the powerful who don’t want your voices heard. You may have to fight a war to protect democracy from those who would destroy it. The people of Ukraine are also reminding us that democracy is the single most important legacy we have inherited from previous generations who strengthened it and who risked their lives to preserve it. It will be the most significant legacy we leave to future generations – unless we allow it to be suppressed by those who fear it, or we become too complacent to care. Putin and Trump have convinced me I was wrong about how far we had come in the 21st century. Technology, globalization and modern systems of governance haven’t altered the ways of tyranny. But I, like millions of others around the world, have been inspired by the Ukrainian people – who are reteaching us lessons we once knew.
