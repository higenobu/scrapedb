5/15/2022,"Britain’s hard-pressed households could feel even worse done by this week when official inflation figures show just how fast the cost of living is rising. Economists are forecasting a jump from March’s 7% to 9.1% in April. If the pundits are right, the consumer prices index will be at its highest level since 1990, when the UK was struggling with one of its worst postwar property slumps and a full-blown recession. Not that families need telling – disposable incomes across the country have been hit hard. The price of unleaded petrol may have steadied at between £1.60 and £1.70 in the past month, but energy bills and food prices are soaring across the board. James Knightley and James Smith, economists at ING, said the month-on-month rise would reflect a 54% jump in household gas and electricity bills since the beginning of April, following regulator Ofgem’s lifting of energy price cap. The Bank of England, citing rising energy costs, has forecast a rise in inflation to above 10% after the summer. “We are less sure that it will get as bad as that, but then again inflation has consistently surprised to the upside,” it said in a statement. Data on the jobs market will be published on Tuesday, a day before the inflation figures. Central bank officials are most worried by increases in wages over the past few months of about 5.4%, and the extent to which workers will demand increases in their monthly earnings to keep pace with rising inflation over the next year. This is the much-feared precursor to a wage/price spiral that could push inflation higher for years to come. Some members of the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) believe wage demands could rocket – and that employers will be forced to push up prices to recoup the higher costs of production – not just this year, but next year too, and possibly through into 2024. But at least two of the nine-strong committee indicated at their meeting earlier this month that they believed the opposite – that wages growth had already plateaued. However, Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies thinktank, believes the tightness of the labour market will keep wage growth robust. The UK has record levels of vacancies and a rising proportion of staff moving jobs – which makes it difficult for employers to fill vacant posts. However, hundreds of thousands of firms are operating with very slim profit margins and know that their customers are tightening their belts: this limits their scope to pay higher wages. These firms are likely to cut back production or reduce the level of service rather than raise prices. “A restaurant is more likely to stop opening at lunchtimes than take on a second chef on much higher wages,” Wilson said. Unemployment is forecast to remain low, at 3.8% – the same as the previous month – though this figure is flattered by the 500,000 workers, mostly over-50s, who have quit the labour market in the past 18 months. And since 2019, the Brexit effect has denied employers some 500,000 foreign nationals who had been expected to become active in the UK labour market. This combined million-worker gap was important when trying to explain the state of the UK jobs market compared with other similar-sized economies, said Wilson. For instance, in France, where the participation rate through the pandemic has stayed the same, there is no loss of skilled workers and wages remain in check. Wilson said the government should focus its efforts on helping those who had become economically inactive to return to work. Instead the only policy action is over at the Bank, where there is talk of interest-rate rises to quell inflation when the MPC meets in June and August. However Paul Dales, chief UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said his forecast that the base rate could rise from 1% to as high as 3% now looked in danger of being overly aggressive. One overriding factor is the prospect of a recession. The economy contracted by 0.1% in March after flatlining in February. A recession may already be brewing.",News/Business,Back to the bad old days of the 1990s as recession looms for UK,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/15/1990s-recession-looms--uk-inflation-rises
5/15/2022,"Australians over the age of 55 will be able to plow $300,000 into superannuation from the sale of their home, under a policy announced ahead of the Coalition campaign launch. On Sunday Scott Morrison announced that up to 1.3m more empty nesters and pensioners would be able to access incentives that are designed to help people downsize to improve housing supply. However, downsizer rules do not require people who sell to purchase a smaller home, meaning the measure is in effect a further non-concessional boost to super for those who sell their primary residence if they have owned for 10 or more years. Under current rules, over-65s are restricted from making large lump sum contributions to super. The age for downsizer contributions was already set to fall to 60 on 1 July. The Coalition has also pledged to double the amount of time pensioners have to structure their assets after sale of a home to two years, at a cost of $62m over four years. That measure will take effect from 1 January. About 1.9m aged pensioners are homeowners who are eligible. On Sunday Morrison will officially launch the Coalition campaign in Brisbane, just six days out from the election. Trailing 54% to 46% in two-party preferred terms in the latest Newspoll, Morrison’s campaign is flagging in the home stretch after Anthony Albanese’s early campaign gaffes over key economic indicators gave the Coalition renewed hope of a fourth term. On Friday Morrison attempted a campaign pivot, suggesting that the Covid-19 pandemic and negotiating security agreements in the last term of government had required him to be “a bit of a bulldozer” but things would “change” if re-elected. Morrison is yet to outline a specific program of what can or needs to change. At a press conference in Ringwood on Saturday, Morrison answered a question on that point with a homily about how the “Morrison men … go in and fix things” without being aware of unspecified “sensitivities”. Morrison then listed investments the government had made in flood recovery and women’s safety, but did not specify any new policy direction for the government. “I will seek to … explain my motives and my concerns and empathise a lot more. But I tell you what, at the end of the day, what matters most is I get the job done.” Morrison said he had waited until the later stage of the campaign to promise change because “over the course of the last two years, we’ve been all locked up in Canberra” and the government had been dealing with “existential crises”. On Sunday, Morrison said the housing policy changes would give “Australians more choice to decide how they want to live the next stage of their life by removing financial barriers for people wanting to downsize their home”. “By removing barriers for Australians downsizing to residences that better suit their needs and lifestyle, we are helping to free up larger homes for younger families.” The minister for superannuation, Jane Hume, said: “This is another in a line of reforms to make super more flexible when you need it most.”",News/Australia news," Coalition announces $300,000 super concession for over-55s who sell home",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/15/australian-federal-election-2022-scott-morrison-anthony-albanese-coalition-liberal-party-superannuation-housing-campaign-launch
5/15/2022,"Ukraine has won the 66th Eurovision song contest, which was held on Saturday evening in Turin in Italy. Riding a tidal wave of support from the telephone-voting European public, Stefania by Kalush Orchestra finished first after strong showings by the United Kingdom, Spain and Sweden in the early voting. “Please help Ukraine, Mariupol. Help Azovstal right now,” lead singer Oleh Psiuk shouted from the front of the stage after the band had performed. In a video address released before the event, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he believed the Kalush Orchestra would win. “Europe, vote for Kalush Orchestra. Let’s support our fellow countrymen! Let’s support Ukraine!” he said. The winning song, which mixes rap with elements of Ukrainian folk music, was originally written in honour of the group’s mothers. The group have subsequently rededicated it to all matriarchs in Ukraine, as lines such as “I’ll always find my way home, even if all roads are destroyed” found new resonance. The six men who make up the group had to receive special permits to leave Ukraine and travel to Italy during the war. Sam Ryder’s entry for the UK, Space Man, led at the halfway point, having won the jury vote from around Europe with 283 points. But after the points from the public vote were added, it finished second. Before the event, Ryder had said he wasn’t concerned where he finished, saying “This is something that celebrates inclusivity, expression, love, peace, joy, togetherness. And so to think about the scoreboard, for me, takes a bit of the shine and the magic out of the room entirely.” One of the night’s most notable performances was Norway’s Subwoolfer with Give That Wolf A Banana. The anonymous duo, known only under their pseudonyms Jim and Keith, performed in yellow wolf masks with the chorus pleading “Before that wolf eats my grandma / give that wolf a banana”. Goth-rock band the Rasmus, internationally known for their 2003 hit In the shadows, sung for Finland, while Australia’s Sheldon Riley wore the night’s heaviest costume, weighing more than 40kg. Serbia’s song In Corpore San featured a veiled critique of Serbia’s healthcare system, with artist Konstrikta washing her hands on stage while asking “What is the secret of Meghan Markle’s healthy hair?’ Russia did not compete, having been excluded by the organiser, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), on account of the invasion of Ukraine which began on 24 February. Ewan Spence from the Eurovision Insight Podcast told the Guardian from Turin that “throughout the week, the singers, the broadcasters, the community have proudly stood with Kalush Orchestra and Ukraine. This will always stand as a victory at Eurovision; but it means so much more. It is the grandest gesture of love to the people of Ukraine from every single corner of every single country in Europe and beyond.” Ukraine first appeared in the Eurovision song contest in 2003, and had won it twice, with Wild Dances by Ruslana in 2004 and the song 1944 by Jamala in 2016. The latter caused controversy as the subject of the song was the deportation of the Crimean Tatars in the 1940s by Joseph Stalin’s Soviet Union for alleged collaboration with the Nazis during the second world war. It was sung in English and Crimean Tatar, and came two years after the Russian Federation had annexed Crimea after the 2014 invasion. There was the usual dash of controversy at this year’s contest too. North Macedonia’s national broadcaster threatened to pull out after its act, Andrea, was accused of disrespecting the national flag by appearing to throw it to the ground. She issued an apology explaining that she had been trying to throw it across to a member of her team who was too far away to catch it. Organisers censored the song Eat Your Salad by Latvia’s Citi Zēni. The protest song in favour of going green included the line: “Instead of meat, I eat veggies and pussy.” With the EBU insisting the word “pussy” was dropped, Eurovision audiences had taken to shouting it out loud and clear. The song failed to qualify from Tuesday’s semi-final, avoiding an awkward pre-watershed moment for broadcasters across the continent. There were also complications on the stage. A hi-tech element named the “kinetic sun” was supposed to revolve, allowing acts to use either a giant LED screen or a wall of lights. The mechanism for switching it proved not to be fast enough, leaving some acts scrambling just days before the contest to readjust how they presented their songs. Despite the UK finishing second, Ukraine’s victory does still give the BBC a glimmer of hope of staging the event again for the first time since 1998. Traditionally the winner of the show hosts it the following year, but given the current situation in Ukraine, the EBU may be cautious of planning for an event in a year’s time in Kyiv. The 2023 host will most likely be chosen from one of the so-called “big five” countries who contribute the most to Eurovision coffers and who are guaranteed direct entry into the final: France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK.",Arts/Television & radio,Ukraine wins 2022 Eurovision song contest as UK finishes second in Turin,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/15/ukraine-wins-2022-eurovision-song-contest-as-uk-finishes-second-in-turin
