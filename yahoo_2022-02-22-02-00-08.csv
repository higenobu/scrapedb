2/22/2022,"A Wells Fargo executive said drug testing for marijuana is causing a shortage of truck drivers. As more states move to legalize cannabis, standards for drug testing truckers have become more stringent. As of December, over 60,000 truckers have been temporarily taken off the road for testing positive for marijuana use. While the grueling lifestyle and aging workforce has led to a national shortage of truck drivers, a Wells Fargo executive believes there's another issue exacerbating the labor crunch — marijuana testing. According to Chris Harvey, Wells Fargo's head of equity strategy, drug screenings paired with the nature of the job — which often requires truckers to spend weeks-on-end away from home — has led many truck drivers to leave the industry. Harvey said the issue will ""continue to push that price even higher,"" worsening a surge in transportation costs that have left consumers facing price hikes and shortages. ""It's really about drug testing,"" Harvey said, speaking at an industry conference on Wednesday. ""We've legalized marijuana in some states but, obviously, not all ... What we've done is we're excluding a significant portion of that trucker industry."" The role of marijuana testing in employee screening has been under debate in recent years, especially as the labor shortage continues to place more power in the hands of workers. At the same time, marijuana use has become more accepted: Last year, a Gallup poll of consumer habits found that 49% of US adults have used the drug at least once. To date, 37 states have legalized the use of cannabis for medical purposes, while 18 have cleared the substance for recreational use. But, in recent years, the trucking industry's drug policies have become even more stringent. Truck drivers are randomly drug tested on a quarterly basis, as well as in the event of an accident or traffic ticket, according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. Drivers that test positive are immediately removed from driving commercial motor vehicles, per the FMCSA. In 2020, the trucking industry implemented a law that required all truck drivers who had failed a drug test to be listed in a federal database so that other trucking companies would avoid hiring the drivers. Previously, drivers could theoretically move to a new company that would not have knowledge of the positive drug test. The law has impacted nearly 110,000 truckers, about 56% of which were reported for marijuana use, according to government data from December 2021. These 60,000 drivers who tested positive for marijuana use in the past two years could help plug the shortage of about 80,000 truckers that the American Trucking Association has reported. Since the database was launched, more than 6.4 million queries have been conducted on the site as of late December, as all employers must consult the database before they approve a new driver. As of December, more than 81,000 drivers were ""prohibited"" from work — over 75% of which had not begun the lengthy reassessment process required before they can return to duty.

2/22/2022,"Only days ago the U.S. approved a new package of arms sales to Taiwan. It included upgrades to Patriot air-defense missile systems. Now comes China's response. On Monday (February 21) Beijing said it was imposing sanctions on defense contractors Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. It's least the third time the country has penalised the firms, though no details were given of the latest measures. China said it had to act after the latest deal undermined ""peace and stability"" in the region. It regards the island as a breakaway province that must accept Chinese sovereignty. Beijing has never renounced the possibility of using force to achieve that goal. Over the past two years it has stepped up military and diplomatic pressure on the island's government. Now the effects of the sanctions may be largely symbolic, as the U.S. does not sell arms to China. However, Washington is legally bound to provide Taiwan with the means to self-defense, and its weapons sales always spark Chinese anger.",Politics/Reuters Videos,"China sanctions Lockheed Martin, Raytheon",https://news.yahoo.com/china-sanctions-lockheed-martin-raytheon-154637313.html
2/22/2022,"Candace Owens in a tweet Sunday said the US should deploy troops to Canada's trucker protests. Troops were needed ""to deal with the tyrannical reign of Justin Trudeau Castro,"" she said. Populists like Owens have sought to grow their audiences by stirring support for the truckers. Right-wing provocateur Candace Owens drew criticism Sunday for saying that the US should invade Canada in response to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's crackdown on the trucker protests there. ""STOP talking about Russia. Send American troops to Canada to deal with the tyrannical reign of Justin Trudeau Castro,"" wrote Owens, a supporter of Donald Trump known for stirring controversy online. ""He has fundamentally declared himself dictator and is waging war on innocent Canadian protesters and those who have supported them financially,"" she wrote of Trudeau. Some critics responded with mockery. ""One of the things I love about this dumb person is how literally no one of importance ever listens to her as she screams into the void,"" wrote Ben Domenech, a conservative commentator and the founder of The Federalist online magazine. —Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) February 20, 2022 However Joe Walsh, a radio host and anti-Trump Republican, said that her views shouldn't be so quickly dismissed. ""Candace Owens isn't fringe,"" he tweeted. ""If there's one takeaway from everything I say, it would be this: Candace Owens is not fringe, she's very much mainstream GOP base these days. And that's scary."" Her comments echo those of other right-wing populists in the US, including Fox News personalities and former President Donald Trump. They have spoken out in support of the truckers in Canada who've been protesting against a mandate requiring haulage workers making frequent cross-border trips to get vaccinated against COVID. The protests have been hailed as a stand against government overreach by Republicans, who've stirred support for the truckers and used the protests as a fund-raising cause.  They've attacked a crackdown on the protests by Trudeau, who has sought to freeze their funding and invoked emergency powers to restore order. At the same time, influencers like Owens have spoken out in support of Vladimir Putin's Russia as it menaces Ukraine with invasion. They have sought to lay the blame for Russian aggression with NATO, and opposed US involvement in the crisis.

2/22/2022,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's prime minister said on Monday a Chinese naval vessel that pointed a laser at an Australian military aircraft was so close to Australia's coast that it could have been seen from the shore, and urged a full Chinese investigation. Scott Morrison told media his government had not received an explanation from China over the incident last Thursday, which Australia considered ""dangerous and reckless"". China said Australia's version of events did ""not square up with facts"" and that Australia had dropped a Sonobuoy, which can help detect submarines, near Chinese ships. The Australian defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Chinese navy vessel directed a military-grade laser at an Australian military aircraft over Australia's northern approaches, illuminating the plane and potentially endangering lives, Australia said on Saturday. Such a laser is normally pointed to designate a target ahead of the discharging of a weapon. The P-8A Poseidon - a maritime patrol aircraft - detected a laser emanating from a People's Liberation Army – Navy (PLA-N) vessel, the Defence Department said, releasing photographs of two Chinese vessels sailing close to Australia's north coast. A Chinese guided missile destroyer and an amphibious transport dock were sailing east through the Arafura Sea between New Guinea and Australia at the time of the incident, and later passed through the narrow Torres Strait. ""It's possible people could even see the vessel from our mainland, potentially,"" Morrison told reporters in Tasmania on Monday. Australia had called through diplomatic and defence channels for ""a full investigation into this event"", he said. He compared the incident to a hypothetical situation of an Australian frigate pointing a laser at Chinese surveillance aircraft in the Taiwan Strait, adding: ""Could you imagine their reaction to that in Beijing?"" China's defence ministry defended the actions of its vessels, saying its vessels abided by international law and pinning any blame on Australia. ""The Australian P-8 anti-submarine patrol aircraft arrived in the airspace around our ship formation, and the nearest was only 4 kilometers away from our ship,"" defence ministry spokesman Tan Kefei said in a post on the ministry's official Weibo page published on Monday. ""From the photos taken by our ships, it can be seen that the Australian plane is very close to our ship and also drops Sonobuoys around our ship. Such malicious provocative behavior is very easy to lead to misunderstanding and misjudgment, posing a threat to the safety of ships and personnel on both sides,"" Tan added. Two Chinese defence ministry stamped photos, which could not be verified, were attached with the Weibo post. ""We demand that the Australian side immediately stop similar provocative and dangerous actions and stop making groundless accusations and smears against the Chinese side, so as not to affect the overall situation of relations between the two countries and two militaries,"" Tan said.
