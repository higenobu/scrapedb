4/24/2022,"The moment before all the flowers. When the grass begins to re-grow. When new life explodes. A piece then in praise of green. Of course, I love the giant cherry tree by the bus stop. I obsess over the buds as they unfurl. I wait impatiently for delicate clouds of whites and creams and pinks. Like Japanese sakura. I yearn for apple and pear blossom and – my favourite – quince. But the moment before everything springs is also dear to me. The edges of the towpath I walk to work on re-awaken. A cascade of vivid greens. The rampant spread of grasses, herbs, even weeds, coloured like Robin Hood in comics. The views from our windows are slowly transformed. The priory will soon be hidden behind the living wall of trees. Our walks over the heath are more intensely alive. Tree leaf, particularly, soft like newborn butterflies. A piece perhaps also in praise of quiet pots. Our white stellata flowers were stained by brick-red Saharan rain. Now almost all replaced by hoped-for hopeful leaf. The roses are pinked with fresh growth and bud. Everything impatient to express itself. The pots of early-scented white daffodil are fast headed towards flower. Later tulips hold back, patiently waiting their turn. The pheasant’s eye narcissi is yet to be seen. Whitsun lily, they call them in Denmark. This, then, is the time of leaf. The breathe-in before the exhale. There will be time enough for the spread of the yellows: the bright star-like celandine and dandelion. Time enough too for the early summer’s garden-centre shopping. For peat-free compost for refreshing pots. For all the colours, the annuals and perennials. For brighter pinks and reds and oranges. For geums and geraniums. Look around now. At roadside verges, at parklands and fields. Setting for hares and rabbits, homes for nesting skylarks. This is spring before the pomp. The quiet moments too easy to miss before they’re gone.

4/24/2022,"Yikouchi at Chancer’s Café, 1418 Pershore Road, Stirchley, Birmingham B30 2PH. No booking. All dishes £3.50-£9. Beers and wines from £4 a glass Yikouchi in Birmingham is a love letter. It is a sweet account of a young English couple’s interesting journey through life so far, served up one clamorous dish at a time. It’s an utter joy. Yikouchi, roughly pronounced ee-koh-chuh, is the beginning of an idiomatic Chinese saying that means “One mouthful won’t make you fat.” No, one mouthful won’t. But who wants just one mouthful when the food is this good? It belongs to James Kirk-Gould and his partner Cassie who, for six years, lived in Beijing, where they taught English and explored the local restaurants. In the way of capital cities, those restaurants represented the diverse cooking traditions of the country’s many provinces. Here was the chilli-spiked food of Sichuan and Hunan, the dishes of Dongbei and Shanghai. They moved on to Paris where the Chinese food did not scratch their highly developed itch, so James started cooking it for himself. They moved to London where James discovered that his amateur cookery chops were good enough to enable him to turn professional. He started in the kitchen at Duck & Waffle, eventually becoming head chef of the second Duck & Waffle near Piccadilly Circus. But now they had their first child, a pregnancy which had encouraged in Cassie such a profoundly sweet tooth she started making fudge (stay with me; these things will all tie up eventually). Off to the West Midlands they went in search of affordable housing. Cassie set up Sweetmeat Inc, a fudge-making business on the high street in Stirchley just to the south of Birmingham city centre. James took cheffing jobs, but also cooked his Chinese food at pop-ups. When the site of what had been a hairdresser’s right next door to the fudge business became available, they took it on and turned it into Chancer’s Café, a tiny space with a few high-top tables and a simple open kitchen, boasting just enough room for James and his 6ft 4in frame. It is two doors down from Eat Vietnam, a café with a big sign painted high on the outside wall that reads: “Fish Sauce Is Not For Everyone.” What goes on in Chancer’s Café may equally not be for everyone. But it is certainly for me. At the weekends they serve a brunch menu of beignet and waffles, often with fudge sauce. An awful lot of fudge sauce. But from Wednesday to Friday lunchtimes and on Friday evenings it becomes Yikouchi. Somehow, using only two portable induction hobs for his woks, James knocks out thrilling dishes paying homage to their time together in China. The menu is short, at barely more than half a dozen choices, none of which cost more than £9. Credit where it is due: I am here with the Birmingham-based writer Simon Carlo, whose funny, well-written, wide-ranging blog Meat & One Veg tipped me off to this brilliant cut-gem of a place. While he sips a £5.50 glass of cava, I set about ordering everything on the menu and one thing that isn’t on the menu. Mouth-watering chicken for £9 is a whole skinless chicken breast, pearlescent and creamy, served at room temperature in a golden bath of chilli oil, bobbing with numbing peppercorns and dressed with fronds of coriander and rings of spring onion. It does what the name suggests. It’s a honking wake-up. As is the tiger salad, a bright pile of more coriander, julienned cucumber and spring onions in a vinegary dressing. In between, we use our teeth to strip the beans from edamame pods served warm and salty. There are two stir-fries with rice. One is a big pile of shiny, hand-torn green cabbage leaves, with chunks of sautéed red chilli; the other is slices of pork, cooked up with the thrusting, assertive rush of Sichuan chilli paste, black beans and lots of fresh green peppers. This isn’t elegant food. It isn’t precise. It’s bold and rough around the edges and all the more beguiling for that. On Friday evenings, Carlo tells me, there are a couple more dishes on offer, including their fried chicken. As James is only just over the kitchen counter from me, I plead my case. As I’ve come so far for lunch, could he possibly knock some up? He agrees to do so. What arrives is an extraordinary bowl full of golden chunks of thigh in a crystalline batter that shatters beneath the teeth, splashed with more of the hefty, salty chilli oil. There’s lots of fried chicken about at the moment. Marinating, battering and deep-frying bird is now regarded by many kitchens as the crowd-pleaser of choice, but not all fried chicken is equal. Getting it right takes due care and attention. This is one of the best versions I’ve tried in a long time, and it’s only £9 a bowl. I try to hold a conversation while it sits next to us, but I am unequal to the task. I keep losing my thread, drawn back to that piece there and that piece over there, until every golden undulating, crispy chunk has gone and the bowl is empty. It’s true that one mouthful of this chicken won’t make you fat. But you won’t stop at one. For dessert there is only their soft-serve vanilla ice-cream from the machine at the back of the kitchen. For 50p they’ll give you a serving of one of their many fudge sauces: the salted or the Irish Cream or the vanilla and so on. It’s a sweet end to the meal in so many ways. My bill is modest so I add to it a bag of Cassie’s very good fudge, which picked up a brace of Great Taste Awards last year. There’s one narrative in which such a place sits oddly on a suburban shopping parade like that in Stirchley. Indeed, as my train pulled into nearby Bournville station, a local took one look at me, did a theatrical sharp intake of breath and said, “You’re not going to try and review somewhere here are you?” as if I was risking my life. And I thought I was meant to be the sour-faced metropolitan snob. Sure, the stretch of Pershore Road hosting Chancer’s Café is not exactly gilded and shiny. It’s just a real place, serving real people’s needs. There’s a barber’s and a solicitor’s, a couple of pizza parlours and, helpfully, somewhere that will let your trousers out. Now there’s also Yikouchi which, for an hour or so, will take you on a journey to somewhere else before depositing you back on the pavement. Enjoy the ride. The highly regarded chef Anthony Demetre of Wild Honey in London’s St James’s, is cooking a one off “spring social” charity dinner on 9 May at the Crossing, a pub and dining room in Barnes, southwest London. The menu includes Wye Valley asparagus with chopped poached egg and parsley vinaigrette, scallops with artichoke and vanilla and roast and slow cooked lamb with peas, broad beans and lovage. Tickets cost £65 per person and money raised will go to the Glass Door Homeless Shelter. To book call 0208 251 1244 (thecrossing-barnes.co.uk). Isle of Wight chef Robert Thompson has announced his next venture. He is to become the chef-patron of North House, a 14-bedroom boutique hotel and restaurant in Cowes, which is opening shortly. Thompson was awarded a Michelin star at the Hamborough on the island in 2006 when he was just 23, and in 2015 opened his first solo venture Thompson’s. The restaurant will serve both an à la carte and tasting menu (northhouseiow.com). Disappointing news from Sheffield. Juke and Loe, which I enjoyed very much when I reviewed it on this page only back in January, is to close after five years.

4/24/2022,"Twenty years ago, Britain was confronted with the horror of what can happen when the child protection system fails. Victoria Climbié, a “happy, smiling, enthusiastic little girl”, was tortured to death over a period of months by her relatives, in the worst-ever case of child abuse the professionals who investigated her death had seen. The government ordered an inquiry into how she was failed so monumentally by the professionals whose job it was to understand the danger she was in. Lord Laming, its chair, wrote that he hoped that the memory of Victoria would act as “a beacon pointing the way to securing the safety and wellbeing of all children in our society”. Many changes have been made in the years since that report was published. Yet children still lose their lives in the most horrific of circumstances as a result of abuse and neglect. Last year, convictions were secured for the dreadful murders of six-year-old Arthur Labinjo-Hughes and 16-month-old Star Hobson. Just in the last week, a court found that five-year-old Logan Mwangi had been murdered by his mother and stepfather, and the mother of seven-year-old Hakeem Hussain was convicted of his manslaughter. Logan suffered a “slow and painful death”, after months of abuse and being imprisoned in a dungeon-like bedroom. Hakeem endured abject neglect from a mother with a drug addiction problem and suffocated to death in freezing conditions during an asthma attack while she was high on drugs. Like Victoria, they all lost their lives as a result of serious failures in child protection. Logan’s teachers noticed worrying changes in his appearance and demeanour in the weeks before his death; social workers and the police knew of his injuries and of death threats against him from the teenager involved in his murder. His stepfather already had convictions for assaulting a child. Hakeem had been subject to a child protection plan before his death and a few days earlier a nurse at his school had predicted he would die if action was not taken to protect him; his three half-siblings had already been removed from his mother’s care. There were 206 serious safeguarding incidents that involved child deaths in England in 2020. Fifty-six of these deaths occurred as a result of filicide, physical abuse or cruelty or involved maltreatment. Child abuse and neglect are not one-off incidents, but patterns of behaviour that produce tell-tale signs that a child is at serious risk. More of these deaths should be preventable through a well-functioning child protection system. Resourcing has clearly been an issue in the past decade as a result of government cuts and rising costs, driven in large part by the privatisation of children’s care. It is much harder for a social worker to make accurate risk assessments when they are responsible for more than 30 children each, as they are in some areas. But it goes beyond insufficient resourcing. There is no decision more complex or intrusive that the state takes in relation to children than the point at which they should be taken into care. It is unbearably high stakes: leave a child in the care of abusive or neglectful parents and they may suffer terrible harm. It is made harder by social workers’ dual role. Their job is to support vulnerable families to provide the best environment possible for their children. But they are first and foremost an advocate for children, which can require them to investigate families and take tough decisions in the interests of children but not the parents they also care about. As the Laming inquiry highlighted, abusive parents can be highly deceptive when it comes to covering up the harm they cause their children and children have died in cases where social workers have been too ready to believe parents and focused on the parent’s need at the expense of the child’s. This makes children’s social work one of the most highly skilled and demanding of public service professions. We should be investing far more in training and developing the people whose responsibility it is to keep vulnerable children safe. Of course, it would be better if there were fewer children in care because more parents can care for their children safely. The experience of a local authority such as Leeds, which has reduced the number of children in care over a decade through providing support for at-risk families, show that this is possible, though it requires significant investment and outstanding leadership, scarce resources in a system where there are too many failing social services departments. But the cart cannot come before the horse. The evidence suggests that a timely move into care is associated with better outcomes for children at risk of neglect and abuse. Yet there is a dangerous narrative in some parts of children’s social care that the system is too quick to take children into care where there is no serious risk of harm. There is little evidence to suggest that this is the case, but one reason this sticks is because parents who feel they have been wrongly investigated by social services form a more powerful constituency with a louder voice than the children whose abuse and neglect is allowed to persist. The deaths of Hakeem Hussein and Logan Mwangi are the latest alarms that there is something seriously amiss with the child protection system in this country. Two decades after Victoria Climbié was murdered, we remain a long way from securing the safety and wellbeing of every child growing up in Britain.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on failures of the child protection system,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/24/observer-view-failures-of-child-proection-system
4/24/2022,"Parents spent less time reading, chatting and playing with their children during the pandemic, according to new research by the National Literacy Trust. A quarter said they did not chat with their child every day in 2021, compared with just 10% in 2019, and only half (53%) of parents said they were reading to their child daily, compared with two-thirds in 2019. And the proportion of parents who said they played with their child at least once a day in the previous week also fell from 76% in 2019 to 72% in 2021. The Trust surveyed more than 1,500 parents with children under five. Overall, the research found that fewer parents of young children engaged in “home learning activities” – reading, chatting, playing, singing or painting and drawing – in 2021, compared with 2019, despite spending more time in the home with their child due to the pandemic. Spokesperson Alison Tebbs said she thinks many parents struggled during the lockdowns to juggle full-time work with caring for children and supervising their learning. “It was such a difficult time for people,” she said. “There was less support for families, there was less socialisation happening, and beneficial activities like going to the park or library were often unable to take place.” Even parents who viewed early learning activities as important were only slightly more likely to do these activities than other parents, she said, suggesting some parents were constrained by their circumstances or a lack of stimulation. Reading with children and having conversations is vital for helping their brains develop, Tebbs said: “One of the reasons two-year-olds act out is because they’re trying to communicate feelings which they can’t explain verbally. That’s why you get tantrums. The more words they have, and the more support they get when they communicate, the more in touch they will be with their emotions and with the wider world.” Crystal Robinson, 29, and her two-year-old daughter Heidi live in a top-floor flat with no garden in Swindon. With her partner, Nick, at work, and no opportunities to go outside to playgrounds or outings, she relied on TV and toys. There sometimes seemed to be little need for Robinson to chat to her daughter. “I didn’t really know what to say to someone so small,” she said. “I’d speak to her about what I was doing. Like if I was doing some housework, I’d pick her up and say right, we’re going to wash the plates. But then I’d think: I don’t know why I’m saying this because she’s not listening.” Heidi rarely heard her mother talking to other people, since they weren’t socialising, and although Robinson did try reading a couple of books to her energetic toddler, “she seemed really uninterested”. When Heidi started nursery shortly after she turned two in September last year, she wasn’t speaking much at all. She and her mother were invited to participate in a programme called Early Words Together, developed by the National Literacy Trust to improve children’s communication and literacy development. A further roll-out of the programme is taking place this week, sponsored by the children’s channel Nick Jr. After weekly sessions with other parents, Robinson gained confidence communicating and reading with Heidi: “I’m constantly talking to her now.Heidi loves books now. And she never stops asking questions. She just doesn’t stop talking.” Vanessa Dooley, founder of Jigsaw Early Years Consultancy, carries out mock Ofsted inspections at nurseries and thinks “an absolutely massive” crisis is looming for schools following the pandemic. “I’ve seen some children who, instead of turning the pages of a book, swipe as if it’s an iPad. Others, at the age of three, are unable to put two words together in a sentence. By the time they get to school, they are going to be so behind.” In the past year, she has also seen many children having “outbursts” and biting and hitting other children. “Children are flipping their lids. They’re frustrated because they don’t know how to communicate what they’re feeling.” As a result, she worries children aren’t being taught how to regulate their emotions and that is going to have a knock-on effect when they start school. “They don’t know how to cope.” Demand for speech language therapists is very high at the moment, she says, and some children are being put on nine-month waiting lists. “Communication and language in children has taken a massive nosedive. And children are struggling.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Life in lockdown held back progress of under-fives,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/24/life-in-lockdown-held-back-progress-of-under-fives
4/24/2022,"The question As a retired woman living alone, I felt isolated during the various lockdowns. The answer seemed to be to rely on technology, which was fine when it worked, but it often made me feel more cut off from the world. For example, when I didn’t know how to unmute myself on a video call it was like having locked-in syndrome. Emerging from the pandemic, things are better, except Covid has made technology the way forward and I can’t always get it to work for me. I’ve been to a pub where I had to forgo lunch because I couldn’t order on the app. I know people who have gone abroad for holidays, but I’ve been too scared to go because of the passenger locator form, which you had to complete online while out of the country (how?). I have a mobile phone I often struggle with – for months I didn’t know how to answer a call, so I had to wait for people to ring off, then I had to call them back. If I buy a new device it doesn’t even come with a manual to show me how it works. I am drifting further apart from people who use their phones and watches (watches?!) for everything. I don’t feel I belong in this world. And this is unlikely to get better. Philippa’s answer I also find it a pain in the neck how we must increasingly rely upon technology. I can’t even work my own central heating system and you can’t pay your council tax without having to remember a password. When the internet first arrived, I was quite good, but nothing ever stays still; the word “upgrade” makes me shudder. I’ve got bored of watching YouTube videos trying to update myself. Younger people seem to fiddle and just get on with it intuitively: they’ve grown up with it. We haven’t. OK, rant over. What can we do about it? We can remember that learning something new is good for our older brains. And you must give yourself a pat on the back for getting your email to me. You are doing splendidly. You learned how to do that. You can learn more. I know it’s very boring and as soon as you get the hang of one video-conferencing app, they upgrade it, or your group starts to use a different programme and then you must learn it anew. You can do this, though. I can do it, too. We’ve got to. Go to the computer store. Yell, “SHOP!” (My dad – RIP – used to do this in Woolworths: he didn’t hold with self-service) until an assistant comes to you. Explain that you are from another planet, another generation and you need proper help. This will be hard for them to understand because they are fish and the technology is the water, but persevere. The brand that calls itself after a piece of fruit actually holds lessons in their store. They call them stores and not shops, I think, because they came over from that new-fangled country, America. Don’t budge until you get the help you need. Don’t stop short of bursting into tears. Let them have it. The great thing about being old is that we can say exactly how we feel and what we want and usually get away with it. I find I must ask for help more than once because I need to be told it a few times and practise it, before it goes in. But there is something else going on here. There is a part of you (and me, and all of us) destined to remain alone, unseen. This part is usually background – we don’t usually dwell on how only we truly know our own experience of existing. But I think it’s why we need art, fiction and films, because the people who make them are really trying and sometimes hit on something that puts an elusive inchoate feeling into language or images. I heard somewhere (don’t ask me to find the reference, I’ve lost it) that there is a tribe which when a child is born gives it the name that everyone will call it by, as well as a secret name only known to the child given by the elder of the tribe (who as they are an elder will die soon, so only the child will know it). That secret name stands for your special uniqueness and the part of you only known by you. Whatever and whoever that tribe is, they get it. Because of this feeling of it not being possible for our inner world to be truly known and seen by others, when asked, most people feel that they often believe themselves to be not in the centre of a group, but more towards the edges. And I imagine that if we don’t intuitively understand the new technology that we have increasingly come to rely on during the pandemic, it can exacerbate this feeling. If we manage to access this article online, I hope people will tell us how to go abroad and come back again in the comments (it’s beyond me, too, I’m looking forward to reading them). Although you feel you are left behind and destined to aloneness, you are not alone, there is an unseen, unknown part to all of us. We could give it a secret name if we liked. You do belong in this world, but a part of you may sometimes feel that you don’t.

4/24/2022,"Walking through the streets of Harlem in January, accompanied by partner A$AP Rocky and wearing an open coat to reveal her baby bump covered in jewels, Rihanna didn’t just tell the world she was pregnant. “She democratised the celebrity pregnancy reveal,” says Karen Hearn, curator of Portraying Pregnancy, a 2020 exhibition at the Foundling Museum in London. “The innovation was to make the announcement by going out with an obvious baby bump [wearing] clothing that accentuated that, and to be seen by as many people as possible,” adds Hearn, who is also an honorary professor at University College London. This article includes content provided by Instagram. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'. Rihanna’s Instagram post of this event, captioned “how the gang pulled up to black history month”, has been liked over 18m times. Working with stylist Jahleel Weaver, the star has continued to put her bump front and centre on social media feeds and in celebrity coverage. She has worn see-through lace lingerie to a fashion show, an organza gown to Jay-Z’s Oscars party, and boxer shorts and a robe out to dinner. The cover of April’s Vogue, released last week, is arguably the culmination of these looks – with Rihanna and bump starring in a red lace Alaia catsuit, photographed by Annie Leibovitz. Speaking to the Vogue journalist Chioma Nnadi, Rihanna said that centering the bump was always the plan. “I’m hoping that we were able to redefine what’s considered ‘decent’ for pregnant women,” she said. “My body is doing incredible things right now, and I’m not going to be ashamed of that. This time should feel celebratory. Because why should you be hiding your pregnancy?” In recent years, there have been many internet-breaking pregnancy “reveals” – Beyoncé and flower crown in 2017, for example, or Nicki Minaj’s bikini and platform heels in 2020. There have been red carpet moments – the much-memed Kim Kardashian in floral dress at the Met Ball in 2012, and singer MIA in polkadots at the Grammys in 2009. The naked baby bump, meanwhile, has been a trope in fashion since Demi Moore appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair in 1991. But what is different here is what Hearn calls an “accessibility”. Most of these looks are Rihanna’s everyday outfits – they aren’t part of a pre-approved photo shoot or dress-up moment. “When everyone was freaking out about her showing off her belly I just laughed,” says Sheena Ward, the editor of Rihanna fashion Instagram account, Haus of Rihanna. “This is Rihanna we’re talking about. Always a trendsetter, always a risk-taker, constantly pushing boundaries – of course she’s dressing this way.” The maternity wear market is worth $21.6b in 2021, and expected to reach $41.3bn by 2031. Inevitably, Rihanna is influencing trends. In March, Pinterest told Input that since she announced her pregnancy, searches for “lace maternity gown” are up 40% and lots of people have searched specifically for “Rihanna maternity style”. “She is pushing the concept of what a pregnancy wardrobe can include,” says Ashlee Neuman, content director at pregnancy site Thebump.com. “Up until now, crop tops, lowrise jeans and sheer fabrics haven’t been a mainstay of maternity wear.” If this trend for crop tops had been growing, Rihanna’s endorsement provided the tipping point. Ariane Goldman, the founder of the easy elegant maternity brand Hatch, says they had “a real lift in sales” when Rihanna wore their best-selling $38 Skin to Skin bra this month. “Now it just seems so relevant to have something where you can show your belly,” says Grace Kapin, the co-founder of Storq – a kind of Everlane of maternity wear. “Prior to this season, it just would have been much farther afield for somebody to imagine an everyday human [doing that].” Of course, most pregnant women don’t have a team creating bespoke outfits for their third trimester and many don’t have a smooth ride. “Not everybody is feeling great, and I don’t think anybody should feel the burden to show their body,” says Kapin. But a lot of Rihanna’s influence is less about clothes specifically, and more a change in mood. “She is pushing the idea that it’s OK to still enjoy the fashion styles you loved wearing prior to becoming pregnant,” adds Venesa Coger, style and culture specialist for Refinery29’s Unbothered. Vogue’s Chioma Nnadi argues that Rihanna’s approach to pregnancy has shifted perceptions of black motherhood: “For Black expectant mothers in particular, it stood as an awe-inspiring act of defiance,” she writes. The Cleveland based fashion historian and curator Darnell-Jamal Lisby agrees. He says that thanks to “historical tropes and stereotypes around Black mothers”, society does not see them as “capable of rising to the occasion of mothering”. Lisby also acknowledges that an added pressure comes from the responsibility Black families feel about “psychologically arming their children with protocol that will keep them safe in a world that historically negates Black lives”. Against this backdrop, Rihanna is a symbol of “a certain level of strength that define[s] the extraordinary essence of Black women”. That Rihanna’s pregnancy style has inspired such analysis speaks to the complicated history of pregnancy and style in the west. Women have hidden their pregnancy for centuries – first behind closed doors in confinement, and more recently in concealing clothing to hide a “condition” which was seen as embarrassing. Lucille Ball was the first celebrity to show her bump on TV in 1952; Jackie Kennedy wore empire-line tailoring for her public pregnancies; flowing dresses worked for more bohemian 60s types such as Yoko Ono and Jane Birkin. The 1980s saw Princess Diana and Fergie in strangely infantalising tent-like dresses but the decade also delivered a standout pregnancy fashion moment: singer Neneh Cherry on the British TV show Top of the Pops in 1988, seven months pregnant, and in a bodycon dress and bomber jacket. Yet pregnant women have been almost completely absent in fashion until recent years. New York’s Collina Strada, which has always had inclusive casting, has used pregnant models on the catwalk, as have labels including Eckhaus Latta and Nensi Dojaka. Model Slick Woods was nine months pregnant when she walked at Rihanna’s Savage Fenty show in 2018. Designer Dimitras Petsa featured multiple pregnant models in her fall collection, and she custom-made her stretchy “wet” dresses for Gigi Hadid and Nicki Minaj while they were pregnant. She says any controversy over exposing pregnant bodies is part of a wider problem: “A lot of fashion is unfortunately centred around making you look skinnier … and having a completely flat belly. Being pregnant is the complete antithesis of that.” Rihanna’s pregnancy style, she argues, is another chapter in the star’s promotion of body positivity. “If you look at her style before she was even pregnant, like you can see that her body actually has fluctuated a lot over the years,” says Petsa. “She has never tried to go against that … I really love that about her.” Of course, the other sector relevant here is children’s wear – with the global market estimated at $202.7b in 2022. When Rihanna and A$AP Rocky’s baby is born, what they wear will be highly anticipated. “I know that baby will probably be one of the best dressed babies of this century,” says Lisby. “I would be shocked if it was anything less than red carpet-ready Instagram posts.” Is a Fenty Baby line only a matter of time? “I can definitely see that happening in the future,” says Haus of Rihanna’s Ward. “You can tell Rihanna really loves kids. I could see her getting inspiration from dressing her own child to create a baby line and further expand her empire.”",Arts/Music,‘A symbol of strength’: how Rihanna’s bump has changed pregnancy style,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/24/how-rihanna-changed-pregnancy-style-maternity-wear
4/24/2022,"Meta experienced a historic nosedive in value earlier this year amid a major rebrand and shake-ups to its business model – and investors are bracing for another difficult quarter. Meta lost a record $230bn in market value after a disappointing earnings report in February, in which it revealed Facebook had recorded its first-ever drop in daily user numbers. While investors will be eagerly watching Meta’s first quarter report on Wednesday for signs of recovery, a “full turnaround is not expected”, said Debra Williamson, principal analyst at market research firm Insider Intelligence. “It is going to be slow progress for Meta after its massive stock decline last quarter,” she said. “But we – and advertisers in particular – are hoping to see some progress.” Meta’s struggle was not completely unexpected: chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg had warned that new privacy rules from Apple could cost the company $10bn in lost sales this year. The regulations prevent Meta from collecting certain user data and have prompted the company to shift some of its core advertising business models. One such shift is placing substantial emphasis on Reels, its shortform video content that it has yet struggled to monetize. The company warned in last quarter’s report that year-over-year growth could continue to be affected in the first quarter of 2022 by these issues. “We expect continued headwinds from both increased competition for people’s time and a shift of engagement within our apps towards video surfaces like Reels, which monetize at lower rates than Feed and Stories,” said the CFO, David Wehner, in a guidance statement. Meta’s pivot to video represents an effort to retain young users – a key advertising demographic that has been leaving Facebook and Instagram in droves. The age group provides 97% of Meta’s revenue, documents leaked by the company whistleblower Frances Haugen have shown, but is being lured to competitors like TikTok. Meta has a “formidable competitor in TikTok”, said Williamson, and has yet to create a sustainable business model in response. “They said last quarter they were going to figure out how to better monetize Reels,” she said. “This quarter, we are looking for signs that is actually happening.” Meanwhile, the company’s proprietary virtual reality platform, the Metaverse, is sucking away large amounts of funding from core businesses such as Facebook and Instagram. Meta funneled $10bn in funding into the platform in 2021 alone – more than 10 times what it paid to acquire Instagram in 2012. The Metaverse faces a long road to profitability, said Raj Shah, an analyst at consultancy firm Publicis Sapient. Successful monetization often requires a critical mass of users – Facebook, for example, has nearly 3 billion. But its Metaverse brand Horizon World currently has just 30,000 worldwide. “We see no reason to believe that this quarter for Meta will be significantly different than last,” he said. “Meta has announced new monetization schemes for its Metaverse investments, but adoption is still low.” User numbers are critical to Meta’s success – and a historic loss in users on its Facebook platform was one of the most impactful takeaways from its 2021 fourth quarter report. That loss underscored that Meta’s biggest short-term challenge is to stem the decline in usage, Williamson said. “This was a wake-up call to the market and also to the advertising community that this is a platform that is flattening – it is not the sexy, bright shiny object any more,” she said. User numbers will probably be further hit by bans of Meta products in Russia – where it hosted millions of users – amid its ongoing war with Ukraine, said Martin Garner, COO at market research firm CCS Insight. The country blocked Facebook and Instagram in March, citing Meta as an “extremist organization”. “With next week’s results we expect Meta to continue its run of challenging quarters,” he said.",News/Technology,Meta investors brace for a difficult quarter after stocks nosedive,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/23/meta-earnings-report-preview-facebook
4/24/2022,"The contrast was startling. In New York, António Guterres, the UN secretary general, launched a belated, desperately needed initiative to halt the war in Ukraine. “At this time of great peril and consequence, he [Guterres] would like to discuss urgent steps to bring about peace,” his spokesman said. The UN chief, he revealed, was proposing immediate, in-person talks with Vladimir Putin in Moscow and Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv. At roughly the same time as this hopeful development unfolded, the UK’s Boris Johnson, riding a “Partygate” getaway plane to India, was colourfully rubbishing peace efforts. Putin, he claimed, was an untrustworthy reptile. “I really don’t see how the Ukrainians can easily sit down and come to some kind of accommodation. How can you negotiate with a crocodile when it’s got your leg in its jaws?” Johnson asked. This gaping disconnect is doubly disturbing. It suggests lack of coordination between the UN chief and a permanent member of the UN security council on how best to proceed. It also highlights a wider problem: diverging, sometimes opposing, occasionally self-serving, approaches to the crisis by western leaders who have hitherto trumpeted their unity of purpose. The outrage in western countries sparked by Putin’s 24 February invasion is starting to fade. Likewise the burst of optimism that followed Ukraine’s success in repelling the Russian advance around Kyiv. Now, as Moscow begins a huge, slow-motion offensive in the east, concern grows that this conflict has no end-point and that the enormous economic and human damage that results may be permanent – and global. Johnson, typically, is not looking much beyond the present moment. The UK and Nato, he said, would just “keep going with the strategy” of imposing sanctions on Russia and supplying weapons to Kyiv. Johnson supports a free, independent Ukraine but, like other alliance leaders, appears to lack a thought-through, long-term plan to achieve it. What if Ukrainian forces start losing? What if the country is partitioned, or nears collapse? The price of failure – the true cost of a Putin victory – could be staggering. It is potentially unsupportable for fractious western democracies and poorer countries alike, beset by simultaneous post-pandemic security, energy, food, inflation and climate crises. Yet out of myopic self-interest over issues such as Russian oil and gas imports, and from fear of wider escalation, western leaders duck the tough choices that could ensure Ukraine’s survival and help mitigate such ills. The past week furnished a grim glimpse of the future that awaits if Putin is able to continue to wage war with impunity, commit more heinous crimes, threaten nuclear and chemical blackmail and trash the UN charter. Drastically downgrading its growth forecasts due to the conflict, the International Monetary Fund predicted global economic fragmentation, rising debt and social unrest. David Malpass, head of the World Bank, said a “human catastrophe” loomed as an unprecedented, estimated 37% rise in food prices, caused by war-related disruption to supplies, pushed millions into poverty, increased malnutrition, and reduced funding for education and healthcare for the least well-off. More than 5 million people have fled Ukraine in two months, and more will follow, exacerbating an international migration emergency that extends from Afghanistan to the Sahel. In drought-hit east Africa, the World Food Programme says 20 million people may face starvation this year. Putin’s war did not create the drought, but the UN warns it could hurt efforts to reduce global heating, thereby triggering further displacement and forced migration. The broader, negative political impact of the war, should it rage on indefinitely, is almost incalculable. The UN’s future as an authoritative global forum, lawmaker and peacekeeper is in jeopardy, as more than 200 former officials warned Guterres last week. At risk, too, is the credibility of the international court of justice, whose injunction to withdraw was scorned by Putin, and the entire system of war crimes prosecutions. In terms of democratic norms and human rights, the full or partial subjugation of Ukraine would spell disaster for the international rules-based order – and a triumph for autocrats everywhere. What message would it send, for example, to China over Taiwan, or indeed to Putin as he covets the vulnerable Baltic republics? Islamist terrorists who now furtively plot to exploit the west’s Ukraine distraction would relish such a victory for violence. Failure to stop the war, rescue Ukraine and punish Russia’s rogue regime to the fullest extent possible would come at an especially high price for Europe and the EU. In prospect is a second cold war with permanent Nato bases on Russia’s borders, massively increased defence spending, an accelerating nuclear arms race, unceasing cyber and information warfare, endemic energy shortages, rocketing living costs, and more French-style, Russian-backed rightwing populist extremism. In short, the dawn of a new age of instability. Why on earth would politicians such as America’s Joe Biden, Germany’s Olaf Scholz, and France’s Emmanuel Macron tolerate so fraught and dangerous a future when, by taking a more robust stand now, they might prevent much of it from materialising? By supposedly avoiding risks today, they ensure a much riskier tomorrow. Sending weapons and best wishes is not enough. Conferring last week, western leaders debated providing security guarantees for Ukraine after the war. All well and good. But this war is happening now. Who will guarantee Ukraine’s survival in the possibly decisive next few weeks? Who, if push comes to shove, will move beyond training missions and provide direct, in-country military support? Let’s get real. For all its heroism and sacrifice, Ukraine may lose this fight. Dreadful though it sounds, Putin could win. If the west so abandons its principles and values to let that happen, the long-term price, for everyone, will be a whole new world of pain.",News/World news,"If we abandon Ukraine, respect for international law could collapse | Simon Tisdall",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/24/the-awful-truth-is-dawning-putin-may-win-in-ukraine-the-result-would-be-catastrophe
4/24/2022,"The great abuses of power by Richard Nixon’s administration which are remembered collectively as Watergate had one tremendous benefit: they inspired a raft of legislation which significantly strengthened American democracy. This new book from the Brookings Institution, subtitled How to Restore Ethics, The Rule of Law and Democracy, recalls those far-away days of a functioning legislative process. The response to Watergate gave us real limits on individual contributions to candidates and political action committees (Federal Election Campaign Act); a truly independent Office of Special Counsel (Ethics in Government Act); inspector generals in every major agency (Inspector General Act); a vastly more effective freedom of information process; and a Sunshine Law which enshrined the novel notion that the government should be “the servant of the people” and “fully accountable to them”. Since then, a steadily more conservative supreme court has eviscerated all the most important campaign finance reforms, most disastrously in 2010 with Citizens United, and in 2013 destroyed the most effective parts of the Voting Rights Act. Congress let the special counsel law lapse, partly because of how Ken Starr abused it when he investigated Bill Clinton. The unraveling of Watergate reforms was one of many factors that set the stage for the most corrupt US government of modern times, that of Donald Trump. Even someone as inured as I am to Trump’s crimes can still be astonished when all the known abuses are catalogued in one volume. What the authors of this book identify as “The Seven Deadly Sins of Trumpery” include “Disdain for Ethics, Assault on the rule of law, Incessant lying and disinformation, Shamelessness” and, of course, “Pursuit of personal and political interest”. The book identifies Trump’s original sin as his refusal to put his businesses in a blind trust, which led to no less than 3,400 conflicts of interest. It didn’t help that the federal conflict of interests statute specifically exempts the president. Under the first president of modern times with no interest in “the legitimacy” or “the appearance of legitimacy of the presidency”, this left practically nothing off limits. The emoluments clause of the constitution forbids every government official accepting “any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State” but lacks any enforcement mechanism. So a shameless president could be paid off through his hotels by everyone from the Philippines to Kuwait while the Bank of China paid one Trump company an estimated $5.4m. (As a fig leaf, Trump gave the treasury $448,000 from profits made from foreign governments during two years of his presidency, but without any accounting.) Trump even got the federal government to pay him directly, by charging the secret service $32,400 for guest rooms for a visit to Mar-a-Lago plus $17,000 a month for a cottage at his New Jersey golf club. The US Office of Special Counsel catalogued dozens of violations of the Hatch Act, which prohibits political activity by federal officials. Miscreants included Peter Navarro, Dan Scavino, Nikki Haley and most persistently Kellyanne Conway. The OSC referred its findings to Trump, who of course did nothing. Conway was gleeful. “Let me know when the jail sentence starts,” she said. There was also the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, addressing the Republican convention from a bluff overlooking Jerusalem during a mission to Israel. In a different category of corruption were the $43,000 soundproof phone booth the EPA administrator Scott Pruitt installed and the $1m the health secretary Tom Price spent on luxury travel. Those two actually resigned. The book is mostly focused on the four-year Trump crimewave. But it is bipartisan enough to spread the blame to Democrats for creating a climate in which no crime seemed too big to go un-prosecuted. Barack Obama’s strict ethics rules enforced by executive orders produced a nearly scandal-free administration. But Claire O Finkelstein and Richard W Painter argue that there was one scandal that established a terrible precedent: the decision not to prosecute anyone at the CIA for illegal torture carried out under George W Bush. This “failure of accountability” was “profoundly corrosive. The decision to ‘look forward, not back’ on torture … damaged the country’s ability to hold government officials to the constraints of the law”. However, the authors are probably a little too optimistic when they argue that a more vigorous stance might have made the Trump administration more eager to prosecute its own law breakers. The authors point out there are two things in the federal government which are even worse than the wholesale violation of ethical codes within the executive branch: the almost total absence of ethical codes within the congressional and judicial branches. The ethics manual for the House says it is “fundamental that a member … may not use his or her official position for personal gain”. But that is “virtually meaningless” became members can take actions on “industries in which they hold company stock”. The Senate exempts itself from ethical concerns with two brilliant words: no member can promote a piece of legislation whose “principal purpose” is “to further only his pecuniary interest”. So as long as legislation also has other purposes, personal profit is no impediment to passage. The authors argue that since the crimes of Watergate pale in comparison to the corruption of Trump, this should be the greatest opportunity for profound reform since the 1970s. But of course there is no chance of any such reform getting through this Congress, because Republicans have no interest in making government honest. Nothing tells us more about the collapse of our democracy than the primary concern of the House and Senate minority leaders, Kevin McCarthy and Mitch McConnell. Their only goal is to avoid any action that would offend the perpetrator or instigator of all these crimes. Instead of forcing him to resign the way Nixon did, these quivering men still pretend Donald Trump is the only man qualified to lead them.

But it is no longer truly theirs, nor is it the party of Churchill, Macmillan, Heath or even of Margaret Thatcher. It is the Johnson party, which in less than three years under his leadership has moved from the centre right to the extreme right with its policies on immigration, policing and rights to free expression, its cruelty to the poor and its disdain for the law and parliament. Every Tory MP is already complicit in this transformation and no voter should mistake it for the Conservative party of the past.John HambleySnape, Suffolk I agree entirely with Simon Tisdall’s article “Nato should talk less and do more, or Ukraine will be torn apart, bit by bit” (World). Does anyone think Nato would not intervene if Russia invaded Sweden or Finland? Of course they would; those countries would not be left to fight on their own, it’s just inconceivable. Yet Ukraine, it seems, must just get on with it. Is Ukraine not European enough, is it too far east? Is it still seen as part of the Soviet Union instead of Europe “proper”? As pointed out in your article, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Slovakia, Czechia and Poland have shown more support, yet it seems their views aren’t considered important enough. Perhaps they also are thought of as ex-Soviet and not yet western enough to be truly influential. Nato is like an exclusive gentleman’s club.

The report makes clear that seeking a reduction in the caesarean rate at all costs is misguided and dangerous. The reason midwives seek to promote physiological birth is because we are trained professionals who understand the evidence base to support better outcomes and witness the results of over-intervention – increased morbidity, increased mortality and traumatised parents. The report shows where this intention has gone tragically astray and we must learn lessons.

It was not a direct print, rather, the two ingredients of iron gall ink, tannic acid and iron sulfate, were separately applied to the cloth and to the body and pressed together. The resulting print matches the Shroud of Turin in that it appears, after exposure to air and humidity, in shades of sepia. Like the shroud, it is a negative, with the protruding parts of the subject’s body revealed as dark against light.Gary VikanBaltimore, Maryland Your article mischaracterises the material donated to the Tate by Barry Joule and the events that have taken place since (“Francis Bacon bequest will be sent to France in snub to Tate gallery”, News).

4/24/2022,"Elon Musk has now put together a $46.5bn financing package to buy Twitter – two thirds of it from his own assets, and a third from bank loans secured against Twitter’s assets. It’s the biggest acquisition financing ever put forward for one person. Twitter’s founder and top managers don’t want Musk to take over the company. They offered him a seat on the board but he didn’t want it because he’d have to be responsible to all other shareholders. Now they’re adopting a “poison pill” to stop him. But Musk plans to buy shares directly with a tender offer that shareholders can’t refuse. After all, it’s a free market. Musk says no one should object to what he wants to do with Twitter because he’s a “free speech absolutist,” and who can be against free speech? Besides, he and his apologists say, if consumers don’t like what he does with Twitter they can go elsewhere. Freedom to choose. Free market? Free speech? Free choice? When billionaires like Musk justify their motives by using “freedom,” beware. What they actually seek is freedom from accountability. They want to use their vast fortunes to do whatever they please – unconstrained by laws or regulations, shareholders, or even consumers. The “free market” increasingly reflects the demands of big money. Unfriendly takeovers, such as Musk is mounting at Twitter, weren’t part of the “free market” until the late 1970s and early 1980s. Before then, laws and regulations constrained them. Then came corporate raiders like Carl Icahn and Michael Milken. Their MO was to find corporations whose assets were worth more than their stock value, borrow against them, acquire enough shares to force them to cut costs (such as laying off workers, abandoning their communities, busting unions, and taking on crushing debt), and cash in. But the raiders’ antics often imposed huge social costs. They pushed America from stakeholder capitalism (where workers and communities had a say in what corporations did) to shareholder capitalism (where the sole corporate goal is to maximize shareholder value). Inequality skyrocketed, insecurity soared, vast swaths of America were abandoned, and millions of good jobs vanished. The raiders altered the “free market” to allow them to do this. That’s what the super-rich do. There’s no “free market” in nature. The “free market” depends on laws and rules. If you have enough money, you can buy changes in those laws and rules that make you even more money. (You can also get the government to subsidize you – Musk has received a reported $4.9bn so far.) “Free speech” is another freedom that turns on wealth. As a practical matter, your ability to be heard turns on the size of the megaphone you can buy. If you’re extremely rich you can purchase the Washington Post or own Fox News. If you’re the wealthiest person in the world you can buy one of the biggest megaphones in the world called Twitter – and then decide who can use it, what its algorithms are going to be, and how it either invites or filters out big lies. Musk said last week that he doesn’t care about the economics of the deal and is pursuing it because it is “extremely important to the future of civilization.” Fine, but who anointed Musk to decide the future of civilization? Which brings us to free choice. If consumers don’t like what Musk does with Twitter, they cannot simply switch to another Twitter-like platform. There aren’t any. The largest social media platforms have grown gigantic because anyone who wants to participate in them and influence debate has to join them. After they reach a certain size, they’re the only megaphone in town. Where else would consumers go to post short messages that can reach tens of millions of people other than Twitter? With social media, the ordinary rules of competition don’t apply. Once a platform is dominant it becomes even more dominant. As Donald Trump discovered with his “Truth Social” fiasco, upstarts don’t stand much chance. Musk’s real goal has nothing to do with the freedom of others. His goal is his own unconstrained freedom – the freedom to wield enormous power without having to be accountable to laws and regulations, to shareholders, or to market competition – which is why he’s dead set on owning Twitter. Unlike his ambitions to upend transportation and interstellar flight, this one is dangerous. It might well upend democracy.

4/24/2022,"Boris Johnson is facing another damaging parliamentary defeat on Monday over controversial plans that would give ministers new powers to determine the remit of the independent watchdog that oversees UK elections. A cross-party group of peers is this weekend rallying behind an amendment to the elections bill that would strike out key clauses which, they believe, would seriously undermine the Electoral Commission’s independence and open the way for political interference in the conduct of elections. The increasingly bitter row is threatening to further tarnish the government’s reputation over constitutional issues, following the unlawful prorogation of parliament in 2019, the Owen Paterson lobbying controversy last year and the ongoing “Partygate” scandal. The main actors behind the Lords plan to neuter the bill and protect the commission’s independence are the crossbench peer Lord Judge, a former lord chief justice for England and Wales, the ex-Tory cabinet minister Lord Young of Cookham, the Lib Dem peer Lord Wallace of Saltaire and former Labour home secretary Lord Blunkett. Blunkett told the Observer on Friday that the vote was a key moment in the defence of democracy against ministerial attempts to undermine it. “A free and fair election is the touchstone of any functioning democracy, which is why we [Labour] introduced the Electoral Commission despite having a large majority and the political ability to give Labour an advantage in future elections,” he said. “Revoking that independence would set a dangerous precedent for current and future elections, and would give an unacceptable signal to the rest of the world.” Pressure on ministers over the bill has been mounting for months, with the Lords having already defeated the government over plans to introduce compulsory photo ID for voters. The government insists the ID plan would reduce electoral fraud, while opponents say the problem is minimal and that such a draconian move would discourage many from voting. Peers – with backing from the internationalist, pro-democracy organisation Best for Britain – have also forced ministers to remove clauses that would have allowed the government of the day to ban certain types of campaigners from participating in election campaigns. If the government is also defeated on Monday over the Electoral Commission’s independence, ministers will have to decide whether to try to reinsert the plan (along with that for photo ID) when the bill returns to the Commons ahead of the Queen’s Speech on 10 May. In a highly unusual move in February, the commission wrote a public letter to Michael Gove, the cabinet minister with overall responsibility for elections, saying its provisions were “inconsistent with the role that an independent electoral commission plays in a healthy democracy”. It added: “This independence is fundamental to maintaining confidence and legitimacy in our electoral system.” William Wragg, the Conservative chair ofthe Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee, also wrote recently to Gove about the bill, saying that allowing ministers to shape the remit of the independent elections watchdog would constitute “an unacceptable risk to the functioning of our democracy”. This weekend, a broad coalition of organisations has put further pressure on Gove over the photo ID issue. The group, which includes the Electoral Reform Society, Fair Vote UK, Hope not Hate and Liberty, say in a letter to Kemi Badenoch, a minister in Gove’s department, that the plans risk seeing millions of people turned away from polling booths. “We believe no voter should be prevented or deterred from casting their vote,” they say. “Making this change will help ensure that the over two million voters estimated to be without photographic ID do not face being turned away at the ballot box. “In particular, it will at least partially address our evidence-based concerns that mandatory photo voter ID will discriminate against young people, older people and people with disabilities (who are less likely to hold such forms of identification).” They are also calling for ministers to accept a Lords amendment that would allow various forms of ID, such as debit cards, to be acceptable proof identity. They also call for the Electoral Commission to remain independent: “A truly independent elections watchdog is important for giving voters confidence that our elections are free and fair. It is vital for our democracy that everyone who is entitled to vote can vote.” The Electoral Commission has been criticised by pro-Brexit Tories for overreaching itself, particularly with its investigations into central figures in the Vote Leave campaign after the 2016 Brexit referendum. Gove is known to have been one of those keen to rein it in. The Cabinet Office has consistently maintained maintains that the bill is a “necessary and a proportionate approach to reforming the Electoral Commission while respecting its independence”. An Opinium poll on behalf of Best for Britain today shows that 70% of people believe the Electoral Commission should remain fully independent of the government, including 79% of Conservative voters. Naomi Smith, CEO of Best for Britain, said: “This authoritarian bill is an obvious attempt to silence critics and cripple opposition, and represents a premeditated plan to rig future elections in favour of those in government.”",News/Politics,Lords rally to protect independence of UK’s Electoral Commission,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/24/lords-rally-to-protect-independence-of-uks-electoral-commission
4/24/2022,"Château Monconseil Gazin, Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux, France 2019 (£9.95, thewinesociety.com) Over the next month, the wine world will be drawn, as it is every year around this time, to en primeur season in Bordeaux, where producers in what is still the world’s most prestigious wine region are showing off barrel samples of the still-maturing young wines of their most recent vintage. After a run of three excellent vintages, 2021 was a bit of a trial for Bordeaux’s châteaux: late frost, heavy spring rain, and mildew, plus the logistical complications of working in a pandemic, combined to make this one of the most challenging growing seasons in recent Bordeaux history, greatly reducing the crop. Whether the quality will compensate for the lack of quantity, as the local wine association, the CIVB, would like us to think, we’ll have to wait and see. For now, I’d be happy to enjoy the fruits of the great 2019 vintage, in the shape of classic, excellent value young cassis-scented claret from Château Monconseil Gazin. Domaine de Valmengaux, “En Jarre”, Bordeaux, France 2018 (£24.95, bbr.com) The annual circus that surrounds first the en primeur tastings and then the announcement of the opening prices by each château, can present a rather distorted picture of Bordeaux’s wine scene. Only a few dozen châteaux can command the really big bucks (up to several thousands of pounds per case). For the rest of the region’s more than 6,000 growers, 300 négociants (producers that bottle wine sourced from across the region) and 33 co-operatives, reality is more gritty than glitzy. The Bordeaux profonde is also rather less uptight and conservative than the haute-bourgeois stereotype would allow. True, the region had for a while lacked some of the adventurous small-producer energy found in other parts of France. But outside the mainstream there is plenty of experimentation going on. Organic producer Domaine de Valmengaux, a new producer formed by a group of 50 friends, for example, uses clay amphora rather than the usual oak barrels for its wonderfully pure, deeply succulent red. Blanc Sec de Suduiraut, Bordeaux, France 2020 (from £15.88, laywheeler.com; cambridgewine.com) Other exciting producers that have brought something of the counter-cultural energy found in the Loire, the Rhône or the Languedoc to the Gironde estuary include jazz singer Thierry Valette, whose biodynamically grown Puy Arnaud wines include the wonderfully perfumed fresh currants and leafiness of Les Acacias Cabernet Franc 2017 (£29.99, northandsouthwines.co.uk); and Domaine de Galouchey, another organic estate, planted in the early 2000s in the unfashionable Entre-Deux-Mers subregion, with a real back-to-the-land, natural-leaning style, as found in the vibrant, expressive (and evocatively named) Vin de Jardin 2018 (£33, shrinetothevine.co.uk). It’s also worth remembering that Bordeaux has more to offer than red. Its white wines, both dry and sweet, have their own distinctive allure, as exemplified by two from the great Sauternes estate Château Suduiraut: the scintillating grapefruit tang and glow and herby lift of the Blanc Sec dry, and the honeyed, crystallized, gorgeousness of the sweet 2013 vintage Sauternes it made for Waitrose’s No 1 series (£16.99, 37.5cl).
