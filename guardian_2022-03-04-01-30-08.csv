3/4/2022,"In an unprecedented display of cosmic littering, a wayward rocket body will crash into the far side of the moon on Friday marking the first time that a piece of space junk has accidentally struck the lunar surface. The spent rocket booster, believed to be part of the Chinese Chang’e 5-T1 mission which swung around the moon in 2014, is predicted to slam into the Hertzsprung crater at 12.25pm GMT, though the precise time and location are unclear. Travelling at more than 5,500mph (2.5km per second), the tumbling 4 tonne rocket body will plough into the surface at a shallow angle, scattering debris and tearing a crater of its own that is expected to reach 20 metres to 30 metres across (65ft to 100ft). Dr Vishnu Reddy, an associate professor at the University of Arizona whose team helped to identify the object, said it highlights how space junk now extends beyond Earth, where the US already tracks more than 27,000 pieces of orbital debris. “Things have hit the moon in the past, but those were primarily deliberate impacts, or we tried to land and crashed on the surface,” Reddy said. “This is an impact of a rocket body that is unintentional.” Astronomers will not get to observe the impact directly, but scientists hope that images of the crash site can be taken soon after by Nasa’s lunar reconnaissance orbiter or India’s Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft, both of which are circling the moon. China’s Chang’e 4 lander, which landed on the far side of the moon in 2019, is too far away to witness the spectacle. A natural battering from meteorites has left the moon pocked with half a billion craters the same size or larger than the one the booster will make. But the lunar surface also bears the scars of rocket stages that were crashed intentionally, and moon missions that bit the dust rather than settled on it. During the Apollo era, huge Saturn V rocket bodies were steered into the surface so that instruments placed on the surface could monitor the resulting shock waves for analysis of the moon’s interior. Junk left behind by the US astronauts has since been joined by more curious material. In 1999, a private lunar mission sent the ashes of the astrogeologist Eugene Shoemaker into a “crater of eternal darkness” near the moon’s south pole. Three years ago, the Israeli Beresheet probe crashed on the surface scattering thousands of tiny tardigrades. Despite hopes for their survival, many scientists suspect they were turned to mush. Reddy’s group has catalogued nearly 200 objects drifting about in “cislunar space” between the Earth and the moon. The booster was originally thought to be part of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that launched in 2015, but Reddy and his students reported that its optical spectra – the wavelengths of light it reflects – more closely matched that of the Chinese Long March 3C rocket which launched the Chang’e 5-T1 mission a year earlier. The unintended impact on the moon should focus attention on the growing issue of space debris, Reddy believes. “People realise that it’s really bad in Earth orbit, but now we are slowly putting debris into cislunar space,” he said. “We’ve screwed up around the Earth already, let’s not do that around the moon.” There is more at stake than cosmic littering, though. According to Reddy, there are national security implications given how hard it is to spot and track objects so far from Earth. “What can our adversaries put into cislunar space that we are not aware of?” he said. “You can track something 4in across in Earth orbit, but tracking something that small in cislunar space? Forget it.” Chris Newman, professor of space law and policy at Northumbria University, called the impending impact a “warning flag” given plans to return humans to the moon. “It’s clear that as we start putting people on the moon more permanently this is something we’re going to have to think about,” he said. David Rothery, professor of planetary geosciences at the Open University, said anyone worried about the rocket body striking the moon should be more concerned about biological contamination, though even this is a tiny risk, he stressed. “Probably very few microbes that it accidentally carried with it have survived, or will survive the impact,” he said. “One more crater on the moon is nothing to get upset about.”",News/Science,Space junk about to crash into far side of moon ,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/03/space-junk-about-to-crash-into-far-side-of-moon
3/4/2022,"Of all the TikTok trends to break this year, perhaps one of the least likely is the sight of users around the world singing in Nigerian pidgin English and Yoruba as they dance to the two biggest west African hits of the moment. One is a slowed-down version of the languid love song Love Nwantiti (Ah Ah Ah) by the Nigerian singer CKay; the other is the party-ready Peru by fellow Nigerian Fireboy DML, which reached No 2 on the UK singles chart earlier this year thanks to a remix featuring Ed Sheeran. Internationally, west African music is having a moment. If you ask Nigerian afro-rave artist Rema, that’s no surprise at all. “I knew I was going to break, I knew I was going to be global. The only thing I didn’t know was the timing,” he says. The jumpy, jovial Dumebi, from Rema’s self-titled debut EP, blew up in 2019 and has been streamed more than 56m times on Spotify. “This phase of Afrobeats is really having that global stance,” he says. “Every generation has added to the buildup. At this stage, the main motive is to globalise the sound and make every continent rock with it.” That motive is reaping rewards. Last July, Wizkid’s Essence made history as the first Nigerian song to chart on the US Billboard 100, bolstered by a remix featuring Justin Bieber. It was the year’s most Shazamed song in the US (having heard the track out and about, listeners used the music-identifying app to discover what it was), and reached No 16 in the UK. Love Nwantiti hit No 3 on the UK singles chart and major acts such as Wizkid and Davido are selling out massive venues such as London’s O2 Arena. Madonna, ever keen to stay close to the centre of pop culture, released a Fireboy DML remix of her 1998 single Frozen this week. Davido, who is playingthe O2 this Saturday, says the audience makeup of his UK shows has reflected the rising popularity of his sound. “Now Afrobeats has a bigger audience, we tend to see a different demographic,” he says. “When I started doing shows in the UK it was predominately Africans, then, as Afrobeats got bigger, we started getting mixed crowds.” For a long time, African artists with a lucrative global listenership were generally in the “world music” category – think Baaba Maal, Salif Keita and Rokia Traoré, the type of artist who might appear on Jools Holland. The new generation, however, are aimed squarely at young pop fans. Sipho Dlamini is CEO of Universal Music’s South Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa division. His appointment reflected the major label’s expansion into the African market, though he notes that the rise of Afrobeats has been a long time coming. “For people that haven’t been paying attention or caught Afrobeats in the last 12 months, they’ll think it just happened,” he says. “But it has been a long journey to get [the genre] to where it is. It’s become a movement, it’s no longer about genre.” Christian Adofo, author of A Quick Ting on Afrobeats, the first book about the genre, argues that these developments relate to other sociocultural changes among the diaspora. He traces it to the annual homecoming events in December in Ghana and Nigeria – where diasporans return to the continent for musical and social events, and to visit loved ones. “The cultural programming, featuring a mix of artists from west Africa and the wider African diaspora, pulls a cosmopolitan range of creatives together,” he says. “They’re networking and bringing their professional expertise to push the subculture around the sound holistically.” These collaborations and cross-pollinations in turn feed into heavily globalised social media platforms such as TikTok, where musical success relies on catchiness rather than cultural familiarity – hence the languid Love Nwantiti finding popularity on the platform, albeit more than a year after its release. Amaarae found global success with her single Sad Girlz Luv Money, which featured fellow Ghanaian musician Moliy and the US singer Kali Uchis. She credits social media and streaming as a vital tool in breaking internationally. “With Apple Music, Spotify and TikTok, the world is a global village now,” she says. “As long as you make music that everyone in the world can connect to, all of these different platforms facilitate discoverability.” Dlamini explains that leading west African artists – including Wizkid, Davido and singer-songwriters Tiwa Savage and Tekno – went all out in their aims to make themselves globally popular, in some cases “even before the labels got involved”. The Nigerian singer D’banj found success after signing to Kanye West’s GOOD Music label, an affiliation that probably helped his single Oliver Twist become the first UK Top 10 single by a Nigerian artist. “You had a number of artists that would go to the UK and US, and be there for six months to a year working on music,” Dlamini says. Laying these foundations has led to high-profile collaborations with the likes of Drake (who featured Wizkid on One Dance) and Beyoncé (whose Don’t Jealous Me featured Tekno, Lord Afrixana, Yemi Alade and Mr Eazi). But what’s at stake with these crossover attempts? Despite their impact, the success of songs such as Peru and Essence remains relatively rare – and both songs truly ignited internationally thanks to collaborations with massive UK and US artists. Can Afrobeats artists have hits without these high-profile collaborations, often with white artists? “That’s a tricky question,” says Amaarae, who acknowledges the role that Uchis, a Colombian-American act, played in boosting Sad Girlz Luv Money. “Once the music is palatable, it will reach audiences. Having a key figure who is white definitely does help break the ice in those markets. Once you overcome that, then it’s easier to get in touch with those markets on your own.” Davido agrees. “We’ve had records that haven’t needed any US or UK artists to succeed, but yes, it does give more exposure,” he says. “A Justin Bieber remix obviously would be bigger than a regular remix. Same thing goes for an Ed Sheeran remix.” But deciding which direction to take with a single is often a toss-up between nabbing lucrative domestic markets and giving the extra push abroad. “Back home the original records would be bigger,” he says. And these collaborations work both ways. It was Sheeran who asked Fireboy DML if he could feature on Peru, which was already massive online. He had even written his own unsolicited verse. Although it may appear as if artists from the global north hold all the power, even relatively new Afrobeats artists offer innovative sounds, a unique knack for marketing and incredibly large fanbases (Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa). In a world where streaming is king, this crossover benefits British and US acts too: on Friday, Justin Bieber releases a new collaboration with the Nigerian star Omah Lay, who has more than 550m global streams. Rema, Davido and Amaarae all hope their music will travel internationally, but they also say this isn’t at the forefront of their minds when creating songs. Rema is set to release his debut album this year and says he hasn’t deliberately changed his sound to appeal to global listeners. And, while the likes of Essence, Peru and Love Nwantiti are breaking records, Adofo weighs the success of west African pop differently. “A number of songs we may now consider Afrobeats classics had finishing schools in migrant communities across the diaspora: on the hi-fi system of a barbershop, or the dancefloor of a uni rave,” he says. “They are memories attached to a moment in time and reflect a new cultural pride in African identity. That can’t be measured in a quantitative sense.” Davido says west African artists don’t need to push too hard. “We have our own festivals, so I don’t feel like we need to overdo anything now,” he says. “We need to stick to the game and just embrace our culture, and that’s what we’ve been doing. Like you see every December, everybody rolls back to Africa to experience homecoming and to experience Africa. The cycle is going the other way: the world is now coming to Africa.”",Arts/Music,‘It’s become a movement’: Afrobeats’ steady path to world domination,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/03/its-become-a-movement-afrobeats-steady-path-to-world-domination
3/4/2022,"In the last year of the 19th century, when Henrik Ibsen began a new play, his family – reports Michael Meyer’s biography – feared he would not finish it. Perhaps already weakened by the vascular illness that took hold soon after When We Dead Awaken’s completion, the writer was agitated, rushed. The play is Ibsen’s shortest and like Shakespeare’s The Tempest, to which it alludes, can be seen as an artist’s farewell. Norwegian sculptor Arnold Rubek returns, with his disappointed younger wife Maia, to a favoured resort hotel where they encounter Irene, model for the marble masterpiece that made Rubek rich and revered, and Ulfhejm, a primally direct bear-hunter, who might have wandered in from Peer Gynt. That echo is one of multiple textual self-references: Rubek’s sculpture is, like the manuscript in Hedda Gabler, a surrogate child. Elsewhere, a remembered child and a mysterious lady reference Little Eyolf and The Lady from the Sea. Combining subtitled Norwegian with some scenes in English (representing the distinct dialect of the bear-hunter, powerfully played by James Browne), Kjetel Bang-Hansen’s production for the Norwegian Ibsen Company, a glorious cultural exporter, plays on and around a Beckettian heap of debris designed by Mayou Trikerioti. This encourages the reading that the characters may be dead, revisiting people and scenes in a sort of Groundhog Night. Although Ibsen couldn’t have known that the 20th century would see him as the second greatest dramatist after Shakespeare, Rubek’s clear sense of his work having been wrong and wasted feels upsetting. The critic Edward Said, in his last book, On Late Style, used When We Dead Awaken to counter the common view that artists at the end achieve serene expertise and reconciliation: Ibsen, a great revolutionary of theatrical realism, seems determined in this play to explode theatrical convention again. Øystein Røger’s Rubek compellingly walks the tightrope between artistic arrogance and doubt, and captures the sculptor’s monkish wariness towards women, equally wary of Ragnhild Margrethe Gudbrandsen’s earthily dangerous Irene and Andrea Bræin Hovig’s floaty but knowing Maia. The older woman seems to represent art, the younger life, both abused and ruined by Rubek. The actors, delivering often heightened lines with an attractive naturalism, communicate the emotions so clearly that the subtitles often feel like mere underlining. At the Coronet theatre, London, until 2 April.",Arts/Stage,When We Dead Awaken review – Ibsen’s final play explores an artist’s farewell,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/03/when-we-dead-awaken-review-ibsen-coronet-theatre-london
3/4/2022,"Interpreters in the European parliament usually sound so monotonous and mechanical that even well-rested listeners have trouble staying awake. But when the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, addressed a parliamentary session via video link on Tuesday, something extraordinary happened: the person relaying his words into English was so moved that he audibly fought to hold back his tears. “We’re fighting … just for our land … and for our freedom,” he said, then sniffed, his voice almost breaking as Zelenskiy, wearing a khaki T-shirt in what looked like a bunker, declared: “Despite the fact … that all our cities of our country are now blocked … nobody is going to enter and intervene with the freedom and our country.” This is just one example among many, of how Vladimir Putin’s brutal war on Ukraine is shaking Europeans to the core. Having long believed that war was impossible on the continent, they are shocked – and embarrassed – that Ukrainians must not only defend their country against Russian aggression, but must also defend democracy, freedom and the right of sovereign states to determine their destiny – the very principles that underpin the European Union. This war reinforces, with a jolt, the very raison d’etre of the EU as a peace project. After 24 February, no one will again be able to say that the EU’s founding credo, “Never again”, is outdated, and that the EU needs a new narrative to help younger generations – who have no memory of war – relate to European integration. This is why the 27 member states, notoriously divided and slow when it comes to decision-making in Brussels, are showing such remarkable resolve today – especially over foreign policy and defence, which they traditionally prefer to keep national. In the past week, they have cut off Russian banks from the Swift payment system, financed the procurement of weapons to send to Ukraine (ironically from a fund called the European Peace Facility), blocked the Russian propaganda channels RT and Sputnik, and closed European skies for aircraft to and from Russia. Parliament even applauded the idea of Ukrainian membership of the EU, although most member states remain sceptical, because this process takes years. Fuelled by emotion, the European train is rolling so fast that some are cautioning restraint in the face of Putin’s threat of nuclear escalation – emphasising that the US and European countries will not directly fight in Ukraine. Yet the need for a strong territorial defence now tops the agenda – not just in Germany, which just doubled its defence budget for 2022, but even in militarily neutral Finland and Sweden, which are sending weapons to Ukraine. Neither of these Nordic EU members is in Nato, although both are closely collaborating with it. Public support for Nato membership is markedly growing. In Austria, where anti-Americanism is rife, similar discussions are taking place. A former ambassador to Moscow told public radio that Austrians are suddenly discovering that “Nato is our security”, adding, Das sind neue Zeiten (“This is a new era”). Putin’s war is now dominating EU debates on a range of other policies. After 15 years of talking, Brussels suddenly agreed to connect Ukraine and Moldova (feared to be next on Putin’s hitlist) to the European electricity grid. EU agriculture ministers have discussed extra supplies of wheat, food and fertiliser to countries that depend on shipments from Ukraine. Even eurozone monetary policies will change. No country will be punished for budget deficits and, with the increasing weaponisation of the world’s reserve currencies, eurozone membership will become more than a form of protection against exchange rate upheavals or a way to foster intra-EU trade – it will be a geopolitical insurance policy. Under these circumstances, Dutch-German resistance to common borrowing (Eurobonds) could melt away. Poland and Hungary, until now unwilling to welcome refugees, have suddenly opened border crossings to – admittedly –white, Christian ones. Polish workers in Belgium jump in their cars and drive east to help out as Ukrainians flee the fighting. A week of Russian bombardment has driven more than a million people from Ukraine into neighbouring countries of the EU. The UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR, expects another 4 to 5 million to come In 2015, the arrival of a million Syrian refugees led to political turmoil across Europe; now there is no panic at all. Rather, according to Hugo Brady of the International Centre for Migration Policy Development in Vienna: “Eastern European countries are having their Wir schaffen das moment”. The German-French writer and political scientist Alfred Grosser wrote in Wie anders sind die Deutschen (How Different Are the Germans?) that Joseph Stalin deserved the first Charlemagne prize for services to European integration, for without the shared, transatlantic fear of communist totalitarianism, “there would never have been a [European] community”. Fear of Putin now has a similar function. It brings the US and Europe closer together, mutes internal discord in the EU for now, and makes clear that Nato is not, as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, once suggested, “brain-dead” but Europe’s ultimate guarantor of peace. Putin’s invasion “appears to be pushing the EU to centralise more rapidly than before in its history”, Kathleen McNamara and Daniel Kelemen, professors of Georgetown and Rutgers university respectively, argued in the Washington Post this week. For the moment, this is very much the dynamic. Undoubtedly, divisions between EU member states will reappear soon. They always do. And, as always, the EU will deal with them – this is why it was set up in the first place. But one thing is sure: because of Putin’s war, Europeans have discovered that “Never again” is here again.

3/4/2022,"Once the fall of Chelsea’s Roman empire was announced, Plain Old John Terry had to have his say. “The Best,” he roared on Social Media Disgrace Twitter, captioning a photo of him and the wannabe erstwhile Chelsea owner wrapped around the Premier League trophy. POJT was presumably referring to Roman but admittedly has previous in associating himself with others’ success. The wider Chelsea family is also reeling from the news that it’s actually all over. Probably. The end of the affair was announced just before the actual football team, requiring more than £150m worth of misfiring strikers, squeezed past Luton Town. “He has a genuine love for the game,” sniffed Tactics Tommy of Abramovich after the match, also admitting: “It’s very hard for me. It did not sink in yet.” So what next? “The sale of the club will not be fast-tracked but will follow due process,” roared Abramovich’s statement, dampening down any idea he might cut and run in the style of Frank Butcher after the latest blaze on Albert Square’s car lot. “I hope that I will be able to visit Stamford Bridge one last time to say goodbye to all of you in person,” he sobbed. Why might that due process be possible? Over to Big Website: “Boris Johnson is under growing pressure from the EU to go further and faster in imposing sanctions on Russian oligarchs over fears that assets are being swept out of the UK … A government official [said] it would take ‘weeks and months’ to enforce sanctions on the same level as the EU due to a lack of legal and investigative capacity.” Should Chelsea find a willing buyer then business may be able to carry on as usual, with Abramovich’s £1.5bn of loans waived and net proceeds of the sale to be used, opaquely, “for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine”. Blues fans can forevermore sing lustily of the man who paid for the realisation of their dreams but then had to make that unfortunate sharp exit. Elsewhere, Roman can be remembered as a pioneer of the fans-overlooking-bad-stuff phenomenon, just as long as there are gleaming baubles to gawp at come the season’s end. Doubles all round then, though another team in blue may not escape so lightly. Back to Big Website: “Alisher Usmanov, who has sponsorship links to [Frank Lampard’s] Everton, has had his assets frozen as part of sanctions imposed by the European Union.” Usmanov, remember, has a close business relationship with FLE owner Farhad Moshiri.

3/4/2022,"Vladimir Putin has told Emmanuel Macron that Kyiv’s “refusal to accept Russia’s conditions” means “the worst is still to come” in Ukraine, saying Moscow was aiming to take “full control” by diplomatic or military means, according to the Elysée. As the number of refugees fleeing the conflict passed a million and Russian forces, backed by heavy shelling, advanced on cities and key ports in the south and east, Russia’s president said in a 90-minute call to his French counterpart he was “prepared to go all the way”, the senior French official said. Putin – who initiated the call – repeated that Moscow’s objective was the “neutralisation, demilitarisation and de-nazification” of Ukraine, the official said, adding that Macron had responded that Putin was making a “major mistake” that would cost Russia dearly over the long term. “There was nothing in what President Putin said to reassure us,” the French official said. Macron had told the Russian president he was “lying to himself” and his country would end up “isolated, weakened and under sanctions for a very long time”. Ukrainian negotiators arrived by helicopter in Belarus for talks with Russia’s delegation on Thursday seeking an immediate ceasefire and humanitarian corridors to allow civilians to leave frontline areas, the Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak said. Kyiv has previously warned Russia’s demands were not realistic. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in a video that his country’s defensive lines were holding against the Russian invasion and praised the nation’s resistance in the face of relentless missile strikes. “We are a people who in a week have destroyed the enemy’s plans,” Zelenskiy said. “They will have no peace here.” Russian troops forced to visit supermarkets for food were not “warriors of a superpower, but confused children who have been used”, he said. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Moscow would not let Ukraine keep infrastructure that threatened Russia or tolerate what he said was a military threat from Ukraine, adding, without evidence, that Russia had information the US was worried about losing control over what he called chemical and biological laboratories in Ukraine, and accusing Nato of trying to maintain supremacy. Heavy overnight and early-morning shelling was again reported in Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, a city of 1.5 million people where emergency services said 34 civilians had been killed in the past 24 hours. A university and a hospital were hit, and TV footage showed a city-centre wasteland of ruined buildings and debris. Russian forces on Thursday occupied the regional administration building in Kherson, the regional governor, Hennadiy Lahuta, said, after the city’s mayor said Russian soldiers were in de facto control of the local council building. “I didn’t make any promises to them … I just asked them not to shoot people,” said Ihor Kolykhaiev. The capture of Kherson, strategically located at the mouth of the Dnipro River and with a population of nearly 250,000, would mark the first significant urban centre to fall since Moscow launched its invasion on 24 February. The city would maintain a strict 8pm to 6am curfew, restrict traffic to food and medicine deliveries, and require residents to obey commands and not to provoke the troops, he said. “The flag flying over us is Ukrainian,” he wrote. “And for it to stay that way, these demands must be observed.” With fighting continuing on multiple fronts across Ukraine, Mariupol, another large port city on the Azov Sea, was reportedly encircled and without light, water or heat. The city council said the shelling had been relentless and Russian troops were creating a “humanitarian catastrophe” by trying to prevent civilians leaving. “They are breaking food supplies, setting us up in a blockade,” the council said. “Deliberately, for seven days, they have been destroying critical life-support infrastructure. This is genocide of Ukrainian people.” Residents of Odesa on the Black Sea, Ukraine’s biggest port city and a vital link in Ukraine’s economy, were also preparing to defend it amid warnings of an imminent Russian seaborne landing. Airstrikes on the city have multiplied and a Russian naval convoy of at least eight ships was seen off the coast. Russia’s advance on the capital has made little progress, the UK’s defence ministry said. “The main body of the large Russian column advancing on Kyiv remains over 30km (19 miles) from the centre, having been delayed by staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion,” it said. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said the situation in the capital was “difficult but under control”, adding that there had been no casualties overnight and that explosions heard overnight were Ukrainian air defences striking down incoming Russian missiles. The UN human rights office has confirmed the deaths of 227 civilians and 525 injuries during the fighting, but said the actual toll would already be much higher. Ukraine has said at least 350 civilians have died and more than 2,000 have been injured. The UN refugee agency said the number of people fleeing the country had surpassed 1 million by early Thursday morning – about 2% of Ukraine’s population of 44 million – adding that “at this rate” the exodus could make the country the source of “the biggest refugee crisis this century”. The high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, appealed for the “guns to fall silent” so humanitarian aid could reach millions more still inside the country, and cautioned that the flood of people escaping the war was far from over and could eventually total 4 million. The Russian attack, condemned on Wednesday in an overwhelming vote at the UN general assembly, has led to a barrage of international sanctions that have plunged Russia’s economy into chaos and ever deepening isolation. The rouble again hit record lows on Thursday after the ratings agencies Fitch and Moody’s downgraded Russia’s sovereign debt to “junk” status, while an estimated 80% of Russian banks’ assets – and half its central bank’s reserves – had been immobilised. The EU was readying additional steps against Russia if the situation on the ground in Ukraine deteriorated, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said on Thursday, and was also preparing in case of Russian retaliation. French authorities on Thursday seized the Amore Vero, a superyacht owned by a company linked to Igor Sechin, chief executive of the Russian energy giant Rosneft, at La Ciotat, near Marseille, after reports that German authorities had seized the superyacht Dilbar belonging to the billionaire Alisher Usmanov on Wednesday. The international criminal court has opened an investigation into possible war crimes after an unprecedented number of countries backed the move. Karim Khan, the ICC’s chief prosecutor, said he would begin work “as rapidly as possible” to look for possible crimes against humanity or genocide committed in Ukraine.",News/World news,Ukraine war: Putin says ‘worst is to come’ as Kyiv rejects Russia conditions,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/ukraine-war-refugee-exodus-has-reached-a-million-says-un-as-russia-takes-over-kherson
3/4/2022,"A few years ago my son’s school organised a World Book Day in which pupils were asked to turn up in costume. Two kids turned up wearing full Viking outfits, complete with plastic axes and horned helmets. They looked brilliant. Only trouble was their parents had got the day wrong: they turned up in costume the day before the actual event, and as they had been dropped off by taxi, they had to spend the first part of the day in costume while their fellow pupils were in normal school uniform.Phil Jones, Surrey In March 2020, just before the UK went into lockdown, I was anxious about whether to send my son to nursery when he excitedly reminded me that it was World Book Day.

I was six feet tall, as I did my growing early, and the resultant photo haunts me to this day. Ten years later, giving a presentation at my former school about careers in publishing, I put the Cruella photo up on screen in the hope that it would endear me to the teenagers and possibly get a laugh. The picture was met with deathly silence so I rushed the rest of the presentation and fled.Natalie Stuart, London Two years ago, my daughter, then 14, put on social media that she was coming to school as the Very Hungry Caterpillar, with a request for people to spend the day approaching her with fruit.

3/4/2022,"Unless you happen to have a vested interest in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, it’s plain to see that the Oscars are trapped in a death spiral. Viewers are abandoning the ceremony in record numbers and, after last year’s debacle – a bizarre jokeless gushfest held in a train station – it’s hard to see how they will ever return. Fortunately, the Academy braintrust has schemed up two dramatic changes to this year’s ceremony that should help to bring things back into line. The first is that a bunch of awards won’t actually be televised live but edited into the broadcast, which will help to make the show’s runtime far less punishing. The second change, though, has already backfired. The biggest complaint about the Oscars has always been that it celebrates a narrow strata of middlebrow dramas that only exist to win Oscars, while anything too expensive or popular is bizarrely shunned. And so this year the Academy decided to address this by creating a new “fan favourite” category, where real people were asked to vote for the sort of films that real people enjoy. And they did this via a Twitter vote. You’re already way ahead of me here, aren’t you? Introducing #OscarsFanFavorite and #OscarsCheerMoment!How To Vote:• Tweet your favorite film of 2021 with #OscarsFanFavorite• Tweet the movie scene that made you cheer the loudest (ANY movie/year) with #OscarsCheerMoment• OR vote on https://t.co/dadD2i7Cy0 pic.twitter.com/HJclTiYGni That’s right. The Oscars chose to popularise their ceremony by handing the reins over to the social media platform that once voted to call a government polar research vessel Boaty McBoatface. As such, at least as things currently stand, the #OscarsFanFavorite hashtag has become a nightmarish mishmash of bad choices, joke entries and protest votes. I say this as an impartial observer, but it has the potential to be absolutely hilarious. In fairness, some of the films you expected to be included in #OscarsFanFavorite are present and correct. Spider-Man: No Way Home, the runaway sensation that single-handedly shocked the post-Covid box office back to life, is among the choices. As is The Suicide Squad, arguably the only other standout superhero movie of the last 12 months. The punctuation nightmare of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Tick, Tick… Boom! has also made the shortlist, presumably because it makes up roughly a third of all TikTok videos in circulation. Dune is there, too, as well as The Power of The Dog – a sign that the thinnest of slivers exists between popularity and critical acclaim. And then we get into the weirdness. Sing 2 is the only animated film to make the cut – in the year of Encanto and The Mitchells vs the Machines – but that can probably be forgiven due to the fact that Sing 2 is a non-stop start-to-finish blast. There is also Malignant, which is essentially the scientific opposite of Sing 2. Its inclusion here is probably down to the wild plotting decisions that occur in the latter half of the movie – no spoilers here – so perhaps it gained its place as revenge for the lack of awards won by its twisty cousins Fight Club and The Sixth Sense. Then there’s Army of the Dead. Now, Army of the Dead is not a particularly good film. It’s slapdash and forgettable, and wouldn’t normally feature on anyone’s best of list. But you know who directed Army of the Dead? That’s right, Zack Snyder. And you know who has an army of angry, revved-up keyboard warriors who still froth with anguish over the end results of Justice League? That’s right, Zack Snyder. The inclusion of Army of the Dead is a vote of a support, plain and simple. Zack Synder could have released a YouTube video of a kitten farting into a jar this year, and it would have still made the shortlist. The same goes for Minamata, a tiny film that has yet to make two million dollars. Again, Minamata is only on the list because it stars the newly “cancelled” actor Johnny Depp, a man who inspires a huge swell of support from a relatively small group of people online. A vanishingly small amount of people have actually seen Minimata, but nevertheless it exists here as a protest vote against cancellation, against Amber Heard, against the Fantastic Beasts franchise, against anyone that turned their back on Depp after a court labelled him a domestic abuser (which is to say everyone except the crew of Minimata and whoever made that perfume ad he’s in). Weirdest of all, though, is Cinderella. Honest to God one of the worst films ever made, you suspect that Cinderella only made the list because it stars Camila Cabello, and lots of people follow Camila Cabello on social media. That can be the only logical explanation. Cinderella cannot win this vote. It must not. For Cinderella to be considered in any way a success would tear a hole in the fabric of reality as we know it. We must stop this with all our power. Cinderella won’t win #OscarsFanFavorite, though. This is a popularity contest, and No Way Home is convincingly the most popular of the lot. Unless something terrible happens on the night, this is the way that things will go. But I hope the Academy has learned an important lesson here. As bad as your show might be, you must never ever hand the reins to the internet.",Arts/Film,#OscarsFanFavorite: how the Academy’s plea for popularity fell into chaos ,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/03/oscars-fan-favorite-academy-awards-hashtag
3/4/2022,"An American wakes up in a cozy hotel in Croatia, violently hungover and dazed from the night before. The room is strewn with clothes, the counter dotted with empty wine glasses. An unexpected blackout has rendered Beth’s (Leighton Meester) memory of the previous few hours into a few incoherent shards, ones she fears putting together. Relatable content for many women at some point in their lives, and thus a compelling starting point for The Weekend Away, a brisk and absorbing if increasingly thin thriller about a girls’ holiday weekend gone wrong. The Weekend Away, from the Strangerland director Kim Farrant, opens with a woman’s body floating in calm water, so you can assume Beth’s holiday in Croatia with best friend Kate (Christina Wolfe) will end in at least one casualty. The road to that point is initially sleek and promising, with a taut first third that quickly illustrates the women’s strained thirtysomething friendship and sets up a decently plausible mystery. Beth is a new mother barely out from the haze of sleepless nights and post-partum depression. Kate, blonde and beguiling, is a social butterfly reeling from a recent divorce that’s sent her into a black hole of hedonistic narcissism. After Beth admits over dinner that her marriage to Rob (Luke Norris) has cooled so much that they haven’t had sex in over a year, Kate drags her to a club, ignores her request for water, and finds two men to flirt with. The rest is a blacked-out blur, convincingly relayed in small flashbacks; Beth awakens from her bender to find Kate missing and delays her trip home to London to find her. The script from British-American writer Sarah Alderson, who also wrote the 2020 novel of the same name, proceeds apace from there with a steady five-minute rhythm of plot twists at first intriguing, then wearying, then either ludicrous or obvious. Beth enlists a friendly cab driver from the night out, Syrian refugee Zain (Ziad Bakri) to help follow leads that the dismissive police – charismatic Pavic (Amar Bukvic) and slightly more sympathetic female partner Kovač (Iva Mihalić) – don’t take seriously. At 90 minutes, The Weekend Away is not much longer than some streaming TV episodes, and accomplishes much more plot in its swift runtime. Beth summarily unravels a host of secrets behind her friendship with Kate, her marriage to Rob, and side characters such as creepy hotelier Sebastian (Adrian Pezdirc), though those secrets aren’t ultimately that surprising. More interesting is the film’s light jostling with some thornier, deeper topics: the inherent exploitation of tourism (Beth’s initial conversation with Zain, in which she tries to relate by speaking broken Arabic learned from her London job with a refugee organization), local annoyance with tourists’ recklessness, the struggle to keep up friendships as a new mother. But these intriguing moments are subsumed by the film’s relentless driving beat of plot twists, which ultimately demand that Beth distrust everyone, take increasingly desperate measures, and have a scenic chase through picturesque Split’s city center in the tourist uniform of cropped jeans and Keds. For many millennials, the kind looking to kick back on the couch for a night in without committing to three hours of Dune and keen to relate to the protagonist, the main draw of The Weekend Away will be its perennially underappreciated star Meester, who played beloved mean girl Blair Waldorf on the original Gossip Girl. Dressed understatedly with dry hair in a messy ponytail, Meester convincingly looks the part of a woman who has not taken a night to herself in a long while, and she delivers a solid performance. Her Beth – foggy and confused, learning to trust her own instincts as her assumptions crumble – grounds a thinly written character who could’ve been merely a plot device in a shallow story. The final twist is fairly obvious from halfway through the movie, but in Meester’s hands it still registers some emotional shock. That being said, in a time of too many bloated, meandering, dry TV episodes and films, I found The Weekend Away’s brevity and swift clip of twists refreshing. It’s a thriller by name but less edge-of-your-seat than lounging on the couch, absorbing beats of plot like the ocean tide. A little provocation with slight commitment – that’s not a bad night in by any means.

3/4/2022,"“Money in, money out,” is how Tobias Deml, creator of the new HBO documentary miniseries Gaming Wall Street, explains the common perception of the stock market while on Zoom with the Guardian. “It’s got to come from somewhere, right? But it’s all based on belief in the future. Money’s all belief. We believe in the government, borders, lots of things that aren’t materially real, but nonetheless exist in our shared imagination. The history of humanity is driven by these beliefs.” Stocks are fake, is what he’s saying, as in not real – “fairy dust”, to borrow a term from Matthew McConaughey’s coke-huffing trader in The Wolf of Wall Street, one of the many pop culture figures that zips by in the rapid-fire torrent of memes frenetically edited into Gaming Wall St. Shares of a company are an intangible concept that nonetheless have physical, real-world consequences in their regular minting of princes and paupers. This alchemy has long been the sole purview of high-finance types, professionals who’d have us believe that their business school educations and sophisticated Bloomberg Terminals make them masters of financial systems too hopelessly complex for us knuckle-draggers to comprehend. But in an era when a degree’s worth of knowledge sits waiting on the internet, it was only a matter of time until some normal folks realized that everyone’s making it up as they go. “Anyone who claims to know everything about how the market works is lying to you,” Deml says. The inevitable came to pass when Reddit users posting on the board r/wallstreetbets turned their plugged-in access and organization into power, an unprecedented episode on which Deml plants his focus. You may recall buzzing about GameStop last January, as the brick-and-mortar video game retailer’s lagging stock soared out of nowhere. Banded together for strength in numbers, the Redditors were pulling off a daring “short squeeze”, buying up shares of GME en masse to pump up the value before selling them back to big Wall Street firms who’d have to eat the difference. A high-risk, high-reward maneuver liable to fluctuate wildly over the course of a single day, it made millions for a select few and left many others in destitution. For better or worse, their stand blew up the toll booth barring ordinary folks from one of the fastest pathways to wealth. We are all day traders now. Deml grew up on the outside of high finance looking in. His father has been an ESG investor for more than 30 years, evaluating the “environmental, social and governance” factor of each stock to weigh conscience against profitability in his buying. “I’ve watched my father be so knowledgable about all this stuff, and I always felt kind of dumb,” he says. “I didn’t understand his job, and didn’t think I could teach myself, and didn’t even know what questions to ask him. So I remained kind of oblivious to this world for my whole life, until the pandemic hit and I had all this spare time. That’s when I found r/wallstreetbets. Things that seemed scary and complicated to comprehend weren’t just easier to get, but funny and crazy and wild. I finally saw what fascinated my dad in all this.” While finding his way around the no-fee investment app Robinhood, he became obsessed with big-fish frauds like Enron, and “how people deceive each other to make more money than they deserve to”. In the curious case of GameStop, he saw a David and Goliath narrative pitting a band of eccentric nerds against one-percenters perched comfortably in the highest halls of influence. His fascination wasn’t just in this unlikely uprising, however, but in its outrageous outcomes. Just as it seemed like the rabblerousers on r/wallstreetbets had the fatcats at Citadel Securities poised to take a big hit, Robinhood put the kibosh on the whole operation by halting all buying of GME and other so-called “meme stocks”. App users cried foul, and upon learning that Citadel happens to be a major shareholder in Robinhood, directed those complaints into a class-action lawsuit on charges of market manipulation. As Deml puts it, how any of this is allowed to happen represents “a tough question with a layered answer”. Much of the documentary is devoted to explaining the arcane physics of the market and unpacking its jargon, often through slick animated visual aids and voiceover from Kieran Culkin (practically in character as Succession’s smarmy Roman Roy). For three and a half months straight, six or seven days a week, Deml and his producer Tessa Byford spent 14 to 16 hours on the “brutal” post-production process required to render these lessons layperson-friendly without losing their nuance. “The big thing for me is that I didn’t want to dumb anything down,” Deml says. “There have been other documentaries about similar subjects before, where they’d equate short selling to borrowing a pen from somebody and then you have to give them their pen back, which don’t really teach you much of anything. Let’s stick with the real world, let’s stick with stocks, but use simple words. We had a dictionary to teach the audience, who we assume has a level of intelligence. The goal for me was to go from someone who has no knowledge of the stock market, and make them into someone who has knowledge that people working as brokers for decades still can’t see.” Down to some pretty granular specifics, we come to learn how moneyed giants can work an odious practice called “naked short-selling” to their advantage. It boils down to firms selling stocks that may or may not exist in order to magic the money insiders call “free cheddar” out of thin air. It’s a dirty trick that gives an unfair edge to those already holding most of the capital, a loophole that most amateur traders can’t wriggle through. “Naked short-selling has diminished over the years as laws have gotten stricter, but it’s still hard to track in the first place,” Deml says. “When you don’t know someone’s doing something, how are you going to punish them for it? If there’s anything to be learned from the GameStop affair, it’s that a leveling of the playing field is the only hope to start reshaping the landscape of America’s economy. The series begins as education and ends as activism, equipping the audience with knowhow and then urging the legislators to allow them an honest shot to use it. While Deml’s skeptical about whether the vampire squids of capitalism can ever be bested, he’s confident that the craftiness of smaller players on the margins will only continue growing. “One thing I learned making this is that in the world of finance, the word ‘crime’ is very rare,” Deml says. “Bernie Madoff, he committed an outright crime, but everyone else does ‘violations’. For a lot of the firms, it’s a balancing of legal risk versus monetary risk. I can make free money, but I might risk the regulator getting on my radar. You can kill that one mechanism – you make a perfect world where anyone caught naked short-selling goes to jail, and no one does it – but someone will find the next scheme. At the end of the documentary, we say that Wall Street has already come up with its next con. It’ll just keep on metastasizing.” Gaming Wall Street is now available on HBO Max with a UK date to be announced",Arts/Television & radio,‘Money’s all belief’: the docuseries unravelling the GameStop chaos,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/03/gaming-wall-street-hbo-series-gamestop
3/4/2022,"Smugglers have breached the Trump administration’s border wall along the US-Mexico frontier more than 3,000 times, government maintenance records obtained by the Washington Post reveal. Nearly 500 miles of barrier was constructed by the Trump administration beginning in 2019, mostly in rural New Mexico and Arizona. Former president Trump touted the “big, beautiful wall” as the “Rolls-Royce” of barriers, but smugglers have breached the wall at least 3,272 times, mostly with common power tools found at hardware stores. “No structure is impenetrable, so we will continue to work to focus resources on modern, effective border management measures to improve safety and security,” Luis Miranda, a spokesperson for Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) told the Post. He added that border security “requires a variety of resources and efforts, infrastructure, technology, and personnel”, much of which was not funded when Trump’s wall was constructed. Prior to its construction, former president Donald Trump promised Mexico would pay for construction of the border wall and that it would be “virtually impenetrable”. Ultimately, 458 miles of new border fencing was paid for by taxpayers at a cost of $11bn and there was evidence as early as 2019 that smugglers were sawing through the boundary with $100 power tools. Part of the border wall is constructed using posts cemented in concrete at the base which support a long lintel at the top. Smugglers are easily able to saw through the posts and swing them open, then continue using the same breach until the damage is detected by border patrol. Other sections have been damaged by monsoons. Smuggling organizations have sawn large enough holes to pass an SUV through. In one instance, an SUV loaded with 23 migrants passed through a section of border wall near San Diego and soon after collided with a semi-truck, killing 13 people. By 2021, the government had spent another $2.6m in taxpayer funds to repair the “wall”, and cited the lack of infrastructure infrastructure and personnel as an impediment to keeping it intact.",News/US news,"Trump’s border wall breached by smugglers over 3,000 times, records reveal",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/03/trump-border-wall-breached-smugglers
3/4/2022,"On 13 March, Wolfgang Rihm will celebrate his 70th birthday. For labels keen to mark the anniversary of one of Germany’s leading living composers, there’s no shortage of Rihm’s music still to be recorded, for though he is very well represented on disc, his output is so huge – more than 500 works at the last count – that the coverage is still by no means comprehensive. These performances, with Tamara Stefanovich, Christian Gerhaher, Tabea Zimmermann and Jörg Widmann as the outstanding soloists, come from Musica Viva, Munich’s annual new-music series, and bring together two of Rihm’s works from the beginning of the century with the Stabat Mater, for baritone and viola, of 2020. They also demonstrate vividly how protean Rihm’s music can be, and are a reminder of how, throughout his career, his music has always been in a dialogue with the past, and of how he has never been afraid to use whatever musical language seemed appropriate, whether that was neo-romanticism, post-Bergian expressionism or the most fractured pointillism. Both Sphäre nach Studie (Sphere after Study) for six instrumentalists of 2002 and Male über Male (Paint on Paint) for clarinet and ensemble of 2008 are based on earlier pieces, for piano and clarinet respectively, to which Rihm added further layers of instrumental commentary while leaving the original solo lines intact; they are both spare, intensely concentrated works, in which each pitch seems carefully rationed. By contrast the setting of the Stabat Mater hymn, with the viola line wreathed around the baritone’s declamatory phrases, feels almost medieval in its unadorned rawness; even now, it seems, Rihm can still spring a surprise. The second of BR Klassik’s Rihm releases this month is devoted to what is perhaps his best known ensemble work, Jagden und Formen. Like the disc above, it features members of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted this time by Franck Ollu. First performed in 1999, Jagden und Formen (Hunting and Forming) is a piece that Rihm revised three times, increasing its length each time. The BRSO plays what seems to be the definitive 2008 version, which lasts just over an hour. By comparison, Ensemble Modern’s fine recording of the 2002 score comes in at 10 minutes shorter. In either form, it’s one of Rihm’s greatest achievements, an unstoppable, ever-renewing stream of invention that seems to follow its own satisfying logic. It’s also phenomenally difficult to play, though you’d never guess it from the Munich performance.",Arts/Music,"Rihm: Sphäre nach Studie, Stabat Mater, etc review – a modern great, still springing surprises",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/03/rihm-sphare-nach-studie-stabat-mater-male-uber-male-review
