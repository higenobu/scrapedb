4/2/2022,"South Africa in 2010 were the only World Cup hosts to fail to make it through the group stage. Assessing the form of hosts, who have not had to play in qualifiers, is never easy but Qatar’s string of heavy defeats by Portugal, Ireland and Serbia last autumn, followed by a draw against Azerbaijan raises concerns. They did, though, win the Asian Cup under their Spanish coach, Félix Sánchez, in 2019. They will begin the tournament against Ecuador, who reached their fourth World Cup despite losing six of 18 qualifiers. The best side in the group are probably the Netherlands, after they were dragged from the roiling crisis of the past seven years by the reappointment of Louis van Gaal, who led them to third in Brazil in 2014. Aliou Cissé’s well-organised and physically imposing Senegal are the African champions despite at times struggling to score the goals their attacking talent suggests they might. Semi-finalists at the last World Cup, finalists at the Euros, can England go a step further and win a tournament for the first time since 1966? Certainly they should have the squad for it and in Gareth Southgate they have a clear-sighted, sober leader who has shown how supportive an environment can be created; the doubt is whether he is quick enough to react tactically when games begin to slip away from his side. The USA may be one of the less threatening of the second pot of seeds, but England have failed to beat them in two previous World Cup meetings. Iran add an element of political intrigue, and beat the USA in 1998. Their Croatian coach, Dragan Skocic, has made them solid rather than spectacular, 10 games in the third qualifying phase yielding only 15 goals for and four against. Scotland, Wales or Ukraine will make up the group after they conclude their delayed playoff. The days when Lionel Messi underperformed for his country while winning everything with his club are long gone. Since inspiring Argentina to the Copa América last year he has become a player far more effective at international level. Having ended Argentina’s 28-year trophy doubt, could he cap a magnificent career with a World Cup? Lionel Scaloni’s side might lack the star quality of some previous Argentina squads but they look much better balanced. Argentina will come up against a former manager in Gerardo Martino, whose experienced Mexico found qualification something of a slog with only two points taken from the four games against the USA and Canada. Poland’s playoff win over Sweden suggested they are rather more than just Robert Lewandowski plus 10 others. Saudi Arabia are grimly consistent under Hervé Renard, the only coach ever to win the African Cup of Nations with two different countries. They conceded a single goal in their 10 third-phase group games. No nation has anything approaching the depth of the world champions. The question with France really is over the wilful dourness of their coach, Didier Deschamps. It’s easy, of course, for outsiders to appeal for greater entertainment and to wonder whether a crop of players this gifted might not be producing more memorable football, but the performance at the last Euros suggested that Deschamps’s caution may be counterproductive. Jalel Kadri replaced Mondher Kebaier as Tunisia coach after the Cup of Nations and plenty of his squad have experience of playing in France. The bigger threat to France will come from Denmark, who won nine of their 10 qualifiers and have developed into a progressive and well-organised side with a ferocious team spirit forged in part in the aftermath of Christian Eriksen’s collapse in their first game at Euro 2020. The group will be completed by the UAE, Australia or Peru. There’s no doubting the most immediately attractive tie of the group stage: the clash of the 2010 and 2014 champions as Spain face Germany. After two dismal World Cup performances in a row, there is a sense that Spain are building again under Luis Enrique as he has introduced a more direct style. For Germany, the last World Cup was a major embarrassment, defeat to South Korea resulting in a first round exit for the first time in 80 years. Joachim Löw, who had struggled to rejuvenate his squad, probably should have left then, but hung around for a disappointing Euros. Since he has been replaced by Hansi Flick, though, Germany have excelled. Japan, who have a wealth of European experience in their squad, can feel a little unfortunate at yet another tough draw in their seventh successive World Cup appearance. The group is rounded off by the winner of the Costa Rica v New Zealand playoff. The golden generation is looking rather old now, but Belgium still qualified undefeated from their group. The biggest doubts are at the back, where Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld will have a combined age of 69 by the time the World Cup begins. Morocco are the fourth side Vahid Halilhodzic has led to the World Cup finals, but this might be the third time the famously difficult coach has lost his job before getting to the finals. Although Morocco had looked perhaps the best attacking side in the group stage at the Cup of Nations, he is feuding with Hakim Ziyech and is wildly unpopular. Croatia benefited from a relatively straightforward qualifying group, but the runners-up of four years ago remain dangerous so long as Luka Modric defies age. Canada’s only previous appearance came in 1986, but this squad is an entirely different level, led by Alphonso Davies of Bayern Munich and Jonathan David of Lille. It is 20 years since Brazil were the last non-European winner of a World Cup and again they are one of perhaps two non-European sides who might realistically be considered capable of success. Passing unbeaten through Conmebol qualifying is a remarkable achievement and Tite is an impressive coach, but the last World Cup and the quarter-final exit against Belgium was a reminder of the dangers of depending too much on Neymar. The group is perhaps best described as awkward rather than intimidating. Switzerland, now under Murat Yakin, are solid but over-reliant on Breel Embolo, while Dragan Stojkovic’s Serbia have attacking talent in Dusan Tadic, Aleksandar Mitrovic and Luka Jovic, but kept just one clean sheet in their eight qualifiers. Cameroon rather scrambled through, thanks to the ancient magic that means they can never lose to Algeria, and Rigobert Song’s side lean heavily on the goals of Vincent Aboubakar. This is perhaps the hardest group to call. It feels as if there are more questions than answers about Portugal who, despite finishing behind Serbia in the group, qualified comfortably enough, beating Turkey and North Macedonia in the playoffs. But there are doubts over Fernando Santos’s cautious tactics and the best permutation of their array of attacking talent. Uruguay are resurgent, having won all four qualifiers since Diego Alonso replaced Óscar Tabárez, whose 15-year reign as coach eventually ran out of steam last year. South Korea qualified convincingly under the former Portugal coach Paulo Bento, winning seven and drawing two of 10 third-phase qualifiers. Ghana were desperately poor at the Cup of Nations and topped their qualifying group thanks only to a highly debatable penalty against South Africa before beating Nigeria in their playoff on away goals. But the arrival of Otto Addo, initially as interim coach, brought calmness and resolve even in the cauldron of Abuja.",Sport/Football,World Cup draw: group-by-group analysis for Qatar 2022 | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/01/world-cup-draw-group-by-group-analysis-for-qatar-2022
4/2/2022,"The Grampians (Gariwerd) national park is a rugged wilderness of striking sandstone mountain ranges, expansive grasslands, windswept ridges and dense bush located in the highlands of western Victoria, three hours drive from Melbourne. When I heard they were creating a new multi-day hike that would stretch the entire 160km length of the Grampians – the Grampians Peaks Trails (GPT) – I knew I wanted to experience it as soon as possible. Luckily for me, Parks Victoria had seen the Guardian’s previous hyperlapse video showcasing the Bondi-to-Manly walk, and were happy to see if it would be possible to create something similar on a larger scale. The entire GPT clocks in at a lengthy 160km from end-to-end, but I only had a week off in which to hike and capture the footage I needed. Hours poring over topographic maps and meetings with Parks Victoria were required to come up with a condensed itinerary that would hit all the major highlights of the trail. Some days were dropped, some days were combined, but in the end we concocted an arduous 120km version of the trail I could complete over seven days. I combined the first two days of the hike, two of the hardest days, into one gigantic, 10-hour, bulging blister of a day, arriving at Gar campsite in the pouring ran as it grew dark, and feeling like I had bitten off more than I could chew. But after that baptism of fire, my hiking legs took hold. One of the best parts about a long hike like the GPT is how it affords you the opportunity to immerse yourself in a variety of ever-changing landscapes as you meander up and down the mountain ranges. Ironically, the memory from my GPT experience that will stay with me forever didn’t make it into the hyperlapse due to the limitations of the camera in low-light. I woke up on the final morning to the most incredible cloud inversion I’ve ever seen. After a night of howling winds where I only slept a couple of hours, I awoke to absolute silence and the sun rising up over a sea of clouds. By the final day of my condensed GPT, I felt like I could continue on for another week … although I was happy to finish off the hike with a beer back in Halls Gap. A timelapse is a photographic technique by which the capture rate of a sequence of frames is much slower than the speed in which they are played back. You’re manipulating time to show – in only a few seconds – events that may take several minutes, days or even weeks. Adding movement to the camera is the next step in the process, turning a stationary timelapse into a hyperlapse. Now we are not only speeding up time, we’re also changing the point of view. In the case of a hiking hyperlapse, we’re now able to give a creative interpretation of our experience walking incredibly long distances. I utilised the same techniques for creating this hyperlapse as I did for the Bondi-to-Manly hyperlapse – that is, stick a 360º camera in a backpack and go walking. But that was where the similarities ended. Every aspect of the GPT hyperlapse was harder than the Bondi-to-Manly. For starters, I didn’t have the two most iconic examples of Australian architecture – the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge – to use as a crutch. To compensate for this I wanted to get more ambitious with camera movement, going so far as to tape the 360º camera to a drone so the hyperlapse would seamlessly take to the air over the orange rock of Taipan Wall. The sheer length of the hike and remoteness of some sections meant batteries and memory cards were a constant concern. Disaster also struck when a rock scratched one of the two ultra-wide lenses on the third day. Luckily the damage didn’t affect the functioning of the camera, and I was able to continue recording. But for the rest of the hike I had to hold the selfie-stick and camera in front of me like a standard bearer in a marching parade. The longest part of this project is also the worst part – post-production. Long gone is the excitement and joy of the hike … now is the time of sitting in front of a computer screen at ungodly hours, painstakingly moving keyframes around while you begin to question your choices in life. The biggest difficulty arose when I started going through the footage. What I didn’t consider is that the majority of the Bondi-to-Manly is on paved footpaths, boardwalks or flat beaches – this allows for a consistency of footfall that I never appreciated. That consistency creates a smoother passage when the footage is sped up. The majority of the Grampians Peaks Trail is on uneven, or even steep and difficult terrain. Of course, this ruggedness is one of the main attractions of the GPT, but when you’re trying to create a hyperlapse it can be a nightmare. Not only do you need to smooth out spatial shakes and movements, but you need to think about stabilisation temporally as well. Little pauses to catch a breath, adjust a pack or climb over a steep rock all need to be smoothed out by making an edit and then adjusting the two new clips to match each other. Making these hyperlapse videos is such a fun creative process … you don’t really know what you have until you have finished the trail. They’re much more rough around the edges than traditional content you might see promoting an outdoor experience. I’ve got my eye on a few more possibilities in the year ahead: Tassie … I’m looking at you.",Lifestyle/Travel,Hyperlapse video: hiking the epic Grampians Peaks Trail in 5.5 minutes,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/apr/01/hyperlapse-video-hiking-the-epic-grampians-peaks-trail-in-55-minutes
4/2/2022,"On Wednesday night, as the New South Wales parliament debated a bill that makes blocking roads in the state a jail-worthy offence, the independent MP for Sydney, Alex Greenwich, asked, rhetorically, what had prompted the government’s urgency to pass the legislation. The bill had been introduced into the parliament late on Wednesday afternoon, with the Coalition providing a one-page brief and no forewarning to the crossbench. While the Greens tried twice to delay the bill – first in the lower house on Wednesday, then launching an upper house filibuster until late Thursday – the government then passed a special adjournment which saw the house sit again on Friday. Just after 3pm the bill passed the upper house and went back downstairs for assent. It means that, in NSW, anyone who “seriously disrupts or obstructs vehicles or pedestrians” on a major road or at major infrastructure facilities such as ports and railway lines could be jailed for up to two years. The definition of a major road remains unclear. It will be whatever the minister deems it to be under the regulations guiding the legislation. So, to go back to Greenwich’s question, why the urgency? Well, he had a theory. Last week the acting premier, Paul Toole, held two chest-thumping press conferences on the same day to announce crackdowns on climate activists who had disrupted operations at Port Botany. They followed a series of other protests which had seen peak-hour traffic stopped on Manly’s busy Spit Bridge by demonstrators. Toole announced increased punishment for people who blocked bridges or tunnels, which he was able to do by extending a regulation which already applied to Sydney’s Harbour Bridge. The legislation announced this week was an extension of those punishments to apply more broadly to road, port and rail infrastructure. The announcements happened to come on the same day that 2GB host Ben Fordham had slammed the government for failing to “act” on the “morons” and “idiots” blockading the port. And on the same day that Sydney tabloid the Daily Telegraph ran a story under the headline: “Throw the book at these blockheads”. Greenwich called the bill a response to “shock jocks and tabloid newspapers”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We are dealing with this bill because political leaders gave quick grabs at press conferences that they are trying to back up,” he said. “Tonight is NSW parliament at its worst. It is when the Daily Telegraph and 2GB form our policy, policy that we will regret down the track.” Which is, in many ways, no great revelation. Someone once described political media in NSW to me as a sort of reactionary momentum machine, where an issue that irks a 2GB host becomes grist for the Telegraph which is then picked up on by commercial television and hey presto greyhound racing is legal again. But it does help put the rapid-fire way this bill moved through parliament into context. Which brings us to Labor. The opposition leader, Chris Minns, had made it known that Labor supported a crackdown on climate activists on the same day Toole held his press conference double feature last week, calling protesters’ actions “damaging” to the cause for action on the climate crisis. “They’re not disrupting billionaire coal barons, they’re actually hitting ordinary Australians who are just going about their work,” he said at the time. Which is not a completely outrageous thing to say. But when Labor indicated it would support not just the extension of the regulation, but also the legislation to broaden the offence, it prompted an angry response from the unions, who have been known to blockade a thing or two in their time. The head of Unions NSW, Mark Morey, called the bill “unacceptable”, and urged the parliament to “pause and reconsider”. Labor’s decision to support the bill has also angered some of its MPs on the backbench. Labor’s shadow attorney general, Michael Daley, had only been told the bill was coming on Tuesday night, and it was not taken to the party room before the announcment it would support the bill. It was, of course, the dreaded wedge, in which Labor finds itself caught between appealing to self-appointed representatives of the common-sense brigade such as Fordham or taking a stand on a matter of principle, even if it’s unpopular. As Labor’s upper house MP Rose Jackson said during the debate on the bill, “I sometimes think, ‘this is why the left cannot have nice things’.” A year out from the election, the opposition has decided a fight on protest laws is not in its best interests. But the government – and its allies in the media – know Labor does not want to be talking about these issues. It’s unlikely to be the last time before next March we see a bill that seeks to put the opposition in the same uncomfortable position. It will be interesting to watch how Minns handles it.",News/Australia news,NSW protest bill leaves Labor wedged between a roadblock and a hard place,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/02/nsw-protest-bill-leaves-labor-wedged-between-a-roadblock-and-a-hard-place
4/2/2022,"Both of Victoria’s political leaders were stuck at home this week – Daniel Andrews having tested positive for Covid-19 and Matthew Guy as a close contact of his nine-year-old son. But it probably wouldn’t have made much of a difference if they weren’t. After seven very busy years, the most reformist government in the country has only announced – and stuck to – one new, major policy initiative in 2022. There are several reasons for this. First, the upper house has become a much more difficult place for the government to pass legislation. With the defection of former government minister Adem Somyurek and his factional ally Kaushaliya Vaghela to the crossbench, Labor only has 16 MPs in the 40-seat upper house. Without the support of the opposition, it now requires five other independents to pass legislation. The government can no longer rely on the votes of Fiona Patten, Andy Meddick and Samantha Ratnam alone – it burned some bridges with the rest of the crossbench last year when it only consulted with the trio on its pandemic bill. While the pandemic bill became a lightning rod for anti-lockdown and anti-vaccination groups, who occupied the steps of state parliament for weeks, the government cannot afford another such display. Also, all eyes have been on Canberra and the federal budget, as well as an election to be called as early as the weekend. It makes little sense for the state leaders to fight for air time with their federal counterparts. Indeed, Victorian MPs from across the political spectrum have all expressed the need for clean air between the federal and state elections. Some Labor MPs have questioned whether the state budget should go ahead on 3 May, given its proximity to the possible federal election dates of 14 or 21 May. Several Victorian Liberals, meanwhile, have privately suggested a need for distance between the federal and state party “brands”, given the prime minister Scott Morrison’s unpopularity in the state. Some have said a Morrison loss would actually be best for their chances at the state poll, though Guy disputes this. Which brings us to the 26 November election. It’s not new for a government to avoid legislation that could be controversial in the final year of its term. When it comes to big change, governments need time to consult with stakeholders and the community, allay any concerns and then spruik the results. This is why the level crossing removal project is seen as so successful electorally. It was promised at the 2014 election, construction began in the first year of the Andrews government’s term and several were completed before the 2018 election. Commuters benefited from more trains, drivers from less traffic. Without time, the government is open to political attacks. This is largely why the government dumped a policy to tax property developers in order to fund social housing just 10 days after it was announced in February. Labor MPs feared it handed the opposition a golden opportunity to target the government over housing affordability. Its trial of sick leave for casuals, on the other hand, has broad support. Meanwhile, the opposition has released a 44-page document in February outlining its key principles to “make Victoria number one again”, which largely contains earlier announcements. Its policy backflips – it is now supporting the government’s plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030 and its mental health levy on big businesses – have received more attention. So what would’ve happened this week if Andrews and Guy weren’t isolating? No doubt they both would’ve commented on the federal budget. Perhaps Andrews would’ve said the state got a shabby deal – and in terms of new money it has – just 5.9%, or $208m, out of a total $3.56bn worth of new infrastructure funding over the four-year budget period has been allocated to Victoria. It is also the only state without a city deal with the commonwealth and has been left out of a $7.1bn regional economies fund. Instead, we had ministers James Merlino and Danny Pearson describing the budget as “deeply disappointing” and “bad for Victorians”, respectively. Perhaps Guy would’ve used the same line he did on Monday, when he said the state’s transport infrastructure minister, Jacinta Allan, needed to “grow up” and stop blaming the federal government and treating it “like an ATM”. There would’ve been commentary from both leaders on the state’s ambulance crisis – another code red was called on Tuesday night due to high demand, and then a day later, an inquiry into Ambulance Victoria’s culture found the emergency service was a “boys club” that excluded women and people from diverse backgrounds from career progression. But if the Andrews government is serious about reform, there’s more to do. An inquiry into the state’s criminal justice system last week found bail laws strengthened after the murder of Jill Meagher and the 2017 Bourke Street massacre have led to a rise in the number of low-level offenders in prison on remand who would not otherwise be there. Aboriginal Victorians, young people and women are disproportionately affected. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Aboriginal women made up 14% of the total female prison population in 2020 despite Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people making up less than 0.8% of the Victorian population. Among the inquiry’s 100 recommendations is to review the laws and raise the age of criminal responsibility from 10 to 14. Several MPs within the Labor party are known to support such reforms. A mother of three, known to the inquiry as “Amy”, gave evidence that she was misidentified as an aggressor during a family violence incident, arrested and denied bail. She pleaded guilty and was released after 120 days in jail. She lost custody of two of her children, her home and career.

4/2/2022,"This year, Saturday 2 April is the first day of Ramadan and the start of a month’s fasting for most Australian Muslims. Over recent years, breaking the fast at nightly iftar meals with neighbours, colleagues and the wider community has become a special tradition in multicultural countries like Australia. For the Muslim community, it’s an opportunity to invite others into their lives, to share food, hospitality and conversation – and for those of us who are not Muslim, an invitation is an opportunity to better our understanding of other cultures and traditions and to build lasting friendships. Recipes for Ramadan started as a community response to Covid-19. An unprecedented lockdown Ramadan in 2020 meant that community prayer, events and invitations to break the day’s fast with extended family and friends were suddenly all impossible, leaving a huge gap to fill. Sharing recipes and family stories online became an alternative way to extend an invitation; an opportunity to delve into family histories from Australia’s diverse Muslim cultures, and explore the wider social and political events behind them. Covid still casts a shadow but its legacy is a collection of over 50 recipes and stories from more than 20 countries – with more to come. Ramadan Mubarak. – Jane Jeffes, founder, Recipes for Ramadan Fruit chaat, or spiced fruit chaat, is one of those essential dishes on every Pakistani iftar table in Ramadan. It’s super simple to make – just diced up seasonal fresh fruit tossed with salt, sugar and chaat masala, plus a squeeze of lemon to prevent the fruit from browning and orange juice for a hint of tartness. Think of it as a refreshing palate cleanser to counter the traditional Pakistani iftar fried items of pakoras, samosas, spring rolls and chicken patties. Chaat masala is the magical ingredient that transforms a simple fruit salad. Recipes for the spice mix vary from family to family, and on how it will be used. Some will be spicier and savoury, and some will have more tang. My recipe is on the tangy and tart side, and it is something I make every year before Ramadan starts. As the spices roast, the house fills with fragrant warmth. But if you don’t have time to make your own, chaat masala spice mix is fairly easy to buy – in Pakistani and Indian grocery stores or in the international aisle of large supermarkets. Shan and National are brands that I regularly use. If you really don’t have time to make or buy the spice mix, you can even substitute it with black pepper, salt and a little lemon juice. Growing up, all of us siblings had roles and responsibilities assigned to us in the month of Ramadan. Once I was old enough to properly use a knife and had figured out the basics of chopping, my mother gave me the fruit chaat. I would prepare it in the afternoon when the entire house was asleep, sitting on the dining table chopping while I watched television. At first, the fruit was mismatched and disproportionate, but as time went on, my cutting skills became more uniform. I also became better at estimating the spices and seasoning to add. The thing with Ramadan is that since we are fasting, we can’t taste the food we’re preparing, so it’s only when we take the first bite after we break the fast that we discover whether the sweetness level is correct. In Pakistan, the most popular fruit for fruit chaat are guavas, pears, apples and bananas, supplemented with seasonal fruit depending on when Ramadan falls. The Islamic calendar is lunar, which is why the month of Ramadan moves forward by about two weeks every year. My first Ramadan in Australia, I couldn’t figure out what fruit to use. It was winter and the fruit in the supermarket was exotic compared with what I was used to in Karachi. In Pakistan, apples are either red or green. Grapes have seeds. Blueberries, raspberries, kiwi fruit, nectarines, black and red grapes aren’t common. Even the way fruit is purchased was different. In Pakistan, we buy by the kilogram – no one buys just one apple! Even though things were different here, I still had to have fruit chaat at my iftar table, so I experimented. This is what I have learnt about making fruit chaat in Australia: Out of all the apples available, pink lady works best. It’s crisp and firm and has the right tang-to-sweetness ratio. Just add lemon juice so it doesn’t discolour. Pears don’t need to be peeled, but they do need to be ripe and sweet. Stone fruit like nectarines and peaches are delicious in a fruit chaat. Nectarines don’t need to be peeled but peaches can be peeled if you don’t like the slightly furry skin. They should neither be too firm nor too soft. Kiwi fruit adds a lovely hint of green. When adding grapes, cut them in half or quarters. Use a mix of grapes (red, black and green) for colour. If you are lucky, guavas are available at Pakistani or Asian stores. They are pricier, but for me, worth the expense once in a blue moon for the memories they evoke. Fruit chaat is also a great way to finish the fruit in the house in a quick and easy manner. No one eats that lonely apple in the fruit basket, but the moment it’s converted into fruit chaat, it gets devoured instantly. Lastly, there are no rules in fruit chaat. Feel free to experiment and find your favourite fruit combination. Below is the recipe for the fruit chaat I’ll be making this Ramadan with Australia’s autumn fruits. Serves 4 peoplePrep 20 minutes For the chaat masala spice mix(Can alternatively be bought from the supermarket)1 tbsp cumin seeds½ tbsp coriander seeds¾ tbsp dry mango powder (amchoor powder)¼ tbsp black salt, can be substituted with Himalayan pink salt or sea salt1 tsp red chilli powder2-3 black peppercorns For the fruit chaat(Adjust based on seasonal availability and personal preference)1 small apple, cored and diced1 pear, cored and diced1 peach or nectarine, peeled, cored and diced8-10 strawberries, cored and sliced (can be chopped as well)½ cup seedless grapes, cut lengthwise or into quarters (depending on the size of the grapes)8-10 cherries, cored and diced (optional)1 mandarin or small orange, peeledLemon juice (to prevent fruit from oxidising) For the seasoning4 tbsp sugar (adjust to personal preference)1½-2 tsp chaat masala (adjust to personal preference)¼–½ cup orange juice To make the spice mix, dry roast cumin and coriander seeds in a small frying pan until lightly toasted and aromatic. Wait for them to cool, then pulse in a spice grinder with the black peppercorns until coarsely ground. Add the remaining ingredients and pulse again to mix through. Chaat masala can be stored in the pantry in an airtight container. To make the fruit chaat, place the diced apple in a bowl. Add a squeeze of lemon juice to prevent the apple from oxidising. Cut around the mandarin (or orange) to remove the peel and white pith. Remove and discard any pips. Cut the flesh into segments and then dice small, so that the citrus is the same size as the other fruit. Place the cut citrus in the same bowl as the apple, add the rest of the fruit and toss together gently. Add sugar, chaat masala and orange juice, and stir, mixing well to combine. If you’re not fasting, taste and adjust seasonings – or do this just before you serve. Depending on the combination of fruits used, the sugar and chaat masala quantity may need to be adjusted. The fruit chaat can be served immediately. However, it’s best served chilled. Keep in the fridge for about 30 minutes to let the flavours meld together and create a delicious fruit juice in the bottom of the bowl. Leftover fruit chaat can be kept in the fridge for up to two days. However, the fruit chaat can get soft and discoloured, depending on the fruits used. Fruit chaat made from firm fruit such as apples and pears lasts longer. If bananas are used, it gets mushy and soft quickly. After a date or two and a few sips of water, lentil soup is a popular choice to break your Ramadan fast. There are different recipes, but ours is part of our family’s DNA and we serve it not just during Ramadan but throughout the colder months. This soup reminds us of our mandatory weekly family get-togethers, every single Saturday. Those nights have been a weekly event since our paternal grandparents came out here from war-torn Lebanon in the late 1960s, and they still hold great significance for us. They’re a regular time to connect and catch up, to celebrate and also, sadly, sometimes to grieve together. Our family comes from a village called Bakhoun, in the mountains near Tripoli in the north of Lebanon. It’s a beautiful spot. There are lots of big villas and holiday homes that people visit to escape the heat in summer and for snow in winter. Bakhoun has a very strong sense of community and our grandparents maintained this when they moved to Sydney. Our grandfather’s name was Judu Ali and our father’s mother, our grandmother, was known to us as Tayta Aisha. The recipe for this soup was hers and she was always the one who served it. Tayta owned the ladle! We can all still picture the repetitive motion, serving bowl after bowl after bowl. When we think of our grandparents, we think of this soup. When we were growing up, we felt it was the ultimate comfort food, warm and hearty. Now that we have families of our own, we serve it to them with freshly oven-baked crusty bread and a squeeze of lemon, which according to our late grandparents will ward off the cold and flu. We have tweaked the recipe a little, by blitzing the soup smooth with our stick blenders, when traditionally it was served rustic and coarse. Our own families have come to prefer the smoother and creamier texture – but we suggest you try both and let your family decide. 2 cups red lentils, washed and drained⅓ cup medium grain rice, washed and drained4 chicken stock cubes8 cups water2 medium brown onions, finely diced4 cloves garlic, crushed1 bunch coriander, washed and finely chopped2 tbsp clarified butter/ghee (Allowrie is our favourite)1 tbsp tomato paste1 tbsp red pepper pasteSalt to season In a pot add lentils, rice, stock cubes and water. Bring to the boil and simmer for approximately 45 minutes. Whilst soup is simmering, add butter to a pan and heat. Add the onions and cook until golden brown, then add garlic and stir for a further minute. Add tomato paste, red pepper paste and coriander to the pan and cook off for further two minutes. Once the soup is cooked, you have two options. For a creamy texture, puree the soup with a stick blender, then add the onion mixture, or for a coarser soup, add the onion mixture to the lentils and rice when they are soft and cooked through.

4/2/2022,"The prime minister’s office has been ordered to search for text messages from Barnaby Joyce to Scott Morrison reporting on his work as drought envoy, in the second ruling this week on freedom of information battles involving Morrison’s phone. On Wednesday, the information watchdog ordered the PMO search Morrison’s phone for text messages from his friend – the prominent QAnon supporter Tim Stewart – after the PMO refused a request made by Guardian Australia. The acting information commissioner, Elizabeth Hampton has taken a similar approach to a freedom of information request for text messages from the deputy prime minister while he was in the role of drought envoy. For nine months between 2018 and 2019, while Joyce was on the backbench, he served as a drought envoy, visiting and reporting back on drought-affected communities, accruing $675,000 in travel costs in that time. After criticism from Labor that no public report on his work was produced, Joyce said he had sent reports via text message. “If you say a report is a written segment to the prime minister … then they definitely went to him, I definitely sent them, I sent them by SMS to him and they were read,” Joyce told the ABC in September 2019. Tom Swann, then Australia Institute senior researcher, and Guardian Australia filed separate freedom of information requests for those text message “reports”. However, in October 2019, the PMO refused the requests for the texts between Joyce and Morrison “regarding his work as drought envoy” by claiming it “would substantially and unreasonably interfere with the prime minister’s functions”. Joyce said publicly he had sent an “awful lot” of reports via text message to the prime minister’s phone and that he would be “happy” to release the messages, but it was not his call. Swann appealed against the decision to the Office of the Australian information commissioner, and two and a half years later, the acting commissioner, Elizabeth Hampton, has ordered the prime minister’s office to process the request in 30 days, finding the request could not be practically refused. Swann argued the messages could be downloaded to avoid affecting the PM’s functions, and as the only record of Joyce’s work as drought envoy, the text messages were official documents of a minister under the freedom of information act. The PMO erroneously claimed Swann was seeking two years’ worth of text messages, and would not provide the information commissioner with a breakdown of the 50 hours it estimated would take to process the request. “I am not satisfied that PMO’s estimate of the processing time is reasonable.” The ruling is near-identical to the decision Hampton made regarding the 2019 text messages between Morrison and Tim Stewart.

In Senate estimates on Thursday, the finance minister, Simon Birmingham, said he did not believe a decision had been made on whether to appeal against the Guardian Australia ruling to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The prime minister’s office has not responded to a request for comment. However, if there is a change of government before the cases advance, FoI law expert Peter Timmins said that would make it unlikely the text messages would ever be handed over. “If … we have a different prime minister there by the time this issue is moved ahead, it’s very unlikely that records of [that kind] will be passed to the new prime minister, which would mean that you’ve run into a dead end,” he said.",News/Australia news,"Barnaby Joyce’s drought envoy texts to Scott Morrison should be released, information watchdog rules",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/02/barnaby-joyces-drought-envoy-texts-to-scott-morrison-should-be-released-information-watchdog-rules
4/2/2022,"I’ve lived near Lismore for 15 years. During the town’s first floods, I took cupcakes to an evacuation centre and asked if they accepted homemade goods. The answer: “We don’t, put them there, they’ll be great for morning tea.” The official line was no, then came a wink and nod because all highways were cut and food was scare. It reminded me of the SES call early on 28 February for private boat owners to help rescue those stranded in inundated properties. Within an hour it was cancelled, but hundreds of tinnie owners were already on their way. The community’s response to the floods could be described as a DIY model of emergency management. Maybe it began with the “mud army”, who clean buildings in flood-prone towns. Australians have a history of volunteering as natural disaster responders – look at the Country Fire Authority and the Rural Fire Service. Perhaps it comes from the colonial mindset of taming a seemingly wild land, but as we Europeans have settled into and dominated the environment, volunteering has declined. In Lismore the prime minister said: “In any natural disaster, everyone has a role to play ... there will be a community response in disasters such as this because the community is already there.” Yet a consequence of the emergency response to these floods is that many have lost faith in the state’s ability to protect them, even with large numbers of emergency personnel now on the ground. On Tuesday Anastacia Gunn and Carol Evans were at Lismore’s Wilson River checking the gauge, counting down metres until levee breach and looking at the water. They did this several times in the day because they didn’t want to “just rely” on the Bureau of Meteorology. Carol’s house was inundated in February. She had only a couple of hours to evacuate. The SES lifted the Lismore CBD evacuation order at 4.30pm on Tuesday, only to reintroduce it nine hours later. Many question whether meteorological and hydrological forecasting models are effective in extreme weather events. There’s a feeling that climate change has moved the goal posts but scientists, emergency workers and the government haven’t caught up. “Things aren’t happening in a way that they’re familiar to anymore,” said Aiden Ricketts, who, in his tinnie, rescued 18 people. There was an emotional exchange between a local journalist and Scott Morrison during the PM’s visit, with the journo yelling: “Australians couldn’t get through on triple zero, mate.” I was surprised a regional journalist had these expectations in a crisis. My attitude is shaped by the Black Summer bushfires. On 8 November, when a record 17 fires in New South Wales were at the emergency warning level, I was briefly trapped by a fallen tree before the RFS cleared the path. I listened as units called for backup to save towns and I spoke to residents fighting to save their homes. My place hasn’t been destroyed by floods. The roof leaked after 430mm of rain fell in one night. My daughter is in year 12. Her school is destroyed. I have friends who are homeless. Some are OK, some aren’t. I’m not that interested in questions around the PM’s decision not to declare a national emergency after the levee was first breached. It feels like a debate about whether the Titanic’s deckchairs were in the right spot. The bigger climate change questions engage me, ie should Australia have a jobkeeper payment for people whose jobs are lost in disasters, or land swaps for people left homeless, or a state insurance for high-risk properties, or an ADF special climate response branch? And what form will new volunteer organisations take – the paramilitary model of the RFS or community controlled? Lismore resident and incoming Greens state upper house member Sue Higginson has called on the government to acknowledge it is failing to keep the community safe: “We need to understand that our systems are not able right now in their current form to navigate what we’re facing.” She described Lismore residents as “pioneers” on a new climate change landscape. As climate change pioneers, communities it seems will be called on to respond to disasters that overwhelm emergency services – much like the 19th-century pioneers who established the CFA/RFS. The Koori Mail has set up a Lismore recovery hub – that started with a marquee with a box of vegetables, and is coordinated by Dunghutti and Nyangbal-Arakwal woman Naomi Moran. It offers groceries and hot food, and has a doctor on-site. Russell Scott, who runs a stall there, watched the volunteers ahead of Wednesday’s flood. “Within six hours, this place was emptied thanks to the support of the volunteers, thanks basically to the angels who just arrived,” he said. “It was amazing to see it all packed up. There was no fighting, no squabbling, everybody just worked together and did everything for the good of the people.”  Christine Tondorf is a freelance journalist from the north coast of New South Wales",Opinion/Opinion,Lismore residents’ flood response was a DIY model of emergency management,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/02/lismore-residents-flood-response-was-a-diy-model-of-emergency-management
4/2/2022,"When Liang’s* landlords told her last year that they were going to sell the house she lived in, they gave her more notice than most – a full six months. It was the only thing that allowed her to get ahead. “I was scared,” Liang told Guardian Australia. “In my local area people were posting [on social media] that they’d applied for 50 houses and been knocked back for all of them. I’m not even in a two-income family. I was worried about becoming homeless.” So Liang, 49, who works in hospital-based healthcare in Melbourne, started saving as much as she could. “I found this property and I got the impression there were over 50 applicants for this one place. As a single mother, I don’t think I was at the top of the list but I wrote a cover letter for my application and within it I said I could give three months rent in advance,” Liang said. “I worked so, so hard to save up … It was recommended I do this because there is so much competition.” Her new landlord eventually told her she didn’t need to pay that rent in advance, but prices had risen so much in general that Liang was paying $450 more a month for the house she now lives in with her three children than she had been in the old one. Tenants around Australia are straining under the weight of pandemic-era rent rises, with triple digit increases in parts of regional New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria, and costs of living soaring beyond the reach of wage increases. Single parents, 82% of whom are sole-parenting mothers, are particularly feeling the strain. For Melanie*, who moved back in with her parents in the Blue Mountains after her relationship ended, the hunt for somewhere to live in the area has been going on for 12 months. “Generally you get told there are 60 other applicants for every house,” she said. “And of course, being a single mum, you don’t really have a competitive edge compared to a lot of couples.” Melanie said she was expecting to have to pay $500 a week – about 58% of the approximately $850 a week that she was able to bring in through a combination of Centrelink payments, which meant appropriate houses were “severely unaffordable”, according to the schema provided by the Rental Affordability Index. Finding a house that would suit her and her two primary school-age children for less than that was tough, she said. “I also have a dog, so that makes things a little bit more difficult, because a lot of people discriminate against pets,” Melanie said. “But I couldn’t get rid of her. My kids and I would be devastated.” Giving up the family pet is just one of the unthinkable choices that families are being forced to make, not out of desire but desperation thanks to skyrocketing rents, said Terese Edwards, chief executive of the National Council of Single Mothers and their Children. “I think [the rental market] is the most bleak and fierce that I’ve witnessed in over 12 years,” said Edwards. “Vacancies are incredibly minimal, there is a lot of competition for them, and a lot of time and emotion is spent trying to find secure accommodation. I’m hearing from a lot of women who have already really reduced their needs and ambitions, and they are still missing out.” Parenthood has knock-on effects on the incomes and tenancy options for many women, particularly those who may have taken time off from work in order to look after children, or who don’t have recent rental histories, having either left a relationship in which they owned property as a couple – with assets often whittled away due to protracted family court proceedings – or not having been a signatory to a previous lease. In these cases, women can have trouble proving they are able to pay the rent, or demonstrating any kind of rental history. Women who left abusive relationships also said that the trauma and complications of that process affected their ability to work, and therefore their tenancy applications. Liang said she would prefer to have a permanent part-time job, and was even offered one by her employer, but could not accept it, as she needed the flexibility of casual work to be able to drop shifts to manage the administrative and emotional burdens of navigating her ex-partner’s ongoing demands of her. “Domestic violence rules my life. There are times when I can’t actually work because I’m too distressed dealing with this stuff,” said Liang. “When things like this happen, you can’t function. These things cripple you, they just mentally cripple you.” In these times, Liang falls back on Centrelink payments, but this comes with added complications. “They insist that I have to come in and find a job. I have a job, I don’t need help finding a job, but they don’t hear that, they insist I come in and apply for jobs,” Liang said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Edwards said housing needed to be “front and centre” of the forthcoming federal election. “I don’t think the initiatives coming out have really targeted those most in need,” she said, pointing to the huge gap in affordable housing stock, especially since the phase-out of the National Rental Affordability Scheme, and the long waiting lists for social housing. Those juggling single parenthood and financial hardship needed more affordable housing options and government subsidies to help them manage basic costs, Edwards said. “For instance, we need to look at how we can better support people who are living in hardship to actually move house, so that they don’t go to a payday lender for the removalist, or throw their items out because they can’t afford to move them.” Incentives for landlords to lease to families with dependent children would also help, Edwards said. “That would go some way towards challenging discrimination but also keeping kids out of homelessness.” * Names have been changed",News/Australia news,‘There are 60 other applicants for every house’: the rental crisis pushing single mothers to extremes,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/02/there-are-60-other-applicants-for-every-house-the-rental-crisis-pushing-single-mothers-to-extremes
4/2/2022,"Memoir, Allen & Unwin, $49.99 Hannah Gadsby is known for deconstructing comedy, so it’s apt that her memoir begins with an epilogue: the protagonist is feeling completely out of place at her first Emmys party in Hollywood, being complimented by John Stamos, photographed by Jodie Foster and summoned by Jennifer Aniston, who draws Gadsby through the crowd just so she star can tell her, “with the rhythm of a compliment”, that she never watched Nanette. Gadsby is still reeling from that “deliberately miserable” 2018 Netflix comedy special, which catapulted her to global fame. The months that followed, she writes, were “amongst the strangest and most unsettling of my life”. Her long-awaited memoir opens proper with her similarly fish-out-of-water childhood, in the small town of Smithton in Tasmania’s north-west. She’s an open, insightful and moreish writer, who chronicles her school years, her craft and her career while touching on pop culture, politics, mental health and autism. That description makes this book sound much less funny than it is. – Steph Harmon Nonfiction, Pan Macmillan Australia, $34.99 In The Most Important Job in the World, the journalist Gina Rushton grapples with a question many millennials now face: whether or not to bring a child into the world, particularly given the prospect of accelerating climate breakdown. Informed by her extensive reporting on these topics, Rushton examines reproductive politics and the ethics, labour and legacies of motherhood in a synthesis of reportage and essay. The result is a compassionate and poetic consideration of becoming a parent, a decision that – regardless of the outcome – engenders a reckoning with personal desire and collective responsibility. – Donna Lu Memoir, UQP, $32.99 The break-up of a friendship can be painful and toxic, lingering for years like a small bomb in your gut. But so few of our stories focus on these fractures, favouring romantic heartbreak instead. Patti Miller has set out to tip the scales. Miller recently lost a long, deep friendship – and she wanted to work out what happened. In the most moreish parts of True Friends, she forensically pulls apart her memories of it – the moments of joy, of spite; the texts and emails. But this book is more than just voyeurism – it’s a relatable celebration of all the different female friendships that shaped her life. She chronicles their beginnings and endings while owning her faults as a narrator so coloured by emotion and memory that she can’t possibly be telling the whole truth. It’s all the more honest for it. – Steph Harmon Novel, Affirm Press, $32.99 This enjoyably grimey novel follows Lily and Janks, two former addicts who live paycheck to paycheck in Melbourne’s inner suburbs, struggling tirelessly to escape the shadow of their past habits, and to give Lily’s teenage daughter, Jewelee, a better life. When Janks is given an ultimatum by a group of local bikies – one last job, all debts forgiven – he disappears, leaving Lily to desperately search for him. O’Reilly has an earthly way with words: everything is dunnies and guts, skanky junkies and derros. There are flashes of lyricism that linger in the mind: a revving car’s “beefy engine bucking”, “ghostly cockatoos bicker and scream”. Swapping as it does between Lily’s and Janks’s points of view, Other Houses zips along at a pace: this is a book to read in one sitting, if you can. – Sian Cain Cook book, Hardie Grant, $55 With their crispy, lace edges and rich, runny yolk centres, O Tama Carey’s egg hoppers are a rare blend of comfort and sophistication. In her debut cookbook, the chef behind Lankan Filling Station in Sydney shares the twisty, funny backstory of how she came to master them, along with detailed instructions for those game enough to try it at home. This book’s great strength is its combination of personable warmth and technical precision. Read it like a novel, and you’ll come away with a grasp on the basics of Sri Lankan cooking, and perhaps even the confidence to experiment. But you can also just scan it to cherrypick recipes, from project cooks like hoppers to fast, flavourful dishes too. – Alyx Gorman Nonfiction, Text Publishing, $34.99 Kate Grenville’s most recent novel, A Room Made of Leaves, opened with a playful conceit; in a preface, Grenville positioned herself as “transcriber and editor” of a recently discovered, secret manuscript by Elizabeth Macarthur, the wife of the infamous early settler colonist John Macarthur. Now Grenville has taken on that role of editor for real, collecting Macarthur’s actual letters recounting her life in the early days of the colony. The twist here is Grenville’s fascinating speculation that Macarthur’s letters are themselves a form of fiction, designed to conceal harsh truths about her life behind conventional, lady-like expressions. Grenville’s editorial asides allow the reader to glimpse something of the possible reality that lies beneath, and offer a window into the complexity of Grenville’s relationship with this compelling, difficult and sometimes “unattractive” muse. – Kirsten Tranter Memoir, Ultimo Press, $34.99 The British-Australian academic Dr Kylie Moore-Gilbert spent 804 days as a defiant hostage to Iran’s hardline Revolutionary Guards, falsely accused of being a spy. Moments in her memoir The Uncaged Sky will leave readers breathless. The sheer terror, uncertainty and gnawing dread of a brutal regime closing in all around: blindfolds and handcuffs, interrogations and isolation. Powerfully and artfully written, the book has moments of joy shining through: the loving friendships made inside prison; the exhilaration of “escaping” to that uncaged sky, standing on the prison roof; and the strength Moore-Gilbert found to defy her captors amid the ceaseless cruelty of her incarceration. – Ben Doherty",Arts/Books,The best Australian books out in April: what we’re reading this month,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/02/the-best-australian-books-out-in-april-what-were-reading-this-month
4/2/2022,"Mithali Raj and Smriti Mandhana, both world top-10 ODI batters, are at the crease. Mithali, the India captain, drives an in-swinger from Anya Shrubsole low to point, and the ball dips in front of Sophia Dunkley as she throws herself forward for the catch. The review captures Dunkley’s fingers beneath the ball: “I’m satisfied,” pronounces the third umpire. A wave of joy breaks over the gathered England fielders. They’re satisfied, too. Was this the moment England’s women turned their hitherto disastrous World Cup campaign around? Or was it in Shrubsole’s next over, when Kate Cross ran from cover to mid-off and hit the stumps, as Deepti Sharma tried to get off the mark? Was it, perhaps, when Charlie Dean took a wicket with the first ball of only her second one-day game, and another three deliveries later, to leave India 61 for five? Or was the magic lever lifted in England’s own innings, when a ball from Jhulan Goswami beat the bottom of Nat Sciver’s bat and clunked into the stumps without, miraculously, breaking the wicket? England were 12 for two at that point, chasing 135, both women at the crease yet to score. If the bails had fallen, and England’s batting had tumbled in turn (as has happened so frequently this winter), their World Cup would have been over in record-short time. Four games, four losses: thanks for coming, don’t forget to sanitise your hands on the flight home. Instead Sciver put on 65 runs with Heather Knight, England beat India, and one of the most dramatic comebacks in cricketing history had begun. No team, male or female, have won a World Cup after losing all three of their opening games, but on Sunday, Knight’s women have that chance. Let’s rewind, gently unspool the tangled tape of this unlikely narrative. The reigning champions came into this tournament on the back of an Ashes defeat that included spirit-sapping losses in all three ODIs. Their opening performance wasn’t, however, without merit: against fellow finalists Australia, they got within 12 runs of 311, and compiled the second-highest chasing score in any women’s ODI. It took a sensational caught and bowled from Jess Jonassen to bring down Sciver and Katherine Brunt’s dash for the line. Defeat by West Indies finished in a similar tail-end scrap, but was far less impressive: England might have been chasing a far more modest total than 226 if they hadn’t squandered six relatively simple chances in the field. And when they missed another three catches (plus a missed stumping) off South Africa they quite literally let go of the reins. Seventh out of eight in the group stage table, they had ceded control over their own destiny in the tournament; even if they won all their remaining games, only the flukery of other results could secure them a route to the semi-finals. Lisa Keightley looked like a woman quietly drafting her resignation speech. How to explain what happened next? It’s inevitable that our minds turn to some of the most famous turnarounds in the men’s World Cup, be it Pakistan’s cornered tigers of ’92 or Australia’s late charge in 1999. England’s own staggering campaign in 2019 provides the most recent template, of course, and it could be that watching Eoin Morgan’s men gave England the belief, here, that what they were attempting – finessing four must-win games – was possible. One day, perhaps, we will hear apocryphal tales of the team meeting that cleared the air and lit the fire, such as Australia’s famous Pizza Hut session in ’99, or Ben Stokes rallying the troops after their third group-stage defeat, at Lord’s. For now, England’s climb-back remains an organic and unshowy one, born of Knight’s keep-calm-and-carry-on leadership and a generous glug of good luck. Their continual fortune with the coin toss, for instance, meant they could choose to field first and push for the quick chases that would improve their net run rate. But the every-game-a-final approach has made for some enduring moments already. Possibly the most memorable was the unbearable tension as England nearly went out of the tournament for a second time against New Zealand, Fran Mackay running through England’s lower order just as they seemed to be coasting to victory. It was impossible to watch Brunt’s bat sliding hopelessly short of the crease after her full body dive without noting the visual echoes of Martin Guptill run out by Jason Roy at Lord’s. There has been the relief of seeing Brunt return to form against Pakistan, and the joy of Danni Wyatt’s sudden blooming at the top of the order, like the wilting petunia that just needed moving to the right part of the garden. Even more pleasurable has been the sight of Sophie Ecclestone’s scything spin, clearing England’s passage to the final and culminating in that semi-final haul of six for 36. Knight believes all this triumph over adversity has honed the perfect knockout mentality for a World Cup final; in truth, that peak performance against South Africa on Thursday carries the echo of England’s barnstorming semi against New Zealand in the 2019 Rugby World Cup, and it’s more probable than possible that Australia will prove too much. But it’s been a compelling journey – part seesaw, part catapult – and those who were carried along will always be grateful for the ride.",Sport/Sport,England’s Women’s World Cup thrill ride has combined luck and judgment | Emma John,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/01/england-womens-cricket-world-cup-thrill-ride-australia-final
4/2/2022,"Naturally, the lasers lent the scene a certain pathos. As Mohamed Salah stepped up to take Egypt’s first penalty against Senegal on Tuesday night, the swarm of green laser beams dancing across his face were a reminder of football’s capacity to render even its greats temporarily powerless. Here was one of the biggest stars in the world’s biggest sport. But he couldn’t make his team win. He couldn’t get his country to a World Cup. And now he didn’t even have the use of his own eyes. “I was luckier,” Sadio Mané said afterwards. This was his second consecutive triumph over his Liverpool teammate, Senegal’s two-leg World Cup playoff victory coming after the Africa Cup of Nations final in February. And yet for all the advance billing of the encounter as “Mané v Salah”, there was perhaps a wider lesson from the Senegal v Egypt trilogy, one with a particular and pressing relevance to the club they both play for. Watching Mané and Salah across these three games offered a subtle but telling contrast. Though the playoff and the Afcon final were ultimately settled on penalties, Senegal mostly dominated in terms of chances and possession. Besides Mané they had the ever-present threat of Watford’s Ismaïla Sarr on the opposite flank, Boulaye Dia of Villarreal through the centre, a defence marshalled by the inspirational Kalidou Koulibaly. They had a system and a style, different approaches, different ways of playing. Egypt, by contrast, had very little. Their main striker Omar Marmoush has a Bundesliga record of three goals in 23 games. The midfield may as well have been constructed of barbed wire: not so much a device for using the ball as for deterring it somewhere else. And so pretty much everything Egypt did went through their captain: a man upon whom they have developed a touching if faintly surreal dependence. Since his debut against Sierra Leone in September 2011, Egypt have scored 191 goals, of which Salah has scored or assisted 72 (38%). And of course none of this takes into account the goals Egypt scored when Salah wasn’t even playing, after he had been substituted, the goals he helped create, goals that might have been prevented by an opposition defence that wasn’t so perturbed by the threat of Salah that they were marking him with three men. So yes, Mané was luckier than Salah: not just in the lottery of penalties but in the lottery of birth, lucky to be surrounded by a golden generation of Senegalese players, players who can pick up the slack, players who can maintain the standard when he is injured or unavailable, players who score when he doesn’t. Tellingly, Mané’s scoring rate at international level is lower than at club level. For Salah it is the opposite, and perhaps this is an opportune moment to point out that his two most prolific goalscoring seasons for Liverpool were also the two seasons when they won nothing. The point is that trying to define individual worth in a team game is a fraught and imprecise business. This feels particularly relevant at the present moment, as Mané and Salah approach the final year of their Liverpool contracts and all the relevant parties try to assess a fair market value for their services. Clearly there are lots of moving parts here: the players themselves, their age and form, a Liverpool balance sheet still laden with Covid and pre-Covid debt, the price of loyalty and memory. There has been a lot of nonsense talked about this on both sides. On one hand, the idea that Salah and Mané are somehow holding Liverpool Football Club to ransom (and somehow the full name must always be used here), that Luis Díaz and Diogo Jota will get the goals, that two of the greatest players in the club’s history must therefore be sacrificed to preserve a sacrosanct financial model whose primary objective is to generate revenue for the club’s American ownership. On the other hand, you have the idea that these are generational talents who simply want their due. Which you calculate … how, exactly? By what the next petro-state or doofus-billionaire is prepared to pay their star asset? By the internal economics of a sport whose internal economics have been corrupted beyond repair? What is the going rate for a human being in 2022? And really, both these arguments are underpinned by the ugly fallacy that talent is no more than a resource, a part that can simply be bolted on and bolted off and reattached somewhere else. Greatness needs greatness. The market worth of Salah is built not just on his own formidable talent and hard work, but that of Mané and Roberto Firmino and Jürgen Klopp and Virgil van Dijk, of the medical staff who look after him and the fans who give him strength. Take Mané out of Liverpool and stitch him into the Paris Saint-Germain team and he would be a different player entirely. Liverpool’s immense strength is not simply Mané plus Salah but Mané times Salah, each to the power of each. Never was this more apparent than in the reverse fixture against Saturday’s opponents Watford, a 5-0 win in which Mané and Salah seemed to be operating on some astral plane, finishing each other’s sentences, communicating in a tongue only they knew. And if their contrasting international travails taught us anything, it is that whatever they have achieved apart, nothing sounds as sweet as the music they have made together.",Sport/Football,How can we define what Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané are worth? | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/01/liverpool-mohamed-salah-sadio-mane
4/2/2022,"The costs of the federal government’s commitment to fund dams in Queensland without the scrutiny of a now-abolished national advisory body should be a cause for concern for the community, a former supreme court judge says. Deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce disbanded the National Water Grid Advisory Body this week, claiming it was “an appropriate time for it to conclude its work”. The body had been established by Joyce’s predecessor, Michael McCormack, in 2020 to scrutinise and provide advice on major water infrastructure projects. But former New South Wales supreme court judge Anthony Whealy QC from the Centre of Public Integrity said it’s unlikely the body has done its job two years after its establishment, and with several major projects unexamined. “The budget announcements and the uncertainty over these projects should be a cause for concern in the community,” said Whealy. “And against that background, of course, we wonder why the national water advisory board has suddenly been disbanded?” “It seems to be quite unwise … On the face of it, it looks a poor decision.” A spokesperson for Joyce has said the body “was never intended to be ongoing” and it had “met the objectives set for it when it was established in August 2020”. The termination of the national advisory body comes amid a huge cost blowout for Emu Swamp dam, with the federal government announcing another $126.5m for the project, taking their investment to $166.5m. The 12,000 megalitre dam on the Severn River was initially slated to cost $84m, with funding provided by the federal government ($47m), Queensland government ($13.6m) and local irrigators ($23.4m). Irrigator Granite Belt Water Ltd told Guardian Australia last week it had grave concerns about the viability of the project and that governments would need to triple their spend for the dam to proceed.

Guardian Australia also revealed last month that the National Water Grid Advisory Body – established by Joyce’s predecessor, Michael McCormack – was not consulted before the announcement of $5.9bn in funding to build the Urannah and Hells Gates dams in north Queensland. The proponent for the Urannah project last week said it had recently completed a detailed business case, although the Guardian understands it had not been seen by the advisory board. A detailed business case for the Hells Gates Dam, north-west of Townsville, is still in development. Townsville Enterprise, the proponent, says on its website that the document will be ready in April. The Queensland Conservation Council has written to Unesco about the two dams on the last day of its monitoring mission, which will assess whether the Reef should be listed as “in danger”. “The delegates’ mission coincided with the fourth major bleaching event in six years,” climate campaigner Maggie Mckeown said. “Within the delegates’ 10-day visit, Joyce announced almost $6bn to build two new mega dams in vulnerable reef catchments and Morrison’s budget made significant cuts to climate action measures.” Mckeown, said the projects would increase agricultural runoff, sediment and turbidity and supply water resources to new coal mines, increasing carbon emissions. “The future of the Reef depends on the decisions that our government makes today. Unesco must see that Morrison is willing to fund Reef-wrecking projects for the benefit of fossil fuel companies.”",News/Australia news,Abolition of advisory body criticised after Morrison government promises $5.9bn for Queensland dams,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/02/abolition-of-advisory-body-criticised-after-morrison-government-promises-59bn-for-queensland-dams
4/2/2022,"Matt Bekier, the chief executive of casino group Star Entertainment Group, was not happy. It was late May 2018 and he was, according to testimony to an inquiry now underway in New South Wales, the last person to enter the room for an important meeting of the company’s audit committee, which oversees the accuracy of its financial records. There was “heightened tension in the room”, Star’s former chief risk officer, Paul McWilliams, told the inquiry, which is being held by the state’s Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority. The cause of Bekier’s unhappiness, McWilliams said, was the document he, the company’s directors and key executives were there to discuss: a report prepared by KPMG which outlined alleged failings in the anti-money laundering programs Star was supposed to have in place to keep dirty money out of its casinos in Sydney, Brisbane and the Gold Coast. Bekier made “a show of throwing on to the table what I assumed to be this report – or the extract – the executive summary of this report and saying, ‘I haven’t seen this’,” McWilliams told the inquiry. “And then the discussion was along the lines of, as best I can recall, that it was unacceptable for the report to be prepared in this way, that it was wrong in some respects – material respects, but without getting into a lot of detail as to what was wrong.” McWilliams said he agreed with the report and the inquiry heard that KPMG stood by it. Bekier resigned from his $3m a year job on Monday after the inquiry heard evidence regarding his alleged hostility towards KPMG’s report. Star said that, while the review remains ongoing, Bekier told the company’s board he was “accountable for the effectiveness and adequacy of the company’s processes, policies, people and culture” and the right thing for him to do was take responsibility. The inquiry had previously heard evidence of other alleged failings by the company, including a scheme where Star allowed gamblers to disguise $900m gambled across its tables as hotel expenses and allowed a junket operator to run a room where large amounts of cash were exchanged in paper bags. However, his resignation is not enough to satisfy critics of Star and of casino regulation, who see the current hearings repeating the same types of allegations aired against its bigger rival, Crown, at three previous inquiries and say the problems that have been exposed are symptoms of a deeper malaise afflicting corporate Australia. “What it comes down to is the clear lack at a political level of regulation of these businesses and ensuring the regulators have sufficient resources and sufficient capacity to enforce any level of regulation,” says Charles Livingstone, a gambling policy expert and associate professor in the school of public health and preventive medicine at Monash University. “That’s dependent on a range of factors including their influence – Star perhaps less so than Crown and the Packers, but they’re all pretty well connected in government and able to get what they want. “The message is loud and clear that the casinos are not to be troubled, not to be touched.” It is not clear whether the allegations emerging about Star and the findings about Crown and Star will yet lead politicians to rethink their attitude towards casinos. The inquiries found that Crown facilitated money laundering through its Melbourne and Sydney casinos and that some junket operators who brought in high-rolling gamblers from overseas were linked to organised crime. They also criticised Crown’s former directors for failing to properly oversee the gambling empire’s operations. But this week, NSW’s cities minister, Rob Stokes, said it might be “time for our community to rise up against them”. In a statement to state parliament this week, he said: “Now is the best time to ask the question: are the illusory and ephemeral benefits of Sydney’s casinos worth the proven harm – the deceit, the crime, the destroyed lives?” Casinos have two big business areas – what they call “grind”, the flow of every day folk through the public gaming floor, where Livingstone estimates half the money comes from people with a gambling problem – and high-rollers and junkets. In the inquiries so far into casinos in Australia – the Bergin inquiry in NSW and royal commissions in Victoria and Western Australia – most of the focus has been on the high-rollers. Only the Victorian inquiry, run by former federal court judge Ray Finkelstein, spent significant time examining the damage done to gambling addicts lured into the casino floor by the carefully calibrated lights and sounds of their serried ranks of poker machines. The Star inquiry has, so far, also focused on high-rollers. It got off to a spectacular start last month, hearing evidence the casino disguised $900m gambled through it as accommodation spending by allowing users of China UnionPay to deposit money at the group’s hotels that was then transferred to their gambling account. And it has also seen video of large amounts of cash exchanging hands at “Salon 95”, a private gaming room run by junket operator Suncity, whose principal, Alvin Chau, was arrested in Macau in November last year on charges of operating gambling activities in mainland China. It was only after Chau’s arrest that Star cut off relations with Suncity, the inquiry heard this week. High rollers have also landed Crown in regulatory trouble. Australia’s financial intelligence agency, Austrac, launched legal action against Crown in February, accusing it of 547 breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism finance laws – breaches that, if proven in court, are likely to cost Crown hundreds of millions of dollars in fines. “We’re not talking about the odd postage stamp being nicked from the mailroom. We’ve got guys turning up in jeans and T-shirts with cooler bags full of cash,” Livingstone says of the allegations. Andrew Linden, a corporate governance expert at RMIT University, says a decision by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission last month not to pursue allegations that 10 unnamed former Crown executives and directors breached their duties points to a broader problem with corporate regulation. Defending the decision, ASIC said that the directors were reasonably entitled to “rely on what they were being told by senior management”. He points out that Australia lacks equivalent laws to Germany, where directors can be held criminally responsible and jailed for misdeeds committed by the companies they run. “All these grand pooh-bahs of the corporate governance world run around saying Australia has a rolled gold corporate governance regime, it is at the bleeding edge,” he says. “But all the offences are against the corporate entity, not against the directors.” Linden says the Bergin inquiry into Crown in NSW, as well as the inquiries into the company in Victoria and WA, showed a pattern of directors failing to record their deliberations. He points to findings of the Perth royal commission that Crown’s former directors did not record the full activities of the board in the minutes of its meetings. “It’s the same pattern of all care and no responsibility,” he says. “At a fundamental level it reveals that the whole approach to corporate governance in this country is in a bad place.” The inquiry continues.",News/Australia news,Star wars: how the NSW casino inquiry claimed a CEO ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/01/star-wars-how-the-nsw-casino-inquiry-claimed-a-ceo
4/2/2022,"Two of the Bureau of Meteorology’s highest-resolution forecasting models showed the dangerous storm that flooded Lismore this week returning to the area, at the same time as relieved residents were heading home after an evacuation order was lifted. When the acting New South Wales premier, Paul Toole, addressed media on Wednesday, after Lismore’s CBD was evacuated for the second time in 24 hours, he said “no one could have predicted some of the amounts of rainfall that we have seen land”. But two of the BoM’s most sophisticated simulation models showed the storm front, which some forecasts predicted would head out to sea, instead returning inland. Weather forecasting is an inexact science and all meteorologists rely on multiple models as part of their work, but multiple independent sources have questioned why Lismore CBD residents were being told it was safe to be at home on Tuesday evening. At 5.35pm on Tuesday, based on BoM advice, the State Emergency Service issued an “all clear”, cancelling a previously issued evacuation order for areas including the Lismore CBD and Lismore basin and telling residents they could “return safely with caution”. But shortly before 1am on Wednesday, after heavy rain, the BoM’s advice for Lismore was again upgraded to a major flood warning, and an evacuation alert was reinstated by the SES at 3am. Mark Hardy, a meteorologist and the founder of Weatherzone, said that modelling early on Tuesday evening suggested the northern rivers region of NSW was likely not yet out of the woods. “A few of the models were having the low [pressure system] spinning away off to the coast and down to the south,” Hardy said. But two high-resolution BoM models that cover northern NSW – the Brisbane and Sydney Access-C models – “were both indicating the low was going to suck back towards the coast and intensify rapidly”, he said. “When they saw that model that afternoon … that should have been alarming.” Weatherzone is a private company that pays for access to the same forecasting models as the BoM. At any given point a meteorologist may be consulting “half a dozen different weather models, running all at different times at different resolutions”, Hardy said. But the Access-C models were of very high resolution and were the BoM’s “fastest-running models”, he added. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Thomas Hinterdorfer, an extreme weather chaser who works for Higgins Storm Chasing, confirmed that the Access-C modelling on Tuesday showed heavy rain was expected to fall across parts of the northern rivers overnight. “Model data was indicating between 200 and 400mm in the 12 hours … from 7pm,” Hinterdorfer said. “It was a very concerning forecast to be looking at.” Flood waters ultimately peaked in Lismore at 11.4 metres, well above the levee height of 10.6 metres, and the city’s fifth highest flood on record. A spokesperson for the NSW SES said the first evacuation order on Tuesday was cancelled when the “the river level did not reach the forecast heights and began to fall, meaning that risk was no longer present”. “There was exceptional new rainfall that subsequently fell that night that was not forecast. This resulted in flash flooding and the Wilsons River to rise once again. There was a need to reissue the evacuation warning and subsequent evacuation order to warn the community.” The Lismore state Labor MP, Janelle Saffin, whose property was flooded four weeks ago, said: “We got told, ‘Evacuation off, safe to return’.” “The key issue is it was wrong. We just didn’t get timely warnings. “The modelling [indicating heavy rain] – I know it was there. Someone alerted me to it,” she said. “That was why I then raised it at the highest level.” In a statement, the BoM declined to answer questions about specific advice provided on Tuesday, saying it had forecast the risk of heavy rainfall for northern NSW “many days in advance, with flood watches and warnings also issued days in advance”. “Severe weather warnings have been in place since Saturday for northern NSW, including for Byron Bay and Lismore, including the potential for life threatening and dangerous flash flooding,” it said.

On Tuesday night, “the inability of the state to respond appropriately, reasonably and safely were exposed”, Higginson said. “We need to understand that our systems are not able, right now in their current form, to safely navigate what we’re facing. And that’s the first stage of response. We need to acknowledge that the state is failing in its capacities to keep its community safe.” At Wednesday’s press conference, the BoM meteorologist Dean Narramore said it was getting harder to predict flooding events and that work was being done to improve modelling. “We’re moving into high-resolution modelling, that is a much finer scale so it can pick up these convective elements,” he said. Most independent and government weather organisations rely on publicly available models coordinated by the World Meteorological Organization, a UN agency. “The government weather models are pretty much best of breed around the world these days,” Hardy said. “It’s the way you use them, of course, that’s quite critical.”",News/Australia news,High-resolution BoM models showed Lismore was in danger while evacuation order was lifted,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/02/high-resolution-bom-models-showed-lismore-was-in-danger-while-evacuation-order-was-lifted
4/2/2022,"Liberal senator and assistant minister Amanda Stoker charged taxpayers $2,600 for “personal travel” with her family through the Whitsunday region in the weeks before Christmas 2020, documents seen by Guardian Australia show. The freedom of information documents reveal Stoker took a four-day trip with her family in December 2020, charging taxpayers for flights and the use of a hire car. Expenses watchdog the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority (Ipea) began probing the trip in July last year following a routine check of MP claims for family travel and trips around “desirable locations”. Stoker flew with her three children from Brisbane to Townsville on 12 December, hiring a car and staying the night. The assistant minister had legitimate parliamentary business in Townsville, Cape Cleveland and Ayr on the first two days of the trip, including meeting with a state MP and local residents, small businesses and graziers, and a visit to the Australia Institute of Marine Science. But the senator and her family then continued travelling through the Whitsunday region, staying in Gumlu and Bowen, before travelling to Proserpine. Stoker billed taxpayers for the ongoing costs of the hire car as they travelled through the Whitsunday region, and for return flights from Proserpine to Brisbane on 15 December. The rules state that claims for the travel expenses of family, referred to as “family reunion travel”, must only be made where a politician is travelling chiefly for parliamentary business and their family is travelling to accompany or join them. The relatives’ travel must principally be to help facilitate family life. Ipea wrote to Stoker in August 2021 seeking an explanation of her travel through the Whitsundays. The senator responded with evidence showing the first two days of the trip had involved parliamentary business. But she conceded the remainder of the trip was “personal” in nature. “The senator confirmed travel from 13 December to 15 December 2020 was personal travel,” Ipea’s internal report said. “The senator asked to be invoiced for the cost of the hire car and returning flights.” The watchdog billed Stoker $2,620 for the claims, which included return flights and car hire costs, and added a 25% penalty. Stoker paid the invoice almost two months later in October. No further action was taken. Stoker’s office told the Guardian it would be wrong to suggest the trip was a “holiday” or that she had visited the Whitsundays themselves. “Following the conclusion of her parliamentary business, Senator Stoker drove to Bowen and then Proserpine airport for her return flight to Brisbane. She did not visit the Whitsundays,” a spokesperson said. “The dominant purpose of travel was parliamentary business – Senator Stoker worked on all four days and it is inaccurate to claim this was a holiday. The senator did not claim travel allowance for the 13 and 14 of December as this portion of the trip involved some aspect of personal travel.” Earlier this week, Ipea released a separate audit of the travel of Liberal MP Andrew Laming, who claimed expenses for family reunion travel involving his wife. The audit, launched following reporting in the Guardian, found Laming had wrongly billed taxpayers more than $8,000 and at times “obfuscated, provided inconsistent answers or ignored [questions]” during its investigation. The audit examined Laming’s travel in a single month and found he had wrongly claimed 21 expenses – all relating to his or his family’s travel between Hobart, Melbourne and Brisbane in June 2019 – totalling $8,288.04 and told him to pay back $10,360, including a 25% loading. Laming has strongly refuted the report, saying he disputed “every syllable” and describing the investigation as a “witch-hunt”. “Ipea’s finding that the travel was not ‘parliamentary enough’ is false,” he said. “For this reason I categorically reject the report’s conclusions and view the process as a ‘witch-hunt’. “I won’t be repaying legitimate parliamentary travel, and no MP ever should.” Ipea said it gives MPs 30 days to pay back wrongly claimed expenses. A spokesperson said Ipea then “actively pursues amounts owing to it in accordance with our obligations”.",News/Australia news,"Liberal Amanda Stoker repays taxpayers $2,600 for travel with family through Whitsunday region",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/02/liberal-amanda-stoker-repays-taxpayers-2600-for-travel-with-family-through-whitsunday-region
4/2/2022,"The rainforest country of the northern rivers has long been a heartland of alternative thinking and lifestyles. But residents of Lismore say that when putrid flood waters inundated their homes and destroyed their businesses for the second time in a matter of weeks, it shattered any vestige of the idea of “normal” they had set for themselves, sending them adrift into what feels like a parallel universe. As the water – thick with oil and sewage – recedes once again, it leaves behind a carpet of filth and detritus. Trauma, too, runs thick. The litter will be removed and streets cleaned, but many people fear that trauma will never fully heal. When water overtopped the Wilsons River levee on Wednesday morning, Ella Buckland, her eight-year-old daughter Myla and partner Joshua Howard were sheltering at her mother’s house on a hill in Lismore. The young family lost their home when the New South Wales town flooded on 28 February. They had been staying with Buckland’s mother since. Others are in the same predicament – couch surfing and crashing with friends and relatives weeks later. In Lismore, they’re known as “flood refugees”. Buckland says her family are “riding a very strange wave of emotions”. When the water receded after the first flood, there was trauma and exhaustion. But once Buckland and Howard managed to wrap their heads around their situation, they began tearing down walls, applying for insurance and rebuilding. Then the water returned. “We had a terrible couple of days over this last flood,” Buckland says. “Just complete desperation and loss of all hope – for us and for the town.” Buckland is not alone in her despair. East Ballina psychologist Jane Enter, who practises in Bryon Bay, says she is dealing with widespread trauma across the region.“There’s a lot of existential angst: ‘Are we going to survive? Is it going to be OK? They have never experienced this kind of weather for this long,” Enter says. “You’ve gotta remember that there was flood in 2017, fires in 2019 and then Covid. “People are punch drunk.” Some are busy getting drunk, or at least heading in that direction. For many left without homes and work again, there doesn’t seem much else to do. Matthew Stanley lives with his girlfriend Tyla Moore and her mother in a rental house on a hill in the Lismore suburb of Goonellabah. Though their home stayed dry, all three were left with no income because they were cut off from their casual jobs when their workplaces went underwater. Stanley works for a hire car company in Ballina. Moore and her mother work as cleaners. She recently landed a job in the Lismore Square shopping centre, scrubbing mould which covered its walls after the last flood. Stanley is keeping positive. On Thursday he waded through chest-high water to retrieve some possessions from the Gollan Hotel, where he and Moore had been living until earlier this year. His rescued possessions mainly consisted of his “mad little esky” and an assortment of sours and pale ales. The beers aren’t just for Stanley and Moore. Friends – a young family with children – had been crashing in their lounge room since their house flooded in February. This week, their home flooded again. “They don’t know how to think any more,” Stanley says. “I don’t know how they’re gonna bounce back. I keep telling him to go get a job, go to Brisbane … but that means relocating his family.’ Matt Lewis and Steve Miller are also on the beers on Thursday as they clean their neighbouring homes. For Miller, it is the same house he grew up in and one that last flooded when he was three-and-a-half-years old, back in 1974. He has vague memories of that disaster – but Miller will never forget the flood of 28 February 2022. In the early hours of that morning, water rushed through his home, eventually coming to within centimetres of his roof. As it rose through the second floor, Miller donned a lifejacket and was about to swim for higher ground. Then he heard the screams of his elderly neighbour. “I swam from my front steps to her house,” Miller says. “She was standing on a chair in her kitchen as the water was rising. “I said: ‘Bev, we gotta go.” He told Bev to hold on to his jacket and the pair threw themselves into the flood water. The first rays of light had broken through and a friend in a tinnie saw them struggling in the water. Miller went from rescuer to being rescued. “If it hadn’t have been in daylight, we would have fuckin’ drowned,” he says. Miller also wonders if he would have been able to save his neighbour in the dark, or if he would have had to have gone it alone and leave her to her fate. “What a cunt of a decision that would be to make,” he says. Miller’s not a man for expressing his emotions. “It is what it is,” he says of the floods. “What are you gonna do, sit around and cry all day?” Nevertheless, he told Bev to leave her home when the heavy rain set in this week. “I said: ‘I can’t go through that shit again’,” Miller says. The kind heroic community response to disaster that Miller describes undoubtedly saved many more lives. But former Lismore councillor and solicitor Eddie Lloyd says that narrative has been used by state and federal governments as a smokescreen for the “inadequacy” of their response. “What gets lost in this wave of celebration of the community response is the trauma,” she says. “It’s the people in the boats that are hearing people screaming out of their fuckin’ rooftops – it’s friends helping friends in life and death situation.” Lloyd says she has “no doubt that every single person” who went through these situations is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. “We need trauma counselling for climate change,” she says. Instead, Lloyd feels as if she is on the frontline of a climate crisis that is being denied by the words and actions of the Australian government. “I feel like I’m a victim of domestic violence with this government that continues to gaslight me, questioning my reality,” she says. “It makes us feel like we’re in a parallel universe.” Lloyd says she is not alarmist, but she is now very alarmed. Her gravest fears, though, are for her eight-year-old son Ryder. “He has Asperger’s and ADHD,” she says. “He can’t really accommodate much change in his brain.” But change has been thrust upon Ryder. His school may not reopen for another year. Buckland too fears most for daughter Myla and her mental health. In “a great achievement” for Myla’s wellbeing, Buckland made the call to evacuate her house on the night of 27 February and so managed to avoid a near-death experience. But when Myla re-entered the classroom, she was exposed to the harrowing accounts of her peers, many of whom had been plucked from flood water and had also lost their homes. All of which has left Buckland and Howard in limbo. Do they repair their home or sell it for however much they can get and leave town? “The question I keep asking myself is: do I want my child to grow up in a town that’s completely broken by flooding?” Buckland says. It’s a huge decision to make, Buckland says, and one that could make her uproot her elderly mother and daughter and leave their support networks and friends behind. All she knows for now is that, whatever decision she makes, there will be no return to life as it was. “After the first flood I just kept thinking: I want it all to go back to normal,” Buckland says. “Now I am like: what is normal? How many years ago was normal? “The new normal is not knowing what is coming and accepting that everything is impermanent. “That’s the new normal.”",News/Australia news,Adrift in a parallel universe: Lismore struggles to find itself after another flood,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/02/adrift-in-a-parallel-universe-lismore-struggles-to-find-itself-after-another-flood
4/2/2022,"Australia’s parliament teems with people, so the place can sometimes feel like a living, breathing, organism. As Australia’s 46th parliament ground through its final week, at the tail end of three punishing years of fire, flood and plague, it was like the organism felt pain. The week began with public expressions of mourning. Colleagues shared tributes to the late Labor senator Kimberley Kitching. The foreign minister, Marise Payne, one of the most buttoned up operators in contemporary politics, crumpled and wept. Fellow stoic the shadow foreign minister, Penny Wong, offered Payne tissues. While some of Kitching’s colleagues and intimates grieved, others, cast as cartoon villains in a febrile media-fuelled melodrama, reached for grace. Typically, Labor’s deputy Senate leader, Kristina Keneally, modelled grace with a sting, noting “those who use the grief caused by [Kitching’s] death for purposes other than honouring her life and her work will find no friend in me”. Just as the sad and strange cycle of Kitching began to ebb – a new front opened. The Liberal senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells – recently relegated to an unwinnable spot on the Liberal party’s New South Wales Senate ticket – opened a wound on the government side. On Monday, during her emotionally charged farewell to Kitching, which became (like many others) a homily against factional excesses, the Liberal right-winger slammed the quiescent “sisterhood” of the Liberal party. Then on budget night she declared Scott Morrison was an “autocrat [and] a bully who has no moral compass”. Fierravanti-Wells said Morrison topped the list of “ruthless” people she’d met in politics. “Morrison is not interested in rules-based order,” she said. “It is his way or the highway.” Morrison is now reasonably practised in the art of rapid j’accuse response, having been called a liar by Emmanuel Macron, a hypocrite and a liar by Barnaby Joyce, a horrible horrible person (allegedly) by Gladys Berejiklian, (reportedly) “an absolute arsehole” by former ministerial colleague Michael Keenan, (allegedly) a complete psycho and a “fraud” by an unnamed cabinet colleague, and “menacing controlling wallpaper” by the former Liberal MP Julia Banks. As might have been predicted, the prime minister responded to his latest negative character assessment by going on the offensive. He said words to the effect of hell hath no fury like a woman scorned by 500-or-so Liberal preselectors. The Victorian Liberal senator Jane Hume smiled benignly as she twisted the knife further, noting of Fierravanti-Wells it was “very confronting” when “hundreds of people are telling you you’re not the one they want this time around”. All very uplifting stuff. I suspect none of the many backroom operators prowling the parliamentary precinct ever thought to war-game the likelihood of the final days of the 46th parliament furnishing a sound stage for a public seminar on the derangements of major party factionalism, mean girls and bullyboys. But there it was. A rhetorical war zone, with wounds being inflicted and dressed without anaesthetic in full public view. Given politics had become a rolling maul, the animus spilled over into the courts. Between the mourning and the score settling, Morrison and the New South Wales premier failed to persuade the high court to rule on their power to handpick candidates for the federal election. The high court also declined to hear challenges to the federal intervention into the Victorian branch of the ALP. Between the squalls, pre-election parliamentary business happened. Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg delivered their fistfull-of-dollars budget, and Anthony Albanese a reply. The intraday bitch-slapping and bathos was also punctured by the gravitas of the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The president managed to electrify the House of Representatives via video link from his war bunker half a world away, being a serious person, navigating the zone between life and death, democracy and autocracy, freedom and tyranny. The last week of parliament always indulges farewells. George Christensen tried to jag one more vacuous headline by railing in his valedictory against net zero, “woke” corporations and “globalist” elites. Kevin Andrews, in public life since 1991, had finally been cut down by the Liberal preselectors. His wife, Margaret, cried in the visitor’s gallery as he delivered his final remarks. Then there was Tony Smith. Smith spent much of the current parliament as Speaker of the House of Representatives. I’ve known him since I arrived in the parliamentary press gallery in 1996. In those days, he worked for Peter Costello, trailing in his wake as media adviser. Back then, as a term of endearment, some of us dubbed Smith “the pooper scooper” – an extrapolation of a caustic observation about his boss that I believe was levelled by either Jeff Kennett or Andrew Peacock. (If this anecdote is unfamiliar, it was alleged that Costello had “all the attributes of a dog, except loyalty”.) Smith was earnest in our shared youth, conducting his business with a quaint sort of formality; a serious person cursed to occupy politics in unserious times. In his valedictory on Thursday, he noted he’d come to politics and parliament in “the reform era”. The unflattering comparison with the low-stakes vaudeville of the present was implicit rather than stated. During Smith’s young adulthood, Paul Keating overhauled the tax system. Costello did it again during the 1990s. Smith confessed it was hard work in Costello’s ministerial engine room. Securing various reforms “took a long time”. There were lots of ups and downs. “It was never popular, but it was achieved against the odds.” Very little has been heard over the past three years about Australia’s economic reform project. It lingers in the talking points, but it’s near-absent in reality, because so much of contemporary political conflict orbits around personalities and power rather than the battle of ideas. Sounding decidedly retro, Smith mused that government needed to be about something. “Reforms that deliver greater efficiency, higher productivity and budget improvements will need to occur over the next decade,” he said. “The composition and priority are for future parliaments to consider.” There was a warning. “Those who might be tempted to think nothing is required in the future years and in the next decade would be mistaken to think a decision to simply do nothing is costless. In fact, a decision to do nothing is an active decision to see things deteriorate and to consign future generations to an Australia with fewer opportunities.” The 30th Speaker of the House of Representatives also reflected on the state of democracy. He suggested parliamentarians possessed one simple antidote for disaffection. They could engage in a robust battle of ideas, while keeping things civil. Given entrenched disaffection with the major parties was fuelling the rise of independents and micro party actors, Smith advised his colleagues to look at the root causes. Because the major parties had “been vital in giving stability and certainty in the formation and the conduct of government in our parliamentary democracy” they needed to grapple with why the combined primary vote share of the major parties had gone from 95% in 1975 to a little under 75% at the last federal election. “I don’t say this out of any disrespect at all to the crossbench, who need to be congratulated for overcoming enormous obstacles to get elected,” Smith said. “I simply make the point that I don’t believe, if there were 151 independents in this house, we would have stable, predictable or workable government”. Albanese had the last word in the 46th parliament by delivering his budget reply speech on Thursday night. After the adjournment, the House cleared in a rush, but there were a few laggards. One was the former Nationals leader Michael McCormack, who was blasted out of the deputy prime ministership by Barnaby Joyce. McCormack made a point of grabbing a quiet moment with Albanese to shake his hand and exchange pleasantries. Greg Hunt, the Liberal health minister, who is also retiring at this election, lingered. The shadow health minister, Mark Butler, crossed the chamber to shake his hand. Smith wandered over and when Butler made to leave, the two Victorian Liberals who began their careers as political staffers before entering the arena themselves sat together for a few minutes on the government bench. As the attendants moved about clearing the chamber, Hunt and Smith made their way up to the exit. Smith turned back, just for a minute. He allowed himself one last glance across the chamber he’d either sat in, or served, for the best part of three decades, before striding out into the night. In the 46th parliament, Smith was the last man out of the House. The Hansard records Smith’s final contribution. “I stood right here, on this spot, on the floor of this great House of Representatives, at the dawn of the 40th parliament and said hello.” “As the sun sets on this 46th parliament, I say thank you. Good luck. Goodbye”.",News/Australia news,Hell hath no fury like the last days of Australia’s 46th parliament | Katharine Murphy,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/02/hell-hath-no-fury-like-the-last-days-of-australias-46th-parliament
4/2/2022,"On one side of Sunday’s upcoming World Cup final is the inevitable. In 50-over cricket, the Australians march on like Darth Vader: more machine now than human, twisted and evil. You could argue that’s overstated, but they do have an imposing relentlessness. After having their world record winning streak of 26 matches broken back in September, Australia immediately set about building the next one. It currently sits at 11, including an unblemished eight wins through this cup campaign. Their semi-final against West Indies was a thrashing. On the other side of the coin is the unlikely. A few months ago the defending champions were expected to challenge for this prize, but England wobbled through the Ashes like a one-wheeled tricycle, lost their first three World Cup games, then stumbled backwards into two of the wins they needed to make the top four. Their semi-final was against South Africa, a team running hot whose only loss in the tournament was a competitive one against Australia. But when the South Africans dropped Danni Wyatt five times, England’s opener had almost no choice but to make a match-winning century. However debatable their merit, and however poor their recent years against Australia, England are in the final. The beauty for an underdog is that it only takes one anomaly to take the prize. A core of players have experienced the occasion before. Now that Wyatt has replaced the underperforming Lauren Winfield-Smith, there have been runs through the tournament from most of the batters, though England persist with the delusion that wicketkeeper Amy Jones is doing the job at at five, and that seamer Katherine Brunt is a No 7. With the bowling, Brunt now operates on reputation more than reality, still talked about on commentary as a speedster when she’s more likely to use back-of-the-hand slower balls. Her new-ball partner Anya Shrubsole looks little like the player who bowled England to victory in 2017, though there were glimpses of that swing and zip in her semi-final spell. With Nat Sciver as the only bowling option in the top six, and Charlie Dean still finding her way, much relies on the class of spinner Sophie Ecclestone and the accuracy of seamer Kate Cross. But the Australians looted Ecclestone for 77 runs last time they met, and Cross for 62. Neither took a wicket. That’s the thing about Australia. If Alyssa Healy doesn’t get off to a blazing start, like the hundred in her semi-final, then Rachael Haynes will compile 80 to bed down the innings. Or Meg Lanning and Ellyse Perry will get together for that partnership that over the years still averages nearly a hundred runs a pop. Failing that, Beth Mooney comes in with the ability to play any role required, fast making the case that she is now the best batter in this team. Ash Gardner floats about waiting for her chance to launch for the fence. Tahlia McGrath is the most improved in the world in the last year and might not get a shot until No 7. In the unlikely event that Perry’s back spasms keep her out of the final, Annabel Sutherland will slot straight in, an all-rounder who bowled that nerveless spell to save the Ashes Test in Canberra in January. Gardner and McGrath both bowl. Megan Schutt still swings the ball a mile, Darcie Brown fires it down faster than anyone at the tournament, Alana King frightens players differently with leg-spin, and Jess Jonassen’s left-arm darts still have her ranked the second-best bowler in the world. These are the things that have created such a gulf between the teams as they stand. England shorten their batting lineup to squeeze in an extra bowler and still have an attack with less variety and quality than Australia, who bat down to nine. Where England quickly look short on options when one bowler is taken down, Australia can turn to another, then the next. Most of all, where England have stuttered and mis-stepped through the last few months, they have looked unsure of themselves on and off the field. The Australians have not. Where England have talked about hoping to come good, Australia have simply been good. Where England have talked about peaking at the right time, Australia have peaked every time. It has been that way from the start of this World Cup, and it will take something very special to stop it continuing right to the end.",Sport/Sport,Relentless Australia ready to prove gulf in class against England | Geoff Lemon,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/01/relentless-australia-ready-to-prove-gulf-in-class-against-england
4/2/2022,"The Australian Conservation Foundation has rejected a claim by Angus Taylor that it has backed away from criticising Australia’s carbon credit system. The environment group called for an independent review to address “significant flaws” in the scheme. Taylor, the energy and emissions reduction minister, suggested in a speech on Friday that the ACF had distanced itself from Prof Andrew Macintosh, a former advisor to the Coalition government on carbon credit integrity who has described the system as “largely a sham” that wasted funding and was not reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Macintosh, an Australian National University law professor and former head of the government’s emissions reduction assurance committee, said all the major methods approved by the government to create carbon credits had “serious integrity issues”. He estimated 75% of carbon credits issued by the Clean Energy Regulator, a government agency, may not represent real or new cuts in emissions as required. His critique, outlined in four academic papers, challenges the credibility of the Coalition’s $4.5bn “direct action” emissions reduction fund, through which the government buys carbon credits from landholders and businesses. The allegations have been dismissed by the regulator and industry body the Carbon Market Institute, which said on Friday it had found “key issues” with Macintosh’s analysis. Taylor told a Carbon Market Institute conference he believed the professor’s claims were “completely unfounded”. “It is telling that groups like the ACF have backed away from this latest round of attacks on the [emissions reduction fund] and are no longer promoting the claims that have been refuted by the regulator and [committee],” Taylor said. The ACF’s chief executive, Kelly O’Shanassy, rejected Taylor’s characterisation. She said the group believed there were “significant flaws” in the carbon offsets scheme. “We share Prof Andrew Macintosh’s concerns. Any speech given by the energy minister that claims otherwise is incorrect,” she said. Carbon credits are used by the government and polluting companies as an alternative to cutting carbon dioxide emissions. Instead of reducing their own pollution, they can choose to buy carbon credits that are meant to represent a reduction in emissions elsewhere. Each carbon credit represents one tonne of carbon dioxide that has either been stopped from going in the atmosphere, or sucked out of it. Methods approved to generate carbon credits in Australia include regenerating native forest that has been cleared, protecting a forest that would otherwise have been cleared (known as “avoided deforestation”) and capturing and using emissions that leak from landfill sites to generate electricity. Credits are bought by the government through the $4.5bn taxpayer-funded emissions reduction scheme or by polluters on the private market.  O’Shanassy said a report last year by the ACF and the Australia Institute that found many “avoided deforestation” projects – under which landholders get carbon credits for not removing vegetation from their land – were essentially “junk” was consistent with Macintosh’s research. “Our investigation revealed people and companies getting credits for not clearing forests that were never going to be cleared and for projects that were financially viable and would have gone ahead anyway,” she said. “We have raised our concerns with the Clean Energy Regulator but have been ignored and criticised, even when we have shared our methodology with the regulator beforehand. It’s time for an independent review of Australia’s carbon credit scheme.” John Connor, the chief executive of the Carbon Market Institute, has said many carbon market participants - including a “vast network of farmers, traditional owners, service providers, investors, auditors, conservationists and public servants” who had spent the past decade striving for faster emissions reductions - felt aggrieved by Macintosh’s accusations. Taylor applauded Connor’s stance. He suggested criticisms of the carbon credit system were a “political attack” and said industries had “a responsibility to stand up – not for themselves, but for the facts”. The minister said the regulator and emissions reduction assurance committee had looked into earlier claims about carbon credits lacking integrity and found they were “not supported by evidence”. “Of course, I expect the regulator and [the committee] to look into these new claims and I welcome the fact they have already commenced that important work,” Taylor said. “I look forward to the outcome of their investigations, which will be released publicly once complete.” Labor’s climate change and energy spokesman, Chris Bowen, has said carbon credits were “very important”, would be “increasingly important” under an ALP government and promised a “short and sharp” review of the carbon credit scheme if it wins the upcoming election. Macintosh’s allegations have made waves due to his central role in administering the carbon credit scheme. He has been appointed to several senior roles by the Coalition, including to serve as a royal commissioner examining Australia’s natural disaster response after the 2019-20 bushfires. He told Guardian Australia he attempted to address the problems with carbon credits while on the integrity committee but had limited success, and regretted he had not taken a stronger stance. He said he continued to try to persuade the regulator and other officials of the need to act before deciding to go public. Macintosh has called on the regulator to release data not currently in the public domain that it relied on to say the system was working, and said there should be an independent inquiry into the failures of the system with the power to compel people to give evidence.",News/Australia news,ACF rejects Angus Taylor’s claim it eased off attacking Australia’s carbon credit scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/02/acf-rejects-angus-taylors-claim-it-eased-off-attacking-australias-carbon-credit-scheme
4/2/2022,"As an amplified La Niña weather event turned life on the Australian east coast into a flooded misery over recent weeks, it has also played a role in helping bring the vast desert lake near the middle of the continent to life. Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre is about 700km north of Adelaide, covers more than 9,000 sq km – an area roughly equivalent to greater suburban Melbourne – and is the lowest point on the Australian mainland. When the tropical monsoon hits, floodwaters flow from major rivers in the channel country of outback Queensland. That last happened on a large scale in 2019, when the area was inundated for the first time in decades. Vegetation flourishes in normally dry river channels after uncommonly high local rainfall at Anna Creek Station This year the Queensland waterways have not contributed as much to filling the lake, at least to this point, though some water is still flowing down from the Diamantina River. Instead, the lake itself was hit with a dump of local rain in January more than twice the long-term average, and water has flown in from the nearby Flinders Ranges. A flock of Australian pelicans rest on a river channel that cuts through Lake Eyre North Rivers, green with vegetation, flow near the edge of Lake Eyre North It is not as wet as three years ago but, as seen from the air by photographer Doug Gimesy, the result is a spectacular dance of pinks, blues, greens and browns as the water replaces red dirt and the dry lake’s white salt pan. Pink water at the edge of the salt pan and land in the Madigan Gulf The edge of Lake Eyre North showing water (brown), salt pan and water flow patterns Prof Richard Kingsford, a conservation biologist at the University of New South Wales, has been studying the globally significant lake ecosystem for more than three decades and says there has not been rainfall like this over the lake since the 1980s. To see the filling lake in person, he says, is breathtaking. “It is absolutely amazing,” Kingsford says. “I never tire of flying over it because every time you do it, it’s different. Just the expanse of it. You get these amazing pink colours.” An aerial view of a pond reflecting the light in Lake Eyre South just after sunrise “When it’s full it’s like a mirror and you get this thing where you lose your horizon. I remember being with pilots saying they had to use their instruments [to fly] because it was the only way to navigate.” The ecosystem comes alive when there is enough fresh water to dilute the salt that rests on the dry lake floor. Then, tiny microscopic crustaceans hatch from egg cases at the bottom of the lake. That in turn brings saltwater fish and bird species – pelicans, pink-eared ducks, banded stilts and migratory waders such as the sharp-tailed sandpipers. Corellas perch in a tree near a water hole at Beresford Railway Siding A flock of corellas fly across the dusk sky “I still remember counting birds there in the 1990s and there was 300,000 birds there of every species you could imagine. It was just like clouds of these birds flying up in front of us,” Kingsford says. The transformation of the landscape this year has been welcomed by traditional owners, ecologists, graziers and tourist operators, who fly sightseeing trips across the transforming country. Estuaries and channels form as water flows at Neales Inlet from the Neale River in Lake Eyre North Vegetation flourishes in the red desert after heavy rains in the usually dry area The Lake Eyre Basin is considered one of the planet’s last remaining pristine desert river systems and is a contested space. Locals have campaigned to stop development harnessing and rediverting the flow of water. Two decades ago there was a push to expand cotton irrigation in south-western and central Queensland. Now, the big development push is from energy companies eyeing the channel country’s fossil fuel reserves. Gas is locked several kilometres down, with government reports suggesting it would need hydraulic fracturing to liberate it. Kingsford says plans to build dams are also a risk to the basin’s health. “There are always big threats,” he says. “Thankfully, it’s pretty much still a free-flowing river system.” An aerial view of water flowing over the salt pan edge into Lake Eyre South",News/Environment,‘Absolutely amazing’: Lake Eyre dances with colour thanks to unprecedented rain,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/01/absolutely-amazing-lake-eyre-dances-with-colour-thanks-to-unprecedented-rain
4/2/2022,"A London-headquartered port operator could be breaching sanctions laws by allowing Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich to dock his $600m (£460m) superyacht Solaris at a port it operates in Turkey. Legal experts said Global Ports Holding, which has been listed on the London Stock Exchange since 2007, was taking “a very big risk” by allowing a superyacht owned by a sanctioned individual to use one of its ports. Solaris, which is 140m long and boasts a helipad and swimming pool, arrived at Bodrum Cruise Port last week, according to shipping intelligence service Marine Traffic. The port is one of 22 terminals run by Global Ports Holding, which is headquartered in Mayfair in London.Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea Football Club, is one of several Russian billionaires hit by UK sanctions last month as part of the government’s efforts to put pressure on Vladimir Putin to end the invasion of Ukraine. Boris Johnson described the sanctioned individuals as having “the blood of the Ukrainian people on their hands”. Lawyers said Global Ports Holding was probably risking a breach of UK sanctions laws if it accepted port or other fees for hosting a superyacht linked to someone subjected to financial sanctions. UK sanction laws prevent British companies from accepting payments from companies or assets controlled by sanctioned individuals. Michael Biltoo, a partner at law firm Kennedys, said Global Port Holdings was “certainly at risk … a very big risk” of breaching UK sanctions. “If we were advising them, we’d say, ‘Stop, you need to make a number of checks,’” he told the FT. Simon Taylor, a partner at Forensic Risk Alliance, said: “The UK is invoking strict liability for sanctions laws and closing any perceived loopholes fast. Companies must be alert to potential risk, particularly in high profile cases, and as move quickly as possible to avoid penalties and reputational damage.” Global Ports Holding did not respond to requests for comment. Ukrainian protesters tried to stop Solaris mooring at the port last week. Members of the Optimist Sailing Team Ukraine confronted the vessel in a small boat, chanting “no war in Ukraine” and waving the country’s flag. They were part of a junior sailing team that was in Turkey to compete in an annual competition, having left Ukraine before the Russian invasion. The Solaris had been undergoing urgent repairs in Barcelona, but left hurriedly on 8 March as European Union countries began seizing sanctioned individuals’ assets. Four days later it stopped at the port of Tivat in Montenegro, which is not in the EU, before arriving in Bodrum. Turkey has refused to impose sanctions on Russians despite the UK, US and EU uniting to impose restrictions on oligarchs believed to have benefited from close relationships with Putin. The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, this week said the oligarchs were “of course” welcome and could do business in Turkey according to international law. Eclipse, another even larger superyacht owned by Abramovich, is also currently moored in Turkey. Eclipse, which at 162.5m is believed to be the world’s second-largest superyacht, arrived at the port of Marmaris on 22 March.",News/World news,London-based port operator accused over Abramovich $600m superyacht,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/01/london-based-port-operator-accused-over-abramovich-600m-superyacht
