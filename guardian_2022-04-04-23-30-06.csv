4/4/2022,"An Arkansas man who woke up after spending 19 years in a coma has died. Terry Wayne Wallis, who woke up from an almost 20-year coma in 2003, died last Tuesday at the age of 57, according to an obituary posted by a funeral home. In July 1984, six weeks after the birth of Wallis’s daughter, Amber, he and a friend were in a serious car accident, in which their car fell into a creek. The wreck was found underneath a bridge the following day, reported the Associated Press in 2003. Wallis’s friend died and Wallis, who was paralyzed in the crash, fell into a coma. Wallis stayed in the coma until 12 June 2003, when he uttered a word: “Mom.” The word shocked doctors who believed he would remain unconscious for ever. “He started out with ‘Mom’ and surprised her and then it was ‘Pepsi’ and then it was ‘milk’,” Alesha Badgley, the social director of Wallis’s rehab facility, told the Associated Press then. “And now it’s anything he wants to say.” Angilee Wallis, Terry’s mom, said: “I couldn’t tell you my first thought, I just fell over on the floor.” Wallis’s awakening garnered media and medical attention, with headlines calling him “The Man Who Slept for 19 Years”. “We all, the whole family, missed out on his company,” said Sandi Wallis, his wife. Wallis was “relentlessly” cared for by his family during his coma and after regaining consciousness, his obituary said. Wallis’s family brought him home on alternate weekends, which doctors believed contributed to his eventual waking up. After news of his death, Wallis was remembered for his sense of humor and being a “great teaser”. He enjoyed listening to live music played by his brother Perry Wallis, “eating anything at anytime” and drinking Pepsi, the obituary said. Wallis is survived by his daughter, several grandchildren, his father and his three siblings, who all live in Big Flat, Arkansas.

4/4/2022,"A defiant Pep Guardiola has joked about “overthinking” the Champions League knockout stage in the past with “stupid tactics”, but the Manchester City manager insisted he will not change his approach. City host Atlético Madrid in Tuesday’s quarter-final first leg with Guardiola intent on leading them to a first triumph in the competition. They reached last season’s final but the manager was criticised for not choosing a recognised holding midfielder, dropping his regular left-back, João Cancelo, and selecting an out-of-favour Raheem Sterling, who had played only eight minutes of the semi-final victory over Paris Saint-Germain. City lost 1-0 to Chelsea, with Cancelo’s replacement, Oleksandr Zinchenko, failing to mark Kai Havertz when the latter ran through to score the winner. Guardiola was also scrutinised for fielding Ilkay Gündogan on the left at Liverpool when City lost 3-0 in a last-eight first leg in 2018, playing a three-man defence before being eliminated two years ago by Lyon, and for dropping Kevin De Bruyne at Tottenham 12 months before, failing to score there and being subsequently knocked out on away goals. Perhaps referencing these defeats, Guardiola offered a wry response to his critics. “In the Champions League I always overthink,” the Catalan said. “I always create new tactics and ideas, and tomorrow you will see a new one. I overthink a lot, that’s why I have very good results in the Champions League. I love it. It would be boring if I always played the same way. If people think I will play the same against Atlético and Liverpool [City’s next opponent], well, I don’t think like that because the movements from Liverpool are completely different than Atlético – especially because the players are all different. “Every player has a mother and father and the mother and father give different personalities to the players. That’s why I love to overthink and create stupid tactics, and when we don’t win I am punished. Tonight I will take inspiration and I’m going to do incredible tactics tomorrow – we play with 12 tomorrow.” Atlético’s penchant for using tactical fouls and pressurising the referee was apparent in the 1-0 victory at Manchester United that took them through in the last round. Yet Guardiola respects the Spanish champions and indicated he would have no concern using a similar approach. “We’ll have to do the same to defend our position,” he said. “I’m not going to judge for one second what they do, just try and get a result on Tuesday then to go to Madrid [for the return leg].” Guardiola pointed to November’s 2-0 Premier League win at United. “I don’t know what playing ugly is. Bernardo [Silva] spent four minutes in the corner at Old Trafford [at the end]. So, defend our position. That’s all I’m here to talk about: what we try to play. I never judge the opponent, what they do and try to do – they try to do it to win.” Guardiola has faced Diego Simeone’s team three previous times – when in charge of Barcelona and Bayern Munich, losing with the latter side in the 2016 Champions League semi-finals on away goals. “It has not been very often because we do not play in the same country. In the Champions League we’ve met just once,” the 51-year-old said. “I think after watching Atlético, there is a misconception about the way he plays. It’s more offensive than people could believe. He doesn’t want to take the risk in the build-up, but after they have quality and play really well in the final third. “They don’t want to take risks, but when the ball is over our halfway, the quality of the players they have and how competitive they are … they know it depends on the position of the ball and the movement. They know how they have to play in these moments. It depends on where the ball is, the moment of the game: winning or losing, last minutes or early minutes, beginning of the second half. In these moments they are really good.” Silva recognised that Atlético are a tough opponent but was confident City will progress. “They’re a very competitive side, very organise with a very specific style of play. I’m pretty sure it won’t be easy for us but if we follow Pep’s plan and do our jobs it is going to work out,” said the Portuguese forward. Of Silva’s comments Guardiola said: “It surprised me that he said that as we haven’t spoken about it yet. But he knows me – of course I have a plan but in this competition, I learn that the plan is important … don’t give an inch, defend when you have to, attack. “I take responsibility on my shoulders but to the players I say: ‘You are the guys who have to win out there.’ They’ve done it before and they have to do it again.”",Sport/Football,Pep Guardiola jokes about his ‘stupid tactics’ in Champions League,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/04/pep-guardiola-jokes-about-his-stupid-tactics-in-champions-league
4/4/2022,"Real-life boxing champion Kali Reis makes an indelible impression here as both the lead actor and the co-writer of this dark, unsettling if slightly predictable tale of revenge, violence and sex trafficking, directed and co-written by Josef Kubota Wladyka. Sure, the protagonist she plays goes by the not-dissimilar Kaylee or KO, is also a boxer and has the same half-Native American, half-Cape Verdean ethnic background as Reis. But it takes proper acting talent, boosted by strong direction from Wladyka, to pull the film along the way Reis does. She’s vulnerable, frightening and relentlessly physical. First met being prepped for a fight by her trainer (Shelly Vincent, also a real-life boxer), 29-year-old Kaylee’s career is nearly at an end. If she’s made any money out of it, then that clearly went up her arm in a drug habit she’s only recently kicked, judging by the women’s shelter where she sleeps with a razor tucked inside her cheek just in case someone jumps her in the night. During the day, she waitresses in a diner; but Kaylee is consumed with one overriding ambition, and that’s to find out what happened to her younger sister Weeta (Mainaku Borrero) who went missing some time ago. Her mother Jaya (Kimberly Guerrero) runs a support group – all seemingly Indigenous people like herself, judging by a pan around the room – who all have missing women in their lives. Many of the missing are probably trafficked, and a wall full of missing posters suggests the scale of problem. This tracks with actual statistical fact, but as a baddie says chillingly later on, no one is looking for them because no one cares. Kaylee ends up using herself as bait to find out what happened to Weeta, with ambiguous results. Director Wladyka has worked on both Narcos and Narcos: Mexico, as well as Dirty Hands, a feature about drug smugglers. Clearly, he has a knack for filming crime stories, especially where they overlap with tales of exploitation and the dispossessed underclass. The upstate New York location, filmed in winter so everything is covered in snow and everyone wears parkas and woolly hats, represents a setting that you wouldn’t expect for a story on this kind of topic.

4/4/2022,"Western outrage has intensified over claims of civilian killings by Russian troops in Ukraine, with EU leaders denouncing “massacres”, “atrocities” and “possible genocide” as the Kremlin flatly rejected all responsibility. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said the bloc was urgently working on a new round of sanctions against Moscow, adding: “Russian authorities are responsible for these atrocities, committed while they had effective control of the area.” Amid an international outcry following the weekend discovery of a mass grave and corpses with their hands bound in the town of Bucha, near Kyiv, Borrell said the EU stood in solidarity with Ukraine during “sombre hours for the whole world”. As the UN security council prepared to discuss Ukraine on Tuesday, the international body’s human rights commissioner, Michelle Bachelet, told its human rights council that strikes and heavy shelling during Russia’s invasion had killed civilians in acts that may amount to war crimes. The security council would not meet on Monday, as requested by Russia, to discuss what Moscow called Ukraine’s “heinous provocation”, said the British mission, which holds the presidency of the 15-member council for April. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the atrocities would inevitably complicate peace talks due to restart by video on Monday. The killings were “war crimes and will be recognised by the world as genocide”, Zelenskiy said. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, called for an international investigation into what he termed a “genocide” carried out by Russian troops, saying it was essential to “find out the truth on the extent of Russian fascist crimes”. Urging tougher western sanctions and an end to “negotiations with criminals”, Morawiecki said the “bloody massacres committed by Russian soldiers deserve to be called what they are. This is genocide, and it must be judged.” The Polish leader criticised efforts over the past several weeks by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to keep lines of communication open with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, saying: “Nobody negotiated with Hitler.” He told the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, that Berlin, which fears the economic consequences of suddenly halting imports of Russian gas, should not be listening to “German business leaders and German billionaires”, but “the voices of innocent women and children”. Macron said on Monday there were very “clear clues pointing to war crimes” by Russian forces in Bucha and that new sanctions were needed, including on Russian oil and coal. Scholz said Putin and his supporters “will feel the consequences” and new sanctions would be agreed in the coming days. Germany’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, raised the possibility of an end to gas imports, while the foreign minister of Italy – another country reliant on Russian gas – said it would not veto energy sanctions. Other European officials, including the Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said the EU “must respond strongly”. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said the west must do everything in its power to ensure those responsible for “these alleged cases of crimes against humanity, war crimes and – why not say it too – genocide” did not go unpunished. The Kremlin, which has repeatedly denied targeting civilians, on Monday rejected all accusations related to the murder of civilians in Bucha, saying Ukrainian allegations should be treated with scepticism and suggesting images of corpses “do not correspond to reality”. “We categorically reject all allegations,” said the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, claiming that Russian defence ministry experts had “identified signs of video fakes and various fakes” and asking international leaders not to “rush to sweeping accusations and at least listen to our arguments”. Officials in Brussels said a fresh set of punitive measures against Moscow would be discussed this week, with EU foreign ministers due to consider the package either on the sidelines of a Nato meeting on Wednesday and Thursday or early next week. Ukrainian authorities have said they are investigating possible war crimes by Russian forces after finding 421 bodies in civilian clothes, some with their hands tied, strewn around several towns outside the capital, including Bucha, after Moscow’s troops withdrew from the area around the capital. Showing their partially covered bodies to reporters, Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior ministry, said on Monday the head of one village, Motyzhyn, her husband and their son had all been shot and buried in a shallow grave. “The occupiers suspected they were collaborating with our military, giving us locations of where to target our artillery,” Herashchenko said. “These scum tortured, slaughtered and killed the whole family. They will be held responsible for this.” Zelenskiy on Sunday described Russian soldiers as “murderers”, “butchers” and “rapists”, and warned that “even worse things” could be found in other occupied regions. The US said on Monday it would ask the UN general assembly to suspend Russia from the body’s human rights council after the atrocities. A two-thirds majority vote by the 193-member assembly in New York can suspend a state from the council for persistently committing gross and systematic violations of human rights. Speaking in Bucharest on Monday, Washington’s ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said: “Russia’s participation on the human rights council is a farce. And it is wrong, which is why we believe it is time the UN general assembly vote to remove them.” The Kremlin said Russia’s diplomats at the UN would press on with their efforts to convene a security council meeting despite their first effort being blocked. Europe’s worst conflict in decades, sparked by Russia’s invasion on 24 February, has already killed 20,000 people, according to Ukrainian estimates. The UN refugee agency said on Monday more than 4.2 million refugees had fled the country. “The humanitarian needs are growing by the minute as more people flee the war in Ukraine,” the International Organization for Migration said, adding that in addition to Ukrainian refugees, nearly 205,500 non-Ukrainians living, studying or working in the country had left and nearly 6.5 million people were internally displaced.",News/World news,EU leaders denounce ‘possible genocide’ in Ukraine as Russia issues denials,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/eu-leaders-denounce-possible-genocide-ukraine-russia-denials
4/4/2022,"If the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge need some comfort reading after their awkward Caribbean tour, they could do worse than turn to Tony Blair’s autobiography. In 1997, Britain’s new prime minister travelled to Hong Kong to oversee its handover to China. Years later, Blair described how he had struggled through a conversation with the Chinese president, Jiang Zemin, on a subject of UK-China history, because, in his own words, Blair had “only a fairly dim and sketchy understanding of what that past was”. The history being discussed was the opium wars, the very reason why Hong Kong had become British in the first place. Yet here was a boarding school and Oxbridge-educated prime minister who had next to no knowledge of the history that produced the very event he had travelled to oversee. The impression many ministers give today is that students in British classrooms are being bludgeoned with never-ending tales of Britain’s imperial crimes. This is why the government is now looking to rebalance the scales with a new curriculum that highlights the “benefits” of the British empire, as well as its negatives. Building on last year’s controversial Sewell report, the plans promoted by the equalities minister Kemi Badenoch are part of a wider campaign to move the teaching of empire away from what the government fears is a culture of victimisation and identity politics in schools, instead framing the legacy of empire as a debate of pros and cons. Was the empire wrong? Was it right? Which bits of the empire were naughty or nice? But far from being inescapable, it is more common to find a well-policed omertà over the topic of empire within our curriculum. This amnesia about Britain’s imperial past produces a widespread ignorance about what is going on in the world, something that William and Kate recently discovered. Since the protests that greeted the couple during their trip to the Caribbean, Britain’s media has been confused about why Jamaica and other Commonwealth countries are looking to dispense with the Queen as their head of state. Badenoch’s statement on the teaching of empire in schools was a response to the growing calls from students for greater engagement with Britain’s imperial legacy. But her approach only reinforces the culture war that she claims to be trying to overcome. Learning about empire, according to her plan, becomes a game of discussing positives and negatives that are given equal weight. This interminable back-and-forth argument over the morality of a centuries-long process will circulate endlessly, ultimately making the topic feel like a pointless dispute over a long-distant past. Yet empire is anything but ancient history. The British empire only came to an end during the 1950s and 1960s. Prior to this, empire shaped the life of this island for some 400 years. England’s establishment of the Virginia slave colonies or its colonial rule over Barbados stretches back to before the Act of Union, the Glorious Revolution and even the English civil war. It would be very strange if this entire period in history had left no lasting impact on today’s political, cultural, economic or legal systems. Yet for many people, it is still not unusual to complete school, college and even university in the UK without hearing the empire referred to even once. Recently, issues such as the royal tour of the Caribbean, the Windrush scandal or the Russian oligarchs profiting from the secrecy protections of British overseas territories have pushed Britain’s imperial legacy on to the front pages. Such events remind us that empire isn’t a question of moral judgment about a bygone era. Empire is still shaping our world. How can we reflect this reality in the curriculum? One answer would be moving the teaching of empire beyond the history class and into other subjects across the humanities and social sciences. Currently, students can study for their GCSE in citizenship without learning that all the people of the British empire, from Lagos to London, had the same citizenship status of “British subject” until 1948. On an A-level law course, students can be introduced to the British constitutional system with no mention that the Queen is still the head of state in places such as Jamaica, the Bahamas and Bermuda, or that her privy council serves as the highest court in these countries. English literature students can read canonical books such as Jane Eyre or Mansfield Park without considering the colonial settings that provide the background to these stories. Economics students read entire textbooks about development without discussing how this topic emerged from the decolonisation of Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. Such imperial amnesia renders pertinent questions in a number of disciplines off limits. There is no reason why the Windrush scandal shouldn’t be a topic of study across the citizenship curriculum, or why offshore Britain and global tax avoidance shouldn’t be discussed in economics classes. Expanding the pathways through which students engage with the legacy of empire would do far more to move the topic away from divisive identity politics than Badenoch’s plan of renewing the argument about who are the “goodies” or “baddies” of history. In fact, her commitment to highlighting the “benefits of empire” is paradigmatic identity politics. It is designed to turn empire into a totem that people feel proud about, rather than as a lens to think critically about the world. We should expect nothing less from a politician who last year told her colleagues she doesn’t “care about colonialism”. Previously, Badenoch has described the growing calls for decolonisation of curriculums in schools, colleges and universities as a “recent fad” that is “not just misguided but actively opposed to the fundamental purpose of education”. She has even threatened that those teaching race and empire in schools without “offering a balanced treatment of opposing views” are at risk of “breaking the law”. In a climate where legal threats from the government are supported by newspaper attacks on “woke schools” accused of teaching “critical race theory”, it would be understandable if teachers choose to avoid the subject of empire altogether. The government’s recent guidance on political impartiality in teaching specifically highlighted “topics relating to empire” when reminding teachers that they “can also be subject to a prohibition order if their actions or behaviours undermine fundamental British values”. Such a charged atmosphere doesn’t exactly encourage fearless and creative teaching of a complicated but important issue. This recent campaign seems primarily intended to renew silence on empire in British schools. If it succeeds, students will be receiving an education that trains them to be ignorant of major issues that inform the world they will inhabit. And like Tony Blair or William and Kate, they will have to navigate global society with “only a dim and sketchy understanding” of Britain’s role in the making of it.

4/4/2022,"Ministers are finally acknowledging what has been patently obvious since the beginning of the pandemic: Covid is associated with far more than the oft-cited symptoms of high temperature, persistent cough and loss of sense of smell and taste. With little fanfare, a further nine potential symptoms have now been added to the official list on the NHS website, including diarrhoea, loss of appetite, sore throat and tiredness. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recognised many of these symptoms since April 2020, as have numerous other governments. So why has the UK taken so long – and will anyone take any notice? British scientists have long called for a broadening of the official symptoms list. According to research published in February 2021, the inclusion of fatigue, sore throat, headache and diarrhoea in the criteria to qualify for a PCR test could have enabled 96% of symptomatic cases to be detected – a third more than relying on the “classic” three symptoms alone. Indeed, some scientists suspect it’s precisely because access to free testing has been scrapped for most people in England that the government has updated the list. “We were always told that the barrier to expanding the list was that adding more symptoms could overwhelm the testing capacity, so it makes sense that since free testing has now stopped, the list has been updated,” said Prof Tim Spector, lead researcher of the Zoe Covid symptom study app, who has been lobbying for this change for two years. Although the addition of more symptoms “is definitely a step in the right direction and it could help reduce infections as we go forward”, Spector would also have liked to seen them reordered – fever, a new continuous cough, and a loss or change to your sense of smell are still listed in positions one to three – yet they are much less common in the Omicron variant era. “According to the Zoe Covid study, the top five symptoms being reported by contributors with a positive Covid test are; runny nose (83%), fatigue (71%), sore throat (69%), headache (69%) and sneezing (68%),” Spector said. Others question how helpful it is to expand the symptoms list, now that the majority of people cannot access tests without paying for them. “Better late than never, one might say, but the problem is that none of this is much help if you can’t test to make more certain whether you have Covid or not,” said Prof Stephen Reicher, a psychologist at the University of St Andrews and member of the now disbanded Sage subcommittee advising on behavioural science. “Indeed, precisely because Omicron presents more like a cold, it is more important than ever to test in order to see what the symptoms mean.” Presumably, the change is designed to encourage people to behave responsibly, and limit contact with other people if they develop any of these symptoms. But you only have to walk down your local high street to see that the public mood has shifted. On the other hand, what are people supposed to do? Asking everyone with any of the listed symptoms to isolate as if they have Covid would be overkill, and only increase the number of teachers, healthcare staff and other essential workers who are off sick – and many essential and non-essential workers can’t afford to take time off work “just in case”. Neither are many prepared to waste concert or theatre tickets, miss out on parties or forgo weekend shopping trips, in case their runny nose is Covid. Far easier to assume it isn’t. Reicher said: “Yet again, this is ‘rearranging the deckchairs’ stuff from a government which refuses to do the obvious thing and restore free testing, as well as restoring or extending support for self-isolation, so people can do the right thing if they are Covid positive. “The government has sent out so many messages that ‘it’s all over’ and so ‘infections don’t really matter’ that it is difficult for anyone to think it matters.”",News/World news,Why has it taken so long to add more Covid symptoms to NHS list?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/why-has-the-uk-taken-so-long-to-add-covid-symptoms
