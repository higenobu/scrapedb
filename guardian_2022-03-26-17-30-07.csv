3/26/2022,"As the pandemic slashed through the UK’s restaurants like a sharpened cleaver, one slice of the industry fared far worst than most: pizza and burger chains. Byron, Gourmet Burger Kitchen and Italian chains Strada and Carluccio’s were among the casual dining brands forced to shed dozens of sites as repeated lockdowns and other Covid restrictions left the chains haemorrhaging cash. A net 11.4% of chain restaurants, or about 700 outlets, have disappeared since March 2020, according to the Local Data Company (LDC) which monitors 3,000 areas across England, Scotland and Wales. Italian and pizza restaurants chains shrunk by a net 22% or 448 sites during two years of the pandemic, while American-themed chains fell by a net 21% or 151 outlets, figures from the Local Data Company (LDC) reveal. Despite the heartbreak for those made redundant, the celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay credited the Covid-19 pandemic with clearing away “crap” restaurants. Ramsay this week argued that there might now be a new beginning as the experience of lockdown, where families killed time by cooking more from scratch at home, as well as raising appreciation of well-made food. In an interview with the former shadow chancellor Ed Balls in Radio Times, Ramsay described the shrunken chains as: “Well, just shitholes in a prime position and taking advantage because they’re in a great location, and they’ve got the footfall. But now we’ve wiped the slate clean, which is good.” Ramsay should know about the perils of the pandemic: his own chain of 25 London restaurants lost £5.1m in the year to the end of August 2020. The trade association UK Hospitality said almost 700,000 jobs were affected at the peak of the pandemic – a combination of job losses, plus roles that were not needed due to tourist seasons being heavily affected. The clear-out reversed the effects of a desperate land grab fuelled by private equity cash over the previous four or five years, where customers were lured with generous discounts and vouchers, but left businesses locked into expensive sites, often too close to similar outlets. The Restaurant Group, which owns Frankie & Benny’s, Garfunkel’s and Chiquitos, and the Casual Dining Group, which owns Café Rouge and Bella Italia, both closed dozens of outlets, rapidly exiting sites they might have planned to close over five or more years. But finally, green shoots are emerging. The pandemic has cleared a path for new names which are rapidly expanding, including Pizza Pilgrims, Rosa’s Thai – which has plans for six more sites a year – and Shoryu Ramen, which is looking for franchise partners to expand beyond its current nine sites. Independents have also stepped into the gaps left by the chains. The number of local restaurants has increased since March 2020 – up by 3.7% or 888 more according to LDC – as cheaper rents have made it easier for entrepreneurs to start new businesses. Stefan Chomka, the editor of Restaurant magazine, says the pandemic has changed the balance of power between landlords and restaurateurs, opening the way for cheaper rent deals. “[Landlords] are much more willing to give smaller nimbler restaurant groups a go,” he says. Paul Askew, the owner of The Art School fine dining restaurant in Liverpool opened a second outlet, Barnacle, in Duke Street Market in December just as the hospitality industry was hit by a fresh wave of cancellations prompted by fears of the Omicron Covid wave. He says many good businesses failed because they had unhelpful landlords or their business insurance did not pay up but he was able to expand because he was offered rents linked to sales after another restaurant failed. “We took a gamble and it seems to have hopefully paid off,” he adds. Askew says that despite difficulties with rising costs, staff shortages and the prospect of higher VAT the market has bounced back with “a tsunami of bookings” since reopening. “With disposable income cut, you might go out less and if you go somewhere it will be where they are going to give you a really good time with better service and better food. Chomka sees small brands with fewer than five sites as the ones that will really benefit from the changes wrought by the pandemic as they can now offer “that young feel that landlords are really craving”. “They could double or triple their sites in a short amount of time,” he says. He says “it is not about big brands any more” and landlords are looking to curate sites with more variety, and less familiar names creating space for a new wave of private equity-backed brands. Restaurants are also battling with food, wage and energy inflation, while household incomes are under intense pressure. Peter Backman, an independent restaurant consultant, says that competition for cash is likely to be tougher as many of the private equity firms that were previously investing in restaurants had their fingers burnt. “A lot have pulled out and they probably won’t come back at least for a while,” he says. But Graeme Smith at the consultancy Alix Partners, who works with restaurant investors, says interest is still there. In August, TriSpan ploughed money into the Vietnamese street food chain Pho, US fund Fortress recently bought Punch Pubs while Alchemy Partners bought Brasserie Bar Co, the company behind Brasserie Blanc and the White Brasserie foodie pubs. He admits the days of expecting to rapidly roll out a brand to 400 sites are probably over but says there is “still a lot of interest” from private equity in the restaurant world. Britons’ taste for takeaways during multiple lockdowns has driven a boom time for brands such as German Doner Kebab, Crosstown Donuts, the healthy eating brand Choppaluna – which has 60 sites in the pipeline – and the dessert specialist Creams which now has 100 outlets in partnership with local franchisees. Backman says about 10-20% of restaurants’ business now tends to be made up of delivery income, with some opening dark kitchens or starting up new brands out of their existing kitchens to cater specifically for takeaways. The Azzurri Group, for example, uses spare capacity in its Zizzi and Ask Italian restaurants to supply its Coco di Mama takeaway business. Meanwhile, chains such as Zizzi and Leon are diversifying into supermarket ready meals or new locations such as drive-thrus and motorway service stations. New ways of business are partly being driven by trade investors such as the Issa Brothers – who bought healthy takeaways group Leon Restaurants to complement their motorway services business and the supermarket chain Asda. Ranjit Singh Boparan, the food industry tycoon behind 2 Sisters Food Group, has also been snapping up troubled restaurant brands – including Giraffe, Ed’s Diner and Carluccio’s and Gourmet Burger Kitchen. Chomka says that in straitened times these brands are “trying to sweat all their assets”. “It’s no longer good enough to just open a restaurant and serve people.”",News/Business,‘It’s not about big brands’: how will UK casual dining fare after Covid?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/26/uk-casual-dining-covid-independent-restaurants
3/26/2022,"Excellent affordable foundations are usually as rare as hen’s teeth – then a load all arrive at once, like bills. No sooner had I emptied a bottle of the outstanding L’Oreal Paris True Match Tinted Serum (£13.99) – at least a dozen of you have stopped me in the outside world, just to tell me that it’s one of your favourite ever column-inspired purchases – than the Body Shop’s new Fresh Nude Foundation (£18) dropped through the letterbox. And what an unexpected joy it is. Moist, fresh-looking and comfy on all skins (even dry ones), it gives precisely the sort of light-medium coverage I favour: too much for pyjama days, too little for wedding days, but you could get away with either at a push. (Incidentally, the brand describes Fresh Nude as “medium coverage”, which, to my eye, both overstates and undersells it.) It applies sheerly and smoothly and gives a lovely eggshell finish – neither shiny nor matte – that lasts pretty well until bed. The whole shebang is 100% vegan and recyclable (the bottle is glass and it has replaced the ever-tricky pump with a wooden spatula, which is good for scraping out every last bit). My only complaint is that even though the number of shades stands at an impressive 40, there are a couple missing from the lineup, including mine (Light 3 Neutral doesn’t exist for this product), so I settled on Light 3 Warm, which is a tad too golden. Nonetheless, if you can find your perfect match, Fresh Nude is well worth the relatively affordable price tag. Even cheaper is Kind & Free (£9.49), the first base in years from Rimmel London that I’ve loved. It is only around half the price of the Body Shop one, though if you have dry skin, you would be better off sticking with the former. For everyone else, this is a doozie and hard to beat for the price. It smooshes on evenly and juicily, leaving a light, comfy and seasonally appropriate veil of healthy colour. It has a casual feel but certainly delivers enough coverage to unify skin tone, blur a little and look deceptively effortful. Here the shade range is smaller but, as with all sheer bases, one colour will span multiple shades, and Rimmel has catered for most people pretty well. Most positively, Kind & Free is not tested on animals and, from what I am hearing on the unofficial grapevine, the brand is finally working towards full cruelty-free accreditation. I hope that’s true, and will be sure to keep you informed.",Lifestyle/Fashion,"Cover stars: meet the new wave of strong, affordable foundations | Sali Hughes",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/26/meet-the-new-wave-of-excellent-high-street-foundations
3/26/2022,"Ilike Gordon Ramsay, even (especially? Something to interrogate in therapy, perhaps) when he’s yelling. The beauty of Ramsay is he is capable of dialling the self-mythologising machismo up and down at will, depending on the shape of the show around him. So in Hell’s Kitchen, he was consistently history’s worst ever bastard. In MasterChef Junior, he was oddly delicate and encouraging. In The F Word, he’s all staccato sentences while chain-making beef wellington in a bizarre, “Why are you bothering me at home?” approach to hospitality. And in Kitchen Nightmares, he is at his best, a laser-focused problem-solver who goes ego-to-ego with failed head chef after failed head chef, making people cry the bad way at the start of every show – and the good way by the end. So the question ahead of Gordon Ramsay’s Future Food Stars (Thursday, 9pm, BBC One), which is just The Apprentice but for food entrepreneurs, is: which Gordon Ramsay is going to turn up? The raging beast or the quizshow host? The Michelin star ambitionist or the bloke who keeps doing pranks where he wears prosthetics? Well, how to put this: in his entrance into this show, he jumps out of a helicopter into the sea. No, I don’t know why Gordon Ramsay is jumping out of a helicopter into the sea. Neither do any of the assembled food entrepreneurs (lockdown salmon-smokers and farmers’ market jam-makers, mostly). Gordon barks at them out of a wetsuit while dripping into the sand at Newquay, explaining the show (a £150,000 investment as the grand prize; each week, a “challenge” to “test their mettle”; a grave promise that it’s going to be tough). Eventually, finally, we get some explanation: just as Gordon has “made a leap of faith for them”, so they have to make a leap of faith for him. They all have to put wetsuits on and jump in the sea. Why aren’t they cooking? Why is a pre-requirement for this cooking competition the ability to swim 500m through open water then scramble over some rocks? We are 15 minutes in and nobody has touched a single pan. I am starting to fear Future Food Stars is less a TV cooking competition and more a hyper-produced and very belated Gordon Ramsay stag do. It warms up from there. If you’re an Apprentice fan (I am, even – especially? – when Alan Sugar is yelling at someone), the vague format will be familiar to you: it’s like the food challenge week from The Apprentice, but every week. Contestants are split into teams and after a profit task reveals the losing team, they are asked to tell on each other to identify the point of failure. Gordon gathers them all into a room in businesswear. One person gets pointed at with a significant finger and sent home. You know, like The Apprentice. Although, I have to say it’s The Apprentice if The Apprentice were conceived in 2022: contestants are actually allowed to communicate with each other, and conduct mild market research, and at no point are they forced to act and star in their own terrible TV adverts. Week one sees three teams compete to see who can sell the most food from a stall on a Newquay beach, and obviously a lot goes wrong – a late change in the line-cook responsibilities almost leads to war; someone genuinely cries over a taco; a lot of mango dressing ends up on the floor – but there are successful moments, too. While the teams cook, Ramsay goes around Newquay highlighting the local food scene. It’s exactly what this show should be doing, and it does it well. I’m still thinking about the helicopter (why? Why?) but the subsequent 45 minutes really make up for it. There are teething problems – as with any first-series show, it has to find its tone, and contestants never quite know if they are meant to be fighting (I suppose their adrenaline is still pumping from the cliff dive) or getting along – an argument about a mushroom threatens to derail the entire first episode in its out-of-nowhere ferocity, and a squabble about monkfish really makes you want to go: “Guys, guys, it’s just TV.” But there’s a germ of a very, very good show here, as soon as Gordon Ramsay stops jumping out of things and just hosts it. Maybe this will lead to 15 more series and an American spin-off that eventually changes world politics for ever! Or maybe this will lead to a terrible accident that changes how TV stunts are conducted for the rest of time! I am excited to see which of the two it is.",Arts/Television & radio,Gordon Ramsay’s Future Food Stars: it’s The Apprentice meets food – with added helicopters,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/26/gordon-ramsays-future-food-stars-its-the-apprentice-meets-food-with-added-helicopters
3/26/2022,"The latest edition of the Indian Premier League kicks off this weekend. It poses some interesting questions. The IPL is gripping, high-grade stuff. Like me you may well end up watching every second of it, even as you complain loudly about the fact that, oh look, you’re watching every second of it. But starting again? Really? Was there an extended period in the last two years where you could say with any real certainty that the IPL had actually stopped? Perhaps in future it might be easier to assume, unless specifically stated otherwise, that the IPL is still going on. That somewhere in the rolling T20 metaverse the commentator who shouts “wow!” at everything is shouting “wow!” as a man in a shirt daubed with cement manufacturers flat-bats one over cover, that this is simply the engine around which every other moving part rotates now. But it still feels a week too early. England’s men are still playing a Test match. There’s football happening, because football must always happen. But my main objection to this sudden blotting out of the cricketing sun is that the 50-over Women’s World Cup in New Zealand is in danger of being overshadowed just as it threatens to bubble up into a genuinely gripping endgame. It has been an absorbing tournament so far, simmering away, gathering depth and layers, and deserving of a free run in its final week. The weekend will see the semi-finalists culled. From the start of next week one of four contenders, South Africa, West Indies, India and England, will have the chance to create a genuine story by beating Australia, who are simply much better than everyone else right now, a team playing with a kind of light around them. It has been an intriguing tournament for England, and beyond that for one of the most storied English cricketers of the age, a performer of engaging and apparently inexhaustible competitive fury. Katherine Brunt has had a frustrating couple of weeks. Although, to be fair, every week appears to be on some level a frustrating week for a cricketer powered by uncut fast-bowler-grade irritation. This is the natural resting state of Brunt, a bowler for whom every straw is the final straw, whose competitive rage is both endlessly watchable and a driver for one of the great modern-day English sporting careers. Brunt had bowled poorly in New Zealand before taking three wickets in Thursday’s victory against Pakistan, fruits of some hard-fought technical tinkering in the nets. That win leaves England needing to beat Bangladesh on Saturday to be sure of making the semis, a major turnaround after losing their first three games. And there has been something wrong with England at this World Cup. They have looked underpowered and muddled, a little soggy in those bleached-out greens and greys down the late night satellite feed. The initial selection looked like a continuity thing: one more dip for the old guard. But this has looked a stodgy crew at times, unathletic and lacking in fizz, the kind of team it’s harder to get in to than out of. The spinners Sophie Ecclestone and Charlie Dean have revived England’s chances. But in terms of wickets and averages England’s new ball attack, Brunt and Anya Shrubsole are two of the least successful bowlers in the tournament. Brunt, at least, will not be cowed. This is a cricketer who has a highly productive, career-long relationship with adversity, who has made a life out of refusing to stop, and who seems at all times entirely lost in this thing. Her story bears repeating. As a kid she spent evenings throwing a tennis ball at the mismatched brick in the wall of the family home, refusing to come in for dinner until she had hit it. At school she was bullied for being “a bit of an oddball”, and for being overweight. She trained with England’s juniors but hated it (“they were not very nice people”). She got into drinking. She gave up cricket. One day she decided she didn’t want that. She went running with her dad, a little further each day, and eventually dropped four stone. Barnsley CC became a home. When she came back to the England setup aged 19 some of her former training mates didn’t recognise her as the same person. From there it is easy to take for granted quite how relentlessly good Brunt has been, and for how long. She was England Vodafone cricketer of the year in 2006 alongside Andrew Flintoff. Three career-menacing back injuries have followed, the last at the 2018 World T20, which she left in a wheelchair. But she’s still out there: a double World Cup winner, with 316 England wickets at 22, still offering control, contributing with the bat now, and still applying that unwavering will, utterly engaged in every moment of every game. There is more of course. Brunt came out as gay to her parents aged 21. It fractured her relationship with her mother. But her family is still close and her dad sounds amazing. And if some of this makes her seem like a sad story, or a heavy presence, then she is clearly not those things. Brunt is exuberant, funny, and relentlessly energetic in training. She has a house, known as “Alan”, that has been a kind of salon for England women’s cricket down the years, and which is now shared with her fiance and England teammate, Nat Sciver, two halves (with all due apologies: but it’s true) of an outstandingly high-grade English sporting power couple. What now? Brunt is 36, but still out there bouncing in with the same cartoon-squirrel sense of optimism. From here England have, at best, three World Cup games to play. The chances of beating Australia are slim, the chance of getting a shot decent enough. A fully operational Brunt will guarantee at the very least a sense of will, of something grand and unyielding, perhaps even the chance of a rare late bloom. British sport is full of gonged-up head prefect types, celebrity filler described, often laughably, as inspiration. Brunt is the real thing, a true original, and an authentically inspiring cricketer.",Sport/Sport,Katherine Brunt will not be cowed despite England’s World Cup toils | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/26/katherine-brunt-will-not-be-cowed-despite-englands-world-cup-toils
3/26/2022,"There had been many long hours of rocket strikes and shelling before the attack that upended their lives, but always with grim warning, the explosions creeping closer to Diana Zubchencko’s ninth-floor home in Kharkiv. Then, 10 days into the war, with no notice, their home was ripped apart and its contents hurled on top of the family. One minute they were cooking dinner, the next Diana was sprawled on the ground, bleeding so much from a head injury that her mother, Victoria, feared the 18-year-old was slipping away. A rocket had slammed into the neighbouring high-rise, and the force of the blast had lifted a door off its hinges and slammed it into the side of Diana’s head. When an ambulance rushed her to hospital – emergency services are braving shelling to pick up the injured – doctors were able to save her life, but not her left eye. “It is very difficult for me to talk about that time because she was dying,” Victoria said from her daughter’s bedside as the thud of artillery echoed in the background. “I’ve got used to the bombing now, it’s not scary after what I’ve lived through. I watched my child almost die. “I’m just very happy she is alive, she lived, and she understands everything. Her brain could have been damaged. It is a miracle.” Scores of people are thought to have been killed and thousands injured by Russian attacks in Kharkiv, scene of some of the worst devastation of the war outside besieged Mariupol. Just about 25 miles from the Russian border, locals say the city is being is being punished for its resilience after it held off Russian forces in the first days of the invasion. Because it cannot rout Ukraine’s soldiers there, Moscow has turned its long-range artillery on civilians such as Diana, who now are filling Kharkiv’s hospital beds or the corridors of its morgues. Here, the war is in the heart of the city, every day. A missile ripped into city hall, rockets punch gaping holes in the elegant central streets, and the outlying residential neighbourhoods bear the deadliest toll. On Thursday six civilians were killed by a rocket while they were queueing for humanitarian aid outside a post office. One had been sleeping in the metro station for safety and had come up for some fresh air, witnesses said. On Friday another four people died when a shell landed near a clinic. Many, like the Zubchenckos, are hit in their homes where they have stayed to care for others too old or sick to move. Diana had refused to leave her 93-year-old grandfather, a double amputee. “Life has changed completely, everything is divided between before and after the war. I have not left the hospital for 29 days,” said Oleksandr Dukhovsky, a paediatric neurosurgeon who was treating Diana. He had tended to more than 50 other children brought in with shelling, gunshot and other conflict injuries since the war began. “My mum brought me up as a cynic, but this is very hard. It has brought me to tears,” he said of the terrible influx of young bodies battered by munitions. And that is only the toll in one department in one of the city’s many hospitals. Authorities are reluctant to talk about how many people have been killed in Kharkiv. The regional governor, Oleh Synyehubov, put the official civilian death toll at more than 100, but said that 30 bodies had been retrieved from the wreckage of city hall alone and the actual total would be significantly higher. “There are more,” he said in an interview. “We have the official data from hospitals, but there are places – homes, apartments – where firefighters have gone to put out fires after an attack, but they have not been able to retrieve bodies because the shelling is ongoing.” One central morgue has run out of room indoors for victims – and coffins to hold their remains. Dozens of bodies were lined up in a courtyard, some tied in plastic bags, others wrapped in blankets, and on a sunny afternoon this week vans carrying new bodies arrived about every five minutes. Even as hospitals in the city try to staunch the loss, they fear becoming part of it, after attacks on more than 40 healthcare facilities around the country, including the Mariupol maternity hospital. Many hospitals declined interviews, fearing it would expose their patients to greater risks. At Dukhovsky’s hospital, which the Guardian is not naming, the windows were covered in blackout blinds, many of the patients were in corridors rather than on wards, the sound of artillery was constant, and there had been a gun battle nearby last week. The strict city curfew – from 6pm to 6am – and the intensity of Russian attacks mean most of the doctors and nurses treating Diana and her fellow patients have been living at the hospital since the war began, their ordinary lives suspended overnight. “It’s too hard to find words to describe what is happening in this city,” said Lydmila Ivanova, 68, a senior nurse on the trauma ward. “Who was the church bothering, who was the zoo bothering? It was such a beautiful place, who would attack it in this way?” Her years of experience dealing with car accidents and violence had not prepared her for the horrors of Vladimir Putin’s bombardment. “It is very difficult to bear with the small children coming in,” she said. The ward had only about one-third of its normal staff; some were trapped behind enemy lines, others had decided to leave Kharkiv. So, in addition to nursing, they were all pitching in with cleaning and cooking. “We have a shower here, and a place to wash clothes, and my children have brought me some supplies,” she said. Hospital staff see their work as part of the war effort, they say, and are kept going in part by the gratitude of patients and relatives who have also moved in to help with care. “I bow down on my knees to the doctors and the nurses for not leaving and not going home, and dedicating themselves to saving lives,” said Victoria, Diana’s mother. “The Russians can’t defeat this country. You can see, everyone is doing everything for us.” She was confident that with their help her girl, a sporty, generous student who gave her allowance to charity and doted on their dog Archibald, would make a full recovery. On the next floor down, Volodymyr, seven, was just coming round from brain surgery. His mumbled, fitful words sounded like a call for his mama. He had not yet been told that she was dead, killed in the first week of the war by the round of bullets that shattered his skull. “He needs to be strong to make a full recovery so he can live a full life,” said his father, Stanislav Baclanov, 34. “If I tell him his mother has been killed, it will destroy his desire [to recover]. He must feel well, and after that I will tell him, and we will go to the cemetery together so I can show him her grave.” Baclanov was stranded outside the country on a business trip when the war began, and when shelling intensified in their neighbourhood his wife, Darya, decided to take the children to a different part of the city. He realised something was wrong when she stopped checking in, and his brother called to break the terrible news that the family had been gunned down near a checkpoint. “Darya was like an angel in all her behaviour and love,” he said, his face gaunt and drawn with grief as he waited for his son to come out of surgery. “I can talk about my wife for a long time. She was a loving, open, intelligent, honest, bright person, my closest friend, a gentle flower. She was my sun.” Volodymyr had major neurosurgery after the attack. This week Dukhovsky removed bone fragments and installed two titanium plates put in to protect his brain where the bone is missing, but he is expected to make a full recovery with proper medical care. His father believes it was Ukrainians who opened fire by mistake, and wants the shooting investigated when the country is not consumed by war, he but said that whoever pulled the trigger, his wife’s death – and the family’s unbearable loss – should be counted as part of Russia’s toll in Kharkiv. “It is the most terrible thing that my sons don’t have a mother,” he said. “If the Russians hadn’t come to our land, this wouldn’t have happened.”",News/World news,‘It has brought me to tears’: medics of Kharkiv try to staunch war losses,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/26/it-has-brought-me-to-tears-medics-of-kharkiv-try-to-staunch-war-losses
3/26/2022,"The mythology of the street gang is rooted in American popular culture, from West Side Story to The Warriors to Training Day. But a recent trial in the seemingly endless suburban landscape of Long Island, New York, has thrown a spotlight on the harsh reality of gang activity, and the circumstances in which it flourishes. In particular, one of the most brutal organizations at work in the US: Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13. The details of the trial are horrific. Leniz Escobar, also known as “La Diablita”, is a 22-year-old woman accused of luring five teenagers to a Long Island park in 2017 to smoke marijuana – where they were then ambushed. Four of the five young men – Jorge Tigre, 18; Michael Lopez, 20; Jefferson Villalobos, 18; and Justin Llivicura, 16 – were hacked to death by more than a dozen members of MS-13, a street gang with its roots in El Salvador’s civil war of the 80s and 90s. The brutal murders at the center of the case made headlines in 2017 when MS-13 was identified just 100 days into the new administration by Donald Trump and his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, giving the US public identifiable “bad hombres” of Trump’s often racist fear-the-outsider narrative. John Kelly, then Trump’s secretary of homeland security, described MS-13’s supposed role in smuggling immigrants into the US as “a course north that rivals Dante’s journey into hell”. According to government prosecutors, Escobar helped orchestrate “a horrific frenzy of violence” involving machetes, knives and a chisel, before falsely claiming to be a victim in the ambush. Escobar, aged 17 at the time of the murders and now being tried as an adult, was seeking to curry favor with MS-13 and had alerted its members to the victims’ location, prosecutors say. Escobar has pleaded not guilty to racketeering charges. MS-13, prosecutors allege, had been seeking to settle a score, and believed the victims to be members of the rival 18th Street gang – and that the killings had been “pre-authorized” by gang leadership. The victims’ families have denied that any of the men killed were part of a gang. Escobar, prosecutors further claim, tossed her cellphone from a moving vehicle, destroyed its sim card, and discarded her bloodied clothing. Soon after the killings, they allege, she told her high-ranking MS-13 boyfriend, Jeffrey Amador, whose gang name was “Cruel”, that “four individuals took the train”, that they were “seeing the light” and “never coming back”. Escobar’s attorney, Keith White, said her comments were not evidence of guilt and that she did not know anyone would be killed at the park that night. “These are not confessions. These are pivots – pivots from a teenage girl who knew she was in danger,” White said. Elmer Alexander Artiaga-Ruiz, the lone survivor of the attack, testified that he escaped by running and jumping a fence after MS-13 gang members surrounded them. Artiaga-Ruiz, 22, had made the hand signs of MS-13 and its rival 18th Street gang in photos that he posted on social media, which Escobar saw and reported to the gang. Artiaga-Ruiz was not a gang member, prosecutors said, but a teenager also attempting to gain respect and attention. But the murders do shed light on MS-13 and other Central American gangs that have established themselves in parts of the US and reportedly in Europe. According to the US justice department, which describes combating MS-13 as a “top priority”, the group is a “complex phenomenon” that is “a social organization first, and a criminal organization second” and draws on a “complex notion of community”. “The gang is not about generating revenue as much as it is about creating a collective identity that is constructed and reinforced by shared, often criminal experiences, especially acts of violence and expressions of social control,” the report stated. Separately, in October last year, the department released “Full Scale Response: a Report on the Department’s Efforts to Combat MS-13 from 2016-2020”, which said it had prosecuted approximately 749 MS-13 gang members since 2016 using more than 20 federal criminal statutes, including terrorism charges. Notwithstanding MS-13’s tendency toward terrifying acts of violence, the separate political and criminal justice interpretations of the group presents an “enigma”, said David Pyrooz, a professor of sociology at the University of Colorado Boulder, who considers the Long Island murders as an outlier. “It’s very different to your typical drive-by or walk-up shooting, or spraying into a group of people. It’s personal. You use knives when it’s personal, guns when it’s impersonal,” he points out. “And that’s why it is attracting this level of attention.” Part of the anxiety around MS-13, Pyrooz said, is the role it plays in Central American countries, as form of criminal governance and its unusual transnational character. “Most gangs are indigenous to communities, and they don’t migrate,” he says. “But it’s important to remember that MS-13 are one of 30,000 gangs in the US, and their violence, though extreme, is a drop in the bucket of all the gang violence that occurs in the country.” Fears that MS-13 is involved in drug and people smuggling, though it may be in peripheral terms, is not its central business, which, like other gangs, is largely opportunistic. “They engage in a ‘cafeteria’ style of offending. They don’t really specialize – they commit property crimes, violent crimes, they do all types.” But what makes MS-13 stand out is its propensity for extreme violence. “It commands the attention of media and people like President Trump, because typical gang violence doesn’t involve hacking people up and beheadings,” Pyrooz said. “The imagery of the group has taken on this epic proportion that far outweighs the level of threat they pose to communities in general, though not in the communities where they are active.” By rational extension, that violence is self-protective in the sense that other gangs, or indeed law enforcement, will avoid confrontation. But it also comes with the potential for mimicry, in which other groups take on MS-13 symbolism and violent mannerisms because it could be protective. Which may be what the teens murdered on Long Island may, tragically, have been seeking to portray. But this, Pyrooz said, is not a message to the broader public. “It’s a message to their equals in age, race, ethnicity, gender and social status. MS-13 doesn’t get any benefit from targeting a 70-year-old grandmother. Perpetrators tend to be the social equal of the victims,” Pyrooz said. In fact, the public perception of gangs as a major law-enforcement threat are hard to pin down in reality. As gang activity has expanded throughout the country, emerging in the suburbs and even rural towns, US authorities actually have scant information about their range and effect. According to the most recent estimates from the National Gang Center, there are about 31,000 gangs and 850,000 gang members. But those figures date from 2012, when the taskforce was disbanded. Many of those outfits and members, though, are likely to be relatively dormant, and gang violence is almost exclusively within the communities in which they emerge. “Latino gangs fight other Latino gangs even in areas where it’s predominantly Black, and Black gangs fight other Black gangs in predominantly Latino areas,” Pyrooz said. Nor does the Hollywood trope of “once a gang member, always a gang member” stand up. The average length of membership may no more than two years and involves long periods of inactivity. As Malcolm Klein wrote in The American Street Gang: Its Nature, Prevalence, and Control: “For the most part, gang members do very little – sleep, get up late, hang around, brag a lot, eat again, drink, hang out some more. It’s a boring life.” Still, no other gang has obtained the elevated status of MS-13. Thanks to Trump’s comments, no other gang has been so etched in the memory of criminal justice and the general populace. “To get that call-out was so beneficial for the group’s reputation and status,” he said. “You’d have to go back to the Chicago outfit of Italian organized crime to see the level of attention that’s been afforded to them.”",News/US news,Trial over brutal killings sheds light on MS-13 and power of US street gangs,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/26/ms-13-gang-new-york-long-island-trial
3/26/2022,"After a long, bumpy awards season, the Oscars are finally tonight, and have come down to the worst fear of hand-wringing Hollywood traditionalists: for the first time, the two best picture frontrunners are from streaming platforms, while the traditional studio releases have all fallen behind. In the one corner: Netflix’s The Power of the Dog, Jane Campion’s elegant, sinuously queer western, which led the field with a whopping 12 nominations – though insider whispers suggest it’s more admired in the industry than it is adored. In the other, Apple’s Coda, a perky coming-of-ager about a hearing teen breaking away from her deaf family: there are few great claims to be made for it artistically, but it warms people’s hearts, and that’s seen it surge ahead in the American guild awards. While Netflix treated their auteur film like a gilded prestige item from its release in December, Apple, having released Coda online with limited fanfare last summer, saved all their campaign spending for far later in the game – it’s been around for longer, but it feels like many people are only just catching up, with accordingly noisy word of mouth. It all points to a change in the way we watch and share films going forward. Unusually, thanks to post-pandemic release models, almost all the best picture nominees can currently be watched from your couch. In addition to The Power of the Dog, of course, Netflix has Adam McKay’s bloated, gassy but occasionally amusing climate-change satire Don’t Look Up. Disney+ subscribers can check out Steven Spielberg’s swirlingly energetic West Side Story remake, before chasing its ebullience with the bitter noir shot of Guillermo del Toro’s handsomely savage Nightmare Alley remake. (Coda, too, is a remake, of the not-terribly-sacred French comedy La Famille Belier – fuel for anyone pushing the old “Hollywood has run out of ideas” line.) You can head to Amazon, Apple and the other standard VOD platforms to access Kenneth Branagh’s strangely trifling Troubles memoir, Belfast, Denis Villeneuve’s ravishing sci-fi starter Dune, and the enjoyably formulaic sports drama King Richard, with Will Smith’s charismatic, sure-to-be-rewarded star turn as tennis patriarch Richard Williams. Curzon Home Cinema has the best of the lot in Drive My Car, Ryûsuke Hamaguchi’s soul-nourishing reflection on grief, renewal and Chekhov: it’ll likely have to settle for the best international feature prize, but it’s a happy miracle to see it in the top category at all. Outside the best picture race, Disney+ also offers Jessica Chastain’s gaudy, skin-deep transformation into disgraced televangelist Tammy Faye Bakker in The Eyes of Tammy Faye; she’s the bookies’ favourite for best actress, but I’m crossing fingers for Netflix’s hopeful, Olivia Colman, in Maggie Gyllenhaal’s daring, layered, under-rewarded Elena Ferrante adaptation The Lost Daughter. Nicole Kidman will likely remain on the sidelines for her fascinatingly mannered Lucille Ball in Being the Ricardos – Amazon’s largely ignored prize pony, as the streaming giant fell rather behind Netflix and Apple this year. The documentary race, meanwhile, looks to be neck-and-neck between the rousing, crowd-pleasing archival dive Summer of Soul (Disney+) and the animated innovation and heart-tugging pull of refugee story Flee (Curzon). Finally, while the nominated short films haven’t been made available as a streaming package yet, Aneil Karia and Riz Ahmed’s wrenching post-Brexit nightmare The Long Goodbye is free to watch on Ahmed’s own YouTube channel, while Netflix has several to offer, including the slick, saccharine Aardman animation Robin Robin, and a trio of stirring documentary shorts: Audible, a deaf footballer portrait; Lead Me Home, a survey of America’s homelessness crisis; and Three Songs for Benazir, about a young Afghan man’s conflicting dreams of family life and national service. Two of my favourite nominated shorts are to be found elsewhere: the Short of the Week site has Alberto Mielgo’s animated conversation piece The Windshield Wiper, which mixes romantic ruminations with cutting-edge digital imagery, while Vimeo has Polish director Tadeusz Lysiak’s The Dress, a deeply affecting, unpatronising tale of a hotel maid with dwarfism on a lonely quest to lose her virginity. You could see it being expanded and remade into something far stickier and more sentimental: perhaps that’ll be an Oscar frontrunner in a few years’ time. Fresh(Disney+) Don’t let the Disney+ branding fool you into thinking this sleek, warped genre mashup is family friendly: this story of a Tinder-jaded young woman (Daisy Edgar-Jones) who takes a chance on an enigmatically seductive cosmetic surgeon (Sebastian Stan) blends provocatively grisly horror with romcom energy, with first-time director Mimi Cave taking a few cues from Emerald Fennell. Not all its sharp left turns pay off, but it delivers on its title’s promise. Lamb(Mubi)An Icelandic farming couple are stunned when one of their sheep births a most unusual lamb, which they proceed to raise on their own – with severely dark consequences. Narratively, there’s not a whole lot to Valdimar Jóhannsson’s film, but it blends folk horror with absurdist comedy to striking effect, with a lowering atmospheric chill that sinks into your bones. Hope(Picturehouse) Exquisitely acted and extraordinarily moving, Maria Sødahl’s marital drama got rather lost amid the flurry of awards-targeting prestige releases late last year: I hope people find it at home. An unsentimental, emotionally acute study of a couple revising the terms of their marriage in the wake of a terminal cancer diagnosis, it boasts two momentous performances from Stellan Skarsgård and Andrea Bræin Hovig. The Electrical Life of Louis Wain(Studiocanal)Shifting from canine power to feline charms, Benedict Cumberbatch gamely carries Will Sharpe’s hyper-stylised biopic of eccentric, cat-fixated artist Louis Wain. His performance is the grounding element of a film that all too often threatens to float away on a cloud of its own preciousness, but like Wain’s daffy art, some will have acquired its taste.",Arts/Film,Going for gold: where to stream the 2022 Oscar contenders,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/26/going-for-gold-where-to-stream-the-2022-oscar-contenders
3/26/2022,"Lily Dunn was six years old when her father left his wife and two young children, walking out of the family home in London, without any mention of when he would be back. He bought a one-way ticket to India, travelling to an ashram in Pune with a woman he met in a strip club, who wanted to introduce him to her guru, Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, also known as Osho. Sins of My Father has its roots in a memorable 2016 Granta essay, and has become a memoir of two lives: her father’s, rippled with grandiose drama, and her own attempts to harness the pain that he left in his restless wake. Dunn describes the severing of family ties as “this operatic rupture of flight”. This is a desperately sad story, but there is beauty in its crisp, cold clarity. Dunn’s father – named by initial, but then referred to as “Dad” or “my father”, which has a steadying effect, both intimate and distant – took to life in the Rajneesh cult, and much of this story is about his time as a devotee of the Bhagwan. He joined a great number of white, wealthy westerners whose search for enlightenment found a home in the Bhagwan’s teachings and communes. In 2018, the Netflix documentary series Wild Wild Country told the story of the cult’s move to Oregon in the United States, introducing its orange-clad sannyasins to a new generation. Dunn is not dismissive of the cult’s appeal, and is surprisingly empathetic towards its followers, considering the havoc it wrought upon her own life. But a cool anger emerges again and again. Her father, a writer and publisher, attempted to write his own spiritual text influenced by the Bhagwan; Dunn states that she can “barely tolerate this incoherent rubbish, the fuzz and evasiveness. Such careless words.” Her fury, powerful in its calm focus, is at its most pointed when describing the children who grew up under a “free love” decree that, at best, did little for their welfare and, at worst, enabled a culture of neglect and abuse. When Dunn is 13, she goes to stay with her father in Italy, and is groomed by a much older man. She turns to her father for advice, understandably distraught and confused about his appalling advances. Her father suggests she might learn something, only changing his mind “almost as a throwaway comment” when he realises the man has gonorrhoea. Sins of My Father is Dunn’s attempt to know her father, constantly on the move, impossible to rely on. “I was always so romantic about him,” she writes. This book is the de-romanticisation, and the cult is only one piece of a complex puzzle. She puts the rest of it together as if she is a detective working a long-forgotten cold case, and though its setting is very different, it reminded me of Laura Cummings’ gripping memoir, On Chapel Sands. Dunn speaks to family members, uncovers old letters and analyses family photographs to see what the expressions might be able to tell her now. She rifles through poetry and Shakespeare, studies Jung and Freud, and learns about trauma and addiction. She circles meditatively, from the end of his life back to the early stages of it, back and forth, adding another layer each time. During this painstaking process, she discovers terrible secrets about her father’s childhood, what happened during his periods of travel and success, and what led up to his death following a long period of alcoholism. The description of his decline is as vivid an account of addiction as I can remember reading. As Dunn seeks to understand her father, she is trying to understand herself. The subtitle, A Daughter, a Cult, a Wild Unravelling, makes it clear that she is claiming her place in the story. She writes that her brother eventually walks away from their father, cutting him off, in order to limit his own pain, but Dunn instead chooses to examine each tiny part of it. At times, this is bracing. I imagine many people would recoil from discovering the full, unvarnished story of their parents’ separation, for example, but there is a remarkably dispassionate observer’s eye throughout. It is dignified and respectful, which feels like an achievement in itself. Dunn never quite shakes the idealised image of her father as a damaged hero, but she does, eventually, shake herself free from the obligation to forgive him. Sins of My Father is a testament to the damage done, but it reads, in the end, like the slow discovery of freedom.  Sins of My Father: A Daughter, a Cult, a Wild Unravelling by Lily Dunn is published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson (£16.99). To support the Guardian and Observer order your copy at guardianbookshop.com.
