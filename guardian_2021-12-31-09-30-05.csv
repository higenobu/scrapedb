12/31/2021,"A sizzling heatwave across southern Australia will close out 2021, a year marked by severe storms and above-average rainfall that leaves large areas of the east exposed to flooding in the new year. After a mild start to summer, the mercury in Melbourne is forecast to climb to 38C on New Year’s Eve after topping 34C on Thursday. The first day of 2022 will be similarly hot, with the Bureau of Meteorology tipping 37C for the Victorian capital. Most other capitals will nudge 30C, or be close to it.  Adelaide is the other hot state capital, with 39C predicted for the final day of 2021 after 37.6C on Thursday and similar warmth forecast for Friday. The heatwave, which crested in Perth over Christmas, is the first extended hot spell for much of the country this summer. Perth metro just recorded 4 days in a row over 40 CSat 42.8CSun 43.5CMon 41.0CTues 40.7C (so far)This is the first time in December this has occurred and 3rd time everPrevious times were Feb 2016 and Feb 1933📷 T. Smith, South Cottesloe https://t.co/qLf9e7uf0E pic.twitter.com/mgE4JTlTR7 Many Australians, though, will remember 2021 – to the extent they ventured far from their locked-down or Covid-19 constrained homes – as one in which they needed to keep an umbrella handy. Coastal NSW, including Sydney, was pelted by multiple days of heavy rain in March. The week ending 24 March was the region’s wettest week in Bureau data going back to 1900. Four-day totals in some areas topped 900mm and the Hawkesbury-Nepean floodplain to Sydney’s north and west lived up its name. Less than three months later, it was Victoria’s turn to endure wild weather, with a complex low pressure system generating heavy rain and damaging winds that left as many as 200,000 people without electricity and toppled countless trees. More than 200mm of rain fell in west Gippsland catchment, resulting in major flooding. Other stormy highlights included a tornado that touched down near Bathurst in central western NSW in September. Major floods also swept down long rivers such as the Lachlan and Namoi, and filled the Menindee Lakes and other inland systems. As 2021 closes, regional NSW dams including Sydney’s are about 94% full, while Melbourne’s reservoirs are at 90% capacity. South-eastern Queensland, though, was one patch of eastern Australia that missed out on a lot of rain, with Brisbane’s Wivenhoe dam still under 50% full. In November, the Bureau declared a La Niña pattern had developed in the Pacific for a second year in row, a weather event that tends to favour above-average rainfall for northern and eastern Australia. As if on cue, Australia posted its wettest November on record, beating the previous November record set in 1973 with countrywide falls 124% above average. “Having two sequential La Niñas has particularly elevated the flood risk this spring and summer,” said Karl Braganza, the Bureau’s national manager of climate services. “When you have a really wet month leading into December, and into the monsoon season, that’s when we start to get worried about flooding from even moderate rainfall.” Meanwhile in the east, flood waters remain in northern NSWhttps://t.co/8pjsT2Hz5o pic.twitter.com/RIBUZUiBU4 The extra rainfall was influenced by other weather patterns, including a negative phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole. Such events typically cause increased convection off north-western Australia, resulting in additional moisture making its way across the continent to the country’s south-east. Good rains during the past two years have increased soil moisture levels, which tend to moderate heatwaves through evaporation. One consequence is that 2021 will have been relatively cool, at least compared with recent years. The background warming from climate change has pushed Australia’s temperatures up about 1.4 C since 1900, reducing the likelihood of cool years – 2020, for instance, was Australia’s fourth-hottest on record. This year, though, will probably fail to break into the top 10 for warmth even with the scorching end to the year, Braganza said. “It doesn’t tend to get as hot during La Niña years but you can have extended runs of hot weather,” he said. Some of that heat will be felt this week. For areas such as western Victoria, which have not shared in the above-average falls, the present heatwave will be enough to nudge bushfire risks higher. “Southern Australia is one of the most fire-prone regions of the world in any year,” Braganza adds. During La Niñas, strengthening equatorial winds result in the Pacific Ocean absorbing more heat from the atmosphere, whereas El Niños cause the ocean to give some of that warmth back. This year will probably be about the fifth or sixth warmest on record globally, climatologists expect. That would make it cooler than 2020 but warmer than any year prior to 2014 thanks to the effect of that warming temperature background. “It’s another really warm La Niña year,” Braganza said. One threat from that heating is that coral bleaching remains a risk for the Great Barrier Reef, as Guardian Australia reported earlier this month. “There’s a heightened risk of thermal stress on the Reef out to February,” he said, with a tropical cyclone the best chance of reducing that threat. The current La Niña is forecast to linger into early next year, raising the prospects for a relatively cool and damp start to 2022 for most of eastern Australia, the bureau predicts. For inland northern NSW and southern Queensland, that forecast points to ongoing flood risks. “The dams are spilling, and there was quite significant [recent] rainfall,” Braganza said. “So they’re going to be on a reasonable flood alert for the rest of summer.” Extensive bushfires near Perth in February and again in recent weeks hint at the ever-present challenge of fires in the Australia landscape. And while eastern states are likely to have a subdued season as far as forest fires go, the added rain over the past two years elevates potential risks in coming summers. “Of course, there’s vegetation growth,” Braganza said. “ And we know things can dry out quite quickly.”",News/Australia news,Year of storms and wild weather: New Year’s Eve heatwave hits after a sodden 2021 for much of Australia,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/31/year-of-storms-and-wild-weather-new-years-eve-heatwave-hits-after-a-sodden-2021-for-much-of-australia
12/31/2021,"João Cancelo suffered a violent attack at his home on Thursday evening, with the Manchester City defender left with visible facial injuries. He has branded the four intruders as “cowards”.  While the incident is being investigated by the police, Cancelo’s ability to travel with Pep Guardiola’s squad for Saturday’s match against Arsenal is in doubt. The 27-year-old posted a picture of himself on his personal Instagram account in which he was shown to be cut above the right eye and bruised. In the post, Cancelo said: “Unfortunately today I was assaulted by four cowards who hurt me and tried to hurt my family. “When you show resistance this is what happens. I don’t know how there are people with such meanness. The most important thing for me is my family and luckily they are all OK. After so many obstacles in my life this is just one more that I will overcome. Firm and strong, like always.” Full statement from Joao Cancelo: pic.twitter.com/v3MW6szUwo It is understood that City staff were at Cancelo’s home on Thursday evening to support him and his family. A decision regarding whether Cancelo can travel to London to face Arsenal is to be taken some time on Friday. A City statement said: “We are shocked and appalled that Joao Cancelo and his family were subjected to a burglary at their home this evening during which Joao was also assaulted. Joao and his family are being supported by the club and he is helping the police with their enquiries as they investigate this very serious matter.”",Sport/Football,Manchester City’s João Cancelo assaulted at home during robbery,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/31/manchester-citys-joao-cancelo-assaulted-at-home-during-robbery
12/31/2021,"With Omicron surging around Australia, there’s good reason to veg out at home in front of the TV this New Year’s Eve and observe the outside world through this medium we call television. One day in the future, plugged into the metaverse, we’ll be astral projecting between virtual fireworks displays while high-fiving our digitally recreated long-dead ancestors, but for now we are still absorbing entertainment via moving images displayed on flat screens. The humble old teev offers various ways to count down the new year – including fireworks displays, recaps and movies.  The Omicron variant of Covid-19 has caused many fireworks displays to be cancelled around the world, including one in Melbourne that would’ve involved more than 350 drones – which may or may not have become sentient mid-performance and decided to rise up against their human overlords. You never know, maybe we dodged a bullet. Many displays are still going ahead, continuing that great human tradition of creating colour and spectacle by making stuff explode in the sky. The ABC will be broadcasting several of them, including the Sydney fireworks at 9pm AEDT for those who can’t be bothered making it to midnight. ABC’s pre-fireworks shebang kicks off at 8.30pm with The Early Night Show, co-hosted by the charismatic actor Hunter Page-Lochard, who played the titular character in ABC TV’s Cleverman and most recently co-starred in Fires. From 9.15pm, the ABC is broadcasting its NYE2021: Let’s Celebrate! concert at Sydney Opera House, hosted by Charlie Pickering, Zan Rowe and Jeremy Fernandez. Performers include Tina Arena, Missy Higgins, Casey Donovan and Genesis Owusu, taking you up to the countdown to midnight and more fireworks over Sydney harbour. Alternatively, viewers in Victoria can tune into Channel Nine to watch City Of Melbourne: New Year’s Eve 2021, which starts at 11pm and is hosted by Catriona Rowntree and Clint Stanaway. I appreciate the “yearly recap” format – it reminds me of high school exam cheat sheets. My wife verbally summarised the appeal of the format when, while watching The Yearly With Charlie Pickering 2021, she said “oh yeah, that’s right!” at least three times. Pickering’s special this year contains several laugh-out-loud moments but, obviously filmed pre-Omicron, already looks dated, with Pickering appearing near the beginning of the show sitting in a fairly crowded (albeit masked-up) studio. Funny moments include a segment called the Real Premiers of Australia, which recaps the argy-bargy exchanged between Australian premiers as if it were a reality TV program. For a more international perspective, Netflix has its very funny Death to 2021 special, a sequel to Death to 2020. For snappier recaps, there’s Jimmy Fallon’s compilation of his “news smash” segments, this six-minute rewind of the year from Vox, and – shorter still – a two and a half minute Reddit-produced video, which is set to an annoying upbeat ditty but, to its credit, begins with vision of geese wearing sombreros. But, I hear you asking – nay, demanding – what about articles listing the very best Australian films and TV shows of the year? Here are a couple I prepared earlier: my lists of the best homegrown productions for both the big and small screen, featuring many hours of quality viewing. The perfect film to watch during NYE is something with a bit of a party vibe, or at least something that isn’t a total downer – so, no Lars von Trier films allowed. On ABC iView there’s Firestarter: The Story Of Bangarra, a terrific documentary (No 4 on my list of the best Australian films of the year) about the history of the amazing Bangarra Dance Theatre, which has been staging sumptuous visual and musical performances for decades. Nine is screening Dirty Dancing at 8:30pm, fondly remembered as one of the pedigree dance-themed flicks of the 80s – the crop top-wearing, leg-flailing domain of Flashdance, Footloose, Fame, and (my favourite of the bunch) Breakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo. For good family fun, NITV is screening Taika Waititi’s 2016 comedy Hunt for the Wilderpeople from 7.30pm. Elsewhere, SBS is showing The Blues Brothers at 9:25pm, The Full Monty is airing on Seven from 11pm and 9Gem is screening Ben Hur from 8.30pm – with a running time of three and a half hours, it’ll take up a good chunk of the night and get you over the finish line into 2022. Those hankering for a blockbuster spectacle can tee up the handsomely cinematic Godzilla vs Kong, which recently landed on Netflix. And if you haven’t seen the excellent Danish comedy/drama Another Round, check it out on SBS on Demand. . Adelaide Oval might be the most handsome sporting arena in the world and it showcases a sunset like nowhere else in Australia. So before the sky lights up with fireworks, why not check out the Adelaide Strikers against the Sydney Thunder in the Big Bash League and the many cutaways to the multicoloured gloaming? It’s screening at 7:15pm AEDT on Channel Seven, Kayo and Foxtel. – Jonathan Howcroft",Arts/Television & radio,Spending New Year’s Eve at home?

12/31/2021,"Two fast-moving wildfires driven by strong winds erupted in northern Colorado on Thursday afternoon, forcing thousands of residents to flee their homes. The fires, burning to the north and south of the city of Boulder, were fanned by gusts of up to 110 mph that whipped flames and smoke into a frenzy..  The Colorado governor Jared Polis has declared a state of emergency, freeing up disaster emergency funds and providing other resources to aid in the response. “Prayers for thousands of families evacuating from the fires in Superior and Boulder county,” Polis said on Twitter. “Fast winds are spreading flames quickly and all aircraft are grounded.” Brother just sent this from #superior near or along Mccaslin Blvd I believe. #boulder #louisville @NWSBoulder @ai6yrham #marshallfire pic.twitter.com/T2Sml4ChEA Mandatory evacuations were issued Thursday afternoon for the 34,000 people who live in the towns of Superior and Louisville, in Boulder county, as giant black and grey plumes engulfed the residential and commercial areas. Residents in an area of Broomfield were also told to begin preparing to leave. “Life threatening situation in Superior and Louisville areas!” tweeted the National Weather Service in Boulder, alerting locals to gather their things and leave immediately. “Fast moving fires are in the area.” Videos posted to social media showed apocalyptic scenes. In one recorded by a shopper evacuating a Costco, throngs of customers are seen rushing outside into a windy parking lot clouded with dense smoke. Local news cameras captured scenes from a distance, showing black and grey plumes whipping through browned hillsides above lines of gridlocked cars inching toward escape.

Several structures have been spotted ablaze by reporters and residents on the scene but officials have not yet issued reports on damage or buildings under threat. Six people have been admitted to the hospital with fire-related-injuries, according to local reports. Strong winds, which downed power lines and overturned big-rigs in the area, are expected to continue into the evening, according to the National Weather Service. With gusts of roughly 80 mph. More than 24,000 people lost power during the windstorm, limiting some from being able to open their garage doors while trying to evacuate. An evacuation center also had to be relocated after the original location lost power. This photo was taken by one of our patrol officers in the parking lot of the Panda Express in Superior.

Between August and December, the Boulder area received only 1.6in of precipitation, far below its 6.8in average for the same time period. “Genuinely hard to believe this is happening in late December in Boulder, CO,” climate scientist Daniel Swain wrote on Twitter. “But take a record warm & dry fall, only 1 inch of snow so far this season, & add an extreme (100mph+) downslope windstorm ... and extremely fast moving/dangerous fires are the result.” Saying he was at a loss for words, Swain described hearing explosions as homes and ranch buildings went up in flames nearby.

12/31/2021,"Humpback whales are becoming an increasingly common sight off the coast of Britain, according to a marine review of 2021, but dumped fishing gear is causing a rising number of stranded seals and dolphins. Walruses, pufferfish and furrowed crabs were among the marine creatures from far-flung places that visited the UK and Ireland this year due to the climate crisis, according to the Wildlife Trusts, while puffins returned to the Isle of Man for the first time in 30 years after a rat eradication programme.  White-beaked dolphins were seen off Essex for the first time in more than two decades and native oyster populations have been re-established in Yorkshire, Essex and Northern Ireland after years of overfishing, pollution and disease. Sand lizards have been successfully reintroduced to Lancashire’s dunes. Conservationists said that 2021 had been a positive year for marine ecosystems around the British Isles, with schemes launched to restore seagrass meadows and huge kelp forests, which provide shelter for wildlife, including two species of seahorse. But a rise in cetacean strandings signalled trouble at sea. In Cornwall, more than 170 whales, dolphins and porpoises were stranded this year along with 247 seals, many injured due to fishing activity. Lissa Batey, head of marine conservation for the Wildlife Trusts, said: “It’s been a fantastic year for marine megafauna sightings, particularly in the south-west, but it’s clear that our oceans are under immense pressure from fishing, development, pollution, climate change and recreation. All these issues are having a huge impact on life at sea.” In Cornwall, a humpback whale was found stranded off Looe Island after being caught in fishing lines, while seven grey seals washed up on Mousehole beach within two days, linked with spider crab netting. Despite the strandings, significant numbers of humpback whales were spotted around the coast, once an extremely rare sight. More than 75 sightings have been recorded since 2019, a sign that populations are recovering after bans on commercial whaling, according to conservationists. The Isles of Scilly Wildlife Trust saw humpbacks feeding around the islands with one individual, named Pi, staying for more than two months. More were seen in the Firth of Forth and off Shetland. Matt Slater, marine conservation officer for Cornwall Wildlife Trusts, said: “Only a few years ago, it would have been extremely rare to see a humpback whale around the UK. But it looks like they are chasing big shoals of sardines that are now present around our shores. It is magnificent to see these creatures up close.” In 2021, an Arctic walrus nicknamed Wally was seen around the coast of the UK, often spotted lying on boats, perhaps driven by melting sea ice in the polar north. A second walrus was seen off Northumberland and around Shetland. In October, a pufferfish washed up in Cornwall for the first time in 20 years, a species rarely found this far north. The Wildlife Trusts also warned there had been a rise in human disturbances of marine animals, with three times as many incidents since 2014. An increase in jet skis and motorboats is a leading cause for concern. This year, the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales witnessed a seal pup being abandoned by its mother after people were seen taking selfies with the pup. Dr Emily Baxter, senior marine conservation officer at North West Wildlife Trusts, said: “We’ve got amazing marine life in the UK and we’ve had some fantastic sightings this year, from sort of dancing sea slugs in Cumbria to puffins coming back. It’s important to remind people that actually, they don’t necessarily need to travel to far-flung places to see amazing marine life.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,Whales and pufferfish among ‘amazing marine life’ to visit Britain in 2021,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/31/whales-pufferfish-amazing-marine-life-britain-2021-aoe
12/31/2021,"Every adult in England has now been offered a Covid booster jab, the government has announced . At the beginning of December, Boris Johnson warned in a televised speech that the UK was “facing an emergency in our battle with the new variant, Omicron”.  The prime minister said all adults in England would be offered a booster jab by the end of the year, adding that he was launching a “national mission” to achieve that. The target date had previously been the end of January. Johnson’s announcement came after evidence showed that having two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine does not provide strong protection against Omicron. However, a third dose provides about 70% protection against symptomatic infection. On Friday, the health secretary, Sajid Javid, said the booster drive meant that “tens of millions of people” got to see “loved ones this Christmas”. He added that he was “incredibly proud” of the work the NHS had done to accelerate the programme, and thanked “the frontline staff, volunteers, armed forces and British public who have made it possible for us to meet this commitment”. More than 3,000 vaccination sites have been opened in England, with 180 new ones in December at football stadiums, shopping centres and Christmas markets. People have received letters and text messages inviting them to book booster vaccination appointments. Official data shows that more than 8m booster doses were administered in England – a 45% increase – in the period between 12 December and 30 December. The highest daily number of Covid booster jabs in England – 830,403 – took place on 18 December. More than 28.1 million people in England have now had their booster, including about 90% of those aged 50 and over who are eligible. This week, more than 1.5 million appointments were still available between 27 December and 3 January for anyone yet to get a top-up shot. The vaccines minister, Maggie Throup, said: “We have now offered all eligible adults in England a Covid-19 booster – a triumph for the NHS and the vaccination programme. “It’s never been easier to get your vaccine, with over 3,000 vaccination sites now open – so you can grab a jab in between shopping the January sales or watching your favourite football team play.”",News/Society,"Covid booster jab offered to all adults in England, says government",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/31/covid-booster-jab-offered-to-all-adults-in-england-says-government
12/31/2021,"Normally the summer Olympics are the pinnacle event for me to cover, but this year was not at all normal and I decided to give Tokyo a miss. Not only did my family not want me going, there were other factors to discourage me, not least the new rules that meant I might have very limited access. So instead my year was dominated by football, the peak being the final of the Euros at Wembley, a game that brought the country to a standstill and became one of the most-watched moments in British television history.  44mm lens 1/1600 f4.5 ISO 4000 My year started off in a very cold fashion with a trip to the Hawthorns, the highest professional league ground in the country. Despite the freezing conditions I loved it. It is pretty rare to shoot a football match in snow, thanks to either modern heated pitches melting it, or the games getting called off due to safety concerns for spectators. Back in January that obviously wasn’t the case as all games were being played behind closed doors. It was quickly apparent that the home side probably wished it had been postponed. They lost 4-0 to Arsenal, a dismal performance indicative of their season as a whole. The reason I like this picture is the bleakness of it all. Heavy snow falling in an empty stadium as all 10 outfield West Brom players, each one separate from the other, trudge back to the centre circle after conceding a goal. A very black and white image – perhaps a Christmas card for a Wolves fan? 400mm lens 1/2500 f4 ISO 640 In mid-January this special challenge match was the only senior men’s rugby game in Britain as all the others had been cancelled for Covid reasons. Ealing are a Championship team, in the second tier of English rugby, and Saracens were just about to start their season at this new level following their demotion from the Premiership. Most rugby matches I usually cover are in large stadia with tall stands circling the pitch. This wasn’t the case at Ealing and most of the pitch was bathed in low winter sun. Shooting backlit was beautiful, all I needed was the play to come near me into the right patch of light. For ages it seemed stuck at the other end, time ticking by and the sun rapidly descending. Eventually a maul formed where I needed it and I managed to get a few frames before clouds rolled in and everything went dark. 560mm lens, 1/1600 f4 ISO 4000 It was injury time at the end of this very dull 0-0 draw back in January. I was cold and had very few decent pictures. Suddenly the Arsenal striker Alexandre Lacazette launched himself at the ball across the back of Harry Maguire and flipped over in mid-air. It just goes to show you never know when something might happen to brighten up your day. 105mm lens 1/1250 f4.5 ISO 4000 One of the advantages of working in an empty stadium with a game played behind closed doors is that it gave me opportunities to put remote cameras in places I normally wouldn’t be allowed to, such as here in the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, on stairs right at the top of the massive South Stand. While I was down at pitch-level, I was setting off this camera up there. I love the view looking down on the goal, all neat symmetry and perfect lines. Even the groundsman with rubber gloves on, ready to pick up a loose ball from behind the goal, is standing right in the middle. As Jorginho stepped up to score a penalty for Chelsea, the only goal of this game, all the elements lined up perfectly. This frame is also a reminder of the pandemic age of football, a time when the game carried on without fans. 560mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 2500 The England captain Owen Farrell gets a fist in the face during his side’s 41-18 victory over Italy in the Six Nations. International rugby is such a hard, physical sport with a lot of close confrontations such as this. It is at moments like these that I often like to go in tight on the action with a very long lens. Sometimes it pays off, sometimes it does not. 145mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 3200 Normally for this game, which has always been one of my favourite fixtures, the Principality Stadium would be full of baying red-shirted fans. It is a perfect ground for rugby which, when full, crackles with intensity and passion. The Six Nations game there in February felt very surreal, the empty seats covered with giant waterproof sheets, one of which bore a fire-breathing dragon. I could not help but imagine what the noise would have been like as Wales won 40-24. 50mm lens 1/125 f1.6 ISO 400 In 2012 Lawrence Okolie weighed 19 stone and was working in a McDonald’s at London Victoria station. It was the final day of the London Olympics and in a break from flipping burgers he watched Anthony Joshua winning the heavyweight boxing gold medal on TV. The following day Okolie quit his job and vowed to be a boxer. In early April I went to photograph the 28-year-old from Hackney just a few days after he became the WBO world cruiserweight champion. I decided to photograph Okolie in the tiny gym at the bottom of his garden in Essex, cradling his newly-won world champion belt. 28mm lens 1/2500 f11 ISO 1250 In the hour before every Grand National there is always a buzz among the photographers at the course. Everyone asks “where are you going?” or “what’s your plan?” This year was no different and I remember talking to Steve Cargill, a racing specialist, as we headed out on to the track. In unison we both said: “What if Rachael wins?” and realised our goals were very similar, we had to be at the finish in case Blackmore created history and became the first female jockey to win the world’s most famous steeplechase race. I had photographed her success at Cheltenham the previous month, where she was crowned leading jockey, so knew she was in terrific form. Sure enough her horse, Minella Times, carried her to victory at Aintree. It was a real pity that spectators were not there to witness it, just a few owners watching on. It was quite eerie afterwards as she enjoyed the moment while at the same time caring for her horse, dousing it with water while the TV screen replayed her historic win in the background. 70mm lens 1/2000 f4.5 ISO 500 For a couple of weeks of the Premier League season in April and May it seemed the news agenda was not being set by matters on the pitch but rather what was occurring outside grounds. It was the time of fans’ protests, justifiably angered by six clubs announcing their intention to join a new European Super League. This radical proposal, which would have caused havoc to the game, came along when fans had been locked out for months. At Arsenal the fans’ grievances were directed squarely at the club’s owner, Stan Kroenke. Before a home match against Everton hundreds gathered. I went back inside the ground after photographing the demo. The game, in front of no fans, was desperate. Arsenal lost 1-0 but no one seemed that bothered with the result – the bigger news had been made outside. 16mm lens 1/400 f4 ISO 3200 Once I saw Caglar Soyuncu scoring the winner for Leicester at Old Trafford, I knew the most important pictures on that May evening would be taken on the other side of Manchester. United’s defeat meant City had won the Premier League. So I quickly got in the car after the final whistle and headed over to the Etihad. Sure enough hundreds of City fans descended on their ground to celebrate the title victory. One of them, pictured here, played up beautifully for the cameras, holding a can of lager and a flare in one hand, while smoking a rollup in the other. 840mm lens 1/1600 f5.6 ISO 800 There are times in Test cricket that are, let us just say, not quite as interesting as others. The third day of the first Test had been wiped out by rain, and the match was meandering towards a draw on the fourth afternoon. My mind started to wander. I had noticed, unusually for Lords, that quite a few pigeons had been pecking away at the square. This sort of bird activity I have always associated with the Oval. Anyway, I thought I would try to create a picture with them. Slowly a number started to congregate on a patch not far from the wicket being used. Kane Williamson, the New Zealand captain, played a shot then shouted for a run. The pigeons took off in unison, all apart from one, who stubbornly stayed put. 115mm lens 1/1250 f7.1 ISO 800 When the England players came out at Lord’s for the national anthems before the first Test in early June, they all wore black t-shirts with slogans on the back. It was a moment, designed by the ECB, as a show of unity with people of all backgrounds. These slogans mentioned ageism, ableism, transphobia, homophobia and religious intolerance. I decided for the second Test in Edgbaston to try to show the players wearing these t-shirts together so I went up to the TV gantry to shoot down on to the backs of the England team. It was only after taking the picture that I realised something was missing – why no mention of racism on any of the shirts? Then, just a few months later, the story of Azeem Rafiq and his treatment at Yorkshire made the headlines and I could not help but think back to this picture. 23mm lens 1/1600 f4.5 ISO 2000 Raheem Sterling scores the first goal for England against Germany in their knockout match at the Euros. It may have been less than half-full but I cannot recall Wembley ever sounding louder than at that moment. For all the matches at Wembley during the Euros, only 16 photographers were allowed pitchside due to Covid regulations and I felt very privileged to be there. However, rules that had prevented us from putting remote cameras right next to the net had been relaxed. It was great to be back shooting pictures such as this, after a Premier League season where these sort of cameras had been banished to behind the advertising boards. 400mm lens 1/1600 f3.5 ISO 4000 I wish I had been there in New York when Emma shocked the sporting world by winning the US Open. This image, taken at Wimbledon in July, is not a nice picture and I did not like taking it but sometimes you have to photograph what is the story of the day. The reason I am including it in this selection is to show what an amazing transformation Raducanu had in just a few months. From breathing problems and having to withdraw from her last-16 match at Wimbledon to winning the US Open as a qualifier without losing a set – remarkable. 400mm lens 1/2000 f4 ISO 4000 The England manager, Gareth Southgate, consoles Bukayo Saka after missing the final penalty in the shootout, handing Italy the Euros title. When I look back at this picture now it stirs up so many feelings, mainly of sadness, but also of pride and hope for the future. When I am actually at a game like this, I deliberately try to divorce myself from too much emotion. This is easier said than done but somehow putting a camera in front of my face helps keep my equilibrium and gets me to focus on what needs to be done. In this case it was to show the heartbreak for England as they missed out on winning a first title in 55 years. Once I saw Saka miss and then wander back towards the centre circle I stayed focused on him, ignoring the Italian celebrations. The 19-year-old buckled into the arms of his manager, burying his head deep into Southgate’s shoulder. For one split moment their legs matched each other, united in their despair. The symbolism struck me immediately. Southgate, having missed a decisive penalty for England at Wembley in the 1996 Euros, knew exactly the anguish Saka was going through. He seemed to wrap his arms round the player in a protective manner knowing exactly the sort of abuse that was heading the young player’s way. 61mm lens 1/2000 f22 ISO 320 It had been 10 years since I had photographed The Open. This picture was one I definitely could not have taken in 2011. Thanks to my current cameras having a silent function, I can now take pictures during the swing whereas a decade ago, without a silent shutter, that was forbidden. Now I can be up close to the player, just a few feet away in this case, and fire the shutter at any time. Royal St George’s was quite hard work for pictures this year, but one thing was in the photographer’s favour – the beautifully sunny weather. As Sandwich is the southernmost venue on the Open roster it also meant the sun set earlier than those courses in Scotland or northern England. This enabled me to get pictures such as this, as Morikawa, on his way to winning the title, teed off at the 18th on Saturday evening with the low sun sat perfectly behind him. With my shutter firing throughout his swing I manage to capture the beautiful bend of the club just before he hit the ball. 41mm lens 1/2500 f 5.6 ISO 400 The classic view of this ground for photographers has always been across the pitch to the gas holders behind but, due to building work both inside and outside The Oval, that is no longer possible. However a very different view has now opened up, one from high on top the new M.A.R. Galadari stand. It is spectacular up there, a bird’s eye view of the pitch with the cluster of skyscrapers in the Vauxhall development shooting upwards. This image shows a small boy in Indian team kit as he peers over a wall, intent on watching every little moment of play, seemingly oblivious to the backdrop. 168mm lens 1/2000 f4 ISO 800 Manchester United’s home game against Newcastle in September was about one man. T-shirts for sale outside the ground proclaimed this match as “The Second Coming of CR7”. It seemed a foregone conclusion that once Freddie Woodman, the Newcastle keeper, had spilled a shot just before half-time, you-know-who would be there to pounce on the rebound. One swing of the golden-studded boot and, 12 years after scoring his previous goal for Manchester United at Old Trafford, Cristiano Ronaldo had scored again. 155mm lens 1/500 f2.8 ISO 6400 As he walked out of the tunnel to defend his world heavyweight titles against Oleksandr Usyk, Joshua turned around to adoring fans and tapped his glove on his heart. Looking uncannily like Muhammad Ali in his pristine white gown, the British boxer seemed confident and relaxed, soaking up adulation from the phone-wafting spectators. They were all in for a very uncomfortable night as Usyk defeated a lacklustre Joshua. Even though there is hardly any light where this photo is taken, what is there is very soft, a perfect balance from tunnel, television and phone. 300mm lens 1/640th f2.8 ISO 6400 This marathon has always been one of my favourite events to cover. After last year’s elite-only race, it was great to see 40,000 runners on the capital’s streets again. Instead of going to the finish or one of the famous landmarks, I decided to do something a little different, going to a location that is very unglamorous but notorious for being incredibly hard. Just about at the 24-mile marker, where the dreaded “wall” often kicks in, are a series of tunnels under railway stations. These can produce dramatic variations in light and in this picture, of the leaders in the elite men’s race, I exposed for the dark conditions just as the runners entered the tunnel. Normally photographers like a dark background to show off the action but in this case it’s the opposite. Outside the tunnel went white, producing this very graphic and unusual athletics image. 24mm lens 1/3200 f7.1 ISO 1000 For the first time in two years, the NFL was back in London as the Falcons hosted the Jets. One aspect of the sport I like, and which often makes good pictures, is the way the home team are announced and they run out to a big fanfare, often through fireworks. I positioned myself in the corner from where the Falcons players would emerge. The obligatory dry ice started to pump all around me (quite a weird feeling) and then just before the big moment, the sun popped out from behind a cloud. Rather than shooting with the players running towards me, I spun round and shot them backlit, dashing away from me through the swirling smoke. 50mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 400 In early October the writer Simon Hattenstone and I went to Frankie Dettori’s house near Newmarket to do an interview that was timed for the release of his new book, Leap of Faith. I have photographed Dettori winning countless big races over the years and to see his trademark flying dismount off the most powerful of horses has always been a tremendous thrill. Before the shoot I asked Dettori to change into riding gear, so fair play to him for putting on the colours he wore to such great success on his favourite horse, Enable. After doing a few formal portraits just to warm him up, I steered him round to a paddock where I knew he had a couple of miniature donkeys called Pip and Plum. Well it had to be done. I asked him to pop on to Plum’s back and he obliged. Plum wasn’t having any of it and off Frankie came, stumbling as he exited. We all cracked up with laughter. From now on I don’t think I will ever watch his flying dismount the same way again. 35mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 3200 This was a pretty momentous day for Newcastle as they played their first game under their new Saudi owners. St James’ Park was buzzing with fans’ hope and anticipation. I was positioned in front of the Gallowgate End, Newcastle’s traditional home end, where almost everyone wears black and white. For the first few minutes of the game, and as the ball was at the other end of the pitch, I turned round and focused on a fan in the front row, decked out in a headscarf. Then Newcastle scored. The place erupted, a sense that all those years of despair had been left behind and here was a different Newcastle. What I like about this picture is not only the expressions of joy but also the one fan in the bottom right corner of the frame, a wry smile just about appearing on his face. Maybe he knew not to get too excited. Spurs went on to win the game 3-2. 400mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 4000 As the final whistle blew just moments after he had kicked a last ditch penalty, England’s new rugby union superstar celebrated beating the world champion Springboks. Marcus Smith was the figurehead for a much-changed England team this autumn. They emerged from a desperately poor Six Nations campaign earlier in the year to beat Tonga, Australia and South Africa in consecutive weeks. I am looking forward to seeing a lot more of Smith in the coming years. Not just for his inspired play but also because his hair flying everywhere makes for great pictures. Twickenham is a great place for shooting rugby, especially under lights. The backgrounds go nicely dark and because the crowd is so far back, the players stand out even more. 85mm lens 1/1600 f1.8 ISO 400 In early December I went to Cheltenham to shoot a portrait of the England football legend and the only man to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final. It was Hurst’s 80th birthday just a few days later and Donald McRae had conducted a poignant interview with him that had revealed some of the tragedies and hard times he had suffered alongside his many achievements. It turned out to be a rather bizarre photo session in a local park near Hurst’s home. The first thing he said to me, after seeing my various bags of kit, was “You going on holiday? This is just a quick snap isn’t it.” He quickly warmed up after chatting about how he did Joe Wicks’ workouts in this very park. I took him past the swings and on to a spot near a duck pond, an area I thought would be a bit quieter. It was not. A constant stream of dog walkers passed by quizzically looking at us. Eventually one stopped and asked Hurst: “You seen George and the kids today?” He turned to her and replied: “No. He may have flown over with them to the other pond.” Our national hero then proceeded to have a chat with this woman about the whereabouts of the park’s resident swan and its cygnets. I am sure she had absolutely no idea who he was. Hurst also told me that a few days earlier another woman came up to him and said: “I know who you are. You’re Glenn Hoddle,” to which Geoff said “Yes I am” and walked off. 24mm lens 1/1250 f2.8 ISO 4000 What makes someone in their seventies travel right across the world in the middle of a pandemic to race their bike through mud and freezing rain? When I saw the 2021 UCI World Masters Cyclo-Cross Championships were being held in East Anglia, I could not resist having a look. The conditions were pretty grim, very dark and overcast, but it could have been a lot worse. It has been many years since I photographed cyclo-cross and I had forgotten what a brilliant but tough sport it is. I came away with the utmost respect for all the competitors even if I thought they were slightly mad. 200mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 2000 It was late in this hotly contested London derby, the two teams level at 2-2, when the West Ham left-back Arthur Masuaku swung an intended cross into the Chelsea penalty box. Somehow the mishit swerved in the air, deceiving the goalkeeper Édouard Mendy, who dived in despair. The ball flew into the top corner of the net. West Ham had won and their push to the top four of the Premier League had continued.",Sport/Sport,Tom Jenkins’s best sports photos of 2021,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/31/tom-jenkinss-best-sports-photos-of-2021
12/31/2021,"Britain is in an “incomparably better” position in the fight against Covid than it was at the end of 2020, Boris Johnson has said in his new year’s message, while Keir Starmer stressed his belief in a brighter future but said the virus remained a real threat. Both party leaders focused on the effect the pandemic had had on the country in their messages. The prime minister admitted there was anxiety about the Omicron variant and growing numbers of hospital admissions, and urged those who had not been vaccinated to get their jabs.  There was “one overriding reason” that tougher restrictions were not needed in the face of daily case numbers hitting record levels, he said – people “heroically, voluntarily and in almost incredible numbers heeding the call to get vaccinated”. Johnson was buoyant about the speed of the booster rollout, saying it was “precisely because of that huge national effort that we can celebrate tonight at all”. He still urged everyone in England to be cautious, take a test if going out and remember the importance of ventilation, and he told those in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland – who face tougher measures – that they should follow the respective rules in force across each nation. He also called people who were still unvaccinated or unboosted to get their jabs. “Look at the intensive care units and the miserable, needless suffering of those who did not get their booster. That could be you,” he said. “So, make it your new year’s resolution – far easier than losing weight or keeping a diary – find a walk-in centre or make an online appointment.” The Labour leader also called on people to “make the right choices, to come together” and forge a new sense of direction that he said would lead to a brighter future. Buoyed by a boost in the polls while the Conservatives’ vaccine bounce diminished, Starmer promised to set out “the ideas that I believe can build a new Britain” over the next 12 months. “Given the last two years our country has been through it would be all too easy to lose heart. But, like you, I believe in Britain. I believe the best still lies ahead for Britain,” he said. “That – if we make the right choices – together we can seize the future and make it work for every family in every part of Britain. That must be the true legacy of all the sacrifices and pain of the past two years of the pandemic.” Patriotism was not enough for success, he said, stressing the UK needed a leader who “can translate that pride into the action we need”. He said the events he was most looking forward to next year included the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, the Queen’s platinum jubilee and – as a football lover – the World Cup. The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, used his new year message to stress he hoped 2022 would be “the year we will finally beat Covid” – but said it would begin with “many worries”. He said a potential “cost of living crisis” was already brewing, with heating bills on the rise and the threat of inflation, a “staff shortage crisis” with people off work isolating and a “political crisis” with the government divided and distracted at a crucial point in the pandemic.",News/World news,PM says UK doing ‘incomparably better’ against Covid in new year message,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/31/pm-says-uk-doing-incomparably-better-against-covid-in-new-year-message
12/31/2021,"Ralf Rangnick has revealed he warned his players about their body language following Monday’s insipid draw at Newcastle and was satisfied with the response as Manchester United saw off Burnley 3-1. United drew criticism for visible shows of petulance and a lack of togetherness during the 1-1 result at St James’ Park.  The interim manager was clear this had to stop. “In team sports it is always important you are convinced about what you are doing,” said Rangnick. “At Newcastle it was a difficult game for us, we were 1-0 down after seven minutes. They did well, we didn’t play well, especially in the first half. Therefore the reaction to what is happening on the pitch is the question. How do we react to this? Do we fight back, show them we are a team that believes in themselves, or do we shake our heads and wave our arms and help the other team and damage our own team? “For me it was clear to tell them it is important we work and behave as a team and don’t show these kinds of side-effects on the pitch.” Scott McTominay, who scored Thursday’s opener against Burnley and impressed throughout, admitted Rangnick was right to offer the warning. “Body language is one thing and the manager has come in and said he wants to cut that out, so that is final. We have taken it on board,” said the midfielder. A further strike from Cristiano Ronaldo plus Ben Mee’s own goal were answered only by Aaron Lennon, all goals coming before the break. This was Rangnick’s fifth game in charge and he praised his side’s attack. “I would say yes [our best display],” he said. “But whenever the ball was in our half there was still some space for improvement [defensively] but offensively I agree that was our best performance.” McTominay had been a doubt due to a leg problem. “We only decided this afternoon at two o’clock that he would play as he had some problems with the ankle contusion he suffered at Newcastle,” said Rangnick. “So it was good to have him available and in the team.” Jorge Mendes, Ronaldo’s agent, claimed the forward is content at United, following rumours of unrest. “Cristiano Ronaldo is very happy at Manchester United,” he told Sky Sports. “He’s going to continue with his solid, great performances as always in his career. It’s going to be a great season for him, I’m sure”.",Sport/Football,Ralf Rangnick happy with reaction after warning players over body language,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/30/ralf-rangnick-happy-with-reaction-after-warning-players-over-body-language
