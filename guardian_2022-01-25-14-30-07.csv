1/25/2022,"As Transparency International (TI) publishes their annual Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) this week, it will be interesting to see where certain countries land: 2021 has been a bumper year for corruption. In Britain, corruption has been on the minds of journalists, academics and practitioners alike, as Boris Johnson tries to get himself run out, the only hope of him continuing his innings lying with Sue Gray.  However, in the ex-British territories of the West Indies this is not a popcorn moment. Similar scenes of state capture unfold in these islands and, to be honest, it is just not cricket. Very few politicians here play with a straight bat and even when caught out, the umpire is seemingly blind. Spectators are leaving in droves: a massive brain drain has weakened Caribbean economies significantly over the past five decades, alongside cronyism, state capture and procurement fraud. The politicians left behind to run these countries are the most unqualified and unscrupulous one can find, a state referred to as a kakistocracy. Resources continue to be drained by corrupt infrastructure projects, while expenditure in health and education, critical to nation building, remains insufficient. But as these sectors fall behind the rest of the world, a new player has emerged in the Caribbean. In 2018, Trinidad and Tobago became the first Caribbean country to officially sign up to China’s $4tn global belt and road development initiative. Suriname, Guyana, Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada and even the progressive leadership in Barbados followed (“et tu Mia?”). Jamaica was last in to bat and did not put up much of a resistance. So what is China trying to achieve? Neocolonialism? Cynics would say there is no such thing as a free lunch. Just ask Sri Lanka and Uganda. The Hambantota port development project in Sri Lanka, led by the China Harbour Engineering Company, was predicted to fail and lived up to that expectation. The new Sri Lankan government, after struggling to make payments on the debt, handed over the port on a 99-year lease, including 15,000 acres of land. More recently, China has been forced to deny reports that it will gain control of Uganda’s Entebbe international airport if the country defaults on debt repayments. An old quote attributed to John Adams states that the way to subjugate a country is through either the sword or debt. China has assiduously chosen the latter. Debt deals have provoked criticism against Xi Jinping’s belt and road initiative and insinuations that his global investment and lending programme is nothing more than a trap, fuelling corruption and autocratic behaviour in struggling and vulnerable democracies. Some believe that the intent is twofold: to gain strategic trade footholds in the Caribbean and Latin America through debt and duress and to snare allies in its escalating feud with Taiwan. Taiwan’s remaining friends include Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Paraguay, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines. Much can be said for the rich kid who owns the bat – you can play as long as you are not mates with Taiwan. This will of course manifest in the UN arena as Xi buys more support though his use of corrosive capital. One can argue that the Caribbean islands don’t have much choice – the pandemic has been merciless to their economies. Should they approach the International Monetary Fund, cap in hand, and be subjected to austerity measures that make governments unpopular with their people? Is there another option? A recent photo of Clive Lloyd, captain of history’s most successful West Indies cricket team and one of the most successful test captains of all time, being knighted drew mixed reactions. The sight of Lloyd bending the knee, not in support of Colin Kaepernick, but to receive an affirmation from the monarchy of Britain, the ex-colonial masters, ignited fresh debate about reparations. Could reparations be the strategic tool for Europe to remove China’s hold on the Caribbean, and for these islands to throw off the shackles of poor governance, underdevelopment and inequality once and for all? It could be pure genius. In 2013, the Caricom Reparations Commission (CRC) was established by the Caribbean heads of governments to establish the moral, ethical and legal case for the payment of reparations by all the former colonial powers to the people of the Caribbean for the crimes against humanity of genocide, the transatlantic slave trade and the racialised system of chattel slavery. To deliver the CRC’s mandate, the Caricom Reparations Justice Program asserts that victims and descendants of these crimes have a legal right to reparatory justice, and that those who committed these crimes, and have been enriched by proceeds, have a reparatory case to answer. The CRC’s action plan includes debt cancellation, alongside financing of programmes including technology transfer, literacy, health and indigenous people’s development. It could take a long time to get all the parties to the table – a frequent remark by an old professor of mine resonates: “If you want to not get something done … form a committee”. But it is an opportunity. Transparency International’s 2021 index will reveal global corruption continuing to thwart opportunity, to hamstring countries’ abilities to protect public health and their economies during the pandemic. There has been no progress, only more allegations of Covid procurement fraud and corrupt contracts awarded to ministers’ friends and family. Last year, Delia Ferreira Rubio, the chair of Transparency International, said: “It’s a corruption crisis. And one that we’re currently failing to manage.” It is a sentiment unlikely to have changed.

1/25/2022,"Reaching net zero climate emissions by 2050 will require a “fundamental transformation of the global economy”, according to a report by McKinsey, one of the world’s most influential consulting firms. It estimates that $9.2tn will need to be invested every year for decades to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5C and end the climate emergency. The sum is a 40% increase on current investment levels and equivalent to half of global corporate profits.  The report warns that the economic transformation will affect every country and every sector, with those most reliant on fossil-fuel-burning experiencing the most change. McKinsey, which advises many governments and large companies, also says the transition will be front-loaded with, for example, the cost of electricity rising before falling later. However, the report says reaching net zero is vital to avoiding the most catastrophic impacts of global heating, which would harm billions of people, and that many low-carbon investments are opportunities for economic growth and would lead to a lower-cost, more efficient economy. It also says the transformation becomes more expensive the longer action is delayed. “$9.2tn is a very big number – big enough for anybody to pay attention to,” said Jonathan Woetzel at the McKinsey Global Institute, the consultancy’s in-house thinktank, and an author of the report. “But it’s not an impossible number. It’s not like we haven’t [made transformations] before in other ways”, such as the global shift to urban living. The economic transformation is from an economy that did not include the costs of environmental and social damage to one that does, according to Woetzel. “There will only be a sustainable economy, we won’t have any other kind.” The report says the front-loaded transformation raises a “critical question” of who will pay and whether higher costs of electricity, steel and cement are passed on to people or whether those on low-incomes are protected by governments. The goal of the report is to assess the scale of the economic transition required to reach net zero, assuming action is taken quickly, and concludes: “Achieving net zero would mean a fundamental transformation of the world economy.” It estimates that investment in energy, transport, buildings, industry and agriculture would need to rise by $3.5tn, with an additional $1tn of today’s spending switching from high-carbon to low-carbon goods, such as electric cars and heat pumps. As a proportion of global GDP, the total investment required would be 6.8%, rising to as much as 8.8% between 2026 and 2030 before falling. The McKinsey scenario suggests electricity costs could rise by 25% by 2040 before falling below today’s levels after 2050, because of the lower operating cost of renewable energy. Steel and cement face cost increases of about 30% and 45% respectively, it says. Bob Ward, a policiy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, UK, said: “The McKinsey investment figures are not the net costs of reaching net zero globally, but instead the upfront annual costs without taking into account the benefits. “Investments in clean infrastructure will generate jobs, growth and huge savings, particularly by eliminating the need to buy ruinously expensive fossil fuels, and [will] yield much bigger returns when taking into account the avoided loss of lives and livelihoods from air pollution and climate change.” The insurance firm Swiss Re recently estimated that the damage caused by a 2.6C rise in global temperature by 2050 would reduce global GDP by 14%. In October, the climate economist and life peer Nicholas Stern said: “The move to net zero can be the great driver of a new form of growth – the growth story of the 21st century.” “While the immediate tasks ahead may seem daunting, human ingenuity can ultimately solve the net zero equation, just as it has solved other seemingly intractable problems over the past 10,000 years,” the McKinsey report says. “The key issue is whether the world can muster the requisite boldness and resolve.” If it does, the report says, the rewards would far exceed the avoidance of climate impacts alone because countries would have to work together and would then be better positioned to address other “age-old” geopolitical issues. “That is a hopeful message, we believe, for people to realise that there’s a need to – and a capacity to – create greater global collaboration,” Woetzel said.",News/Environment,McKinsey: fundamental transformation of global economy needed for net zero,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/25/transformation-global-economy-net-zero-mckinsey
1/25/2022,"A decision by a leading Dutch university to refuse all further Chinese funding for a controversial study centre has sparked fresh concern about Beijing’s apparent attempts to influence debate at European educational institutions. Amsterdam’s Vrije Universiteit (VU), the fourth largest university in the Netherlands, has said it will accept no further money from the Southwest University of Political Science and Law in Chongqing and repay sums it recently received.  The announcement came after an investigation by the Dutch public broadcaster NOS last week revealed VU’s Cross Cultural Human Rights Center (CCHRC) had received between €250,000 (£210,000) and €300,000 annually from Southwest over the past few years. According to NOS, the CCHRC used Southwest’s money to fund a regular newsletter, organise seminars and maintain its website – which has published several posts rejecting western criticism of China’s human rights policy. In October 2020, for example, the site noted that academics associated with the CCHRC had recently visited four cities in Xinjiang province and concluded there was “definitely no discrimination of Uyghurs or other minorities in the region”. NOS cited Tom Zwart, a Leiden University human rights professor and president of the CCHRC, as telling Chinese state TV that human rights in China “must be seen in the context of domestic circumstances, and cannot copy the west”. Another associate of the centre, Peter Peverelli, has also described reports of forced labour camps for Uyghurs as “rumours” and said it is fashionable to criticise China. “Xinjiang is just lovely,” Peverelli said, according to the public broadcaster. “Lovely people, breathtaking nature, great food. And no forced labour, no genocide, or whatever other lies the western media might come up with.” The centre, which counts among its affiliates academics from institutions in the Netherlands, China and other countries, describes itself as an independent research institute aimed at encouraging open cross-cultural debate about human rights concepts and issues. VU said in a statement that “even the appearance of research not being independent is unacceptable”. The university would accept no further funding from China, return last year’s money and launch a full inquiry, the statement said. Zwart told NOS the website was a forum for academic free speech and posts did not necessarily reflect CCHRC’s research findings. The fact that some views on the site aligned with Chinese government positions did not indicate formal support, he said. The Dutch education minister, Robbert Dijkgraaf, said he was “very shocked” by the revelations, adding: “Academic freedom, integrity and independence must be guaranteed and it is important that Dutch institutions remain alert to possible risks of undesired influence by other countries and take adequate measures.” The incident follows multiple other examples of China’s efforts to exercise soft power through European academic institutions, which in November prompted Germany’s then education minister to demand universities review all their links with China. Anja Karliczek said Chinese influence over universities was “unacceptable” amid accusations that about 200 state-funded Confucius institutes at academic institutions in Europe were merely “spreading propaganda for the Chinese Communist party”. Despite fears of “elite capture” and even a threat to national security, Hungary in May announced plans to open a branch of China’s prestigious Shanghai-based Fudan University in Budapest, saying it would raise higher education standards and bring Chinese investment and research to the country. Britain’s former higher education minister, Jo Johnson, said in March last year that the risks involved in Beijing’s investment in the UK’s universities was “​​poorly understood” after a study identified “a significant increase in funding from China and collaboration with Chinese researchers over the past two decades”. “The UK needs to do a better job of measuring, managing and mitigating risks that are at present poorly understood and monitored,” Johnson said. Failure to do so risks real damage to our knowledge economy.” The report found a significant increase over the past 20 years in Chinese funding for university research including in such sensitive areas as automation, materials science and telecommunications, as well as in disciplines where collaboration “may threaten freedom of speech”.",News/World news,Dutch university gives up Chinese funding due to impartiality concerns,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/25/dutch-university-gives-up-chinese-funding-due-to-impartiality-concerns
1/25/2022,"The aged care and sport minister, Richard Colbeck, attended the Ashes cricket on the same day he declined to appear at the Covid-19 committee citing officials’ “urgent and critical” work combating Omicron. In an update to his register of interests, Colbeck declared that he received “sponsored travel or hospitality” to attend three days of the Hobart Test between Australia and England from Friday 14 to Sunday 16 January.  Labor and independent senator Rex Patrick have blasted Colbeck for attending the cricket instead of the Senate Covid committee, which had asked him to a hearing on 14 January. A spokesperson for Colbeck said the suggestion he had “put his sporting commitments ahead of the health and wellbeing of senior Australians … [is] completely misguided” because he had performed other Covid-related duties on that day and the Test was a day-nighter. Colbeck was asked to appear alongside officials from the health department, but he and the prime minister’s department, which was to appear later in the day, rejected the proposed date, citing urgent Covid work. In a letter dated 7 January, the committee’s chair, Katy Gallagher, noted the “fast-evolving Covid-19 Omicron situation” and requested Colbeck attend to “facilitate the Senate’s scrutiny role” of the government’s response. Two days later, Colbeck replied that although he and the department “recognise the importance of accountability to the Senate” he was “concerned about the impact of the timing of this hearing”. “The Covid-19 pandemic is at a critical point with the onset of numerous Omicron outbreaks,” he said. “Diverting time and resources, including that of senior leaders within the department who are playing a key role in the management of the current Omicron outbreaks, to give evidence before the committee at this crucial time would impact the urgent and critical work the department is undertaking with other government agencies, states and territories to manage these outbreaks.” Colbeck offered an interim one-hour private videoconference briefing from the health department, which Gallagher rejected as an unsuitable alternative to a public hearing. The committee had asked for just two hours and 45 minutes of hearing time from Colbeck and the department. Gallagher’s letter acknowledged the invitation was at “short notice” because the outbreak occurred over the Christmas New Year period. Gallagher said “Australians have done their job throughout this pandemic and they expect Scott Morrison’s ministers to do their job”. “It is completely unacceptable that a minister in this government, who is overseeing another crisis in aged care where people are dying, chose to go to the cricket for three days of sponsored hospitality instead of fronting up to do his job,” she told Guardian Australia. Patrick told Guardian Australia that “a minister’s first responsibility is to parliament” and Colbeck “owes a duty to the public to turn up and answer questions” at the inquiry into the pandemic response. He said the committee wished to examine the Omicron variant, availability of rapid antigen tests, back to school plans, and how to “protect the elderly and vulnerable” in aged care. “These are important issues – far more important than the cricket,” Patrick said. “As much as I root for the Australian cricket team, I have a job to do and I would always put that before attending a game.” Colbeck’s spokesperson said on 14 January the minister had helped deal with the Omicron outbreak by meeting the head of the Covid vaccine rollout Lt Gen John Frewen, the aged care quality and safety commissioner, the acting secretary of health and the deputy chief medical officer. The spokesperson said Colbeck’s attendance at the test was “part of his commitments as minister for sport and Senator for Tasmania” and the Test “ was a “day/night match [that] did not start until late afternoon”. “At a time when the Australian government continues to work to protect the lives of senior Australians in care, attempts by the Senate select committee on Covid-19 to redirect resources away from the department of health for political purposes is of serious concern and should be noted by Australians as we navigate the impact of the pandemic.” Gallagher has previously criticised the Morrison government’s transparency with the bipartisan Senate committee, accusing it of obstructing access to information with public immunity claims. The prime minister’s department also requested the proposed 14 January hearing be deferred, with deputy secretary Stephanie Foster warning it could “divert attention and resources of senior staff” managing the outbreak. The committee then scheduled hearings on 21 January for the health department and 25 January for Colbeck, the latter at his request. On 19 January the acting health department secretary, Penny Shakespeare, objected to the “diversion of resources” of staff who were “essential to a rapid, effective response” in attending the two proposed hearings. Those hearings were cancelled for unrelated reasons. According to his register of interests, Colbeck also received sponsored travel or hospitality to attend the Adelaide Test on 16 December. Colbeck’s presence in the media since Christmas has been limited to issuing a statement that warned about the risk of drowning and one interview on Radio National on 6 January about the Novak Djokovic visa cancellation saga. He has previously come under fire for not knowing how many aged care workers have been vaccinated and not knowing the number of people who have died in aged care.",News/Australia news,Aged care minister Richard Colbeck went to Ashes Test on same day he declined to appear at Covid committee,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/25/aged-care-minister-richard-colbeck-went-to-ashes-test-on-same-day-he-declined-to-appear-at-covid-committee
1/25/2022,"Dylan Alcott wheels out of the tunnel and into Kia Arena, either talking to himself or bopping to an unheard beat. Cap backwards, signature Nike kicks, ready to roll. One match stands between him and the Australian Open final – his last before retirement – and he is serving first against Britain’s Andy Lapthorne. “Good serve, Dyl,” he says to himself after the opening point when Lapthorne overcooks his return. Alcott has no problem telling anyone exactly how he is feeling. That includes his opponents, and a couple of games later, right before he breaks Lapthorne’s serve, he booms down the court “Good job, Dyl”. The celebrations only grow louder the closer he edges towards the 6-3, 6-0 victory. His penultimate wheelchair tennis match, period.  Not many people can get away with referring to themselves in the third person. Alcott somehow does, perhaps partly because of his self-deprecating humour, but also partly because of what he has come to represent. Few match the Australian’s drive to reshape perceptions around disability. Among the projects to which he dedicates his time and his name are the Dylan Alcott Foundation, Get Skilled Access and AbilityFest – Australia’s first accessible and fully inclusive music festival (he has also crowd surfed at Coachella, in his chair). He is Victoria’s nomination for Australian of the year and will find out on Tuesday night if he has won the big one (“I think I’m no chance … I think Patty Mills is going to win”). In many ways he already has. His resume reads 15 grand slam quad singles titles and a further eight in doubles. In 2021 he became the first man in history to achieve a golden slam of all four major singles titles as well as Paralympic gold. He has been Australian Open champion seven years running. By Thursday he could have an eighth title. On this occasion Alcott’s ball-striking was too strong for Lapthorne, who was courageous in defeat but also appeared to play through a shoulder problem. He embraced his opposition at the net, then whooped the crowd. “I got a bit emotional, he is a beautiful man,” Alcott said. “He said thanks for everything, thanks for making his dreams come true. We did this together. Andy started before I did. We are the same age. First grand slam on a centre court was with this man, Andy Lapthorne.” Alcott has brought Australia and much of the world with him on his journey. The countless interviews at international tennis and sporting events, including the Invictus Games, ensure people living with impairments get time in the spotlight. If he has to protest, he will. In 2020, during the first wave of the pandemic he accused the US Open of “disgusting discrimination” over its decision to drop the wheelchair event. When the tournament back-flipped and had it reinstated, he praised them wholeheartedly. On Sunday, after his hard-fought quarter-final win over 19-year-old Dutchman Niels Vink, who he also defeated in the Tokyo 2020 semi-finals and then the US Open final, Alcott stood on court and thanked his family. “I hated myself growing up,” he said, “and the reason I don’t [anymore] is them.” Alcott has spoken numerous times about how he was bullied during high school over his disability, something he had lived with since he was three weeks old when an operation to remove a tumour wrapped around his spinal cord was successful but left him a paraplegic. Since then he has been in charge of his own image. Which is to say he is himself, and comfortable with everything that entails. Ebullient larrikinism speckled with unpolished realness is the general vibe. When he announced his retirement in November he joked he didn’t think anybody would turn up to his press conference. The room was full. At Melbourne Park the aim is to go out on a high, a decision he made during a period of depression at a time which should have been joyous. “I can’t tell you how much I struggled after the golden slam,” he said on Tuesday. “I had actual depression. I hadn’t seen my family – it was the biggest moment of my life, and I’m in a hotel. “I was watching my good mate [Melbourne Demons captain] Max Gawn kick on and party after the premiership, and I was still in quarantine. I’m normally the positive guy but it was really hard … so I went, ‘I can do two things: I can dial it in this Australian Open, go out every weekend and half-ass it and lose, or – because I can see the finish line – I can go all in, 11 sessions a week, every day, no break’.” For the sake of his mental health he opted for the latter. “I’m really glad that I did,” he said. “And I look great, if I say so myself. That’s why I’m wearing no sleeves this year.” Does he feel as good as he looks? In Melbourne’s infamous heat, not always. “I was in the locker room with Gael Monfils,” he said after he beat Vink. “He won in straight [sets], we’re both, like, cooked. I was like, ‘We are old’, and he’s like 35. We were both like this [hands on hips], we were both laughing going, ‘Oh my god, I’m the oldest man in the world’.” At 31, Alcott does not quite meet the criteria for golden oldie status, but he has earned the right to claim it anyway. The semi-final had left him “washed up” and in need of a beer. No doubt he will be offered one at tonight’s ceremony in Canberra, then he will return to Melbourne to play Sam Schröder of the Netherlands for the trophy. “It would be unbelievable, but it wouldn’t be everything, right? I will live if I don’t win on Thursday,” he said. “I’ve got the best life in the world, regardless of whether I win … I’m just going to go out there and enjoy every little second of it, because I’ll never get that opportunity again.”",Sport/Sport,Dylan Alcott enjoying last hurrah as he sets up final shot at more grand slam glory | Emma Kemp,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/25/dylan-alcott-enjoying-last-hurrah-as-he-sets-up-final-shot-at-yet-more-grand-slam-glory
