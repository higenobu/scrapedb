12/23/2021,"The Omicron variant of Covid-19 is now the dominant strain in England, South Africa, and probably in the US, according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control. So do we know how many of Australia’s latest cases are due to Omicron, and if it’s the dominant strain in the country yet?  The short answer is that it may be, but this comes with a lot of caveats. First, some background on how we detect Omicron and other variants. The Omicron variant shares a characteristic mutation with another, older variant of concern called Alpha. Both variants have a mutation in the “S gene”, which means they show up differently to other coronavirus variants when using one of the common PCR tests used to check for Covid-19. This means that we can use the absence of the S gene, called “S gene dropout” or “S gene target failure” as a proxy for tracking the rise of the Omicron variant. Some countries, such as the UK, have used this information to estimate the prevalence of Omicron over time. However, only full genome sequencing can conclusively identify the strain – this means the whole genome of the virus is identified, rather than the presence of small, specific parts of the genome used in PCR. Australia doesn’t publish S gene dropout numbers, but most positive cases undergo sequencing. As at June 2021 at least 58% of cases had been sequenced. Some information on variants of concern is then published by the communicable diseases genomics network. As of their update on 20 December, 386 Omicron cases had been identified, most in NSW. Unfortunately this data only includes totals for the whole pandemic, so it can’t be used to show the proportion of Delta or Omicron in recent cases. Most of the Australian sequence data is shared internationally with a group called GISAID, a collaboration of scientists from around the world pooling Covid-19 genomic information to aid research and health responses. Thanks to another group of scientists who run the NextStrain and CoVariants websites that analyse the GISAID data, we can see the change in the proportion of variants of concern over time. Before we take a look at the numbers, there are some important caveats. This sequencing data represents a sample of the overall Covid-19 case population, and there is a lag between when a case is identified and when the sequence data is published. This means the most recent time points are incomplete. Dr Norelle Sherry is a scientist at the Doherty Institute and physician at the Austin Hospital, who is involved with genomic sequencing for pathogen surveillance. She says there is also some variation in sequencing strategies between jurisdictions. “For example, Victoria and NSW are both sub-sampling a portion of the positive cases due to the high case numbers. “There may be some biases in the sampling particularly recently, as samples are screened with PCR tests, and possible Omicron samples (such as S-gene target failures or dropouts) are prioritised for sequencing, so current sequences may not reflect the true underlying population.” On 19 December NSW Health announced it would be undertaking genomic sequencing for the Omicron variant only in circumstances where it would make a clinical difference to the care of a patient. With all that in mind, the most recent data shows Omicron accounted for 45 out of 58 cases that have been sequenced and published since 13 December, or 78%. To put the total number of sequenced cases into perspective, and emphasising that the most recently published figures are only a small fraction of total cases, here is the same data but showing the total numbers, rather than percentages. This data will change as more cases are added to the database, and it may be that Omicron cases will still be outnumbered by Delta for the next few weeks. However scientists expect Omicron to become the dominant strain in Australia. Associate prof Stuart Turville, a virologist at the Kirby Institute, says: “Even among vaccinated populations it is likely that Omicron will take over as the dominant variant. We should expect to see significant community spread. “Day by day we’ll know more, but for now, people should follow government advice on boosters, social distance, wear masks where appropriate and follow the public health orders.” In NSW, health authorities have already said they believe Omicron “likely accounts for the majority” of recent cases.",News/World news,"How much of the Omicron variant is there in Australia, and is it the dominant strain?

12/23/2021,"Nurses, care home staff and police officers working on Christmas Day will be thousands of pounds worse off than they were a decade ago as a result of wages failing to keep pace with prices, Trades Union Congress analysis has shown. Urging the government to raise the minimum wage to £10 an hour, the TUC said the key workers expected to keep Britain going on 25 December had taken real pay cuts since 2010.  Police sergeants and constables have had the biggest reduction, with inflation-adjusted pay £5,595 a year lower than a decade ago. Nurses have had an effective wage cut of £2,715 and local authority care workers a cut of £1,661, the report found. A chef would be earning £1,050 more a year this Christmas had pay kept pace with price rises, while a waiter would be £859 better off, the TUC said. The coming year is expected to bring a fresh squeeze on living standards. Annual inflation is running at 5.1% and expected by the Bank of England to peak at about 6% in the spring. Meanwhile, earnings including bonuses in the three months to October were up 4.9% on the same period in 2020. Frances O’Grady, the TUC’s general secretary, said: “Many of the key workers who are bracing themselves for another surge of Covid cases are earning less in real terms than they were a decade ago. That is not right. “While many of us are tucking into the turkey, thousands of key workers will be hard at work on the front line, many of them dealing with staff shortages as a result of the Omicron variant. But their pay awards are falling way short of what they should be, especially in a cost-of-living crisis. “The pandemic must be a turning point; 2022 should be the year that the government finally gets wages rising across the UK. They can start by giving our public service workers a proper pay rise, and by raising the minimum wage to £10 an hour.” The national minimum wage is £8.91 an hour and will rise to £9.50 an hour in April.",Lifestyle/Money,"Essential workers thousand of pounds worse off than a decade ago, TUC says",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/dec/23/essential-workers-thousand-of-pounds-worse-off-than-a-decade-ago-tuc-says
12/23/2021,"A vision document on a strategy for women’s health in England will be published by the Department of Health and Social Care on Thursday after nearly 100,000 women came forward to share their healthcare experiences. The document will set out initial government commitments on women’s health, recognising that system-wide changes are needed to tackle “decades of gender health inequality”. The final plan – the Women’s Health Strategy – will be published in the spring.  The Women’s Health Strategy is expected to include a focus on six key areas, the Guardian has learned. These “priority areas” relate to specific conditions or areas of health where the public consultation highlighted particular issues. In the consultation, menstrual health was the topic most chosen by respondents aged 16-17 for inclusion in the Women’s Health Strategy, and gynaecological conditions was the No 1 topic selected by those aged 18-29. Women said they “persistently needed to advocate for themselves” and to push for further investigation in order to secure a diagnosis, speaking to doctors on multiple occasions over many months or years for conditions such as endometriosis. These delays often had wider ramifications for their health and quality of life. Fertility, pregnancy, pregnancy loss and postnatal support was the most cited topic for women aged 30-39. Responses covered a wide range of issues, including contraception, preconception health, fertility and infertility, pregnancy loss and stillbirth, support for expectant and new mothers and their partners, pelvic floor health, and patient experience and safety. Information was another key theme, with calls for more information on the causes of infertility, the likelihood of a successful pregnancy at a later age, information relating to women’s health before pregnancy, and the realistic success rates of fertility treatments. Another key issue raised was miscarriage and pregnancy loss. The menopause was the most selected topic for women aged 40-59. Only 9% of respondents felt that they had enough information on the menopause. Another important theme was access to treatment, with women reporting that symptoms were not taken seriously or recognised as the menopause, and that there were difficulties in accessing HRT, with some GPs reluctant to prescribe it. Healthy ageing was the top topic for women aged 60 and over. Women also said that they would like the Women’s Health Strategy to cover long-term conditions such as musculoskeletal conditions, heart disease and stroke. There was also a demand for action on specific conditions that are more prevalent in women or where there are disparities in access to service or outcomes, such as osteoporosis. Some responses also said health in the workplace could be a particular challenge for older women, who may experience menopause symptoms, and who may have caring responsibilities. Mental health was in the top five most popular topics selected by women for inclusion in the Women’s Health Strategy, and was consistent across every age group. Overall, 65% of women felt comfortable talking to friends about mental health conditions. But the issue was commonly cited when women were asked to give an example of an area in which they felt that they had not been listened to by a healthcare professional. Women flagged that they would like to see improved access to mental health services, and that they had struggled to access mental health services and support during the pandemic. Some also said that better mental health support in the workplace would help them to reach their full potential. Women told the consultation that the effects of domestic abuse and violence on women’s health were wide ranging and extensive, and had a long-term effect on their physical and mental health. There was a call for health settings to be a trusted environment that provided a primary way for victims and survivors to access support. In the survey, only 9% of respondents felt that they had enough information about specialist NHS services such as female genital mutilation clinics or sexual assault referral areas.",News/Society,A strategy for women’s health in England: six areas of focus,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/23/womens-health-strategy-england-six-priorities
12/23/2021,"Almost 16,000 children in the UK could be exposed to domestic abuse this Christmas, a leading research charity has estimated, calling on ministers to commit to funding specialist support services in the new year. The tragic cases of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes and Star Hobson, two young children murdered in their homes, have recently cast a spotlight on the risks of domestic abuse to children.  The Early Intervention Foundation (EIF), a charity that advocates effective early intervention to improve the lives of children, said the Christmas period could be particularly stressful for families, which may lead to more domestic abuse. It is estimated that 3.2% of under-11s and 2.5% of 11- to 17-year-olds are exposed to domestic violence, which EIF said equated to 15,948 over the two-week festive period, which would be a rise from 15,006 the previous Christmas. The Home Office is expected to publish a domestic abuse strategy in 2022, after the Domestic Abuse Act received royal assent this year. Dr Jo Casebourne, the chief executive of the EIF, said: “Given the numbers of children affected by domestic abuse, it is vital that we fully understand how best to help them. “The domestic abuse strategy must focus on improving services for child victims of domestic abuse. There are longstanding gaps in provision for families, including in relation to the availability of prevention services and long-term therapeutic support, support for babies and very young children and culturally specific interventions for minority groups. “That’s why we are calling on safeguarding minister Rachel Maclean to ensure that the domestic abuse strategy includes a commitment to fund and evaluate the most promising support, in order to build crucial evidence of what works for families affected by domestic abuse.” Early in December, the case of six-year-old Arthur Labinjo-Hughes shocked the country. The boy was subjected to a sadistic campaign of cruelty by his stepmother and father. He was physically assaulted, poisoned with salt and forced to stand in isolation for up to 14 hours a day in the months leading up to his death. Emma Tustin, 32, was sentenced to life with a minimum of 29 years for the murder of Arthur, while his father, 29-year-old Thomas Hughes, was given 21 years in prison for manslaughter. The national Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panel announced it would examine the circumstances leading up to Arthur’s death. Findings from a report on the death of 16-month-old Star Hobson will also feed into the national review. Star suffered weeks of “neglect, cruelty and injury” from her mother’s partner, 28-year-old Savannah Brockhill. The toddler died of cardiac arrest after being punched or kicked by Brockhill in September 2020 using “massive force” on a par associated with “a road traffic accident”. Brockhill was jailed for life with a minimum term of 25 years, while Star’s mother, Frankie Smith, was jailed for eight years after she was found guilty of causing or allowing the toddler’s death but cleared of murder and manslaughter charges. The EIF said children who had experienced domestic abuse were significantly more likely to experience abuse in their own adult relationships, to misuse drugs or alcohol, and to have lower levels of wellbeing. In a report earlier this year, the charity identified a significant lack of evidence on what support works to effectively help children who have experienced, or who are at risk of experiencing, domestic abuse. The safeguarding minister, Maclean, said: “Nobody should feel unsafe in their own home and we are determined to ensure all victims of domestic abuse, including children, get the support they need. “That is why this year we are providing over £3m to specialist services for children experiencing domestic abuse which is enabling a range of therapeutic support and early intervention schemes for children impacted by this devastating crime. “The new Domestic Abuse Act is fundamentally transforming our response as it recognises children as victims of domestic abuse in their own right and our upcoming domestic abuse strategy will set out our plan to tackle all forms of this crime, including that experienced by children, in due course.”",News/Society,"Charity says 16,000 UK children could be exposed to domestic abuse at Christmas",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/23/charity-says-16000-uk-children-could-be-exposed-to-domestic-abuse-at-christmas
12/23/2021,"Ministers are concerned about women’s health, they have declared today. Many women who have been shouting about glaring health inequalities for far too long may be forgiven for saying under their breaths: about bloody time. In many countries men face greater health risks, but not in the UK. A study from Manual, a wellbeing platform for men, has found the UK has the largest female health gap among G20 countries and the 12th largest globally.  Research published by the House of Lords earlier this year pointed out that study after study showed poorer outcomes for women. In 2016, researchers at University College London found that women with dementia received worse medical treatment than men with the condition, made fewer visits to the GP, received less health monitoring and took more potentially harmful medication. Women, in particular young women, are also more likely to experience common mental health conditions than men, despite the fact that men account for about three-quarters of deaths registered as suicide. The inequalities start well before women make it to their doctor’s surgery. Women are routinely underrepresented in clinical trials, and medical research proposed by women, for women, is not allotted the same funding as medical research proposed by men, for, you guessed it, men. Tireless work by the campaigner and writer Caroline Criado Perez demonstrates that, as she states in her book Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men, healthcare is “systematically discriminating against women, leaving them chronically misunderstood, mistreated and misdiagnosed”. Sexism is still rampant in healthcare, not least among staff. Despite the fact the NHS workforce is dominated by women, men working in NHS trusts are still paid more than their female peers. It permeates the system, from women’s pain being dismissed by their GPs, to women struggling to get the menopause drugs they need on the NHS. The consequences can be catastrophic. In June 2020 a government inquiry found that an arrogant culture in which serious medical complications were dismissed as “women’s problems” contributed to a string of healthcare scandals over several decades. A recognition today by the women’s health minister Maria Caufield that there were “shocking” cases among the 100,000 women who answered a government consultation is welcome, as is the announcement that there will be a women’s health ambassador. The creation of a menopause taskforce rides a wave of greater understanding of a condition that affects half the population but was, until very recently, taboo. And it is good to see that campaigners’ calls to ban hymen restoration surgery have finally been heeded after the government earlier promised to ban virginity testing. But gender inequality in healthcare runs deep. Recognising, as the government has today, that system-wide changes are needed to tackle “decades of gender health inequality” is a vital first step yet, as Criado-Perez has said, women have been considered less important in healthcare as far back as Ancient Greece. This spring’s Women’s Health Strategy will need to have a lot more meat, in particular a commitment to sex-disaggregated data within a healthcare system still providing PPE designed for men to many of its staff – and years of sustained funding if that is to be reversed.",News/Society,Finally the UK has noticed its rampant sexism in healthcare. What now?,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/23/finally-the-uk-has-noticed-its-rampant-sexism-in-healthcare-what-now
12/23/2021,"Children in the UK will be the first in Europe to receive a life-changing treatment for peanut allergies, after NHS England secured a deal for a drug that decreases the severity of symptoms including anaphylaxis. The oral treatment, Palforzia, will be available to up to 600 children aged four to 17 the first year and 2,000 the following year.  The news will help affected families as they navigate anxiety over everyday events like mealtimes, birthday parties and eating out, and carry adrenaline injections to treat anaphylaxis, a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. About one in 50 UK children suffer from peanut allergies. The treatment stems from from two large peanut allergy clinical trials – the Palisade and Artemis studies – which the Evelina London children’s hospital took part in. Sophie Pratt, whose nine-year-old daughter, Emily, took part in the trial, told PA Media it “had changed our whole family’s lives”. “The treatment we received has meant that Emily is free from limits and the fear that the tiniest mistake could put her life at risk, and it has removed all the tension and worry that the simple act of eating loomed over us every day,” she said Since the trial, Emily had been able to attend parties with confidence, feed animals at the zoo and take her first holiday to New York, Pratt said. The change “was particularly noticeable at special occasions like birthdays, Christmas and on holidays where there are often special foods like cakes, ice cream and treats that invariably had warnings, ‘may contain peanuts’ or menus not in English,” Pratt added. An Imperial College London study found that, of the 187 people who died from anaphylaxis in the UK from 1992 to 2018, at least 86, or 46%, suffered from peanut or other nut allergies. In the Artemis study, six in 10 children were able to eat a dose of peanut protein of 1,000mg – well above the accidental exposure amount – by the end of the trial, whereas previously they had reacted to 10mg. Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, said the treatment would “reduce the fear and anxiety for patients and their families who may have been living with this allergy for years. “This pioneering treatment can be life-changing for patients and their families and, thanks to the deal the NHS has struck, people here will be the first in Europe to benefit,” he said. Powis added that families should be able to “enjoy meals out or holidays abroad together without worrying about an allergic reaction that could land them in hospital or worse”. Former Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson, who has a nut allergy, had to be injected with adrenaline at Glasgow’s Southern General hospital in 2013 after eating a biscuit containing nuts. “It was a very scary experience,” she said. George du Toit, children’s allergy consultant at Evelina London and senior investigator on the UK trials, said Palforzia’s approval was a “significant step forward” and would “protect against accidental exposure to peanuts”.",News/Society,NHS England to offer life-changing drug to children with peanut allergy,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/23/nhs-england-to-offer-life-changing-drug-to-children-with-peanut-allergy
12/23/2021,"Ministers have pledged to “reset the dial” on women’s health to tackle decades of gender inequality in England, with plans to appoint a women’s health tsar, eradicate medical taboos, boost menopause support and ban harmful “virginity repair” operations. The Department of Health and Social Care will publish its Vision for Women’s Health strategy today after 100,000 women came forward to share their healthcare concerns. Maria Caulfield, the minister for women’s health, described some of their experiences as “shocking”.  The vision document will set out initial government commitments on women’s health, recognising that “systemwide changes” are needed to tackle “decades of gender health inequality”. The final plan – the Women’s Health Strategy – will be published in spring 2022. On Wednesday night, ministers pledged to introduce legislation criminalising hymenoplasty or any procedure to rebuild or repair the hymen. Such surgery creates scar tissue so that a woman will bleed the next time she has intercourse, making it appear she has never had sex. Young women can be forced to prove they are “pure” on their wedding night. Doctors have called for a ban on the surgery for years, saying it can never be justified on health grounds and is harmful. Separately, the government will appoint a women’s health ambassador to raise the profile of key issues and boost awareness of taboo topics. Ministers will also establish a UK-wide menopause taskforce to investigate how women going through the menopause can be better supported. The cost of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) prescriptions will also be cut by implementing longer prescribing cycles so women will need fewer prescriptions and therefore pay less. The consultation provided “stark and sobering insights” into women’s experiences of health and care and highlighted entrenched problems within the NHS, officials said. Eight in 10 women said they felt they were not listened to by healthcare professionals, and there was a feeling that services for specialities or conditions that only affect women were of “lower priority” compared to other health services. Ministers are also considering compulsory training for GPs on women’s health after the idea was raised by women who came forward. The vision document said: “We also heard about a lack of awareness amongst some GPs of the causes of infertility, miscarriages and their relationship with infertility, and the reasons for in vitro fertilisation (IVF) failure.” Many women also felt that damaging taboos and stigmas in women’s health prevented them from seeking help, and over half of respondents said they felt uncomfortable talking about health issues with their workplace. “The responses from the call for evidence were in many ways as expected, particularly with regards to women’s priorities, but in some places the revelations were shocking,” said Caulfield, who worked as a nurse before entering politics and returned to the frontline during the Covid pandemic. “It is not right that over three-quarters of women feel the healthcare service has not listened,” she added. “This must be addressed. Many of the issues raised require long-term systemwide changes, but we must start somewhere. I am proud to publish our vision for women’s health. It is the first step to realising our ambition of a healthcare system which supports women’s needs throughout their lives.” The vision document says all women should “feel comfortable talking about their health” and “no longer face taboos when they do”. They should have access to “high-quality information and education from childhood through to adulthood, in school and beyond”. Actor Mika Simmons, the host of The Happy Vagina podcast and the co-chair of the Ginsburg Women’s Health Board, said: “Women’s healthcare has been sidelined for far too long and a seismic shift now needs to happen to correct the historical lack of efficient care. I look forward to seeing changes made, at government level, to ensure women receive better support with our reproductive, gynaecological and sexual wellbeing.” Prof Geeta Nargund, an NHS consultant and medical director at Create Fertility, said there must also be a renewed focus on health conditions affecting black, Asian and minority ethnic women, “who have historically struggled to access support”. She added: “The results of this consultation are only the beginning, and we must work together to support our NHS and healthcare system to deliver the best service possible for all women.” The campaigner Nimco Ali said urgent action was needed “to address the gender health gap” and welcomed the response to the consultation. “We have already seen progress in so many areas but this data will ensure future policy is delivered where it is most needed and will be most effective.” Dr Edward Morris, the president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said he welcomed the decision to ban hymenoplasty after a ban on virginity testing earlier this year. “Neither have any place in the medical world,” he said. “Women deserve to have ownership over their own sexual and reproductive health.” This decision came after a recommendation from an independent expert panel, as the process is intrinsically linked to virginity testing and reinforces outdated attitudes towards a woman’s sexuality. Morris added: “We are very concerned that women in vulnerable and desperate situations are being coerced or pressured into having these procedures to prove that they are a virgin. The ban of both of these procedures will help to eradicate harmful beliefs which place false value on a person’s virginity.”",News/Society,Ministers pledge to ‘reset the dial’ on women’s health in England,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/23/ministers-pledge-to-reset-the-dial-on-womens-health-in-england
