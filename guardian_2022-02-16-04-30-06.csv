2/16/2022,"Downing Street staff have been told not to confer with each other when answering a Metropolitan police questionnaire about potentially Covid rule-breaking parties, with a warning this could constitute a “separate offence”. Fresh guidance issued by the Cabinet Office on Tuesday to those who may be contacted by Scotland Yard about the dozen gatherings under investigation said they could still “seek legal advice” before responding.  The questionnaires began to be issued late last week – including to the prime minister, Boris Johnson – and officers will “continue to contact individuals this coming week”, the leaked document said. Officials were told they could call a “legal information helpline at no cost to the individual”, which is an existing resource available to all civil servants. It gives them access to a 20-minute general consultation with a dedicated legal adviser on a range of issues, including the “impact of criminal activities”. While the document said the Met had not told the Cabinet Office how long the investigation would take, it noted that enquiries were “progressing at pace”. Those asked to fill in the questionnaire were told they should give an explanation for their alleged attendance at the event in question, allowing them a chance to provide “further circumstances you want the Met to take into account”. It added: “You are entitled to seek legal advice before you respond to the questionnaire and you can discuss your response with your legal adviser. “If you discuss your answers with anyone else who may have been involved this could amount to a separate offence.” Scotland Yard has said all responses to the questionnaires issued must be submitted within seven days of receipt. In the question and answer document prepared by a special liaison unit set up in the Cabinet Office, government workers were told to “make arrangements to ensure you can access your emails if you are on holiday” to ensure they met the deadline. If uncomfortable about the Met contacting them via their work email address, officials were reassured they could give the Cabinet Office “an alternative email address” for any further contact. The document confirmed a previous commitment that anyone who receives a fixed penalty notice “will not be publicly identified” by the Met. It said Scotland Yard “will not make public the details of their investigation and therefore your line manager will not be notified”. The document also warned that while fines for attendance at events that broke Covid laws started at £100, anyone found to “have organised or facilitated a large gathering” could face a charge of up to £10,000. Despite the Met having been passed 300 photographs as part of its investigation – known as Operation Hillman – the memo said the Cabinet Office “would not expect the Met to publish photographs”. The Cabinet Office also said it did not know if the Met would release a breakdown of how many fixed penalty notices would be handed out for each event. Last week, Downing Street pledged to reveal if Johnson is fined by police for attending any parties while Covid restrictions were in force. However the prime minister refused to rule out staying on even if he is found to have broken the law. He told journalists: “We’re going to wait for the process to be completed.” Once the Met’s investigation is over, the full findings of an investigation run by the senior civil servant Sue Gray are expected to be published.",News/UK news,No 10 staff warned not to confer in replies to Met police’s parties inquiry,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/15/no-10-staff-warned-not-to-confer-in-replies-to-met-polices-parties-inquiry
2/16/2022,"A children’s home in Bolton has been shut down after inspectors found that one boy had not bathed, changed his clothes or been provided with a home-cooked meal since he arrived in September 2021. Inexperienced and underqualified staff had not entered one bedroom for more than four months despite evidence of flies and “a pungent smell” that spread throughout the home, Ofsted inspectors discovered.  Another child was placed at risk of harm by staff carrying out “unnecessary” cardiac pulmonary resuscitation on them. After the inspection on 5 and 6 January, Ofsted took immediate action and suspended the registration of the home. The private home only opened in August 2021. It was run by Achieve Care Homes Ltd, which offers what it describes as “therapeutic residential placements” in “the absolute best home environment” for young people aged 8-18 with emotional, behavioural and socially challenging behaviour. Campaigners said it was an example of how unsuitable private providers were allowed to enter the market without sufficient checks during the pandemic. Martin Barrow, a foster carer and former journalist who campaigns on children’s social care, wrote on Twitter: “There was a rush to approve children’s homes during the pandemic. Many do not meet the lowest threshold for quality of care. These arrangements should now be reviewed.” The children’s rights campaigner Carolyne Willow said: “I’ve read hundreds and hundreds of inspection reports over the years but this really stood out for being disgraceful on every count. It is absolutely appalling and heart-stopping in places and it signals a whole catalogue of failures.” The inspection found “serious and widespread failures that mean children and young people are not protected or their welfare is not promoted or safeguarded, and the care and experiences of children and young people are poor, and they are not making progress”. Staff were found to spend “very little time” with some children, and were unable to build a positive and meaningful relationship with them. “One child spends most of their time in their bedroom, including eating all their meals in there. The daily records show that staff carry out a ‘welfare check’ approximately every hour during the day, with very little interaction recorded. This is not a caring or nurturing environment for the children,” the inspectors wrote. They added: “Staff lack the skills to challenge inappropriate behaviour effectively, such as the children refusing to allow staff to access their bedrooms. Consequently, staff left a child living in squalid conditions, which placed them at the risk of harm.” Staff also did not sufficiently support or encourage children to attend education. One child was scheduled to see a tutor for up to 30 minutes every other day, but the sessions often didn’t happen and no records were kept to monitor the attendance. Only two members of staff at the home held childcare qualifications. The fact they allowed one child’s room to be so dirty that it attracted flies “demonstrates that managers and staff do not understand their roles and responsibilities in providing basic nurturing care or appropriate support to children that they are responsible for”, the inspector concluded. Achieve Care Homes Ltd also admitted children into the home outside their conditions of registration. This is an offence under the Care Standards Act 2015, the inspection notes. Achieve Care Homes has been contacted for comment. A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We continue to work with Ofsted – as the regulator of children’s homes – to assess the situation at the Achieve Care Home in Bolton and ensure the children are being kept safe. “Any institution seeking to register an independent school must meet the independent school standards and the secretary of state must be satisfied that they are likely to do so, considering any available evidence to make a decision. There is no live application from the company in question to set up an independent school.”",News/Society,Bolton children’s home shut down for ‘serious and widespread failures’,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/15/bolton-childrens-home-shut-down-for-serious-and-widespread-failures
2/16/2022,"Tiger Roll, the Grand National winner in 2018 and 2019, has been ruled out of an attempt to equal Red Rum’s record of three Aintree victories in April after the 12-year-old was handed a rating of 161 for this year’s race when the weights were published on Tuesday in Liverpool. Michael O’Leary, Tiger Roll’s owner, has strongly criticised the weight allotted to his horse in the past two seasons and ran him in a Grade One contest at level weights at the Grand National meeting last year in preference to the big race.  Despite a 5lb drop in the ratings from last year’s mark, O’Leary issued a statement soon after the weights had been published, which again included fierce criticism of Martin Greenwood, the British Horseracing Authority’s senior chase handicapper. “Tiger Roll is now 12 years old,” the statement said. “He is clearly not as good as he was at eight or nine, and yet the UK handicapper now rates him 2lb higher than his 159 rating in April 2019, when he won both the Boyne Hurdle and the Aintree Grand National. “This rating is absurd, and unfair on a 12-year-old chaser. It is a pity that the handicapper won’t give Tiger Roll either a fair rating or a fair weight in the Aintree Grand National, where he could at least try to emulate Red Rum’s three wins.” The statement added: “Since we are responsible for the welfare of Tiger Roll, we must protect him from the idiotic opinion of this handicapper. We therefore regret to announce that he will not run in the year’s Aintree Grand National. “Instead, Tiger Roll will be trained for the cross-country race in Cheltenham [on 16 March] and there is every likelihood that win, lose or draw, this will be his last racecourse appearance. He will then return home for his well-earned retirement for the rest of his days. “It’s sadly clear from his ratings that this handicapper doesn’t want Tiger Roll to run in this year’s Grand National, he won’t give him a fair chance and sadly the race will be poorer for his absence.” Greenwood had earlier told a ceremony to mark the publication of the National weights that he had “relented a bit with Tiger Roll” while also pointing out “you can’t just ignore his win in the Cross-Country Chase at Cheltenham last season, which was less than 12 months ago, when he easily defeated two good horses in Easysland and Some Neck”. In Tiger Roll’s apparent absence, Minella Times will be the only previous National winner in this year’s field, with Rachael Blackmore hope to repeat her historic victory in front of empty stands last season – but this time with 80,000 spectators in attendance. “He’s been a little disappointing this season but I know Henry [de Bromhead, his trainer] will get him there in tip-top shape,” Blackmore said on Tuesday. “It’s going to be unbelievable to have the crowds back,. We had them at the Dublin Racing Festival the other week and I forgot how special it was to have people there. I don’t think last year could have been any better but having crowds back is going to be massive.” Any Second Now, Snow Leopardess and Escaria Ten head the early market for the Grand National on 16-1, while Minella Times is 25-1 to repeat last year’s success.",Sport/Sport,Tiger Roll out of Grand National after Aintree weights are revealed,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/15/tiger-roll-racing-grand-national-aintree-weights-michael-oleary
2/16/2022,"The Metropolitan Museum of Art has announced its latest fashion exhibition, which will be a follow up to In America: A Lexicon of Fashion. In America: An Anthology of Fashion will look at the genesis of American style, focusing on the nineteenth century to the later part of the 20th century. Opening in May at the New York art museum, it will provide the theme and dress code for the Met Gala this year.  If the focus sounds academic, the exhibition is sponsored by Instagram and the presentation of over 100 items brings a modern, social media-friendly lens. Eight different films directors – including Tom Ford, Sofia Coppola and Judy Dash, who directed 1991’s influential Daughters of the Dust – will create three-dimensional cinematic “freeze frames” featuring the clothes. Rather than a sterile white-walled gallery, these will be set up in the period rooms of the museum – which range from a nineteenth-century parlour to a living room designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Andrew Bolton, the head curator of the Met’s Costume Institute, explained that the focus was on designers and dressmakers who were not household names, those who had become “the footnotes in the annals of fashion history”. “It is through these largely hidden stories that a nuanced picture of American fashion comes into focus,” he said, “one in which the sum of its parts are as significant as the whole.” This exhibition is designed to give these forgotten talents a long-overdue spotlight. They include Ann Lowe, the African American designer who learned dressmaking from her grandmother and went on to make Jacqueline Bouvier’s wedding dress to marry John F Kennedy in 1953, and Elizabeth Hawes, a kind of Elsa Schiaparelli of America. A 1937 dress displayed here – which Hawes called ‘The Tart’s Dress’ – featured arrows pointing to its wearer’s breasts and bottom. In addition to this, gowns by Charles James, Halston and Stephen Burrows will be displayed. Six case studies of specific items will provide talking points too. They include a jacket thought to be worn by George Washington to his inauguration in 1789, and two Brooks Brothers items – one worn by Abraham Lincoln, the other a livery worn by a an unidentified enslaved man, from around 1857-65. There has been some criticism around In America: A Lexicon of Fashion since it opened in September. Korina Emmerich, who has an outfit included in the exhibition, spoke out about the fact that she was the only indigenous designer included. “I’m half-white and urban – I didn’t grow up on the reservation. I know I’m more palatable in situations like this,” she told The Cut. “But there are people who have been doing couture for a lot longer than I have, celebrated elders in our community.” Emmerich‘s outfit was a protest – the stripes reference those on the Hudson Bay blanket that were given out or traded to indigenous people, and spread smallpox among their population. In America: A Lexicon of Fashion displayed this outfit next to one using similar stripes by Andre Walker. While the captions explain the problematic history around these stripes and Emmerich‘a intentions, Walker’s design is labelled ‘comfort’. When the Met shared Walker’s cape on Instagram in September, with the caption “This cape by André Walker will represent the qualities of warmth and comfort” it received a backlash. “A symbol of genocide and colonialism, not warmth and comfort,” read one comment. The Lexicon exhibition will run concurrently with Anthology. Bolton said 30 more garments will be added to the current exhibition at the end of March, focusing on new designers. “These additions will reflect the vitality and diversity of contemporary American fashion,” a press release said.",Lifestyle/Fashion,New York’s Met announces second exhibition on American fashion,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/feb/15/new-yorks-met-announces-second-exhibition-on-american-fashion
2/16/2022,"The deadly impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the most deprived areas in England and Wales has been even more pronounced than first thought, according to research that reveals the north-west lost three times more years of life than the south-west. Deaths have been unevenly distributed socioeconomically and geographically ever since the crisis began. However, until now, the full scale of inequalities has been underestimated, a study published in the journal PLOS Medicine suggests.  Comparing the number of deaths during the pandemic with data from previous years can shed light on its impact, researchers said, but looking at excess deaths alone underestimates years of life lost and does not account for the differences in ages at which people die in different social groups. In the new study, led by the University of Manchester, researchers measured years of life lost attributable to the pandemic – directly or indirectly, as well as excess deaths. Years of life lost is a strong measure of premature mortality because it takes into account both the number of deaths and the age at which they occur. The findings of the new analysis are striking, researchers say, and suggest the true toll of the pandemic has been even deadlier in poorer areas than initially thought. “The impact of the pandemic, when quantified using years of life lost, was higher than previously thought on the most deprived areas of England and Wales, widening pre-existing health inequalities,” said Evangelos Kontopantelis, who led the research. Between March and December 2020, 1,645 years of life were lost per 100,000 of the population in the most deprived areas of England and Wales. In the most affluent areas, 916 years of life were lost per 100,000 people. The figures mean that almost twice as many years of life were lost in the very poorest areas of the country compared with the wealthiest. Broken down by geographic region, the highest rate was found in the north-west, where 1,550 years of life were lost per 100,000 of the population. The north-east (1,519) was the second worst hit area, followed by the West Midlands (1,475). The lowest rate was in the south-west, where 490 years of life were lost per 100,000 of the population. Next was the south central region (735), followed by the east of England (779). Stark inequalities were also found when examining excess deaths, especially in younger age groups, the researchers said. There were 11 times as many excess deaths in deprived areas compared with the most affluent areas in 15- to 44-year-olds, three times as many in 45- to 64-year-olds, and almost twice as many in 65- to 74-year-olds. Excess deaths were 40% higher in 75- to 84-year-olds living in the most deprived areas compared with the least. “Inequalities between socioeconomic and geographic groups resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic are more pronounced than previously reported,” the researchers wrote. They added that future plans to manage pandemics should include an understanding of regional and socioeconomic variation in years of life lost and how this has exacerbated long-standing health inequalities. Hannah Davies, of the Northern Health Science Alliance, who was not involved with the research, said the study was further evidence of “how devastating the impact of Covid-19 has been” in communities in the north of England that were already suffering from deprivation before the pandemic. Clare Bambra, a professor of public health at the University of Newcastle, added: “These findings reiterate that the pandemic has been very unequal – people in our most deprived communities have suffered most.”",News/World news,Covid impact in poorer areas of England and Wales ‘worse than first thought’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/15/covid-impact-in-poorer-areas-of-england-and-wales-worse-than-first-thought
2/16/2022,"The family of the late cinematographer Halyna Hutchins has filed a lawsuit against actor Alec Baldwin and other members of the film Rust, alleging that reckless behavior and cost-cutting led to Hutchins’ wrongful death on set.  Hutchins, a 42-year-old film veteran, was shot and killed on 21 October last year while preparing for a scene at the Bonanza Creek Ranch outside Santa Fe, New Mexico, when a gun held by Baldwin accidentally went off, in an incident that shocked Hollywood and prompted a reckoning over production safety and the use of weapons on set. Baldwin has since said in an emotional interview with ABC News that he believed the gun to be safe and did not pull the trigger. “Someone is responsible for what happened, and I can’t say who that is, but it’s not me,” Baldwin said. The bullet from Baldwin’s gun struck Hutchins in the torso and lodged in the shoulder of the director, Joel Souza. Hutchins was airlifted to a hospital in Albuquerque, where she died. She is survived by her husband, Matthew Hutchins, and a nine-year-old son. The suit also names seven producers as defendants – Ryan Smith, Allen Cheney, Nathan Klingher, Ryan Winterstern, Anjul Nigam, Matthew DelPiano and Emily Salveson – as well as crew members Sarah Zachry, Dave Halls, Hannah Gutierrez Reed, Gabrielle Pickle and Seth Kenney, among others. “We’re used to people coming in from out of town to play cowboy who don’t know how to use guns,” said Randi McGinn, the estate’s attorney in Albuquerque. “You don’t hand somebody a gun until you give them safety training … No one should ever die with a real gun on a make-believe movie set.” The Santa Fe sheriff’s office has been investigating the incident, and determined that Gutierrez Reed, the film’s inexperienced 24-year-old armorer and key prop assistant, loaded the Colt .45 with what she believed were dummy rounds, then gave the gun to Halls, the first assistant director. Halls declared “cold gun” before handing the weapon to Baldwin. Gutierrez has since sued Kenney, who supplied ammunition to the set, alleging that he supplied a mislabeled box of live ammunition. Three other crew members have also filed suit: Mamie Mitchell, the script supervisor; Serge Svetnoy, the gaffer; and Cherlyn Schaefer, the key medic. In response to the lawsuit, the film’s producers, including Baldwin, say the case should be thrown out because it involves a workplace accident, and thus should go through the state’s worker compensation system.",News/US news,Family of Halyna Hutchins sues Alec Baldwin over Rust film set shooting,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/15/halyna-hutchins-family-sues-alec-baldwin-rust-shooting
2/16/2022,"It was always going to come to this. Prince Andrew’s American lawyer’s statement in New York this afternoon announcing the agreed settlement with Virginia Giuffre sets the seal on the prince’s humiliation over his association with the convicted sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein and his friend, the woman who procured girls for him, Ghislaine Maxwell. It has cost the prince his much-prized royal position on palace balconies, his perks – all those helicopter flights to golf matches at public expense, all those private flights across the world to shake hands with sheikhs – and all his military ranks, titles and honorifics. No more honorary colonelcies: colonel of the Grenadier Guards, commodore-in-chief of the Fleet Air Arm, to say nothing of the colonelcy of the New Zealand Army Logistic Regiment and the Princess Louise Fusiliers of Canada. All gone. Strangely, he remains a vice-admiral, but the full admiral title will now for ever elude him. He may be a duke, but he is no longer an HRH. The retreat is complete.  Perhaps the mystery is why it has taken so long. But Andrew has always been cloth-eared about public opinion. The tales of his private boorishness are common, but his insouciance and disdain for what others thought, most obviously on display in his disastrous television interview with Emily Maitlis in November 2019 – which he characteristically thought he’d handled rather well – meant that he has been slow to wake up not only to what was happening to his own reputation, but to its disastrous effect on the monarchy itself. No wonder they’ve cut him off and he’s left dependent at the age of 61 on Mummy’s largesse. She’ll be doubtless paying for the settlement too. It was perhaps unwise to rely on famously aggressive lawyers on both sides of the Atlantic too, but who knows the extent to which he followed their advice. Perhaps they were cowed by his princely majesty, though that seems a trifle unlikely given the their hard-faced New York reputation. Only yesterday they were demanding the original of the photograph of Andrew with his arm around the teenaged Giuffre’s waist while Maxwell grinned wolfishly in the background, so that they could apparently test its authenticity. Now, fortunately, Andrew will not have his day in court. He’s run out of road. Someone must finally have seen sense. Prince Andrew – for all his denials, and with no admission of liability – was nevertheless bunkered. He was never going to win. And now his stupidity and arrogance has cost him almost everything he values. His mother could have told him that a sense of duty and public service – the monarchy’s not-so secret weapon – has kept the family publicly respected and on the throne for generations. She has a jubilee year to mark, which may still be blighted by his very public disgrace, but perhaps now less so. For him, the future will be anything but celebratory. A stain on his reputation, and that of the institution. A stain that may never go away.

2/16/2022,"A gunmaker has been held liable for a mass shooting in the United States for the first time after Remington Arms agreed to pay $73m to the families of five adults and four children killed in the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre. Twenty students and six adults were killed on 14 December 2012 in Newtown, Connecticut, by Adam Lanza, who used a Remington Bushmaster AR-15 rifle to shoot his way into the school after killing his mother at home.  Remington Arms will pay $73m to the families and release all the discovery and deposition material to the public, attorneys for the families said on Tuesday. The settlement will be paid through insurance policies. The nine families sued in 2014 and spent years in the courts trying to hold Remington liable, despite a US law that protects firearm manufacturers and dealers from most civil litigation. In 2019 the supreme court decided against taking up an appeal by Remington, allowing the lawsuit to move forward. Last summer, Remington proposed a settlement worth approximately $33m to the families, who refused “because they wanted to ensure they had obtained enough documents and taken enough depositions to prove Remington’s misconduct” and to “ensure the case’s message to the insurance industry was clear”, attorneys said in a statement on Tuesday. The families have “obtained and can make public thousands of pages of internal company documents that prove Remington’s wrongdoing and carry important lessons for helping to prevent future mass shootings”, the statement said. “They had the energy, drive and motivation to do one thing,” said Josh Koskoff, an attorney for the families. “That was to do whatever they could so that other families … would not have to go through the pain and loss that they have.” He added: “This victory should serve as a wake-up call not only to the gun industry, but also the insurance and banking companies that prop it up.” The Sandy Hook families found a way around the legal protection for gunmakers by claiming that Remington’s marketing of firearms contributed to the massacre. Attorneys argued that Remington violated Connecticut’s state trade law by irresponsibly targeting its AR-15 Bushmaster rifle at young, high-risk males through militaristic marketing campaigns and first-person shooter video games. Despite the settlement, the parents of six-year-old Noah Pozner, who was killed in the shooting, said they do not completely feel that justice has been served. Lenny Pozner and Veronique De La Rosa said their loss is “irreversible, and in that sense, this outcome is neither redemptive nor restorative”, according to CNN. “One moment we had this dazzling, energetic six-year-old little boy, and the next all we had left, were echoes of the past, photographs of a lost boy who will never grow older, calendars marking a horrifying new anniversary, a lonely grave, and pieces of Noah’s life stored in a backpack and boxes. “What is lost remains forever. However, the resolution does provide a measure of accountability in an industry that has thus far operated with impunity. For this we are grateful,” they said. Other gun control advocates have since been encouraged to follow the Sandy Hook families’ strategy of looking at gunmaker’s marketing techniques, including New Jersey’s attorney general, who is investigating marketing by Smith & Wesson. Mexico also filed a US lawsuit last year seeking $10bn from several gunmakers, accusing them of marketing their weapons to the country’s underworld. New York last year enacted a law that allows firearm sellers, manufacturers and distributors to be sued for creating a “public nuisance” that endangers the public’s safety and health. Gun manufacturers have challenged the law in court. Gun groups have also been using the courts and state legislatures to expand gun rights, and scored victories at the supreme court in 2008 and 2010 that solidified an individual’s right to keep a gun at home for self-defense.",News/US news,Sandy Hook families reach $73m settlement with gun manufacturer,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/15/sandy-hook-families-settlement-gun-manufacturer-remington
2/16/2022,"A little sibling rivalry is common in most families. But within a family of aviators, one child aiming to beat a world record held by their sibling could be seen to be taking it to the next level. Mack Rutherford, a 16-year-old British-Belgian pilot, will begin his attempt to become the youngest person to fly across the world solo in a small plane on 17 March.  Rutherford’s parents are both pilots, and his 19-year-old sister, Zara, made history by becoming the youngest woman to fly across the world in January. She also became the youngest person to circumnavigate the world in a microlight, a Guinness world record her brother will break if he completes his attempt. Flying has been a passion of the younger Rutherford sibling since he was eight, frequently accompanying his father and flying with him. At 15 he became the youngest pilot in the world after qualifying for his pilot licence in July 2020. Rutherford said he always wanted to do something special with his flying career, but it wasn’t until his sister made history that he knew he wanted to attempt the same. “I definitely think a lot of my inspiration for wanting to fly across the world comes from my sister,” he said. If his attempt succeeds, he will also become the youngest male to fly solo across the world, a record currently held by Travis Ludlow, who completed the feat in 2021 at 18. His journey will begin in Bulgaria, from where he will fly south to Africa, visiting countries including Madagascar and Mauritius. Next he will head north to Oman, crossing Russia, before heading to the US, Iceland, the UK, and then finishing his journey back in Bulgaria. Rutherford’s mother, Beatrice De Smet, said she had reservations when her son told her what he wanted to do. “When Mack first told us that he wanted to fly across the world, I said: ‘No way.’ I didn’t want to hear about it because I thought he was too young.” She didn’t change her mind until he wrote her a letter outlining how it was his passion to set the record. As a pilot herself, the one piece of advice she would give to her son is to always make sure he is confident in his abilities before setting off. “Never go if you don’t feel confident, for whatever reason,” she said. Although Rutherford was looking forward to beginning his journey, there was still trepidation at the prospect of what truly flying solo at such a young age entailed. “I’m really quite excited, but obviously I’m quite nervous, particularly for long overseas journeys,” he said. “For one of my flights, I have to fly about eight hours over the ocean, and so if something goes wrong there isn’t much I can do. But I trust in my aircraft wholeheartedly.” Rutherford will be flying in a Shark, one of the fastest ultralight aircrafts in the world with a cruising speed of up to 300km/h. It is the same aircraft his sister used for her record-breaking journey. The aircraft has been specially prepared for long journeys, and the trip is being sponsored by the web hosting company ICDSoft, which has loaned him the plane. Balancing school-work with attempting this record-breaking feat is also something Rutherford has had to consider. Currently studying for A-levels in history, economics and biology, he said: “I’ve definitely had to ask teachers to extend homework for a few days, but they’ve supported me wholeheartedly.”",News/UK news,Teenage pilot aims to break sister’s round-the-world solo flight record,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/15/teenage-pilot-aims-to-break-sisters-round-the-world-solo-flight-record
2/16/2022,"Boris Johnson has said the UK is not yet convinced by Russia’s announcement that it was withdrawing troops from the borders of Ukraine, adding: “The intelligence we are seeing is not encouraging.” Speaking shortly after an emergency mid-morning Cobra meeting on Tuesday, the prime minister said there “mixed signals” coming from Moscow, while other ministers and officials warned Russian troop numbers were still increasing.  “We’ve got Russian field hospitals being constructed near the border with Ukraine in Belarus [that] only can be construed as preparation for an invasion,” Johnson said. “You’ve got more [Russian] battalion tactical groups actually been brought closer to the border with Ukraine, according to the intelligence that we’re seeing.” The cautious British assessment contrasts with Russian defence ministry statements that it is withdrawing troops from is southern and western military districts, supported by footage that appeared to be shot in Crimea. In a conference call with MPs, Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, said Russian forces – estimated at 150,000 – were if anything stepping up, not down. The Kremlin needed to be “judged by its actions”, the minister stressed. Other western officials were in line with his remarks. “We see no sign of Russian de-escalation,” they said. “We see the opposite.” They said there was continuing concern that the Kremlin would manufacture a pretext to justify a military intervention. Nevertheless, Johnson also said “we are seeing a Russia openness to conversations” and that “we think there is an avenue for diplomacy”, based on remarks coming from the Kremlin. On Monday, Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, told Vladimir Putin to continue and expand negotiations with the west. Reflecting on that and similar exchanges, Johnson said: “We are seeing mixed signals.” Britain’s embassy in Kyiv will be kept open, Johnson said, in contrast with the US announcement made on Monday night to relocate all its embassy staff and operations to Lviv in the west of Ukraine. The prime minister said: “One of the things we want to do is to show the UK’s continued support for Ukraine, for stability in Ukraine – and I believe that keeping our embassy going for as long as possible is an important symbol.” The Cobra meeting reviewed the security situation. On Monday, it emerged that Britain believed that Russia was in the process of sending thousands more troops to the borders of Ukraine, with another 14 battalions to join the 100 already positioned near its neighbour. Ministers fear that an attack directed at Kyiv could still take place at any moment. But some analysts are unsure that Russia has the capability to hold what is likely to be a hostile country. Henry Boyd, from the International Institute of Strategic Studies, said there was a difference between “a large scale military offensive and an invasion and occupation of the whole country”. He added: “I think the ability of Russia conducting the former is reasonably certain. Its ability to successfully conduct the latter is much more questionable.” Johnson repeated that an economic crime bill would be brought forward in the next session of parliament – a commitment that had briefly been dropped, prompting the resignation of the Lords Treasury minister, Theodore Agnew. The prime minister also committed to introducing registers that would spell out the beneficial ownership of luxury properties and businesses in the UK, as part of the legislation. The planned measure, he said, would be to “open up the Matryoshka doll if you like” to reveal “who really owns the companies that we’re talking about, who really owns the properties that we’re talking about”.

2/16/2022,"The worst of Storm Dudley should have passed over Teesside by the time England kick off against Canada on Thursday night but Sarina Wiegman’s players must remain braced for a potentially hurricane-force challenge. After scoring 53 goals – including 20 in one game against Latvia – during six successive wins over modest opposition since Wiegman took charge last September, the Lionesses face their first real test at Middlesbrough’s Riverside Stadium.  An Olympic gold medal-winning Canada managed by Bev Priestman – previously England’s No 2 under Phil Neville – represent the first of three tough games in the inaugural Arnold Clark Cup. Played across six days in a round-robin format as Wiegman’s squad prepare to host the European Championship this summer, the tournament also features a Germany side ranked third in the world (England stand eighth) and a Spain team heavily staffed by key components of Barcelona’s Champions League-winning XI. The good news for Wiegman is that she is able to work with arguably her best player for the first time since swapping coaching the Netherlands for England. Lucy Bronze is ready to start against Canada after missing the first half of this season because of knee surgery. “My match fitness and my performances are coming back so hopefully I can get back to the very top of my game in the next months,” said the Manchester City right-back, speaking from England’s borrowed base at Middlesbrough’s Rockliffe Park training ground near Darlington. “This is the first time we’ve played high-ranked opposition with Sarina as our manager and our new way of playing so it’s a good test.” Bronze is determined to make up for lost time after a “frustrating” few months spent recovering from the fifth knee operation of her career. By way of complication, this latest problem was so rare her surgeon had performed the procedure only twice before. “I played a whole year injured and wasn’t at my best before the surgery so it’s nice to be back,” the Northumberland-born former Sunderland and Lyon full-back said. “And it’s also nice to be back in the north east – even if it’s colder than Manchester.” The 30-year-old is enjoying her crash course in Wiegman’s tactical thought process. “I’ve missed the last three camps so we’re playing catchup; I’m trying to get to know her quite quickly,” Bronze said. “But the team’s playing with a lot of energy – we want to win the ball back quickly and score a lot of goals.” Arsenal’s Leah Williamson will continue as captain in Steph Houghton’s absence.",Sport/Football,Lucy Bronze back and eager for first real test of Sarina Wiegman’s England,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/15/lucy-bronze-back-and-eager-for-first-real-test-of-sarina-wiegmans-england
2/16/2022,"Amid the gloom of February and the cost-of-living crisis, there are at least some reasons to be cheerful when it comes to coronavirus in the UK. Vaccinations have saved countless lives and allowed people to return to many of the activities they missed. The Omicron variant did not lead to the rocketing rates of hospitalisation and death initially feared, and infection and mortality rates are declining again. The desire to return to pre-pandemic life is natural – a reaction to the sacrifices made and, more generally, to the exhaustion and emotional toll of the past two years. People are tired of thinking about Covid. But the best hope of maximising our freedoms is to rigorously monitor the spread of infection and enable people to protect themselves and others. The government appears set on dismantling the very things that make this possible.  Last Wednesday, Boris Johnson announced abruptly that he plans to end all domestic Covid regulations from next week, including the requirement to self-isolate on testing positive. The prime minister was led by Tory backbench instincts, not science, or even popular demand; fewer than one in five support the change. Though his spokesman subsequently said that “we would never recommend anyone goes to work when they have an infectious disease”, many will be genuinely confused by the messaging, and less scrupulous bosses will press infected people back to work – at a time when deaths are still averaging more than 175 a day. The lack of adequate sick pay already means that some workers cannot afford to stay home. Problems will be further exacerbated by the proposals to phase out free testing, at least for all but the most vulnerable and for high-risk settings. The better-off will still be able to minimise the risk to their loved ones or co-workers; the poorer will have to take their chances. It cannot be in the best interests of the economy for sick workers to infect colleagues and customers. Short-term savings must be set against the impact of sickness on businesses, the costs of long Covid and the setbacks in tackling hospital backlogs that are likely to result. Even worse is the threat to prematurely end the Office for National Statistics surveillance survey on Covid – genuinely world-class research. In the words of Stephen Reicher, a member of the Sage subcommittee advising on behavioural science, this is “like switching off the radar before the Battle of Britain was finished”. Critical data on the prevalence of infection and emergence of mutations will be unavailable, and less will be known about the long-term impact. Experts will be less well equipped to monitor the pandemic, and individuals less able to make informed choices in weighing up risks. The clinically vulnerable, in particular, will be stranded further from normal life; for them, this means much less freedom, not more. The Treasury’s eagerness to save pennies and the prime minister’s need to buy support mean that the UK is jettisoning essential tools too early. Proper monitoring and support for people to stay at home when infectious, as well as encouraging masking and ensuring better ventilation, are crucial. Better support for the global vaccination drive is also essential to reduce the risk of new variants emerging. We all long to reach the other side of the pandemic and we hope that we can at last glimpse it. Shutting our eyes is the worst way to navigate there.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on axing Covid rules and testing: this is not normal | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/15/the-guardian-view-on-axing-covid-rules-and-testing-this-is-not-normal
2/16/2022,"Pay growth in the UK continued to lag behind inflation in December as households faced the biggest fall in living standards in three decades. Average weekly pay, excluding bonuses, fell in real terms, according to official figures. The Guardian spoke to workers and employers about the pressure to keep up with inflation.  Paul de Savary has raised pay to recruit and retain staff at the care home provider he runs in Lincolnshire. With shortages of staff in the sector nationwide, the managing director of Home From Home Care has raised the firm’s wage bill by 20% in a year to avoid losing staff. “We saw a situation building in the summer where we were going to run out of staff if we weren’t careful. They were all going to hospitality and other sectors than care,” he said. The operator of 11 care homes, which has 450 staff and supports adults with learning difficulties and complex needs, has raised starting pay from the £8.91 national living wage to at least £10 an hour. This is above increased legal pay floor of £9.50 an hour due from April. However, the firm faces spiralling costs across the board, including for energy bills and insurance, and lacks the ability to pass on bumper prices to its customers owing to a lack of adequate government funding for social care. Still, de Savary said retaining staff was vital, even if at the expense of profitability in the short-term. “We were concerned about the cost of living for our staff,” he said. “If they’re worrying about things, we have to help them. They’re at the heart of everything we do.” “It seems to me like I’m just working to be able to cover the bills,” said Matthew Tovey. The 30-year-old from Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales, said his pay had not risen above inflation for a decade under the Conservatives’ austerity drive. Tovey, who uses his car to commute to work, has seen the cost of diesel rise sharply and is concerned that his pay packet will not keep up with the surge in gas and electricity bills due in April. “I’m quite fearful of how I’m going to manage,” he said. He said it felt as if NHS staff had been ignored despite being on the frontline of the pandemic. “I worked through three waves, and they stood on their doorsteps and clapped, but they’re taking food away from our tables, really.” Having gone to university to become a nurse, Tovey says he probably earns more than other people but is still struggling. “It feels like if I’ve worked hard and gone into a profession to better myself, and I’m in this position, how the hell are other people coping? “It impacts on your mental health, there’s nowhere to turn. You’re caught between a rock and a hard place and you wonder, when are we going to have a break?” The Luton-based electronics manufacturer Jaltek has found hiring staff tougher as Brexit barriers and Covid-19 have reduced the number of EU workers in Britain, while rising inflation has led the company to increase pay. “It’s a scarcity of people,” said Steve Blythe, the business manager at the family-owned company. “It’s an employees’ market. I think short-term that will put pressure on wages. It goes back to when Brexit happened. Some staff went back to Romania, Poland. These aren’t people who politicians would have you believe are low-paid and low-skilled. They have degrees in science and engineering and are on good money. It leaves you looking for a pool of people who are scarce in the UK.” The firm, which is a member of the Make UK trade body and builds electronics for cars, spacecraft and medical devices, is raising pay to compensate workers for higher rates of inflation, though this is made harder as inflation climbs more than expected. “When we looked at pay a month ago it’s a different picture to where we’re even at now. We have to monitor inflation keenly,” Blythe said.",News/Business,‘When will we have a break?’: the cost of growing inflation,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/15/when-will-we-have-a-break-the-cost-of-growing-inflation
2/16/2022,"Those who save the lives of others need protection themselves. At least 415 attacks against health workers and facilities have been carried out since last year’s coup in Myanmar, according to a report published recently. It has become one of the most dangerous places on Earth for medics, with half of all such global attacks in the first six months of last year. The war in Ethiopia’s Tigray region has seen the large-scale destruction of facilities. With the crisis deepening in Sudan, last month the UN reported 15 healthcare attacks since November. It is over a century and a half since the agreement of the first Geneva convention, an international prohibition on attacking the sick and wounded, assaulting or punishing those who offer them healthcare, and inflicting violence on hospitals and ambulances. Those protections have since been broadened and strengthened repeatedly.  Yet attacks on healthcare facilities and workers, often deliberately targeting them, have come to seem like a new normal, from the former Yugoslavia to Syria to Central African Republic. In 2019, at least 1,200 of these acts took place across 20 countries. Hatred, dehumanisation and genocidal thinking as well as the military demand for rapid victory have contributed. Sickeningly, measures meant to protect hospitals and clinics – such as giving their locations to combatants – have in the worst cases facilitated attacks on them. Accountability is vanishingly rare. When Human Rights Watch examined 25 major cases, it found that 16 involved potential war crimes. Just five cases saw a full investigation with published findings. In only one were soldiers disciplined. The Assads of this world are the most obvious culprits, but the US, UK and others are hardly without taint. In October 2015, a US attack on a hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, killed 42 civilians. Countries also bear responsibility when their partners and allies carry out attacks with the weapons they supply. They almost always seek to duck it: “The support by the US and UK for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen, and the rationalisations offered for it, is the quintessential example of this conduct,” writes Leonard Rubenstein, a human rights lawyer who has investigated many such atrocities, in his recent book Perilous Medicine. It would be easy to despair. Yet Mr Rubenstein argues that such attacks are now more likely to be reported and that global indifference shifted to attention in the last decade, though action remained limited. Campaigning by civil society and the medical community has had a measurable impact at times. Some governments have made improvements. In 2018, the World Health Organization introduced a system for monitoring and reporting attacks, though it has not proved as effective as anticipated. The International Committee of the Red Cross has brought together military representatives, armed groups, experts and healthcare workers to discuss pragmatic measures such as running checkpoints in a way that does not unduly interfere with medical care. We know what needs to be done. In 2016, the then UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, sent a detailed and lengthy set of recommendations for tackling the issue to the security council. Members took the opportunity to trade recriminations, but no action resulted. Even countries that pledged support failed to follow through, for example, by ensuring that domestic laws incorporate the Geneva conventions. Protecting healthcare is not an utterly hopeless task – but the ongoing attacks it faces show how desperately sustained effort is needed.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on healthcare in war: protect those who aid others | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/15/the-guardian-view-on-healthcare-in-war-protect-those-who-aid-others
2/16/2022,"Liz Truss has said she hopes Britain will soon be in a position to pay the £400m debt overdue to Iran, according to an Iranian account of the phone call between the foreign secretary and her Tehran counterpart, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian. UK government officials have been exploring legal ways to pay Britain’s historical debt, although international economic sanctions on Iran have made it difficult.  The UK Foreign Office did not proactively brief reporters on the call, but when contacted for comment it confirmed that the conversation had happened on Monday, saying: “We continue to explore options as a matter of urgency to resolve this case.” It said the UK had always been committed to paying the debt. With talks on the Iran nuclear deal reaching their decisive stage in Vienna, it is possible Truss wanted to stress the upside of both sides reaching a deal. The two countries insist that the £400m debt – dating back to the sale of tanks to the shah of Iran in the mid-1970s – has always been treated as independent of the Vienna talks and the fate of three British dual nationals held in Evin prison or, in the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, denied the right to leave Iran. The tone of the call, according to the Iranian account, appeared to have been warmer than for some time, with Iran eager to see the UK do more to help with the Afghan refugee crisis on its borders. According to Iran, Truss praised Tehran for housing as many as 2 million refugees. The foreign ministry said: “Amir-Abdollahian positively assessed the relations between the two countries.” It may have been significant that the Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, was in Tehran on Monday. He has acted as a conciliator on political prisoner issues in the past. In the UK parliament last month, Boris Johnson again blamed the threat of sanctions for the block on the payment. The Vienna talks will mean many of sanctions could be lifted, but it has been argued that the UK has been responsible for its own sanctions laws since Brexit and so could pay the debt now if it is not tied up in a wider negotiation.",News/Politics,Truss tells Iran she hopes UK will soon be able to repay £400m debt,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/15/iran-liz-truss-hopes-uk-soon-repay-debt
2/16/2022,"Vladimir Putin has confirmed a “partial” drawdown of Russian forces near the Ukrainian border, in a step that could begin a de-escalation of tensions but has left western officials sceptical that the Kremlin has ruled out an attack in the near future. The size of the withdrawal remains unclear and it may involve only a fraction of Russia’s forces at the border, which western officials estimate at more than 130,000 troops, at least 60% of the country’s ground forces.  Western officials said there were no immediate signs of a Russian drawdown. “So far we have not seen any de-escalation on the ground from the Russian side. Over the last weeks and days we have seen the opposite,” Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, said on Tuesday. Security officials said they had seen “reinforcements of combat and other capabilities close to the Ukraine border”. Russia has always denied planning to invade Ukraine, saying it can exercise troops on its own territory as it sees fit. It has been pressing for a set of security guarantees from the west, including a guarantee that Ukraine will never join Nato. Asked for the reason for the drawdown on Tuesday, Putin was not forthcoming. “It’s a partial withdrawal of troops from the areas of our exercises,” he said in response to a question during a press conference with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. “What is there to comment on?” In another sign of Russia turning the screw on Ukraine, the State Duma voted on Tuesday to ask Putin to recognise the independence of the two Russian-controlled separatist regions in the east of the country. Putin, hinting that he intended to use them as leverage, said he would not recognise the “republics” immediately, but called on Nato to negotiate with him on Russia’s security guarantees before it was “too late”. “We hear that Ukraine is not ready to join Nato; we know that,” Putin said. “At the same time, they say it’s not going to join tomorrow. But by the time they get ready for it, it may be too late for us. So we have to decide this question now, right now, in the very near future, we have to have a negotiation process for this.” The drawdown was first announced on Tuesday morning by the defence ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov, who described ongoing exercises that involved forces from “practically all military districts, fleets, and the airborne forces”. “Units of the southern and western military districts, which have accomplished their missions, are boarding trains and trucks and will head for their garrisons later today,” Konashenkov said. The defence ministry released video apparently shot in Crimea of Russian tanks and other heavy weaponry from two brigades being loaded on to railway cars. Otherwise, the Russian military gave little information about which forces would be withdrawn and where they would be sent. Nato’s Stoltenberg said: “We believe there is some ground for cautious optimism based on the signals and signs coming from Moscow, that they are ready to engage in a diplomatic effort and we are ready to continue to engage in a diplomatic effort.” Ukrainian officials said they would not take Moscow at its word about a drawdown. “Many statements are constantly being made from [Russia], so we have a rule: we’ll believe it when we see it,” said Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister. “If we see the withdrawal then we will believe in de-escalation.” The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov accused the west of manufacturing “manic information madness”. “We’ve always said the troops will return to their bases after the exercises are over. This is the case this time as well,” he said. Peskov said Putin had joked about US intelligence reports that he could give an order to launch an invasion as early as this week. “He asks [us] to find out if the exact time, to the hour, of the start of the war has been published. It’s impossible to be understanding of this manic information madness. Russian state media pundits rushed to praise Putin’s use of military pressure on the west. “Before, no one wanted to talk to us about security; now look at the line of those wanting to visit Moscow in February,” wrote the RT head, Margarita Simonyan, in an apparent reference to visits by leaders such as Scholtz and Emmanuel Macron. “At the same time, Kyiv’s economy has been torn to shreds … it’s a small thing but nice to see.” Russia’s rouble currency posted gains after the announcement, indicating that investors hoped this would mark the beginning of a de-escalation of tensions between Russia and the west. Scholz arrived in Moscow on Tuesday for meetings with Putin, the latest in a series of visits and phone calls from western leaders seeking to avert a potential war through negotiations. Putin said he was “ready to work further” with the west on how to de-escalate the crisis on the Ukrainian border, while Germany’s chancellor said the diplomatic channels were “not yet exhausted”, at a joint press conference marked by subtle swipes and simmering historical resentment. “We are ready to work further together, we are ready to go down the negotiations track,” said Putin, who denied that his country was seeking an invasion of Ukraine. “As to whether we want [war]: of course not. That’s why we have made these proposals about negotiations, the results of which should be an agreement about equal security for all countries, including ours.” The US and other western countries have called a Russian drawdown of its troops on the border a precondition for successful negotiations on the Kremlin’s demands for “security guarantees”. Russia has previously announced the conclusion of military exercises near the Ukrainian border, but social media and satellite photography taken in the following days have not shown considerable changes to Russia’s force posture. Those exercises involved only a small number of troops. Many of the troops located close to the Ukrainian border are not involved in any formal training. When questioned on the buildup, Russia has said it has the right to move troops as it wishes within its own territory. Russia is holding large joint exercises with Belarus scheduled to end on 20 February. Western countries have said those drills could be used as cover to prepare for an attack on Ukraine, while Russia has said the troops will return to base once the exercises have concluded. On Tuesday, Russia also deployed MiG-31K fighter jets and long-range Tupolev Tu-22M strategic bombers to its air base in Syria for naval exercises, Interfax news agency reported.

2/16/2022,"Authorities are monitoring parts of the north Wales coast for an oil slick after hydrocarbons were released into the sea following a pipeline failure. The pipeline, which connects two oil installations in the Irish Sea, had a failure about 20 miles from the north Wales coast. According to Eni UK, the company that operates the pipeline, the incident involved less than 500 barrels and was reported on Monday.  The company confirmed that hydrocarbons had been released from its pipeline running between Conwy and Douglas oil installations, sparking fears of an oil slick. It said: “Eni UK Ltd can confirm that a release of hydrocarbons from its pipeline between the Conwy and Douglas installations, approximately 33km from the north Wales coast, was reported on Monday 14 February.” It said the details of the incident were still being confirmed but the “Conwy to Douglas line was shut immediately and remains off”. It added: “All relevant authorities were promptly informed. There was no impact at any personnel on the installations. A further statement will be made as soon as more information becomes available.” A spokesperson for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said it was monitoring Eni UK’s response and assisting local authorities. News of the spill came on the 26th anniversary of what has been called Wales’ worst ecological disaster, when 72,000 tonnes of crude spilled from the Sea Empress oil tanker off the Pembrokeshire coast. Large numbers of seaweeds and invertebrates were killed on the beaches where it drifted ashore, and it took over a year to clean the slick. Doug Parr, the chief scientist for Greenpeace UK, said: “This week marks the anniversary of the Sea Empress oil spill. A quarter of a century on, we still find that oil is a dirty business at every stage, whether that’s through planet-warming emissions or leakages like this that harm marine life. The ongoing environmental damage oil causes should be a major incentive to drive forward the cleaner, cheaper energy technologies that now exist.” Dr Richard Benwell, the CEO of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: “It’s 26 years to the day since the Sea Empress disaster wrought ecological havoc on the Welsh coast … Fossil fuel spills are again threatening the wildlife in our waters, which are already in a precarious state. The sooner we break our dependence on these dirty fuels the better.”",News/UK news,North Wales coast is monitored after oil pipeline spillage,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/15/north-wales-coast-is-monitored-after-oil-pipeline-spillage
2/16/2022,"Andriy, a 34-year-old bank clerk living in Kyiv, was feeling very pleased with the announcement on Tuesday that some Russian troops had started to move away from the border with Ukraine. First, it seemed to lower the threat of an all-out Russian attack on Kyiv. And second, it meant he might win a bet with his sister.  Most locals are going about their lives as normal. “She took a plane to Poland on Saturday with her kids because she was reading about all this war threat, but I didn’t believe in it, and also I wanted to stay because had a haircut booked,” he said, as he took a stroll in the sunshine on the central Khreshchatyk street on Tuesday afternoon. “We had a bet about whether the Russians would attack,” he said. In recent days, many Kyiv residents, while alarmed by the military buildup, have shared Andriy’s scepticism about American warnings that their lives were about to be disrupted by missile barrages and that tank incursions would come to pass. The reports of US diplomats destroying equipment and shredding documents at the embassy in Kyiv before fleeing the capital, reminiscent of desperate scrambles to evacuate burning cities on the brink of capture, have sat strangely with the atmosphere of calm in most of the Ukrainian capital over recent days. On Monday evening, bars and restaurants were full of couples enjoying Valentine’s Day dates. During the day on Tuesday, the streets were busy with people going about their daily business. “Kyiv is calm. National currency stable. Restaurants and supermarkets full. The absence of diplomats is compensated by abundance of journalists,” wrote Olexander Scherba, a former Ukrainian diplomat, on Twitter. Indeed, the world’s newspaper and television crews have descended on Kyiv in recent weeks, awaiting the Russian assault threatened by Putin’s massed troops and promised by White House briefings. The Russian announcement on Tuesday that some troops were being withdrawn from the border appeared to make that maximal outcome less likely, though the Ukrainian government is not relaxing yet. The foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, wrote on Twitter: “We in Ukraine have a rule: we don’t believe what we hear, we believe what we see. If a real withdrawal follows these statements, we will believe in the beginning of a real de-escalation.” But even if the withdrawal does continue, news on Tuesday evening of a potential hacking attack against several Ukrainian banks and the website of the ministry of defence was a reminder that Russia’s long, hybrid grind against Ukraine has been going on for some time and is likely to continue. This kind of messy, piecemeal attack is what Ukrainian leaders have always believed to be more likely than the all-out war scenario briefed by the White House. Underneath the calm of recent days, plenty of Kyiv residents have been making contingency plans, as local television news bulletins have drummed home the possibility of Russian action. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitaly Klitschko, said on Monday the city was working to ensure that power, heating and water supplies would be uninterrupted in the case of a military incursion. His administration released a map showing 4,500 possible bomb shelters for use in case of an attack on Kyiv. They included shops, bars, metro stations – and in one case, a strip club – all of which have promised to shelter people in the event of airstrikes. Some people have bought water and food supplies in case they get stuck at home for days. While many foreign diplomats have been sent home or evacuated to Lviv, in the west of the country, many foreign residents of Kyiv have decided to ignore apocalyptic warnings from their embassies to leave Ukraine immediately. “I’m staying for now, this is a massive city, even if the Russians do start something, I just can’t see it getting too dangerous to stay here,” said Bryan, a 48-year-old American businessman who has been living in Kyiv for the past four years. “I find it a bit strange that our diplomats fled so quickly. That embassy is like a fortress; surely they have somewhere secure to be there,” he added.",News/World news,Kyiv starts to breathe a little easier as Russian troops pull back,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/15/kyiv-starts-to-breathe-a-little-easier-as-russian-troops-pull-back
2/16/2022,"At least seven people have died and 17 are missing after a Spanish fishing boat sank in bitterly cold seas off the north-east coast of Canada early on Tuesday morning. Spain’s maritime rescue service said an international operation was under way to locate the crew of the Villa de Pitanxo, a boat from the north-western Galicia region that went down 280 miles (450km) off the Newfoundland coast.  Three people have been plucked from a life raft and seven bodies have been recovered in a search operation that has been hindered by wind, rough seas and reduced visibility. “An air and sea operation has been launched to rescue the 24 crew members of the Villa de Pitanxo fishing vessel, a 50-metre-long fishing boat that operates from Marín, in Pontevedra,” it said. “The crew is made up of 16 Spaniards, five Peruvians and three Ghanaians.” A plane, two helicopters and four boats are combing the area for survivors. Canadian rescuers said they were optimistic, despite the bad weather. “The fact that we have already found three survivors in a life raft gives us that hope that others were able to either get into their survival suits, get into life rafts and get off the vessel,” Brian Owens, of Canada’s Joint Rescue Coordination Centre, told AFP. The centre added: “The search continues for the remaining crew and we hold out hope that we will find them. We will update as soon as more information becomes available.” It said the Villa de Pitanxo sent out a distress signal just after midnight local time on Tuesday. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said the government was in constant contact with the rescue services. “We’re following the search and rescue effort for the crew of the Galician boat that sank off Newfoundland with worry and concern,” Sánchez tweeted. “All my love to their families.” Alberto Núñez Feijóo, the regional president of Galicia, also said his thoughts were with the families of the crew. “We’re following the terrible news that has reached us from Canada of the sinking of the Villa de Pitanxo, a boat from Marín,” he said, adding that the regional government was ready to do whatever it could to help.",News/World news,Seven dead and 17 missing as Spanish fishing boat sinks off Canada,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/15/dead-and-missing-as-spanish-fishing-boat-sinks-off-canada
2/16/2022,"Uefa has been accused of exposing supporters to “crypto-mercenaries” after becoming the latest football organisation to sign a deal with the fan token company Socios.com. The European governing body has agreed a licensing and sponsorship arrangement with Socios.com, which produces tokens for 53 football clubs across the world, including Crystal Palace, Leeds United, Manchester City, Everton and Aston Villa.  Fan tokens allow supporters to vote on certain matters decided by a club and to enter competitions. They must be bought, using Socios.com’s cryptocurrency Chiliz, and can be traded on cryptocurrency markets. Football Supporters Europe was highly critical of the three-year agreement. “We are appalled by Uefa’s decision to team up with Socios, a company that monetises fan engagement at the expense of match-going fans,” it said in a statement. “This is an incomprehensible move at a time when football needs protection from crypto-mercenaries.” FSE, who receive funding from Uefa, continued: “Uefa’s partnership with Socios legitimises risky investments in highly volatile and largely unregulated financial assets.” Another respected fan organisation, SD Europe, was also critical of the deal, which it said came in “stark contrast” to Uefa’s decision on Monday to give 30,000 free tickets to match-going fans for the finals of this year’s continental club competitions. “Meaningful fan engagement should be democratic, inclusive and transparent via formal mechanisms such as supporter involvement in governance structures, share ownership, voting rights and representative supporter groups,” SD Europe said. Uefa was approached by the Guardian for comment. In a press release its marketing director, Guy-Laurent Epstein, said: “We are always looking for innovative partnerships, including with the growing cryptocurrency and blockchain-based fan engagement market. With rich experience working with some of the top sports organisations around the world, it is clear that partnering with Socios.com is an ideal fit.” As part of the arrangement with Uefa, Socios.com will produce “add-on fan tokens” with Uefa branding which will be awarded to customers currently holding tokens in clubs. A Socios.com spokesperson said uses for the add-on tokens would be disclosed soon but that they would not be sold to customers nor available for trade. Socios.com was founded by the former poker entrepreneur Alexandre Dreyfus and has become the market leader in linking sport to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Dreyfus says that fan tokens enable clubs to better interact with the digital aspects of their fanbase. “The value that is provided is not financial and will never be financial,” he told Sky News last month, “The value is about the experience and the connection that is provided between the fan and the club.” The link between fan tokens and speculative trading has been part of the Socios.com offering since its launch in 2019. Some tokens have seen substantial falls in value, with the Arsenal token losing 60% since its launch in November last year. In December the Advertising Standards Authority called the club “irresponsible” and “misleading” for the way they had marketed their token, saying they had “failed to illustrate the risk of the investment”.",Sport/Football,Fan group ‘appalled’ by Uefa deal with cryptocurrency company ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/15/uefa-deal-with-cryptocurrency-company-socios-fan-group-appalled
2/16/2022,"Russian lawmakers have passed a direct appeal to Vladimir Putin to recognise the Russian-controlled separatist states of Donetsk and Luhansk, providing a way to up the ante in the regional crisis without launching an attack on Ukraine. Putin has said he will not immediately recognise the so-called republics but he is likely to wield that option as a bargaining chip as he continues to demand security guarantees from the west.  The stage-managed manoeuvre unfolded on Tuesday as Putin also confirmed a “partial” withdrawal of Russian forces from the Ukrainian border, a decision that would reduce the potential for a war if it involves a large number of troops. It is not yet clear that it will. Since 2014, Russia has used the deadly Donbas conflict to divert attention from its annexation of Crimea and as part of its strategy to maintain control over Ukraine’s geopolitical future. The Minsk ceasefire deal signed in 2015 formalised a plan to reinsert the Donbas territories into Ukraine but give them a veto over Kyiv’s foreign policy choices, including potential accession to Nato. But the deal has stalled over ceasefire violations, disagreements about what steps to take first, and a growing belief in Ukraine that the deal was signed at gunpoint and is no longer politically viable. Hawkish officials and prominent figures in Russia such as the head of RT, Margarita Simonyan, have called for recognition of the regions’ independence. But that is far from a popular sentiment and would remove a key element of the Kremlin’s leverage over Ukraine by killing the Minsk deal. “The recognition of the LPR and DPR [Luhansk and Donetsk people’s republics] by Russia would signify its intentional withdrawal from the Minsk agreements,” a Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesperson said on Tuesday. Moscow has already made it difficult to reintegrate the territories by issuing hundreds of thousands of Russian passports there and arming and backing their governments since 2014. Still, a formal recognition of independence would be seen as a considerable escalation. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said recognition would be a “blatant violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty”. And some European officials have said it would trigger sanctions packages put together to deter a Russian invasion. “The call of Russia’s State Duma to recognise the occupied territories of Ukraine is an open escalation,” said Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania’s foreign minister. “Approval by Kremlin should be met with swift and decisive sanctions.” The decision may give Putin a way to save face from the crisis, after trying and so far failing to achieve guarantees that Nato will not admit Ukraine and will remove its infrastructure from countries that joined after 1997. Rather than starting a war, he could kick out the legs from under the ceasefire settlement and move troops into Donbas or even provoke a Ukrainian attack, giving Russia a casus belli. While Putin argued in his remarks that his deputies were “following public opinion”, it is clear that the Duma vote on Tuesday was largely managed by the Kremlin. As Putin noted, the decision for a partial withdrawal from the borders was directly tied to the vote on recognising the republics. One form of pressure on Ukraine was being swapped for another. At an impasse in negotiations with the west, Putin is threatening to demolish the status quo. It may mean Russia is considering other options besides war to achieve its goals, but it also signals the Kremlin is growing impatient. “Russia hears that Ukraine is not prepared to join Nato today, and we know this premise,” Putin said after talks with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. “And they say right away that it won’t be admitted tomorrow, but will be admitted when they prepare it for this. But this might be too late for us. Therefore, we want this issue to be settled now, right now, in the near future, through a negotiating process, by peaceful means.”",News/World news,Duma manoeuvre points to Kremlin impatience in Ukraine standoff,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/15/duma-manouevre-points-to-kremlin-impatience-in-ukraine-standoff
2/16/2022,"The shameful racial inequalities documented by the NHS Race and Health Observatory report (Radical action needed to tackle racial health inequality in NHS, says damning report, 14 February) have rightly led to calls for action. But what has been missed is that even in the last decade alone, there have been a myriad of NHS-led plans, strategies and initiatives to tackle inequality. Some, such as the workforce race equality standard, had investment of millions of pounds. Yet the comparatively poorer experiences of black, Asian and minority ethnic patients and workers persist. In understanding why, we must look at where accountability has gone. Almost every equality plan or initiative has had some form of oversight group. Almost always, these are led and dominated by the NHS, with race equality organisations such as ours often in a minority of one. With critical voices often ignored and regulators, such as the Equality and Human Rights Commission or Care Quality Commission, rarely acting when failures to progress racial equality are found, we are left with NHS leaders able to jump from one initiative to the next without any real change.  Unless we have accountability that is not led by the usual suspects and have regulators that are willing to act, the actions that follow this damning report will go the same way as in the past.Jabeer ButtChief executive, Race Equality Foundation  Your article highlights that the pandemic has had a disproportionate effect on minority ethnic groups. This certainly echoes our experience as ethnic minority health and social care professionals. It is imperative that this matter is not just included in the terms of reference in the Covid-19 inquiry this spring, but forms a central part of Lady Hallett’s investigations. We make this call with a clear-eyed view of the pressures on the 73-year-old NHS and with hope for what an inquiry could do. Our members, who include clinicians, researchers and ancillary workers, are facing these challenges daily – from the lack of appropriate PPE during the pandemic to the heavy losses among our ranks and our loved ones. The inquiry must make space to hear our unique perspectives on how health inequality is experienced in terms of race and ethnic origin as a matter of national importance.Ade AdeyemiSecretary, Federation of Ethnic Minority Healthcare Organisations  The NHS Race and Health Observatory report is incredibly important and action needs to be taken now at all levels. C3 Collaborating for Health has been working for a decade to highlight the burden of ill health and premature mortality from the main chronic diseases (cancer, diabetes, heart disease, stroke) that occur disproportionately in minority populations – the same issues led to the high rates of death and serious illness from Covid-19. With the support of the Burdett Trust for Nursing, we will be working with nurses of black or Asian heritage who can engage with their local communities and improve health outcomes among minority ethnic patients. The “radical action” called for in the report needs to be addressed by better support for disadvantaged patients and for the key staff who can play a major part in the changes that are needed.Christine HancockFounder, C3 Collaborating for Health; former general secretary, Royal College of Nursing  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/16/2022,"Your editorial (8 February) criticising the draft police bill for further marginalising the already isolated Traveller community is both timeous and accurate. Rather than continued reliance within the bill on the sledgehammer approach of moving the problem of unauthorised encampments from one area to another – a proven costly failure – both central and local governments should look to replicate small successes from the past. In the 1980s and 90s, Strathclyde regional council, in partnership with central government, the 19 constituent district councils and representatives of the Traveller community, developed a network of serviced authorised sites for Traveller use across the region, the costs of which were shared by all councils, whether or not they actually hosted a site.  While such an innovative policy required sustained political commitment, and on occasion created controversy and friction, it was broadly successful in ensuring the availability of secure accommodation for a persecuted minority, while at the same time enhancing knowledge and understanding between the Traveller and settled communities.Phil MurrayLinlithgow, West Lothian  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

There will always be people who think that critics are serving their own interests by making things unnecessarily complicated.

Perhaps she has not come across the review by Julian Markels in Shakespeare Quarterly (1 April 1961), in which Markels dismisses Grebanier’s book as “garrulous and incoherent”, characterises its methodology as “irresponsible” and goes on to imply that Grebanier has, in any case, merely rewritten the work of an academic predecessor.Michael PykeShenstone, Staffordshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/16/2022,"Americans lost more than $1bn in 2021 alone to “romance scams” such as the one documented in the hit Netflix documentary The Tinder Swindler, according to the FBI.  The majority of the victims who were cheated out of their money were women older than 40, and women who are widowed, divorced, elderly or disabled, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) said in a press statement last week. Scammers often use poetry, flowers and other gifts to charm their victims, while keeping them concerned with stories of severe life circumstances, tragedies, death and injuries. “The criminals spend hours honing their skills, relying on well-rehearsed scripts that have been used repeatedly and successfully, and sometimes keep journals on their victims to better understand how to manipulate and exploit them,” the FBI said. “In some cases, victims may be recruited, unknowingly, to transfer illegally on behalf of others.” In 2020, there were approximately 24,000 complaints filed to IC3 that were categorized as romance scams, nearly 4,300 more than the previous year. The estimated losses in 2020 totaled approximately $605m – though the real figure is likely to be higher, given many victims feel too embarrassed, ashamed or humiliated to report being taken advantage of. Perhaps the most notable recent example of romance scams is the Tinder Swindler, the moniker given to the Israeli-born Simon Leviev, who pretended to be the son of a billionaire diamond dealer and defrauded unsuspecting women on dating apps of an estimated $10m. “Most often these scammers leave victims financially and emotionally devastated. Many victims may not have the ability to recover from the financial loss,” said Luis Quesada, special agent in charge of the FBI El Paso division. A study released last year by the cyber protection agency Malwarebytes revealed that people with less digital literacy are more prone to such scams. Those typically include ethnic minorities, women and older people, according to Malwarebytes. The FBI has offered tips on how to protect yourself online against potential abusers, including researching the person’s photo and profile to see if their images or details have been used elsewhere, being judicious about how much personal information you post – a “good scammer can turn a tiny bit of detail into a very effective punch”, the agency said – and never helping anyone move money, lest you become an unwitting money mule. “While we recognize that it may be embarrassing for victims to report this type of fraud, it’s important to do so, so that the FBI and our law enforcement partners can do everything in our power to ensure these online imposters are held accountable,” said Quesada.",News/US news,"Americans lost $1bn to Tinder-Swindler style romance cons last year, FBI says",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/15/tinder-swindler-americans-romance-scam-con-fbi
2/16/2022,"Fans of the original Star Wars trilogy, your time is up. Remember when you knew that the one true set of works based in a galaxy far, far away were the ones about Luke Skywalker? That the dreadful Attack of the Clones couldn’t be held up to The Empire Strikes Back? And that just thinking about Jar Jar Binks and Jake Lloyd’s acting was enough to make a million voices cry out in terror? Bad news: if you think like that, then when it comes to TV, Star Wars is no longer for you. Disney+ has confirmed that 25 May will be the launch date of its new Star Wars spin-off series: Obi-Wan Kenobi. After the announcement, Ewan McGregor – who reprises his role from the prequel trilogy of the late 90s and early 00s – explained who this show is being made for.  “People in their late teens or early 20s, those people who were kids who we made those films for, they loved them,” he told Forbes. “To them, they’re their Star Wars films, you know? For us, it was the original films of the 70s, but for them, it was our films were their Star Wars. So to step back into his shoes again now and do a series, a whole series about Obi-Wan Kenobi for those fans, it just makes me really happy.” That this is the show’s target audience probably shouldn’t come as a surprise, given that the Disney+ series directly follows on from Episode III – Revenge of the Sith, and takes place at a point where McGregor is yet to become Sir Alec Guinness. But the actor’s words confirm something that has seemed increasingly obvious to watchers of The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett: Star Wars really isn’t aimed at diehard fans of the original trilogy any more. It’s not just that Disney+’s Star Wars series are created with a younger generation in mind, they’re also clearly created for those who have followed post-prequel content like the animated shows, novels and comics. They’re full of nerd-pleasing references to what I’m going to call “New Star Wars”, which expands on events hinted at in the original trilogy and introduces a raft of new characters. Unless you’d followed the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars or Star Wars Rebels, to watch The Book of Boba Fett was to find yourself repeatedly asking things like: “When did that pointy black lightsaber become a thing? What does this Ahsoka person have to do with anything? And who the hell is Cad Bane, and why does he look like an alien Clint Eastwood?” Given its target audience and the period in which it’s set, the Obi-Wan series is likely to feature its fair share of references like this. Is absolutely everyone aware that Darth Maul was glued back together after being lopped in half and definitely killed in The Phantom Menace? If you were confused by his cameo in 2018’s Solo, prepare for further befuddlement. What’s ironic about Star Wars targeting younger audiences, though, is that about 87% of the franchise’s appeal comes from pure nostalgia. No matter how much additional material is introduced, fans new and old will always be drawn in by images of Darth Vader, the Millennium Falcon and Luke Skywalker doing a flip while wearing Yoda as a backpack. But it’s a more recent form of nostalgia Disney+ is increasingly targeting: nostalgia for the prequels and the immediate content that followed. Many will be delighted to see that Hayden Christensen is back as Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader for Obi-Wan Kenobi – even if his face is covered by a black helmet most of the time. They’ll also be eager to spend more time with McGregor’s Obi-Wan, who, in fairness, alongside Ian McDiarmid’s Chancellor Palpatine/Darth Sidious, was one of the best things about the prequels. Is it a good idea to keep revisiting old characters and filling in the blanks, though? The real concern here is that this show will commit the same crime as The Book of Boba Fett: ruin an iconic character’s mystique and legacy by exploring a story that really didn’t need to be told. Do we really need to see what Obi-Wan got up to on Tatooine while watching over a baby Luke Skywalker? Presumably there was a lot of hanging around while trying not to look creepy. There will surely also be a bit that explains why Obi-Wan has no recollection of R2-D2 when he meets him in the original trilogy, despite spending a significant chunk of his life with the bin-shaped droid. A fan of New Star Wars would argue that this kind of continuity correction is reason enough for the show to exist. Others would happily go without. Like The Mandalorian, there will undoubtedly be plenty to enjoy about Obi-Wan Kenobi. If the thought of it being aimed at prequel-loving fans who need to explore every corner of the galaxy fills you with abject horror, though, you should probably temper your expectations now.",Arts/Television & radio,New Star Wars: how the TV spin-offs became more The Phantom Menace than The Empire Strikes Back,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/15/new-star-wars-how-the-tv-spin-offs-became-more-the-phantom-menace-than-the-empire-strikes-back
2/16/2022,"Former Post Office workers who were among those wrongfully convicted for theft, fraud and false accounting have called for the company’s former management to go to jail for their part in the long-running scandal. More than 700 Post Office operators were prosecuted between 2000 and 2014, based on evidence from the Horizon IT system, which was installed and maintained by Fujitsu.  Damian Owen, who was manager of a Post Office branch in Bangor, north Wales, was jailed for eight months after he was accused of stealing £25,000 as a result of computer errors. His conviction was quashed in 2021. Owen was at times lost for words as he told the inquiry into the scandal about his time in prison. “I lost an awful lot of weight,” Owen told the inquiry. “I did what I could to pass the time as quickly as I could.” Owen said the £25,000 hole in his branch accounts appeared shortly after Horizon system was installed, and he knew the figures didn’t add up. “We never held that amount of money there. It was a small branch,” Owen said. “As far as I was aware, the most held there was £13,000.” Owen was giving evidence to the second day of the inquiry into the human impact of the failings of the company’s software. The inquiry is part of an investigation into one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in British legal history. Some of the convicted workers were sent to prison, others lost their livelihoods and their homes. Many went bankrupt, and some died before their names were cleared. The inquiry, which is being chaired by the retired high court judge Sir Wyn Williams, is expected to hear evidence from about 60 former Post Office workers over the coming weeks. Owen called for former Post Office management to face charges. “I want there to be convictions, not only for the people who have perpetuated the whole conspiracy inside the Post Office, everyone from the top down who knew and was still pushing charges,” he said. “I want charges against people not only in my court case who came to give evidence and lied under oath, I want each of them to receive a perjury charge.” Lorraine Margery Williams, a former sub-postmistress from Anglesey, also called for prosecutions of former Post Office managers. “I want them to go to jail for what they have done. But that would be an easy life for them. They’d come out and still have their money,” she said. “I want them to feel the way I felt and the way we suffered financially. I just want somebody to be accountable. It has gone on for so long and people are hiding. Somebody has got to be accountable for this.” Williams, who received a suspended prison sentence in 2012 before her conviction was quashed in 2021, said she had struggled to find work after her conviction, which also caused her family’s mortgage repayments to quadruple. Williams said the experience had profoundly affected her, her husband and her daughter. “I was a recluse, I wouldn’t go out. I still don’t feel I am the same person. I get angry at times,” she said. “I don’t trust anybody any more and it’s difficult.” Lisa Brennan, a former Post Office counter clerk from Huyton near Liverpool, ended up homeless after her conviction for theft in 2003. “I had no job and I couldn’t afford the mortgage. I had to sofa surf,” Brennan told the inquiry, adding she felt too ashamed to return to her home after being found guilty. Brennan insisted on her innocence throughout her trial and said she had planned to kill herself if she had been sent to prison, despite her daughter only being six years old at the time. She was given a suspended prison sentence, a conviction that was quashed last year. “It was the end of the world to me,” she said. “That was my life, all I had known was the Post Office from 16, and just to be told: ‘You’re a thief’ is horrible. I wasn’t, and hadn’t taken anything.” After her conviction, Brennan was declared bankrupt, her marriage ended and she attempted to take an overdose. “I used to drink a lot,” she said. “Vodka, wine, anything just to numb it.” Talking about her almost 20-year ordeal, Brennan said: “It is just scandalous. It should never have happened. I wasn’t the only one. All of us say the same thing, we were told: ‘It’s only you. Nobody else is making these mistakes.’” Janine Powell, originally from Tiverton in Devon, cried as she described how she was accused by the Post Office of stealing more than £71,000. When Powell was sent to prison in 2008, she was separated from her children, which she said had a big impact on their relationship. “We were all very close, and I think [my daughter] blamed me for leaving her,” she said. “It was hard to get that relationship back on track.” Powell had to wait for more than a decade until her conviction was quashed.

2/16/2022,"Over the past 11 years of men’s tennis, during which Novak Djokovic rose to dominance and improbably positioned himself as one of the greatest to play the game, the only time his success has been in doubt came after the summer of 2017 when he suffered through many months with an elbow injury. The injury became a point of contention between himself and his then-coach, Andre Agassi, who later said he had swiftly advocated for surgery. But Djokovic addressed the injury by resting for nearly six months, believing his body was built to heal itself naturally. It was not. After returning the next year to pain and early losses, Djokovic finally underwent surgery in February 2018. As he digested his guilt about agreeing to the surgery, he cried for days.  On Tuesday, Djokovic gave his first full interview since his deportation from Australia after arriving in the country without being vaccinated against Covid. Djokovic acknowledged that, as things stand in a worldwide sport that moves from country to country each week, his unvaccinated status means he is unable to play in the majority of tournaments. “That is the price I am willing to pay,” he said. In the same breath, Djokovic said with a smile that at such a critical moment in tennis history he understands his actions may deprive him of the possibility of winning the highest number of grand slam tournaments. He framed his decision in libertarian terms: “The principles of decision making on my body are more important than any title or anything else.” Djokovic’s conversation with the BBC was a reminder that his propensity for self-sabotage has become a defining trait. The principles that made him so averse to surgery in 2017 were not in tune with reality. After his surgery, he won the final two majors of that 2018 season and he has won eight since. The most controversial on-court moment of his career so far, his disqualification from the 2020 US Open after unintentionally hitting a line judge with a ball, came after near misses from which he failed to learn. Here he is again, his own worst enemy. As Djokovic attempts to navigate the world while unvaccinated – and while his biggest rival, Rafael Nadal, just took advantage of his absence to win a historic 21st grand slam title at the Australian Open – according to the ATP 99% of the top 100 is now vaccinated. He stands alone. Within the context of his career, Djokovic’s stubbornness has been an admirable quality. He emerged when Roger Federer and Nadal were competing to be the greatest of their generation yet he had the audacity to not only believe he could break the duopoly, while so many crumbled in their presence, but he did so in time. He has spent his career constantly recovering from impossible deficits, defying crowds roaring for his demise. Although an invaluable quality as an elite sportsman, outside the sporting bubble those qualities often just scan as selfish and hubristic. While the experience of twice being detained in Australia and then being deported might lead some to consider their decisions and look to make their life easier, it is hard not to think the experience has only further strengthened Djokovic’s beliefs. During his interview, Djokovic continually attempted to distance himself from the anti-vax movement. His actions speak louder than words. While he may not publicly spread Covid conspiracy theories, he was evidently prepared to risk spreading the virus when he decided to conduct an interview with a L’Équipe journalist in December two days after testing positive. “I was never against vaccination. I understand that globally, everyone is trying to put a big effort into handling this virus.” he said. He recognises the effect the pandemic has had on the world, yet he has opted out of the current push to address it. Djokovic further claimed he is keeping his “mind open” to vaccination in the future, yet he foreshadowed this entire scenario nearly two years ago in a widely circulated online discussion with his fellow Serbian players. Long before vaccines had come to light, he expressed his concern about the possibility of having to be vaccinated in order to travel. More than a year since the vaccine campaign began, there are numerous types of vaccines and answers to many questions Djokovic could be seeking. Rather than having an open mind, it seems like his thoughts have been set for some time. While he may not want to be seen as someone actively campaigning against vaccination, the result of his actions are evident. Djokovic has already ensured he will be celebrated by such people and the far right, and the manner in which the vultures descended during his time in Australia was telling, with his family even breaking bread with Nigel Farage at Djokovic’s restaurant as they followed one of the Serb’s court hearings. The reality for Djokovic now is no different from the two excellent weeks of tennis in Australia following his deportation. This sport stops for nobody and the other 99 players in the top 100 will continue to compete around the world. As long as Djokovic treads this path and vaccination restrictions remain, he will have to face the consequences of his decisions.",Sport/Sport,Novak Djokovic’s propensity for self-sabotage has become a defining trait | Tumaini Carayol,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/15/novak-djokovic-propensity-self-sabotage-defining-trait-tennis
2/16/2022,"The work of the American photographer Jesse Alexander, who has died aged 92, captured an era of international motor racing in which the personalities of the drivers and the sleek lines of the cars they drove were not yet obscured by the visual noise of sponsors’ insignia. At a time when competitors, photographers and journalists stayed in the same hotels, dined together and gave each other lifts to and from races across Europe, Alexander became a friend of many of the grand prix aces. Not just the Americans who crossed the Atlantic to try their luck during the postwar years, such as Masten Gregory, Dan Gurney, Richie Ginther and Phil Hill, the fellow Californian who in 1961 would become the US’s first world champion, but such European stars as Stirling Moss, Wolfgang von Trips and Jim Clark.  The action shots he provided for magazines such as Sports Illustrated and Car and Driver were outstanding, but the trust engendered by these personal friendships enabled him to take revealing photographs of the drivers in their less obviously heroic moments. A portrait of Clark at Spa in Belgium in 1962 showed not the elation of a young driver in the immediate aftermath of collecting the first world championship grand prix win of his career, but his exhaustion after a two-hour battle to fight his way up from 12th place on the starting grid to victory on a fast and notoriously dangerous track. Alexander’s backstage shots could include the more light-hearted image of an informal backgammon game on the steps of a hotel between two playboy drivers, the Franco-American Harry Schell and the Spanish aristocrat Alfonso de Portago. But they often reflected his interest in the less glamorous side of the sport, particularly among the men who wielded spanners and oily rags. “Perhaps the most important side of my work is the human side to it,” he once said. “A part of me somehow relates to the people who do the grunt work. In the 1950s the mechanics got their hands dirty and were as emotionally involved in the sport as the drivers.” To that end, between trips to Formula One races, Le Mans, the Mille Miglia and the Targa Florio, he visited workshops and test sessions where he could portray the hard work undertaken away from the crowds and the spotlight. But even a photograph of a car being unloaded from a transporter, a factory interior or a shirtsleeved Enzo Ferrari conferring with his chief designer would be composed and lit with an eye developed through his admiration of such photographers as Edward Steichen, W Eugene Smith, Jacques Henri Lartigue, Henri Cartier-Bresson and Robert Capa. Born into a wealthy family in Santa Barbara, California, Jesse was the son of Florence (nee Lyman) and Junius Alexander and grew up in Montecito, close to the ocean. After boarding schools in Massachusetts and Connecticut, he returned to study photography at the University of California in Santa Barbara. Already car-mad, he bought an MG TD in which he drove to watch races at Pebble Beach, Golden Gate Park and his local track, laid out on an airfield. In 1953 he travelled to Mexico to watch and photograph the Carrera Panamericana, a spectacular and highly dangerous four-day race over 1,900 miles of open roads, won by Juan Manuel Fangio in a Lancia. The following year Alexander took his wife and the first of their four daughters to Europe, where at the first race he attended, the French Grand Prix at Reims, the Mercedes-Benz team made their return to Formula One, with Fangio as the No 1 driver. A memorable photo taken during a break in practice for that race shows the 42-year-old Argentinian perched on a pit counter as three younger drivers – Eugenio Castellotti, Peter Collins and Olivier Gendebien – listen intently to what he has to say. In 1958 Alexander commissioned the architect Ernst E Anderegg, a student of Frank Lloyd Wright, to design a house for his family in Hohfluh, Switzerland, where his motor racing friends often came to stay. Once built, its appearance so scandalised the local authorities that they changed their building regulations. Covering thousands of miles in a Porsche coupe laden with the latest cameras, Alexander was a regular presence at the circuits until the early 70s, thereafter making occasional trips back to Europe for the 24 Hours of Le Mans or, latterly, the Goodwood Festival of Speed. Outside motor sport, he co-directed short films about Billingsgate fish market in London in the 60s and the construction of a modernist house in the hills above Santa Barbara. He took pictures of Bobby Kennedy on the campaign trail and, in his later years, birds being cared for at a raptor centre. His several books of motor racing photographs include At Speed (1972), Looking Back (1982) and Driven (2000), for which Moss provided an affectionate foreword. Alexander is survived by his second wife, Nancy, whom he married in 1965, their son, Jess, and his four daughters, Rori, Heidi, Andi and Susie, from his first marriage, to Patricia Beckham, which ended in divorce.

2/16/2022,"The knockout stage of Big Cup begins this evening, and thoughts naturally turn to Barcelona. They’re not in it, of course, but that’s exactly why everyone’s thinking about them. Barça shipped three goals on three occasions in the groups, and so now they’ve got a battle on to make the last 16 of Big Vase instead. Looking on the bright side, at least the likes of Bayern Munich, Roma and Liverpool can’t get at them from where they are now – though let’s hang fire on confidently declaring this new environment a humiliation-free safe space until we see what Napoli do to them in that Vase play-off game.  There is one player still in Big Cup who, if you cut him, would bleed blaugrana. Yes, it’s Lionel Messi, now plying his trade with all the other good-time charlies at PSG. Only the fiercely partisan, or those without a grasp of the fundamentals of broad-brush slapstick, would fail to find great humour in the GOAT suffering yet another 8-2 hiding on the biggest stage in club football. Nothing personal, you understand, but with the petroclubs having long gained the upper hand, we have to take our fun where we can get it, and if that means Messi once again watching in impotent despair from afar as ball after ball whistles into the net up the other end, each goal taking an oil-fuelled superclub further away from that elusive holy grail, then so be it. Take a hit for Team Humanity, Leo. But, truth be told, such delicious waves of bittersweet schadenfreude are unlikely to wash over us and cleanse the soul. For a start, PSG face Real Madrid in their Round of Arsenal tie, so any satisfaction derived by the pricking of petrohubris would be almost completely offset by the identity of their conquerors. It’s not exactly a romantic David-Goliath match-up, is it? Also, Real have only scored one goal in their last three games, their attack so blunt of late that Carlo Ancelotti has been forced to recall Golf’s Gareth Bale, so they’re unlikely to rout PSG tonight. Also also, there’s a fair chance Messi, Neymar and Kylian Mbappé will run up a cricket score themselves.

2/16/2022,"The stripping of Prince Andrew’s military roles and royal patronages marked a nadir for the Queen’s second son since sexual assault accusations arose amid concern over his relationship with the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. It was a fall from grace for the 61-year-old, who was once second in line to the throne.  Prince Andrew is born at Buckingham Palace, becoming the first child born to a reigning monarch since Princess Beatrice to Queen Victoria. Andrew joins the Royal Navy as a trainee helicopter pilot. He studies at Dartmouth naval college and completes Royal Marines courses. The prince serves in the Falklands war, after Argentinian forces invade the British overseas territory in the south Atlantic. He serves on HMS Invincible as a Sea King helicopter co-pilot. Andrew is promoted to lieutenant, and the Queen makes him her personal aide-de-camp. He serves onboard HMS Brazen as a flight pilot until 1986. Thousands line the streets in central London as Andrew marries Sarah Ferguson at Westminster Abbey, and on the same day the Queen makes him Duke of York, Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh. They go on to have two daughters – Princess Beatrice, born in August 1988, and Princess Eugenie, born in March 1990. The Duke and Duchess of York announce they are to separate. Divorce is finalised in May 1996, although the two remain close. Andrew is reportedly introduced to Epstein, an investment banker and financier, through a mutual friend, Ghislaine Maxwell – the daughter of the late media tycoon Robert Maxwell. A photograph that comes to light during Maxwell’s 2021 trial for sex trafficking shows her and Epstein at the Queen’s Balmoral residence that year. Epstein, Maxwell and Andrew are seen at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. Later that year, Epstein and Maxwell attend a joint birthday party at Windsor Castle hosted by the Queen, and the prince throws a shooting weekend for Maxwell’s birthday. According to Virginia Giuffre, Andrew sexually assaults her at Maxwell’s home in Belgravia, London, and also twice more, at Epstein’s New York home and at an “orgy” on his private island in the Caribbean when she was 17. The allegation prompts a comprehensive denial from the Duke of York. Andrew retires from the Royal Navy as commander. He is later promoted to rear admiral, in 2010, and vice admiral, in 2015. The government appoints him as special representative for international trade and investment. He represents the UK at trade fairs and conferences around the world. The prince visits Epstein in New York after Epstein’s release from prison for pleading guilty to prostituting minors. They are photographed walking through Central Park. The Duchess of York is filmed by a tabloid reporter claiming the prince would meet a donor and pass on business contacts if she receives £500,000. Andrew quits his trade envoy role after a furore about him visiting Epstein in New York after he had been jailed for sexual offences. Ferguson admits accepting money from Epstein to pay off debts. Allegations that Andrew had sex with Giuffre emerge in court documents in Florida related to Epstein. They say she was forced to have sex with him when she was 17, which is under the age of consent under Florida law. Buckingham Palace denies the allegations. Epstein is found dead in his jail cell after being re-arrested and charged with sex trafficking. Andrew steps back from public duties “for the foreseeable future” after a disastrous BBC TV interview where he claims he could not have had sex with Giuffre because he was at home after a visit to Pizza Express in Woking, that her description of his dancing with her beforehand could not be true because he was unable to sweat, and that he had “no recollection of ever meeting this lady”. A New York judge rejects the prince’s attempts to throw out a sexual abuse civil lawsuit brought against him by Giuffre. The Queen strips her son of a range of military affiliations and royal patronages after more than 150 veterans write to describe their “upset and anger”. Giuffre’s lawyer insists she would be unlikely to accept a “purely financial settlement” to end her sexual assault civil lawsuit against the royal. The lawyer says that although she does not have a firm idea of what she wants, it is important that any resolution happens “in a way that vindicates her and vindicates the other victims”. Giuffre requests testimony from Andrew’s former assistant Robert Olney on the grounds that she has “reason to believe” he has “relevant information about Prince Andrew’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein”. Andrew’s lawyers ask to question Giuffre’s husband and psychologist on the grounds that she may have “false memories”. Shukri Walker, who may have seen Andrew with Giuffre at a London nightclub 20 years ago, says she is willing to provide testimony in Giuffre’s civil lawsuit. Her lawyer said “she remembers the night clearly because she never saw a royal before or since”. In legal filings submitted to the New York court, Andrew denies he was a co-conspirator of Epstein and that the disgraced financier trafficked girls to him, and insists on a jury trial. His lawyers reiterate their previously unsuccessful claim that Giuffre’s 2009 settlement with Epstein shields Andrew from litigation. A date in March is set for Andrew to give evidence under oath. In a remarkable turnaround, Andrew reaches a settlement in principle with Giuffre in which he agrees to make a “substantial donation” to a charity, and accepts that Giuffre “suffered as an established victim of abuse”. In a document submitted to the New York court, Andrew says he regrets his association with Epstein.",News/UK news,The fall of Prince Andrew – a timeline,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/13/prince-andrew-a-timeline
2/16/2022,"A Black Lives Matter group in south Wales has closed down after revelations that a covert police unit attempted to recruit one of its members to be an informant. The Swansea BLM group said it had decided to dissolve itself for a number of reasons, including the attempted recruitment by the police and threats to its members’ physical and mental safety from far-right activists.  Lowri Davies, one of the group’s main organisers, exposed a covert police operation to persuade her to become an informant last year by secretly recording the approach. It was the first public evidence that the police have sought to enlist a mole within the Black Lives Matter movement in the UK. On Tuesday, Davies said the attempt by South Wales police to recruit her had had “a massive impact” on the group, leading to members drifting away. She said supporters were too scared to join, adding: “It felt like we were fighting against the odds.” In a statement, BLM Swansea said: “While we have found that our organisation has done some important work, we have been subject to an attempt of infiltration at the hands of South Wales police” and harassment by far-right activists who have visited the homes of supporters and published its members’ personal information online. The group added: “Swansea has proven to be a tricky place to mobilise, and we have found it difficult to find volunteers and a considerable amount of our members left (understandably so) when South Wales police attempted their infiltration.” “We’ve had a great year and a half of organising but it’s time to dissolve our organisation, a decision which has been further cemented by the lack of community within organising spaces.” The group, which had about seven core members and hundreds of supporters online, was set up after the murder of George Floyd in the US by a white police officer in 2020. The group supported local campaigns against alleged police brutality and racism. Last March, Davies, a Swansea University law student, secretly recorded calls from one of the covert police officers seeking to persuade her to become an informant. She shared the recording with the Guardian to raise awareness of what she says were “distressing” techniques used to try to manipulate her into supplying information to the police. South Wales police said they neither confirmed nor denied any specific details, adding: “A complaint was received which refers to contact made by a covert officer. This is currently being investigated and therefore it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.” The Network for Police Monitoring, a civil liberties group, said: “Police attempts to recruit informers in activist groups is about disruption as much as gathering intelligence and it takes its toll on campaigners’ morale.”",News/UK news,British BLM group closes down after police infiltration attempt,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/15/swansea-black-lives-matter-british-blm-group-closes-down-after-police-infiltration-attempt
2/16/2022,"Republicans in states across America are targeting LGBTQ rights through a wave of “educational gag orders”, a free speech group has warned, as conservatives battle to censor discussion of race and sexual identities in schools. More than 100 bills censoring teachers have been introduced in state legislatures this year, according to a report by PEN America – a non-profit which works to protect freedom of expression in the US – in what the organization says is a “national assault on our education system”.  The warning comes as conservatives have launched efforts to ban books pertaining to race and LGBTQ+ issues from classrooms in various states, while some legislatures are pushing to introduce laws which would ban teachers from discussing homosexuality. “From book bans to educational gag orders, schools and universities are being threatened today to a degree that has no recent parallel,” PEN America said. “There is a willingness, and even eagerness, to bring the weight and power of government to bear on controlling classroom speech.” In the last year, PEN America counted 155 bills introduced in 38 states that would censor what teachers can say or teach in classrooms. In 2022 there has been a “steep rise” in the introduction of what PEN America calls “gag orders”, the organization said. Florida’s ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill, which would ban discussion of sexuality and gender identity in schools, has already been widely criticized, with Pete Buttigieg, the US transportation secretary, among those who have condemned the bill as dangerous. The legislation was passed by the statesenate’s education committee on February 8, and has been endorsed by Ron DeSantis, Florida’s governor. The bill, which must pass the full Florida senate and the house before becoming law, would allow parents to file lawsuits against school boards if they believe policies violate the law. A bill introduced in the Kansas house on February 9 would change the state’s obscenity law, PEN America reported, making it a class B misdemeanor for a teacher to use any material which depicts “homosexuality” in a classroom. In Arizona, Republicans have introduced a bill which would require parental consent for a student to join a school club “involving sexuality, gender or gender identity”. “As a result,” PEN America said, “gay and bisexual students seeking support from their classmates would essentially have to out themselves to their parents first.” PEN America said the wave of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation was linked to the anti-critical race theory (CRT) movement, which has seen some states ban discussion of the modern-day impact of historic racism in the US. CRT is an academic discipline that examines the ways in which racism operates in US laws and society. “[The anti-critical race theory movement] has primed the public to support sweeping censorship of classroom speech. For anti LGBTQ+ activists, this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, a chance to ram through bills that are far more restrictive than anything the public would normally accept. The goal is quite simply to lock LGBTQ+ topics on the wrong side of the schoolhouse gate,” the report from PEN America said.",News/World news,Bills to ban US schools’ discussion of LGBTQ+ issues are threat to free speech – report,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/15/lgbtq-rights-ban-us-schools-republicans
2/16/2022,"The iconic tenor of my lifetime – and in terms of sheer voice, the very best – was Luciano Pavarotti. I only heard him once in the flesh, in a production of Verdi’s La Forza del Destino at London’s Royal Opera House. His interest in the stage action was limited, but his vocal resources were only marginally depleted after decades of shining high Cs, and I felt the magic. What had propelled Pavarotti into the stratosphere of international celebrity was a celebratory event at the 1990 World Cup in the Baths of Caracalla in Rome: the famous Three Tenors concert in which he sang Puccini’s aria from Turandot, Nessun Dorma, with its climactic high B on the word “vincero” – “I will win”.  I was then a young singer making my way in the apparently more rarefied worlds of Lieder and Mozart opera, and I was more than a little snobbish about all this; a snobbishness that no doubt sprang from defensiveness about my vocal capacities, as well as protectiveness for the leaner repertoire that I performed and loved. Sir Colin Davis very adventurously once asked me to sing the Verdi Requiem, the nearest I ever got to the Italian big guns, but I knew it was not for me. But the Ron Howard documentary on Pavarotti set me thinking about what we really value in great singing. The triumphalism, the sheer athleticism of the classic tenor voice is all very well, but watching Pavarotti singing Puccini’s E lucevan le stelle from Tosca, late in his career, conducted by his friend and fellow tenor Plácido Domingo, I realised that he was not just a voice, not just a tenor, but an expressive artist of extraordinary gifts. The desperation of the aria draws from Pavarotti that miraculous interaction between the personal life experience and artistic material that is at the heart of what great singers do. Great singers such as Pavarotti, or Billie Holiday, or Bob Dylan. My latest recording is a collection of 17th-century Venetian and Neapolitan opera arias, written in an era in which the tenor was not the shining star he became in the course of the 19th and 20th centuries. Indeed, the beginnings of the tenor were lowly. The term itself comes from the Latin verb “tenere” – “to hold” – and emerged from medieval vocal ensemble music in which the higher male voice provided an underpinning in terms of pitch and long vowels. Nothing glamorous there. But by the early 17th century, the tenor had emerged as a crucial figure in the development of the new form of opera. The earliest opera that we still perform as part of the repertoire is Monteverdi’s Orfeo, written in 1607 for the Gonzaga court at Mantua, with the dominating title role played by a tenor. As Giovanni Battista Dona had it in 1635, “the tenor has a better adjusted and more perfectly organised body,” something with which we can all agree. The story that is usually told is that the glamour of the castrato singer – a male mezzo soprano or soprano with prodigious power and virtuosity – came in the course of the 17th century, to force the tenor into the shadows. While there is an element of truth in this, it remained the case that significant roles were written for particularly charismatic singers with tenor voices, well into the 18th century – not least the Handelian triumvirate of Francesco Borosini, Annibale Pio Fabri and John Beard. It’s also the case that arias written for high voices, castrato and female, were often reassigned to lower male voices in so-called octave transposition. Handel did this, as did many of his contemporaries, adjusting their music to the voices on hand. My recording includes both of these sorts of arias, and what has interested me most in them has been the opportunity they offer for a sort of singing that is far removed from the clarion high-wire ascendancy of the post-Romantic tenor and the roles for which Pavarotti and Domingo were most famous. The orchestras these arias were written for were smaller, as were most of the theatres they were sung in. The instruments were less loud. The vocal writing can be florid but it never focuses on sheer virtuosity, either in terms of fast passage work or cultivated high notes. There is an opportunity here to cultivate the ideal set out by one of the earliest opera composers, the tenor Jacopo Peri, of whom it was said that “his singing would have moved to tears any heart of stone”. The emphasis is on the natural voice, not over-projected, moving within a moderate extension of its speaking range and using vowel sounds and consonants to create colours in much the same way as the great jazz singers – Billie Holiday for example. I’ve spent quite a lot of time in the past couple of years working with the jazz pianist and composer Brad Mehldau. He wrote us a song cycle, The Folly of Desire, with texts by Blake, Brecht, Yeats and Cummings among others, and with a stylistic compass from the delicately classical to a raucous impersonation of Supertramp (“with Wurlitzer”, as the directions at the head of the song read). In recital we would then perform Schumann’s Dichterliebe and a set of jazz standards, on one occasion in Prague segueing seamlessly from Schubert’s Nacht und Träume into Cole Porter’s Night and Day. Returning to the baroque after this excursion, I remembered the great William Christie, creator of the French baroque group Les Arts Florissants, telling me 25 years ago – much to my bafflement – how much jazz there was in this music. And I note now that my favourite contemporary jazz vocalist is Cécile McLorin Salvant, trained in the French baroque. Maybe the artificial barriers are breaking down? And maybe classical singers are not first and foremost tenors, sopranos, baritones or what not, but just singers plain and simple.

2/16/2022,"The Future Fund has been forced to divest about $5m in taxpayers’ money from a Chinese state-controlled weapons manufacturer sanctioned for selling arms to the genocidal Myanmar military. Last year, the Guardian revealed that Australia’s sovereign wealth fund had invested $4.9m in five subsidiaries of the Chinese arms conglomerate Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC).  AVIC had sold the Myanmar military K-8 light combat aircraft, 16 JF-17M combat aircraft, 40 short-range PL-5E missiles and 24 longer-range PL-12 missiles. The Future Fund divested from AVIC in November, a month after the investment was revealed in freedom of information documents. The government is trying to shield the Future Fund from future FOI requests about its investments. At Senate estimates on Tuesday, Greens senator Nick McKim asked Future Fund chief executive, Dr Raphael Arndt, whether the divestment was only made due to the embarrassment of the FOI. Arndt said the divestment was made due to US sanctions against AVIC. “In August 2021, the US treasury announced that there would be investment sanctions against one AVIC subsidiary, being Avic Shenyang Aviation Company Ltd, which is one of the companies we had an investment in,” Arndt said. “[We] proceeded to divest that position. Under the sanction that was issued, they had until June of this year to do that and I believe the response to the FOI request was October 2021. In November of 2021, that position was fully divested.” UN investigators say Myanmar’s military, known as the Tatmadaw, executed 2017 “clearance operations” with “genocidal intent” against the ethnic minority Rohingya in Rakhine state. Evidence suggests the military was involved in mass killings, including of children, as well as gang rapes, arson and torture. The UN also found in 2019 that China was breaching international humanitarian law by transferring military supplies through AVIC to the Tatmadaw. Arndt said the $4.9m investment in AVIC was made through an index fund, and that the Future Fund doesn’t look at individual companies it invests in through index positions. That is left to third-party investment managers, he said. But McKim said it was clear the divestment would not have happened without the FOI request. “The Future Fund had been caught out investing Australians’ money in companies facilitating the coup in Myanmar, massacres of civilians and the brutal repression of democracy,” he said. “Coupled with the Future Fund’s previous investments in the Adani Group, this clearly highlights why we shouldn’t allow the secrecy of making their investments exempt from freedom of information laws, as the government is proposing.” In anticipation of the Future Fund’s appearance at estimates, an alliance of aid, human rights groups and unions wrote to the chair of the fund, Peter Costello, to express their alarm at the revelations. The groups included Amnesty International, Justice for Myanmar, the Australian Council for International Development, the Australian Centre for International Justice, and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. “Any Future Fund investments in companies supplying arms to, or in partnership with, the Myanmar military are fuelling the very human rights abuses that are causing the dire humanitarian situation in Myanmar necessitating the provision of humanitarian and development aid to mitigate the impacts of those abuses,” the group said. “It undermines the Australian government’s support for a return to peace and democracy in Myanmar, its own humanitarian and development support and its support for Asean’s five-point consensus and an end to the violence unleashed by the military.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The government is seeking to shield the Future Fund from future FOIs about its investments.

2/16/2022,"The Coalition used its $187m safer communities grants program to fund at least 10 projects that had been deemed “unsuitable” by the department after the project applicants were visited in person by Peter Dutton’s assistant minister, Jason Wood. An auditor general’s report into the program released on Monday also revealed that decisions to award grants against the recommendations of the department had been influenced by the lobbying of MPs and senators. It raised concerns about applicants having direct access to decision-makers.  The audit, which found the program favoured Coalition-held seats in the lead-up to the last election, is critical of how grants were awarded with more than half delivered without a “clear basis for the decision”. Over five rounds of the program – which fell under the responsibility of Dutton as then home affairs minister – 225 applications were awarded funding worth $47.9m against the recommendations of the department. Of these, 23 projects worth a combined $7m were “assessed as either ineligible or unsuitable”. According to the audit, nine “unsuitable” applications were approved for a combined $3m of grant funding in round four of the program, which was opened just before the 2019 election, with five of these decisions being “informed by a visit by the minister during the assessment process”. “However, the records did not explain how the information obtained during the visit had impacted upon how well each application was considered to have performed against the published merit criteria,” the audit stated. The ministerial visits by Wood, the assistant home affairs minister, happened after applications for the round had already closed ahead of the 2019 election. Another five of these “unsuitable” projects were awarded funding after representations were made from MPs and senators, despite the records not explaining “how the representation had impacted upon how well each application was considered to have performed against the published merit criteria”. All of the projects funded after Wood’s visits were assessed as unsuitable against the published merit criteria, scoring between 33 and 53 out of 100, and “each failing the published threshold of scoring at least 50 per cent against one or more of the individual criteria”. In another round, seven projects were successful on the basis of a ministerial visit, with five previously assessed as “unsuitable” and another deemed ineligible. The unsuitable ranking meant that the merit scores received by the projects “were not high enough for it to either be recommended for funding or included on the list of candidates for the reserve list”. One of those projects was approved on the basis of both a ministerial visit and a letter from the local MP in support of it. Commenting on the manner in which grants were awarded, the audit highlights the “importance of transparent and equitable access to grant funding opportunities”. It compares the process used in the program to the problem that would arise if tenderers were able to “engage directly with the decision-maker” for government procurement. “Applicants for grant funding invest time, effort, and resources in preparing and submitting their applications,” the audit states. “The CGRGs (Commonwealth Grants Rules and Guidelines) do not specifically address the transparency and equity issues that arise when applicants seek to engage with decision-makers prior to decisions being taken on which candidates will receive grant funding. “As the risks that arise in these circumstances are similar to those that would arise in a procurement if some tenderers were able to engage directly with the decision-maker, there would be benefits in the CGRGs explicitly addressing whether applicants should be able to interact with decision-makers prior to grant funding decisions being taken. “And if so, how risks to the principles of equity, transparency and probity are to be managed.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The projects funded on the back of ministerial visits by Wood were in addition to two projects awarded grants by Dutton during the Braddon byelection in 2016, which were announced prior to an application being made and against the recommendations of the department. The audit raises concern about the impact of ministerial visits on the decision-making process, saying that how they influenced grant decisions was not made clear. “The records of decisions did not set out how information collected during ministerial visits to certain applicants and representations from parliamentarians was being relied upon to inform an assessment against the grant opportunity guidelines.” The auditor general points to the obligations under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act regarding the approval of expenditure by ministers, saying that they are required to “undertake reasonable inquiries to satisfy themselves that the proposed expenditure would be an efficient, effective, economical and ethical use of public resources”. Ministers are required “to record the terms of the approval” under the act, and are also obliged under the commonwealth grants rules to “record in writing the basis for the approval relative to the grant opportunity guidelines and the key principle of achieving value with relevant money”. In parliament on Tuesday, Labor asked the now home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, to explain why the Holland Park Mosque, which had applied for a grant “after being subject to a number of Islamophobic attacks” had missed out on funding. The mosque was vandalised with swastikas and references to the Christchurch shooter as a “saint”. In response, Andrews said that the government “had always acted in the best interests of our communities” but acknowledged there had been some ministerial “intervention”. “There were a range of programs that were assessed by the department and, yes, there was some intervention from ministers responsible to support key programs in a number of seats. “So those opposite can get all precious and work themselves up about how grant funding was in fact allocated, but there were instances where ministers did take specific responsibility to make sure that programs could be supported in various communities.” Wood was contacted for comment.",News/Australia news,"‘Unsuitable’ projects approved for community safety grants after ministerial visits, auditor general says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/16/unsuitable-projects-approved-for-community-safety-grants-after-ministerial-visits-auditor-general-says
2/16/2022,"As a teenager, Dean Nicolle dreamed of planting one of every eucalypt species in Australia. He took his parents to nurseries and requested that they buy “any eucalypt with a different name on it”. Nicolle, a self-described “gum nut” who is now a botanist and ecologist, has been fascinated by plants since he was eight. On a plot of land at Currency Creek, an hour’s drive south of Adelaide, he set about creating his own arboretum. “The first plantings went in in 1992,” he recalls.  Today, Nicolle’s arboretum is comprehensive: it has more than 10,000 plants of more than 900 different species and subspecies of eucalypt. Eucalypts are golden, literally: trees in South Australia and Western Australia have been found to draw up water containing gold and deposit the metal on their leaves and branches. They are blue, too: forests of the iconic plants release compounds called terpenoids into the air, scattering light to give the Blue Mountains its characteristic haze. And eucalypt flowers can be almost every colour conceivable: there’s the purple of the Port Lincoln mallee, the pale pink of the caesia – also known as the silver princess – and the fluorescent yellow of the book-leaf mallee. “Eucalypts have fed obsessions, trailed questions, and leaned against each other in a pyre of ideas and images,” writes Ashley Hay in Gum: The story of eucalypts & their champions, a new edition of which was published in November. “They have been grown, pulped, painted, written – and ignored.” Each year, 25 species are chosen by Eucalypt Australia, a charitable trust, for a public Eucalypt of the Year poll. “It’s primarily an awareness and education tool,” says Linda Baird, chief executive of the organisation. Nicolle, who consulted on the poll, says narrowing down the list for voting was a tough ask. “That’s really difficult when you’re talking over 900 different species of eucalypts.” Voting in the 2022 competition opened this week. So which eucalypts have made the shortlist? Though the terms eucalypt, Eucalyptus and gum tree are often used interchangeably, they aren’t synonymous. Eucalyptus is a genus – a scientific category – of eucalypt. In Australia, plants belonging to the Eucalyptus, Angophora and Corymbia genera are known as gum trees – so called for the sticky substance, called kino, that many of the plants produce. Whether in John Williamson’s twangy cover of Home Among the Gum Trees, or the ghost gums that feature prominently in the landscapes of Albert Namatjira, images of giant eucalypts loom large in the Australian consciousness. As well as the ghost gum – which is also called ilwempe by the Arrernte people – other towering species in contention for Eucalypt of the Year include the mountain ash, which grows up to 100 metres high and is one of the tallest flowering plants in the world. There’s also the much-loved Sydney red gum, the lemon-scented gum and the messmate stringybark, a resilient species that gave rise to the term Eucalyptus. But many eucalypts aren’t trees at all. More than 300 species are shrubs, and some are even pot-plant sized. “Eucalypts grow everywhere from your ankles to 100 metres high,” Baird says. Of the smaller species featured in the voting list is the Mongarlowe mallee, the rarest eucalypt in Australia. There are only six individuals of the critically endangered species left – and they could be as old as 10,000 years. Also known as the ice age gum, the Mongarlowe mallee is thought to be a relic of when conditions in Australia were wetter and cooler, Nicolle says. Previous winners – river red gum, snow gum, red-capped gum/illyarrie and gimlet gum – are ineligible to win this year. “Climate change would be by far the biggest threat to eucalypt species in general,” Nicolle says. “Even though they occur over most of Australia and a lot of different climatic conditions – from the mountains down to the sea – most eucalypt species are quite restricted in distribution. “They’re only adapted to a very narrow climatic range, whether it be rainfall, soil type, temperature, or a combination of all those things.” One example featured on the voting list is the endangered Morrisby’s gum. There are only a few thousand individuals found on two small hills near Hobart. “Because the climate’s been drying there, particularly the winter rainfall over the last decade, the trees have been put under a lot more water stress,” Nicolle says. “Then you get other problems … they’re more susceptible to insect attack and also predation from possums.” As a result, mature trees start to die, without regeneration of new trees. “[Eucalyptus] morrisbyi is just one example of that,” Nicolle says. “But that’s happening all over Australia, and particularly southern Australia, where winter rainfall is dropping off.” The increasing frequency of bushfires is also an existential threat. Drive through some regions that have burnt in recent years, and you might see charred trees fluffy with new green growth. This occurs because some eucalypt species have epicormic buds that lie dormant beneath the bark. “There’s a regulatory hormone in the crown [the top part of the tree], which stops the epicormic buds shooting normally,” Baird says. Damage such as by fire results in extensive sprouting and revegetation. “Then other places you go to, the trees are dead,” Baird says. “They just don’t have this ability.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Nicolle says: “There’s about 80 species that are killed by fire, so they only regenerate by seed.” This includes the mountain ash and the coral gum. For some species, regeneration to maturity takes decades. “If you’re getting fires more often than the trees can seed, grow up again and flower and seed again, then they become locally extinct in an area,” he says. Though eucalypts are evocative of the Australian bush, many species thrive in urban environments. “People forget that there are a lot of smaller-growing species that are quite suitable for home gardens and for planning in parks,” Nicolle says. He would like to see smaller eucalypts such as the octopus mallee, the coral gum and the Moon Lagoon mallee planted more in cities, over popular exotic trees such as Manchurian pears, plane trees and flowering cherries. “While all of those [trees] are good trees, none of them have the biodiversity benefits that some of these eucalypts have in attracting native wildlife.” Eucalypt of the Year voting is open until 30 March.",News/Environment,Eucalypt of the Year: 25 species from tall to small vie for top tree,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/16/eucalypt-of-the-year-25-species-from-tall-to-small-vie-for-top-tree
2/16/2022,"Government funding for private schools has increased at nearly five times the rate of public school funding over the past 10 years according to new analysis, with predictions of a $74bn shortfall in money for public schools this decade despite the shift to a needs-based scheme. The analysis compared combined commonwealth and state government funding for schools in 2009-10 to 2019-20, based on the Productivity Commission’s report on government services, released earlier this month. It was conducted by the public school advocacy group Save our Schools.  In that decade, funding for private schools – including Catholic and independent institutions – increased by $3,338 per student, adjusted for inflation, compared to $703 per student for public schools. Trevor Cobbold, an economist and national convenor for Save Our Schools, disputed claims by state and commonwealth governments that all schools had enjoyed increased funding. “In nominal terms, that is true, but when you take account of inflation, the funding hasn’t kept up with costs, so that means they’ve been cutting the real resources in public schools – and this has been happening for a decade right across the states,” he said. While commonwealth funding of state school students increased by $1,181 over the decade, state spending dropped in that time by $478 per student, the analysis found. “At a state level it’s also been disastrous for public schools, because state governments are the primary funders of public schools and on average, across Australia, they have cut funding,” Cobbold said. In 2017 the Turnbull government passed needs-based education funding legislation based on the Schooling Resource Standard (SRS). The benchmark is an estimate of how much total public funding a school requires to meet its students’ educational needs, and is based on recommendations from the 2011 Gonski review. Under the reform, overfunded independent schools would have their funding brought down to the SRS benchmark by 2029 while underfunded public schools would have their funding increased. However, Cobbold said there was an average shortfall in public school funding of $6.7bn per year between now and 2029, a total of $74bn since the 2019-2020 financial year. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Meanwhile, he said, successive Coalition federal governments had increased funding to private schools such as through the $1.2bn “choice and affordability fund” – designed to soften the financial impact for non-government schools during the transition to a new funding model. “The projections are that until the end of the decade, private schools will be overfunded – [that is,] funded over 100% of their Schooling Resource Standard – and public schools won’t even be funded to 91%,” he said. The Australian Education Union’s pre-budget submission has called for an “urgent” and “bold” investment in public school funding, including calling for the commonwealth to fund schools to a minimum of 100% of the SRS. Margery Evans, chief executive of Independent Schools Australia, stressed that the “vast majority” of enrolment growth in the independent school sector in the past five years was in low to medium fee schools. “These are the schools that receive higher levels of government funding overall due to their communities’ lower capacity to contribute,” she said. Under the current school funding agreement struck in 2019, the commonwealth contributes 80% of the SRS for private schools, while state governments are responsible for the remaining 20%. The split is reversed for public schools. But Cobbold said the states’ “formal target” for public schools was only 75%, contributing to the under-funding. Additionally, he said the current funding agreement also allowed states to include in its SRS contributions spending on items not originally deemed part of the Gonski benchmark such as depreciation, transport and payroll tax. New South Wales’ education minister, Sarah Mitchell, said because the figures in the Save Our Schools analysis were not taken directly from the Productivity Commission Report they were “unable to be validated by the Department of Education”. Mitchell said growth in the state’s expenditure for each student from 2010-11 to 2019-20 had exceeded all other states and territories and was more than double the national average. Victoria’s education minister, James Merlino, said since 2014-15 the state had increased its recurrent spending for government school students by more than 30%. “I have repeatedly asked the Commonwealth to do its fair share and fund the final 5% of the schooling resource standard for government schools – and it has consistently refused to do so,” he said. Overall, in 2019-20 the commonwealth spent $3,246 on public school students and the states spent $11,935, for a total of $15,181. Meanwhile, the commonwealth spent $10,211 for each private school student and the states spent $2,978, a total of $13,189. The figures exclude user cost of capital, depreciation, payroll tax and school transport as these items are not included in the funding figures for private schools. Cobbold said the upcoming federal election provided an opportunity to recast education funding as a key policy area, or else inequalities in funding would worsen over the rest of the decade. A spokesperson for the acting education minister, Stuart Robert, said the government services report showed the commonwealth’s investment had grown faster for both government and non-government schools compared to states and territories. “The Morrison government is proud of providing record school funding to all schools to meet the educational needs of Australian students now and into the future, with $315.2bn to be provided to schools between 2018 and 2029 under the government’s Quality Schools package.” The federal opposition’s education spokesperson, Tanya Plibersek, said a Labor government would work with states and territories to ensure every public school was “on a path to its full and fair level of funding”.",News/Australia news,"Private school funding has increased at five times rate of public schools, analysis shows",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/16/private-school-funding-has-increased-at-five-times-rate-of-public-schools-analysis-shows
2/16/2022,"Dave Hughes has been one of Australia’s best-loved comedians for more than two decades. In that time, Hughesy thinks he must have toured “up to 20” different shows. “People always say to me, are you worried about running out of material? And I say no, because life will always be ridiculous,” he wheezes. “And it appears to be getting more ridiculous by the day. So there’s always things to laugh about.”  His latest show, which is coming to both the Adelaide Fringe festival and Melbourne comedy festival this year, is called Trending. It’s about getting blasted on Twitter for various pandemic-related opinions – like suggesting everyone should get vaccinated. The inspiration is “being slandered left, right and centre and how to deal with it,” he says. “You’ve either gotta laugh or cry, and I’ve learned to laugh at people saying nasty things about me.” But Hughesy wasn’t always a conversation-starter. He still has diaries from the days when he was unemployed, living in Perth and only just toying with the idea of getting into comedy. Here, he tells us why he’d save that stack of old exercise books in a fire, as well as the story of two other important personal belongings. I would save the diaries that I kept when I was 22 years old. I was living in Perth, I had just given up alcohol, and I was thinking about trying to become a comedian. People who read them say I should turn them into a book, which I’ve never done. But it’s all sitting there: the ambitions of a young bloke who had quit uni, was on the dole, without a girlfriend or any money. Just dreams.

2/16/2022,"Floodwaters carrying “blackwater” lethal to aquatic life are moving south in the Barwon-Darling river towards the Menindee Lakes, raising fears the situation may cause a repeat of events in 2019 where over a million native fish were killed. Blackwater events are caused when heavy rains wash leaf litter that has collected on a floodplain into a major river such as the Barwon-Darling, turning it the colour of dark tea.  Australian National University (ANU) ecologist Dr Matt Colloff said they were dangerous to aquatic life as the organic compounds plants used for protection against insect attack leached out of leaf litter and dissolved into the river. “Bacteria then break down the dissolved organic compounds and release carbon dioxide,” Colloff said. “In the process of metabolising carbon, the bacteria use up the oxygen in the water.” Colloff said once concentrations of dissolved oxygen fell below about 2-3mg/L, fish suffocated because they could not draw enough oxygen from the water through their gills to survive. As blackwater events move slowly and can stretch for kilometres, there is no way for fish and other aquatic life to swim through it. Depending on the geography of the area, they can be left with nowhere to hide as the waters approach, resulting in a mass die off. The Menindee Lakes were hit by a mass die off in 2019 that is thought to have killed more than a million native fish, devastating stocks of bony herring, Murray cod, silver perch and golden perch. A spokesperson for NSWWater said in a statement the blackwater had started arriving in the upper Menindee lakes at Lake Weatherell, where the Barwon-Darling enters the system. There had been “no scope for intervention” upstream of the artificial lake system “all the way to the Queensland border”, the statement said, but efforts were under way to “shandy” the blackwater by releasing fresh water into it. “WaterNSW is releasing some of this low-quality blackwater from Lake Wetherell into the adjoining Lake Pamamaroo, where it is being diluted by better-quality water in Pamamaroo, as well as offering native fish some refuge from the worst of the blackwater. “Exposing this water to the large surface area of Lake Pamamaroo is also intended to improve dissolved oxygen levels.” The spokesperson said the blackwater entering the system had also been aerated as it moved through the gates at Lake Weatherill and Lake Menindee, but stressed the combined efforts were not a “silver bullet”. Menindee resident Graeme McCrabb said he noticed the blackwater arrive on Friday but the action of the water passing through the weir had “broken up” the water and he did not believe a fish kill was currently a risk. “We had, basically, oxygen levels below 1mg/L for extended periods of time – for 24, 48 hours in different sections,” he said. “And anywhere in the Darling, below two is high risk of fish mortality.” The New South Wales Department of Primary Industry’s and Environment was contacted for comment but did not respond to questions about oxygen readings at different stages of the river or reports of fish deaths. Blackwater events do occur naturally when river systems restart after long dry periods, but ANU professor Jamie Pittock said these events were “a natural risk that has been accelerated by poor management”. “Every few years a flood would take the leaf litter away. It’s been 10 years since the last one,” Pittock said. “It does occur naturally but the severity and frequency of these events is increasing as the environmental flows on the floodplain decrease. “The frequency of floods is decreasing because of the excessive amount of water being taken for agriculture and because of governments failing to implement the environmental flows they promised in the 2012 environmental management plan.” Pittock said a failure to regulate floodplain harvesting had also interrupted natural flooding events. While heavy flooding in northern NSW and south-east Queensland was causing the rivers to surge again, he said it would a mistake to treat the current situation as a “return to normal”. Climate change forecasts for the river system predict more severe droughts and floods, a process which is likely to increase the build-up of leaf litter over time. “That is likely to exacerbate blackwater events unless we make more substantial efforts to reduce that risk where we can through managed environmental flows,” Pittock said. NSWWater said the volume of releases into the Lower Darling downstream area was gradually being reduced from 18,000 megalitres a day down to 500 megalitres a day by the start of April. “The reduction in releases follows a prolonged period of higher releases into the Lower Darling, and is at a rate intended to maintain downstream flow while retaining as much water in the lakes at the end of the current inflow event, as required by operational regulations.”",News/Environment,Lethal ‘blackwater’ in Barwon-Darling river prompts fears of another mass fish kill,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/16/lethal-blackwater-in-barwon-darling-river-prompts-fears-of-another-mass-fish-kill
