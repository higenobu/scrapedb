2/4/2022,"Hello, Warren Murray here, endeavouring to provide the answers you need.  Four of Boris Johnson’s key staff have quit, led out of the blue by his longstanding policy chief Munira Mirza who used a stinging resignation letter to accuse the prime minister of “scurrilous” behaviour. She was followed by Dan Rosenfield, the No 10 chief of staff; Martin Reynolds, Johnson’s principal private secretary; and his director of communications, Jack Doyle – all three of whom have been implicated in Downing Street’s response to the lockdown parties. Reynolds sent a widely shared email urging staff to “bring your own booze” to one event on 20 May 2020. Mirza rebuked Johnson for falsely linking Keir Starmer to the failure to bring the paedophile Jimmy Savile to justice. Rishi Sunak also criticised the prime minister for his jibe – asked about the comments, the chancellor and possible Johnson successor said: “Being honest, I wouldn’t have said it.” Meanwhile a leaked Cabinet Office memo reveals civil service bosses may never know which of their staff are fined over partygate. Those concerned have been told it is “unlikely” their security clearance would be revoked if they were given a £100 fixed penalty notice. Southend West elects new MP – The Conservatives have as expected held on to the seat of Southend West after a byelection triggered by the killing of Sir David Amess. Anna Firth ran out as a comfortable winner with 86% of the vote after Labour, the Liberal Democrats and other mainstream political parties stood aside from the contest. Amess was killed on 15 October during a constituency surgery. Firth, a barrister, vowed to “work tirelessly to build on everything” achieved by Amess. Southend West, with its 66,354 registered voters, has been held by the Conservatives since its creation in 1950. Sunak promises bill relief – Rishi Sunak has told households suffering from Britain’s worsening cost of living crisis to brace themselves for further increases in energy costs later this year. Prompted by the average household paying an extra £700 a year for gas and electricity, the chancellor announced temporary, repayable discounts and council tax rebates that he insisted would help soften the blow. Critics said the £9bn emergency package was insufficient. The Resolution Foundation said millions more would plunge into fuel stress, where more than 10% of the household budget is spent on energy. The Bank of England meanwhile raised interest rates to 0.5% while warning that living standards were headed for their biggest hit in at least 30 years. The Bank predicts annual inflation – already 5.4% – will peak at more than 7% this spring. Next stop: road pricing – Motorists will have to pay by the mile to make up a £35bn tax shortfall as fuel duty revenue declines with the shift to electric vehicles, the Commons transport committee has said. MPs saw “no viable alternative” to road pricing and said work on bringing it in should start immediately. The MPs said new charges should entirely replace fuel duty and vehicle excise, with most motorists ending up paying the same or less. Drivers of electric vehicles should pay to maintain and use the roads, the MPs said, like petrol and diesel drivers do – although incentives to purchase cleaner vehicles must remain. The RAC Foundation backed the call but said the system must not be too complex or expensive. It suggested charges could be calculated and collected alongside vehicle insurance premiums. ‘Act of desperate cowardice’ – Joe Biden said US special forces had “successfully removed a major threat to the world” after the leader of the Islamic State, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi, blew himself up in a pre-dawn raid in Syria. Thirteen people were killed, including women and children, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Unicef has confirmed that at least six children died. Biden said that “as troops approached, in a final act of desperate cowardice”, Qurayshi blew up the third floor of a house, killing his own family members. Biden called Qurayshi “Haji Abdullah” and said he had been “the driving force” behind the genocide of the Yazidi people. Thursday’s raid was the most significant by the US since Qurayshi’s predecessor Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed in October 2019. ‘Life-saving’ – Children in England with the rare and fatal genetic condition MLD will soon be able to get the world’s most expensive drug after NHS bosses negotiated a substantial cut in its £2.8m price. The “life-saving” therapy called Libmeldy will go to the small number of babies and young children who have metachromatic leukodystrophy. Those who receive it will be able to enjoy a normal life, the NHS says. The disorder progressively and severely damages a child’s nervous system and organs. Around four children a year are born in England with MLD and usually only live for five to eight years. NHS England said clinical trials “have shown this treatment will deliver substantial health benefits”. Prof Andrew Hill, a drugs expert at Liverpool University, said it was is not clear if results upholding Libmeldy’s effectiveness were reliable. “Long-term follow up will be required to ensure that this drug is truly cost-effective at this high price.” Green grocers – Waitrose and Lidl are the most sustainable supermarkets, according to Which?’s eco-friendly grocer ranking. Iceland finished last, according to the research, which tracked supermarket policies on plastic waste, food waste, and greenhouse gas emissions. Waitrose has strong policies on plastic and food waste compared with other supermarkets, and scored reasonably for greenhouse gas emissions. Marks & Spencer was found to use a lot of plastic compared with other supermarkets. For plastic use, the Co-op did best, while Ocado was the frontrunner in terms of food waste, as it redistributes almost all surplus food. The full rankings are in our story.

Three big stories dominate Friday’s front pages – and none of them are good news for Boris Johnson. We have a separate wrap, of which a summary follows. The Mail says “Meltdown in Downing Street” above an image of a forlorn-looking prime minister and the subhead, “will the last one to leave please turn out the lights” evoking the Sun’s infamous 1992 election front page. Its front page also runs through the litany of disasters to strike Johnson’s ailing premiership: “Four aides go”, “Sunak puts knife into PM”, and “rates, energy bills and inflation soar”. The Guardian says “PM hit by No 10 exodus as four aides quit in one day”. It also reports that households are “braced for further fuel bill rises”. The Sun’s splash headline says “Ouch!” and then breaks out the strands of what is being dubbed “Black Thursday”. “Brits £2,417 poorer”, one subhead says, along with “Partygate bloodbath” and “Rishi knifes PM”. The Mirror says “They’re all laughing”, with a picture of the Tory frontbench sharing a joke in the Commons juxtaposed with some hard-hitting facts about the cost of living crisis. The i has a similar theme with “Johnson’s top team quits No 10 en masse”. The headline in the Times is “Britons facing biggest drop in living standards” and a large picture of the chancellor. It also has “Johnson doubts grow after aides quit and Sunak takes swipe”. The Telegraph has a splash headlined “The big squeeze” and another smaller story down the page saying “More pressure on Johnson as four top aides quit in one day”. Ditto the FT which has a main story saying “Household budgets suffer biggest blow in three decades”, and underneath it reports “Sunak distances himself from Johnson over Savile remarks as close aides quit”. The Express says “Tighten your belts … Britain in grip of biggest squeeze ever”. The Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.

2/4/2022,"A second serving member of the SAS has told a court he saw an Australian soldier shoot an unarmed disabled man during a 2009 raid in Afghanistan. The soldier, anonymised before the court as Person 14, said he saw an Australian soldier, wearing distinctive camouflage facepaint worn by the Roberts-Smith’s five-man patrol, throw an Afghan man to the ground.  “Then a soldier raised their Minimi F89 Para [machine gun] and fired an extended burst,” Person 14 said. “It was loud, like a ‘BRRRRRT’ for one second.” Later in the raid, Person 14 told the court he saw Roberts-Smith carrying a minimi machine gun, a distinctive weapon carried by few Australian soldiers on the raid. Most of the soldiers carried M4 rifles. “Later, I saw who had the para minimi [machine gun],” he said. “It was Ben Roberts-Smith.” The evidence of the anonymised soldier follows testimony from another soldier, Person 41, who said he saw Roberts-Smith “frog-march” a man outside a village compound, throw him to the ground and machine-gun him to death. The court has previously heard that the man had a prosthetic leg, which was later souvenired by another soldier and used as a drinking vessel at the Australian soldiers’ unofficial bar on base, the Fat Ladies’ Arms. The slain man was allegedly found hiding inside a tunnel inside the compound, but he was captive and unarmed at the time he was shot, the testimony before court has said. Roberts-Smith is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts Smith denies any wrongdoing. Before giving his evidence, Person 14 sought, and was granted by the judge, a certificate under section 128 of the Evidence Act, providing him immunity against prosecution based on self-incrimination. Person 14 was part of a raid by Australian soldiers on a compound – given the codename Whiskey 108 – on 12 April 2009, in the village of Kakarak in Uruzgan province. Person 14 said when other Australian troops became engaged in a firefight in the valley around Kakarak, the SAS soldiers provided “overwatch” and “battlefield commentary” to assist. Engaged in the battle all day, in the late afternoon, the decision was taken for the SAS troops to infiltrate Kakarak and “clear” two compounds of particular interest – known as Whiskey 108 and Whiskey 109 – checking for insurgents, weapons, and bomb-making materials. Person 14 gave evidence of leading his six-man patrol into Kakarak village in fading light, across watercourses, through poppy fields, and down narrow alleyways between buildings, before reaching the compounds. Person 14 “engaged” and killed a fighting aged male upon approach to the compounds and then set up an overwatch post while the assault patrols entered the compounds. Person 14 said the light was fading when he heard heavy footsteps to his right. “As I turned my head to my right, there were three Australian soldiers and a black object, which was similar to a human, that was thrown to the ground.” Person 14 said the person made a thudding, “expulsion of air” noise as they hit the ground. “Then a soldier raised their Minimi F89 Para and fired an extended burst. It was loud, like a ‘BRRRRRT’ for one second.” “That person turned and walked away out of sight back into Whiskey 108.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Person 14 said he turned to his patrol’s second-in-command and said “what the hell what that?” He said he did not recognise the soldier who fired at the time. But Person 14 said the soldier who shot the man was wearing a distinctive new camouflage paint, worn only by one SAS patrol in action that day, the five-man team of which Roberts-Smith was a member. Person 14 later checked the body of the slain man – he had gunshot wounds to the centre of his torso and blood coming from his mouth and nose. Person 14 saw that the man had a prosthetic leg. Later in the day, Person 14 told the court he saw Roberts-Smith carrying the distinctive minimi weapon at the troops’ lay-up point. “I saw who had the para minimi [machine gun],” he said. “It was Ben Roberts-Smith.” The events at Whiskey 108 on 12 April 2009 have emerged as central to the allegations made against Roberts-Smith, a Victoria Cross winner, and one of Australia’s most decorated soldiers. Earlier this week, another still-serving soldier in the SAS, Person 41, gave evidence he saw Roberts-Smith order another subordinate soldier to execute an elderly man also found in the same tunnel as the disabled man. He gave evidence he later saw Roberts-Smith kill the man with the prosthetic leg outside the compound. Roberts-Smith, in his evidence to the court last year, said “there were no people in the tunnel at Whiskey 108”. He said he never gave an order to execute anybody, and that killing never happened. Roberts-Smith says he killed the man with the prosthetic leg, but that the man was an insurgent, running outside the compound, and carrying a weapon. Roberts-Smith insists the man was a legitimate target, a threat to soldiers’ safety, and was killed within the laws of war. The trial, before Justice Anthony Besanko, continues.",News/Australia news,Second SAS member tells Ben Roberts-Smith trial he saw Australian soldier shoot unarmed man in Afghanistan,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/04/second-sas-member-tells-ben-roberts-smith-trial-he-saw-australian-soldier-shoot-unarmed-man-in-afghanistan
2/4/2022,"Waitrose and Lidl are the most sustainable supermarkets, according to a Which?’s eco-friendly grocer ranking. Iceland finished last, according to the research, which tracked supermarket policies on: plastic waste and food waste, which shoppers have reported are the biggest issues for them; and greenhouse gas emissions, which most experts say poses the greatest environmental threat.  In its first such ranking, the consumer magazine pointed out that supermarkets respond to customer demand, so if shoppers make eco-friendly choices and demand sustainable options, this can influence shops to improve. Harry Rose, editor of Which?, said: “We know that consumers increasingly want to shop sustainably and our in-depth analysis of three key areas shows that all the big supermarkets could be looking to make some improvements. “The good news is shoppers can make a big difference themselves by adopting more sustainable habits, such as buying loose fruit and vegetables, buying seasonal local produce, eating less meat and dairy and limiting their own food waste.” Lidl performed above its rivals on greenhouse gas emissions but fell short on food waste, though it said this is because it serves more fresh food in-store than many other comparable shops. Waitrose has strong policies on plastic and food waste compared with other supermarkets, and scored reasonably for greenhouse gas emissions. Iceland fell short because it was unable to report how much of its own-brand plastic is recyclable, so scored zero points. It also faces disadvantages as a frozen food specialist, as this made it the worst performer on operational greenhouse gas emissions due to its energy-draining in-store freezers. However, it does buy 100% renewable electricity for its UK sites. Marks & Spencer was found to use a lot of plastic compared with other supermarkets. It was also the only one unable to provide its food waste data in a comparable format, so scored zero points for this, and was in the bottom half of Which?’s table for emissions. For plastic use, the Co-op did best, while Ocado was the frontrunner in terms of food waste, as it redistributes almost all surplus food, leaving just 0.04% as waste. 1. Lidl – 74%1. Waitrose – 74%3.

2/4/2022,"Generally speaking, I’m a fan of what we might call the unlocked room mystery. The kind where someone is murdered or otherwise indisposed and we are then introduced to a wide variety of characters who may or may not have something to do with it or each other. Then all you have to do is wait patiently for the doughty police officers in charge to sniff out any red herrings and present you with the individual or web responsible. But ya gotta keep things tight and urgent if you’re going to pull off this kind of caper. The latest, Suspicion (Apple+ TV), is a loose, baggy thing that only begins to approach the necessary slickness a good quarter of the way through its eight-episode run.  It starts with a dramatically squandered kidnap. In the corridor of a New York hotel, a young man is quietly nabbed by three figures, wearing replica masks of the royal family, and unobtrusively stuffed in a suitcase – so unobtrusively that I didn’t notice until a second viewing – and wheeled out. He, we eventually learn, is Leo Newman, the student son of Katherine Newman, head of one of the world’s most influential communications companies and controversial nominee for a UK ambassadorship, possibly the two positions least likely to inculcate any feeling of fondness for a character. She is played by Uma Thurman, who appears so fleetingly that the PR team who made her role headline news deserve a special award for chutzpah. A video of the kidnapping is uploaded to the internet. While we wait for that to go viral, we are introduced to the quartet of apparently unconnected characters upon whose octet of shoulders the plot will hang. There is Oxford academic Tara (Elizabeth Henstridge), who has an activist streak born of her working-class and/or Mancunian origins (Suspicion seems to think these are more or less synonymous), a messy private life (according to her ex-husband), and an unrewarding tweenage daughter, Daisy. There is Nat (Georgina Campbell), who lives in Peckham, is about to get married and has a wad of cash and a burner phone hidden in her bedroom. She uses some of the former to pay off the loan shark pursuing her mother. She gets into a small, unexciting car chase with him for no narratively good reason but it fills an unforgiving minute or two. Then there’s Aadesh (Kunal Nayyar), who gives us our first link to Manhattan and the suitcase-based events therein. His furious wife questions why he made a secret trip to New York when he was supposed to be in Birmingham visiting family. I think the real question is why would you not go on a secret trip to New York rather than go to Birmingham to visit family, but Aadesh says he went to pitch his cybersecurity talents to a big US communications company which had asked to see him and who paid for him to stay in a posh, as yet unnamed, hotel. As his wife knows that he is ambitious and frustrated by his dead-end job in her father’s family business, and apparently doesn’t know how vanishingly unlikely this behaviour from a big US communications company would be, she accepts his account. Finally, there’s Sean (Elyes Gabel), who transforms his appearance on a plane from New York to Belfast by peeling off a fake beard and putting on a cap to evade the police waiting for him when he touches down. At the same time, local forces are fronting up to the other three with more success. By the second episode, they are under arrest and being interrogated, too lengthily to hold anyone’s interest but their own, but further links to the hotel, Newmans Leo and Katherine and potentially to each other are gradually revealed. As is the kidnappers’ demand, which turns out to be more numinous than the traditional “hundreds of thousands of dollars in used bills and a duffel bag, ma, or the kid gets it” and will take the National Crime Agency and FBI agents (Angel Coulby and Noah Emmerich) a bit longer to get together. Things liven up after that, and Suspicion finds more of its groove. If it never becomes more than a jigsaw – done by others, you just sit back and watch the picture take shape – that’s OK. It never promised to be anything else. Apart from an Uma Thurman vehicle, of course – but we should never have let ourselves be fooled by that at this late stage in the television viewing game.",Arts/Television & radio,Suspicion review – blink and you’ll miss Uma Thurman in this kidnap thriller,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/04/suspicion-review-blink-and-youll-miss-uma-thurman-in-this-kidnap-thriller
2/4/2022,"Social workers are warning of a rise in the number of children with mental health problems since the start of the pandemic, with official figures recording a 25% increase as successive lockdowns and school closures take a toll. Councils said they have “grave concerns” over the growing demand for help, with nearly 1,500 children a week presenting with mental health problems – an increase that could cost councils an extra £600m a year.  There were 77,390 children who had been assessed as having a mental health need by councils on 31 March 2021, an increase of 25% on the 61,830 seen two years earlier, according to statistics from the Department for Education. The pandemic has triggered increased pressure from gangs, through county line drug dealing networks, as well as sexual harassment, social workers reported. The most common problems remained the impact of a parent being subject to domestic violence and a parent’s poor mental health. The increase may be an undercount as there has also been a 31% slump in the number of referrals from schools – 36,000 fewer cases – reflective of the restrictions on school attendance in place for parts of the year to April 2021. “Hundreds of children every week are seen by social workers because they need help with their mental health and we expect these numbers to grow as the full impact of the pandemic is felt,” said Cllr Anntoinette Bramble, chair of the Local Government Association’s children and young people board. “This reinforces the importance of fully funding the whole system of children’s mental health support, including councils and the NHS, to make sure that children get the help they need, when they need it. That includes early help to prevent children reaching crisis point.” A pastoral care officer in a school in the south-west told the Guardian that on Thursday there were no social workers to whom to refer urgent cases. They said that more year 11 students than ever before, including the typically most successful, are asking for help with anxiety and stress triggered by exams. “These children were 14 when home schooling started,” they said. “At that age a lot of them weren’t capable of learning remotely effectively. Students are suffering, breaking down, fearing they’re not going to achieve in subjects they want to do well in. Others have simply switched off.” Rebekah Pierre, professional officer with the British Association of Social Workers, said an increase in domestic abuse during lockdowns was made worse for children by the lack of a safety net provided by schools. She said social workers had seen more referrals when lockdowns or school holidays ended. Online child sexual exploitation has “never been worse” and may have resulted in increases in self-harm. “Children are feeling anxious and there is almost a grief about what they have lost through Covid,” she said. Separate NHS figures showed that in 2021, one in six children in England had a probable mental disorder, up from one in nine in 2017, with girls aged between 11 and 16 more likely to have experienced a decline in mental health than boys the same age. The proportion of 11- to 16-year-olds with eating problems almost doubled from 2017 to 2021. Thirteen per cent of 11- to 16-year-olds and 24% of 17- to 23-year-olds felt their lives had been made “much worse” by coronavirus restrictions. The most common factors recorded by social workers handling cases of children in need were concerns a parent was subject to domestic violence, the parent’s mental health, emotional abuse, neglect, concerns about the mental health of the child, drug use by parents and domestic violence against the child.",News/Society,Social workers warn of rise in mental health problems among children ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/04/social-workers-warn-of-rise-in-mental-health-problems-among-children
2/4/2022,"Landsat 9 has completed its post-launch assessment and begun its operational phase. Launched from the Vandenberg Space Force Base in California on 27 September 2021, Landsat 9 is a joint venture between Nasa and the US Geological Survey (USGS). The Landsat programme has been running since the 1970s and will pass its 50th anniversary of unbroken images of Earth from orbit later this year. Landsat 1 was launched on 23 July 1972 and was initially called the Earth Resources Technology Satellite.  Landsat 8 was launched on 11 February 2013. To prepare Landsat 9 for operations, it has been working in tandem with its predecessor, taking simultaneous images of the Earth so the datasets can be compared and the instruments calibrated to give identical readings to each another. This allows the data to be used as a seamless timeline in environmental and climate research studies. Nasa led the commissioning phase, and the USGS will handle operations, archiving and distribution of the data. Landsat 9 carries two instruments.

2/4/2022,"Children in England with a rare and fatal genetic condition will soon be able to get the world’s most expensive drug after NHS bosses negotiated a substantial cut in its £2.8m price. NHS England hailed the deal that will make the “life-saving” therapy, called Libmeldy, available to the small number of babies and young children who have metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD). Those who receive it will be able to enjoy a normal life, it said.  The inherited neurodegenerative disorder severely damages a child’s nervous system and organs. Sufferers experience progressive disability similar to that caused by multiple sclerosis. Symptoms include spasticity, seizures and difficulty talking, swallowing, hearing and seeing. The condition is fatal and children diagnosed with MLD usually only live for five to eight years. NHS England said it will make Libmeldy available from this spring after talks with its manufacturer, the drug company Orchard, led to it securing a “significant confidential discount”. Around four children a year are born in England with the condition. Those who receive the therapy will do so at the Centre for Genomic Medicine at Saint Mary’s hospital in Manchester. “This revolutionary drug is a life-saver for the babies and young children who suffer from this devastating hereditary disorder and will spare their families untold heartache and grief”, said Amanda Pritchard, NHS England’s chief executive. “The deal we have struck is just the latest example of NHS England using its commercial capabilities to make good on the NHS Long term Plan commitment to provide patients with cutting-edge treatments and therapies at a price that is fair to taxpayers.” NHS England said that clinical trials “have shown this treatment will deliver substantial health benefits, drastically improving the patient’s quality of life and life expectancy, giving them the prospect of a normal life”. Babies and young children who have not yet shown clinical signs or symptoms of MLD will be able to receive Libmeldy, as will those showing early signs, provided that they can still walk independently and show no signs of cognitive decline. Nicola Elson from Cumbria’s daughter Connie and son Joe were both found to have MLD. They were referred to a clinical trial of Libmeldy taking place in Milan. Connie did not meet the entry criteria and deteriorated. But her brother – now 11 – was treated during a five-month stay in Italy and now attends school and is both a physical and academic match for his peers, his mother said. “When I found out the treatment was being offered on the NHS I was so emotional and cried happy tears. I’m overjoyed and, having witnessed the suffering my daughter has endured, I don’t want another family to go through this,” she said. However, Prof Andrew Hill, a drugs expert at Liverpool University, warned that NHS England had struck the deal despite the evidence for Libmeldy’s effectiveness being questionable. “This is a very high price, but MLD has a very poor prognosis”. He added: “The main clinical trials used for approval [of Libmeldy] are not randomised. There are many examples of misleading results from other non-randomised trials. So it is not clear if the results are reliable. “Approving drugs at high prices without properly randomised trials sets a dangerous precedent. Long-term follow up will be required to ensure that this drug is truly cost-effective at this high price.”",News/Society,Children in England with fatal condition to get world’s most expensive drug,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/04/children-in-england-with-fatal-condition-to-get-worlds-most-expensive-drug
2/4/2022,"In writing about politics you can either try to explain what you think is happening or you can say what you think should happen. Right now, there is a complete convergence between the two. Boris Johnson’s premiership is on the slide, irreversibly so. The question is not whether Johnson will go. It is when and how – and what will come after. Simultaneously it is increasingly plain that Johnson should go. Some take this view for partisan reasons or because Johnson’s personality appals them. Fair enough. But that’s not my argument here. There is also an extremely powerful Conservative case against him remaining. In the end, this will be decisive, because he will only go only if it is in the Tory party’s interest; no one else’s.  However the main reason why Johnson should depart is now moral, systemic and governmental, rather than political. His increasingly reckless, and even Trumpian, response to it has now led to the resignation of Munira Mirza, No 10’s policy chief, who described a recent attack on Keir Starmer as beyond “the normal cut and thrust of politics”. It’s about the way the current crisis shows how he sees his job, and about the way he does it. He sees himself as above the system. He should not. His approach cannot coexist for much longer with being a prime minister of a stable and healthy parliamentary democracy. There is too much at stake. Much has been said this week about how the dangers to Johnson’s position may have lifted a little. That may be true in the short run, although every time anyone says this a new danger pops up. In the longer term, the danger is as great as ever. The simple but profound truth is that the law is above Johnson, not the other way around. As Keir Starmer hinted this week, the police investigation may yet end in the conviction of a prime minister, an event without modern precedent. It is clear that Johnson would try to brush that aside. He appears ready to argue that a fixed-penalty notice for a breach of lockdown rules would no more call his position as prime minister into question than a parking fine. But the Tory party is almost certainly not so far gone that it would permit this. Tobias Ellwood’s words this week – “We’re better than this” – would become the rallying cry, and rightly so. Johnson is blind to rules and dismissive of them. But he is also more devious about why they should not apply to him than is sometimes understood. This is fundamentally because he sees himself as an autonomous individual unburdened by the obligations or conventions that others uphold. It means he believes rules do not matter, and it means that in government he is not the first among equals, as the constitutional orthodoxy would have it, but very much the first above subordinates. This is why he has constructed his government the way he has, with a cabinet composed mainly of sycophants and second-order ministers; with a centralised No 10 operation that overrides departments and undermines their ethos; and with senior civil servants, like ministers, too often chosen for their deference to the man at the centre rather than for their readiness to argue a case. It is also why Johnson governs not through his control of Whitehall or the House of Commons but through the No 10 media operation. It is why he spends so much time making photo-opportunity visits to hospitals and construction sites accompanied by his seemingly bottomless dressing-up box. It is why he built the press briefing suite in Downing Street. It is why he flew to Kyiv on Tuesday. It is why, in Jacob Rees-Mogg’s highly revealing claim, government in the Johnson era is more presidential than parliamentary. Johnson’s attitude to the ministerial code offers an example of this approach. Starmer asked Johnson last week if the code applied to him. Johnson replied that it did. But there is a good case for suspecting Johnson really believes otherwise. In the code, ministers are subject to the rules, but the prime minister himself is the code’s arbiter and guardian. It is he, and he alone, who decides if there has been a breach. Johnson knows this. It is how he overrode his standards adviser in the Priti Patel bullying case. It is also the case he would make if Sue Gray were convinced in her final report that he had lied to parliament. The ethos of the code undoubtedly means that a prime minister should resign for lying. But the letter of the code gives a prime minister the wriggle room to claim to be the judge in their own case. All of this is at one with the way Johnson conducts himself as the head of government. Constitutionally, he owes the prime ministership to the support of parliament (which is why MPs can and will in the end throw him out). But Johnson sees the 2019 election victory as a personal mandate that bypasses MPs. This is why Rees-Mogg and others have claimed that there would have to be a general election if the Tories chose themselves a new leader. It is completely untrue, but it is how Johnson thinks of it. Something similar surfaced again in Johnson’s revealing response to Gray’s interim report this week. In the face of Gray’s finding of “failures of leadership and judgment”, Johnson announced that “I get it and I will fix it.” But he doesn’t and he won’t. Beefing up the No 10 operation and centralising government around himself even more firmly are the opposite of what he needs to do. This week’s “levelling up” white paper provided an example of another systemic failing in Johnson’s solipsistic approach to government. Make no mistake, levelling up is and could be a big idea. Potentially it is as big an idea as Brexit in its importance to sustaining the electoral realignment that Johnson achieved in 2019. But the white paper shows that levelling up is still more of a phrase than a policy, rather as Brexit also was. The plans do not come close to addressing the scale and intricacy of the problems involved in the nation’s inequalities and uneven opportunities. Without new money, amid large doses of Thatcherite Tory scepticism on the backbenches, and hampered by Johnson’s preference for performative rather than effective presidentialism, it will not do the job either economically or politically. Johnson owes his prime ministership to running against Britain’s governing system. But at no time has he had an alternative system to put in place for changing Britain – beyond himself and his performance. He is now doubling down on that same approach, even though it will make all the problems worse. This is now an irreparably destructive prime ministership, not just to Johnson and his party, but to government more generally, to the public’s needs, to the country’s reputation and even to the survival of the state.

Hannah Verdier Normal GossipPandemic phone conversations made Kelsey McKinney miss gossip. Not the celebrity type, but those little morsels that you share about your workmate’s sister. So she launched a podcast celebrating damage-free gossip with guests who share tangled tales about neighbours and the backstory of pandemic boyfriends. HV Chosen by Madeleine Finlay Recently I went back to This American Life, having not listened in a good few years. It felt a little bit like returning to the town you grew up in, as even now, so much of the way podcasts are narrated and constructed – from the music to the “I’m just going to switch my recorder on, is that okay?” b-roll tape – originates from This American Life. Luckily, the episode I happened to click on, Dr. Gilmer and Mr. Hyde, would definitely be described as a This American Life classic. Dr. Gilmer and Mr. Hyde tells the story of two doctors; Dr. Vince Gilmer, who worked at a rural clinic in North Carolina before killing his own father and going to prison, and Dr. Benjamin Gilmer, who later joined the clinic only to discover he shares his name with the previous physician. As Benjamin learns more about his predecessor’s kindness and generosity, he finds it harder and harder to understand. How could this man have committed murder? Joined by reporter Sarah Koenig, they try to investigate who Vince really was, and what really happened. The result is a fascinating and surprising journey into a small town, medical diagnoses within the justice system, and how one man’s life can radically change another’s. The episode is actually a repeat, first broadcast in 2013. This is pre-Serial Sarah Koenig, although it will sound very familiar to any Serial fans. But, there’s a good reason to listen now – almost a decade on there’s been an update on Vince’s case (I won’t spoil it for you). Don’t read anything into Cate Blanchett’s recent role as a blithe TV anchor in climate crisis satire Don’t Look Up. She’s about to launch a podcast devoted to her love of the environment. Climate of Change sees her team up eco entrepreneur and activist Danny Kennedy and will launch on Audible in April.

2/4/2022,"We were walking along the hollow way when we heard it – kronk, kronk, kronk – the unmistakable, resonant call of a raven. It’s a sound I’m very familiar with from visits to the Scottish Highlands, but not one I’ve encountered on home ground, so at first I could barely believe what I was hearing. Looking up through the leafless branches, we saw the bird flying low overhead. There was no mistaking the diamond-shaped tail, heavy bill, barrel chest and long, thickset neck, which was ruffed with shaggy-looking throat feathers known as hackles. If I had any lingering doubts about the bird’s identity, they were quickly cast aside when two carrion crows left their treetop perches and began mobbing the interloper. The pair were dwarfed. With a wingspan measuring between 120cm and 150cm, and weighing up to 1.5kg, ravens are even bigger than buzzards.  Following decades of persecution by gamekeepers and egg collectors, and the capture of nestlings for the pet trade, this once widespread species was pushed to near extinction throughout lowland Britain by the mid-19th century. The population slowly increased during the mid-20th century, with birds leaving their upland strongholds to recolonise much of their former range. But until relatively recently, ravens remained occasional winter visitors to this area. During the past 10 years, they have become breeding residents, with pairs nesting on Portsdown Hill, Chichester cathedral (to the consternation of the resident peregrine falcons) and the Stansted Park estate, which lies less than five miles from my local patch. British ravens are largely sedentary, but juveniles disperse during their first winter, so it’s possible that this individual came from one of these natal sites. One crow dived down, attempting to strike the raven’s back with outstretched claws. The other swooped in from the side, but both were elegantly outmanoeuvred by their larger cousin, which tucked in one wing and flipped upside down, half-rolling out of their way. Righting itself on the next flowing wingbeat, the raven soared across the fields. As it banked towards the cemetery, sunlight glanced off its wings, the glossy black plumage displaying an iridescent petrol-blue and purple sheen.
