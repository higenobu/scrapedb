3/15/2022,"By Mark Trevelyan LONDON (Reuters) - Russia said on Sunday that it was counting on China to help it withstand the blow to its economy from Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine, but the United States warned Beijing not to provide that lifeline. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said sanctions had deprived Moscow of access to $300 billion of its $640 billion in gold and foreign exchange reserves, and added that there was pressure on Beijing to shut off more. â€œWe have part of our gold and foreign exchange reserves in the Chinese currency, in yuan. And we see what pressure is being exerted by Western countries on China in order to limit mutual trade with China. Of course, there is pressure to limit access to those reserves,"" he said. ""But I think that our partnership with China will still allow us to maintain the cooperation that we have achieved, and not only maintain, but also increase it in an environment where Western markets are closing."" Western countries have imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia's corporate and financial system since it invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it calls a special military operation. Siluanov's comments in a TV interview marked the clearest statement yet from Moscow that it will seek help from China to cushion the impact. But U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Washington was warning China not to provide it. ""We are communicating directly, privately to Beijing, that there will absolutely be consequences for large-scale sanctions, evasion efforts or support to Russia to backfill them,"" Sullivan told CNN. ""We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a lifeline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country, anywhere in the world,"" added Sullivan, who is due to meet China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi in Rome on Monday. Russia and China have tightened cooperation in recent times as both have come under strong Western pressure over human rights and a raft of other issues. Beijing has not condemned Russia's attack on Ukraine and does not call it an invasion, but it has urged a negotiated solution. Presidents Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping met in Beijing on Feb. 4 and announced a strategic partnership they said was aimed at countering the influence of the United States, describing it as a friendship with no limits. China is Russia's top export market after the European Union. Russian exports to China were worth $79.3 billion in 2021, with oil and gas accounting for 56% of that, according to China's customs agency.

3/15/2022,"By Stephanie Kelly NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Sunday at the start of the session, extending last week's decline, as a U.S. official said Russia was showing signs it might be willing to have substantive negotiations over Ukraine. Brent crude futures fell $1.82, or 1.6%, to $110.85 a barrel by 6:47 p.m. ET (2247 GMT). WTI crude futures fell $2.41, or 2.2%, to $106.92 a barrel. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February, which Moscow calls a ""special operation,"" has roiled energy markets globally. Brent last week was down 4.8% after hitting $139.13 on March 7. U.S. crude recorded a weekly drop of 5.7% after touching a high of $130.50 on March 7. Both contracts last touched those price peaks in 2008. [O/R] Investors have been concerned about a tighter oil market following Russia's action. Prices fell last week as traders assessed potential improvements to the supply outlook that has been disrupted by the Ukraine crisis. Russia is showing signs it might be willing to have substantive negotiations over Ukraine, even as Moscow is intent on ""destroying"" its neighbor, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said on Sunday. Russia-Ukraine talks are not taking place right now but will continue on Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying on Sunday by the RIA news agency. Peskov made the comments after Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said Ukraine and Russia were actively conducting talks on Sunday. Russia said on Sunday it was counting on China to help it withstand the economic blow from Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine, but the United States warned Beijing not to provide that lifeline. U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who is due to meet with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi in Rome on Monday, warned Beijing it would ""absolutely"" face consequences if it helped Moscow evade sweeping sanctions over the war in Ukraine.

3/15/2022,"March 13 (Reuters) - Bermuda's aviation regulator said it is suspending certification of many Russian airplanes in the British overseas territory due to international sanctions over the war in Ukraine. ""International sanctions on the aviation sector have had a significant impact on the ability to sustain safety oversight on Russian-operated aircraft,"" Bermuda's Civil Aviation Authority said on its website https://bit.ly/3Iai2st late on Saturday. No air carrier is permitted to fly without a certificate of airworthiness, which is issued by the civil aviation authority in the country where it is registered. The regulator said it is ""unable to confidently approve these aircraft as being airworthy"", and therefore as of late March 12, ""suspended all Certificates of Airworthiness of those aircraft operating under the Article 83bis Agreement between Bermuda and the Russian Federation"". Mutual air closures by the European Union and Moscow over the war in Ukraine have left Russian aviation in near isolation. Sanctions imposed by the EU in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine give leasing firms until March 28 to free themselves from deals with Russian airlines. BCAA's move furthers piles on the pressure since most of the foreign-owned planes operated by Russian carriers under lease are registered in Bermuda. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and ""de-Nazify"" the country.
