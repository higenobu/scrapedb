3/18/2022,"Good morning. In a phone call today, Joe Biden will warn his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, that he will face “costs” if Beijing rescues fellow authoritarian ally Russia from intense western sanctions aimed at punishing Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The Biden-Xi call at 9am, the first since a video summit in November, will be a chance to air differences as the US spearheads an unprecedented pressure campaign on Russia, placing China in a geopolitical bind. “It’s an opportunity for President Biden to assess where President Xi stands,” the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said. Early this morning, air raid sirens sounded in the western Ukraine city of Lviv, followed by the sound of explosions and a column of smoke, a few miles from the city centre. How are the peace negotiations going? Not well. Russia was accused by the UK, US, France, Albania, Ireland and Norway of war crimes, and Paris claimed Vladimir Putin was only pretending to be interested in negotiating a peace deal. Did anyone survive the theatre shelling in Mariupol? Yes. It looks like the basement, which was used as a bomb shelter, held. About 130 people have been rescued so far from the basement, officials said. What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 23 of the invasion. Weeks after the 2020 election, at least one Trump White House aide was named as secretly producing a report that alleged Donald Trump lost to Biden because of Dominion voting systems – research that formed the basis of the former president’s wider efforts to overturn the election. The Dominion report was initially prepared so it could be sent to legislatures in states where the Trump White House was trying to have Biden’s win reversed. But top Trump officials would also use the research to weigh other options to return Trump to the presidency, including having the former president sign off on executive orders to authorize sweeping emergency powers. The previously unreported involvement of the Trump White House aide in the preparation of the Dominion report raises the extraordinary situation of at least one administration official being among the original sources of Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Who wrote the report? The publicly available version of the Dominion report names as its author Katherine Friess, a volunteer on the Trump post-election legal team. But it was in fact produced by the senior Trump White House policy aide Joanna Miller, according to the original version of the document. Three current and former members of the Tennessee national guard, who were falsely identified in a Russian media report as mercenaries killed in Ukraine, are in fact alive and well, the Tennessee national guard said yesterday. Biden ordered the withdrawal of US troops from Ukraine prior to Russia’s invasion of the country as part of a broader effort to avoid a direct confrontation with the nuclear-armed adversary. But the report published in Russia’s Pravda newspaper identified the Americans by name and gave military ranks for each of them, citing information from pro-Russian militia in Donetsk, Ukraine. The report even offered an intricate explanation for how the three were identified, using items from a backpack “near the remains of one of the militants” – including a Tennessee state flag. What has the Tennessee guard said? A statement read: “They are accounted for, safe – and not, as the article headline erroneously states, US mercenaries killed in Donetsk People’s Republic.” Where are they? A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said two of the men were still in the Tennessee national guard and in Tennessee. The other man had left the service but was alive and accounted for – and not in Ukraine. Kanye “Ye” West has been suspended from Instagram for 24 hours, after he used a racial slur to describe the TV presenter Trevor Noah. A spokesperson for Instagram’s parent company Meta told TMZ and HuffPost that the suspension was due to West violating the company’s policy on hate speech, bullying and harassment. Prepare for the next surge or variant as Covid is not yet endemic in US, experts warn. Several countries in Europe are seeing another surge now and early indicators suggest the US might be next – with scientists watching the BA.2 variant especially closely. A Californian man died nearly two years ago as he screamed “I can’t breathe” while multiple officers restrained him as they tried to take a blood sample, according to records and a video. The newly released clip shows Edward Bronstein being forced to a mat with at least five officers holding him down. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has put huge pressure on an already shrinking pot of international aid. Commenting on Yemen recently, the executive director of the World Food Programme, David Beasley, said: “We have no choice but to take food from the hungry to feed the starving.” A 13-year-old was driving the pickup truck that struck a van in West Texas in a fiery collision that killed nine people, including six members of a college golf team and their coach, a National Transportation Safety Board official said yesterday. The child and a man traveling in the truck also died. Independent testing has found hundreds of popular personal care items in the US to be contaminated with benzene, a highly carcinogenic chemical, prompting several big brands to voluntarily recall dozens of products in recent months. The findings suggest benzene contamination is widespread and is probably in more products that have not yet been tested, says David Light, Valisure’s chief executive. To date, Valisure has tested 662 items and found the chemical in 180, or about 27%, of products. The idea of optimizing school district property for evening and weekend use isn’t new, but Buena Vista Horace Mann K-8 Community school appears to be the first modern public elementary school to have hosted a long-term, overnight family shelter, Gail Cornwall in San Francisco, for the Hechinger Report, writes. “As far as our knowledge in the entire country, we are the first people to do it,” Hillary Ronen, the San Francisco city supervisor, said. For five years, Frederick Chukwuemeze had the grim task of treating children poisoned by lead in Anka, a mining town in north-west Nigeria. Since 2010, more than 600 children have died from lead poisoning in Zamfara state and hundreds more have been left with brain damage and physical disabilities as a result of hazardous artisanal gold mining. But no child has died on his watch since October last year, thanks to a joint effort between local and international agencies that has virtually wiped out lead poisoning cases in the state. Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker and one of the most powerful Democrats in the country, has marked St Patrick’s Day by reading aloud a poem by Bono that referenced St Patrick’s banishment of snakes from Ireland and the current situation in Ukraine. “I got this message this morning from Bono,” Pelosi said of U2’s lead singer. Pelosi then read out Bono’s poem. The moment has gone viral and the poem ridiculed. First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday. If you’re not already signed up, subscribe now.

3/18/2022,"British business has long been a powerhouse across the globe – in fact, the UK ranks sixth in the world for export activity. But while multinational operations from Land Rover to Burberry may dominate the headlines with their sizeable exports, British SMEs make their mark worldwide too. In fact, SMEs made up 85% of all exporting businesses in the UK in 2020, and just under one in five micro businesses exported goods or services in the year to April 2021. “People aren’t aware of the number of SMEs that export,” says James Sibley, head of international affairs at the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB). “And that’s true within the community as well – we talk to owners who are sending goods and services internationally but don’t think of themselves as exporters.” The benefits of selling internationally can be significant. Research shows that businesses that export grow at twice the rate of those that don’t. Product and service innovation is often also quicker and more advanced, with international perspectives providing valuable insight. “Businesses that export are often the ones that are more productive, they employ more, they have higher revenue,” Sibley says. “Domestically the UK is a very competitive market. This is a way to find new customers. We see a lot of appetite and interest in it.” Lesley Batchelor is the former director general of the Institute of Export and International Trade, and now leads workshops and boot camps, teaching business owners how to gain traction in global markets. For entrepreneurs looking to export to new markets for the first time, she says research is hugely important. “You need to find out what’s going on in that market, whether you’re pitching a price correctly, what the competition is doing, whether your goods can even be sold in that country and other legal implications. Think about how much it costs to get your goods there, whether you’ll use distributors or an agent, and any extra costs you’ll incur. You might need to consider packaging changes or new delivery channels. Don’t just wing it.” Advice can be found in a variety of places, says Sibley. “One of the best things you can do is talk to your peers, those businesses that have been there and done it. Make sure you’re going into a particular market with your eyes open.” A range of resources, including government help, are also available. Maria-Yassin Jah, co-founder and CEO of Aspuna Group, is one of the many examples of British SMEs exporting their products, be they goods or services, around the world. She founded her social-impact commodities business in 2016 with two friends she met while studying for an executive MBA at the University of Cambridge. With backgrounds in commodities, they “knew that the communities where raw materials originated were failing to benefit from the value they produced”, says Jah. This knowledge underpins their focus on creating ethical supply chains to international markets. The London-headquartered company looks to build processing capacity within rural communities, and has factories in the Gambia, Nigeria and Tanzania that allow smallholder farmers to process crops such as cassava, potato and maize. The team now uses its expertise and technical knowledge to partner with other entrepreneurs seeking to open crop-processing factories in sub-Saharan Africa. Aspuna leads the design, development and implementation of new factories, and provides branding, market and retail sales support for those wishing to explore the European retail sector (through its partner company The Aké Collective). The company is also working on new opportunities in Sierra Leone, Ghana and Namibia. The benefits of exporting their project-development services have been significant, Jah says. “Partnering with local entrepreneurs allows us to be much more embedded into the communities in a way that we couldn’t if we just came in as a foreign investor. British business, I think, is certainly associated with quality and professionalism but also an element of flexibility in the way we approach business. Our cultural agility has been welcomed.” They have built relationships partly through taking advantage of their own networks via the University of Cambridge but also through the Department for International Trade (DIT). “DIT has been really helpful to us as a trusted entity, particularly in countries where we’ve not had any dealings before, and sometimes not even travelled to previously,” says Jah. “[Africa] is full of great opportunities, but it’s important you have someone you can trust to make connections for you.” A recent study found that 375,000 UK SMEs have exportable goods but are not currently selling internationally. The first step to exporting is to have confidence in your company’s ability to have an impact far and wide, says Sibley. “If you’ve got a viable product or service, there’s going to be a market for it somewhere around the world.” For more information about how to start selling internationally or grow your company’s international markets, visit great.gov.uk",Going global with business,From small beginnings to selling overseas: how SMEs are driving UK exports,https://www.theguardian.com/going-global-with-business/2022/mar/18/from-small-beginnings-to-selling-overseas-how-smes-are-driving-uk-exports
3/18/2022,"“We believe that businesses can only be successful if they prioritise their biggest competitive advantage – their people.” So said DP World in its annual report for 2021, demonstrating once again that companies will spout any old rubbish in pursuit of a socially responsible halo. The Dubai-owned company, via its P&O Ferries subsidiary, showed on Thursday what its “duty of care” to members of its “corporate family” really means. It sacked 800 UK employees with immediate effect via pre-recorded video message. Employment lawyers wondered whether the action was legal but, even if it is, it’s a shocking way to behave. P&O Ferries is losing money – £105m in 2020, according to the accounts for the relevant local holding company – but DP World itself is one of the world’s biggest logistics firms and recorded top-line earnings of $3.8bn (£2.9bn) last year. It ought to be able to handle a £100m crisis in a minor subsidiary in a calm manner and without resorting to such extreme tactics. It may be correct that P&O doesn’t have much of a future without a major restructuring but, come on, you’re more likely to achieve your aim if you signal your plans in advance and negotiate. Almost as grubby was the blindsiding of the UK government. P&O merely issued vague warnings via Twitter of “a major announcement” in the offing, despite knowing that its action would mean days of disruption at ports for haulage companies and travellers, including on the critical Dover-Calais route. According to the same annual report, DP World is also in the business of building “long-lasting relationships with governments”. Except when it isn’t. The company’s other UK investments include London Gateway, one of those freeports that are supposed to power economic regeneration via public-private partnerships. Ministers may wish to tell DP World that its services will not be required when the next freeport is up for grabs. Get ready for an inflation rate of 10% later this year, a sight not seen in the UK since the early 1990s. That outlook is now endorsed as roughly credible by the Bank of England, the same people who thought as recently as last month that the peak would arrive soon and be 7.25%. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a fresh round of soaring energy prices, and more supply chain disruption have up-ended month-old assumptions that already looked wobbly. Thus we are in a land where inflation could end up being “several percentage points higher” than the Bank expected only last month. In the circumstances, the mini surprise is that nobody on the Bank’s nine-strong panel wanted heavier action than a quarter-point rise in interest rates to 0.75%. Indeed, the deputy governor, Jon Cunliffe, preferred to stick at 0.5%. This was a very cautious version of an interest rate increase. Complacency on stilts? That accusation will arrive from one quarter for the understandable reason that sub-1% borrowing costs, at first glance, looks like tokenism if you seriously expect inflation to be at double-digit levels within the year. The danger lies in allowing inflation expectations to run wild, igniting a wages and price spiral. Yet the critical line in the Bank’s minutes was probably this: “Further out, inflation was expected to fall back materially, and possibly to a greater extent than had been expected in the February report.” Well, quite. The peak grabs headlines but what happens thereafter matters as much. Energy bills are virtually guaranteed to rise again in October (by about another £1,000, if nothing changes) but they cannot keep increasing forever. In the meantime, the severe squeeze of living standards will eventually generate deflationary forces. The risk of a wage spiral looks modest when growth is already expected to slow to 1.25% in 2023. But the implied message in the Bank’s relative restraint on rates is that growth forecasts could go even lower when next revised in May. The US Federal Reserve is being more hawkish on rates, but the Russia-related energy shock to its economy looks less severe than the one facing Europe. Let us hope Rishi Sunak is taking notice. It is the chancellor’s job to soften the hit to households’ budgets, and there is every reason to think the economic pain from energy prices will be acute. The Bank’s quarter-point tweak on the rate lever, as opposed to a half-point yank, is justified. Next year’s growth challenge looks more daunting than this year’s inflation drama.",News/Business,P&O Ferries sackings show its corporate responsibility is all at sea,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/mar/17/inflation-hit-10-per-cent-bank-of-england-soaring-energy-prices
3/18/2022,"The long-awaited release from detention in Iran of two UK-Iranian dual nationals, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori, signals, on the face of it, a constructive turn in UK-Iranian relations. It was brought about by the tireless behind-the-scenes work of advocates and officials , from progress in the Vienna nuclear talks to support from the Omani government and an international public pressure campaign. Yet, despite this step forward, more challenging issues between Tehran and Whitehall are looming. Not least is the fear that by paying its 40-year-old £400m debt to Iran, the British government risks vindicating Iran’s use of hostage-taking. It is for this reason that since Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s detention, the British government has been rightfully reluctant to link the prospect of her release to the debt. Indeed, in 2016, then US president Barack Obama was heavily criticised for a similar repayment of $400m to Tehran after the release of four US-Iranian dual nationals. To comply with sanctions and counter-terrorism and money laundering regulations – and to prevent a repeat of the Obama optics – the Foreign Office has announced that the UK debt money has been ringfenced, and will be used for humanitarian purposes only. However, hostage-taking remains an ongoing issue. The FCDO currently advises British-Iranian dual nationals against travelling to Iran, and two are still trapped there: Mehran Raoof has been sentenced to 10 years in prison on national security charges, and environmental activist and campaigner Morad Tahbaz – who also holds US citizenship – was granted furlough from prison but cannot leave Iran. Tahbaz is reportedly being treated as a US detainee by the Iranian government. His case, alongside those of Siamak and Baquer Namazi, Karan Vafadari and Afarin Neyssari remain in limbo, and are connected to the outcome of the continuing nuclear negotiations between the US and Iran. The Biden administration returned to the negotiating table in April 2021, leading to the slight progress that played a part in the release of Ashoori and Zaghari-Ratcliffe. These nuclear talks hold the key to Iran’s future on the world stage, and to whether its nuclear programme continues to ramp up. The UK’s debt repayment had been further delayed by the Trump administration’s 2018 withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement (the JCPOA), along with the maximum-pressure sanctions it imposed on Iran. Yet Despite Trump’s withdrawal from the deal and Tehran’s subsequent nuclear accelerations – which have reduced Iran’s nuclear “breakout time” from one year to a number of months – the UK, alongside France and Germany, worked to hold what was an effective multilateral deal together through the trying Trump years. After 11 months of negotiations, the end of the nuclear talks is indeed within sight, but last-minute issues require resolution. It is expected that most of the Trump-era sanctions imposed on Iran will be removed in exchange for Tehran’s return to the limits agreed in the original 2015 nuclear deal. Most importantly, Iran’s programme would again be subject to the oversight and monitoring of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Yet last week, Russia, which has thus far been a constructive party in the negotiations, attempted to sabotage their progress by demanding written guarantees to protect its participation in the deal from Ukraine-related sanctions. This was resolved when the Biden administration provided Moscow with the necessary assurances that sanctions over Ukraine would not hamper their cooperation and support of the agreement. What remains now is for the negotiators to finalise the last remaining sticking points and return to Vienna. In the final stretch, Tehran has final demands: it is seeking more precise economic guarantees to protect the JCPOA should a future US president again withdraw from the deal, along with the removal of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps from the US list of terrorist groups. These are not straightforward concessions for the US. Republican opposition to the JCPOA and criticism of the Biden administration’s negotiations with Tehran in a critical election year continue to tie the president’s hands in making bold concessions – and the IRGC’s flagrant missile attack last weekend in Erbil, Iraq will be hard for the US, UK and Europe to overlook. Arriving at a deal will require all sides to weigh the progress that’s been made against the spiralling risks of a collapse. A no-deal scenario would no doubt see Tehran accelerate its nuclear programme further, and would increase regional tensions, particularly with Israel. Gulf Arab states are also legitimately concerned that Iran’s regional activities remain unchecked. The UAE and Saudi Arabia in particular have been made vulnerable to missile strikes from the Yemen-based, Iran-backed Houthi group. Regardless of the deal or no-deal scenarios, fragile regional security dynamics require attention and support from the international community. The release of Zaghari-Ratcliff and Ashoori should be seen as an important turning point in the UK’s dealings with Iran – but we are still far from resolution.

3/18/2022,"As the far right in America seeks to increase its political influence, including by seeking elected office, one figure is emerging as potentially its most powerful figure: Idaho’s lieutenant governor, Janice McGeachin. McGeachin is running for governor of the state and building a coalition including white nationalist and far-right militia backing, in what she tells her supporters is “the fight of our lives”. Last month at the America First Political Action Conference, a white nationalist conference, McGeachin praised attendees: “Keep up the good work fighting for our country,” she said in a pre-taped address. “I need fighters all over this country that are willing stand up and fight,” McGeachin continued, urging attendees to push out moderates in the Republican party. “Even when that means fighting amongst our own ranks because there are too many Republicans who do not exhibit the courage that is needed today for us to fight and protect our freedoms and our liberties. We are literally in the fight for our lives.” Three years after attending the the deadly “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, the far-right provocateur Nick Fuentes created the white nationalist conference AFPAC in the hopes of branding it a far-right alternative to the more mainstream conservative gathering CPAC. Fuentes is a well-known white nationalist and notorious antisemite who mocks how Jews were murdered in the Holocaust while also denying the Holocaust occurred. McGeachin has a history of giving speeches and mingling at far-right rallies, often riding the wave of the latest rightwing outrage. Last year at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, McGeachin gave a rousing speech at a mask-burning event on the Idaho capitol steps, where children burned masks in front of their parents. The Guardian reported last year on the growing civil war inside the Republican party in Idaho, when McGeachin imposed a ban on masks while the governor was out of state. McGeachin also created a taskforce to look into claims of “indoctrination” in schools in order to project children from “the scourge of Critical Race Theory, socialism, communism and Marxism” according to documents obtained by the Idaho Statesman newspaper. This month McGeachin also jumped on the cause of the trucker convoy protest, speaking at a locally planned convoy rally in Idaho. According to local TV station KTVB about 500 people showed up to protest against Covid-19 mandates, though Idaho has none. McGeachin told the crowd “Sometimes they refer to us as being ‘extreme’ for our views,” before reading out loud a quote from Barry Goldwater defending extremism in pursuit of liberty. “We are a free nation and it is so important that we stand now and continue to fight for that freedom and that liberty that makes this country so great,” she said. McGeachin has also attended a gathering where she was endorsed by a rightwing militia figure whom she had apparently made political promises too. In a video previously obtained by the Guardian Eric Parker – who was charged over his role in the standoff in 2014 at Bundy Ranch in Nevada where he was pictured pointing an assault rifle at federal agents – reminded McGeachin that she once told “if I get in, you’re going to have a friend in the governor’s office”. Experts who follow the far right in the US believe McGeachin represents a serious threat, especially as more militia-affiliated groups have started to enter local government in the US, such as in California’s Shasta county. “From her recent speech at AFPAC, continued embrace of white nationalism and endorsements from prominent antisemitic leaders to her longstanding ties with paramilitaries, it couldn’t be clearer that McGeachin is a danger to the rule of law, Idaho communities and democratic institutions,” said Amy Herzfeld-Copple, deputy director of programs at Western States Strategies, a non-profit that works for inclusive democracy through nonpartisan education and advocacy. A total of 31 faith leaders in Idaho recently signed an open letter calling for McGeachin to resign. Rabbis, reverends, pastors and others of different faiths across the state warned in the letter of the “staggering consequences of ignoring extremism” and describe a “rising tide of antisemitism here in Idaho”. The letter cited recent acts of vandalism including at the Anne Frank Human Rights Memorial in Boise. It said: “By associating with alt-right actors and groups like AFPAC in addition to your ties to militia groups that advocate for political violence and harassment in Idaho, you have proven you are not fit to hold elected office, let alone serve a heartbeat away from becoming Idaho’s next governor.” Rabbi Dan Fink of Ahavath Beth Israel in Boise, who co-signed the letter, said in an interview with KTVB that he was courted by McGeachin earlier this year, to help with a campaign against antisemitism. “The dissonance was so extraordinary. I both hurt and at some level, had to laugh because it was surreal,” Fink said in the interview, appalled that McGeachin would share a stage with a Holocaust denier while trying to enlist a rabbi’s help. “That you have the chutzpah to reach out to me and say ‘help me on antisemitism’ while going out and glorying in the presence of antisemites is extraordinary,” Fink said. Herzfeld-Copple said it was not clear how deep McGeachin’s popular support was in Idaho. “McGeachin is a troubling anti-democracy figure in our region seeking to build a national profile with violent and bigoted social movements that increasingly see her as their access to power. But we know these extremists are a minority and Idahoans have routinely rejected those who court white nationalists,” said Herzfeld-Copple. But far-right controversy is never far away from McGeachin and this week she took the highly unusual step of intervening on behalf of a far-right group in a child welfare case involving a 10-month old baby who is the grandson of a campaign consultant for the militia leader Ammon Bundy, founder of the far-right group People’s Rights. The child had been taken away from the parents after officials determined the child was “suffering from severe malnourishment” and in imminent danger. But the Idaho Statesman obtained text messages between McGeachin and Governor Brad Little showing McGeachin seeking to intervene in the case. “Is this true? Call off this medical tyranny tell the hospital to release the baby to his parents,” she wrote. Bundy himself was subsequently arrested this week for trespassing at St Luke’s hospital, where he went to protest with scores of supporters over what he called a “medical kidnapping”. “Nearly every day, McGeachin’s actions become more dangerous. She contradicted pleas from law enforcement and hospital officials and used her government Facebook page to discuss a confidential child welfare case, contributing to a mob of Ammon Bundy supporters that caused a lockdown at Idaho’s largest hospital, compromising delivery of patient and emergency care,” said Herzfeld-Copple. Experts who monitor the far right note that while there is a growing number of far-right legislators at the state and federal level, such as the Arizona state sentator Wendy Rogers, who has admitted to being a member of the Oath Keepers militia, or the Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who spoke at the same white nationalist conference as McGeachin amid chants of support for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. If McGeachin were to win the race and become governor in Idaho it would be a major victory for far-right politics in America. “There are a lot of implications for having someone in the executive branch giving the stamp of approval to far-right paramilitary groups and white nationalists,” said Devin Burghart, executive director of Institute for Research & Education on Human Rights. “In recent years it is unprecedented to see a lieutenant governor doing things like participating in a white nationalist conference or weighing in on a far-right-driven child endangerment issue, we haven’t seen that high a level of support for the far right since the days of the Council of Conservative Citizens, the lineal descendants of the White Citizens Council in the south.” said Burghart. Burghart warned that state politics and far-right extremism in the sparsely populated west of the US is often forgotten in the national political conversation, but it can have major consequences. “What happens out here in the west becomes a model, a testing ground for far-right activism. And what happens out here in the west doesn’t stay in the west, it migrates around the country, said Burghart.",News/US news,Republican hopes to ride far-right rage into Idaho’s governor’s office,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/18/idaho-republican-janice-mcgeachin-far-right-running-for-governor

3/18/2022,"The only all-Black, all-female second world war battalion will be awarded the Congressional Gold Medal after Joe Biden signed a bipartisan bill on Monday to honor the women’s efforts. The 6888th central post directory battalion, also known as the “six triple eight” was the only group of African American women to serve overseas during second world war. Created in 1944, it included 824 enlisted Black women and 31 officers from the women’s army corps, the army service forces and the army air forces. Initially, only white women were admitted to the women’s army corps, which was created by President Franklin D Roosevelt in 1943. However, following a push from the first lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, and civil rights leader Dr Mary McLeod Bethune, Black women were eventually admitted. In Europe, the battalion sorted and routed mail for over 4 million American service members and civilians. In addition to serving as a role model to generations of Black women who joined the military afterwards, it was also credited with solving a growing mail crisis due to a shortage of postal officers. Before their arrival in England, warehouses in Birmingham were filled with millions of undelivered letters and packages. When the women arrived in February 1945, they worked around the clock to maintain 7m information cards that included serial numbers to distinguish different people with the same last names. In the midst of rats nibbling on packages filled with cookies and cakes, the women investigated mail with insufficient address details to identify the intended recipient. They also returned mail addressed to service members who had died. Because the warehouse windows were blacked out to prevent light from showing during nighttime air raids, the women often had to sift through the mail in dimly lit environments, with their units organized into three separate eight-hour shifts. During winters, the women wore long johns and extra layers of clothing beneath their coats in the unheated warehouses. The battalion eventually created a new mail tracking system and processed 65,000 pieces of mail per shift. Within three months, the women cleared the six-month backlog of 17m pieces of mail. Despite their efforts, the women faced racist and sexist treatment, including “hostility and rumors impugning their character spread by both white and Black male soldiers who resented the fact that Black women were allowed in the army”, according to the US Army Center of Military History. At one point, a general criticized the unit commander, Maj Charity Adams, and threatened to give her command to a white officer. “Over my dead body, sir,” Adams reportedly responded. Out of the 850 members in the unit, only six are still alive. “We helped each other. We worked with each other,” retired Maj Fanny Griffin McClendon, who served as a battalion supervisor, told ABC News. McClendon, who is now 101 years old, was taken by surprise when she learned that her battalion was going to be honored. “It never occurred to me that we would even be considered for a medal of any kind,” she said. In a statement by Wisconsin representative Gwen Moore, who sponsored the bill after a daughter of 6888th member Anna Mae Robertson contacted her, she praised the battalion’s exploits during the war. “Facing both racism and sexism in a warzone, these women sorted millions of pieces of mail, closing massive mail backlogs, and ensuring service members received letters from their loved ones. A Congressional Gold Medal is only fitting for these veterans who received little recognition for their service after returning home,” Moore said. The Nevada senator Jacky Rosen, a member of the Senate armed services committee, introduced the Six Triple Eight Congressional Gold Medal Act with the Kansas senator Jerry Moran and applauded Biden for signing it into law. “They deserve our nation’s highest honors for their service. There is no better time to give them this long-overdue recognition than during Women’s History Month, and I’m proud to see President Biden sign our bipartisan legislation into law,” Rosen said. Brenda Partridge-Brown, the daughter of battalion member Willie Bell Irvin, told ABC News that the women were never properly honored. “It just means the world to me to know that my mother’s service was not in vain,” she said.

3/18/2022,"Ihave been shopping at my local farmers’ market for a decade. It does not stock ingredients from around the world such as lemons, limes or avocados but you can find a wide range of locally grown produce from apples and squashes, to leaves and herbs, to affordable cuts of meat and sustainable species of seafood like herring, mussels and crab. The ingredients are grown locally, so they are also locked into the seasons: strawberries are only available in summer, asparagus in May and June, courgette flowers, squashes, brassicas and game from late summer through to autumn. I know by name the people who grow the food that we eat and there is something empowering about buying directly from them. Not everyone in the UK has a local food market – and not everyone can afford to shop at one – but something happened over the last two years that made people begin to appreciate different ways of shopping. The speed with which the supermarket shelves emptied at the start of lockdown highlighted just how insecure our food systems are: it was often easier to find locally produced food in markets and farm shops, delis and online, than in supermarkets. As the panic-buying phenomenon unfolded, producers and farmers could communicate stock availability directly to the consumer through social media channels and establish themselves to a wider demographic. For the first time in decades, the industrialised system that had slowly separated us from the people who grew our food started to unravel and many of us realised that food shopping could be a different, altogether more pleasurable experience. On the flip side, Covid showed us starkly the causal link between inadequate nutrition, poor human health and our susceptibility to viruses and disease. Britain has the worst diet in Europe, with 52% of our shopping basket consisting of ultra-processed foods. The statistics accompanying Leon co-founder Henry Dimbleby’s National Food Strategy (2021) are also terrifying: diet-related illnesses in the UK have been linked to an estimated 90,000 premature deaths – higher than alcohol-related deaths and nearly as much as smoking. As obvious as it may sound, our food choices are a matter of life or death. The school closures during the pandemic also emphasised the huge inequality in our diets. For many children, school lunch is the one hot meal in their day. I saw this only too clearly when my restaurant, Wahaca, cooked meals for school hampers during that first lockdown, as part of the Chefs in Schools initiative. The charity is driven by a desire for children on every income to succeed at school – and in life – by being properly nourished by the food they eat. In the three years in which we have operated, we have demonstrated that better is possible – children can be well fed in an affordable way. Government bodies, such as the Department for Education, must get to grips with the fact that good food matters. Schools have food standards but they are not enforced. There is an archaic, blase attitude that food is a side issue in the business of living a healthy life. Before the pandemic began, I was already locked into the idea that every time I shopped I was making a political statement with my money. We eat three times a day, so three times a day our food choices dictate who, in our complex food system, benefits from our spending power. The pandemic taught us that better food is not a luxury, but a necessity. It keeps us alive, it keeps us well. Two years on, more than ever I feel that everyone needs access to better food, regardless of their background. We must pay our farmers properly and reward them for regenerating the soil and protecting biodiversity; taxing highly processed foods, which cost billions in healthcare, emit carbon, destroy our soil and kill our insects, could fund this. Food is delicious but it is also life – let’s start putting it at the heart of the conversation.

3/18/2022,"I just love pink rhubarb – and now that it’s in season and available from Ocado, you’ll find it works beautifully in this simple hazelnut frangipane tart, spiked with orange and ginger. My slightly left-field pastry technique is to line the pastry case as soon as the pastry is made, and then chill it afterwards – it’s so much easier to work with than fridge-cold pastry, and a quick stint in the freezer gives it the necessary resting time.

Add the egg and blitz again very, very briefly until the dough comes together into a rough ball. Don’t wash the food processor – you’ll use it again in a moment. On a well-floured surface, roll your pastry into a large circle, about 3mm thick. Carefully use your rolling pin to lift the pastry and line a 23-25cm tart tin with a removable base (25cm external diameter, not internal). Very gently pat the pastry into all the corners of the tin, use a sharp knife to trim the excess, and prick the base with a fork a few times. Transfer the pastry case to the freezer to chill for 15 minutes. Use any excess pastry to line smaller tart tins, or wrap and freeze for future use. (I prefer to make slightly more pastry than have too little to line the tart case.) Meanwhile, make your frangipane. Tip the roasted chopped hazelnuts and sugar into the food processor, and blitz until the hazelnuts are very fine, like ground almonds. Add in the butter, flour, ginger and eggs, and blitz again briefly until you have a thick paste. Scrape the frangipane into a container and refrigerate. Preheat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/400F/gas 6. Once the pastry has chilled for 15 minutes, line it with crumpled baking paper, and then tip in a tub of baking beads, or rice. Blind bake for 10 minutes before removing the baking paper and beads, and then bake for a further 5 minutes until the base of the pastry is just sandy to the touch. Let the tart case cool down while you prepare the rhubarb: cut the stalks into diagonal pieces of about an inch, then toss in a bowl with the sugar and orange zest. Once the case is cool, increase the oven temperature to 200C (180C fan)/425F/gas 7. Spread the chilled frangipane over the base of the pastry, and then arrange the sugared rhubarb in a pattern of your choice. Scatter over the remaining sugar and zest. Bake the tart for 30 minutes, until the frangipane has slightly risen – a skewer inserted should come out clean. Let the tart cool for 20 minutes before serving. You can make this ahead of time, storing it in the fridge until needed, and then gently reheat before serving.

3/18/2022,"Jacques Audiard’s freewheeling ensemble picture Paris, 13th District, or Les Olympiades, is a sexy film about sexiness. Sexiness is the glue that binds the film and provides the connective tissue between its disparate scenes and its cast of characters. The movie lives in the jittery longing of before-sex, the woozy residue of after-sex, the urgency of during-sex. People here have a lot of sex, and the older non-sex-having people (a dad, a grandma) are mostly absent, though the dad actually is having sex (off camera). But when the sex is withdrawn, it leaves behind a sadness and a resentment that the film leaves mostly unsaid. Les Olympiades is the name of the high-rise apartment blocks in the 13th arrondissement of Paris where the action is mostly located – and the film is shot in an unsentimental black-and-white that never makes the city look beautiful in any nouvelle vague style. It is adapted from some stories in the 2015 collection Killing and Dying by the American comic-book artist Adrian Tomine and transplanted from the US to France. It may be that Audiard’s film does not deliver quite the sweetness and empathy for which Tomine’s stories were admired, but there is tremendous fluency and visual charge in his film-making; he gets strongly engaged performances from his cast, and his storytelling has gusto. Audiard also unselfconsciously carries off that mysterious joined-up world effect of a character from one story showing up in another: the discreet sprinkling of happenstance and coincidence that occurs throughout the film. Lucie Zhang plays Émilie, a sharp-tongued young woman living rent-free in an apartment belonging to her grandma, who is now in a care home suffering from dementia. Émilie is looking for a flatmate to provide her with some unearned income, because she senses (correctly) she is about to be fired from her call-centre job for being rude to the customers. This is Camille (Makita Samba), a high-school teacher, who is about to quit his own job to work on his doctoral thesis. They have sex – he is hugely turned on by the Saran wrap she has put around her stomach to lose weight – but he hurts her feelings by airily declaring he wants not to be a couple with her, merely a roommate-with-benefits. Camille’s own destiny is to link with that of Nora (Noémie Merlant), a thirtysomething woman who has come to Paris to avoid a toxically coercive relationship in her home town and enrol as a mature student. But when she wears a peroxide wig to a party, Nora is mistaken for “Amber Sweet” (Jehnny Beth), an online sex-chat worker; and, after being noisomely bullied, Nora turns to Amber Sweet herself for help, and their relationship begins to flower. Relationships and how we treat people are the keynote themes – and maybe my favourite moment comes when Camille makes a family visit to see his recently widowed father (Pol White) and his 16-year-old sister Eponine (Camille Léon-Fucien) who tells him she now intends to be a standup comic and what does he think? Camille instantly delivers a fantastically supercilious monologue about how he despises comedy. Poor Eponine tearfully storms off to her bedroom; Camille haughtily shrugs and with an air of fearless integrity says that she asked for his opinion. His dad is incredulous: “No one gives a fuck what you think!” he rages, adding that all Camille had to do was show a little support. And it’s true. Opinions are changeable and negligible: the need to show tact, kindness and love is constant. I’m not sure that Les Olympiades says anything too profound about any of its cast of characters, but Audiard achieves something very watchable and entertaining in anthologising them. This is a connoisseur date movie.  Paris, 13th District screened at the Cannes film festival and is released on 18 March in the UK in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema.",Arts/Film,"Paris, 13th District review – Jacques Audiard’s sexy apartment-block anthology",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/14/paris-13th-district-review-jacques-audiards-sexy-apartment-block-anthology
3/18/2022,"Sydney MP Alex Greenwich says he will seek to ban gay conversion practices and remove a swathe of laws that discriminate against LGBTQ+ people in New South Wales in a bill, to help determine who he’d support if next year’s election results in a hung parliament. The announcement has been welcomed by advocate group Equality Australia, with chief executive Anna Brown calling for multiparty support for the legislation. Greenwich, an independent, said on Friday that he would begin consultation on an omnibus “equality” bill that would seek to unwind a series of discriminatory laws against LGBTQ+ people ahead of next year’s global WorldPride event in Sydney. The bill to be presented in draft form later this year, before being voted on after the next election, would remove wide-ranging exemptions in the state’s 45-year-old anti-discrimination act that allow private schools to discriminate against gay or trans students and teachers. The bill would also allow trans people to change their sex or gender on legal documents without undergoing surgery, while also ending the “unnecessary medical procedures” carried out on intersex people without their consent. Significantly, the bill would also seek to ban gay conversion practices, a move which would bring the state into line with other jurisdictions such as Victoria, which recently passed similar legislation. On Friday, Greenwich said he was flagging his intention to introduce the bill to put both the government and Labor on notice that, in the case of a hung parliament, the bill could play a deciding factor in who he throws his support behind. “I’m making it clear early on to the major parties that how they approach this bill will be a key factor in who I will decide to support in a [minority] government situation in the next election,” he said. While some parts of the reform would be straightforward – removing discrimination exemptions for gay teachers and students would only require an amendment of the existing act – Greenwich said a ban on conversion practices would be more complex because NSW does not have a human rights act similar to the one used to ban the practice in Victoria. For that reason, he said, he was starting a wide-ranging consultation process before seeking to present a draft of the bill later this year. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Advocates have long argued that NSW’s anti-discrimination act, which was seen as a landmark change when it passed in 1977, is long overdue for reform. Last year, the Public Interest Advocacy Centre released a report arguing the bill offered protection to “a narrow range of groups”, had “outdated tests for what constitutes discrimination” and contained “excessively broad exceptions allowing discrimination by organisations like private educational authorities”. “The act is long, complex and idiosyncratic,” the report stated. Brown said Equality Australia wanted to see strong support from political parties for the bill. “In NSW, our communities are still subjected to so-called conversion ‘therapy’, trans people still face cruel and unnecessary barriers to accessing accurate identity documents, doctors are still performing unnecessary medical procedures on intersex people without their consent, and private schools and religious organisations are still able to sack, expel or deny service to LGBTQ+ people,” Brown said. “Reforms like this can only succeed with multi-partisan support. We call on the NSW government and opposition to work with LGBTIQ+ people to progress full equality for our communities.” While Greenwich and two other independents currently have an informal agreement with the Coalition government not to block supply, they have never entered into any formal deal. Greenwich has previously navigated abortion decriminalisation laws through the NSW parliament in 2019, and his voluntary assisted dying bill passed through the lower house at the end of 2021. It is due to be debated the state’s upper house next week.",News/Australia news,Bill to ban gay conversion and reform discrimination laws could help decide next NSW government: MP,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/18/bill-to-ban-gay-conversion-and-reform-discrimination-laws-could-help-decide-next-nsw-government-mp
