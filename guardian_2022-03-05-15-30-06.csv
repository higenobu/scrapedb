3/5/2022,"There is more than one struggle. There is the war of bombs, the war that’s taking lives. And then there’s the battle over what can be done. It’s Saturday 26 February, less than 72 hours after Russia invaded Ukraine, and I’m standing in New York City’s Times Square. Like other squares, boulevards, and city streets, it has been taken over by blue and gold. One by one, Ukrainians, Kazakhs, Belarusians, and even Russians step up to the megaphone to explain why they are here. “I encourage you to support the armed forces informationally and financially,” one of the speakers tells the crowd. “Share the right information to the right people at the right time. This is as much as we can do and I think that’s even more powerful coming from here.” “We are hashtagging Stand With Ukraine, but what are we doing?” pleads a woman in a flower crown, surrounded by children. “Action, action is what matters. Call your elected leaders. Demand more support for Ukraine.” We are 5,000 miles away from our land. As mortar shells and cruise missiles bombard our home, we are safe. As over a million refugees flee into the rest of Europe, we are safe. Safe, but not silent. We know that words and actions are our weapons. In the face of the Russian president questioning whether Ukrainians as a people exist, the best answer is a resounding, global echo: we exist. The crowd, a couple hundred people, clutch their phones as they chant “glory to Ukraine” and sing the national anthem. On my own phone, a constant stream of Telegram notifications: “‼УВАГА! У Києві оголошена повітряна тривога!” – “ATTENTION! Air raid sirens in Kyiv!” I take a video to send to my family. The first message is to loved ones under siege in the capital. “The world is with you,” I tell them. Next I text a family member in Canada. He responds with a video, too. “Fights near the house where you grew up,” he writes. “Right now.” I grew up in Kyiv, at a time when the newly independent Ukraine was restructuring itself and life was difficult. I moved to Canada at 11, but I was never fully untethered. Until the pandemic, I made a trip back every year, sometimes spending entire summers there. I grew up to become a journalist, and for the last five years or so, I’ve been reporting on what’s real on the internet and what isn’t. It’s personal now. Citizen diplomacy for Ukraine’s freedom is moving mountains. As Putin’s blitzkriegs bomb military and civilian targets alike, Ukrainians and their allies have zeroed in on a list of demands for politicians that boil down to this: isolate Russia, shield Ukraine. These demands are listed in hashtag campaigns, in tweets and TikToks, on Stories, in Facebook groups. They’re shouted in the streets and formally requested in letters. They’re discussed in group chats. Economic sanctions that were previously unimaginable are now politically necessary. Since Russia’s recognition of occupied Ukrainian territories as so-called independent republics on 22 February, 977 sanctions have been imposed. And counting. Countries including Germany and Switzerland are breaking with long political traditions to stand with Ukraine. Their citizens continue demanding even more. As do the citizens of other countries Putin trampled over. “Our country is sending troops to fight with Russia against Ukraine, and I don’t support that either,” says a young woman who declines to give her name because her parents are in Belarus. Since brutally quelling the 2020 protests around the presidential election, the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, has moved even closer to Vladimir Putin. The two countries have continuously held joint military exercises ever since. Belarus is now Putin’s launchpad. Downtown at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village, queer Ukranian activists are holding a rally of their own. “I’m from Kazakhstan, and Kazakhstan is fighting a very similar fight right now,” says Dina, another young woman who declines to give her full name. Like me, she rushed here from Times Square. In January, Putin sent 2,500 troops to Kazakhstan, where they shot live rounds at protesters. “Putin is dangerous,” Dina says. “The more we talk about it, the better.” Through his inhumane actions, Putin has built a coalition of very angry people. At the Stonewall Inn – site of a riot that launched the gay liberation movement in the US – queer activists recall the torture and killings in Chechnya’s “gay purge”, climate activists call out Russia’s oil industry, Americans speak of democracy, Jews scoff at Putin’s rhetoric about “denazification”. Each of them is a node, mobilizing their networks online and off, branching out into more angry people making more demands. Things are moving fast; the communication is interconnected. I see a woman holding a QR code for a sign and scan it, perhaps unwisely, with my continuously buzzing phone. The page loads and I’m looking at a resource document I know well. It was put together by a person in Kharkiv, a city now brutally bombed. On the first day of the invasion, on a Twitter Spaces channel populated by thousands, someone had said, “We need to organize donation resources in one place.” Someone else had said, “An English translation would be nice.” A couple DMs later I was helping write a brief introduction for the very list that the woman at the Stonewall protest is promoting with her QR code. I snap a photo and send it to the original activist in Kharkiv, a city under brutal bombardment. “Nice,” they respond. A transatlantic flow of information. I try to speak to the woman with the sign but the protest organizer comes around and she puts him in front of my recorder instead. The organizer is Bogdan Globa, founder of LGBTQ Ukrainians in America. His mom is in Kyiv, he says after a deep breath. I tell him I have family in Kyiv, too. Ukraine’s LGBTQ+ people face even more danger from Russia than non-queer Ukrainians because of Putin’s draconian anti-gay laws, he says. The rally is a way to show them that they have support even thousands of miles away. “The first day was a shock. But now I see the power of the people rises, more and more people are involved.” He talks about his mom with a shaking voice. “Today is the first day I put myself together. I did not expect I would be so broken. Yesterday the last message from my mom was, ‘Russian tanks are there.’ And then she disappeared for 10 hours. And I didn’t know what to think.” They’ve re-established contact, he tells me. She’s OK. In the face of Russian disinformation and attacks, telling our stories, the stories of our families and our people, telling them honestly and clearly, has become one of our best weapons. Putin wanted this war to be held in muddied waters. Before the full-scale invasion, his delusional speech tried to rewrite Ukrainian history. It’s easy to see how this could have been a tempting narrative for the world to indulge in. The world, after all, stood by when Crimea was annexed, and when the Ukrainian east was occupied. Perhaps they saw it through the lens of “regional complexities”. But no amount of “denazification” narratives or false claims of “genocide” against Russians could stand up to the truth: he is bombing innocent people. In the basement of a church in Manhattan, volunteers for Razom have come straight from a protest to an organizing meeting. It’s mostly women in sight as they talk to volunteers and offer Ukrainian food to visitors. Razom – translated as “together” – is a product of the 2014 revolution. They’ve helped veterans, trained doctors, and organized cultural exchanges. Now, Razom has been elevated to global fame as good people seek out places to support. Already they’ve raised nearly $1m for humanitarian aid. And they know exactly what needs to be done. The leaders present a PowerPoint about the expected phases of the war, including the increasingly desperate refugee crisis. They talk through logistics, humanitarian aid corridors, and letter-writing campaigns. “This is going to be a marathon, not a sprint,” says Mariya Soroka, one of the organizers. But first, the room watches the Ukrainian choir perform the cold open for Saturday Night Live. Like many others, I try not to cry. “To say that the past five days have changed my life is to say nothing,” Soroka says. Everyone in the room nods. I nod with them. The scale of the loss is settling in. All of us, all of us are losing something. Instead of how are yous, people here greet each other with facts. Here’s who I have in Ukraine. Here’s what city they are in. Here are the losses of the latest blitzkrieg against my city. Among the volunteers is Luke Tomycz, Soroka’s husband and a neurosurgeon who has been training doctors in Ukraine for the last five years through a project called Co-Pilot. He tells me that a Syrian doctor reached out to him to say, “We feel a kinship to Ukrainians because we feel like we have experienced what they’re going through.” Russia has bombed hospitals in Syria, worsening the refugee crisis then as it is now. Doctors in the Ukrainian Medical Association of North America are helping with advocacy and medical logistics, including the urgent delivery of specialized medications that need refrigeration. The volunteers split into working groups, and Razom broadcasts it on Instagram live. Their list of resources has gone viral, like so many other lists of resources. In all directions, at every opportunity, citizen diplomacy presses politicians to act, forces people on to the streets, urges them to give money and attention. I stop Maryna Prykhodko mid-Instagram post. She’s in charge of communication around here and she tells me the next target. Sanctions have been implemented. Russia has been cut off from the Swift banking system. Now, Razom wants protection for the Ukrainian sky. Putin’s action and his nuclear threats “should outrage the entire world”, she says. “You cannot stop asking politicians for more support for Ukraine and more sanctions against Russia,” she says. “This is like our mantra. We have to say it out loud.”",News/World news,Ukrainians around the world aren’t just protesting - we’re fighting an information war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/ukraine-protest-information-new-york

3/5/2022,"Rishi Sunak is facing pressure to use his spring statement this month to launch an emergency support package in response to the war in Ukraine, with measures to boost humanitarian aid and help for UK households with soaring energy bills. Urging the chancellor to announce a comprehensive set of measures at the mini-budget due on 23 March, the heads of the TUC and Britain’s biggest trade unions said financial assistance was vital to cushion the impact from Russia’s invasion. In a letter to Sunak seen by the Guardian, the union leaders said a step-change in financial support was required for the people of Ukraine as well as for UK families struggling with a cost of living crisis as the conflict drives up energy prices. The wholesale cost of gas broke records on Friday, with the UK benchmark rising to 480p per therm, while petrol hit a new high at the pump of 153p per litre. Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said: “Working people in the UK will need protection from even steeper hikes in gas bills from the conflict. The chancellor should introduce grants to help with energy prices, roll out an emergency programme of home insulation, and fund it with a windfall tax on excess energy profits.” The intervention comes as analysts warn the conflict in Ukraine could add to the highest rates of inflation for three decades, should a sustained rise in oil and gas prices feed through to household bills. Poverty campaigners have called on the government to increase the value of universal credit benefits by more than the 3.1% planned for April to prevent a sharp increase in hardship, alongside demands to overhaul the package of energy support announced last month. Inflation reached 5.5% in January, the highest level since the early 1990s, while economists have warned the rate of increase for the cost of living could hit 8% this year after Vladimir Putin ordered troops into Ukraine, sparking an energy crisis. The independent Joseph Rowntree Foundation estimates the planned real-terms cut to benefits in April could pull 400,000 people into poverty, at a time when the UK’s main out-of-work support is already at a 30-year low after a decade of cuts and less than six months on from the £20 a week cut to universal credit. In their letter to the chancellor, the union bosses from the TUC, Unite, Unison, GMB, teachers’ unions and other leading groups said more needed to be done to protect working families from further energy price rises as a result of the crisis. It said more generous grants could be offered instead of a £200 repayable loan, universal credit could be increased by more than is planned, while the value of the warm homes discount for the poorest families could be increased and more funds made available to people wanting to insulate their properties. Against a backdrop of surging energy prices, the unions said a new 100% tax on “additional profits” made by UK based companies from their shareholdings in Russian state-backed enterprises that have profited from the gas price crisis could be launched to help fund its recommended measures. It said this would include profits made by firms like Shell and Vitol from their shareholdings in oil and gas fields in Russia in joint ventures with Kremlin-backed companies Rosneft and Gazprom. Several western energy giants, including Shell and BP, have announced plans to divest multibillion-pound stakes in Russian projects since the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine. Urging the government to pursue all diplomatic efforts towards peace, the trade union leaders said safe routes to the UK were needed for those fleeing conflict and that changes to government legislation that would close the door on people fleeing war and threats to their lives needed to be scrapped. They said funding for humanitarian assistance for displaced people, including essential medical supplies, were also vital. A government spokesperson said: “We recognise the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, and are providing support worth around £20bn this financial year and next to help. “This includes a £200 reduction on bills this autumn and a £150 non-repayable reduction in council tax bills, on top of the existing £12bn of support we have in place already. The energy price cap also continues to insulate millions of customers from volatile global gas prices. “We are also putting an average of £1,000 more per year into the pockets of working families via changes to universal credit and boosting the minimum wage by more than £1,000 a year for full-time workers.”",News/Politics,Unions urge Sunak to address Ukraine and cost of living in spring statement,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/05/unions-urge-sunak-to-address-ukraine-and-cost-of-living-in-spring-statement
3/5/2022,"My wife and I are setting off on a weekend away; she’s driving. After about 20 minutes conversation flags, and I take my phone out of my pocket. “Ow,” I say, examining my fingers. “What’s happened?” my wife says. “An attack of hot hand,” I say. “Hot hand?” she says. “The fingers of this hand get hot for no reason,” I say. “Actually just the thumb and forefinger.” “Hot all the time?” she says. “They’re not hot themselves,” I say. “They just make things I touch feel hot. Like my phone.” “Maybe your phone is hot,” she says. “Don’t you think I might have considered that?” I say. Actually I thought my phone was the problem for a week. “You’ve never mentioned this,” my wife says. “I’ve kept it from you,” I say. “Why don’t you make an appointment?” she says. “I’m not telling a doctor that two of my fingers make things seem hot sometimes.” “Not so long ago you were complaining about your hand being cold,” she says. She is wrong about this: it’s actually more than a decade since I suffered from cold mouse hand: whenever I worked at my computer for long periods, the hand using the mouse became unbearably cold. I found some fellow sufferers online, but it didn’t seem like a club I wanted to belong to. When we are with friends later, my wife tells everyone about my hot hand. I should have remembered how little she is to be trusted with the details of a medical issue she finds amusing. “It’s true,” she tells them. “He complained the whole way up.” “What, your fingers feel hot?” asks one friend. “No, they make the things I touch feel hot,” I say. “Have you looked it up?” asks another friend. “I don’t want to know what it is,” I say. Our friend types my symptoms into her iPad, and shows me the results. I recognise some of the ailments from my cold mouse hand days: De Quervain’s syndrome, Raynaud’s … “You should get it checked,” she says. “It’s not even on my top 10 list of things wrong with me,” I say. Back home on Sunday, I am decanting clothes into the washing machine when I hear a loud chirp. “Have you fed the cat?” my wife says. “No, I was just …” I stop at a second chirp. “What’s wrong with you?” she says. “Is that the smoke alarm?” I say. “Is what the smoke alarm?” she says. “That noise,” I say. “Have you gone mad?” she says. The chirps could be warning that the alarm’s back-up battery is dead, except I changed the battery recently. While I am staring up at the smoke alarm the chirp sounds again, from some distance away. I think: upstairs. I pull the upstairs alarm off the ceiling. It is suspiciously hot to the touch, until I switch hands. I hear the chirp again. Downstairs, I stand under the first alarm, until it chirps. I go into the living room, where my wife and the middle one are watching TV, holding the upstairs alarm in front of me like Yorick’s skull. “I can’t tell which alarm needs a new battery.” “Which one was going off?” says the middle one. “They both were, I think,” I say. I hear the chirp again, directly above my head. “And now this one,” I say, looking up. But the ceiling is blank: there is no alarm in this room. I step into the hall and hear the chirp again, this time seemingly from upstairs. I go back to the living room. “I don’t understand,” I say. “What’s wrong with you?” says the middle one. The chirp goes off again, nearby. “Where is that coming from?” I scream. “From the one in your hand!” he shouts. “But it’s not connected to anything!” I yell. I walk across the room and bury the alarm under a sofa cushion. Then I stand by the door with my arms folded. After a long and awkward silence, there is a muffed chirp from beneath the cushion. “I knew he was going mad,” my wife says. “I think I might have a battery in my office,” I say. When I go off to look I decide not to come back for a little while.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Tim Dowling: my hand is hot, I’m hearing things – and my wife says I’m going mad",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/05/tim-dowling-my-hand-is-hot-im-hearing-things-and-my-wife-says-im-going-mad
3/5/2022,"US regulators have accused Weight Watchers of using a diet app to illegally gather information on children as young as eight years old, including their names, email addresses and birth dates, without their parents’ consent. A complaint, filed on Friday by the justice department on behalf of the Federal Trade Commission, said that Weight Watchers and its subsidiary Kurbo – a kids’ weight management platform – violated the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, which requires parental consent for the collection or use of any personal information of users under the age of 13 years old. In 2018, Weight Watchers – which rebranded as WW – acquired Kurbo Health, a technology startup, and went on to launch Kurbo by WW. The release of the app was met with criticism, as it was designed to target kids and teenagers between eight and 17 years old. Medical professionals and parents argued that it was “irresponsible” of Weight Watchers to release the app and said it could encourage children to develop “life altering eating disorders that will eventually kill some of them”. The FTC alleged that the app’s signup process encouraged younger users to falsely claim that they were above 13 years old, despite text that indicated to children below 13 that they needed to sign up with a parent. The registration interface indicated two options: “I am a parent. I’ll sign myself up first so I can support my child on the Kurbo program” and “I am at least 13 and using the app for myself, without parental supervision.” The complaint said, “While theoretically intended to screen users under 14 from registering without the assistance of a parent, this non-neutral age signaled to children that they could register without involving a parent by indicating they were at least 13 years old.” “In fact, from 2014 to 2019, hundreds of users who signed up for the app claiming to be over the age of 13 later changed their birthdates on their profiles to indicate they were really under 13,” the FTC said. Although the signup option for children over 13 years old was revised in 2020, the FTC allege that Kurbo nonetheless “failed to provide a mechanism to ensure that those who choose the parent signup option were indeed parents and not a child trying to bypass the age restriction”. The FTC also accused Weight Watchers and Kurbo of retaining children’s personal information indefinitely and “only deleting it when requested by a parent”. In a statement to CBS, Michael Colosi, general counsel at Kurbo, pushed back against the allegations. “At no time did Kurbo ever target children with advertising, sell data to third parties or otherwise monetize its users in any way, and no parents or children ever complained that Kurbo used their personal data in an inappropriate manner,” he said. On Thursday, a federal judge in California approved a settlement order that requires Weight Watchers and Kurbo to pay a $1.5m penalty, delete sensitive health data and destroy any algorithms derived from the data. “Our order against these companies requires them to delete their ill-gotten data, destroy any algorithms derived from it and pay a penalty for their lawbreaking,” said Lina Khan, the FTC chair, in a statement. According to Colosi, the $1.5m settlement is merely a reflection of “Kurbo’s desire to focus on its business and its mission of continuing to help families and children in a safe and protected environment”.",News/Society,"Weight Watchers allegedly used diet app to illegally gather data on children, FTC says",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/04/weight-watchers-kurbo-diet-app-children-data

3/5/2022,"Chips come in seriously large portion sizes that can lead to waste. In research done by the Sustainable Restaurant Association and Just Eat, 25% of consumers said that, when they ordered a takeaway, more than half the time they had leftovers that would end up wasted. The most common reason for this was unintentionally ordering larger portions than was needed (43%), with chips being one of the most wasted foods. To use up your excess chips, reheat them in a hot oven until piping hot right through and eat with your favourite condiment. Or make Canadian-style poutine by topping the reheated chips with curd cheese and gravy. They also make a great Spanish tortilla, saving the time needed to fry potatoes from scratch: simply refry the chips until hot right through, with or without caramelised onion, toss with beaten egg and cook on both sides. Our current household favourite brunch is hash, which is a great way to absorb any scraps that you have in your fridge, including both leftover meat and vegetables. It turns them into a miraculous, waste-saving, one-pot wonder. This is one to make the day after you’ve ordered too many chips. It’s particularly yummy becauze the chorizo oil coats the potatoes with its delicious, salty, umami flavour. However, if you prefer, use any other meat or purely just vegetable leftovers. I do recommend you finish the dish with a crispy fried egg or vegan equivalent, such as fried tofu. The trick with a good hash is to cook the ingredients until they start to caramelise and char, stirring only when it’s really necessary, so -you don’t end up with mashed potatoes. This recipe is infinitely adaptable, so be creative and use up what you have.

Add the leftover vegetables and cook for another three minutes. Roughly chop and add the cooked chips, smoked paprika and garlic.

3/5/2022,"Away from the lights and fountains of the Las Vegas Strip, bulldozers are working overtime as the suburbs of Sin City are bursting out of their seams. Las Vegas is growing at a staggering rate. Clark county, where the city is located, is home to roughly 2.3 million people, but forecasts predict the population could go beyond 4 million by 2055. Attracted by the lure of cheaper costs of living, lower taxes, and newly built homes, more than half a million people are expected to flock to southern Nevada in just the next 15 years. To accommodate them, the region’s arid landscape is being converted into strip malls and shopping centers as winding cul de sacs creep closer to the rocky hillsides. But balancing growth and climate change has posed a formidable challenge. Last year temperatures hit 116 degrees fahrenheit (46.6C) in June, setting a new record for such dangerously hot weather so early in the year. Concrete cooked during the day, spitting out heat long after the sun set. Thousands of unhoused residents, outdoor workers, and communities that couldn’t afford the rising costs of air conditioning bore the brunt. By July, 12 people lost their lives to the heat. In 2020, the Clark county coroner counted 124 heat-related deaths. It’s only going to get worse. The city is warming faster than anywhere else in the US. And the future will get hotter, drier and more turbulent, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a consortium of climate scientists from around the world, warned in its most recent report. The county is also grappling with a quickly waning water supply and intense air pollution that’s affecting the most vulnerable. The issues are exacerbated by heat, which will be driven higher by both the climate crisis and the building boom. Temperatures are going to keep climbing - and people are going to keep coming. Instead of curbing growth, the city known for excess is betting that it can conserve its way out of a climate catastrophe. Las Vegas leaders are making promises and setting ambitious sustainability goals. “We are one of the best-kept secrets in the world when it comes to sustainability”, said Jace Radke, a senior public information officer with the city of Las Vegas, listing off achievements. Already, the city has added 450 miles of bike lanes, switched 52,000 streetlights to LED lighting, and public buildings, parks, and traffic lights are powered by renewable energy, Radke said. Clark county, which adopted a new sustainability and climate action plan in 2021, aims to reduce emissions 100% by 2050. And, though water levels have drastically declined - and are expected to keep dropping - the region predominantly relies on recycling. Most indoor drains in Southern Nevada filter directly back into the reservoir. The sustainability work has had a positive impact, but there’s still a long way to go. In 2019, Clark county generated more greenhouse gas emissions than the city of Los Angeles - which is home to roughly 1.7 million more people - according to a new report issued by the county in February. Nearly half of the county’s emissions are from energy used to power buildings and industry. The next biggest share at 37% was attributed to transportation. Both of these sectors are slated to increase as more homes and businesses are built and rising numbers of residents hit the roads. The construction equipment itself is expected to add to emissions as the county continues to grow. Las Vegas ranks 12th in a list of the most polluted cities in the US for ozone, according to the American Lung Association. Residents - especially those in the hottest corners of the county - are already feeling the effects. In Cinthia Moore’s East Las Vegas home, two air purifiers hum throughout the day. Still, the single mom said, her son struggles with breathing problems and rashes when the air is at its worst. Since moving to the area, she has also gotten more migraines and allergy symptoms that won’t subside. The community, which has a 15% poverty-rate and where 25% of the population are immigrants, is far hotter than its neighbors, with fewer trees to ease punishing summer temperatures. The neighborhood’s older homes are less equipped to offer residents relief and renters, the majority of those who live there, are unable to add upgrades. Many residents can’t afford to run their air conditioning as energy bills and rising rents have consumed increasingly larger portions of their incomes, Moore said. Meanwhile, the slow churn of congestion on two major highways within a mile and a half of Moore’s home continues to spew pollutants. “There is a lot of traffic and cars are just sitting there,” she said. Commuters creep in and out of the city on the weekdays, and on Sundays scores of tourists idle in their cars in a crawling escape from Las Vegas. “There are folks who are living right there and it’s going into their homes and they are experiencing pollution every day.” If the air and the weather continue to worsen, she’s not sure how people will cope. “I always talk about leaving but it’s not that easy to just get up and move,” Moore said, noting the rising costs of living elsewhere. But more than that, she’d be leaving her support system, she said. “As a single mom it is hard. That’s why I stay here and fight for climate action.” Moore works as a real estate agent and has seen the housing crunch first-hand. But she is also coordinator for the Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition, a network of advocacy organizations pushing for sustainability. She and others have called on the county to more urgently address both pressing issues, which disproportionately impact people of color and the most vulnerable communities. **** ​​For Marci Henson, the director of Clark county’s department of environment & sustainability, a controversial land bill, which would open up tens of thousands of acres of pristine desert to developers, holds the key in balancing growth and a sustainable future. The federal legislation, pushed by the county and introduced in Congress last year, would authorize the sale of more than 36,100 acres of public land now operated by the Bureau of Land Management. Dotted with yuccas, arid landscape that stretches for miles south of Las Vegas along the I-15 corridor is being considered for a new suburb. The area is currently home to threatened desert tortoises but the bill would carve out new protected habitat for the imperiled species, part of roughly 2m acres elsewhere in the region that will be set aside as new conservation and recreation areas. It would also be a boon to local budgets. Funds from those land sales could funnel back to Clark county and be used to achieve its ambitious climate goals. They will need them. The proposed expansion is miles from the city and could add scores of new commuters. Dense concentrations of concrete over natural landscapes will drive up temperatures, and more air conditioners will fight to keep new buildings cool. But Henson said the county is prepared to address the issues. “We can’t say, ‘We are full, you can’t come here any more,’” said Henson. “We were challenged to find the balance between making more land accessible and providing a relief valve for that urban growth without undermining the quality of life and the resources here.” The biggest challenge, she said, may be water. The Colorado River Basin, which supplies 90% of the region’s water, is mired in the worst drought in recorded history. Nearby, Lake Mead now features an infamous and ominous bathtub ring showcasing the 150-foot drop in water levels over the last two decades. Facing declining supplies and an increasing consumer base, the region is working to tighten its belt. The Southern Nevada Water Authority’s track-record is strong - per capita water use in the region decreased roughly 47% between 2002 and 2020 - but progress has plateaued in recent years. Officials at the water agency say they have already taken care of the low-hanging fruit when it comes to conservation and are now stretching to get the harder-to-reach achievements. Because indoor use is almost entirely recycled, water waste is primarily attributed to older systems that cool large buildings like casinos and shopping malls, and to landscaping. Throughout the city, it’s easy to spot decorative grass lining parking lots or accenting the entrances to homes and businesses. The agency is working with the county and the business sector to prohibit thirsty cooling systems from being installed in new developments. They are also limiting what goes to golf courses which together with resorts claim 10% of the supply. Lawns that don’t have recreational use are being outlawed, with plans for full eradication by 2026. But rising heat will add new pressures on the system, driving demand up by an estimated 10 gallons per capita per day (GPCD). Usage is now at 110 GPCD but adding new homes and water-users will increase the burden. Though they are being crunched in both directions, the agency has set an ambitious goal to bring down consumption from a projected 123 GPCD, based on models that account for higher demand due to the rising heat, outdated systems, and expected growth, to 86 GPCD by 2035. The agency is also looking to new sources for supply. The SNWA abandoned a controversial plan for a 300-mile pipeline that would pump in groundwater from eastern Nevada in 2020, after decades of pushback from conservationists, tribes, and ranchers, but they still own water rights in the region. The department is also planning to help fund a water recycling project spearheaded by the Metropolitan Water District of southern California, which would grant them some of its output when construction is completed. Still, facing a drier future where water sources are scarce, conservation will be key. “Implementing conservation programs successfully are the things that allow me to sleep at night,” said Colby Pelligrino, the deputy general manager of water resources for the SNWA, adding that she isn’t concerned about continued sprawl. A Las Vegas native, she has watched the city grow and change, and sees the shifts as a hallmark of Southern Nevada. “When people think about Las Vegas they think about living in excess, but we have been a world-leader in water conservation for at least the last decade and a half,” she said. “We have got work to do to balance our water use and our water demands.” Patrick Donnelly, a tortoise biologist and the Great Basin Director for the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental advocacy organization, doesn’t see it that way. He has been fighting the lands bill since its inception and has grave concerns about unrestricted spread in southern Nevada. The lands bill has sharply divided environmental and justice advocates who disagree about the net effects of increasing both development and conservation areas. “The biggest issue with the Clark county lands bill is not the loss of tortoise habitat, it’s not even the water, it’s the climate crisis” Donnelly said, adding that it is “like hammering in the nails to our own coffin”. He doesn’t think the region can conserve enough to make up for a new sprawling suburb, more cars on the roads, and more concrete in one of the hottest areas in the country. “It is perpetuating the same pattern of unsustainable development that brought us to the brink of climate collapse to begin with.” Donnelly has been pushing lawmakers to plan for growing upward instead of outward. “There’s no doubt - Clark county does not have control over demographic shifts” he said. “But they are talking about Las Vegas metastasizing like a tumorous growth outside the valley. The idea that all those people need single-family residences to move into? That is wrong.” Ultimately though, people will continue to come and their future in the desert may be a precarious one. Those seeking more affordable options run the risk of getting stuck when the landscape becomes even less livable. “There’s a gallows humor when you live here, like, ‘Ha ha, one day this place is going to be uninhabitable,’” Donnelly said. “It is a dark joke but actually it is true. One day this place will be uninhabitable. And the question I pose when people say that is, ‘Who gets to leave?’” ",News/US news,"Record growth, record heat, record drought: how will Las Vegas weather the climate crisis?",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/04/las-vegas-population-growth-climate-crisis
3/5/2022,"Donald Trump was aware long before he took the stage at the “Save America” rally on 6 January that he would not march to the Capitol to protest the congressional certification of Joe Biden’s election win, according to his White House private schedule from that day. The former president started his nearly 75-minute long speech at the Ellipse by saying he would go with the crowd to the Capitol, and then repeated that promise when he said he would walk with them down Pennsylvania Avenue towards the Capitol. But Trump’s private schedule – released by the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack in a filing on Wednesday – shows Trump must have known that there were no plans for him to join such a march, and that he was being taken back to the White House. The newly-released private schedule indicates Trump deliberately lied to his supporters, raising the spectre that he made a promise he had no intention of honoring so that they would descend on the Capitol and disrupt Congress from certifying Biden as president. It is a significant revelation that could bolster the select committee’s claim in the filing that Trump engaged in a criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States by seeking to obstruct a lawful function of the government by deceitful or dishonest means. “Trump telling the crowd that he would join them at the Capitol was incendiary in that they thought that their field marshal would be there,” said Ryan Goodman, a former special counsel at the Department of Defense. “It is further evidence that Trump knew he was inciting an already highly volatile situation.” The former president’s private schedule may also support a parallel civil suit brought by the Democratic congressman Eric Swalwell, a former House impeachment manager, that Trump prompted the Capitol attack through his comments in his speech. “Trump directly incited the violence at the Capitol that followed and then watched approvingly as the building was overrun,” the lawsuit said. “The horrific events of January 6 were a direct and foreseeable consequence of the Defendants’ unlawful actions.” Trump’s private schedule for that day indicated the former president was to travel directly from the White House to the Ellipse, speak at the “Save America” rally there, and then immediately return to the White House once his speech had concluded. The former president was running late on 6 January, but the timestamp on the document reads 11.22am – roughly half an hour before he started to speak at the rally at 11.50am – meaning he must have known before he took to the stage that he was not going to the Capitol. Trump’s promises are significant as they served as one of the primary motivations for his supporters to march to the Capitol alongside militia groups like the Oath Keepers, and were used by far-right activists like Alex Jones to encourage the crowd along the route. Indeed, testimony in federal prosecutions of rioters charged in connection to the Capitol attack suggest Trump’s promises that he would walk with them to the Capitol was the proximate cause for them to also walk up to Congress before the march descended into a riot. An analysis of cellphone data published by the New York Times also reveals that many of Trump’s supporters who marched from the rally to the Capitol went down Pennsylvania Avenue as he had suggested, a more circuitous route than walking up the National Mall. Crucially, Trump made the false promises that led the crowd to go to the Capitol in spite of being told by the Secret Service days before the situation was too volatile for them to guarantee his security if he joined them, according to a source familiar with the matter. That raises the prospect that the former president encouraged his supporters to march on the Capitol, on a premise he knew to be false, in the hope that the security situation he had been told was volatile would lead to some event that would stop Biden’s certification. But regardless of what he agreed with the Secret Service, his private schedule from just before the speech indicates Trump deliberately and repeatedly lied to the crowd about his intentions in a way that could leave him vulnerable to criminal or civil charges. The former president’s private schedule came as part of court filings submitted by the select committee seeking to challenge former Trump lawyer John Eastman’s claim that thousands of emails demanded by the panel are protected by attorney-client privilege. The select committee said in its filing that it believed the privilege asserted over the records were not applicable because of the so-called crime-fraud exception, arguing Eastman was involved in potentially illegal efforts by Trump to overturn the 2020 election.",News/US news,Trump’s private schedule reveals no plans for him to join 6 January march,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/04/donald-trump-january-6-private-schedule-march-capitol-attack

3/5/2022,"The Afghan journalist Zahra Joya has been named as one of Time’s women of the year 2022 for her reporting of women’s lives in Afghanistan through her news agency, Rukhshana Media. Now living as a refugee in the UK, Joya continues to run the all-female Rukhshana Media from exile, publishing the reporting of her team of female journalists across Afghanistan on life for women under Taliban rule. Rukhshana Media partnered with the Guardian on the Women report Afghanistan series during the Taliban takeover in August 2021, which told the stories of women fleeing their homes as the Taliban advanced and the plight of divorced and single mothers, attacks on women police officers and the crushing of protests. Joya has continued to report for the Guardian since she was evacuated from Kabul to London. Joya launched Rukhshana Media in December 2020 with her own money as Afghanistan’s first feminist news agency, with the aim of becoming the first national news source where an Afghan woman in any region could see her own life reflected in the stories published every day. Both she and her journalists faced attacks and threats to their lives due to their reporting on women’s rights and her team in Afghanistan continues to work in secret. “Although it has never been easy to be a woman and a journalist in Afghanistan, now our reporting has been almost eradicated,” says Joya. “The Taliban have forced female journalists to wear the hijab, banning them from appearing on screen or in public, or from broadcasting their voices on radio in some provinces, but this makes it even more important that our stories continue to be told.” Joya was interviewed by Angelina Jolie for Time’s women of the year issue, which also featured the human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, the Olympian ​​Allyson Felix and the poet Amanda Gorman.",News/Global development,Afghan journalist Zahra Joya among Time’s women of the year,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/05/afghan-journalist-zahra-joya-among-times-women-of-the-year
3/5/2022,"How can Shane Warne be dead? That’s what they were saying all morning – on social media, group chats, in the hairdresser, the Saturday morning stretch classes – where we took our places, rolled out our mats and murmured to one another, “Oh my God, how about Warnie?” How about it? He was still very young at 52. But more than that – his death, at least in these fresh hours of the news, seems surreal. He can’t be dead because he was ridiculously, abundantly alive. Despite smoking, drinking and, at times in his career, not following the ideal diet – he exuded a vitality that is missing from even the most professionally trained, honed, healthy, mindset-coached and nutrient-enriched athlete. He just seemed to fizz with life. This life force found its way everywhere; he transcended cricket as easily as he played the game. There he was pashing Sharon Strzelecki in Kath and Kim. There he was in the British tabloids, caught in grainy photos in some long forgotten sex scandal. There he was in the glossy magazines, smooth of brow, filled of face, dating Liz Hurley, and seeming deliriously thrilled at his luck. There he was having a cheeky smoke in breach of his contract. There he was – entire mouth round a pot glass of beer, drinking with no hands (he needed hands to hold his ciggie). Even of late, there were no signs of a gentlemanly, subdued retirement to a private island or a country estate. He was Shane Warne – and he was going to keep amusing, annoying and appalling us forever. The shock is in part that Warne is mortal. Celebrities that populate the media landscape for decades, as Warne has done, can appear to exist in a different realm – one where they never die. To die is to end their story that we have been consuming for decades – but it also shakes us out of thinking that our story too will roll on without end. Speaking to a cricket-mad friend this afternoon, he said Warne’s death was his “Princess Diana moment”. He was drunk when he found out, on a dancefloor in Sydney when the news alert came through at 2am. “I guess I was like many cricket fans in their 30s and 40s. We were out dancing properly for the first time since lockdown lifted, and you get the news when you are a bit drunk and [the] sense of your mortality just hits you in the gut. It does feel a bit like the death of Diana. You remember where you were.” When the sun was up, the texts started flowing. “Warnie is dead!” “It’s not just my particular generation [who is upset],” said my 41 year-old friend. “My mum was really sad – she’s been texting me today. He had his flaws but we all loved him. We grew up with him – everything that they say about him he true, he was a genius, flawed, a strange funny man child … he revived an esoteric skill … no one bowled leg-spin. It was an uncool skill that looked like it was going to die out and he single handedly brought it back.” Warne, as many have said, was more than the sport he played. “It is not just the cricket – he was always in the news. He has this charisma and strange eloquence – it was very arresting,” continued my friend. And yes, he was always in the news – in his own words “in the front pages, the back pages and the middle pages” – always in the public eye. A place he put himself. He was a man of flaws but not so flawed he was unable to recognise them. In one of the many clips of interviews doing the rounds today, he said: “We are all human, we all have feelings, we all make mistakes. Some of us have made more than others. It doesn’t mean we are bad people. We are just trying to learn. “I’ve had some pretty tough times that I have to live with for the rest of my life through some poor choices. “Sure there’s a few things I’d like to change along the way – but you can’t so you’ve got to learn to live with them and confront them and try and learn by them.” In a way Warne’s untimely death is the end not just of an individual life but an entire era of a personality type – an older version of Australia that is now performed ironically in the inner city, if iat all. Warne was the sort of cheerful, beer-drinking, ciggie-smoking, pub-going, pie-eating larrikin that is rarely found in the ranks of professional sport these days. The PR machine couldn’t touch him – he was so authentically himself. In a week crowded with news – devastating and apocalyptic-seeming events (the floods, the war), Shane Warne’s unexpected death at 52 knocked so many of us for six. He will be terribly missed.

3/5/2022," By the church, a covey of partridges bustles about in the pasture, warming themselves in the golden sunshine. The morning air is tinged with the sweetness of manure, and from an adjacent field comes the hum of farm machinery. Gulls and corvids swarm above, rucking in the sky as a tractor churns the soil, exposing invertebrates to the baying crowd. Behind the ancient building stands a truly strange sight; an eerie gathering of long-dead oak trees. Squat, stocky trunks topped by a few remaining wizened branches. Despite the fact that even the day’s breeze cannot rouse any movement among their limbs, they appear to lurch and sway, seemingly animated, as though petrified while staggering across the landscape. Their abnormal appearance dominates, but how long they have stood is a mystery. Oaks have traditionally been seen as rulers of the woodland, representing strength and nobility, and it is thought that trees from this copse were once used to build the Royal Navy fleet, their wood grand enough for monarchy. Centuries later they are fragile and vulnerable. This area would once have been covered with trees, but an increase in agriculture means nature has had to make way for crops and livestock. Today, all that remains of the once-mighty woodlands are these few bizarre skeletons. Although dead, they’re brimming with life. Their flaking bark offers a refuge for invertebrates, their hollow trunks may have attracted fungi, mosses and lichens, and their remaining branches are perfect for woodpeckers, bats and nuthatches. Standing dead wood is a vital habitat that provides food and shelter for innumerable species, though is becoming increasingly rare thanks to our overzealous need to “tidy”. But while these oaks are protected by the current farmer, who has gone to rigorous measures to keep them safe, they cannot be guarded from the elements. Roughly once a year another is lost, felled by wind, rain or heat. In the field next door, the hum grows as the tractor draws nearer, ploughing the earth. Several birds have alighted in one of the tree’s branches, as though coronating it. These kings of the forest may have long lost their crowns, but they still manage to rule over this arable court.
