12/24/2021,"Scientists and environmental conservationists are opposing the development of the world’s first commercial octopus farm, arguing that it would torture an animal research has repeatedly proven to be sentient.

Driving the news: Spanish multinational firm Nueva Pescanova, which focuses on seafood commercialization and farming, succeeded in breeding the octopus in July 2019. According to their reports, the company will begin selling farmed octopuses in 2023.
 Nueva Pescanova plans to invest €50 million (approximately $57 million) in the octopus farm in the port of Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, according to PortSEurope. The plant is expected to produce 3,000 tons of octopus per year, which is equal to 10% of the annual catch of the Spanish fleet. The company is seeking a grant from the European Union’s Next Generation fund, an economic recovery package created to help member states bounce back from COVID-19 losses. In their request, Nueva Pescanova said their business will reduce pressure on wild stocks, an outcome in line with the United Nations’ direction on sustainable development. 
 

What critics are saying: Scientists and conservationists reportedly voiced opposition to the company’s plans. They argued that the octopus, as evidenced by hundreds of scientific studies, are sentient beings that feel pain and emotions humans likewise experience.
 An international group of researchers denounced Nueva Pescanova’s plans as “ethically and ecologically unjustified,” according to the BBC. Compassion in World Farming (CIWF), a U.K. based animal welfare campaign group, reached out to Spain and other governments, urging them to ban octopus farming. “These animals [octopuses] are amazing animals. They are solitary and very smart. So to put them in barren tanks with no cognitive stimulation, it's wrong for them,” Dr. Elena Lara, CIWF's research manager, told the BBC. She added that anyone who has seen Netflix’s Oscar-winning documentary “My Octopus Teacher” will appreciate such facts. Lara also slammed Nueva Pescanova’s wildlife argument as illogical, since their business does not guarantee that fishermen will cease fishing octopus. Still, the eight-armed cephalopod has little protection under the EU, whose animal welfare laws only apply to vertebrates. The U.K. amended its Animal Welfare Bill in late November to include the octopus, lobsters, crabs and related species as sentient beings. The update follows a review of more than 300 studies by the London School of Economics and Political Science. The consumption of octopus is legal in most countries, including many throughout Asia, where the animal is sometimes eaten alive. In 2019, a Chinese livestreamer went viral after an octopus latched onto her face in a final attempt to fight for its life. 
The first broodstock for the planned farm will reportedly arrive from the Pescanova Biomarine Center, Nueva Pescanova’s research and development facility in Galicia, Spain.

12/24/2021,"Procter & Gamble (P&G) has announced a new product recall after finding traces of benzene in some of its dry shampoo sprays and other spray products. This is in addition to the Secret deodorant and Old Spice recall from about a month ago, which includes several other products that might contain traces of benzene. If you have any of the Pantene, Aussie, Herbal Essences, Waterless, Old Spice, or Hair Food sprays in the recall list, you should stop using them immediately. Don't Miss: Wednesday’s deals: 100+ of Amazon’s craziest Black Friday deals are back Today's Top Deals The Best Deals Online Today (December 2021) Brand new AirPods Pro with MagSafe have a massive holiday discount you won't believe Price mistake alert: Amazon's $1 smart home device has a deeper discount than it's supposed to! The P&G products in the recall include aerosol dry conditioner spray and aerosol dry shampoo spray. The company detected the presence of benzene in some of the products from the brands listed above. P&G said in a press release that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) shared a few days ago that it conducted a review of its total portfolio of aerosol products. The action follows recent reports that said traces of benzene were present in some aerosol products. The company explained that benzene isn’t an ingredient in the products in the recall. But the review showed “unexpected levels of benzene” from the propellant that sprays the product out of the can. P&G detected benzene in several aerosol dry shampoo spray and aerosol dry conditioner spray products. 32 products from Pantene, Aussie, Herbal Essences, Waterless, Old Spice, and Hair Food are included in the recall. The company sold the conditioners and shampoo sprays listed in the recall nationwide. A complete list of conditioner and shampoo spray products that you should stop using is available on the FDA’s website. Benzene is a human carcinogen, and that’s why P&G issued the aerosol dry conditioner and dry shampoo recall. Exposure to benzene can occur via inhalation, orally, and through the skin. It can lead to cancers, including leukemia and blood cancer of the bone marrow, as well as blood disorders. These illnesses can be life-threatening. “Based on exposure modeling and the cancer risk assessments published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (IRIS database), daily exposure to benzene in the recalled products at the levels detected in our testing would not be expected to cause adverse health consequences,” the press release reads. Furthermore, P&G said that it had not received any reports of adverse events related to the conditioner and shampoo sprays in the recall. P&G advises buyers to stop using any of the conditioner and shampoo sprays in the recall. They should also dispose of the aerosol cans appropriately. Customers can also seek reimbursement for the products in the recall. The company says that the vast majority of its products are not part of the recall, “including mousses, hairsprays, liquid shampoos, liquid conditioners, styling products, treatments, and unaffected aerosol dry shampoo sprays.” If the Pantene, Aussie, Herbal Essences, Hair Food, and Waterless products you have at home are not present in the list of recalled products, you can continue to use them.
