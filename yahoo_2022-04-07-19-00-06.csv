4/7/2022,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's intelligence agency intercepted radio messages from Russian military sources discussing the killing of civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, German news magazine Der Spiegel reported on Thursday. It said the agency presented the findings in parliament on Wednesday, without giving a source for the information. Bucha, 37 km (23 miles) northwest of Kyiv, was occupied by Russian troops for more than a month following their Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Local officials say more than 300 people were killed by Russian forces in Bucha alone, and around 50 of them were executed. Moscow denies the accusations. According to Der Spiegel, the radio messages corresponded with known deaths. In one intercept, a soldier discusses shooting someone off their bicycle. A body was photographed lying next to a bicycle. Spiegel added that there were additional sound recordings whose physical origin was harder to pinpoint, which it said suggested similar events had occurred in other Ukrainian cities. Ukraine's government has accused Russia of genocide and war crimes. The Kremlin said on Tuesday that Western allegations Russian forces executed civilians in Bucha are a ""monstrous forgery"" meant to discredit the Russian army and justify new Western sanctions. Russia casts the evidence of civilian executions as a cynical ploy by Ukraine and its Western backers, who Moscow says are gripped by discriminatory anti-Russian paranoia. A German government spokesperson declined to comment on the Spiegel report.

4/7/2022,"Donald Trump used to bank with the big guns. Now he’s borrowing from Axos Financial, an obscure, internet-only institution based in San Diego and Las Vegas. In mid-February, Axos refinanced a $100 million Trump Tower mortgage due in September, a New York City Finance Department document shows. The new loan was made just days after The Trump Organization’s auditor resigned, saying that 10 years of the company’s financial statements could not be relied upon. In lending to The Trump Organization, Axos is stepping up when other banks have balked. But this is not unheard-of for Axos. An examination of legal filings, internal documents and land records shows Axos has a history of handling atypical loans. Axos has teamed up with nonbank lenders on loans to small businesses that carried cripplingly high double- and triple-digit effective annual interest rates, loan documents show. The bank has also specialized in loans to foreign nationals, internal documents and its website state, and has offered a type of loan that allows borrowers who paid cash for a property to turn around and instantly take money out. Such loans may pose money laundering risks, banking analysts say. The bank has also been sued by two former employees who say they were wrongfully fired after they raised questions about its practices. On March 21, Jennifer Brear Brinker, hired in 2018 to review the bank’s loan portfolios for its Governance, Risk Management and Compliance Department, filed suit against Axos in federal court in California. Brinker accused the bank of intentionally understaffing its compliance department “in an effort to conceal its failure to comply with federal banking regulations” and contends she was terminated in January 2021 while completing a report highlighting deficiencies at Axos including “significant issues in the bank’s anti-money laundering practices.” A spokesman for Axos, who asked not to be identified, said the bank disputes Brinker’s allegations “and her perception of the underlying factual circumstances.” Axos intends to defend against the lawsuit vigorously, the spokesman added. A lawyer representing Brinker declined to comment further on her case but said they both look forward to proving her claims in court. Later this month, Axos is scheduled to face a former internal auditor in a wrongful termination case in California federal court. That auditor, Charles Matthew Erhart, 35, was fired by Axos after he raised concerns about its practices, his 2015 lawsuit says. Among other practices alleged by Erhart — Axos allegedly failed to advise regulators of substantial and risky loans to dubious borrowers, did not disclose to regulators that it had received grand jury and other subpoenas, improperly denied that it held documents responsive to a Securities and Exchange Commission subpoena and instructed employees not to communicate with regulatory officials. The bank’s spokesman said it denies every one of Erhart’s allegations. “All were investigated, both internally by Axos’s audit committee and independent counsel, and externally by government regulators and outside auditors,” the statement said. “None of the investigations or audits found any merit in Erhart’s allegations.” Axos was founded in 2000 as Bank of Internet USA, or BofI, a digital enterprise with no brick-and-mortar branches; it changed its name to Axos in 2018. Its shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange. With $15.5 billion in assets at the end of 2021, Axos is a relatively small, federally chartered savings institution. J.P. Morgan Chase, by comparison, holds over $3 trillion in assets. Some $12.6 billion of Axos’ assets are loans, including residential mortgages and loans on commercial real estate and multi-family dwellings, SEC filings show. Axos is overseen by Gregory Garrabrants, a lawyer, former Goldman Sachs banker and McKinsey & Co. consultant. Before joining Axos in October 2007, Garrabrants was an executive at Indymac, a huge California savings & loan that collapsed in July 2008 under a mountain of toxic mortgages, according to bank regulators. Indymac was one of the nation’s biggest bank failures, costing the FDIC fund more than $10 billion, a government investigator estimated. Axos has been a fast grower and has turned in a torrid stock performance in recent years. In 2018, Garrabrants earned $27 million, just 10 percent less than the $30 million received by Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase. In lending to the Trump Organization, Axos is forging ties with a borrower that has proved troublesome for other banks over the years, with multiple bankruptcies more than a decade ago and many lawsuits. Axos declined to comment about the terms of the loan and the Trump Organization’s spokeswoman did not respond to an email seeking comment from NBC News. But Eric Trump told CNN in a statement that “Trump Tower is one of the most iconic properties in the world and sits on arguably the most prestigious corner in all of New York. We have incredibly low debt, have a tremendous amount of cash and have an extremely profitable company. We had no problem refinancing."" In September, Forbes valued the commercial office and retail space backing the $100 million Trump Tower mortgage Axos refinanced at $285 million; Gucci is a retail tenant on the ground floor, paying an estimated $24 million a year. The $100 million Trump Tower mortgage represents a large loan for a bank the size of Axos. As a savings association, Axos is subject to limits on loans to one borrower based on a measure of its capital. On June 30, 2021, that limit was $203.8 million, the bank’s filings show, and its largest outstanding loan balance was $145 million. For fiscal year 2021, Axos held $3.2 billion in commercial real estate loans, or 27.5 percent of its total loans. Most were on properties in California, its regulatory filings show. The new Trump Tower financing increases Axos’ lending in New York state by almost 30 percent, based on its December 2021 holdings. Axos held $4.4 billion in single-family mortgages in 2021 or 38 percent of its loans held for investment. In her lawsuit, former employee Brinker alleged that in 2020 Axos tried to conceal problems with home loans made to borrowers by A & D Mortgage, a Hollywood, Fla.-based nonbank mortgage lender financed by Axos. The bank failed to tell its board or its investors the loans had become problems, Brinker alleged. A&D Mortgage was funded by an Axos credit line for five years, from April 2016 to April 2021, Uniform Commercial Code filings show. A&D would sell the mortgages it had underwritten using Axos’s line of credit into a pool of loans packaged and issued by a related entity known as Imperial Fund Capital Partners. But when Covid struck, investors refused to buy the security and the loans remained as collateral backing Axos’s credit line for longer than the 60 days the bank’s policy allowed, according to Brinker’s lawsuit. A&D Mortgage is headed by Maksim Slyusarchuk, according to Florida corporate records, who described himself in a 2013 lawsuit he filed in Miami-Dade County as “an international businessman with experience in the Russian markets and in international finance.” Slyusarchuk also owns 50 percent of Imperial Fund Capital, an SEC registered investment adviser with $316 million under management; it pools mortgages into securities and sells them to investors. One of its units, Imperial Fund II LLC, is financed by Sovcombank, a UCC filing shows, Russia’s ninth largest bank. Sovcombank was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury on Feb. 24. Neither A&D Mortgage, Imperial Fund nor Slyusarchuk responded to an email message seeking comment. On its website, Axos says it has extensive experience in mortgage lending to “nonresident aliens” and offers loans of up to $20 million accompanied by 50 percent down payments. A 2014 investor presentation noted that the bank specialized in lending to Chinese nationals, for example, who do not have tax returns that they can present to document their financial standing. Axos has also made loans to Russian nationals; asked about the risk of such lending given the Ukraine invasion, the Axos spokesman said they represent a fraction of 1 percent of Axos’ loans. “All such loans were done at low loan-to-value ratios and are well secured,” he added. The 2014 Axos investor presentation also shows the bank offered so-called cash recapture loans, made to individuals paying cash in full for a property who want “to recoup some of their investment.” The bank required no waiting period to cash out, the presentation noted, but said the source of the initial purchase funds “must be sourced/seasoned.” Bank analysts say such loans may raise the risk of money laundering. The Axos spokesman said the bank conducts “a full, know-your-customer investigation” of each cash-recapture loan applicant. The loans are “subject to strict underwriting and program qualification parameters,” he said, “designed to ensure full compliance with Anti-Money Laundering and Bank Secrecy Act laws and all other legal or regulatory requirements.” Axos has also teamed up with some aggressive non-bank lenders charging sky-high interest rates to small business borrowers, NBC News has previously reported. The bank conducted some of these arrangements through its unit in Nevada, a state with no interest rate limits, allowing downstream lenders to evade state usury caps on loans they made to borrowers operating in more restrictive jurisdictions. Predatory lending experts call these arrangements “rent-a-bank schemes,” and they were permitted under a Trump-era banking rule. Last year, President Joe Biden signed a resolution rescinding the rule. Axos disputed that this business involved “rent-a-banks” and said its operation was “a bank sponsorship program, operated so as to be fully compliant with legal and regulatory requirements, through which it entered into agreements with several third-party service providers.” All but one of these programs have been wound down, the spokesman added. In recent years, Axos has aggressively pursued anonymous bloggers who posted critical analyses of the bank’s activities on investing websites, court documents show. In 2017, Axos joined forces with top executives at MiMedx Group, a formerly high-flying maker of skin grafts, to identify anonymous critics of the companies. Axos and MiMedx entered into a “joint interest agreement” to investigate the critics, court documents and internal emails show. Two of the top MiMedx executives with whom Axos pursued the joint interest agreement — former chief executive Parker Petit and former COO William Taylor — were convicted of fraud in 2021 and sentenced to jail in a case unrelated to Axos. Much of what had been alleged about MiMedx by the critics it targeted turned out to be accurate, the criminal case showed. A spokeswoman for MiMedx said the company does not comment on legal matters but noted that its “senior leadership team and board of directors are entirely new since 2019.” Regarding its arrangement with the convicted former MiMedx executives, the Axos spokesman said that when it struck the agreement with Petit and Taylor, Axos needed to communicate with MiMedx about the activities of investors who had bet against both companies and publicized those bets. He added that “the truth of allegations against MiMedx was unknown and the company and its executives appeared to enjoy a favorable reputation.” Later this month, the 2015 wrongful termination case filed by Erhart, the former Axos auditor, is scheduled to go to trial. Erhart‘s lawyer, Carol Gillam, declined to comment on the case. Erhart began working at Bank of Internet, as Axos was known at the time, in Sept. 2013, documents show. Previously an examiner at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, he’d led an examination that identified a broker who allegedly stole $4.2 million from his customers, his lawyer said. A native of rural Kansas who put himself through the University of Kansas working on an assembly line and a road construction crew, Erhart began identifying problems soon after he was hired at Axos, according to his complaint. He says he expressed concerns about concentration risk at the bank, for example, noting to superiors that just nine of its customers accounted for 40 percent of its total deposits. Erhart alleges that he was advised by his boss’s superior not to put that information in an email. Some of Erhart’s allegations about Axos’s practices had to do with the Bank Secrecy Act, which aims to curtail and detect money laundering and loans to what banking regulators call “politically exposed persons.” They are people who, because of their public positions or relationships, “may present a risk higher than other customers by having access to funds that may be the proceeds of corruption or other illicit activity.” Banks are supposed to collect information about customers’ risk profiles to monitor and determine whether a client’s banking activities are suspicious. Erhart contended in his lawsuit the bank made material alterations of “numerous reports” required under the Bank Secrecy Act’s quality control rules and did not disclose substantial loans to criminals and politically exposed persons. In early 2015, Erhart’s complaint says, he uncovered information about borrowers who exposed the bank to reputation risk, including “very high level foreign officials from major oil-producing countries and war zones.” He did not identify specific borrowers in the complaint. In March 2015, Erhart turned over bank records to Axos’s main regulator, the Treasury Department’s Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, his complaint said. He emailed the information he had compiled to his mother for safekeeping. He was fired in June 2015. The OCC has not taken regulatory action against the bank. Erhart now works as a partner at a cryptocurrency consulting firm. “In the years since Erhart first made his allegations,” the bank’s spokesman said, “Axos has suffered no adverse business event, no restatement, no spike in reserves, no loss of a major contract, no material weakness disclosure, no earnings miss. Independent auditors and government regulators — all with full knowledge of all Erhart’s allegations — have consistently issued clean audit opinions, passed examinations, and granted further regulatory approvals for more than seven full years.” Asked to supply copies of the clean audit opinions and examinations, Axos declined, saying they are confidential. The company did supply a copy of a 2017 letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission saying it had closed an investigation into Axos and did not intend to recommend an enforcement action against the bank. Still, the SEC said its letter “must in no way be construed as indicating that the party has been exonerated or that no action may ultimately result from the staff’s investigation.” In a separate civil case in 2017, Garrabrants sued Erhart alleging that he had stolen his confidential information. The bank also sued Erhart’s mother in Kansas, to whom the former auditor had sent information about the bank’s activities for backup. Axos settled the case against Erhart’s mother; it declined to state the terms. Garrabrants’ case against Erhart went to trial last fall. The jury found that Erhart had violated California law “in connection with theft of Garrabrants’ personal, confidential, and financial information,” the bank’s spokesman said. Gillam, Erhart’s lawyer, provided a statement on this suit. “The documents Mr. Erhart accessed that related to Mr. Garrabrants were in bank files he found in the course of doing his work as an internal auditor,” she said. “They were only used to support Mr. Erhart’s allegations of wrongdoing that he presented to the bank’s principal regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.” The jury “rejected Garrabrants’ claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress and awarded him $1,500 on an invasion of privacy claim,” Gillam added. On an anti-hacking allegation, the jury awarded $1 to Garrabrants, an amount he had requested. Erhart is appealing that verdict, Gillam said. In late February, Axos also entered into a settlement agreement with a Houston Municipal pension fund that had sued the bank in 2015. That matter, which became a class action, alleged securities fraud largely based on Erhart’s allegations. The terms of the settlement have not yet been made public. When asked why the bank was settling now, its spokesman said: “While Axos continues to believe that it would have prevailed at trial, this settlement allows Axos to avoid the distraction and continued expense of litigation.”",Business/NBC News,The Trump Organization used to borrow from major banks.

4/7/2022,"Ava Majury is a 15-year-old TikToker whose father shot and killed her alleged stalker in July 2021. Last month, Majury testified against a second man she said stalked her. The case was dismissed. Majury's lawyer told Insider she wants to stay on social media to warn others about online threats. In 2021, 15-year-old Florida-based TikToker Ava Majury made headlines when her father shot and killed a man she said was stalking her after he showed up at their front door. A year later, on March 28, 2022, Majury testified against a second person she accused of harassing her online and stalking her. Majury, who has 1.2 million TikTok followers, said she was ""terrified"" of the second individual she accused of stalking her, who went to the same school as her, and who she said frequently followed her. The case was dismissed by the court on the day of the hearing. boogie hit The case, and the events leading up to it, have been widely reported, tracing the 15-year-old's journey from teen TikTok star to alleged stalking victim. Despite her tumultuous years as an influencer, Majury said she has no plans to quit social media. Here is a timeline of Majury's career and legal battles over the past few years. Majury moved to Naples, Florida, from New Jersey with her parents and two brothers in 2019, according to The New York Times. She joined TikTok in April 2020 and was best known for dancing and lip-syncing — one of the earliest popular formats on the app. The Times reported that she gained a million TikTok followers within a year, and 75% of them were male. von you better not touch him In a February 2022 interview, Majury told The Times' Elizabeth Williamson that she was able to make around $1,000 for a single paid promotional video on her main account. According to Majury's managers, she also posts under two other accounts. None of the three profiles have been verified by TikTok as belonging to Majury, but a representative from her law firm confirmed to Insider they were owned by her. Majury began posting on Instagram in August 2020, gaining 130,000 followers within a month according to analytics tracker SocialBlade. Majury now has 327,000 Instagram followers. This account is also not verified by Instagram, but her a representative from Majury's legal team confirmed to Insider this account also belonged to her. Lanny J Davis, legal advisor to the Majury family, told Insider that in early 2021, the TikToker noticed that an individual with the username EricJustin111 was messaging her on Snapchat and Instagram. Davis said she would occasionally reply to him, as she did with other fans. According to an Instagram statement uploaded to an account under Majury's name in February 2022, the individual started ""harassing"" her online after a few months, so she sent him ""2 to 3"" Snapchat photos for $5 each over the space of a month because she thought this would end the harassment. She said he then asked for explicit images, so she blocked him. The Majury family told The Times that on July 10, 2021, the fan, who has since been identified as Eric Rohan Justin and was 18 at the time, flew from his home in Elliot City, Maryland, to Majury's Florida address. They also said he had a shotgun. Police did not disclose details of the incident at the time. The Times reported in February 2022 that Justin ""arrived with a shotgun at the Majury family home in Naples and blew open the front door. His weapon jammed; Ava's father, Rob Majury, a retired police lieutenant, chased him off but fell."" Rob told the Collier County Sherriff's office that he decided to stand guard at the front door, and when Justin returned, he shot and killed him, according to The Times. Rob Majury was not prosecuted for shooting Justin because his actions were deemed to fall under Florida's ""Stand your ground"" legislation, which was passed in 2005. It states that, ""A person is justified in using or threatening to use deadly force if he or she reasonably believes that using or threatening to use such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another."" A 2020 US Civil Rights Commission report on the law found that similar legislation, sometimes referred to as a ""Castle Doctrine,"" has been passed in at least 22 other states, and remains controversial. The Florida statute drew particular criticism in 2013 when George Zimmerman was found not guilty of murder after fatally shooting 17-year-old Trayvon Martin (although whether the law itself was responsible for his acquittal is disputed). As previously reported by Insider, Majury continued to post on TikTok the day after the shooting, before taking a five-day break from uploading. In their interview with The Times, Ava's parents said they pulled Majury, now 15, out of school due to concerns about a second person she accused of stalking her, who they say was communicating with Justin around the time the shooting took place. In December 2021, Majury told her parents the person had started watching and following her. Davis told Insider that the unnamed juvenile posted a video on his Snapchat account, which Majury could view, that showed him firing a gun at a shooting range. Davis said the video made Majury ""fearful,"" and she decided to leave school. The Majury family filed a petition in Collier County Court seeking an injunction against stalking, and a hearing was set for February 28, 2022, according to Fox News. Majury's hearing took place on March 28, and the 15-year-old testified against the individual she accused of stalking her, saying she was ""terrified"" because he was ""was always behind"" or near her during the fall semester at school, Fox News reported. According to Fox News, Majury testified she believed the individual was on speaking terms with Justin prior to his death. She said she sometimes asked the second individual to send her information about Justin. She added that he had sent her screenshots of his conversations with Justin, one of which contained a grape emoji in a message from Justin reading ""I want to [emoji] her bro."" She said the emoji is sometimes used by young people to mean ""rape."" The individual's attorney argued there was no case for stalking because he was voluntarily communicating with Majury at her request, according to Fox News. At the end of the hearing, the judge dismissed the case. Davis, who was present in the court during the hearing, told Insider the Majury family do not intend on taking any further legal action. Davis told Insider that Majury's main TikTok account, which had 1.2 million followers, was temporarily suspended by TikTok for around two weeks, but the reasons were unclear. TikTok did not respond to Insider's request for comment, but on April 4, the account was restored. Davis told Insider that Majury does not want the experience with Justin to ""defeat her,"" and will continue to post on her platform with permission from her parents, who he said ""support their daughter in her conviction to be a role model for clean and positive use of social media."" been a min In a statement to Insider, Majury said she was telling her story ""so that young people and parents are also aware of the dangers of social media."" She added, ""I could never have imagined my innocent posts would result in a stranger showing up at my front door with a shotgun. I urge young people and parents to immediately report any threat or signal of violence, and not wait until it's too late.""
