3/21/2022,"Seized yachts owned by sanctioned Russian oligarchs hang in limbo as European authorities decide next steps. Annual maintenance for some of the yachts costs as much as $115.6 million. Without proper care, some of the megayachts could deteriorate in a matter of weeks, experts say. Dozens of superyachts seized from Russian oligarchs and collectively worth billions of dollars could quickly waste away in a matter of weeks if they're not properly cared for — a process that requires millions of dollars. The yachts and their billionaire owners, many of which are among Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest allies, were included in a series of sweeping global sanctions recently imposed against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this month, Italy seized a $578 million megayacht belonging to Andrey Melnichenko, France seized a $120 million vessel owned by Igor Sechin, and Spain seized a $153 million superyacht linked to Sergei Chemezov. Insider spoke with four experts who described how the sanctions against Russia — which they say are more extensive than any other coordinated global round of sanctions in history — could lead to lengthy court battles and the deprecation of the world's most expensive superyachts. ""Yachts will start to deteriorate as soon as the maintenance program is relaxed,"" Benjamin Maltby, partner at Keystone Law in the UK and an expert in yacht and luxury asset law, told Insider. ""Cleaning surfaces, and checking equipment operation is continual."" Todd Roberts, president of Marine Boat Works in California, told Insider that yachts are typically seized for sales purposes, meaning the impounder has a vested interest in maintaining the yacht and its value. However, the sanctions have made the process more murky. The sanctions do not allow countries to take ownership of the yachts and the Russian billionaires remain the beneficiaries, though the assets are effectively frozen and blocked from use. And while the Russian oligarchs are still technically responsible for paying for yacht maintenance, it is likely they will either refuse to pay or European authorities will encounter difficulty collecting the funds due to sanctions on financial transactions with the billionaires. In the meantime, it remains unclear who will foot the multimillion dollar bill. According to Maltby, the maintenance cost of a yacht usually totals about 15% to 20% of its overall value. For Melnichenko's yacht, for example, that would translate to up to $115.6 million in annual expenses. Even foregoing the costs to staff, repair, fuel, and insure the ship, the costs to dock the yacht can quickly add up. Roberts said docking fees alone typically cost tens of thousands of dollars per month. Without proper care, vessels can lose about 30% of their value, according to Roberts. What's more, if a superyacht were to go without its crew — which typically includes a staff of 25 or more — the vessel could quickly fail official inspections and ultimately lose its insurance due to concerns related to functionality and environmental risk. Without insurance, the yacht would be unable to dock in most ports, harbors, or marinas around the world. Maltby told Insider he expects most crews to walk away from the seized vessels because their pay will likely be comprised, leaving European authorities in the lurch when it comes to deciding what to do with the assets. Last week, the crew of Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov's 512-foot superyacht was fired after sanctions prevented the staff from receiving their wages. ""This is almost completely uncharted territory,"" Roberts said. ""I don't think any of us fully understand what it will mean for the industry.""

3/21/2022,"The daughter of a banker allegedly connected with Russia's security service had access to some top UK politicians. One of the political organizations, the CFCC, she was working for has now cut ties. The CFCC said they ""condemn Russia's barbaric and illegal actions in invading Ukraine."" One of the Conservative groups who Ilma Bogdan was working for has cut ties, following an Insider article highlighting her relationship with a man accused of having links with the Russian security services. The Conservative Foreign and Commonwealth Council was one of several Tory affiliates that Bogdan was linked to. She was listed as an executive committee member on CCFC's website and on her LinkedIn profile. On Friday, Insider revealed that she was the daughter of Leonard Bogdan, whose name has been raised during two recent debates in the House of Commons. In January, Labour MP Liam Byrne said he was ""a man with very interesting friends in the FSB and the SVR."" A few days later, Byrne said his sources claim Leonard Bogdan ""has a definite FSB background."" The FSB and SVR are Russia's security and intelligence agencies that act as successors to the KGB. Ilma Bogdan confirmed that Leonard was her father but said he ""he doesn't have any connection with the FSB whatsoever."" She later tweeted to clarify her ""unequivocal"" position was against ""the Kremlin's decision to invade Ukraine, a sovereign country."" On Sunday, CCFC confirmed it had cut ties, saying ""the lady in question no longer has any connection"" with the group. In a statement, the council added: ""The CFCC and United Kingdom will continue to exert pressure at all levels to oppose Putin's act of aggression, including through sanctions, humanitarian aid, and diplomatic action. ""The CFCC and UK condemn Russia's barbaric and illegal actions in invading Ukraine and convey our admiration for the steadfast resistance of the Ukrainian people in the face of tyranny. The CFCC and the United Kingdom stand with Ukraine.""

 A Ukrainian historian wrote in an opinion piece in The New York Times on Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin made two major miscalculations regarding the invasion of Ukraine. Yaroslav Hrytsak, a historian and professor at the Ukrainian Catholic University, wrote that ""Russian aggression has been met with heroic Ukrainian resistance and united the West."" He referred to Putin as a ""master tactician but inept strategist"" and said he has made his most profound miscalculation by not anticipating a response from the West and Ukrainian resistance. ""First, he was hoping that, as had been the case with his war against Georgia, the West would tacitly swallow his aggression against Ukraine. A unified response from the West was not something he expected. Second, since in his mind Russians and Ukrainians were one nation, Mr. Putin believed Russian troops needed barely to enter Ukraine to be welcomed with flowers. This never materialized,"" he wrote. Hrytsak wrote that despite Putin likely escalating the conflict further, ""he is far from the military victory he sought."" He added that Putin believes ""he is at war not with Ukraine but with the West in Ukrainian lands."" ""It's essential to grasp this point. The only way to defeat him is to turn his belief - that Ukraine is fighting not alone but with the help of the West and as part of the West - into a waking nightmare,"" Hrytsak wrote. The piece comes more than three weeks after Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine, where it has yet to capture the capital of Kyiv. According to Hrytsak, the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014, which saw the annexation of Crimea along with the capture of parts of the Donbas region under Russian-backed separatists, confirmed that the distinction between Ukrainians and Russians ""lies not in language, religion or culture - here they are relatively close - but in political traditions."" ""Simply put, a victorious democratic revolution is almost impossible in Russia, whereas a viable authoritarian government is almost impossible in Ukraine,"" he wrote.",World/The Hill,Ukrainian historian: Putin made two huge miscalculations,https://news.yahoo.com/ukrainian-historian-putin-made-two-141838784.html
