4/7/2022,"Jaime Harrison called Tom Cotton the ""lowest of the low"" and a ""little maggot-infested man."" Harrison was outraged by Cotton's suggestion that Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson might have defended Nazis accused of war crimes. Harrison also called the GOP ""a party built on fraud, fear, and fascism."" Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison slammed Sen. Tom Cotton on Wednesday, calling him the ""lowest of the low"" and a ""little maggot-infested man"" after the Arkansas Republican suggested that Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson might have defended Nazis accused of war crimes. ""In a Senate where there is Ted Cruz and Lindsey Graham, Tom Cotton is the lowest of the low,"" Harrison said on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" Harrison took particular offense to Cotton's suggestion that Biden's Supreme Court nominee might have defended Nazis during the Nuremberg trials. A possible future presidential candidate, Cotton was repeating the GOP's misleading attacks on Jackson's defense of Guantanamo Bay detainees during her time as a federal public defender and later in private practice. Cotton referenced Justice Robert Jackson, who famously took a leave from the Supreme Court to lead the allies' prosecution of top Nazi officers at the Nuremberg trials, in his latest attack. Jackson was also a staunch defender of the rule of law and the necessity for all accused people to receive a zealous defense. ""You know, the last Judge Jackson left the Supreme Court to go Nuremberg and prosecute the case against the Nazis,"" Cotton said on the Senate floor. ""This Judge Jackson might've gone there to defend them."" Harrison went on to recount a disputed anecdote about Cotton's blocking of Cassandra Butts, President Barack Obama's nominee to become US Ambassador to the Bahamas. Butts, who was a law school classmate and close friend of the then-president, died in 2016 following an acute leukemia diagnosis. Her nomination had stalled for more than 820 days before her death. Butts told New York Times columnist Frank Bruni that Cotton told her that he was blocking her nomination in part as a way to twist the knife in Obama. Bruni described it as ""a way to inflict special pain on the president"" and wrote that Cotton's office did not dispute the account of the meeting. But Cotton's office did later dispute his characterization of Butts' conversation with Cotton, especially the notion that he callously blocked Butts' nomination, The Daily Caller wrote at the time. Harrison said that Cotton's conduct shows that ""he doesn't deserve to be in the United States Senate"" and is indicative of a broader moral stain on the Republican Party. ""It is a party built on fraud, fear, and fascism,"" Harrison said. ""And They don't deserve to be in power. Not because Democrats should, but because they don't deserve to be in power of this great nation."" A spokesperson for Cotton did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

4/7/2022,"courtesy Tiffany Robertson In her teens, Tiffany Robertson dreamed her soulful singing voice would carry her to stardom — she won dozens of talent competitions and twice made it to the semi-final auditions of American Idol, says her mother, Virginia Krieger. But Robertson's life was cut short when the talented vocalist from northeastern Ohio was hanging out with friends and took drugs mixed with the lethal opioid fentanyl. She died of an overdose at the age of 26 on Feb. 2, 2015. ""She was a young mother and the light of my life,"" Krieger tells PEOPLE of her late daughter. ""To lose her that way was a shock and we're still suffering from her loss."" More than 100,000 Americans died of drug overdoses last year — the majority of them caused by fentanyl, a lethal synthetic opioid that is commonly mixed with street drugs like heroin and cocaine and also found in counterfeit medications sold on social media, experts say. As co-president of Lost Voices of Fentanyl, Krieger, 56, now spends her days doing anti-drug advocacy work, supporting parents bereaved by fentanyl deaths and raising awareness about the proliferation of the cheap and readily available synthetic opioid. ""The contamination with fentanyl of commonly used party drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy has moved the opioid crisis into a whole new population of young people,"" says Krieger. Drug dealers and manufacturers now secretly mix in fentanyl, which is cheaper than other drugs and up to 100 times more powerful than morphine. ""It's the new paradigm,"" says Krieger.

This new form of drug use entangles people from all walks of life and all types of drugs, including not just addicts but also people of all age groups who use drugs casually or recreationally. ""Parents need to warn their children that any recreational drug use puts them at high risk of exposing themselves to fentanyl,"" she says. ""A large number of victims are not even aware they were consuming fentanyl."" Speaking from personal experience, Krieger says the impact of the sudden death of a child with no known history of heavy drug use can be overwhelming for families. ""The parents need help,"" she says, adding that nine mothers from drug-death discussion groups she belongs to have been lost to suicide. ""They couldn't live with the pain of burying their children."" RELATED: Warning Signs to Look for If You Are Concerned Someone Is Suicidal COURTESY Alexa Fleming  Christina Gribbin Tammy Leslie says her daughter, Christina Gribbin, had no idea she was taking the fentanyl that caused her death in 2020. The 25-year-old Pennsylvania native was hanging out with a couple of men who purchased some cocaine and offered it to her. ""You don't think you're going to die from a line of coke,"" says Leslie. ""My daughter Christina didn't have a death wish. She wouldn't have left her young sons."" RELATED: Faces of an Epidemic: Stories of the Victims of America's Opioid Crisis — and the Fight to Save Lives But the coke contained fentanyl, and Christina died shortly after ingesting it. The men she was with folded her lifeless body into a suitcase and left it on a public-transportation platform in an area of Philadelphia known as open-air drug market, Leslie says. ""I couldn't get those images out of my brain for a very long time, just the whole idea of what happened,"" says Leslie, who is now raising her daughter's children. ""Anyone can die, whether they're a first-time user or an addict, if they're not aware a drug has fentanyl in it,"" she adds. Steve Filson  Jessica Filson Retired San Bernardino police officer Steve Filson says he never thought that he, of all people, could lose a family member to drug use. But in 2020, his daughter, Jessica, 29, and her boyfriend were found dead in their San Bernardino County home. They had snorted some cocaine while celebrating her boyfriend's birthday; it contained a lethal dose of fentanyl. RELATED: Meet the Tennessee Mom Working to End the Opioid Epidemic: 'We Need Empathy and Compassion' Filson says that no one can safely use recreational drugs anymore: ""People have to understand that the introduction of this synthetic opiate into our society, and into recreational narcotics such as cocaine, changes the narrative.

4/7/2022,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) -Hungary's foreign ministry summoned Ukraine's ambassador on Wednesday over what it called offensive comments from Kyiv regarding Budapest's stance on Russia's invasion. Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, in comments released three days after nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban was re-elected, said Hungary had condemned Russia's invasion, acknowledged Ukraine's sovereignty and taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing the war. So it was ""time for Ukrainian leaders to stop their insults directed at Hungary and acknowledge the will of the Hungarian people,"" Szijjarto said in a statement, referring to Sunday's landslide election win. ""This is not our war, so we want to and will stay out of it,"" Szijjarto added, reiterating the stance that helped Orban win a fourth consecutive term. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Tuesday said Orban feared Russia's influence and would have to choose between Moscow and the ""other world"". Orban, who easily won what pollsters had until shortly before election day tipped to be a close vote, has condemned Russia's invasion, which the Kremlin describes as a ""special military operation"", and not vetoed European Union sanctions against Moscow. But he has refrained from criticising President Vladimir Putin directly and said he does not agree with sanctions, rejecting the idea of curbs on oil and gas imports from Russia, saying that would wreck Hungary's economy. The EU moved quickly and decisively to impose an unprecedented range of sanctions on Moscow after the invasion, but has struggled to remain united over banning oil and gas imports because so many member states rely heavily on Russian energy. Orban scored a landslide win in Sunday's election, as voters endorsed his self-declared vision of a conservative, illiberal state and shrugged off concerns over Budapest's decade-long close business ties with Moscow. Long a thorn in the side of European Union authorities in Brussels, Orban has faced rare criticism from his nationalist allies in neighbouring Poland over his cautious stance on the war.
