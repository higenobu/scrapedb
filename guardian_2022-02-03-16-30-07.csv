2/3/2022,"Vladimir Putin has stepped up his criticism of the US and Britain for staging a diplomatic boycott of the Winter Games in Beijing, accusing western countries of politicising sport and violating the Olympic charter, which promotes peaceful competition among nations. A number of western countries, which also include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia and Lithuania have refused to send officials to Beijing for Friday’s opening ceremony in protest at human rights abuses by the Chinese government.  However the Russian president told China’s official news agency Xinhua that he questioned their motives. “Unfortunately, attempts by a number of countries to politicise sports issues for the sake of their ambitions have recently intensified.” Putin said. “This is fundamentally wrong and contradicts the very spirit and principles of the Olympic Charter.” “The power and greatness of sports are that it brings people together, gives moments of triumph and pride for the country and delights with fair, just and uncompromising competition,” he added. “And these approaches are shared by most of the states participating in the International Olympic movement. Putin, who is in Beijing for the opening ceremony, has previously said that a diplomatic boycott by the west was a mistake driven by a desire to restrain China’s development. However the Russian president predicted that Beijing 2022 would be a success, telling Russian news agency, Tass: “I am convinced that China’s rich experience in the flawless organisation of representative international competitions will make it possible to hold this world sports festival at the highest level. “Our Chinese friends have done a great job for high-quality preparations for the Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games.” The Kremlin said that Putin’s visit would include top-level talks with Chinese president Xi Jinping to discuss “a Russian-Chinese comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation.” The two leaders will also review topical international and regional matters,” a statement added. However he will not hold talks with other leaders, even though Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky is also expected to attend the opening ceremony. Meanwhile, the International Olympic Committee president, Thomas Bach, said he was proud to have averted the threat of an athletic boycott in Beijing. “You may remember that at our IOC Sessions in January and July 2020, we could already see the dark clouds of the growing politicisation of sport on the horizon,” Bach told IOC delegates. “We also saw that in some peoples’ minds, the boycott ghosts of the past were rearing their ugly heads again. “This is why we have been working even harder to get the unifying mission of the Olympic Games across to as many leaders and decision-makers as possible: the United Nations, the G20 leaders, intergovernmental organisations and national governments, individual politicians and many, many more. “In all these conversations we stressed that the Olympic Games can only accomplish this unifying mission, that we can only get all humanity together in all our diversity, if the Games stand beyond all differences and political disputes,” he added. “We appealed to them to respect this and thereby to support this precious mission of the Olympic Games. Today we can be happy and proud that apparently this message got through.”",Sport/Sport,Vladimir Putin claims Beijing Olympics diplomatic boycott about ‘ambitions’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/03/vladimir-putin-claims-beijing-olympics-diplomatic-boycott-about-ambitions
2/3/2022,"The Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest has launched criminal proceedings against Facebook for failing to take action on scam ads featuring his image. A Guardian investigation into the scam ads sheds light on how the scam works and what the ads look like.  The ads appear on Facebook or on news sites as “programmatic ads” supplied by Google. Programmatic ads target individual users. These ads use images of celebrities or other well-known people in the regions they are targeting, such as Forrest or Dick Smith in Australia. They are presented as a news story claiming the celebrity has made a “big investment” and the banks are shocked by how well it is doing. If you click on the ad, it takes you to a fake news story that includes a link claiming to be a cryptocurrency investment scheme. If you enter details to register for the scheme, you receive a phone call typically asking you to invest a small sum, such as US$250. You are then asked to invest increasingly larger amounts. In one case that Guardian Australia previously reported, a 77-year-old Queensland grandmother clicked through from a Facebook ad featuring Forrest. She initially transferred $5,000 to a cryptocurrency exchange before being encouraged to put in more of her money. Scammers eventually emptied her accounts, stealing her entire life savings of $80,000. She was unable to get her money back. Some of the scams encourage people to invest in highly risky and often unregulated forex trading platforms where they are likely to lose most, if not all, of their money. The worst of the scams encourage people to hand over more and more money in an attempt to get their initial investment back, leading them to greater losses. An international investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project reported that contact details of people who signed up for such services were also passed on to brokers offering other risky or illegitimate investments. These scams accelerated during the initial phase of the Covid-19 pandemic. The normal approach to stopping these sorts of ads is to block the website hosting them, or by looking for specific “keywords” in the ad text and banning those from being used. Google said in 2019 it removed about 5,000 ads a minute, or about 2.7bn in a year. But it is a game of cat and mouse. The scammers change ad text frequently to evade capture and to avoid domain blocking. Using a variety of domain registration companies, they buy hundreds of domain names every month to host the pages that users are directed to when they click on the ads. If you are viewing the scam websites outside the targeted location, they can look like innocuous sites for cooking, or gardens or fruit. The investigation by Guardian Australia found that hundreds of these sites were registered under just five names, all with addresses in the centre of Moscow. None of those listed on the registration forms responded to attempts to contact them. The scams may also be based in Ukraine, as the scam sites do not allow people to register a phone number form there. A previous OCCRP investigation found a call centre running similar celebrity-based investment scams operating from the nation’s capital, Kyiv. In Australia, regulators have admitted it is difficult to trace and stop these scams. A spokesperson for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said the ads had been traced back to overseas. The ACCC had managed to get a handful of the sites removed by contacting the domain hosts. In the UK there has been more success, in large part due to a dedicated site where the public can report suspected scam websites. The country’s cybersecurity agency removed over 731,000 celebrity scam sites between April and December 2020.",Lifestyle/Money,Scam ads: why an Australian billionaire is launching legal action against Facebook,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/03/scam-ads-why-an-australian-billionaire-is-launching-legal-action-against-facebook
2/3/2022,"Even in the turbulent, conflict-wracked Sahel region of Africa, the recent military takeover in Burkina Faso was intriguing. Amid the deteriorating security and humanitarian situation, the decision by neighbouring Mali’s military-led government to invite fighters from the Wagner Group, widely seen as a paramilitary network of mercenaries with Russian connections, is causing growing concern in many western capitals. Mali’s transitional government faces a rough road to recognition after the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) announced a strengthening of economic and diplomatic sanctions in January in response to the proposal to postpone elections until at least 2026.  Burkina Faso’s Lt Col Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba is just the latest military leader to grab power in front of Russian flag-waving supporters. It came less than a year after Mali went through its second coup in 12 months, and third in 10 years, while in September a coup in neighbouring Guinea saw special forces commander Col Mamady Doumbouya gain control. France, the former colonial power in all three countries, faces a monumental task to reassert its authority in the vast Sahel, located south of the Sahara, in the face of rising Russian influence in Africa. It is a region where anti-French sentiment is growing on social media and on the ground, at the same time as popular support rises for the Russians, scuttling France’s efforts to bring peace. This week, the French ambassador has been asked to leave Mali, bringing into question whether Air France, one of the last remaining international carriers operating in the country, will resume its flights to the capital, Bamako, in March as planned. With tensions heightened over the military buildup on the Ukrainian border, Russia’s expanding presence in Africa should also give the west plenty to think about. Central African Republic (CAR), another former French colony, is already working closely with the Wagner Group, which the US and the UN accuse of committing human rights abuses in the region. It was while investigating the Wagner Group’s activities in CAR in 2018 that Orkhan Dzhemal, a Russian war reporter known for his critical reports on Russia’s policies, was mysteriously killed alongside two fellow Russian journalists. But Mali’s leaders continue to downplay the presence of the mercenaries, saying they are simply cooperating with “Russian trainers”. A European military taskforce coordinating the fight against the growing Islamist insurgency in the landlocked country, has confirmed Russian proxy forces are active in Mali. Mali’s decision to turn to the Russians is already causing a rift between the gold-rich country and its European partners, including the UK and France. Mali argues that France’s decision to withdraw some of its 5,000-strong force from the west African country has left a huge void. Russia, seizing every opportunity to boost its influence in Africa, has moved in. The Kremlin accuses the west of sour grapes, and while it has confirmed its support for Mali, it denies links to the Wagner Group. France, leading calls for EU sanctions in Mali, is changing its strategy, preferring a collective European effort through the European Takuba taskforce. Those plans suffered a setback last week when the military-dominated government asked the Danish troops to leave. Sweden has also confirmed its withdrawal from the taskforce. The Sahel, home to some of the world’s poorest nations, including Mauritania, Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad, is beset by problems ranging from recurring food crises and poorly policed borders to escalating armed conflict. Human rights violations are reportedly on the rise. There are reports of repeated attacks on civilians in villages and towns near Mali’s borders with Burkina Faso and Mauritania. Russian mercenaries frequently mistake civilians for the jihadist militants marauding across the region and Russians have also suffered casualties in combat with the groups. To make matters worse, lingering security concerns in northern Nigeria and CAR are pushing thousands of people to seek refuge in other Sahel nations, further fuelling tensions in a region on its knees. But Russia is going beyond the conflict-ridden countries, increasing its geopolitical influence across Africa. St Petersburg will host the second Russia-Africa summit later this year. Russian trade and investment in Africa is small but increasing. A deal to establish a naval base in Sudan has boosted Moscow’s military foothold in the continent. Gaining leverage by supporting isolated political leaders follows the script Russia has successfully used elsewhere, including in Syria, Libya and eastern Ukraine. In CAR, this was accompanied by Russian Valery Zakharov being appointed the country’s national security adviser. Covid-19 has also offered the Russians an opportunity. Last year, Russia donated more than 300m Sputnik V doses to the African Union. Several African countries have reportedly approved the vaccine, helping spread Moscow’s influence.

2/3/2022,"“Creeping authoritarianism” is the wolf of the left, and we cry it all the time: I remember, almost nostalgically, thinking David Cameron was a creeping authoritarian for outsourcing punitive benefits initiatives to private companies; and that Theresa May was one when she earned the dubious accolade of politician least likely to answer the question in a broadcast interview. However, there is no ignoring or denying the vastly more anti-democratic manoeuvres of Boris Johnson’s government. The elections bill, currently in the Lords, features mandatory photo ID, which is well known to disfranchise younger and lower-income voters. It poses a direct threat to the reach and independence of the Electoral Commission, has serious implications for who can and cannot campaign at election time, and extends the perverse first-past-the-post voting system to the election of mayors and police commissioners. Beyond the explicit restriction of democracy, there is no plausible rationale for the bill; and unsettlingly, very little attempt has been made to produce one.  Make Votes Matter has organised a protest against it this Sunday, which feels slightly poignant, under the shadow of the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill, which would make the attendance of such a demonstration fraught with real personal risk. This, too, has moved to the House of Lords, having passed its first stage last July. It contains many chilling provisions: the extension of stop and search; a new crime of interfering with “key infrastructure”; and the introduction of the “protest asbo”, a serious disruption prevention order that (the clue is in the name) you can get before you’ve actually disrupted anything. It was plainly framed with environmental protests in its sights, and indeed its advocates use the techniques of Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain – the traffic-blocking and pavement-gluing – as their proof that the current law is too lax. Yet you only need to look at the Sarah Everard vigil to see what happens when police powers over demonstrators are extended – in that case, by Covid legislation. This bill would affect the right to assemble in every particular and every instance. More sickening still is the nationality and borders bill, which makes it easier to strip the citizenship of anyone with a second nationality to fall back on, thereby creating a two-tier system of rights: white Britons at the top, minority-ethnic Britons at the bottom. Many of these measures, if they did pass into law, would struggle to get past the Human Rights Act: but that, too, has been under constant attack from the right wing of the Conservative party, with a consultation announced yesterday that is nothing short of a provocation (Prof Francesca Klug and Dr Natalie Sedacca will lay out the implications more fully at an online event next week). Then there are the atmospherics, memorably listed by Anthony Barnett: a prime minister who doesn’t bother with the truth and everybody knows he doesn’t; who “dresses up in the occupational costumes they wear in laboratories, hospitals and fish merchants (he has a particular liking for fish and crabs)”; who removes himself from scrutiny; who always smiles, and “everyone around him smiles”. These are the optics of a mini-dictator, while those around him create the conditions for him to remain in power perpetually. But there’s a hitch: what happens when the people around him stop smiling? What happens when the lies suddenly do matter? What happens when his party unity is shot? What happens when the anger reaches beyond Extinction Rebellion? To perform as badly as Boris Johnson is currently doing, to openly lie and spread untruths in the House of Commons, to breach your own rules so flagrantly and be so openly unrepentant, you really need the power of an actual dictator. You need to be able to throw your critics in jail. It’s not enough that you might, soon, be able to imprison members of Insulate Britain. You need to be able to shut down the phonelines of LBC and restrict access to the internet on a whim. Authoritarianism, if it’s to have any protective power for such inadequacy, has to go a lot faster than a creep. It’s peculiar that Johnson, with his expensive and so often flaunted education, didn’t think this through. Temperamentally, he is unsuited to the full implications and demands of his own agenda. Unlike his home secretary Priti Patel, who has a natural flair for the language of constraint and cruelty, Johnson craves approval, and is at heart a libertarian. He has built a political persona whose one consistency is bumbling, tousle-haired frivolity. It’s possible that he doesn’t have the requisite ruthlessness in him. Though it is more likely, I think, that this is just a lack of competence and foresight. By no means is this a call to complacency: this government isn’t over until it’s over, and the urgency of resisting these encroachments to democracy hasn’t in any way abated. Yet the fight against them looks more winnable every day. Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion,Johnson likes to dress up as a mini-dictator.

2/3/2022,"An American pizza chain has started paying its customers to not get their pizzas delivered to them, as a result of a national labor shortage. Instead, Domino’s will effectively pay them to pick up the food themselves. In a statement Domino’s has announced that it will start tipping its customers $3 that can be used towards their next order if they pick up their pizzas from the stores.  “It takes skill to get pizza from a Domino’s store to your door,” said Art D’Elia, Domino’s executive president and chief marketing officer. “As a reward, Domino’s is giving a $3 tip to online carryout customers who take the time and energy out of their day to act as their own delivery drivers. After all, we think they deserve it.” The $3 coupon code can be claimed by carryout customers who order online between now and 22 May 2022. Customers can then apply the code to an online carryout order placed the following week with a minimum purchase of $5 before tax and gratuity. “Domino’s carryout tips come just in time for the biggest football game of the year, which is also one of the busiest days of the year for pizza,” said D’Elia, referring to the Super Bowl which will take place in three weeks. In recent months, Domino’s earnings have taken a hit as a result of the pandemic and fewer workers. The pizza company’s same store sales in the US declined by 1.9% in the third quarter of 2021, marking the company’s first decline in a decade. CEO Richard Allison attributed the shrinking sales to the nationwide worker shortage, which has largely led to insufficient delivery drivers for the company. The US is currently facing record resignations in its labor force, with 4.4 million workers or 3% of the country’s total workforce quitting in September 2021. Two industries – accommodation and food services – have experienced the highest quit rates as a result of low pay and poor working conditions across the board. Because Domino’s does not use third-party delivery services such as Uber Eats or DoorDash, “staffing has been a challenge”, according to Allison. Additionally, according to Domino’s corporate controller and treasurer, Jessica Parrish, the worker shortage has led to challenges in the company’s customer service division and has reduced operating hours, leading to fewer order counts. Allison also said that the company plans to deal with “unexpected increases” in food prices, as the cost of ingredients increase from 8% to 10% compared to the previous year. “We expected unprecedented increases in our food basket cost versus 2021 of 8-10%, which is three to four times what we would normally see in a year,” Allison said. “I think many of you are aware of the significant inflation across the US economy and how that is hitting many of the inputs that we have for our business from meats to cheese to some of the grains that go into the production of our products,” he added. In another cost-saving move, Domino’s has reduced the amount of chicken wings it offers to customers, cutting the number from 10 pieces to eight.",News/Business,Keep the change: Domino’s offers $3 tips if you pick up your pizza yourself,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/03/dominos-pizza-offers-customers-tips-pick-up-own-pizza
2/3/2022,"His lorry loaded with British Airways aircraft parts, Ivo Hradilik was expecting to drive onto a ferry headed to Calais, before delivering his cargo to the outskirts of Paris. But there’s a problem with the customs paperwork, and the 26-year-old HGV driver from the Czech Republic will have to park up near the Port of Dover while the haulage company sorts everything out.  “From the new year it has got worse with the paperwork,” Hradilik said, clutching a handful of documents. He usually visits Dover five times a month bringing goods between Britain and the EU. Hradilik expects to wait for hours before setting sail. On Wednesday, long queues of lorries built up once again on the approach roads to Dover, with as many as 100 vehicles waiting on the A20. The sheer volume of HGVs meant the town’s emergency traffic management system was activated twice on Wednesday, once at 5am and again at midday. Known as TAP – Operation Travel Access Protocol – it can be triggered by a request from the port authority or the police to the National Highways agency. Lorries heading for the port are required to stay in the left-hand lane of the A20 dual carriageway. Then small groups are called forward by a police officer stationed at the Aycliffe roundabout, once space becomes available at the port for them to enter the terminal. According to National Highways, TAP has been activated 20 times so far this year, compared with 69 times for the whole of 2021. The Port of Dover says the main cause is a spike in freight traffic, rather than Brexit. The drivers see things differently. Many blame the introduction on 1 January of the first controls on imports from the EU, and a new UK government IT system for goods entering and leaving the country. “Since 1 January, I have queued every time in Dover,” Hradilik said. “From Calais it is better – there is only about two hours waiting.” Time spent queueing in his cab is time that goes unpaid. Under Hradilik’s contract, he gets paid per kilometre driven, rather than time spent on the road. When out of their vehicles, HGV drivers are easy to spot in Dover – they walk around holding sheaves of paperwork. Ciaran Donovan, a driver based in the UK who regularly travels back and forth to the continent, said the holdups were due to the extra time needed by staff to check the forms. He is unable to charge his customers more for extended journey times – including the hours spent queueing to reach the port – as he fears they will find another firm to carry their goods. “Having to sit there in the queues for free in order to earn money is soul-destroying,” Donovan said. Donovan has also been caught out on the other side of the Channel when returning to the UK. Last Friday, he was stuck in Calais for 16 hours because he hadn’t received the paperwork required to enter the UK. “I think the customs agents can’t cope. They’ve got too much work,” he said. Snaking up the A20 on Wednesday, the vehicles were from a host of countries including Ireland, Germany, Poland, Lithuania and Serbia. A spokesperson for the Port of Dover said the new EU import controls were partly to blame. But the main cause, they said, was a 25% increase in freight traffic in January compared with a year earlier, combined with roadworks and ferries being out of service. “In conjunction with having to manage such increased freight volumes, 25% of the ferry fleet has been away on normal annual refit and there are external highway works impacting the port’s holding capacity.” One of the 12 ferries that serve Dover has recently returned, but two are still out of service. Freight traffic usually begins to climb in mid-January, following the Christmas break, but the long tailbacks seen so far this year have taken many drivers who regularly travel to Dover by surprise. Some point to teething problems for users of a new IT platform – the goods vehicle movement system (GVMS), required when moving cargo into or out of Great Britain and Northern Ireland – which launched on 1 January. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), which is responsible for the new portal, admitted it was not available to users for 15 minutes on Monday 31 January, when there was a system outage. An HMRC spokesperson said: “The goods vehicle movement system (GVMS) and other customs systems are online and working as planned. Traders and hauliers are adapting very well to the new processes.” This will come as scant consolation for Fernando Naranjo Sanchez, a driver from Seville in Spain, who said he had regularly queued for several hours to reach the port in January. The 35-year-old visits Dover two or three times each month, bringing clothing manufactured in Morocco to the UK. “Two Mondays ago I was waiting on the A20 for seven and a half hours,” he said. “It is worse than it used to be. There is more paperwork.” Meanwhile, Vitalii Shulha, a driver from Ukraine, said he had been stuck in an eight-hour queue to reach the port in the final week of January. Haulage firms warn of further hurdles on the horizon, when physical controls on the import of EU products of animal and plant origin, which have been delayed several times by the UK government, are implemented in July. For many drivers, haulage firms and customs agents the queues and complications are a new reality, additional frictions that will be a continuing feature of post-Brexit trade.",News/Business,‘It is soul-destroying’: lorry drivers face hours stuck in queues at Dover,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/03/it-is-soul-destroying-lorry-drivers-face-hours-stuck-in-queues-at-dover
2/3/2022,"The government is failing to cut greenhouse gas emissions from heating the UK’s homes, an influential committee of MPs has warned, with little sign of a clear plan for ending reliance on increasingly expensive gas. Home heating is responsible for about 14% of the UK’s carbon emissions, and must be tackled urgently if the government is to meet its carbon reduction targets. Last year, ministers announced a heat and buildings strategy, with the intention of weaning the UK away from gas – which makes up about 80% of domestic heating – and on to lower carbon alternatives, such as heat pumps.  But the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) select committee found that the strategy did not set out how the changes would be achieved, that government “lacked clear direction” on the issue, and that current policies were inadequate to the scale of the problem. The warning comes amid soaring gas prices around the world, which are also likely to result in a sharp rise in the energy price cap, to be announced on Thursday, and expected to hit lower income households hardest. The government is considering measures to reduce the impact of the price rises. Some Tory MPs and commentators have blamed investments in renewable energy and the net zero target for price rises, but analysts have made it clear that renewable energy has brought down energy costs in the UK and over-reliance on gas is behind the rises. Jan Rosenow, a director at the Regulatory Assistance Project, who advised the committee, told the Guardian: “Shifting away from fossil fuels is the only real solution to the energy price rises. The alternative is to keep using fossil fuels, and then we will see this again and again.” The BEIS committee report underlined that the government must communicate clearly to households that decarbonising heating and reaching net zero emissions should result in a net saving for households, and protect them from volatile gas prices. But the MPs said the government had not yet done enough to make this clear, and to make the transition easy for people on low and middle incomes. Darren Jones, chair of the cross-party committee, warned: “Replacing gas boilers is a huge task and we are not making anywhere near enough progress … Bill payers today are deeply worried about their energy costs, with many people struggling to afford to heat their homes.” He added: “Most people don’t realise that their gas boiler will need to be replaced within the next ten to 15 years. The government and energy companies should explain to bill payers why switching away from gas and insulating our homes is not only important in tackling climate change, but also a route to reducing energy bills. The government also needs to spell out what financial help will be put in place for those who need it most.” Ministers have a target of installing 600,000 heat pumps a year by 2028, up from only a few thousand today, but the committee said it was not clear how this could be met with current policies, including a £5,000 grant for installing heat pumps. The green homes grant, the short-lived scheme to insulate homes and install heat pumps, was abandoned last year after botched administration, and has not been replaced. The Treasury is also reported to want to scrap the Energy Company Obligation, a £1bn a year levy on energy companies, paid for through additions to energy bills, that funds the installation of insulation and other low-carbon measures for lower income households. Green campaigners say scrapping ECO would be counter-productive. Jones said the government must urgently come up with a replacement for the green homes grant. “Ministers can’t simply leave this to the market – government should tackle the cost of heating our homes in the round, and bring forward joined-up policies that address these issues together,” he said. Recent research showed that energy efficiency measures over the last two decades have saved UK households about £1,000 a year on current energy bills. But much of the saving came from regulations meaning only the most efficient gas boilers could be sold, and future cost savings and carbon reductions must come from replacing gas with alternatives such as heat pumps, electricity and district heating, as well as insulating Britain’s draughty housing stock. Juliet Phillips, campaign coordinator at the Electrify Heat campaign, said: “Heat pumps are the way to go for clean, safe and efficient heat – but there remains much work to be done to turn government ambition into delivery on the ground. This means building a skilled workforce who can install and maintain heat pumps across the country; widespread public engagement and provision of trusted advice to support households to make the switch; and boosting affordability through removing legacy policy costs from electricity bills, which currently unfairly penalise electricity use compared to gas.” Laura Bishop, chair of the Ground Source Heat Pump Association, an industry body, said: “Without heat pumps and other low-carbon heating systems, the UK’s net zero ambitions will be hard to achieve. Heat pumps are suitable for the majority of homes in the UK.” The committee also called for measures including help for households to access finance to install low-carbon heating, including grants for those most vulnerable, and for investment in the training of engineers and installers, in cooperation with the UK’s heating and construction industries.

2/3/2022,"Several years ago, a series of serendipitous events led me to temporarily swap houses with a stranger. The fortuitous exchange would introduce me to an area of Paris I had never previously heard of, and one that I would subsequently revisit numerous times. Compact enough to explore on foot but large enough to regularly reveal new treasures, its unrefined charms, the eclectic array of local residents and, perhaps most prominently, the range of delicious and affordable food to be found all captivated me. Straddling four arrondissements, Belleville has a rich history steeped in working-class rebellion. Its former residents were among the staunchest supporters of the Paris Commune, and when the Versailles army came to reconquer Paris in 1871, they faced some of the fiercest resistance from this vibrant quartier.  The neighbourhood’s more recent battle is a modern one: the struggle against creeping gentrification. Though it has largely managed to withstand the sweeping changes felt in the neighbouring 18th arrondissement, plans to add a further six stations to the Métro line on which Belleville lies, combined with preparations for the 2024 Paris Olympics, are likely to accelerate the process. Belleville has long been a gathering place for immigrants. Armenian, Greek and Polish communities came and settled prior to the second world war. Sephardic Jews from Tunisia and Algeria soon followed. In the 1970s, Chinese and Vietnamese migrants arrived, and now cohabit with diverse communities from north and west Africa. Little more than a century ago, it was considered a particularly “Parisian” part of Paris, with more than half of its residents born in the area. Now, more than a third of its inhabitants come from outside Metropolitan France. This vibrant mix makes for one of the most interesting places to eat in the capital. The diversity of the district’s inhabitants is evident in the shops that line Boulevard de Belleville. Shelves are stacked high with edible delights from across the globe. Lamb heads replete with teeth turn beneath rotisserie chickens outside halal butcher shops. Store fronts groan with boxes of Chinese cabbage, cassava, okra, yams, plantains and a multitude of chillies. As home to the city’s second Chinatown, Belleville has countless eating options. Among the most authentic is La Tour de Belleville on Rue de la Présentation. The star of the show at this inauspicious canteen is undoubtably the soup. Lamian wheat noodles are expertly stretched to order in cat’s cradle fashion, before being swiftly blanched and added to a long-simmered aromatic broth, redolent with ginger and star anise, and adorned with meltingly tender beef, duck or pork. Amid a smattering of trendy newcomers on the 20th-arrondissement side of the boulevard sits a clutch of restaurants and cafes catering to the Tunisian Jewish community. Longstanding institution Chez René et Gabin attracts a loyal following, particularly on Fridays, when a brisk takeaway trade takes place in preparation for Shabbat. The menu features familiar Sephardic staples such as shakshouka (spiced eggs and peppers poached in tomato sauce), sitting alongside lesser-known daily specials like mloukhia, a vivid green herbaceous casserole of braised beef, and akoud, a slow-simmered and subtly spiced tripe stew. Although the signature casse croûte, a traditional Tunisian sandwich, is a bestseller for good reason, an arguably better version can be found on the other side of the street. The ever-present queue at Di-napoli is testament to the perennial popularity of this hole-in-the-wall, home to one of this notoriously expensive city’s culinary bargains. The small team operates tirelessly behind the tiny counter, churning out a relentless stream of orders, filling sandwiches abundantly with tuna, or minced beef with a mechouia, a tomato and pepper paste, and making fine omelettes on the cast-iron hotplate with a scarlet dollop of fiery harissa. A little further towards Ménilmontant lies the bright yellow facade of Spécialités Antillaises. While Covid has temporarily curtailed the attached restaurant, the shop does a thriving trade in ready-made dishes from the French Caribbean, with large queues lining up to receive special orders of stuffed sucking pig, creole-glazed ham and lobster fricassee, alongside other items unique to the islands. Midway up Rue de Belleville sits a community stalwart that has been in operation for more than 30 years. The perpetually packed dining room of Lao Siam accommodates an eclectic crowd of devotees.It stands out among a slew of fairly forgettable Thai restaurants by steadfastly sticking to the family’s roots, offering a selection of hard-to-find northeastern Thai and Laotian dishes, such as nem thadeua, a grilled rice salad with fermented pork, home-made sai oua, a spicy sausage flecked with turmeric, lemongrass, chilli and kaffir lime leaf. So far, Belleville’s defiant disposition remains – for how much longer it is hard to say. The collective community view seems to be that, no matter how many natural wine and organic grocers move in, the strong spirit of multiculturalism will endure. This pocket of Paris retains its allure partly because it is bereft of the mass tourism that characterises the more popular parts of the city. A far cry from the incredulous assertion made by Fox News that the neighbourhood was a “no-go zone”, it continuously reveals its diverse charms. At the benches outside Moncoeur Belleville, beers are sipped as the sun dips. Local kids kick footballs, the Eiffel Tower visible in the distance past Parc de Belleville. Women in traditional west African dress sell foil-wrapped pastels (doughnuts) from a bench for a few euros. Definitely Paris, but for now still defiantly Belleville.",Lifestyle/Travel,Defiantly Belleville: a foodie trip to Paris’s multicultural heart,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/feb/03/defiantly-belleville-a-foodie-trip-to-pariss-multicultural-heart
2/3/2022,"Dylan Thomas’s grave is an extravagantly simple affair. He’s buried in the overspill graveyard at St Martin’s church in Laugharne on the Carmarthenshire coast. There’s no gravestone, just a white wooden cross with his name on one side and, on the other, that of his wife, Caitlin, who lies there with him. I don’t recall seeing a humbler resting place for any such celebrated person. I wonder if the man who famously raged against the dying of the light would be so enraged about his light dying that he would like his grave this way, having something so basic in which he could sulk for eternity. Rightly or wrongly, the simplicity of it suggested humility; the man went up in my estimation.  If you take the muddy track from the top of that graveyard towards the sea, you soon come across something rather grander bearing his name. The Dylan Coastal Resort is an upmarket development of “luxury self-catering properties with hot tubs, world-class spa and dining facilities”. It all looked very nice indeed, but the name felt terribly wrong. Perhaps it was coming across it moments after seeing that same name etched on to a simple wooden cross. For me the sight was a visual representation of the sound of nails screeching down a blackboard. I have since established that a week in May in one of the very nice Milk Wood Lodges would set me back more than £2,500. I imagine folk in those Milk Wood Lodges reading Under Milk Wood while the ghost of Dylan rages away at the dissonance of it all.

2/3/2022,"When fighting erupted in May between pro-democracy armed groups and the military in Demoso township in Myanmar’s Karenni state (also known as Kayah), Khu Bue Reh* had to leave his village with his wife and five-year-old son. They hid in the dense forest, their only shelter a tarpaulin, surviving on what little food they had carried with them.  Two months after they left, Khu Bue Reh’s son, who had previously suffered from seizures, suddenly lost the ability to speak, sit up or eat solid food. In February 2021, Myanmar's progress towards democracy was brutally stalled when the military seized power and took control of the country.   In the year since, the country has been plunged into violence, poverty and mass displacement as the military attempts to crush widespread resistance to its rule.  Internet blackouts, arbitrary arrests, a ruthless curtailing of freedom of speech and escalating military attacks on civilian areas have silenced the voices of people from Myanmar.   For this special series, the Guardian’s Rights and freedom project has partnered with a diverse group of journalists from Myanmar, many working in secret, to bring their reporting on life under military rule to a global audience. Journalists in Myanmar are working in dangerous and difficult circumstances, as the military government attacks the free press and shuts down local media outlets. Many reporters still inside the country fear arrest, with others forced to leave their homes and go into hiding in areas increasingly under attack from military forces.  All the reporting in this series will be carried out by journalists from Myanmar, with support from the editors on the Rights and freedom project. These are the stories that journalists from Myanmar want to tell about what is happening to their country at this critical moment. With no one to turn to in the forest, the family embarked on a desperate journey through a heavily militarised area to take their son to a doctor in the state capital, Loikaw. Months later, with their son in hospital, they became trapped as the city came under a barrage of airstrikes and artillery fire. Khu Bue Reh’s family are just one among hundreds of thousands who are bearing the brunt of the rapidly growing humanitarian crisis across Myanmar. In response to rising armed resistance to its power, the military has targeted entire civilian populations with airstrikes, artillery shelling, arson and indiscriminate gunfire. More than 300,000 people across the country have become displaced since the coup, forced to abandon their homes and their livelihoods. Before the coup, Karenni, located on Myanmar’s south-eastern border with Thailand, had not seen active conflict over the past decade. Now it has become one of the country’s strongest new fronts of resistance. The military’s relentless attacks have displaced about 150,000 people across the state, or roughly half of its population, according to the Karenni Human Rights Group. Most of the displaced people are sheltering in mountainous and forested areas where they have extremely limited access to basic necessities. Civilians seeking to return to their village to fetch food and other supplies have been killed by the military. The military has also blocked lifesaving aid to displaced populations across the country and attacked humanitarian workers, leaving displaced people desperate for basic food, shelter and healthcare. The humanitarian and security situation in Karenni continues to deteriorate. On Christmas Eve in Hpruso township, the military massacred at least 35 civilians, including women, children and aid workers, and burned them in their vehicles. Fighting between the military and armed resistance groups has intensified since then, causing further displacement. In the last week of January, the bodies of six civilians, including women and children, were found in two villages near Loikaw; some showed signs of torture, according to a Radio Free Asia report. The Guardian spoke to displaced people and volunteer nurses in Demoso in the last week of December. They say that medical care is only available for minor illnesses and there are shortages of medicine. “We are falling sick,” says one displaced person, “but we cannot visit a clinic.” In Loikaw, Khu Bue Reh’s son spent more than a month in the hospital after doctors found he had suffered a stroke. He has since been readmitted several times, leaving the family with more than 1,500,000 kyats (£630) in medical bills. These costs create a huge financial burden for him and his wife, who are rice farmers. Although they managed to plant their crop, they could not harvest it during the fighting. “I spent all my savings, and I still need to buy medicine and nutritious drinks for my son,” Khu Bue Reh told the Guardian in early January from Loikaw. “I cannot go home.” On 15 January, the 500-bed hospital where the family’s son was being treated was shut down and all the patients evacuated. Health workers told a local news site, the Kantarawaddy Times, that the fighting and the electricity blackouts in Loikaw had left the hospital unable to continue operating. Khu Bue Reh and his family are further from home than ever. He says his son has been relocated to a hospital 150 km north, in Shan state; he and his wife are now living in a displacement camp nearby. *Name has been changed to protect his identity Khu Peh Bue is the news editor of the Kantarawaddy Times, a Karenni state-based news media outlet.
