2/1/2022,"Tesco is closing its Jack’s discount chain, created to win back shoppers from Aldi and Lidl, less than four years after it was launched. Britain’s biggest grocer opened the first Jack’s stores – named after the supermarket’s founder, Jack Cohen – in September 2018, in Chatteris in Cambridgeshire and Immingham in Lincolnshire, with a promise to be “the cheapest in town”.  It had ambitious expansion plans for the chain, and had initially set out to open between 10 and 15 stores in the first six months after launch. But Tesco ultimately opened just 13 Jack’s stores. Six of the branches will be converted into Tesco superstores, while the remaining seven will be shut permanently. About 130 jobs are to go at the closing stores and at the retailer’s head office, although Tesco said it would try to find alternative roles for the staff affected. Jack’s employees at the shops being converted will automatically be offered new in-store roles, while Tesco said it would also be recruiting extra staff for the new superstores. Tesco insisted the Jack’s venture had helped it to win over new customers from its competitors. Jason Tarry, the chief executive of Tesco UK and Ireland, said: “We have learnt a huge amount from Jack’s and this has helped Tesco become more competitive, more efficient and strengthened our value proposition, including through the launch of Aldi price match.” Jack’s was created during the tenure of Tesco’s former chief executive, Dave Lewis, and launched in the company’s centenary year. The retailer claimed it had spotted a gap in the market for shoppers who wanted “smaller, simpler” stores that sold more British produce. To keep costs down, Jack’s stores followed a similar layout to stores run by the German discounters, with products stacked on pallets on the floor rather than on shelves, while they also promised discounted homewares. Almost three-quarters (70%) of the products sold in the stores were branded as Jack’s, while the branches stocked a greatly reduced range, with about 10% of the items found in a typical large Tesco supermarket. Jack’s branded products will remain available at independent convenience stores that are supplied by wholesaler Booker, which is now owned by Tesco. After a review of the meat, fish and hot deli counters in its stores, Tesco said it was closing those counters at 317 shops where there was the least demand. The employees working on the counters will be offered alternative roles. In January, Tesco was revealed as one of the winners of the most recent Christmas trading battle, according to analysis by data firm Kantar, increasing its market share to almost 28% during the festive period.",News/Business,Tesco to close Jack’s discount chain of shops,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/31/tesco-to-close-jacks-discount-chain
2/1/2022,"The interim findings of a report by the civil servant Sue Gray are damning of the culture at the heart of Boris Johnson’s government. Ms Gray cited “failures of leadership and judgment”; “excessive” consumption of alcohol in the workplace; and officials cowed into silence about Covid rule-breaking in Downing Street. Ms Gray said she has been “extremely limited” by a police investigation and was unable to make firm conclusions about what she had discovered. However, Ms Gray’s report suggests that some of the events she examined didn’t comply with lockdown rules, saying that “a number of these gatherings should not have been allowed to take place or to develop in the way that they did”. Reading this, it’s hard to believe that the people who made the law had obeyed the law. Mr Johnson’s argument to MPs had been that the Downing Street parties were not parties because lockdown guidance had been heeded. The Johnson logic was that since the rules said there could be no party, whatever happened wasn’t a party. The trouble with this reasoning is that Ms Gray has amassed enough evidence for the police to investigate a dozen potential criminal breaches of Covid rules in Mr Johnson’s home and office. The Met has 300 photographs and 500 pieces of paper from Ms Gray, which only raise the stakes for Tory MPs. This feels more like the vapour trail from a cruise missile than the wispy smoke coming off a warm gun.  To defend himself, the prime minister gave a perfunctory apology before playing the rousing orator. This performance ought to have fooled no one apart from loyalists who have been rehashing a repertoire of absurdities in Mr Johnson’s cause. The evidence points to the prime minister being at a party in his own garden when such gatherings were banned and when voters did not see their parents for months. One of Mr Johnson’s backbenchers asked him in parliament if he “took us all for fools”. The prime minister was reduced to shameful smears of Sir Keir Starmer, who had called for Mr Johnson to resign. The Labour leader gave perhaps his most effective Commons performance, with a speech laced with words that struck home because they were true. Mr Johnson, said Sir Keir, is a man without shame, whose response in a crisis is to blame everyone but himself. What will happen to Mr Johnson will depend not on Ms Gray’s indictment, but on pure politics. The prime minister’s imperviousness to the opinions of others and to facts that didn’t suit him will have devastating consequences on trust in good government. Mr Johnson’s fate is in the hands of Tory MPs, which is presumably why he cancelled a call with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in favour of a meeting with his backbenchers. This scramble to keep his job also saw Mr Johnson take ownership of unpopular tax rises at the weekend, a price presumably extracted by his ambitious chancellor, Rishi Sunak. Those who can bring Mr Johnson down in the Tory party are those who pulled him up into Downing Street – despite what that meant for the country. Mr Johnson no doubt hopes to play on Tory fears about the loss of power. His contention has long been that his political ascent proved that a lack of policy detail and probity are irrelevant compared with the electoral attraction of his showmanship. If Tory MPs choose to keep Mr Johnson after this debacle, then they will have shown to have had no regard for standards in public life or integrity in parliament. That would be bad for Britain, but would tell the country as much about the modern Conservative party as it says about the prime minister.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Boris Johnson: a PM without shame | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/31/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnson-a-pm-without-shame
2/1/2022,"Terry Galloway and his siblings grew up in care. His sister had a difficult life, which ended when she was murdered by a partner. As children, the Galloways made a pact to try to improve the care system, which is part of the reason why he will travel to Downing Street as part of a delegation of care leavers on Tuesday. Their petition objects to a new law that, because it took the form of secondary legislation, has so far failed to generate the national outcry that it merits. That law makes official in England the practice of forcing children out of care at the age of 16. Between 2018 and 2020, while living in this type of setting, 22 children aged 16 and 17 died. The government won’t say which councils were responsible for these children, but a review following the death of Caitlin Sharp criticised Worcestershire social services, and said that she should not have been living independently, partly due to her epilepsy. Forcing children to manage life on their own leads to other forms of harm too. Last year, the Together Trust found that 3,253 16- and 17-year-olds were not in education, employment or training while living in non-care settings. More recently, Ofsted published research showing that more than a third of care leavers don’t know where to turn in an emergency, and that money worries make many feel unsafe.  The Children Act of 1989 allowed for unspecified “other arrangements” to take the place of foster or children’s homes in some cases. But the increase in such arrangements is unprecedented: in the decade from 2010 to 2020, the number of non-care placements rose 89%. It was evidence of the damage this was causing, including the exploitation of children by criminal gangs, that forced ministers to tighten the rules. But while a small number of under-16s stand to benefit from new regulations, a much larger group of older teenagers face their lack of entitlement being made a permanent feature of the English care system. While Ofsted will have oversight of unregulated accommodation providers, individual properties will not be inspected. Young people will be expected to take full responsibility for their finances and medical care, and will not need permission to stay out overnight – all while doing their GCSEs. It is hard to know whether to be more shocked by these details or the muted reaction to them. A small charity, Article 39, is taking the government to court, but the silence from the rest of the children’s sector, wider civil society, the Labour frontbench and the House of Lords is eerie. Do all these adults agree with ministers that 16-year-olds don’t need to be “looked-after children” any more? Increasing the school-leaving age has long been regarded as a badge of progress – proof of a society’s commitment to the next generation. The care-leaving age may lack the same universal significance. But the principle, as well as the practical folly, of trying to make some of the most vulnerable young people in society independent before they are even fully grown should bother us all. Withdrawing care from teenagers deliberately shortens their childhoods.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the care-leaving age: teenagers are children too | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/31/the-guardian-view-on-the-care-leaving-age-teenagers-are-children-too

2/1/2022," In any normal political climate, the Sue Gray report should be a final word. It is not short on statements that should condemn the prime minister, confirming the facts that have been out in the public domain for weeks now. Twelve parties – all but four of those that took place – are under criminal investigation. One of those, and this is not a passing detail, took place in the prime minister’s own flat. While the rest of the country was negotiating the fine technicalities of what constitutes a breach of the rules, in some instances pondering whether to sit on a bench in the park or not, these parties seem to suggest that No 10 and civil service staff, under the eye of the prime minister, believed they were exempt. But this is not a normal political climate. It is one where Johnson and the Conservative party, even with their popularity severely diminished, have a large majority, no clear successor, and a grace period before the next election: if reports and conclusions can be spaced out far enough, and with fatigue and a heave-ho from the rightwing press, all this can be drowned by time. There is potentially enough in the Gray report already to help the government along in this effort. There is enough bureaucrat speak, enough legally prompted restraint, for Johnson and his supporters to hang it all on the “infrastructure” of No 10, the proximity of the garden to the offices, the “fragmented leadership structures” that “blur” lines of accountability. There might be enough here for Johnson to say, as he has done, picking up on the lifelines immediately: “I get it and I will fix it.” That pledge sounds more like a wink than an earnest promise. Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist In her report, Sue Gray stated that, “At times it seems there was too little thought given to what was happening across the country.” As one of the 3.7 million clinically vulnerable people who were shielding 24/7 at home as Boris Johnson and his team let off steam, I can only agree. Every report of a party during lockdown is an insult to disabled people who even now are still afraid to have a drink with a friend. How did we get to this point as a country? The attributes that could have led the prime minister and those around him to potentially break the law – entitlement, carelessness, deceitfulness – have long been visible to those who cared to see them. As Johnson shamelessly tries to cling on to power, attention should also turn to those who helped get him there. The Tory MPs who are now moving against Johnson allowed party members to choose between him and Jeremy Hunt as leader when it suited them, just as the rightwing press now crying foul helped him get the keys to No 10 in the first place. The consequences of this will be felt for years to come. The greatest loss from Johnson’s time in office is the thousands of lives unnecessarily taken by coronavirus, but we should not underestimate the loss of public trust, too. Democracies are sustained by leaders with integrity, just as they are damaged by those without. The hangover from “partygate” will linger in Britain long after Gray’s sparse report gathers dust. For a man famously fascinated by great leaders and power, Johnson will indeed go down in the history books – as the prime minister who partied as his citizens died. Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist and author of Crippled: Austerity and the Demonisation of Disabled People It is simply a tragedy of history that when the Covid-19 crisis hit, Boris Johnson was prime minister of the UK. The scientific research from British academic institutions – and the NHS – is superb. We are envied by much of the world. Yet the UK response to Covid in 2020 was abysmal, as reflected by the death toll of 176,000. In March 2020, there was no preparation, no plan and no leadership. Johnson missed five consecutive emergency meetings about Covid in the buildup to the crisis; boasted that he had shaken hands with Covid patients; went into hospitals without wearing a mask; and allegedly said (when pushed to introduce restrictions to slow the spread of the virus), “let the bodies pile high”. The Gray report tells us little that we did not already know about Johnson’s poor leadership at this time. This is a report about the parties at No 10, but really it is not about parties at all. It is about the sacrifices – financial, social, familial – that normal people made to protect their communities and be law-abiding citizens, while the government carried on with seemingly little interest or care for the people of their country. Covid will not be the last pandemic we face – and there is a real chance that another variant like Omicron could be just around the corner, and it could be much more dangerous. From a public health perspective, we need people to look out for each other because it’s the right thing to do. Because they care about the lives and livelihoods of others. This starts with modelling of appropriate behaviour and leadership from the top. Johnson has lost the trust of the people of this country. The consequence is that we are all more exposed and weaker in our pandemic response. Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh Over the weekend, there had been a sense building among Boris Johnson’s allies that the prime minister was over the worst of it when it came to “partygate”. The rebels had lost momentum and the work of Johnson loyalists was beginning to result in more Tory MPs speaking up on behalf of the PM. Even the police getting involved was seen by some as having an upside. The thinking was that it would drag things out, Johnson could remove anyone who was fined by the police from No 10 – and then declare, when the Gray report finally came out, that he had dealt with matters. But Gray’s update, in which she was more than keen to stress this was not her report and just a summary, and Johnson’s response to it, has put him back in the danger zone. First, there’s the sheer number of events the police are looking at. Second, there is the fact the PM was at some of them – and they include a gathering at his Downing Street flat. Finally, there was the prime minister’s appearance in the Commons. When he needed to be statesmanlike and contrite, he was angry and combative – even refusing to commit to publishing the full report once the police investigation was concluded (a position Downing Street has already had to U-turn on). His attack on Keir Starmer for the failure to prosecute Jimmy Savile (a claim that has been disproven) dismayed even his own MPs – while his questioning of drug use by the Labour frontbench was viewed as simply bizarre. “It was terrible,” says one member of the payroll. The scale of Tory anger at Johnson was on full display, as MPs – from Theresa May to the 2019 intake – lined up to criticise him. Given that many of the MPs who spoke up in the chamber aren’t exactly known for being Johnson loyalists, there was no single intervention that signals a collapse in support for the PM. However, behind the scenes, discomfort is building. Johnson’s response to the report has only added to doubts about his future. For all the talk from Johnson of change in how No 10 operates, the part that most worries MPs is that he may not realise that he needs to change, too.

2/1/2022,"The Kentucky Republican congressman Thomas Massie was under familiar fire on Monday, after criticising Anthony Fauci with a quote attributed to Voltaire but actually coined by a white supremacist convicted on charges related to child abuse images. “To learn who rules over you,” the quote says, “simply find out who you are not allowed to criticise.”  Massie posted it to Twitter on Sunday, saying: “You mustn’t question Fauci, for he is science.” Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser is the target of rightwing criticism and death threats, for his role in the US government response to Covid-19. Massie is an energetic rightwing gadfly who last month issued a Christmas card image in which he and his family toted assault rifles. Speaking to the Guardian then, Elaine Kamarck, a former official in the Clinton administration, said: “The guy’s abominable but that’s what’s happening to the Republican party. They’re flat-out nuts. There’s a piece of the Republican party that now supports violence.” Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: “We’re into the kind of outrage culture in the Republican party. There’s almost a competition as to who can be more outrageous, more vicious and threatening. It’s a race to the bottom.” Massie is not the first person to apparently be fooled by the supposed quote from the French philosopher Voltaire. In 2019, the actor John Cusack used it in a tweet for which he apologised after being accused of antisemitism. The neo-Nazi who coined the quote, Kevin Strom, is described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as “arguably the only true intellectual remaining in the American neo-Nazi movement … a bookish yet dogmatic neo-Nazi”. He has said attributions of his quote to Voltaire are “kind of flattering”. His conviction for possessing child abuse images came in 2008 and resulted in a sentence to 23 months in prison. Massie’s use of Strom’s quote to attack Fauci attracted widespread anger. The writer Thomas Ricks, for example, wrote: “Nah. The essence of science is asking questions. But you also must listen to the answers.” By Monday afternoon, Massie had not commented on Twitter or taken his post down.

2/1/2022,"A City banker who had a witch’s hat left on her desk by drunken male colleagues has won more than £2m in compensation for sexual discrimination. Stacey Macken, 50, sued French bank BNP Paribas after being belittled by her boss who kept telling her “not now, Stacey” – a phrase he used so often that colleagues even copied it.  The £120k-a-year finance specialist claimed that over a four-year period she received hundreds of thousands of pounds less than her male peers in salary and bonuses and that after she complained, managers targeted her with unfair treatment. Macken won £2,081,449 after suing the international bank, reportedly one of the largest awards ever made by a British tribunal. The employment judge, Emma Burns, criticised Macken’s bosses for acting “spitefully and vindictively” and increased her compensation because the bank failed to apologise to her. The London Central tribunal heard that Macken, previously a vice-president at Deutsche Bank, was hired by BNP in Paribas in 2013. But unknown to her, a man hired with the same job title and responsibilities was being paid £160,000. Within months of joining, she claimed she was exposed to sexist behaviour involving one of her bosses in the prime brokerage team, Matt Pinnock. His former PA, Georgina Chapman, told a tribunal: “In October 2013, a large Halloween-style black witch’s hat was left on Stacey Macken’s desk after some of the prime brokerage team, including Matthew Pinnock, had gone drinking at the pub towards the end of the day.” She added: “Stacey was visibly upset and confided in me that she felt really uncomfortable working with those male colleagues, knowing that one of them had purposefully gone out of their way to leave a witch’s hat on her desk.” Another boss, Denis Pihan, was accused of routinely demeaning her by replying “not now, Stacey” when she tried to talk to him. Macken, from Fulham, in west London, was successful in her claims of sex discrimination, victimisation, and unequal pay. The tribunal ruled the leaving of a witch’s hat on her desk was an “inherently sexist act” and the regular use of “not now, Stacey” was branded a “demeaning comment”. At Macken’s compensation hearing, Judge Burns said: “We consider the tribunal panel found that Mr Pinnock and Mr Pihan behaved spitefully and vindictively towards Miss Macken because she had raised concerns about her pay and that they did have a discriminatory motive. “We consider the [bank] should apologise more fully from a purely moral perspective, but we decline from ordering it to do this. “In our judgment, for an apology to be effective it needs to be genuine and heartfelt rather than ordered … We have taken into account the bank’s failure to apologise when awarding aggravated damages. We consider this is the correct approach in this case.” Pihan “apologised for causing distress” at the tribunal but “did not acknowledge that he personally discriminated against Miss Macken, nor did he apologise for discriminating against her”. The bank claimed it has now adopted a “detailed gender strategy and gender action plan” in response to its poor gender pay gap and is “trying to increase the number of women at senior management level”. Macken, who said her ordeal had an impact on her mental health, is also a qualified accountant who was raised and educated in New Zealand. A tribunal report said of her: “She has prioritised her 22-year career in banking over other lifestyle choices. This includes remaining single and not having children. “She enjoyed her work and was fulfilled by it. Other than keeping her personal fitness at a high level she pursued no other hobbies or interests.”",Lifestyle/Money,Banker wins £2m for sexual discrimination in ‘witch hat’ case,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/31/banker-wins-2m-for-sexual-discrimination-in-witch-hat-case
2/1/2022,"The New York judge overseeing Virginia Giuffre’s sexual abuse case against Britain’s Prince Andrew has officially requested assistance from British and Australian legal authorities in obtaining testimony from potential witnesses outside the US. Judge Lewis Kaplan’s formal request stems from petitions filed several weeks ago by both Giuffre and the Duke of York’s legal teams. Giuffre on 14 January requested that Kaplan ask British authorities for help in obtaining testimony from Andrew’s former equerry, Robert Olney.  They also requested assistance in obtaining testimony from Shukri Walker, who claimed that she spotted the senior British royal at Tramp nightclub in London “with a young girl around the time that plaintiff contends Prince Andrew abused her in London after visiting Tramp Nightclub”. Both Olney and Walker live in England, Giuffre’s lawyers said in court documents. Walker’s attorney, Lisa Bloom, previously told The Guardian that “​​she is willing to do the deposition Virginia Giuffre’s team is seeking”. Andrew’s attorneys on 14 January asked Kaplan to seek assistance from Australian authorities in obtaining testimony from Giuffre’s husband, Robert, and Dr Judith Lightfoot, her psychologist. The embattled royal’s legal team contends that both live in Australia. Kaplan’s formal request does not come as a surprise. Both sides had asked for assistance in obtaining testimony for witnesses abroad. Giuffre has long accused Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell of forcing her into a sexual encounter with Andrew 20 years ago, when she was age 17. She has claimed that Andrew engaged in sexual misconduct with her on several other occasions. Giuffre sued Andrew on 9 August, alleging battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Andrew filed his response to her allegations on 26 January, denying all wrongdoing. In the “answer and affirmative defense,” the prince denied being a co-conspirator of Epstein. He also denied that Epstein “trafficked girls to him”. Epstein, a convicted sex offender, was arrest in July 2019 for sex trafficking girls as young as 14. He killed himself approximately one month later while jailed in Manhattan, pending his own sex-trafficking trial. Maxwell, daughter of the British press titan Robert Maxwell, was convicted of sex trafficking and related charges in December for bringing girls as young as 14 to Epstein, for him to sexually abuse. Giuffre’s legal action against Andrew has renewed attention on his links to Epstein and Maxwell. This heightened scrutiny has been calamitous for Andrew’s standing. Buckingham Palace remarked in a 13 January statement: “With the Queen’s approval and agreement, the Duke of York’s military affiliations and royal patronages have been returned to the Queen.

2/1/2022,"There is a common element in the myriad reports of alleged parties inside Downing Street: alcohol. From the photo of Boris Johnson sitting by a wine bottle in his garden to the claims of a suitcase of booze being wheeled into No 10, governing the country is clearly thirsty work. Some of the most shocking claims centred around an apparent culture of alcohol use within No 10, not least the “wine fridge” installed in an office, and the evocative image of an official being dispatched to the local Co-op to fill a suitcase with wine during a boozy leaving party.  Sue Gray’s report was quietly damning on this: “The excessive consumption of alcohol is not appropriate in a professional workplace at any time. Steps must be taken to ensure that every government department has a clear and robust policy in place covering the consumption of alcohol in the workplace.” There have been some tentative steps by Johnson supporters to address the issue, but they have sought to present it as a wider issue that goes beyond the Johnson team. “The task now is for us to address the underlying culture in Downing Street,” Oliver Dowden, the Conservative chair, said in a pointed remark earlier this month. This is heavily disputed by the former staff of previous PMs. “This culture didn’t exist when Oliver worked in No 10 for David Cameron. It didn’t exist when I worked there for Theresa May,” remarked Gavin Barwell, both a former Tory MP and May’s ex-chief of staff. “So I guess what Oliver is saying is the prime minister needs to change the culture he has presided over.” The truth would seem to fall somewhere between these two poles. It is hardly a secret that No 10 staff, particularly the predominantly young, very dedicated political appointees, who are paid well but face minimal job security, enjoy both a drink and a gossip – much like the journalists who cultivate them as sources. This is not unique to the current No 10. In pre-Johnson times, the pubs around Westminster, not least the Red Lion, a short trot from both parliament and Downing Street, were hardly lacking in custom. There are, however, two elements perhaps distinctive to the events uncovered in Gray’s report. One is that elements of Johnson’s Downing Street, including some of those associated with Vote Leave and Boris Johnson, brought with them a work culture of punishing hours and little time for socialising with non-colleagues. Drink inevitably played a role in this. Before the pandemic, a decidedly drunk-looking Cummings, clasping a glass of red wine, was once seen wandering along parliament’s press corridor asking directions to a particular newspaper office. There have also been repeated reports about a social culture centred around Carrie Johnson, albeit a less boozy one, involving friends of the PM’s wife of around her age who work in government. Perhaps more significant was an outside event: lockdown. With pubs closed but No 10 staff still in the office, alcohol became their outlet for socialising too. After all, they might have thought, they were together anyway and were working hard. As Gray notes, this is true: but so were many other people who did not break any rules.",News/Politics,Gray report criticises No 10’s ‘excessive’ alcohol culture,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/31/gray-report-criticises-boris-johnson-team-excessive-alcohol-culture
2/1/2022,"When Aaron Bell attended his grandmother’s funeral, he could not allow himself to hug his grieving parents and siblings. After she was laid to rest with only 10 mourners present, in accordance with Covid regulations, he turned around and drove the three hours home without stopping for a cup of tea, because those were the rules and in a pandemic they were to be obeyed. His question to Boris Johnson on Monday afternoon was couched in tones of barely suppressed fury: “Does the prime minister think I’m a fool?”  It’s the guilt, as Keir Starmer had rightly noted earlier in an extraordinarily emotionally charged afternoon in parliament, that for many people is the heartbreaker: the gut-wrenching feeling that if the man who made the Covid laws simply ignored them when it suited him, then maybe they, too, should have defied the rules to be with their loved ones as they died. Great leaders inspire us to be better people, but somehow Britain has ended up instead with a leader who makes people actively regret doing the right and selfless thing. It’s a point Aaron Bell could have been invented to illustrate, if it weren’t for the fact that Aaron Bell is the very real Conservative (and, yes, you read that right) MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme. When it finally emerged on Monday afternoon, handed over with all the ceremony of tablets of stone descending a mountain, Sue Gray’s report seemed initially like the dampest of squibs. Stripped of all the interesting bits, in response to last-minute concerns from the Metropolitan police about it compromising their even more last-minute inquiry, it could hardly have been otherwise. Yet even her deliberately terse account of 16 – 16, for heaven’s sake! – lockdown gatherings she examined noted that a whopping 12 of them met Scotland Yard’s threshold for investigation, including a party in Boris and Carrie Johnson’s private Downing Street flat on the night Dominic Cummings quit and the “bring a bottle” garden drinks we know that Johnson himself attended in May 2020, the month Bell went to that funeral. It is now overwhelmingly clear that the prime minister told parliament that no lockdown rules were broken in Downing Street when that was untrue. He lied to parliament, a resigning offence, and is now under police investigation for breaking the Covid laws he imposed on everyone else, to boot. “We must look ourselves in the mirror and learn,” Johnson solemnly declared, before disclosing that what he had personally seen was that someone else should be blamed. There will be a structural reform of the Whitehall machine, offering convenient cover for disposing of senior civil servants whose positions may look untenable after the police investigation, which can simultaneously be sold to MPs as “getting a grip” on a dysfunctional No 10 machine. Given its dysfunctionality comes directly from Johnson himself, the only possible response is: does he really think his own party is that stupid? His predecessor certainly wasn’t fooled. Theresa May, in a moment that felt as if it had been a long time coming, inquired icily whether the man who forced her out of office had failed to read his own rules, failed to understand them, or simply decided they didn’t apply to him, in a manner suggesting she felt all three were plausible. Her public denunciation, alongside that of Andrew Mitchell, the former chief whip, suggests that what remains of the old school one nation Conservative party – the moderate rump who always had their reservations about Johnson, as distinct from those Brexiters who have only recently turned on him and newer “red wallers” such as Bell – is getting organised. Since only his own MPs can depose a leader with Johnson’s majority, everything now rests on the sizeable number who claimed to be “waiting for Sue Gray” as a way of putting off the painful decision to unseat a sitting leader with little clarity about who or what might succeed him. In every coup there is always a core of MPs arguing that they just need to wait until after the local elections, or after the budget, or after anything else that seems reassuringly far away. For some, “waiting for Sue Gray” could all too easily evolve into “waiting for Sue Gray’s full report”, which could be months away, on the other side of a police investigation. The country, however, has waited more than long enough. What little Gray could say about all the parties she wasn’t allowed to write about – that there had been a “serious failure to observe” not just the high standards rightly expected of government but the basics expected of absolutely everyone else in a pandemic, plus “failures of leadership and judgment” in both No 10 and the Cabinet Office – merely confirmed the bleeding obvious, and yet that’s more than bad enough. Downing Street’s immediate answer to all this will be an unconvincing flurry of prime ministerial activity – touring eastern Europe, publishing a “levelling up” white paper – meant to portray him as irreplaceable. But it’s hard to reconcile this fantasy of an industrious statesman with stories about his red box lying unopened for a day outside the Downing Street flat at weekends, like a dirty breakfast tray abandoned outside a hotel room door, and with the lack of a serious long-term purpose that has left Whitehall departments and parliament alike with too much time on their hands. The only real strategy seems to be to trudge on deeper into the mire in the hope that everyone somehow gets used to being covered in muck; that we somehow forget how outrageous it is that Johnson seems to believe he can just carry on regardless, how bizarre that there should be no formal mechanism of impeachment for dishonesty, how enraging that we are all expected just to tolerate this degree of moral squalor at the heart of government for as long as his own party chooses to stomach it. It’s true, as Johnson’s allies say, that some voters are getting bored of hearing about parties when they face bigger problems in their daily lives. But a leader who seemingly can’t even control what happens under his own roof lacks the credibility to solve those problems, and sooner or later they will surely realise it. Until now, the most succinct summary of the situation has been the former cabinet minister David Davis’s call for Boris Johnson to “in the name of God, go”. But Aaron Bell has added another.

2/1/2022,"Ministers have announced plans to scrap an order forcing all NHS staff in England to get vaccinated against Covid, in a U-turn that will prevent an exodus of many thousands of frontline health workers. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, confirmed the move in a statement to MPs on Tuesday evening, ditching a policy that he had championed in spite of growing concern that it would endanger patient safety by triggering the loss of key personnel from the already understaffed health service.  The move came three days before the 3 February deadline that unvaccinated NHS workers who had face-to-face contact with patients had been given to have had their first dose or be dismissed. Javid also plans to remove immunisation as a condition of working in care homes, an approach that has already led to the loss of about 40,000 staff in that sector. He told MPs: “While vaccination remains our very best line of defence I believe it is no longer proportionate to require vaccination as a condition of deployment by statute. “I will launch a consultation on ending vaccination as condition of deployment in health and all social care settings. Subject to the response and the will of this house, the government will revoke these regulations,” he added. Sir David Nicholson, the chief executive of the NHS in England until 2014, summed up the frustration of many health service bosses about the 11th hour reversal when he said that “it’s hard to imagine a greater shambles”. The fact that the Omicron variant of coronavirus is much milder than its predecessor Delta, and that a large majority of the population have been fully vaccinated, justified the change, he said. The move comes after weeks of warnings from doctors’ organisations that pressing ahead with the policy would lead to even greater staff shortages, particularly in maternity services, and especially in hospitals in London and Birmingham, which have significant numbers of unvaccinated staff, notably nurses and midwives.",News/Society,Ministers plan to scrap vaccine mandate for NHS staff in England,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/31/ministers-plan-to-scrap-vaccine-mandate-for-nhs-staff-in-england
2/1/2022,"Spotify has said it will add “content advisories” to episodes of Joe Rogan’s podcast discussing Covid after the singers Neil Young and Joni Mitchell accused the streaming service of helping to spread Covid misinformation. The musicians are critical of Rogan, who has recently sparked controversy over comments made by himself and some of his guests about the pandemic.  So, what does the science say about some of Rogan’s most controversial claims? Rogan has claimed he isn’t anti-vaccine, but during a 23 April 2021 episode of his podcast he said: “If you’re like 21 years old, and you say to me, should I get vaccinated? I’ll go, no.” Although it’s true that older people are at greater risk of severe disease and death, younger people can and do die from Covid-19. According to the latest UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) figures, there have been 39 deaths in 20- to 29-year-olds with laboratory-confirmed Covid in England since January 2021. Among those aged 30-39, there have been 185 deaths during the same period. That’s lower than the 18,931 deaths in people aged 80+, but not insignificant. “Young people still get severe illness from Covid-19, and the benefits, directly to the young person, purely in terms of their risk of serious illness are much greater than any risks from vaccination,” said Dr Richard Tedder, a member of the UK Clinical Virology Network. Separate research on 73,197 UK adults who were admitted to hospital during the pandemic’s first wave found that 27% of 19- to 29-year-olds suffered damage to their kidneys, lungs or other organs as a result of Covid-19, while 13% left hospital with a reduced ability to care for themselves. In his 12 January 2022 episode, Rogan claimed the risk of myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation) among vaccinated 12- to 17-year-olds was higher than the risk associated with catching Covid. But his guest, the Australian broadcaster Josh Szeps, argued that, in fact, young males infected with the virus were up six times more likely to develop myocarditis as those who had received the vaccine. Szeps cited data from the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, suggesting a rate of about 450 myocarditis cases in every million Covid-19 infections among boys aged 12-17, compared with 77 cases a million after vaccination. Separate data from 38.6 million people aged 16+ who were vaccinated in England identified an extra two to six myocarditis cases in every million people in the 28 days after receiving a first dose of the AstraZeneca, Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, and an extra 10 cases a million after a second dose of the Moderna vaccine. This compared with an additional 40 cases a million people in the 28 days after a positive Covid test. “The risk of myocarditis is substantially higher following Covid infection than vaccination in the general population, but remains very infrequent following either,” said Nicholas Mills, a British Heart Foundation professor of cardiology at the University of Edinburgh, who was involved in the study. “The majority of reports suggest that when it arises following vaccination it is mild and self-limiting.” During his 18 June 2021 podcast, Rogan’s guest, the evolutionary biologist Bret Weinstein, claimed that “ivermectin alone, if properly utilised, is capable of driving this pathogen to extinction”. On 2 September, Rogan announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19 and was also taking the anti-parasitic drug. Although he recovered, ivermectin is unlikely to explain why: according to a recent Cochrane Review, which analysed data from multiple studies, there is no evidence to support the use of ivermectin either for preventing or treating Covid. “Because of a lack of good-quality evidence, we do not know whether ivermectin administered in hospital or in an outpatient setting leads to more or fewer deaths after one month when compared with a placebo or usual care,” its authors said. In his 20 August 2021, podcast, Rogan claimed the Pfizer and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines were not really vaccines, but gene therapy. “A vaccine is where they take a dead virus, and they turn it into a vaccine, and they inject it into your body so that your body fights off [the infection],” he said. “This is really gene therapy. It’s a different thing. It’s tricking your body into producing spike protein and making these antibodies for Covid.” It’s true that mRNA vaccines persuade our own cells to manufacture the viral spike protein, which in turn prompts the production of antibodies. However, whereas gene therapy is designed to permanently alter an individual’s genes, mRNA vaccines issue instructions to protein-making machinery located in the cytoplasm, which degrade after about 72 hours. Because immune cells are able to remember pieces of virus they’ve encountered, this temporary encounter still has a lasting effect, but it doesn’t alter our genome. Other types of vaccines, such as the influenza or hepatitis B vaccine, also expose the immune system to viral proteins, albeit pre-assembled ones. On 24 December 2021, Rogan told the US comedian Tim Dillon that his Vancouver show had been cancelled because Canada required proof of vaccination to attend live events. Referencing his earlier Covid infection, Rogan said “I’m not gonna get vaccinated. I have antibodies, it doesn’t make any sense.” Although so-called natural immunity is likely to provide some protection against subsequent infection, vaccination would strengthen and extend the duration of that response. Tedder said: “About one in five people who get Covid do not generate a useful immune response, and those who do gain a valuable ‘booster’ effect if they are subsequently vaccinated, deepening and enhancing their immune response so that it lasts for longer, and is better able to recognise new variants.” Rogan has also spoken out against lockdowns, arguing that they can perpetuate the spread of Covid-19. “It makes things worse, you know why – because people go inside. They are trapped inside and that’s where it spreads,” he said. However, according to an analysis of the impact of lockdowns and social distancing in 11 European countries, published in Nature, such measures together have a “substantial effect” on transmission. “It is true that, since the virus is airborne, transmission is more likely indoors, particularly if ventilation is poor; but the point of lockdowns is to reduce the number of contacts, and thus the likelihood of encountering somebody who is infectious,” Tedder said.",Arts/Culture,Joe Rogan’s Covid claims: what does the science actually say?,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/31/joe-rogan-covid-claims-what-does-the-science-actually-say
2/1/2022,"A journalist and former member of parliament who helped uncover one of the worst miscarriages of justice in British history is to fight a police attempt to force him to reveal source material for his research into the Birmingham pub bombings. Chris Mullin, 74, said he will contest an order served on him by police in relation to his investigation into the Birmingham Six, whose convictions were quashed in 1991.  “If West Midlands police had carried out a proper investigation after the bombings, instead of framing the first half-dozen people unlucky enough to fall into their hands, they might have caught the real perpetrators in the first place. “It is beyond irony. They appear to have gone for the guy who blew the whistle,” he said. A court hearing is scheduled for the Old Bailey on 23 and 24 February where Mullin will be represented by Gavin Millar QC. West Midlands police have applied for an order requiring Mullin to disclose material in relation to his 1985-1986 investigation into the bombings in 1974 under the Terrorism Act 2000. Journalists are professionally bound to maintain confidentiality of sources and many, over the years, have said they would be prepared to go to jail rather than reveal sources. “The principle of protecting your source and keeping your word when confidentiality is pledged is a vital one for all journalists and lies at the heart of the NUJ’s code of conduct. The case brought by West Midlands police risks compromising that core principle and undermining press freedom, which is why the NUJ stands four-square behind Chris and is backing this case,” said Michelle Stanistreet, NUJ general secretary. In one of the earliest cases to test the principle, Goodwin v the United Kingdom in 1996, the European court of human rights backed a journalist with The Engineer magazine, Bill Goodwin, after a court in Britain tried to force him to reveal a source. Mullin’s book, Error of Judgment: The Truth About The Birmingham Bombings, was published 36 years ago with further editions published in 1987, 1990 and 1997. Police believe Mullin has interviews that could confirm the identity of a surviving member of the IRA gang behind the pub bombings. A spokesperson for West Midlands police confirmed the proceedings and said the force remained committed to bringing those responsible for the bombings to justice. “It would not be appropriate to comment further at this stage,” they said.",News/UK news,Chris Mullin to resist police order to reveal IRA pub bombing sources,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/31/chris-mullin-to-resist-police-order-to-reveal-ira-pub-bombing-sources
2/1/2022,"A multimillionaire Azerbaijani politician and his family have been ordered to hand over £5.6m of suspect funds brought into the UK via a complex money-laundering scheme nicknamed the “Azerbaijani laundromat”. A judge on Monday ordered that Javanshir Feyziyev and his family forfeit £5.63m held in various bank accounts after ruling the funds “arise from criminal conduct” and “money laundering”.  The National Crime Agency (NCA) said Feyziyev, a serving member of the Azerbaijan parliament, brought millions of pounds of illicit wealth into the UK via the laundromat. The money laundering scheme was revealed in 2017 when confidential banking records were leaked to the Danish newspaper Berlingske and shared with the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, the Guardian, and other media partners. The data showed that the Azerbaijani leadership, accused of serial human rights abuses, systemic corruption and rigging elections, made more than 16,000 covert payments between 2012 and 2014 – worth on average about $3m a day. The National Crime Agency (NCA), which is investigating the international money laundering ring, had applied to the court to seize £15.3m of suspect funds from the family. Westminster magistrates court district judge John Zani ruled on Monday that Feyziyev, his wife Parvana Feyziyeva, their son Orkhan, and a nephew, Elman Javanshir, must hand over a total of £5.6m after finding “key elements of money laundering”. The NCA said the judge agreed there was “overwhelming evidence” that documents the family supplied to support their claims that the funds were generated lawfully were “entirely fictitious and were produced in order to mask the underlying money-laundering activities of those orchestrating the accounts”. Feyziyev, who lives in a multimillion-pound Grade I-listed John Nash-designed mansion overlooking Regent’s Park in London, is chair of the UK-Azerbaijan all-parliamentary cooperation committee and co-chair of the EU parliament’s equivalent body. Andy Lewis, head of civil recovery at the NCA, said: “This is a substantial forfeiture of money laundered through the Azerbaijan laundromat, and our success highlights the risk to anyone who uses these schemes. “We were able to recover these millions without needing to prove the exact nature of the original criminal activity. We will continue to use civil powers to target money entering the UK via illegitimate means.” Last year the NCA seized £4m from another London-based Azerbaijani couple in connection with the laundromat scheme. Suleyman Javadov and his wife Izzat Khanim Javadova, the well-known Ibiza DJ Mikaela Jav, agreed to hand over the money in July after admitting in a settlement that it came into the country illegally. Javadov is the son of a former Azerbaijan deputy energy minister. Javadova is the daughter of oligarch Jalal Aliyev, an uncle of the country’s president Ilham Aliyev.",News/Business,Azerbaijan ‘laundromat’ – court orders family to hand over £5.6m brought into UK,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/31/azerbaijan-laundromat-court-orders-family-to-hand-over-56m-brought-into-uk
