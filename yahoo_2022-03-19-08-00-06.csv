3/19/2022,"LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) — Officials at Walt Disney World said Friday that a performance by a visiting Texas high school drill team that used American Indian stereotypes, including chants of “scalp them,"" doesn't reflect the Florida resort's values. The performance this week in the Magic Kingdom by the “Indianettes"" drill team from Port Neches-Grove High School “did not reflect our core values, and we regret it took place,"" Disney spokeswoman Jacquee Wahler said in an emailed statement. An audition tape that the school had provided in order to be selected to perform at the theme park resort was inconsistent with the actual performance, the statement said. Wahler said new measures have been implemented to prevent that from happening again. She did not elaborate. In a video of the performance posted on Twitter, members of the drill team are seen tapping their hands over their mouths and whooping, as a drum pounds in the background, in what is stereotypically called a “war cry.” Cortnie Schexnaider, the director of the drill team, didn't respond to an email seeking comment. Port Neches is located near the Gulf Coast about 13 miles (20 kilometers) southeast of Beaumont, Texas.",U.S./Associated Press,Disney 'regrets' performance by visiting school drill team,https://news.yahoo.com/disney-regrets-performance-visiting-school-213338165.html
3/19/2022,"About three dozen would-be asylum seekers from Russia found themselves blocked from entering the U.S. on Friday while a group of Ukrainians flashed passports and were escorted across the border. The scene reflected a quiet but unmistakable shift in the differing treatment of Russians and Ukrainians who enter Mexico as tourists and fly to Tijuana, hoping to enter the U.S. for a chance at asylum. The Russians — 34 as of Friday — had been camped several days at the busiest U.S border crossing with Mexico, two days after city of Tijuana officials gently urged them to leave. They sat on mats and blankets, checking smartphones, chatting and snacking, with sleeping bags and strollers nearby as a stream of pedestrian border crossers filed past them. Five young girls sat and talked in a circle, some with stuffed animals. Days earlier, some Russians were being admitted to the U.S. at the San Ysidro crossing, while some Ukrainians were blocked. But by Friday, Russians were denied while Ukrainians were admitted after short waits. “It’s very hard to understand how they make decisions,” said Iirina Zolinka, a 40-year-old Russian woman who camped overnight with her family of seven after arriving in Tijuana on Thursday. Erika Pinheiro, litigation and policy director for advocacy group Al Otro Lado, said the U.S. began admitting all Ukrainians on humanitarian parole for one year around Tuesday, while at the same time blocking all Russians. There was no official announcement. A Homeland Security Department memo dated March 11 but not publicly released until Thursday told border officials that Ukrainians may be exempt from sweeping asylum limits designed to prevent spread of COVID-19. It says decisions are to be made case-by-case for Ukrainians but makes no mention of Russians. “The Department of Homeland Security recognizes that the unjustified Russian war of aggression in Ukraine has created a humanitarian crisis,” the memo states. Russian migrants in Tijuana sat off to the side of a line of hundreds of border residents waiting to walk across the border to San Diego on Friday. The line was unimpeded. A 32-year-old Russian migrant who hadn’t left the border crossing since arriving in Tijuana with his wife about five days earlier had no plans to leave, fearing he may miss any sudden opportunity. Within hours of arriving, the migrant, who identified himself only as Mark because he feared for his family's safety in Russia, saw three Russian migrants admitted to the United States. After six hours, U.S. authorities returned his passport and said only Ukrainians were being admitted. “Ukrainians and Russians are suffering because of one man,” Mark said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He fled shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. U.S. officials have expelled migrants more than 1.7 million times since March 2020 without a chance to see asylum under sweeping authority aimed at preventing spread of COVID-19. But the public health authority, known as Title 42, is seldom used for migrants of some nationalities who are difficult to expel for financial or diplomatic reasons. But to claim asylum, migrants must be on U.S. soil and U.S. officials are blocking passage except for those it wants to admit. Even before Russia’s invasion, the United States was seeing an increase in Russian and Ukrainian asylum seekers,  most trying to enter at official crossings in San Diego rather than trying to cross illegally in deserts and mountains. More than 1,500 Ukrainians entered the U.S. on the Mexican border from September through February, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, about 35 times the 45 Ukrainians who crossed during the same period a year earlier. Ukrainians who can reach U.S. soil are virtually guaranteed a shot at asylum. Only four of the 1,553 who entered in the September-February period were barred under the public health order that lets the U.S. expel migrants without a chance at humanitarian protection. The number of Russian asylum seekers entering at U.S land crossings from Mexico surpassed 8,600 from September through February, about 30 times the 288 the same time a year earlier. All but 23 were processed under laws that allow them to seek asylum. Mexican officials have been wary of migrants sleeping at the border. Last month they dismantled a large migrant camp in Tijuana with tents and tarps that blocked a walkway to San Diego. Eager to stop another camp from forming, the city distributed a letter on Wednesday asking migrants to leave their campsites for health and safety reasons and offered free shelter if they couldn't afford a hotel.",World/Associated Press,"Russians are blocked at US border, Ukrainians are admitted",https://news.yahoo.com/russians-blocked-us-border-ukrainians-221951267.html
3/19/2022,"7,000 Russian troops have been killed in battle, according to a US intelligence estimate. Russian troop deaths are already more than the number of American troops killed in either the Iraq or Afghanistan wars. At this rate, Russia is suffering what could soon be unsustainable losses. In the three weeks since Russia launched its war against Ukraine, the fighting has taken a heavy toll on both sides and the civilians trapped in cities like Kharkiv and Mariupol, where authorities are trying to rescue 1,300 people who had sheltered in a theater that was attacked. The toll also appears to be huge and mounting for Russia's military. Seven thousand Russian troops have been killed in battle so far, according to a US intelligence estimate reported by the New York Times, and that's a conservative estimate. Four Russian generals have died and the Times reported on March 16 that between 14,000 and 21,000 Russians troops had been injured. By this estimate, Russian military deaths are now much higher than the number of American troops killed in either the Iraq or Afghanistan wars, at 4,825 and 3,576 respectively. The Russian casualties appear to be of a scale similar to those at Iwo Jima — one of the bloodiest battles in Marine Corps history – where about 6,852 US troops died and around 19,000 were injured in five weeks of fighting against an entrenched Japanese force, which sustained an estimated 18,000 dead and missing. If Russian forces were to continue losing troops at this rate, in a year about 121,000 Russian troops would be dead, with injured likely to be three or four times higher — suggesting Russia's offensive must break the Ukrainian resistance or suffer unsustainable losses. That toll, for example, would be higher than American casualties during the Korean War, where 36,576 Americans died over the course of three years. Ukraine's military has also suffered heavy losses, likely to be much higher than the 1,300 troops Ukraine has confirmed as killed.

3/19/2022,"The clearly deranged boyfriend of Gretta Vedler, a Russian model who famously accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of being a “psychopath,” has reportedly confessed to murdering her and keeping her corpse hidden for a year inside a suitcase, according to Russian media reports. Vedler, 23, vanished soon after criticizing Putin in January 2021, and friends quickly grew concerned for her safety after she continued to post on her social media account without responding to their calls. “Given the fact that Putin went through a lot of humiliation in childhood, he could not stand up for himself due to his [slight] physical form, it is not surprising that he left after law school and joined the KGB,” Vedler wrote in a now-removed social media post, according to the Mirror. “Such people are timid and fearful from childhood, afraid of noise and darkness, strangers, so traits such as caution, restraint, and lack of communication are developed early in their character. I can only assume, in my opinion, a clear psychopathy or sociopathy is seen in him.” She disappeared shortly after the post, which was apparently removed by Russian censors. This week, Vedler’s erstwhile boyfriend, Dmitry Korovin, confessed to strangling her to death after the two argued not over politics but over money in Moscow in February 2021. He said he continued to post old photos on her social accounts so as not to arouse suspicion that she might be dead, according to authorities. Since her disappearance, many Russian activists expressed concern that she was either taken into custody or worse after her anti-Putin post, which coincided with a crackdown on dissidents in the country. Her friend Evgeniy Foster, a Ukrainian blogger who lives in Kharkiv, was fearful that Putin had ordered her demise, posting a number of accusations on his Instagram account. Instead, Korovin told Russian authorities—who published a video of his confession in Russian media—that he slept by her corpse for three days after strangling her to death and then bought a suitcase to dispose of her body, which he kept in the trunk of his car for nearly a year. It is unclear when he abandoned the car, but authorities found it this week after being tipped off by a friend of Korovin who filed a missing-person report, reportedly at his insistence. The suitcase with Vedler’s body was found some 300 miles from Moscow. Vedler’s friends said she told them that Korovin was “abusive” and angry. Read more at The Daily Beast.
