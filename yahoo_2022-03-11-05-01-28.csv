3/11/2022,"Don't overlook Amazon's big $10 billion stock buyback announcement in the press release detailing a 20-for-1 stock split, pros say. ""The buyback story might be even more relevant here,"" said John Hancock Investment Management co-chief investment strategist Emily Roland on Yahoo Finance Live. ""The technology companies have taken it on the chin this year, meanwhile the fundamentals are there."" Large companies such as Amazon (AMZN) are starting to take advantage of a huge amount of cash on their balance sheets and buy back their stock to highlight great fundamentals, Roland added. In the case of Amazon, its stock is down 4% in the past year amid concerns about slowing profit growth. But the company's buyback may signal it's poised to slow down on its various investments to show investors better profits, which could help the stock price. Shares of the e-commerce giant gained 5% on Thursday as traders cheered Amazon's stock split and new buyback. The stock was the top trending ticker on the Yahoo Finance platform. Amazon's stock split is the fourth one in its history. The last split came in September 1999. If shareholders approve of the split, it will begin trading on the new basis on June 6. ""Big tech stalwarts all saw massive strength during the pandemic and the stocks are now ripe for a split. Amazon is following the lead of Apple, Tesla, and Alphabet on the stock split path. These are smart moves as investors positively digest stock splits. We believe tech names are oversold as we seen in five years,"" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance.

3/11/2022,"The Great Resignation shocked economists and CEOs alike in the summer of 2021 when 4 million American workers started quitting their jobs every month. Seven months on, it’s still happening. And why shouldn’t it spill into 2022, when data clearly shows that this many quits likely leads to workers seeing better pay, more flexibility, and greater opportunities for career growth at their new jobs? At least 4 million Americans have quit their jobs every month since July 2021. In January, about 4.3 million Americans, or 2.8% of workers, walked out the door, according to the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Wednesday. That’s down by about 275,000 resignations from November, when the quit rate hit the highest level recorded by the BLS since the survey launched in 2000. View this interactive chart on Fortune.com For many, quitting paid off. Over half, or 56%, of U.S. adults surveyed by Pew Research Center say they’re earning more money at their new job. A majority also noted they now had more flexibility around their work hours, better opportunities for career growth, and an easier time juggling work/life balance. Among the reasons U.S. workers cited as prompting them to quit in 2021 were low pay (63%), followed by a lack of career advancement opportunities and feeling “disrespected” at work, Pew found. View this interactive chart on Fortune.com The average hourly wage has crept up by about 5% over the past 12 months, hitting $31.58 for nonfarm workers last month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics employment report issued last week. That’s created a squeeze for companies, many of whom are battling higher operating costs, inflation, and supply-chain challenges—in addition to being forced to raise wages to attract and retain employees. Overall, companies are set to increase worker wages by 3.9% in 2022, according to the Conference Board. But what’s proved a struggle for companies is good news for workers—at least for now. “We definitely see improvements for sure,” Juliana Horowitz, associate director of research with Pew, tells Fortune. “We know that low pay and the lack of opportunities for advancement, were among the top reasons why people said they quit. And so the fact that sizable shares of people say that they have more of these things—they have higher pay and more opportunities in their current job—is definitely an improvement.” About one in five U.S. workers who haven’t yet retired quit their jobs at some point last year, according to a new survey from Pew. Changing jobs was much more prevalent among younger workers (those ages 18 to 29), as well as lower-income Americans, Pew found. View this interactive chart on Fortune.com But while most workers saw employer offerings improve in a number of areas, benefits—which 43% of workers cited as a reason to leave—were one factor that didn’t see much change. Just over a third of workers say the benefits at their new job are about the same as their previous perks, while 22% actually report worse benefits. And those pay increases tended to be common among those with a degree. About 66% of those with a college education say they’re now earning more compared with 51% without a degree.
