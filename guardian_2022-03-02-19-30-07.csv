3/2/2022,"The World Cup that begins on Friday will be New Zealand’s first chance to play host to the women’s tournament in 22 years. The 2000 edition, held in the pre-professional era when the game was still governed by the volunteer-run, perpetually-strapped-for-cash International Women’s Cricket Council, looked quite different to anything the current set of players will be used to. Across four weeks in November and December 2000, the eight teams were put up in student accommodation at Lincoln University in Christchurch, lived together, trained together, and ate meals together. It would be fair to say that the women’s game has been on quite the journey since then: the ICC took over in 2005, and professionalisation has trickled in since 2014. While the format of the 2022 tournament is the same as 2000 – an eight-team round-robin culminating in semi-finals and a final – the logistics are very different. This time, the eight teams (Australia, England, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, West Indies and Bangladesh) will embark on an odyssey around New Zealand. The tournament will see six venues utilised across six different cities on the North and South Islands, countless chartered flights, and the use of five-star hotels to accommodate the teams and support staff. The idea that Heather Knight and Meg Lanning might casually encounter one another over breakfast before taking to the field against each other later that day – as Clare Connor and Belinda Clark did in 2000 – seems unlikely, to say the least. To see this as straightforward “progress” would be to disregard the environmental impact of all that internal travel (something we ignore at our peril, given the impact that the climate crisis is already having on cricket). The idea of persisting with a six-city World Cup in the middle of a global pandemic – Omicron is spreading like wildfire through the New Zealand population as we speak – also feels, frankly, irresponsible. Wanting to share hosting rights across the country when the tournament was conceived in 2019 is one thing, but the ICC has now had two years to rethink the schedule. Why could they not have followed the model of the 2000 World Cup? Placing all teams in one bubble (as was done for the 2020-21 Women’s Big Bash League) would have minimised the danger of a Covid outbreak, even if it might have risked Knight and Lanning staring daggers at each other over the coffee pot. Instead, the ICC’s “contingency plan” involves the extraordinary introduction – announced last week – of a new rule: in the event of a Covid eruption, teams will be permitted to field nine players, plus two “substitutes” from within their management team. The players have stopped short of being publicly critical – in a classic example of doublespeak, Lanning labelled the rule “interesting” – but should Australia fail to win the final in Christchurch on 3 April because only nine of their players can bat, she might well revert to a shorter, four-letter word. And she would be right. This is the premier tournament for the women’s game, not a Jumpers For Goalposts hit-out in the local park. What is the ICC thinking? All told, the warmup period to the tournament has not exactly inspired confidence in cricket’s global governing body. The official captains’ photograph, released last week, smacked of being a bodge-job: the stand on which the World Cup trophy rested was propped up on a brick, while the framing made Lanning looked like she should be entering a contest for World’s Tallest Woman. Over the weekend, the ICC then created confusion by posting a scorecard which suggested South Africa had defeated India by four wickets in an official warmup game, before a different scorecard did the rounds on Twitter showing (correctly) a two-run win by India; the ICC’s reporting had to be hastily corrected. We may be living in a new professional era for women’s cricket but the ICC can still, it seems, bungle it with the best of them. England fans will be hoping that none of this circus distracts the reigning champions from their goal of becoming back-to-back global champions. Even if they remain fit and well – and Heather Knight admitted in Friday’s press conference that a Covid-free World Cup was “probably unlikely” – that is going to to take some doing. The glories of Lord’s in July 2017 felt a long way distant during the ODI leg of the recent Women’s Ashes series, which saw England bowled out for 178, 129 and 163. The official word from the England camp is that a seven-day mandatory quarantine and a week in Queenstown have allowed them to “park” their Ashes defeat: “Those final two games were a bit of mental and physical fatigue from the side, and not a true representation of where we’re at and who we are,” Knight said on Friday. The coming weeks will show how much of that is mere bravado. Who might steal England’s World Cup crown? It has to be said that for all the possibility of Covid uncertainty – as well as nine-player matches, there is also the prospect of rearranged games (the ICC said fixtures will be rescheduled if necessary) – there is a familiar feeling of inevitability surrounding the tournament: once again, Lanning’s Australia are firm favourites. Then again, they were favourites 22 years ago as well; and things didn’t quite go to plan. Australia made the final but the 2000 World Cup ultimately ended in New Zealand being crowned champions, after a nail-biting four-run win against their old Trans-Tasman rivals. It’s the only time, to date, that they have lifted a global trophy. Current captain Sophie Devine, who remembers watching that match on TV as an 11-year-old, appears to have taken some motivation from her forebears. In a shock result on Tuesday, the warmup match between the two sides saw Australia thumped by nine wickets, as New Zealand successfully chased down their 322-run target with ease. As for Devine? She hit a mere 161 not out. History might just be about to repeat itself.  This is an extract from the Guardian’s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

3/2/2022,"As podcast listenership rose over the pandemic, reports emerged of people developing a kind of parasocial intimacy with podcast hosts – feeling, in some cases, like they were friends. Now, new research has revealed that how we chose to listen to podcasts could actually be enhancing our perceived intimacy with their hosts. Researchers from UC San Diego’s Rady School, UCLA, and UC Berkeley have found that when people listen to auditory messages – like podcasts, audiobooks, and radio news – via headphones, they feel more empathic and persuadable than when listening to those same messages through speakers. In one experiment, participants listened to a speech clip from a CEO whose company provides visual information for the blind. After listening to the speech, participants were asked whether they would write a letter in support of the CEO winning an award for her work. People who listened to the podcast via headphones were twice as likely to agree to write a nomination (30%) compared to those who listened via speakers (14%). Researchers found headphones are a superconductor for emotional connection due to the phenomenon of “in-head localization.” Because headphones make it sound like the voices are coming from inside your head, they “trigger a feeling of greater closeness to the person speaking to you”, explains On Amir, co-author of the study, which is forthcoming in the journal Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes. The idea for the study was sparked one day when UCLA Anderson School of Management assistant professor Alicea Lieberman turned on the podcast This American Life in her car. As a longtime listener, Lieberman felt she had developed a kind of relationship with its host, Ira Glass. However, that day she noticed something strange about Glass’ distinctive intonations coming through the speakers in her car. “I remember being like, ‘Oh, I don’t feel the connection with him that I normally feel when I listen through my headphones,” she says. That was a “click moment” for Lieberman. “I was like, ‘Wait a minute, why is that happening? And what does that mean for how I actually perceive these stories.” To test the hypothesis that headphones facilitate deeper emotional connections to storytellers and their narratives, Lieberman and fellow researchers conducted five separate studies involving a total of over 4,000 participants. In one experiment, subjects used either headphones or speakers to listen to a PSA about the dangers of distracted driving, narrated by a person whose parents had died in a car accident. Headphone listeners later reported being more concerned about the threat posed by distracted driving than participants who heard the message via speakers. Some may wonder whether headphone use could have contributed to the vast influence of certain podcast phenoms, such as Alex Cooper (who averages 3 million listeners per episode for her Call Me Daddy podcast), Ben Shapiro (2.6 million tune in to his rightwing views) and Joe Rogan – who Vox Media has described as “one of the most formidable single voices in media to exist — maybe ever” and averages around 11 million an episode. And there may be implications beyond podcasting too – remote workers could feel more connected to their colleagues by using headphones during Zoom calls, for example. Marketers may be keen to learn more about headphone habits to appeal to shoppers at their most suggestible, and politicians could proselytize to their constituencies during rallies that look like silent discos. What could happen if they tested other types of content is still an unanswered question; Lieberman, however, has a few hunches. “You could imagine if somebody really disliked Joe Rogan – hand raised – and I was more likely to feel reactive to him, then I might have a stronger negative reaction and be like, ‘Oh my gosh, don’t put him in my head, I want to get away from this person.’”",Arts/Television & radio,"Listening to podcasts on headphones increases ‘perceived intimacy’ with host, research finds",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/02/podcasts-headphones-perceived-intimacy-host-increased
3/2/2022,"For the past five months Anna Hokuf has lived in her car with her cat after she left an abusive home environment. Trying to save enough money to secure an apartment doing odd jobs while homeless has been hard enough for the 19-year-old. Now rising gas prices have made it all but impossible. “I don’t have the ability to save much money and gas prices being as high as they are at almost $4 a gallon really makes being homeless tough,” said Hokuf, of the Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, area. “I have to keep my car on all the time to stay warm and to keep my cat warm, which wastes more gas and has caused a strain on my car.” It takes about $60 to fill up Hokuf’s car’s tank and about $40 a day for gas to keep warm at night. Her food options are limited as she doesn’t have any way to heat food. She showers and does laundry intermittently whenever she can scrounge enough money for a hotel room for a night or two. “Unfortunately all the money I’m able to receive generally goes to gas or food for my cat,” she said. Gas prices have soared over the past year and are expected to continue climbing as the Russian invasion of Ukraine further disrupts oil production, production that was already suffering from the impact of Covid-19. Last week the price of oil hit its highest in more than seven years and the war threatens to stoke the US’s already troubling inflation issues. The Biden administration has pledged to take action to curb rising gas prices with the announcement of economic sanctions on Russia, which is the second largest oil producer and exporter in the world. So far the sanctions have not included Russia’s oil and gas industry, as Europe is heavily dependent on it and doing so would cause oil prices to spike even further. According to the American Automobile Association, the average gallon of gas in the US is $3.619 as of 1 March, compared with $2.72 a gallon one year ago. States with the highest average gas prices include California at $4.837 a gallon and Hawaii at $4.565 a gallon, with Arkansas the lowest at $3.243 a gallon. Oil companies have reaped enormous profits from rising gas prices over the past year, with the largest 24 oil companies reporting $174bn in profits in the first nine months of 2021, as companies have rejected requests to increase oil production to mitigate price increases. In the meantime the rising gas prices are disproportionately hurting low-income Americans, especially a growing segment of the US homeless population that lives out of their vehicles. In Michigan, a young woman living out of her car who requested to remain anonymous makes money by delivering food and groceries through gig apps, spending anywhere from $10 to $15 a day to $100 a day on gas. They have lived in their car since the end of December after losing their job in September and couldn’t afford to stay in their apartment. They rely on a Planet Fitness gym membership to shower regularly “Having to idle for heat when I’m in colder areas definitely takes a toll on my gas mileage,” they said. “I don’t have the greatest credit, so buying a home is out of range for me currently, and with rent skyrocketing and most requiring income to be two to three times the rent it’s impossible to find anything affordable.” Louie Vashiomiattii of Auburn, Washington, moved into his van about two months ago when his landlord of three years opted to sell the house where he was renting a basement apartment, and he couldn’t afford to move into a new apartment in the area as rents have soared over the past year. “It’s the most stressful thing I deal with every day,” said Vashiomiattii. “I didn’t realize how much gas would cost when I moved into my van.” He spends about $40 a day on gas, with much of it used to keep warm through the winter. He currently works a job in retail and is struggling to save money with high gas prices, as the apartments in his area require first and last month’s rent in addition to a security deposit. Rising gas prices are also significantly hurting rideshare drivers, who already operate on thin profit margins. Ben Valdez, a part-time Uber driver in Los Angeles, California, for six years, has reduced his work hours to only when surge pricing is available as gas prices in the area have hit about $5 a gallon. “As gas prices went up, and as demand went down, I just started seeing less and less reason to drive,” said Valdez, who spends anywhere from $35 a night when he drives to $75 to fill his gas tank. “A lot of drivers are starting to feel the pinch. It’s really, really expensive to put gas in.”",News/Business,‘It’s the most stressful thing’: rising US gas prices are new blow for homeless,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/02/us-gas-prices-homeless-people-living-in-vehicles
3/2/2022,"The House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol is asking the former Trump lawyer John Eastman to prioritize turning over records with certain keywords as he complies with his subpoena – a list of terms that reveal the panel’s focus as it investigates a potential conspiracy. The keywords include a Gmail address used by Donald Trump’s former chief of staff Mark Meadows and the names of various individuals involved in the effort to overturn the 2020 election, from top Trump aides to Republican members of Congress to the former justice department official Jeffrey Clark. The search terms list – which the select committee transmitted to Eastman – provides a glimpse of what House investigators suspect might be contained among the thousands of emails and documents that Eastman is being forced to review to comply with his subpoena. But the keywords also reveal the current investigative focus of the panel and the role Eastman played as one of the leading members of the Trump “war room” at the Willard hotel in Washington that coordinated Trump’s plan to return himself to office on 6 January 2021. The list is intended to act as a dragnet to catch his records from 4 to 7 January about efforts to overturn the 2020 election results between Eastman and individuals in different “centres of gravity”, according to a source with direct knowledge of the investigation. One focus for the select committee is Eastman’s records concerning Donald Trump, former vice-president Mike Pence and top Trump officials, where keywords include items as simple as “Trump”, or “EOP”, the government acronym for the executive office of the president. The select committee is examining Eastman’s records about Republican members of Congress including Andy Biggs, Mo Brooks, Ted Cruz, Louie Gohmert, Paul Gosar, Josh Hawley, Cindy Hyde-Smith, Jim Jordan, Cynthia Lummis, Roger Marshall, Doug Mastriano, Scott Perry and Tommy Tuberville. Another priority for the panel is messages between Eastman and those he communicated with across the federal government. The list includes the domains “usdoj.gov” and “justice.gov” for the justice department, “senate.gov” for the Senate, and “house.gov” for the House. The select committee’s addition of “congressnc@gmail.com” – a sometime email address used by Meadows, who was a House Republican representing North Carolina before he became Trump’s final chief of staff – indicates it also wants messages not in official email records. The keywords also account for typos. In seeking Eastman’s messages with former Trump White House counsel Pat Cipollone, for instance, the panel included misspellings of his name they have found in other documents, from “Cippolone” to “Cippollone”. The list of terms is speculative insofar as it amounts only to what the select committee hopes are among Eastman’s most sensitive records and messages. But the keywords are there because the panel has reason to believe such communications exist, the source said. Taken together, the source said, the keywords reflect the panel’s suspicion that Eastman was at the heart of what could amount to an unlawful conspiracy between the Trump White House, GOP members of Congress and Trump loyalists at DoJ to obstruct Congress on 6 January. A spokesperson for the panel declined to comment. Eastman did not respond to a request for comment ahead of a hearing next week where he will attempt to withhold from the select committee documents he believes are protected by executive and attorney-client privilege. The list of keywords for Eastman also reflects the new urgency that has gripped the panel in recent weeks as it races to complete the evidence-gathering phase of the investigation. The panel is cognizant of how its investigators have managed to upend Washington with aggressive subpoena tactics more commonly seen in criminal prosecutions than congressional inquiries. For witnesses that might prove problematic, the chairman of the panel, Bennie Thompson, has moved to issue automatic subpoenas compelling documents and testimony, often before committee counsel has taken the customary step of first requesting voluntary cooperation. At the same time, the select committee has taken a broad view of its mandate: to investigate whether there was any coordination between the “political elements” of Trump’s plan to obstruct the certification of Biden’s election win in addition to the Capitol attack itself. That has increased the panel’s workload and pushed back the timeline, Thompson told the Guardian on Monday, though he said he still hoped for public hearings in April. “We keep adding to the list of people we need to talk to. That’s grown the body of work,” he said.",News/US news,Keyword list for Trump lawyer hints at focus of US Capitol attack investigation,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/02/us-capitol-attack-john-eastman-keyword-list
3/2/2022,"“Every shopper in the UK” will have access to refillable groceries in a large supermarket or with a delivery service under plans by some of the country’s biggest grocers. Waitrose, Ocado, Morrisons, Marks & Spencer and the supply-chain company CHEP have joined a refillable grocery partnership and plan to both roll out unpackaged options in-store as well as letting people fill containers with essentials during home deliveries. These grocers are part of the Refill Coalition group, run by Unpackaged, a company that runs refill stations in stores including Planet Organic and in some independent local farm shops. The supermarkets plan to start the rollout by the end of the year. Supermarkets are starting their refill lines with dry goods such as pasta, rice, cereals, seeds, grains, nuts and dried fruits; and will also offer household and personal care products such as washing-up liquid, laundry liquid, shampoo, and handwash. There are 56.5bn units of single-use plastic packaging sold annually in the UK, according to Greenpeace. About 99% of plastic packaging is also made from fossil fuels. Catherine Conway, the founder of Unpackaged said: “Working together to create a universal system gives us the best chance of scaling refills so they become accessible to every shopper in the UK, as we know consumers want less single-use plastic packaging on the items they buy. “An industry-wide approach will lead to a refill system that works for everyone in the supply chain and will make refilling easier for shoppers.” Supermarkets including Waitrose and M&S are trialling some refill stations in a handful of branches. The consumer group Which? found that items in the scheme were on average about 10-15% cheaper when loose. M&S, Morrisons, Ocado, Waitrose & Partners and CHEP said in a joint statement: “We’re delighted to be joining forces with the mutual objective of reducing single-use plastic packaging. The universal end-to-end solution being developed by the Refill Coalition presents a landmark opportunity for us to make a step change in the commercialisation of refills which we know can play a significant role in the reduction of single-use plastic packaging.” Conway added: “This is the first step towards the fundamental removal of large quantities of single-use plastic packaging from regular grocery shopping – if we can make refills more available and affordable for shoppers, I am in no doubt that this will become a commonplace way of shopping in the future across all retailers, in the UK and farther afield.”",News/Environment,Refillable groceries to be made available to every UK shopper,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/02/refillable-groceries-uk-shopper-waitrose-morrisons-refill-stations-plastic-waste
3/2/2022,"Maybe there is always something in Abel Ferrara ’s work that always has to be indulged; his recent work anyway. I was initially unsure what on earth to make of this new film: it’s an experimental moodscape, murky and grainy, apparently made under lockdown conditions in his adopted city of Rome (a fever-dream of lockdown perhaps) shooting largely at night in what looks like a covert guerrilla-style way. The film is topped and tailed with weird “prologue” and “epilogue” pieces to camera by its star Ethan Hawke, appearing ambiguously and semi-fictionally as himself, discussing the film, the director and whether to feel optimistic or pessimistic about life. On paper, this could be a conventional thriller, but it’s more like the confused dream you might have after watching a conventional thriller. Hawke plays an American special forces soldier, or possibly an expatriate American mercenary, operating in Rome as part of some anti-terrorist unit. He also plays his own twin brother, a radical leftist revolutionary held captive somewhere, who rails against his oppressors, quoting Woody Guthrie: “This machine kills fascists!” The soldier is also mixed up with some sinister cabal of Russian oligarchs who have a hold over him (a glimpse of a magazine photograph hints that both brothers were acquainted with them in days gone by) and a truly strange sequence shows him being forced to have sex with one of the women so she can have a baby. The terrorists themselves succeed in blowing up various Rome monuments, the occasion for some bargain-basement CGI work. There are Christian metaphors and a quotation from St Francis: “The world is the hiding place of God.” This film may stretch your patience to the limit and beyond. It’s minor work – but there is always something there, some restless wounded intelligence, a pugnacious worrying-away at something. Ferrara is muddled, incoherent, but also strangely concerned to make sense of – or just acknowledge – the pain and anxiety of our lives.  Zeros and Ones is released on 7 March on digital platforms.",Arts/Film,Zeros and Ones review – Abel Ferrara’s dream-like thriller struggles to make sense,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/02/zeros-and-ones-review-ethan-hawke-abel-ferrara
3/2/2022,"The HPV vaccine is leading to such dramatic reductions in cervical cancer that those who receive it may only need one smear test in their lives, according to a leading cancer prevention scientist. The academic director of King’s Clinical Trials Unit, Prof Peter Sasieni, said the screening programme – which currently needs to be performed every three to five years – could soon change due to the encouraging results from the new HPV vaccine. He told BBC Radio 4: “This is really exciting.... [The HPV vaccine] protects against even more types of the virus, and I think with that probably one screen would be enough, maybe two, over a lifetime.” In the meantime, Cancer Research UK is still urging people to come forward for screening. Research suggests nearly all cases of cervical cancer are caused by human papillomaviruses – known as HPV – and there are more than 100 types. As the virus is spread by intimate skin-to-skin contact, the vaccine is ideally given before a person becomes sexually active. Cervical cancer develops when abnormal cells in the cervix – the neck of the womb that is connected to the vagina – grow out of control. The disease is the second most common cancer among women under the age of 35 in England; figures from 2019 suggest two women in England die every day from the disease. The development of vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV) has prevented thousands of people from developing the disease or pre-cancers. However, the jabs are free only in England under the universal programme for under-25s, and the vaccines do not prevent all cases of cervical cancer: even those who have had the jabs still need to go for screening when invited.",News/Society,"HPV vaccine recipients may only need one smear test in their lives, expert says",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/02/hpv-vaccine-recipients-may-only-need-one-smear-test-in-their-lives-expert-says
