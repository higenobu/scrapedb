2/14/2022,"Eddie Jones believes there is no limit to Marcus Smith’s potential after the England fly-half inspired his side to a comfortable 33-0 victory against Italy in Rome. Jones’s side failed to ruthlessly thrash Italy as he had urged them to but Smith was the standout performer, scoring the first try and delivering another fine showing in England colours. He finished with 13 points and his second try of the championship after exchanging passes with Max Malins, with whom he dovetailed impressively throughout. Last week Smith was replaced against Scotland with 17 minutes remaining when England led by seven points – his withdrawal coinciding with England’s capitulation.  “There’s no ceiling to how good he can be,” said Jones. “If he keeps on wanting to get better, keeps having a learning mindset, he could be an absolutely outstanding player at Test level by the World Cup. And obviously that’s pretty important, to have a good 10.” Jones was largely satisfied with the performance, which plateaued for long spells of the second half before Kyle Sinckler added the fifth try. England also kept Italy scoreless for the first time in the Six Nations. “You always want more,” Jones said. “You always want a few more sparklers, a few more rockets. But we went out with the strong intent of taking the game to Italy and not allowing them into the game. I think we did that but we’d have liked to have finished a few more of the rockets at the end that we didn’t get.” England’s bonus-point victory moves them to second in the Six Nations table with back-to-back matches at Twickenham to come against Wales and Ireland, but Smith echoed Jones’s view that there is room for improvement. “I thought in parts we were good, but we’re all striving for perfection,” he said. “We’re not satisfied at the minute. But to come away with five points in this tournament is always nice.” Jones was tight-lipped on the incident that saw Jack Nowell withdrawn for a head injury assessment – which the Exeter winger failed – in the first half. The referee Damon Murphy came in for criticism amid claims he appeared to hastily restart play. Nowell was taken off soon after, just 16 minutes into his first England start for three years. The incident comes after an England doctor came in for criticism for how a head injury to Deago Bailey was handled in the under-20s side’s defeat on Friday. But Jones said: “I don’t have any understanding. I am told if he can play or not and if he can’t I’ll make a replacement.”",Sport/Sport,"There is no ceiling to how good Marcus Smith can be, says Eddie Jones",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/13/six-nations-rugby-england-italy-no-ceiling-marcus-smith-eddie-jones

2/14/2022,"David Moyes insisted Kurt Zouma pulled out of West Ham United’s 2-2 draw with Leicester City less than half an hour before kick-off with sickness rather than stress. The West Ham manager said he had lined up Issa Diop to deputise after Zouma came down ill overnight after a week in which the defender was fined £250,000 for kicking his cat in a video posted on social media. The RSPCA is investigating the incident.  Moyes said he excluded the defender from the pre-match team meeting before naming him in his starting lineup for a game West Ham drew 2-2 thanks to Craig Dawson’s stoppage-time equaliser. Moyes said Zouma was “desperate to play” but that after taking part in the warm-up here – during which he was booed by Leicester fans – he had to withdraw. “[Diop] was made aware he had a chance of playing because Kurt was not well last night and was sick during the night and did not eat with us today and stayed out of the meeting,” said Moyes, who expects Zouma to be available next weekend. “We did that not because we were worried, just in case it was a Covid symptom. But it has been sickness and he just could not make it.” Moyes had been widely criticised for selecting Zouma last Tuesday, for the 1-0 win over Watford, shortly after the video had gone viral. But the manager said he could not hear as the visiting fans chanted their support of Zouma with tongue-in-cheek comments here. “I have hard-enough hearing at my age never mind hearing what the fans are shouting,” he said. West Ham stay fourth but with Manchester United held 1-1 by Southampton on Saturday and Tottenham losing 2-0 at home to Wolves on Sunday, Arsenal were arguably the big winners among the teams chasing Champions League qualification, even though they did not play. Mikel Arteta’s side sit two points behind West Ham with three games in hand. Jarrad Bowen had given West Ham the lead with his seventh goal in his last seven games, before Youri Tielemans’ penalty and Ricardo Pereira scored for Leicester, and Moyes hopes that a slight shin injury will not keep him out. “He is certainly coming up with the goals for us and we need him at the moment,” Moyes said.",Sport/Football,Moyes insists Zouma missed West Ham game due to sickness not stress,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/13/moyes-insists-zouma-missed-west-ham-game-due-to-sickness-not-stress
