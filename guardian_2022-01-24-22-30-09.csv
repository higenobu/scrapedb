1/24/2022,"“We have to make sure,” said Tayfun Korkut, “that we put this week behind us and focus on the coming games.” Hertha were always going to have to put their experience against Bayern to one side – 109 seconds into Sunday’s game Corentin Tolisso had the ball in the net and was called for a marginal offside, and even before the midfielder eventually headed the opener it never felt like the home side were doing anything other than trying to contain the deluge in a paper cup, as Neil Finn might have said – but the coach meant more than just that. It is the whole week, rather than just the habitual ordeal against the Rekordmeister, that the club from the capital will aim to forget. It will be hard to do so. Underpinned by a DfB Pokal loss, also at Olympiastadion but against Union Berlin, a defeat that not only snuffed out any flickering hope of some joy being extracted from this miserable season but “consolidated their [Union’s] title as city champions,” as Berliner Morgenpost’s Jorn Lange wrote on Thursday, it has been horrible. “You can’t make amends for a derby with the next game, even if it’s [against] Bayern,” recognised Korkut and though he insisted “I know how to beat them,” having won handsomely as Stuttgart coach at Allianz Arena on the final day of 2017-18 with Jupp Heynckes’ side long since champions, it was never going to be about producing an improbable result that was never truly on the cards.  Many fans had simply had enough and the reverse to Union, with Hertha flattered by the 3-2 score lent a sheen by Suat Serdar’s very late consolation, was the straw that broke the camel’s back. On Thursday a banner with “Schande!” (Disgrace!) printed on it hung on the fence outside the Olympiastadion complex. By Saturday that had escalated into face-to-face complaint, with some 80 fans interrupting a behind-closed-doors training session to make their feelings clear to the players. The police were called, but didn’t need to intervene in the end. As bad were the reports from Business Insider detailing investigations into the businesses of major investor Lars Windhorst – who has spent nearly €400 million in attempts to improve the team – and suspected involvement with a convicted money launderer from the UAE (Windhorst’s lawyer has refuted any deliberate involvement from his client). Despite Windhorst’s outlay resulting in little success, any pressure on him is extra, unwelcome pressure on the club. On the pitch Hertha are a combination of good ideas and terrible ones, of long-term plans and short-term panic. Their desire to build around young players like Márton Dárdai (19 years old) and Linus Gechter (17) and solid older pros is laudable, but some of the experienced ones like Stevan Jovetic and Kevin-Prince Boateng can’t be trusted to be fit and others simply aren’t good enough. With a lack of leadership on the sidelines, it leaves Hertha looking like a mess. “I have to say that there wasn’t really any defending for my goal,” Thomas Müller remarked with typical candour at being left alone to nudge in Joshua Kimmich’s free-kick on the cusp of half-time, and although there was a suggestion that the phantom whistler of the Olympiastadion striking again had led the defence to stop (the stadium’s announcer Fabian von Wachsmann made an appeal for the individual to refrain from doing so), the third goal that finally finished the game was a ledge beneath the edge – Alexander Schwolow’s pass in the approximate direction of Gechter got nowhere near the youngster and just provided Leroy Sané with a tap-in. Serge Gnabry’s fourth compounded the misery. The appointment of Fredi Bobic should have been the first step towards a credible sporting project, but it is remarkable that despite installing a leader with vision and having funds available, hope is in very short supply. “I’ve been a Hertha member since I was eight years old,” wrote Florian Comtesse in Monday’s Bild, “and I’ve been through two relegations, but I’ve never been as disappointed as I am right now. I’m so tired of Hertha at the moment.” With so many teams with issues in the relegation scrap Hertha might be able to survive without genuine improvement – but it’s reached the point where that is no longer an option. Eintracht Franfurt 0-2 Arminia Bielefeld, Bochum 2-2 Cologne, Freiburg 2-0 Stuttgart, Mönchengladbach 1-2 Union Berlin, Hoffenheim 2-3 Borussia Dortmund, Greuther Furth 2-1 Mainz, Bayer Leverkusen 5-1 Augsburg, Hertha Berlin 1-4 Bayern Munich, Leipzig 2-0 Wolfsburg  Dortmund tightened their grip on second place with an impressive 3-2 win at Hoffenheim – impressive not in that BVB dominated, but in their ability to minimise profligacy at either end of the pitch. Home coach Sebastian Hoeness spoke of Dortmund’s two goals to quell his team’s surge at the start of the second half (a Marco Reus strike and a David Raum own goal) as being “in the style of a top team,” and this felt far more controlled from Marco Rose’s side, with Donyell Malen shining and laying on all three goals.  It wasn’t all great for BVB though, with Erling Haaland withdrawn in clear discomfort having opened the scoring, a thigh muscle injury looking the likely cause. The Bundesliga’s short hiatus is probably well-timed. “The break is not inconvenient for us,” noted Rose.  Another team licking their wounds from Pokal troubles were Borussia Mönchengladbach, but maybe their humiliating midweek elimination at second-tier Hannover wasn’t the nadir of their week as they were beaten at home again, this time by Union. Any side that scores a team goal of the quality of Manu Koné’s equaliser really shouldn’t be anywhere near the foot of the table – but there they are, held back by the desperate form of forwards Alessane Pléa and Marcus Thuram, questionable defending and a difficult-to-discern philosophy. Bild reported on Sunday that Adi Hütter will be given the 14-day break to “finally inject his ideas into the team” – not least because he would be very expensive to fire, one assumes. The gloom was accentuated by modest Union’s win helping them crack the top four on the back of an expertly taken brace by former Gladbach star Max Kruse.  It’s now two points from the last nine Bundesliga games for Wolfsburg (11 winless overall) after Sunday’s defeat at Leipzig, who are slowly creeping up on the top four under Domenico Tedesco. It is thought that Die Wölfe, like Gladbach, will hang fire on the future of Florian Kohfeldt (who praised his side for a “really good performance” despite the loss), though he must surely beat bottom side Greuther Fürth next time out to continue.  Can we call Fürth in form? They bagged a second win of the season on Saturday, over Mainz, both achieved in the last six Bundesliga games, a space of time in which they’ve only lost once. Stefan Leitl’s team are still nine points adrift of third-bottom, the relegation play-off spot, but there is momentum there – and confidence, as shown by Jeremy Dudziak’s delightful finish for the opener. “We’ll just see where the journey goes,” said an increasingly confident Leitl.  Leverkusen continue in third after hammering Augsburg 5-1, with Moussa Diaby hitting a sublime hat-trick. It was also a good weekend off the pitch as the club announced the signing of prolific Iranian striker Sardar Azmoun, who will arrive on a free from Zenit St Petersburg in the summer.",Sport/Football,Hertha Berlin go missing in Bayern ordeal to complete week of ‘disgrace’ | Andy Brassell,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/24/hertha-berlin-go-missing-in-bayern-ordeal-to-complete-week-of-disgrace
1/24/2022,"A video obtained by the Guardian appearing to show Egyptian police torturing detainees in a Cairo police station confirms the extent to which officers appear able to inflict violence on civilians with near total impunity, according to human rights groups. The video, covertly recorded by a detainee through a cell door, appears to show two inmates hung in stress positions. The detainees are naked from the waist up and suspended from a metal grate by their arms, which are fastened behind their backs.  “Watch how they are torturing us and our colleagues. They came and told us we’re next,” one detainee says. Addressing the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi he says: “Mister president, we want to ask why the police in el-Salam First police station are doing this to us.” The video is one of two believed to have been recorded in November last year inside a police station in the working-class el-Salam neighbourhood of northern Cairo. In the second, which the Guardian is not showing to protect detainees’ identities, inmates in an overcrowded cell line up to display injuries they say were inflicted by police officials and investigators, including open wounds on their heads and bruises across their chests and backs. “They are hitting us with sticks,” they say. Humans rights groups said the videos are visual evidence of widespread abuses that they have been documenting in police stations and detention centres across Egypt for the past decade. The Guardian has taken steps to verify the videos where possible, including requesting an assessment of the videos by a trusted expert. Detainees shown in the video also name multiple police officers who are listed in news reports as serving at el-Salam First police station. The videos surfaced nearly 12 years after the death of Khaled Said, a 28-year-old civilian, in police custody in Alexandria in June 2010. Said’s death proved to be a watershed, inciting public anger at the impunity of security forces and their treatment of Egyptian citizens, and sparking the protests that began on 25 January 2011, a national day traditionally honouring the police force. The 18 days of nationwide protests that followed ended the decades-long reign of autocrat Hosni Mubarak, where abuses by security bodies were widespread. Yet 11 years after the uprising, testimonies and evidence collected by rights groups allege that abuses by Egypt’s security services are once again out of control. Since coming to power after a military coup in 2013, Sisi has presided over a renewed era of impunity for security forces, down to the lowest ranks of the police. Despite a clear prohibition on all forms of torture in Egypt’s 2014 constitution, trials and convictions of security officials for torture or deaths in custody remain extremely rare, while abuses are regularly documented. Domestic organisations monitoring torture and abuse in detention now struggle to continue their work, amid a prolonged crackdown on civil society activity. “Police stations are even worse than prisons,” said Aly Hussin Mahdy, a former detainee and now exiled activist, describing his experience in detention. “The revolution happened because of this, and 11 years later we see it happening again.” Amr Magdi, an expert on Egypt at Human Rights Watch who reviewed the videos for the Guardian, said that the detainees’ injuries and the use of stress positions are consistent with documented examples of torture in detention centres. “They all show signs of severe beatings, and they mention batons and wooden sticks which are routine torture tools,” he said. “These videos show the sad and horrifying reality of Egypt’s detention system as the police enjoy near-absolute impunity.” Magdi said that abuse was common in police stations, where mistreatment can occur away from public view. “We know that most physical torture happens in police stations and secret NSA [National Security Agency] detention centres during the initial days or weeks after arrest, and before detainees are taken to larger prisons,” he said. Human Rights Watch detailed the use of stress positions and the systemic use of torture in police stations in a report in 2017, describing the issue as a potential crime against humanity. The report cites 19 individual cases where detainees “were tortured in police stations and national security offices across the country, including Alexandria, Aswan, and cities in the Nile delta”. For some, torture occurred in multiple places of detention. “The basic tools of torture were electrocution and stress positions, accompanied by beatings with fists, wooden sticks or metal bars,” they said. Police and NSA officers “handcuffed suspects’ arms behind their back, pulled up their arms, placed their handcuffs over the top edge of a door, and hung them above the floor, an unnatural position that caused excruciating pain in the back and shoulders, sometimes dislocating them. Some officers pulled suspects’ legs downward to increase the pain,” they said. They added that detainees were often left in stress positions for long periods. Rights groups have also documented frequent deaths among those detained. In 2015, Amnesty International provided evidence of at least nine deaths in custody in the Mattareya police station in Cairo. Three years later, it demanded an investigation after the suspicious death of 43-year-old Gamal Aweida in custody in the Mansheyet Nasir district of the city. In rare cases of accountability, a small number of police officers have been sentenced for shooting civilians in public over the past decade. In 2016, Sisi publicly instructed the interior ministry to prevent abuses by police following an outcry after an officer shot dead a taxi driver. Last year, a police officer from the al-Salam Second police station was sentenced to three years in prison with hard labour for shooting a civilian in the chest and wounding another. Yet convictions for deaths in custody are rare, even for low-ranking police officers. Four noncommissioned officers were imprisoned by prosecutors in 2020 for torturing a man to death at a police station in Giza. In December 2020, nine police officers were sentenced to three years in prison for beating a street vendor to death in custody in Cairo in 2016. The Egypt State Information Service, interior ministry, and current and former officials at the interior ministry either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment when contacted by the Guardian to discuss video evidence of abuses and the issue of torture in police custody.

1/24/2022,"The Metropolitan police has apologised and paid compensation to an academic for “sexist, derogatory and unacceptable language” used by officers about her when she was strip-searched. “What’s that smell? Oh, it’s her knickers,” officers at a north-east London police station said to each other after Dr Konstancja Duff was held down on the floor and her clothes cut off. “Is she rank?” another said.  The Met apologised to Duff, anassistant professor of philosophy at the University of Nottingham, after CCTV video capturing the officers’ conversations was disclosed to her as part of a civil action against the force. Insp Andy O’Donnell, of the Met’s directorate of professional standards, told her: “I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely and unreservedly apologise for the sexist, derogatory and unacceptable language used about you and for any upset and distress this may have caused. “I hope that settlement of this claim and this recognition of the impact of what happened that day will enable you to put this incident behind you.” Duff said: “In every detail the footage backed up what I had said in my statements for years and years.” Officers had claimed they had acted with professionalism, strip-searching her for her own safety because she would not give them her name. “There was such a barrage of misinformation that they put out that I actually, even though I was there and I knew that it was false, had almost started to doubt myself,” she said. “It was such an effective gaslighting: ‘We were just concerned for your mental health, that was why we had to – for your own good – forcibly strip you naked and mash you up.’ “It was so obviously not what they were doing at the time. They were doing it as punishment, they were doing it as intimidation, they wanted to soften me up and get my details.” Duff was arrested on 5 May 2013 on suspicion of obstructing and assaulting police after trying to hand a legal advice card to a 15-year-old caught in a stop-and-search sweep in Hackney – allegations she was later cleared of in court. She was taken to Stoke Newington police station, where Sgt Kurtis Howard, in charge of the custody area, ordered the search when she refused to cooperate with officers. In 2017 Howard appeared before a disciplinary panel, which cleared him of gross misconduct. He argued the search was necessary to assess any risk Duff might pose to herself, and its chair concluded his actions were those of a responsible officer. The CCTV footage now obtained by Duff of the police station custody area on the day she was searched shows Howard telling officers to show her “resistance is futile” and to search her “by any means necessary”. “Treat her like a terrorist,” he says. “I don’t care.” In a cell, three female officers bound Duff by her hands and feet, pinned her to the floor and cut her clothes off with scissors. Duff described the ordeal, which left her with a number of visible injuries, as like a sexual assault. The CCTV footage then shows the officers who searched Duff returning to the reception. A male officer asks them: “Didn’t find anything untoward on her, ladies?” “A lot of hair,” one of the female officers replies. The others laugh. About a minute later, as two male officers go through Duff’s possessions, one asks in mock alarm: “Sorry, sorry, what’s that smell?” “Oh, it’s her knickers, yeah?” his colleague replies. A female officer then returns again from handling Duff. “Ugh, I feel disgusting; I’m going to need a shower,” she says. “You need defumigating,” a male officer tells her. Another female officer asks her: “Is she rank?” “No, she’s not actually,” she says. “She is, her clothes stink,” another male officer says. “Is it? Her body isn’t,” she replies. The Met did not say whether any officers had faced disciplinary action, but said allegations of misconduct relating to the comments had been referred to its professional standards directorate. “This investigation remains ongoing,” it said. But Duff said individual officers were not the issue. She said the exchanges shown in the CCTV exposed “the culture of sexualised mockery, the dehumanising attitude” shown during her strip-search. Officers’ taunts of her in the cell, out of view of CCTV, were worse than those captured on camera, she said. “The crucial issue is that racism, misogyny [and] sexual violence, are normalised in policing,” said Duff, who has written widely on the politics of police abolition. “And the way in which they treated me, the fact that’s normal is shown by the way that at every level of the system it was rubber-stamped for eight years. “Because the scrutiny is always placed on the person who has been subject to violent policing, looking for something about them which means that they deserved it. Any way in which you have not complied, or you have stood up to them, or you have resisted, is taken as a justification for an escalation of force and violence against you.” Duff’s case has come to light as the Met finds itself under the spotlight for what critics have described as a culture of institutional misogyny. The rape and murder of Sarah Everard by a Met firearms officer, prosecutions of serving officers for rape, and revelations of sexist and racist online chats between officers have led to renewed questions about sexism in the force. In October, the Met brought in the former Whitehall troubleshooter Louise Casey to investigate why leaders had so far failed to solve the problem.",News/UK news,"Met apologises to woman for ‘sexist, derogatory’ language during strip-search",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/24/met-apologises-to-academic-for-sexist-derogatory-language
1/24/2022,"Eating game, particularly that managed by the British Game Alliance, is a brilliant way to protect ecosystems and natural habitats, and support good animal welfare. Game can make the most delicious feasts, adding wonderful flavour and goodness to curries, pilaus, roasts and stir-fries. I also love that it is so healthy, being higher in protein and micronutrients than anything reared indoors.  I particularly love the mild, sweet flavour of partridge (when in season), but this dish also works wonderfully with quail or jointed chicken. Prep 15 minCook 45 minServes 4 1kg floury potatoes, peeled and cut into small chunks7 tbsp olive oil1 tbsp coriander seeds1 tbsp cumin seeds½ tsp black peppercorns1 whole Kashmiri chilli, or ½ tsp chilli flakesSeeds from 4 green cardamom pods1 clove2 bay leaves½ tsp ground cinnamon4 partridges, or 4-8 quail, depending on appetite, or 8 chicken quarters, thighs and/or drumsticksLemon wedges, to serve For the raita300g Greek yoghurt1 small garlic clove, peeled½ cucumber1 small handful mint leaves, chopped Ask your butcher to spatchcock the birds, or do it yourself by cutting out the backbone, then putting the birds breast side up on a board and pushing down to flatten them out. Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Pop the potatoes in a large baking tray, pour over five tablespoons of the olive oil, season generously and toss with your hands to coat. Roast for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, blitz the whole spices and bay leaves to a powder in a small spice grinder (or grind them in a mortar). Transfer to a large bowl, stir in the cinnamon and remaining two tablespoons of oil, then add the birds, season and rub the spice paste all over the birds, so they’re well coated in the aromatics – they will be smelling delicious by now. Once the potatoes have done their 30 minutes, lay the birds skin side up on top, then roast for 15 minutes, or until the birds are just cooked through – they are much better served slightly pink and tender; overcooking dries out game because of its low fat content. Transfer the birds to a plate, cover with foil and leave to rest in a warm spot for five to 10 minutes. In the meantime, the potatoes will get even more of an opportunity to crisp up in the oven. To make the raita, spoon the yoghurt into a bowl, grate in the garlic and cucumber, stir in the mint and season to taste. Serve the roast birds with the hot potatoes, the raita, lemon wedges and perhaps a crisp, green salad on the side. For a veggie version, toss the potatoes in half the spices and roast as above. Sweat a large sliced onion with the rest of the spices, stir in some peas, toss into the potatoes and serve in flatbreads with the raita.

1/24/2022,"A pufferfish had to undergo emergency dental work after her teeth grew so big she was unable to eat. The owner of Goldie the porcupine pufferfish, Mark Byatt, 64, rushed her to the vets in Kent after noticing she was losing weight because her long teeth prevented her from eating properly.  Medics at Sandhole Veterinary Centre in Snodland, Kent, confirmed the five-year-old pufferfish’s teeth needed to be sawed down. They sedated her using a water bowl filled with a mild anaesthetic solution, so they could cut off one inch from her teeth. The veterinary surgeon Daniel Calvo Carrasco, who specialises in caring for exotic pets, said: “Porcupine pufferfish teeth are known as beaks and grow continuously throughout their lives. “They’re usually kept short naturally, as they’re worn down on their regular diet of hard-shelled foods, but, while these foods are provided in her home environment, she is not as forthcoming in eating them as her other tankmates. “As a result, her upper beak grew to the point where it was hindering her ability to eat effectively.” To calm Goldie during the procedure, the water was kept well oxygenated. “This meant she was still breathing nicely throughout, but was able to be held for brief periods out of the water without becoming too stressed,” Carrasco said. The veterinary nurse Debbie Addison held Goldie in a damp towel to prevent her from drying out – and provide a layer of protection if Goldie’s “puff up” defensive mode is activated. When they feel threatened or distressed, pufferfish can inflate to double their size to deter predators. Carrasco said it was during those brief periods out of the anaesthetic water when he could use a dental bur – a tool often made from diamond for cutting bone or teeth – to saw off half her upper beak. Once the hour-long procedure was over, Goldie was moved to another large bowl filled with water from her home tank to recover from the anaesthetic. “She responded well and there was no stress at all,” said Carrasco. “Within five minutes, she was able to stay up right in the water and within 10 minutes she was back to happily swimming around. Goldie was back home and eating well within two hours.” Goldie is now well settled back home in her tank in Leybourne, much to the relief of her owner. Byatt said: “About three months ago, we noticed her front beak was growing very quickly, even though she was eating cockle in shell every day. “We aren’t sure why Goldie’s teeth never really managed to grind themselves naturally, but we knew we needed to get them filed, although we were unsure about how to achieve this.” He said he was initially unsure about transporting the tropical fish to the surgery due to the risks involved. “We’re just thrilled to have Goldie back home. She is thriving back in her tank and none the worse for her visit to the dentist.’",News/World news,Long in the tooth: Goldie the pufferfish has emergency dental work,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/24/long-in-the-tooth-goldie-the-pufferfish-has-emergency-dental-work
1/24/2022,"I wasn’t always a boring eater. I used to have a slightly crackpot reputation among friends and family for ordering the weirdest thing on the menu in a restaurant. And yet I have had to reconcile myself to the fact that I’ve basically bottomed out as a meat and two veg guy. Sure, on the extremely rare occasions that I eat out, I’ll probably have something wild just so I can briefly feel alive again. But 99% of my meals are eaten at home, generally cooked by me, and with two fussy kids and a partner who responds with visceral horror any time I suggest we might try Polish cuisine (which is more like three meats and some cabbage), the good ol’ meat and two veg tends to win.  It’s such a depressing-sounding phrase – like you’ve given up on life, like you’re simply spooning down drably uniform food units as you go about your tedious little day, too starved of inspiration to even attempt to respond to culinary developments of recent years. As plant-based eating becomes increasingly popular – and offers an ever-expanding array of options – meat and two veg remains obstinately rooted in the British psyche. But life, and food, have moved on. I don’t want to be too down on it. For starters: two veg – that’s pretty good, right? We’re talking about doing some solid damage to our five-a-day here. OK, in my house it’s often fairly unadventurous boiled things that won’t offend a six-year-old, but you don’t get more plant-based than a vegetable. “Meat” – well, it can cover a whole spectrum of possibilities: chicken! Beef! Vaguely avant garde sausages from our local sausage shop! It would be a struggle to paint a meat and two veg lifestyle as particularly sexy, but you can’t believe the endorphin rush that comes from persuading a small person to eat food that isn’t covered in breadcrumbs and processed to within an inch of its life. If you don’t screw up the cooking of what is basically food that’s very easy to cook, then meat is nice! That’s why people eat it. And you can be kind of ethical about the meat you choose, too: free-range chicken, grass-fed, organic lamb, avoid beef with a connection to deforestation in Latin America … Yes, it’s worse for the environment than simply not eating meat at all, but to eat meat and two veg is not to say I don’t care. Yet, I am well aware this way of eating is out of date, a feeling exacerbated for me by the fact that my day job involves working with a lot of cool younger people. They talk about individual dishes in specific London restaurants the way I used to talk about the latest single from a mid-2000s indie band. And where back in my day vegans were regarded as a sort of extremist vegetarian sect who ate their own, peculiar, nut-based cuisine, now veganism seems to have leapfrogged vegetarianism in terms of popularity – people go to vegan restaurants because they’re cool, because they’ve heard about some amazing new dish, because of colossal advances in food technology, because of increased open-mindedness about food, because of the increased internationalism in cuisine and, naturally, a desire to consume food in a more healthy, environmentally-friendly way. People go to vegan restaurants without even being actual vegans. Is it time for Łukowski to replace his sausages … Nonetheless, is it for me? For a long time, I’ve worried that nouveaux veganism is so cool that my dabbling with it would have the air of a midlife crisis. Is embracing veganism at the age of 40 the culinary equivalent of Ben Affleck getting a new tattoo? But recently it has become so obvious that the wind is blowing in a certain direction – there’s now a plant-based section in Tesco – that I’ve realised I’ve probably been overthinking it. Ultimately, the world is changing: in my lifetime meat might become scarcer, or more expensive, or beyond the ethical pale, or grown in a vat, or replaced with insect protein. I have made my peace with the fact that, at some point, my diet will have to change. So why not introduce some more plant-based foods into my already two-thirds plant-based diet? The need to appease my children has always been an excuse for lack of action, but the rise of faux meat is actually the perfect opportunity to pep up family mealtimes, be it from the now bewildering array of plant-based sausages available, to kievs, escalopes, and even fake bacon (that one’s a bit weird, to be honest). … with a plant-based alternative? I’m not sure I’m ready for the really cutting-edge stuff, and meat is unlikely to leave my diet. I need to give the kids something to rebel against when they’re older and go fully plant-based themselves. But, for now, yes, I’m a meat and two veg guy. But sometimes I’m also a fake meat and two veg guy. And that’s what we call progress. Looking for dietary advice from a puppet? Watch THE NEW NORM&AL SHOW. Season 1 streaming now.

1/24/2022,"Food is a serious business in my family. Whenever I visit my aunt I’m always reminded of the scene from My Big Fat Greek Wedding where the fiance is revealed to be vegetarian: “What do you mean, you don’t eat no meat? That’s OK, I make lamb.” For her, the idea of a plate without meat on it makes no sense, and she is always trying to sneak something on, claiming “a little won’t hurt”. So I came prepared for my first family barbecue as a vegan. This was long before the days of Beyond Burger, so I opted for spicy jerk-seasoned portobello mushrooms and peppers, Creole spiced sweet potatoes and smoky carrot hotdogs. OK, smoky carrot hotdogs may sound abysmal, but I promise you they’re magic when done right. I prepared them the night before, marinating every inch, and was really excited to eat, drink and catch up with my cousins. My uncle was at the grill, babysitting sausages, burgers and chicken thighs, and I proudly walked up to him with my vegetables to inquire when I could get them on.  He looked from me to the plate in my hand and back again, and threw back his head in booming laughter. One by one, everyone at the barbecue gathered round my plate of vegetables in hysterics, and I heard: “Is that rabbit food really all you’re going to eat?” amid bursts of derisive laughter. My journey to fully plant-based eating has been a marathon, not a sprint. My teenage social life revolved around south London chicken shops (Morley’s, please holla at your girl so we can develop a plant-based menu – I’m waiting). I referred to myself as a “chicken-eating pescatarian”, which isn’t actually a thing, and remember being horrified when a close friend told me she was contemplating becoming vegan. “But why?! It seems so miserable. Just go veggie. You’re being so extra.” Two years later, I was on holiday in Ecuador with a mouthful of roast guinea pig – cuy, a speciality – when I was suddenly struck by the fact that I was eating the flesh of an animal. Obviously I’d been aware I was eating animals before, but tucking in to guinea pig – in my mind a pet – was different. I realised the word “meat” disconnected me from that reality – flesh is so much more visceral. I committed to veganism, and in my first year of university I had Meat-Free Monday nights for my halls of residence, making amazing, budget-friendly meals with friends. These Monday sessions were the blueprint for my food business Sister Woman Vegan, and helped me to get creative and confident with plant-based cooking. I made everything from pie and mash to curries and lasagne, as well as my signature soul food and traditional Jamaican dishes. I realised the impact of these sessions at my birthday dinner when the entire table ordered something plant-based – I thought they were doing it for my benefit, but after a year of trying vegan cooking they actually thought the veg options sounded more tasty. My favourite food to make for friends now is my annual friendsmas meal – the staples are perfect roast potatoes, musician Jme-approved mac and cheese and my vegan oxtail substitute. This meal would absolutely make any committed carnivore feel that they don’t need meat – it’s all about flavour and texture. Honest Burgers’ plant burger has me covered if I ever need a proper meaty fix, but I do crave seafood sometimes – a vegan calamari recipe using king oyster mushrooms and seaweed was one of the first recipes I perfected. ‘Many of my private catering clients aren’t vegan, they just appreciate plant-based cooking,’ says Robinson Being Black, plus-size and vegan is extremely interesting as I don’t fit into the assumed mold. A lot of people didn’t understand that veganism has little to do with health or clean eating and assumed I was trying to lose weight. While I did lose some, the biggest impact in terms of health was reevaluating my relationship with food. I had to be intentional rather than passive, which meant I was really aware of everything I was consuming. Vegan spaces are still considerably whitewashed and, at times, flat out racist. When I first became vegan, a popular vegan platform tweeted: “Black Lives Matter? More than chickens’ or cows’ lives … apparently”, amid protests in the US after the police shooting of Michael Brown in 2014. This was one reason I set up the Black Vegan Fest in February 2021; the other being the fact that Black people in the UK suffer disproportionately from food-related illnesses. I wanted to champion Black plant-based businesses and encourage my community to become plant-based. We are lucky now to have a plethora of Black-centred vegan platforms, sharing veganised traditional cultural dishes and advice, but they were rare when I first became vegan. Now, I no longer feel that my cultural identity and my choice to not eat meat are at odds. Plant-based eating is more normal, and I absolutely love it. Two of my cousins are vegetarian, and my aunt called me up to (lovingly) shout at me for brainwashing her household – and to ask for recipes. Many of my private catering clients aren’t vegan, they just appreciate plant-based cooking. The popularity of plant-based eating has changed my relationship with veganism. I identify less with that label and I’m much less militant – veganism and its followers aren’t morally superior to any other way of eating, especially if they fail to focus on eating local and limiting food waste. Sister Woman Vegan’s spinach and mushroom carbonara The biggest thing I miss about no longer being “that weirdo vegan” is that my vegan alternatives used to always be affordable and available. It feels as if there’s now a “vegan tax” on niche products such as ackee, jackfruit and banana blossom, which are cultural staples for some communities. I also miss when some chefs would create a special plant-based dish just for me if I called in advance – hold the vegan burger please, I miss the VIP treatment!

1/24/2022,"A cryptocurrency-backed consortium that paid £2.2m – 100 times the estimate – for concept art for an unmade film adaptation of Dune has claimed that their animated version has gone into development despite questions over copyright. The group, called Spice DAO, caused a flurry of excitement on social media when it announced last weekend that it had bought the book of art, created by director Alejandro Jodorowsky in the 1970s, at auction in November and planned to “make the book public (to the extent permitted by law)” and, more ambitiously, to “produce an original animated limited series inspired by the book and sell it to a streaming service”.  Frank Herbert’s novel Dune has been filmed three times: David Lynch’s 1984 version, a TV miniseries in 2000, and Denis Villeneuve’s version released last autumn. However, as many people pointed out in the thousands of replies to Saturday’s Twitter post, ownership of a copy of a book, no matter how much was paid for it, does not confer any intellectual property rights to either distribute copies of it or to adapt it into another medium. The announcement was roundly dismissed as a stunt by social media users who suspect Spice DAO’s ultimate plan is to sell the individual pages from the book as NFTs – digital images with ownership rights – especially as there was speculation on a Spice DAO internet forum that the physical book could be burned as a publicity stunt after the NFTs have sold. While the book did indeed sell at Christie’s in Paris for €2.6m on 21 November, Spice DAO have offered no actual proof that they are the purchasers, nor explained why the price paid was so astronomical when the auction house had put a €25,000-35-000 estimate on it. It has been reported that Spice DAO’s co-founder, millionaire Soban Saqib, put up the bulk of the purchase fee from his own funds after raising $750,000 (£550,000) from the consortium’s members. Adrien Legendre, of the books department of Christie’s in Paris, told the Guardian that the book came from the private collection of an individual and that bids were taken on the day from the room, by phone and online – where the winning bid came from, which Legendre was not at liberty to discuss. As to the surprising price the book realised, Legendre said that the estimate was based on “previous sale results, reflecting the appetite and market for the object and the context”. In a Medium post on Thursday, Spice DAO seemed to concede that they did not have any rights to adapt Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel – and instead were ploughing ahead with creating an original animated series. The post reads: “After two months of outreach, conversations with former business partners and consultations with legal counsel we have not been able to reach an agreement with any of the rights holders involved in the creation of the contents of the book of collected storyboards of Jodorowsky’s Dune. “Our research over the past two months has only increased our respect for their project and we were so inspired by the book and learning more about its creation that we saw how we could develop our own intellectual property that we own 100% and control all aspects of the production of an original animated limited series. Spice DAO claims are in the development phase and have a “whirlwind week of meetings” coming up with writers, producers, three Los Angeles animation studios, graphic novel publishers, and the “entertainment attorney for Drake” – presumably the Canadian-born rapper. Kirsty Stewart, legal director and trademark attorney in the Dundee office of law firm Thorntons, wrote on the company’s site: “Unfortunately for Spice DOA, the collective who purchased the Jodorowsky Dune bible, Frank Herbert died in 1986, meaning copyright persists in the base text of Dune until at least 2056. Similarly, the book they purchased, as it was produced to sell the idea to studios at the time, is likely protected by copyright until at least 2092, as Jodorowsky, one of the authors of the book, remains alive. “As such, in order to produce or authorise derivative works such as an animated series, Spice DOA would need to obtain licenses from the Herbert estate, as well as potentially Jodorowsky (and any other authors such as Michel Seydoux) if the adaptation was based on the Jodorowsky book. Similar to how buying a Batman comic does not give you the inherent rights to produce a new Batman film, the purchasing of this director’s bible does not give Spice DOA any intrinsic rights to produce new material.” French-Chilean director Jodorowsky acquired the film rights to Dune in 1974, and envisaged an epic topping 15 hours. Jodorowsky engaged a trio of comic book and science fiction artists – Jean Giraud, known as Moebius; Chris Foss, a British illustrator famous for his science fiction novel covers; and Swiss artist HR Giger, who would later become known for his concept work on the Alien movies – to design the look and feel of his projected adaptation. They failed to get financial backing from the studios, though, and the project died, its only legacy being the concept art books that Jodorowsky produced – of which Christie’s say only around 10 survive. The lot sold in November was described by Christie’s as “oblong octavo (210 x 295 mm). 11 colour plates, after drawings by Christopher Foss, Jean Giraud-Moebius and HR Giger, one title-page, 268 black and white plates, mostly the storyboard for the movie, with dialogues in French and English, and some studies for characters, environments and vehicles, one page with the printer’s name and address. All the plates are photographic reproductions, printed single-side.” It has been pointed out on social media that many of the pages of the rare book are already available online. Spice DAO were contacted via their Twitter account and after initially seeming amenable to conversation, blocked this writer after being asked: “How do you propose to adapt a book that you don’t have the rights for and get a streaming service to take it? Or is this more about selling the pages as NFTs?”",Arts/Film,"Jodorowsky animated Dune in development, says crypto group",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/24/dune-animation-based-on-jodorowsky-concept-art-in-development-says-cryptocurrency-group-spice-dao-frank-herbert
1/24/2022,"The France scrum-half Antoine Dupont has been voted the Rugby Union Writers’ Club’s Personality of the Year for 2021. Dupont succeeds the Exeter director of rugby Rob Baxter as holder of the Pat Marshall Memorial Award following an outstanding 12 months for Les Bleus and Toulouse, the club he helped to a Champions Cup and Top 14 double.  The current World Rugby player of the year has continued to redefine scrum-half play through the excellence of his running and kicking games, generalship and defence. In May, Dupont was also named European player of the year. The 25-year-old has emerged as a leader for France, captaining them last autumn in a successful series that included a first home victory over New Zealand since 2009. His pedigree means France head into the forthcoming Six Nations as the favourites, though he is expected to miss their opening match against Italy having recently tested positive for Covid-19. He follows in the footsteps of greats of the game to have been acclaimed by the RUWC such as Gareth Edwards, Jonah Lomu, Martin Johnson, Jonny Wilkinson, Brian O’Driscoll, Maggie Alphonsi and Dan Carter. Dupont came out on top of a poll of the RUWC’s 250-plus members encompassing writers, photographers and broadcasters. Other top contenders who polled highly included the Wales and British & Lions captain Alun Wyn Jones, the Pacific Islands rugby campaigner Dan Leo, rising the England and Harlequins star Marcus Smith as well as the Red Roses second row Zoe Aldcroft and the head coach Simon Middleton.",Sport/Sport,France scrum-half Antoine Dupont is rugby writers’ Personality of the Year,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/24/france-scrum-half-antoine-dupont-is-rugby-union-writers-personality-of-the-year
1/24/2022,"The once familiar sight of bustling Bridgewater Hall greeted the Hallé orchestra, who opened their spring season with a long-awaited performance of Mahler’s Third Symphony – originally scheduled for May 2020. Where Mahler’s Second Symphony follows the passage of darkness into light, the Third gets even closer to his world-encompassing aspiration, charting nature’s journey via mankind towards God’s love. Involving six, lopsidedly arranged movements, requiring a vast number of musicians and lasting for well over 90 minutes, it’s an ambitious piece to programme at any time, but, with a vista of performers on one side and a packed auditorium on the other, Mark Elder was a picture of calm, interrupting his economical gestures only to shake more sound out of the strings.Elder’s dedication to painting the big picture can come at the expense of rhythmic transparency, but the sound he conjures from the Hallé is plush, dramatic and – crucially for this work – unhurried. The orchestra’s nine horns began proceedings resolutely as each section presented their own vivid colours in turn through the sprawling opening movement, Katy Jones’s sonorous trombone solo the pick of the bunch.  Symphonic logic rapidly departs as the piece travels through an impish minuet to a folksy movement originally titled What the Animals of the Forest Tell Me – the latter possessed bags of the earthiness that’s key to releasing Mahler’s magic. The two vocal movements brought sharply contrasting characters: Alice Coote leant heavily into the world-weary mood of Nietzsche’s enigmatic “superman” text, while the Hallé Choirs delivered their short contributions with gusto. The slender fifth movement was a multi-layered delight, courtesy of beaming “bimm! bamm!”s from the Children’s Choir and genuine church bells (borrowed from the Liverpool Philharmonic). But the evening’s high point was Elder’s judicious handling of the finale’s consecutive peaks – measured in its passion, and rapturously applauded.",Arts/Music,Hallé/Elder review – Elder’s measured passion unleashes Mahler’s magic,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/24/halle-elder-review-mahler-3-bridgewater-hall-manchester
1/24/2022,"Adults in England and Wales are being encouraged to apply online via “a revised, streamlined recruitment process” to become a lay magistrate, in an effort to tackle a backlog of criminal cases caused by the pandemic. A week after announcing plans to double the maximum sentence that magistrates can pass to a year, Dominic Raab, the justice secretary, said the judiciary would recruit another 4,000.  It will be the largest recruitment effort in the 650-year history of the magistracy, the Ministry of Justice said. Courts in England and Wales have been struggling to clear a backlog of cases. As of November, 372,000 cases were outstanding in the magistrates courts and a further 58,728 in the crown court system. The number of magistrates has plummeted in the past decade, from 25,170 in 2012 to 12,651, according to the most recent figures last year. The MoJ said it was investing £1m in the recruitment campaign, which would attempt to reach potential recruits “from teachers to bricklayers, to stay-at-home mums” and would seek to “make the magistracy more representative of the communities it serves”. The campaign would specifically target younger people, it said. Unpaid volunteer magistrates sit for at least 13 days a year, hearing family and criminal cases from their local community. As of last April, just over eight in 10 were over 50, and 56% were women. According to a 2018 estimate, 13% are from a black, Asian or minority ethnic background, compared with 13.8% of the UK population. The largest proportion of minority ethnic magistrates were from an Asian background, at 7%; 4% were black and 1% were mixed. Statistics on the intersection of gender and ethnicity groups in the magistracy were not available. “Magistrates are the unsung heroes of the justice system and we want people from every part of society represented in their ranks,” Raab said. “Alongside our plans to double their sentencing powers from six months to a year, this recruitment drive will ensure magistrates can play an even greater role in restoring the swift justice the public deserve.” Bev Higgs, the national chair of the Magistrates’ Association, said: “The Magistrates’ Association is pleased to support this recruitment campaign and would encourage people of all ages and backgrounds to contribute their lived experience, knowledge and commitment to the judiciary. “It is vitally important that magistrates courts reflect their local communities, and we welcome all who join us in this unique and very rewarding role.” But not all lawyers welcomed the plans. One leading criminal lawyer, Raj Chada, of Hodge Jones Allen, said: “In a post-pandemic world where job insecurity is even more pronounced, few can take time from their job to become lay magistrates. Those that do tend to be better off, older or retired and white. This creates the perception of an officer class, pronouncing judgment on those of a different class. It is hardly going to increase confidence in the criminal justice system.”",News/Law,"Campaign seeks to recruit 4,000 lay magistrates in England and Wales",https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jan/24/campaign-seeks-to-recruit-4000-lay-magistrates-in-england-and-wales
1/24/2022,"Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker and candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, stoked outrage on Sunday by predicting members of the House committee investigating the Capitol attack will be imprisoned if Republicans retake the chamber this year.  One of two Republicans on the committee, Liz Cheney, said: “A former speaker of the House is threatening jail time for members of Congress who are investigating the violent attack on our Capitol and our constitution. This is what it looks like when the rule of law unravels.” Gingrich made his name with scorched-earth opposition to Bill Clinton in the 1990s and ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012. He is now a prominent Trump supporter, rightwing gadfly and adviser to House Republican leaders. He made his prediction on Fox News, for which he is a contributor. Calling the members of the 6 January committee “wolves [who] are going to find out that they’re now sheep”, he said that if Republicans take Congress in November, “this is all going to come crashing down … they’re the ones who in fact, I think, face a real risk of jail for the kinds of laws they’re breaking”. The 6 January committee has recommended criminal charges for the former White House adviser Steve Bannon and Mark Meadows, Trump’s final chief of staff. Both refused to comply with subpoenas. Bannon has pleaded not guilty to contempt of Congress, a charge that carries a year in jail, with a trial set for the summer. The Department of Justice has not acted regarding Meadows. Gingrich said: “You have, both with Attorney General [Merrick] Garland and this select committee on 6 January, people who have run amok … they’re running over people’s civil liberties. “And what they need to understand is on 4 January next year, you’re going to have a Republican majority in the House and a Republican majority in the Senate. And all these people who have been so tough, and so mean, and so nasty are going to be delivered subpoenas for every document, every conversation, every tweet, every email.” Gingrich also said the committee was “basically a lynch mob”. Another member of the committee, the Democrat Zoe Lofgren, told CNN Gingrich’s comments were “just bizarre. I think Newt has really lost it. You know, it leaves me speechless.” Alluding to Trump’s attempt to overturn his defeat in part through the Capitol putsch, Lofgren added: “I mean, unless he is assuming that the government does get overthrown and there’s no system of justice.” Most observers expect Republicans to at least retake the House in November and to turn their sights on Democrats, who impeached Trump twice, and Joe Biden. But some see a legal net closing on Trump himself. Last week it emerged that the 6 January committee has requested interviews with figures including Ivanka Trump, a move that prompted the former president to complain about “vicious people” who “go after children”. Ivanka Trump is 40. Furthermore, Donald Trump’s niece was among observers to point out that Trump himself has no problem going after other people’s children. Speaking to MSNBC, Mary Trump accused her uncle of “enormous hypocrisy”, for going after Hunter Biden, the president’s son, “who last I checked never worked for the federal government, so his double standard is grotesque on its face”. Mary Trump also had a warning for her cousin, saying Trump “will throw anybody under the bus if he believes it’s in his best interest to do so”. Also on Sunday, the chair of the House committee, the Mississippi Democrat Bennie Thompson, told CBS the panel has spoken to William Barr, Trump’s second attorney general. Barr stoked criticism by overseeing investigation of Trump’s claims of electoral fraud in his defeat by Biden but infuriated the president when he said no evidence was found. He resigned before 6 January. Cheney and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois defied Republican leadership to join the select committee. Kinzinger will retire at the midterms. Cheney faces a Trump-endorsed challenger. Other senior Republicans, including Trump allies Jim Jordan and Scott Perry and the minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, have refused requests to co-operate with the House committee.",News/US news,Outrage as Newt Gingrich says Capitol attack investigators could be jailed,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/24/newt-gingrich-capitol-attack-committee-jail
1/24/2022,"The government has finally caught up with what most animal behavioural scientists have been saying for years by formally recognising animals as sentient beings in its animal welfare (sentience) bill. In November it was confirmed that the scope of the bill would be extended to include in the “sentient” category all decapod crustaceans (such as crabs and lobsters) and cephalopods (including octopuses, squid and cuttlefish). This ruling heeds a review led by Jonathan Birch of the London School of Economics, who points out: “Octopuses and other cephalopods have been protected in science for years, but have not received any protection outside science until now.”  Although these rulings are welcome, their tardiness is sobering. People have been arguing fiercely, dogmatically and even violently about animal welfare for a very long time – yet framing the issue in terms of legally enforced rights comes with baggage about the socially constructed (and therefore exclusively human) nature of moral status and rights-based reasoning. The starting point should rather have been the nature of animal cognition: how we and other beings are situated in a broad panorama of minds. While there is still plenty to learn about that mindscape, Birch is right to imply that, given what science has already told us, it borders on the absurd that UK law took so long to formally acknowledge animal sentience. There was, however, a long historical tradition of human prejudice and exceptionalism to overcome. Aristotle distinguished humans from other animals by asserting that only we have a “rational soul”, in addition to the “sensitive soul” of animals. In the 17th century René Descartes notoriously asserted that animals are mindless mechanisms, so that we shouldn’t mistake signs of apparent pain or distress as an indication that brute beasts truly feel anything at all. His supporters were accused of the most heartless acts of vivisection (although Descartes himself was said to be devoted to his dog, Monsieur Grat). Charles Darwin’s claim that there are “no fundamental differences between man and the higher mammals in terms of mental faculties” didn’t deter the radical behaviourist psychologists of the 1950-70s, such as BF Skinner, from returning to something like the Cartesian view of animals as automata. (Skinner saw no ethical problem in training pigeons to be living guidance systems inside bombs.) Not until the modern age of neuroscience have we truly begun to recognise a continuity of neural hardware and cognitive ability between us and other animals. Still the question lingers of whether there is some fundamental difference of mind that makes humans special. Certainly, the sophistication of our language, and perhaps in consequence of our culture, seems unique. But there’s no reason to suppose that the capacity to experience pain, curiosity, empathy and other felt aspects of existence belongs to humans alone. Some biologists now argue that sentience may be a property of all living things, even bacteria and single cells. They assert that plants, despite lacking a nervous system, show signs of genuine cognition, even feeling. But if it is still disputed at what point in the living world sentience begins, the view expressed by philosopher Daniel Dennett is now common: “Sentience comes in every imaginable grade and intensity, from the simplest and most ‘robotic’, to the most exquisitely sensitive, ‘hyper-reactive’ human.” The concept of sentience liberates the debate from the more contentious matter of whether other animals are conscious: a question in which the obsolete Enlightenment view that “human reason” is like a divine spark activated within us is still discernible. A ghost of Aristotelian exceptionalism remains in the suspicion that, while other animals may be sentient, only humans have that special form of it we call consciousness. The problem is that it’s hard to assign clear, quantifiable meanings to these words – even in humans, where, for example, arguments rage over the cognitive status of people in a permanent vegetative state after brain trauma (that very term harking back to Aristotle’s view of plants as possessing a mere “vegetative soul”). Although we might not know or agree on what consciousness is, it looks increasingly peculiar to imagine it as a single and absolute cognitive attribute. The question for animal welfare is how the evident differences in “qualities of mind” between species colour our attitudes and obligations. One commonly cited criterion is whether other animals experience pain. American neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux argues that emotions such as pain are human-specific responses to physiological reactions: narratives we alone can create because of our linguistic capacity (for example, “I’m hurting”). Others counter that, since all observable indicators of and responses to “pain” in, say, dogs or chimps, look like those in us, it makes no sense to imagine some fundamental difference. At any rate, the humane position is surely to assume an equivalence unless we have clear reason not to. And it’s not just about physical pain. Experiments have shown, for example, that farmed pigs respond as if “depressed” when kept in barren conditions devoid of mental stimulation, responding to signals (about food, say) as if they have acquired a pessimistic lack of interest in things that might benefit them. Again, we don’t know what that situation feels like to a pig – but they do seem to have a response to their experience that displays a sensitivity to the richness (or not) of their surroundings. One challenge is how to avoid framing this debate in anthropomorphic terms, to assess rights on the basis of how closely an animal seems to approach human-like cognition. Cephalopods in particular have suffered from that tendency. The common ancestor we share with them probably lived about 600m years ago – far more distant than that of all vertebrates, such as fish – and their nervous systems are very different: most of an octopus’s neurons are in the arms, not the central brain. Some researchers think they might have a kind of dual or even multiple consciousness – a bizarre situation we struggle to imagine. Octopuses are “probably the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien”, says philosopher Peter Godfrey-Smith. For octopuses do show signs of considerable intelligence, even if their motives can be hard to deduce. For this reason, in 2019 more than 100 experts in cephalopod cognition called for a ban on octopus farming in “sterile, monotonous” environments. In the end, the notion of “rights” is hugely anthropocentric. Even the rights of, say, human embryos or people in untreatable comas (which might be argued to have less sentience than a chimp) are framed in terms of the potential for human experience. The Great Ape Project makes a compelling case for rights among our closest primate relatives: to not be killed (except in self-defence), to be allowed freedom and dignity, habitat protection and freedom from intentionally inflicted physical and psychological pain. But while the often blunt instruments of law can be needed to prevent obvious abuses, the better question is not what animals “deserve” or should be granted, but what kinds of mind they have, and what obligations we humans incur towards them as a result.

1/24/2022,"The TV gardener Alan Titchmarsh has said he refuses to eat avocados for breakfast because of their “enormous carbon footprint” and much prefers Shreddies. Writing in Gardeners’ World magazine, Titchmarsh said he could not bear the idea of “forcing” down the “insipid” fruit first thing in the morning, before suggesting that he believed it should be boycotted on environmental grounds.  “It seems there is a great movement towards smashed avocado on sourdough bread. I can’t think of anything more insipid to force down my neck at the crack of dawn,” he wrote. “And then there are the environmental considerations,” he went on. “I cannot reconcile myself to eating avocados and contributing to the enormous carbon footprint involved in shipping them across the ocean to my breakfast table, not to mention the wholesale destruction of the rainforest to create such plantations. No, avocado is a non-starter for me.” It isn’t the first time Titchmarsh has spoken on the environment. In 2019 he told the same magazine that it would be “hypocritical” for green campaigners to criticise governments and celebrities for not doing enough to fight climate change while continuing to do things such as block-paving their gardens, buying imported out-of-season fruits, and eating avocados. According to the Sustainable Food Trust, growing a single avocado requires up to 320 litres of water, with demand in the global north fuelling the export of the green fruits over long distances and their growth on expansive farms in central and South America. Rather than eating avocados for breakfast, the 72-year-old broadcaster said that, despite it not being very filling, he was a “devoted Shreddies fan”. Though he believes Weetabix is better at fuelling a busy day in the garden, he said he could only manage three, and was blown away when his youngest daughter, Camilla, ate six. “I am a devoted Shreddies fan, but their boast of keeping hunger locked up until lunchtime is optimistic if you plan to be energetic in the spade and fork department,” he wrote. “Weetabix then? Yes. But how many? When my youngest daughter was at primary school her personal best at breakfast time was six. Six! And she was a tiny little thing. Still is surprising. My own personal best is three, and that does seem to do the trick until coffee time.” Titchmarsh added that he longs to come downstairs one morning and discover a boiled kipper or some finely crafted kedgeree for his delectation and delight. “Kedgeree! Now there’s a proper breakfast.”",Arts/Television & radio,Alan Titchmarsh says he avoids avocados because of climate impact,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/24/alan-titchmarsh-avocados-climate-impact
