3/5/2022,"A Russian entrepreneur who offered a $1 million bounty for the arrest of Russian President Vladimir Putin says he posted the reward because he wants to solidify Putin’s public image as a war criminal. “I did it because I want to contribute to the change of perception of Putin from an unquestionable ruler to somebody who is perceived by Russians as a criminal, and an illegitimate president who is essentially a usurper of power,” Alex Konanykhim, CEO of software company TransparentBusiness, told Fortune. Now, because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Konanykhim says Putin’s allies will turn their backs on him. “Oligarchs used to be strong supporters of Putin for one very simple reason: he was good for business,” Konanykhim said. “Now Putin is bad for business. Oligarchs, particularly, are trying to hide their assets. Their yachts are getting seized. They're trying to distance themselves from Putin to such a degree that everyone knows they’re no longer friends.” On Wednesday, Roman Abramovich, a Russian billionaire who is known to be close to Putin, announced that he would sell his Chelsea soccer team and pledged to give the proceeds to victims of the Ukrainian war. It was a clear sign of the turning tides, according to Konanykhim. “In less than a week, the [Russian] oligarchs are no longer friends with Putin, and Putin realizes it quite well because he's not stupid,” Konanykhim told Fortune. Putin will be left alone as his fair weather friends abandon him, according to Konanykhim, who said it took a mere week of war for oligarchs to begin distancing themselves from the Russian president. “Putin’s power is based on encouraging fear from other people. And if he starts looking like a loser, instead of an invincible and powerful leader, he will lose power very fast,” Konanykhim told Fortune. It’s not just the Russian elite who are separating themselves from Putin, he is also facing criticism from the children of oligarchs and officials, who are protesting the Russian invasion of Ukraine on social media. Konanykhim said he truly hopes that Putin will be captured and that he would be happy to pay $1 million to an officer who would execute his constitutional duty and arrest Putin. “It would give me a lot of pleasure for the chance to pay a reward to an officer for seizing Putin,” Konanykhim said. “I would be just delighted but I'm not naive. I realize that it's not as easy as creating a posting and two days later, somebody knocks on the door holding Putin with a bag on his head. I understand that.” Konanykhim started his career by “building a bank from scratch” in Russia during communist rule and after moving to the U.S., he became an entrepreneur and the CEO of TransparentBusiness, as well as the executive producer of The Unicorn Hunters television show, which revolves around investment and business. He is comfortable expressing his dissent on social media because he currently lives in California, rather than in Russia, where Putin has eliminated free media by criminalizing dissent. Putin has an army of “trolls who police social media,” and look to punish users who create critical posts about the Russian government, according to Konanykhim. “In Russia, people get jail sentences, not just for posting something political against the government, but even for ‘liking’ something on social media,” Konanykhim said. “People go to jail for just hitting the ‘like’ button. So yeah, California is much more friendly for self expression.” Konanykhim claims that one of his relatives in Russia shared his Facebook post that disparaged Putin as a war criminal, and now risks arrest and prosecution. “I told my family member to leave the country immediately because he could get such a long prison sentence for just a post,” Konanykhim said.

3/5/2022,"Russian forces fired at a Sky News team on the outskirts of Kyiv on Friday. The crew was taping their report when they came under fire, and captured the harrowing footage. Correspondent Stuart Ramsay and cameraman Richie Mocker were both struck, according to Sky News. A Sky News crew of reporters and video producers said they were shot at by Russian forces on the outskirts of Kyiv, recording the attack as two of the staff members were struck by the bullets. The crew had been travelling between Bucha, where a Russian convoy was destroyed by Ukrainian forces, and the capital. According to Sky News, the crew passed through several Ukrainian-controlled checkpoints before reaching an empty road where they were fired on. —Andy Hughes (@SkyAndyHughes) March 4, 2022 In the video, the journalists can be heard pulling over after the first bullet strikes the windshield, then shielding themselves behind their car doors and shouting out that they are members of the press. ""We didn't know it at the time, but we were later told by the Ukrainians that we were being ambushed by a saboteur Russian reconnaissance squad,"" Sky News wrote in its report. ""It was professional, the rounds kept smashing into the car — they didn't miss."" The shooting lasted for several minutes, with correspondent Stuart Ramsay and cameraman Richie Mocker both struck, according to Sky News.

3/5/2022,"Russian affairs expert Fiona Hill said there is one group of people in particular that Russian President Vladimir Putin “probably has to worry about” more than anyone else if his invasion of Ukraine doesn’t go as planned. It’s not Russia’s obscenely rich oligarchs, who face economic sanctions and seizures of their assets worldwide, the former top analyst on the National Security Council told Stephen Colbert on Wednesday’s broadcast of “The Late Show.” Instead, it’s the “very small circle” — such as Russia’s heads of intelligence, military and security services — who cooked up the invasion plan with Putin, said Hill. “These are not the kind of guys who have yachts off Monaco, palaces in Paris or anything like this,” Hill explained. “These are people who are very much rooted in Russia itself and I don’t think they’re too worried about all of these sanctions and everything that’s cut off, because they’re not invested in the West. They’ve really got that bunker siege mentality — fortress Russia.” Members of this small circle are who Putin “probably does have to worry about” if “it looks like Russia is losing,” said Hill, an intelligence analyst under former President George W. Bush and Barack Obama who later served on the National Security Council under Donald Trump. Hill was an important witness during Trump’s first impeachment. “I don’t think they care about the world of public opinion,” Hill added. “But if there’s not any movement on the ground, if that great convoy of tanks just basically runs out of gas and is just left there, and if they have to kind of lay waste to Ukraine to basically get a success … you might then start to get a backlash from those people who are thinking this has not gone as they intended.” Watch the interview here: This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

3/5/2022,"Rick Hoebeke said he got a strange call in 2014 when a person asked him to come and take look at a bizarre spider. The Georgia Museum of Natural History collection manager had no idea the species would soon make a name for itself in his home state and beyond. The Joro spider is the newest invasive species of spider in the eastern part of the U.S., with experts anticipating they will continue to spread throughout the region, National Geographic reported. The spider —an intimidating medley of neon yellow, red and teal highlights — is as big as your palm, according to a news release from the University of Georgia. That’s enough to make any arachnophobe’s skin crawl, but the spindly creature might offer some environmental benefits, too. Hoebeke’s encounter with the Joro spider in 2014 inspired a project to identify the strange species and track where it came from in the first place, UGA reported. It was discovered the spider is from East Asia, Hoebeke said, and may have been brought to the states in a shipping container that was dropped off along Interstate 85 in Georgia. Ever since it was dropped off, Hoebeke says the population has started to boom, spurring hundreds of emails from people on how to exterminate them. One of the most intimidating features of the Joro spider is its webs. One UGA entomologist has had a perfect research opportunity for the spiders in his very backyard in Winterville. Will Hudson has to brave massive Joro spider webs out front of his home, which are plastered across his porch ten feet deep. “Last year, there were dozens of spiders, and they began to be something of a nuisance when I was doing yard work,” Hudson told UGA. “This year, I have several hundred, and they actually make the place look spooky with all the messy webs — like a scene out of ‘Arachnophobia.’” Hudson enjoys the beauty of the spiders, but has to push back on the swelling population at his home by stepping on them, raking up their webs and spraying aerosol product on them. “I know. They are gorgeous spiders,” he told UGA with a chuckle. “But there are just too damn many of them.” The Joro spider’s fangs are so small they might not even manage to break human skin, according to National Geographic, meaning they aren’t considered much of a threat to humans. Scientists haven’t seen any impacts to native wildlife as a result of the spider. But amid the thick webs and unrelenting tide of Joro spiders in Georgia, there may be a silver lining, UGA entomologist Nancy Hinkle said. Hinkle said that the new local could offer good pest control against different bugs that interfere with people’s lives and the environment. “Joro spiders present us with excellent opportunities to suppress pests naturally, without chemicals, so I’m trying to convince people that having zillions of large spiders and their webs around is a good thing!” she told UGA. One of the bugs that UGA hopes the Joro spiders can help limit is stink bugs, which are detrimental to crops. The spiders should be fairly easy to avoid, Hinkle said, as long as hundreds don’t set up camp on your front porch. If the creatures are giving residents a headache, the swaths of webs and spiders inside them will fall away in November as the population dies. Before the female spiders die in the fall, they will leave behind a sac of eggs, Hinkle said. The eggs will drift in the air with silk parachutes, spreading across the eastern part of the U.S. Sightings of the Joro spider have been reported in Georgia around Atlanta and Athens, along with parts of Tennessee and the Western Carolinas, according to Al.com. Hudson told UGA that citizens would be best off learning how to coexist with the creatures and finding ways to manage their population. He suggests identifying females to eradicate in order to limit egg production.
