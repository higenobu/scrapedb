2/8/2022,"Ivan Rakitic had the ball in his hands and their fate in them too, or at least that‚Äôs how it felt. On moments like this titles turn, so it goes. Sevilla had spent the last two months hanging in there, the team still standing even as players were falling, clinging on for a chance like this. But time was running out on the first day of the rest of their season, the opportunity they had waited for untaken and slipping away again. Until suddenly, almost out of nothing, it was given back. All they now had to do was score a last-minute penalty and they really would be in the race for La Liga. Yeah, all. And no, they didn‚Äôt.  On Saturday night Rakitic‚Äôs injury-time spot kick was saved by the Osasuna goalkeeper Sergio Herrera to see out a 0-0 draw and 24 hours later Real Madrid defeated Granada 1-0, the finest of margins bringing the greatest of changes and, all over Spain, the most definitive of judgments: from a point behind and Game On to six points off and Game Over. Sevilla left Pamplona with a feeling of what might have been. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sad,‚Äù coach Julen Lopetegui said. This, after all, had been the moment that might decide how far his side could go. Yet there are still 15 weeks left and that they had come this far said something, reason enough to believe it could still be. Defeated just twice all season, Sevilla are unbeaten in nine since a 2-1 loss at the Bernab√©u in November: a game they led, dominated for 70 minutes and lost in the 88th, one that had felt oddly inevitable somehow, a missed opportunity that was sort of predictable, another almost but not quite. But they had followed it by beating Villarreal, Athletic and Atl√©tico in a row, a last-minute Lucas Ocampos goal finally seeing off Diego Simeone‚Äôs team, before drawing 1-1 with Barcelona, and beating C√°diz and Getafe. On the face of it, it hadn‚Äôt always been that impressive, a hint of yeah but about them; contradictory though it sounds, there was a sense of Sevilla playing within themselves and yet also permanently on edge. Four of those five wins were 1-0, the other 2-1. And just as that put them back within touching distance, it evaded them again with two consecutive draws. There‚Äôs nothing really wrong with finishing 1-1 with Valencia and 2-2 with Celta, but both were matches they might have won ‚Äì against Valencia they scored early and wasted chances to make it safe, against Celta they came back from 2-0 down and then hit the post ‚Äì and both felt like opportunities lost, like they suffer vertigo when the top is in sight, like something‚Äôs missing. A lot has been missing. And the good news, the thing that really was impressive, was that the league hadn‚Äôt already gone, that Sevilla were still close enough for a challenge to remain possible. Jes√∫s Navas has been able to start just eight league games all season; Suso and En Nesyri, six; √ârik Lamela, five. They had spent two months with absences in double figures every week, those that were able to play pretty much having to play every game. And as soon as En Nesyri was fit again, he was off to the Africa Cup of Nations. Goalkeeper Yassine Bono was joining him, as was Munir. This weekend they were back and others came with them, giving this the feel of a fresh beginning in which they were ready to step up. In the winter window Sevilla signed Anthony Martial and Tecatito Corona, but just as important as what they had done was what they had not done: like with Jule Kound√© in the summer, they had not sold Diego Carlos, the club that always lets go holding on. That seemed like a statement, like they knew this season was an opportunity that might not be back again; although they wouldn‚Äôt say so publicly, this was a league they could compete for. ‚ÄúFans keep telling us ‚Äòyou have to catch Madrid‚Äô,‚Äù Rakitic admitted last week and it coincided with the first real hint that Madrid‚Äôs lead needn‚Äôt be unassailable: held by C√°diz, beaten by Getafe, needing a late comeback to draw with Elche, Madrid had won two from five in La Liga and had just been knocked out of the Cup by Athletic, vulnerability revealed. Karim Benzema was injured, others were tired, and PSG awaited round the corner. Beat Osasuna and Sevilla would be just one point behind, piling the pressure on a team in which cracks were at last appearing. Trouble was, it was happening again. Fernando, quietly going about being the best deep midfielder in Spain, was out. Ocampos got injured in the warm-up. Gonzalo Montiel, returning from international duty with Argentina, was forced off after six minutes. Kound√© wasn‚Äôt fit enough to start, not introduced until the 58th minute. The same went for Papu G√≥mez. And they only went on because there was no choice. If Osasuna were the better side and Sevilla had seemed happy enough to let the first half go by, trusting that chances would present themselves and time was on their side ‚Äì a recurring theme this season ‚Äì it was slipping away from them. There had been very little from Martial on the left ‚Äì ‚Äúhe has not played much and bit by bit has to integrate,‚Äù Lopetegui said afterwards ‚Äì and Sevilla had to force this. But while they had the ball, although their ability to bring it out impressed, much as they quickened the tempo and sharpened their intent, and despite Osasuna‚Äôs manager admitting his team felt their strength sap away, they created little. Getafe 3-0 Levante, Osasuna 0-0 Sevilla, Celta Vigo 2-0 Rayo Vallecano, Real Mallorca 2-1 C√°diz, Elche 3-1 Alav√©s, Real Madrid 1-0 Granada, Real Betis 0-2 Villarreal, Barcelona 4-2 Atl√©tico Madrid, Valencia 0-0 Real Sociedad Another chance seemed to be escaping them, which is when it really did. There were 29 seconds left when another cross was swung in from the left and Kound√© went down, challenged by Manu S√°nchez. At first Valent√≠n Pizarro G√≥mez ignored it but a voice came from the VAR room and so he stopped, listened and eventually set off to take a look, studiously ignoring the crowd of players shepherding him to the sideline with helpful suggestions. There, he saw a swipe of S√°nchez‚Äôs foot and contact with Kound√©‚Äôs boot. It wasn‚Äôt much, but with 91.30 on the clock, it was enough for him to draw a telly with his fingers and point to the spot, where Rakitic was waiting. The league was alive, Sevilla had been saved. They were in their captain‚Äôs hands now, which was about the best place they could be. The nearest thing to a sevillano in the team, the man who fell in love on his first night in the city, meeting his wife to be in a hotel 50 metres from the S√°nchez Pizju√°n, the player who went away and insisted on coming back again, his return met with rejoicing. The first foreign captain there since Diego Maradona, he is the player who proudly tells the story of his wife‚Äôs grandfather refusing to take off his Sevilla watch, dying with it on. He tells the story too of his mother-in-law sending him a text after he had missed a penalty against Rayo a decade ago, saying: ‚ÄúThe dog takes them better than you do.‚Äù But he‚Äôs also the man who had not missed one in eight years. Since then, Rakitic had taken nine and scored them all. During normal time that is: he had also become the first player to twice score the winning penalty in World Cup shoot-outs: his spot-kicks took Croatia to the quarters and the semis in Russia, displaying nerves of steel. As for the last time he had taken one in La Liga, he had coolly rolled in a late penalty at Real Madrid on a wild weekend, keeping alive their hopes of winning the title with three games to go. He had been here before, in other words, no one better to rely on to score now to take them even closer.

No, it hadn‚Äôt all come to this, and there are still four months left, but it felt that way; like belief depended on this ball hitting the net, which is why it felt so bad when it didn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúThis is the penalty that could decide the title!‚Äù shouted the commentator one radio station. On the bench, Lopetegui sat alone, rubbing his face, blinking rapidly. Marcos Acu√±a couldn‚Äôt look, standing near the centre circle facing the other way. Rakitic gazed at the ball. One shot to have a shot. He hit it left, but Herrera dived to saved, leaping up to block the rebound from G√≥mez too, roaring with El Sadar as another opportunity escaped Sevilla, the title candidates who just won‚Äôt let go but just can‚Äôt quite hold on either.",Sport/Football,From game on to game over?

2/8/2022,"Stay came to life one morning in my converted garage in the back of my house in LA: a very unassuming studio, all knotty pine and carpet, my recording equipment in a cupboard. Siobhan Fahey lived down the road and her then-husband Dave Stewart [ex-Eurythmics] had given her a lift over, then he came in, because he had an idea.  The idea came from these amazing parties Dave and Siobhan used to have. You would not believe the crew that would show up ‚Äì Tom Petty, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne from ELO, Timothy Leary. Eventually, we would all start singing and jamming, and I would always end up doing ballads. Dave said: ‚ÄúYou know how you always sing those ballads at our parties? Wouldn‚Äôt it be great to style a song like that to feature you?‚Äù And he had an idea for chords and a melody. Stay was rewritten maybe four times ‚Äì it sounded like a Prince song at one point ‚Äì before Siobhan and I went back to the original, developed it, and made a cassette of it. We played it to Chris Thomas, the producer of Roxy Music and the Sex Pistols, who was staying at Dave and Siobhan‚Äôs. We weren‚Äôt expecting anything, but I remember the room was completely silent: everyone was listening really intently. After it stopped, Chris stood up, and he went: ‚ÄúNo 1 smash!‚Äù And we were like: ‚ÄúYeah? Really?‚Äù Later, when the final mix wasn‚Äôt working, we asked Chris to help. He rescued that song and made it sound incredible. Jennifer Maidman, from Penguin Cafe Orchestra, came up with the great synthesiser parts for the chorus, and Steve Ferrera, the drummer, also did great things. It entered the charts at No 27. Then we played Top of the Pops and it kept steadily going up. When it got to No 1 and stayed there for eight weeks, it was really unexpected. But it was incredible that that could happen. I think it‚Äôs still one of the longest-running No 1s by a female band. For our second album, Hormonally Yours, we‚Äôd had this lofty idea to acquire the rights to Cat-Women of the Moon, a fabulously kitsch 3D B-movie from 1953, and build songs around its narrative. The record company said no ‚Äì they‚Äôre not known for their creative thinking are record companies ‚Äì but we‚Äôd written half a dozen songs already, so carried on. If I remember rightly ‚Äì 30 years is a long time ‚Äì the idea for Stay‚Äôs lyric came from a woman in the film who had to go back to her planet and leave her human love behind. I was worried about it being too saccharine, but alongside Chris Thomas we had Alan Moulder. He‚Äôd recently worked with My Bloody Valentine and the Jesus and Mary Chain, who I loved. At that point, we were the only ‚Äúpop‚Äù band Alan had ever worked with ‚Äì and he went on to work with Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails. It meant there was nothing sugary about the production. Sophie Muller , who was my best friend at the time, made the video. We were muses to each other. I‚Äôd been getting into gothic ringlets and sparkly glam-rock catsuits, enjoying becoming an unhinged Victorian heroine meets Suzi Quatro meets Labelle! Now that look was combined with me becoming the angel of death in the video, in dark makeup coming down the stairs from another dimension, trying to steal Marcella‚Äôs human love away from her ‚Äì the video had a slightly different concept to the song. We only had a day for the shoot. Most of it involved recording Marcy singing, so by the evening I was getting bored ‚Äì but also the clock was ticking. At 8pm, I hit the vodka and by the time we filmed, I was, shall we say, in high spirits, in full deranged splendour. Performing as a darker character is always more fun than being peaches and cream. I loved coming down the staircase, which was inspired by one of my favourite films, Powell and Pressburger‚Äôs A Matter of Life and Death. That character seemed to register with lots of people, which was amazing ‚Äì there were lots of ludicrous takes on it [by French and Saunders as well as David Baddiel and Rob Newman]. I found that funny and the greatest compliment. Funnier still is how people expect me to be just like the angel of death in real life, 30 years on. They‚Äôre bitterly disappointed when I‚Äôm not. Hormonally Yours is released in a 2-CD deluxe edition and coloured vinyl on 17 February, the 30th anniversary of its release.

2/8/2022,"Presidential records including ‚Äúlove letters‚Äù from Kim Jong-un had to be retrieved from Mar-a-Lago after Donald Trump improperly removed them from the White House, the Washington Post reported on Monday.  According to the Post, advisers to the former president ‚Äúdenied any nefarious intent and said the boxes contained mementos, gifts, letters from world leaders and other correspondence. ‚ÄúThe items included correspondence with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, which Trump once described as ‚Äòlove letters‚Äô, as well as a letter left for his successor by Barack Obama.‚Äù Presidents traditionally leave a note for their Oval Office successor. Despite claiming the election was stolen from him, Trump left one for Joe Biden, which the current president has called both ‚Äúvery generous‚Äù and ‚Äúprivate‚Äù. The National Archives and a Trump spokesman did not comment on the Post report. The records were returned to the Archives in January, the Post said. Trump‚Äôs treatment of White House records has been under the spotlight, amid a House investigation into the January 6 insurrection he incited. Trump went to the supreme court but failed to stop records being transferred to the House committee. Some records the panel obtained were reportedly ripped up and taped back together ‚Äì according to Trump‚Äôs widely reported practice. Lindsay Chervinski, a presidential historian, told the Post: ‚ÄúThe only way that a president can really be held accountable long term is to preserve a record about who said what, who did what, what policies were encouraged or adopted, and that is such an important part of the long-term scope of accountability ‚Äì beyond just elections and campaigns.‚Äù Lack of access to documents about issues of national security could ‚Äúpose a real concern if the next administration is flying blind without that information‚Äù, Chervinski said. Trump‚Äôs correspondence with Kim, during attempts to negotiate with the North Korean leader over his nuclear ambitions and threat to the US homeland and world peace, was the subject of widespread conjecture ‚Äì and ridicule. In September 2018, Trump told a rally in West Virginia: ‚ÄúWe fell in love. No, really. He wrote me beautiful letters.‚Äù The Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward later obtained 25 letters between Trump and Kim for his second book on the Trump presidency, Rage. His publisher, Simon & Schuster, described ‚Äúan extraordinary diplomatic minuet‚Äù. In one letter, about a meeting in Singapore in June 2018, Kim wrote: ‚ÄúEven now I cannot forget that moment of history when I firmly held Your Excellency‚Äôs hand at the beautiful and sacred location as the whole world watched.‚Äù After a summit in Vietnam in February 2019, Kim wrote that ‚Äúevery minute we shared 103 days ago in Hanoi was also a moment of glory that remains a precious memory‚Äù. The summits did not reduce tensions with North Korea. On Monday, Stephanie Murphy, a Florida Democrat on the 6 January committee, told the Post that the Trump White House ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt follow rules is not a shock. ‚ÄúAs for how this development relates to the committee‚Äôs work, we have different sources and methods for obtaining documents and information that we are seeking.‚Äù",News/US news,Trump papers including Kim ‚Äòlove letters‚Äô retrieved from Mar-a-Lago,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/07/trump-papers-kim-love-letters-national-archives-mar-a-lago
2/8/2022,"The home nations and Ireland are to launch a joint bid for the men‚Äôs European Championship in 2028 after plans to host the 2030 World Cup were abandoned. The decision was made after a feasibility study into the 2030 tournament found ‚Äúmany areas of uncertainty‚Äù according to the Football Association‚Äôs chief executive, Mark Bullingham. A 2030 bid was proposed by the Conservative government in its 2019 manifesto and was described last year as ‚Äúthe right time‚Äù to ‚Äúbring football home‚Äù by the prime minister, Boris Johnson.  ‚ÄúWe think it‚Äôs a brilliant opportunity for the five federations and governments to come together,‚Äù Bullingham said of the 2028 bid. ‚ÄúThis is the third biggest sports event in the world and we‚Äôve got a good opportunity to bring it to our collective countries and make a massively positive impact.‚Äù Bullingham said the feasibility study had concluded there was little financial difference in bidding for the World Cup over the European Championship. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve looked at two fantastic events in the World Cup and men‚Äôs Euros, both of them are multi-billion impact events to our country, they‚Äôve also got a similar return on investment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe World Cup is more expensive to bid for and to host, but also generates more revenue. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a very clear bidding landscape and timeline for the Euros. When we assess everything we know we can put together a highly competitive bid. With the World Cup there‚Äôs many areas of uncertainty, in terms of the timeline [and] in terms of the frequency of the events and so on.‚Äù The expectation that a feasibility study would find against a 2030 bid has been growing for months, largely due to the political background that often determines the choice of the winners. Spain and Portugal are expected to make a joint bid for 2030 which has already garnered favour with Uefa, while a joint South American proposal, on the centenary of the first World Cup in Uruguay, is likely to gain strong backing. There also remains broader tension between Uefa and Fifa over the latter‚Äôs plan for a biennial World Cup. Bullingham, who claims to have received positive noises from Uefa over a 2028 bid, said competing to host the Euros in the same year as Fifa has proposed to launch a biennial World Cup shows how unlikely it is to happen in the view of the FA. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt believe that [will] come to fruition,‚Äù he said. Bullingham‚Äôs confidence in a 2028 bid was shared by the heads of the Scottish, Welsh, Northern Irish and Irish associations, which will all contribute even though Northern Ireland does not have a stadium large enough to host tournament football and the total number of matches remains uncertain. All are enthusiastic regarding the benefits the tournament would bring, not just in terms of direct revenues but also from helping to regenerate the coffers of Uefa, whose resources have been drained by Covid and whose funding mechanisms offer vital support to smaller federations such as Wales. While the English FA has made its decision known to the UK government, the full support of Westminster has yet to be confirmed. A statement from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: ‚ÄúFollowing a full feasibility study, and in light of the current uncertainty around the future format of the tournament, we accept the conclusion of the five Football Associations that now is not the moment to proceed with a bid. We remain passionate about bringing a World Cup to the UK and Ireland when the time is right.‚ÄúMeanwhile, the Uefa European Championships are one of the biggest global sporting events. Hosting the full tournament would be an exciting opportunity, bringing significant benefits to the whole of the UK and Ireland. That is why we have initiated work to explore the possibility of bidding to host Euro 2028. We hope to be able to confirm government support for a bid in the coming weeks.‚Äù",Sport/Football,UK and Ireland to launch bid for Euro 2028 after ditching World Cup plans,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/07/uk-and-ireland-to-launch-bid-for-euro-2028-after-ditching-world-cup-plans
