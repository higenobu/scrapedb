1/31/2022,"A heavily edited version of the Sue Gray report into alleged parties inside Downing Street and Whitehall during lockdown will be published later on Monday, No 10 has said, after a copy was sent to Boris Johnson. It appears likely that many of the most serious allegations will not be considered in the version of the report that will be released, because of a request by the Metropolitan police, which launched a parallel investigation last week.  Johnson will give a Commons statement, expected at around 3.30pm, about an hour after the report is published on the gov.uk website and issued to MPs, No 10 said. At about 11.30, the Cabinet Office said that Gray, a senior civil servant, had sent her report to Johnson, saying in a statement: “We can confirm that Sue Gray has provided an update on her investigations to the prime minister.” The wording of “update” rather than “report” suggests the document Johnson has received is some way from the full findings gathered by Gray. While the report had been seen as potentially crucial as to whether Johnson remains in office, with a number of his MPs poised to move against the prime minister if it appears he has lied or misled parliament, the report as sent is set to miss out many significant facts. The full report had been nearly ready last week. However, the decision of the Met to investigate alleged offences means what has been sent to Johnson is expected to include minimal mention of a series of alleged social events. Johnson’s official spokesman said all that Gray sent would be published in full, but declined to say whether her full findings would be released once any Met police investigation was completed. “At this stage, we will need to consider what might be appropriate, and we will be discussing with the independent Cabinet Office team in due course about what might be appropriate,” he said. “But at the moment it’s unclear how the ongoing Met police investigation might interact with any further work on that.” The Met asked Gray last week to make “minimal reference” in her inquiry report to matters its officers were investigating, which are expected to be the most serious allegations. When allegations of parties first emerged, Johnson told parliament he had obeyed all lockdown rules, and that he knew nothing of any parties at No 10, even though subsequent evidence showed he had personally attended what appeared to be social events. A prime minister misleading parliament is regarded as a resignation issue. Downing Street has promised that Johnson will make a Commons statement after seeing the report, and he is expected to do so on Monday afternoon. Speaking to reporters on a visit to Essex on Monday, Johnson insisted he had been truthful, saying: “I stick absolutely to what I’ve said in the past.” Asked about warnings that the inquiry would be a whitewash because of the changes, he said: “You are going to have to wait and see both what Sue says and, of course, what the Met says.” Many Conservative MPs have been waiting to see if the findings include evidence of rule-breaking or misleading statements by the prime minister. If 54 Tory MPs submit letters to Graham Brady, the chair of the influential 1922 Committee, Johnson will face a vote of no confidence. However, if much of the report is missing due to the police investigation, many might find it hard to reach a conclusion, giving the PM some respite. The investigation, launched in December, was led originally by Simon Case, the cabinet secretary. He stepped down from the inquiry soon after the process began after reports that his office also held a social event. Gray, who was director general of propriety and ethics in the Cabinet Office from 2012 to 2018, took over the inquiry in mid-December.",News/Politics,Sue Gray report on Downing Street party allegations sent to PM,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/31/sue-gray-report-on-downing-street-party-allegations-sent-to-pm
1/31/2022,"Did you change what you ate or drank for January? The start of the year is an annual cue for a Pandora’s box of diet demons to be released; from meal replacements and super-keto diets to slimming teas. Alongside these trends live the regular and more ethical health-conscious messages of dry January and Veganuary, both of which have grown in popularity and have a much cleaner public image. Despite that, they are still not perfect. So this year I’d like to propose another idea that hopefully has longer staying power: call it the “real food revolution”.  The premise of Veganuary is simple: use the pivotal month of January to make a big change to your diet, your health and the planet’s health by cutting out animal products. Veganuary is a not-for-profit charitable company that provides recipes and motivational emails to help you give up meat and dairy products for just one month, with, ideally, positive effects on your waistline and your carbon footprint. Overall, they do a great job, and there is plenty of evidence to support the efficacy of reducing animal-based foods for our health and our planet’s survival. We now know that agriculture is responsible for about 25% of global heating and the single most important action we as individuals can do to help address the climate crisis is not to give up cars, but to eat less meat. That said, I have two issues with Veganuary. First, dietary change should aim for a long-term, sustainable change rather than a one-month quick fix. Second, there is no clear evidence that strict veganism is better for health than vegetarianism, pescatarianism or flexitarianism (a diet where you’re allowed to eat occasional meat or fish). Second, it fuels the perception that all plant-based foods are healthier than all animal-derived ones, which is not always true. If people replace fish, meat, eggs and cheese with plant-based ultra-processed foods, it might actually do us – and the planet – more harm than good. What do I mean by ultra-processed foods? These are the things that have undergone such extensive change that you wouldn’t be able to reproduce them at home. An easy way to identify them is from the extensive list of ingredients, many of which are unrecognisable; or from their aggressive marketing; or from their high fat, sugar and salt content. For the average person in the UK, 56% of their diet comes from these ultra-processed foods, which are known to damage people’s physical and mental health, and our environment. The ultra-processed food industry is astute at picking up on trends in order to cash in on them. The ethical impulse to be kinder to animals and the planet is one of those trends. Bloomberg Intelligence predicts 451% growth for the plant-based food market by 2030 (already worth $29bn in 2020). Processed food companies are getting a slice of this by mass-producing vast quantities of plant-based burgers, mince, nuggets, pies, quiches, vegan cheeses and more, all assembled in industrial energy-guzzling factories. The products often use extracted or isolated plant proteins (frequently from peas or soy), which produce waste. Although the average carbon footprint of plant-based meals remains far lower than that of their animal-based equivalents, there is something else that has an even lower environmental impact and is far better for our health: it is called “whole unprocessed food”. That means fruits, vegetables, pulses and nuts that are bought as whole as possible. And there are important scientific reasons why they are better for us. A lot of it comes down to the gut: we know that having a flourishing, diverse microbiome – the community of trillions of gut microbes in your lower intestine – is important for all aspects of health. Unprocessed foods contain two key ingredients that help support this. The first comes in the form of polyphenols: chemicals used naturally by plants as defences against pests. The second is fibre, which gives plants their structure. Microbes in the gut find both of these things delicious, feeding on them and in turn producing a range of important chemicals the body needs to stay healthy. Variety is important, too: the more different plants you can get your hands on with different polyphenols in them, the greater the variety of beneficial microorganisms in your gut you’ll be supporting. In processed food, fibre or polyphenols are usually stripped, pressurised or heated away. The odd vitamin that might be added back in, so that the product can be marketed as “healthy”, cannot make up for the loss. Next January (well, there’s nothing to stop you from starting this February, actually), instead of eating artificial meat substitutes and vegan cupcakes for a month, why not add a new type of plant to your diet every day? Instead of obsessing about reducing calories and shedding pounds or inches, how about decreasing the number of factory-produced ultra-processed foods in your home with every weekly shop? Instead of demonising all animal products, you could try reducing your meat consumption while focusing on quality products from those companies that are farming regeneratively and fishing responsibly. Instead of buying ready meals, consider cutting out food in packets and teaching children to peel an orange or a banana instead. Eating more “real” food is the most scientifically backed way to live longer, healthier lives. Big change requires bold thinking, sure, but transformation requires consistent, sustainable change – to be implemented every day, one step at a time, with our own personal circumstances and limitations in mind. One month of change is not enough to break habits built up over a lifetime. But it’s enough to open up new possibilities. Every revolution, including this one, has to start somewhere.

1/31/2022,"Brother to the more famous Alessandro, who composed more than 60 operas, and uncle to Domenico, whose 555 sonatas are one of the mainstays of the baroque keyboard repertoire, Francesco Scarlatti spent his life as a choir master, first in his native Sicily, and later in the British Isles, where his music was performed in London and at the Three Choirs festival; he apparently died in poverty in Dublin in 1741. Francesco’s own music is hardly known today, but one of the Armonico Consort’s earliest concerts, 20 years ago, included both of his surviving large-scale choral works, a Dixit Dominus and a Mass. As part of the group’s 20th anniversary season they have programmed the two again, before recording them. The pieces both date from the early 1700s, when Scarlatti was maestro di cappella in Palermo; they are written for a 16-part choir, divided into four groups, with an orchestra of strings and trumpet. But as these performances under Armonico’s director Christopher Monks vividly demonstrated, those forces are often employed in a strikingly distinctive way. In the Dixit Dominus psalm setting verses for the full forces, sometimes fugal and occasionally densely chromatic, are interspersed not with the usual solo numbers but with sections highlighting each of the voice types in turn, while the mass draws very selectively on the full Latin mass – there’s no Credo or Agnus Dei – though the use of antiphonal effects and the deployment of solo voices is just as striking.  The crisp, sparkling accounts of the two Scarlatti works were each preceded by violin concertos from the same era, with Rachel Podger as the soloist – the 12th of Vivaldi’s Op 4 set La Stravaganza, and Bach’s A minor concerto, BWV 1041. Accompanied by just a handful of strings and continuo, they were full of carefully defined detail and easy give-and-take, the best kind of intimate period-instrument performances.

1/31/2022,"Washington and its allies have prepared a list of Russian elites in or near Vladimir Putin’s inner circle who would be hit with economic sanctions if the Kremlin were to order an invasion of Ukraine, according to a US briefing. The language in the briefing by a US official to Reuters is notably similar to that used on Sunday by the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who said Britain would introduce legislation to allow banks, energy companies and “oligarchs close to the Kremlin” to be targeted by London, and makes clear the targeting is coordinated internationally.  Names were not made available but the official said the sanctions list would consist of elite figures – or oligarchs – plus their family members. “There is a broad list of individuals we can pull from,” the official told Reuters, noting that some would be from a classified list of senior Russian political figures and oligarchs outlined in section 241 of the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act in a report sent to the US Congress in 2018. “Putin’s cronies will no longer be able to use their spouses or other family members as proxies to evade sanctions. Sanctions would cut them off from the international financial system and ensure that they and their family members will no longer able to enjoy the perks of parking their money in the west and attending elite western universities,” the official added. The UK’s announcement of new legislation targeting Russian entities and people drew a fierce response from the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, who described the proposed measures as an “outright attack on business” and threatened retaliation. “The statements made in London are very disquieting,” Peskov said during a telephone briefing. “I believe they not just make us, our companies, worry, they also demonstrate a significant degree of London’s unpredictability, which is a reason for serious concern of international financial institutions and business entities.” Peskov did not specifically respond to threats against wealthy Russians close to Putin, but he described the threat of sanctions as illegitimate, saying they would harm Russian and British business interests. “We should call a spade a spade: sanctions are something legitimate, formalised by a resolution of the UN security council, while here we are dealing with an outright attack on business,” he said during the call.",News/World news,US to target Putin’s inner circle with sanctions in event of Ukraine invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/31/us-to-target-putins-inner-circle-with-sanctions-in-event-of-ukraine-invasion
1/31/2022,"Donald Trump was accused of “saying the quiet part loud” on Sunday night, when he protested that Mike Pence, his former vice-president, could have overturned his election defeat by Joe Biden.  Though he has appeared to admit Biden won before, Trump usually insists he won and his opponent stole the election through voter fraud – the “big lie” which animates rallies like one in Conroe, Texas, on Saturday. On Sunday Trump attempted to seize on moves by a bipartisan group of senators to reform the Electoral Count Act of 1887, which Trump tried to use to have Pence refuse to certify Biden’s victory. Pence concluded he did not have the authority to do so. On the same day, 6 January 2021, supporters Trump told to “fight like hell” attacked the US Capitol. Seven people died and more than 100 police officers were hurt. More than 700 people have been charged, 11 with seditious conspiracy. Trump and his aides are the target of congressional investigation. But Trump survived impeachment when enough Senate Republicans stayed loyal and is free to run for office. On Saturday, he promised pardons for 6 January rioters if re-elected and exhorted followers to protest against investigations of his business and political affairs in New York and Georgia. In a statement on Sunday, Trump claimed “fraud and many other irregularities” in the 2020 election – no large-scale fraud has been found – and asked: “How come the Democrats and … Republicans, like Wacky Susan Collins, are desperately trying to pass legislation that will not allow the vice-president to change the results of the election? “Actually, what they are saying, is that Mike Pence did have the right to change the outcome, and they now want to take that right away. Unfortunately, he didn’t exercise that power. He could have overturned the election!” Collins, of Maine, was one of seven Republicans to vote to convict Trump over the Capitol attack. Such is his grip on her party, on Sunday she would not say she would not support him if he ran again. But she did tell ABC why she wanted to reform the Electoral Count Act. “We saw, on 6 January 2021, how ambiguities, simple law, were exploited. We need to prevent that from happening again. I’m hopeful that we can come up with a bipartisan bill that will make very clear that the vice-president’s role is simply ministerial, that he has no ability to halt the count.” Dick Durbin of Illinois, a member of Democratic Senate leadership, said reform to the electoral college process was merited because Trump gambits including false slates of electors “really raise a question about the integrity of that process. It hasn’t been looked at for 150 years. Now’s the time.” Pundits seized on Trump’s latest apparent blunder into the truth. Bill Kristol, a conservative writer, said: “Talk about saying the quiet part loud. Trump here admits or rather boasts [about] what he wanted Mike Pence to do.” Chris Krebs, fired as head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency under Trump but who pronounced the 2020 election “the most secure in US history”, said: “In the last 24 hours the former president: (1) floated pardons for [January 6] defendants, (2) encouraged civil unrest if he’s indicted in [Georgia or New York], (3) once again confirmed he pressured Pence to overturn a lawful election. “He’s radicalizing his base to be his personal Brown Shirts.” Olivia Troye, a former Pence aide, wrote: “Every Republican candidate and official should go on record with their answer: Do you support sedition and pardoning domestic terrorists?”",News/US news,Quiet part loud: Trump says Pence ‘could have overturned the election’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/31/donald-trump-mike-pence-overturn-election

1/31/2022,"Erotic body painting, deadly scorpions, Italian futurism, a ninja stuntman, a Warholian MacGuffin, the singer Anastacia, not one organised-crime faction but four: incorporating all the above and more, this art world-set thriller told non-linear-style believes it’s a scrambled cubist masterpiece. But in truth it is closer to an abstract expressionist hot mess, as writer-director Alessio Della Valle splatters his canvas with everything he can lay his hands on and sees what sticks. As if he’s force-feeding us the whole of Pulp Fiction in the first 15 minutes, Della Valle initially hops between three characters homing in on the botched exchange of a stolen print of Andy Warhol’s Pink Marilyn: a failed stuntman and would-be courier (Jeremy Piven), his high-class art dealer brother (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and a shoddy bagman (Fortunato Cerlino). But goons sent by Emile Hirsch’s junior mafia don – who wants his artwork back – seize the wrong package. The ensuing mayhem lets Della Valle erratically collage even more elements: Meyers’ dodgy counterfeiting past; his smoking-hot affair with a Spanish restorer (Paz Vega); Hirsch’s Michael Corleone-esque misgivings about the family trade and artistic aspirations (he likes firing his assault rifle at his easel); Michael Madsen, included for reasons indeterminate, with a voice like a dodgy motorbike throttle.  The plot is semi-incomprehensible, but the fragmented effect is not unpleasing. It isn’t capable, though, of carrying American Night’s intellectual pretensions, which are signposted in chapter titles such as “Art + Life”. What this gaudy rampage feels like is a commentary on the covetousness and inflationary madness of the art market itself. It’s telling that, beyond brash slogans and some gangster-film freeze frames, Della Valle’s film has no discernible style, with uncertain camerawork and attempts at Tarantino-esque black comedy – such as Cerlino’s narcoleptic bagman – getting lost in the chaos. Rhys-Meyers brings some substance, with his sophisticate’s gravelly tones suggesting despair behind the veneer. And even if American Night flirts constantly with ludicrousness, it is never boring.

1/31/2022,"After two years of the pandemic and largely socially distanced gigs, the scenes here feel surreal. Every inch of the sold-out, ram-packed venue hosts a heaving body. Hair is flailed and heads are banged. A succession of fans – many of them upside down, chunky footwear in the air – crowdsurf towards the stage, where they are helped down by security. Some people manage to actually get on the stage itself, launching themselves skyward back into the heaving throng.  The jubilant atmosphere is partly informed by this week’s abandonment of Covid restrictions – only the venue’s powerful new ventilation system suggests anything has changed since 2020 – but also reflects how the Baltimore, Maryland band have become arguably the current hardcore punk scene’s most exciting band. Turnstile certainly stepped up a level with last year’s eclectic third album, Glow On, which combines hardcore with elements of soul, psychedelia and at least one Latin-funk breakdown. Being unable to tour it until now means Turnstile hit the stage with the ferocity of uncaged wild animals. There is barely a second’s pause between each song, as if the five-piece – all splayed legs and raised hoods – are racing against more than the early curfew. There are briefs forays into electronica and Underwater Boi and Alien Love Call detour into sparkling dream-pop, but with drummer Daniel Fang beating up a storm, live the focus is on riffs and rocking hard.

1/31/2022,"Norma Waterson, whose bracingly beautiful singing made her a key figure in British folk music alongside her siblings Mike and Lal and husband Martin Carthy, has died aged 82. Folk musician daughter Eliza Carthy wrote on Facebook: “Not much to say about such monumental sadness, but mam passed away yesterday afternoon, January 30th 2022.”  Waterson had recently been hospitalised with pneumonia. The family was crowdfunding for her treatment and support for Martin Carthy, amid financial difficulty during the pandemic which had prevented them from earning on tour. Waterson was born in Hull in 1939, and was orphaned along with Mike and Lal and raised by their grandmother. They started out playing skiffle, then formed the Watersons with cousin John Harrison. With their stirring, unadorned vocal harmonising, sometimes without instrumental backing, the group helped to repopularise British folk music during the 1960s with a string of albums beginning with 1965’s Frost and Fire: A Calendar of Ceremonial Folk Songs. They split in 1968, with Norma moving to the tiny Caribbean island of Montserrat to work as a radio DJ, but after her return to the UK the Watersons reformed in the early 1970s with Martin Carthy, formerly of folk revivalist peers Steeleye Span, replacing Harrison. Lal and Mike also wrote original material, resulting in classic albums such as 1972’s Bright Phoebus, which Norma guests on. The Watersons continued to record throughout the 1980s, before Norma, Martin and Eliza formed Waterson: Carthy in the mid-1990s. Waterson also released three solo albums in the late 90s and early 00s – her self-titled 1996 debut was nominated for the Mercury prize – and then two further releases in collaboration with Eliza. In 2010, a serious illness left her in a coma. She recovered, but had to learn to walk and talk again. Among those paying tribute was Billy Bragg, who called Waterson “one of the defining voices of English traditional music”.",Arts/Music,"Norma Waterson, celebrated British folk singer, dies aged 82",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/31/norma-waterson-celebrated-british-folk-singer-dies-aged-82
1/31/2022,"In the example clues below, I explain the two parts of each: there is a definition of the answer and there is some wordplay – a recipe for assembling its letters. In a genuine puzzle environment, of course, you also have the crossing letters, which hugely alleviate your solving load. Hence “crossword”. Also, the setters’ names tend to link to profiles of the individuals behind the pseudonyms. The first words Inspector Morse says to DS Lewis are about a crossword clue. “Have a look at 14 down.” Fourteen down, Lewis sees, is:  Take in bachelor? It could do (3) Morse has written BRA. Lewis isn’t sure what to say, so Morse airily dissects the clue: ‘“Bachelor” – that’s BA and “take” is the letter “r”, recipe in Latin. Did you never do any Latin?’‘No, sir.’‘Do you think I’m wasting your time, Lewis?’Lewis was nobody’s fool and was a man of some honesty and integrity. ‘Yes, sir.’ This is when they know the partnership will work. The writer Colin Dexter devised a clue that demonstrates well the quirks a beginner needs to get his or her head round as the fun starts. “Bachelor” for BA is fair enough, if a little tweedy – but Lewis is not expected to know that “recipe” is the second singular present imperative for “take”, nor that doctors have long written the charming symbol ℞ (an R with a cross through it to indicate that it’s an abbreviation) to mean “take” in a prescription. At least the answer is a normal word. Here are some other Latin abbreviations that setters find handy and solvers quickly regard as second nature. As we see on letterboxes, ER II and GR VI indicate monarchs Elizabeth and George via regina and rex. Hence the pillow that we are told belonged to Minder fan Prince Philip with the motto “ER II INDOORS”. So when Vlad mentions this hapless monarch … 26a Anger that king has broken a bone (7)[ definition: a bone ][ wordplay: synonym for “anger” (as a verb), “broken into by” abbrev for “king” ][ STIR UP containing R ] … we turn him into an R before getting the bone in the ear we call a STIRRUP. Once upon a time, a writer might refer you to another text by telling you in Latin to go “see” it: vide (as in video) or more curtly, “V”. In crosswords, we pretend this is still the case. So it is with this clue from late setter (and former National Union of Teachers president) Rover … 9a See Ingrid worried about using the car (7)[ definition: using the car ][ wordplay: anagram (“worried”) of abbrev for “see” & INGRID ][ anagram of VINGRID ] … for DRIVING. A more familiar one, now, although one that gov.uk is phasing out with the advice “Try (re)writing sentences to avoid the need to use it”. So, when Boatman says “that is”, he wants you to change it via id est to IE … 17d Wait around – that is an intimately touching thing (8)[ definition: an intimately touching thing ][ wordplay: synonym for “wait around” + abbrev for “that is” ][ LINGER + IE ] … to obtain some LINGERIE. When Lionel Bart’s furious producer Joan Littlewood yelled about the damage done to him by LSD, onlooker Barbara Windsor remarked: “That’s not fair. We’re all in it for the money, aren’t we?” Windsor knew that the “D” in the old abbreviation for “pounds, shillings and pence” was for a penny – from the Latin denarius. And so “coin”, “penny” or “pence” may be asking you to look for a D, as with this clue from the recently departed Chifonie … 6d Flirting gets Penny a relationship (9)[ definition: flirting ][ wordplay: abbrev for “penny” + synonym for “a relationship” ][ D + ALLIANCE ] … for DALLIANCE. Of course, it could be a P, but not in this case as I don’t think PALLIANCE is a word. In 2011, the BBC’s religion and ethics microsite explained why it used “BCE” in place of “BC” in its discussion of various faiths. Boris Johnson wrote a 1,000-word response as if the letters “BC” without the “E” had been banned across radio and television, notable for the aside: “I am afraid my faith is like a very wonky aerial, and I sometimes find the signal pretty scratchy”. In crosswords, BCE would only really be useful for the answer JOBCENTRE; it’s AD that we encounter more often, though it takes a few examples before you intuitively try a leap from “now” or “these days” to the abbreviation for anno domini. Here’s Vulcan … 21d Very surprised these days to go round part of Hampton Court gardens (6)[ definition: very surprised ][ wordplay: abbrev for “these days” outside (“to go round”) something seen at Hampton Court ][ AD outside MAZE ] … leaving you AMAZED.

1/31/2022,"My friend Peter Greaves, who has died aged 89, was a health and nutrition officer for Unicef whose work made a huge difference to children’s lives around the world. He was an early advocate of low-cost interventions including immunisation, oral rehydration and breastfeeding. While he was Unicef’s chief nutrition adviser in the mid-1980s, he managed to get Unicef and the World Health Organization to agree on the final draft of The Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding. This document helped transform global maternal care policies.  Born in Cardiff, the son of Methodist missionaries, Stella (nee Cox) and Lionel Greaves, Peter spent much of his early childhood in Kenya. He boarded at Kingswood school, Bath, then went to Jesus College, Cambridge, to study biochemistry, graduating in 1955. This was followed by a PhD in nutrition at the Royal Free hospital, University College London – and a crash course in tank-driving during national service in Germany. From 1959 he was in Tanganyika (now Tanzania), for two years, as a senior scientific adviser at the East African Institute for Medical Research, before moving back to London to work at the British Nutrition Foundation. He joined the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in 1969, working first in Cairo, and then in Beirut as a health and nutrition officer. After three years working as the FAO adviser to Unicef New Delhi, he left that organisation to join Unicef full-time, where he spent the rest of his working life. In 1980 Peter became Unicef’s regional officer for South America in Brazil. There he set up a programme for street children in Rio, providing them with education, part-time work, a safe place to sleep and a hot meal. He also launched a highly successful breastfeeding programme. In 1983 his team developed a primary healthcare plan to tackle the appalling infant mortality rate in the poorest Brazilian state, Maranhão, resulting in a 33% reduction in infant mortality. The programme was taken up by the Brazilian government and extended across the whole country. He moved in 1984 from Brazil to the Unicef HQ in New York as chief nutrition adviser. His colleague Margaret Kyenkya-Isabitye recalled: “He was the backbone, the glue, that held the nutrition section together.” Peter’s commitment to good causes did not stop on his retirement in 1992. He joined the United Nations Association, which is how I met him, and campaigned on many issues, including climate change, and wrote regular letters to national newspapers (including his last one, published in the Guardian in November 2021). In the words of his son, Tim, “he is undoubtedly one of those rare people who has left this world a better, a more generous and kinder place than he found it”. He is survived by his wife, Chloe (nee Morgan), an actor whom he married in 1957, Tim, a daughter, Kate, and four grandchildren.",News/Global development,Peter Greaves obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/31/peter-greaves-obituary
1/31/2022,"A row has broken out between the world’s richest person, Elon Musk, and a 19-year-old student and aviation enthusiast from Florida. Jack Sweeney created the Twitter bot @ElonJet, which tracks Musk’s Gulfstream private jet and posts real-time updates of its location.  Musk, the co-founder and chief executive of Telsa and SpaceX, discovered the Twitter account and pleaded with Sweeney to delete it. “Can you take this down? It is a security risk,” Musk, who has amassed an estimated $220bn fortune, wrote in a direct messag to the teenager. “I don’t love the idea of being shot by a nutcase.” Landed near Harlingen, Texas, US.

It would be great support in college and would possibly allow me to get a car, maybe even a [Tesla] Model 3.” https://t.co/7NsEhVDKeu Musk replied that he would think about the offer, before declining, saying it “doesn’t feel right to pay to shut this down”. Sweeney said he had decided to go public with the correspondence in order to prompt Musk back to the negotiating table. “I’ve done a lot of work on this and 5k is not enough … ” he told Insider, “[to make up for] the fun I have in this, working on it. “He went the opposite way of me, so why wouldn’t I go the opposite way of him?” Sweeney said he had also offered to delete the account in return for an internship with Musk, but the billionaire had not responded to the offer. https://t.co/7NsEhVDKeu Sweeney said he created the account because he was a fan of Musk’s. “I knew he had the jet, and I just knew it would reveal what business is going on and where he is going and stuff,” he said.

1/31/2022,"My mother, Catherine Finegan, who has died aged 90, was a strong advocate for social justice in her adopted home of Birmingham, where she served as a city councillor for 20 years. On retirement, in recognition of all she had done for the city, she was made honorary alderman for Birmingham city council. When she was elected, in 1978, Catherine, who had never had a formal education, was working as a breakfast and silver service waitress at the Grand hotel on Colmore Row, Birmingham. She had became politically active during this time, leading two protests locally for safer streets during one of which she was arrested for obstructing a road. She also unionised the Grand hotel, and became involved with a social group for families with children with disabilities. It was through listening to their difficulties and the lack of support available to them that she joined the Labour party, and was eventually invited to stand in the local elections.  Born in Aughaville, Co Cork, Catherine was the eldest of eight surviving children of a farming couple, Mary (nee Ellen) and Jeremiah O’Driscoll. She attended the Dromore National school but effectively left education at eight years old due to a lung condition, bronchiectasis. Her first paid job was as a nanny, at 13; she worked as a housemaid and cook before leaving for England aged 22 to work as a cook/housekeeper. In 1954, Catherine moved to Birmingham to work as a “clippie” (conductor) on the buses. There she met James Finegan, from Monaghan. They married that November and settled in the suburb of Alum Rock, where they raised their six children. He got a job at Rootes car factory. Over the following years, Catherine worked at various factories, as a hospital auxiliary, and as a barmaid. In 1973 she finally settled into regular work at the Grand hotel, where she stayed until 1994. She began studying during this time, gaining O- and A-levels at Matthew Boulton College in 1976. She also took classes in tailoring and design, and began taking commissions to make suits, dresses and wedding dresses. She also did piecework for fashion boutiques in the city centre, including Chelsea Girl. In 1977 she began a humanities degree with the Open University, but, due to time constraints, had to give up the following year when she was elected to Birmingham city council, for Saltley ward. Catherine was particularly proud of her work with social services, visiting care homes. Her mantra was: “If it isn’t good enough for my mother then it isn’t good enough for anyone else’s mother!” She also supported the regeneration of Birmingham, and was on the commercial services committee when the Bull Ring redevelopment was approved in 1987, which brought 8,000 jobs to the city. In her retirement, Catherine sat on the fostering and adoption panel for social services. Jimmy died in 2009, and two grandchildren predeceased Catherine. She is survived by her children, Peter, Breda, Brendan, Gerard, Siobhan and me, 12 grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren, and by two sisters, Margaret and Philomena, and a brother, Peter.",News/Society,Catherine Finegan obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/31/catherine-finegan-obituary

1/31/2022,"My friend Penny Holbrook, who has died suddenly after a short illness aged 43, was a talented and energetic Labour member of Birmingham city council for almost 20 years. Penny was dedicated to the community she served, and driven by a commitment to social justice. Born and raised in north Birmingham, Penny was the daughter of Mollie (nee Anderton) and Doug Holbrook. The family lived in Erdington and later on the Falcon Lodge estate in Sutton Coldfield. She attended John Willmott school and studied politics and contemporary governance at the University of Central England (now Birmingham City University).  Penny worked in retail for Tesco while becoming increasingly active in the Labour party. In 2003, aged 25, she was elected councillor for Stockland Green ward, which she represented with just one short interlude until her death. She also worked in the offices of Sion Simon and Jack Dromey during their terms as MP for Birmingham Erdington between 2008 and 2014. In 2012, a newly elected Labour administration in Birmingham transferred a range of frontline council services to 10 district committees. As chair of the Erdington district Penny was a champion of devolution, working closely with residents to develop responses to unemployment locally and to keep services open despite central government austerity policies. In 2014 Penny joined the council’s cabinet, leading on skills, learning and culture. Her work in this helped to cut the number of young people not in education, employment or training. She also secured the future of the Library of Birmingham. The Labour administration had inherited the brand new (and very expensive) library, while at the same time having to deal with enormous budget cuts from central government. Penny worked to co-locate other services in the building, including the Brasshouse Language Centre, creating a vibrant hub of knowledge, learning and skills services and securing the library’s financial viability. She went on to chair the council’s housing and neighbourhoods scrutiny committee. In 2015, Penny stood for the leadership of the council and after a hotly contested campaign came just one vote short of victory. She was determined and had tremendous creative energy. Penny was honest and direct, but kind, compassionate and funny. This combination of characteristics enabled her to build coalitions and bring people together. Yet, as Jess Phillips MP put it: “Penny could never quite see how great she was.” Alongside her council work, Penny supported the Birmingham Poverty Truth Commission as a freelance consultant.Penny is survived by her mother and father, her sister, Vicky, and her niece, Coral.",News/Society,Penny Holbrook obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/31/penny-holbrook-obituary
