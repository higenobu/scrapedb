3/12/2022,"Russia has confirmed it used a deadly 'lung-busting' thermobaric bomb in Ukraine. It is believed the weapon - often called a vacuum bomb - was used in the Chernihiv region, 80 miles north of Kyiv. The area has been under fire for weeks and dozens of civilian deaths have been confirmed. The UK Ministry of Defence says their use is not illegal but they are heavily regulated. The weapons suck in oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion. They typically produce a blast wave that lasts significantly longer than that of a conventional explosive and are capable of vapourising human bodies. In warfare, they are often used in so-called ‘bunker buster’ roles, or to attack caves or tunnel systems. The term thermobaric comes from the Greek ‘therme’ and ‘baros’ meaning ‘heat’ and ‘pressure’. The MoD said they had been launched in Ukraine from a TOS-1A rocket launcher.

Then the cloud is detonated to create an incredibly powerful shock wave. The CIA says that such weapons can ‘obliterate’ people near the explosion and do significant damage to buildings. A CIA report says: “Those at the fringe are likely to suffer many internal, thus invisible injuries, including burst eardrums and crushed inner ear organs, severe concussions, ruptured lungs and internal organs, and possibly blindness.” Dr Patricia Lewis, Research Director for International Security at Chatham House, told LBC that the wide area of the ignited particles make them 'suck in' oxygen in the first stage of the blast. The blast from a thermobaric bomb is 'very sustained', Dr Lewis explains, and the weapons have become deadlier as the technology has developed. The weapons were first developed in the 1960s by both the USA and the Soviet Union, and have been widely used in Afghanistan. They are not illegal but they cannot be used against military targets in a way that may endanger the civilian population, or in a way that the damage they caused would be excessive to the military advantage gained. Purposefully using it against civilians is illegal.

3/12/2022,"Former Vice President Mike Pence has spent the past week outmaneuvering Donald Trump, his old boss and potential 2024 primary opponent. Shortly after the plane Trump was flying on last weekend was forced to land due to an engine failure, Pence flew to Israel on the private jet of the GOP’s most prized donor, Miriam Adelson. And while Trump was avoiding criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin in a call-in interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, Pence and his wife, Karen, flew to the border between Ukraine and Poland to distribute relief aid to refugees. In perhaps the most telling indication that the political dynamic between the two men has shifted, Pence implicitly hit Trump at a Republican National Committee speech last Friday, saying the GOP should not include any “apologists for Putin.” “Welcome to the front end of the Pence boomlet,” said veteran Republican pollster Michael Cohen, who has no relation to the former Trump lawyer. “Who had a better week or past few weeks than Pence? I mean, it’s not even close.” When Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine, he not only resolidified the old Western alliances formed in the wake of World War II, he also shook up the Republican Party’s power dynamics, at least temporarily. The longtime center of power on the right, Trump has been struggling to garner attention for himself after six years of almost unilaterally controlling the national stage. And Pence, who’s best known for being stiff, boring and deferential to the former president, has walked into the center of the vacuum created by Trump's absence. Pence has even grabbed prime slots on Fox News, making news in an interview with one of Trump’s favorite hosts, Maria Bartiromo. Bartiromo pressed Pence repeatedly on his plans for 2024, and whether he would run against Trump if the former president enters the race. But Pence played coy, brushing away the questions. “I’m confident the Republican Party will nominate a candidate who will be the next president of the United States of America, and at the right time, my family and I will reflect and consider how we might participate in that process,” Pence said. The burst of attention for Pence comes after more than a year of laying groundwork behind the scenes, making campaign-style trips to early-voting states like New Hampshire and Iowa and courting Republican donors who have bankrolled successful White House bids. Trump remains the leader in early polls for the 2024 party nomination, but despite his popularity with the Republican grassroots, a number of GOP lawmakers are mulling runs of their own. All are trying to develop their own unique brands, whether through Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s culture-war broadsides or Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton’s appeal to unite the pre- and post-Trump wings of the GOP. Yet despite his very public falling out with Trump, Pence's backers see him as a figure uniquely suited to bring together the warring factions within the GOP. An evangelical Christian originally elected to Congress in 2000, he steadily climbed the ranks of the House Republican caucus. In 2012, Indiana voters elected him governor, a position he left to become Trump’s running mate and shore up the erstwhile TV host’s conservative bona fides. Since the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection, in which Trump-backed rioters threatened to hang Pence for not helping the then president overturn the 2020 election results, Pence has been slowly and steadily hitting the campaign trail — even though he has yet to announce his intentions for 2024. A Pence spokesman did not respond to Yahoo News’ request for comment. But the real break in the dam seemed to come almost immediately after Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine. Trump and his backers, who just days earlier had been touting Putin’s “genius,” suddenly looked outdated and perhaps out of touch with the GOP. “The McCain wing of the GOP is back and stronger than ever, truth-telling about Mr. KGB,” said longtime Republican strategist Scott Reed, who ran Bob Dole’s campaign for president in 1996. But Republican operatives, like the candidates they advise, are still trying to game out whether the turn from Trump-style populism, at least in matters of foreign policy, is permanent or merely a passing fluke. “It’s too soon to tell, but I still think Americans don’t want U.S. troops over there, and a lot don’t want to even send money there,” said former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. “This could be an issue in the midterms.” Pence, meanwhile, is doing what he has always done, plodding forward steadily and waiting for his moments to grab the spotlight.",Politics/Yahoo News,Mike Pence knocks Trump and lays the groundwork for possible presidential run,https://news.yahoo.com/mike-pence-knocks-trump-and-lays-the-groundwork-for-possible-presidential-run-212200455.html
3/12/2022,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Army is comfortable with the way its light tank competition is progressing and plans to award a production contract this summer, according to service acquisition and program officials. Recent reports indicate the service may have already eliminated one of the two competitors from the Army’s Mobile Protected Firepower competition. Janes Defense first reported earlier this month that BAE Systems had been eliminated from the competition, leaving just General Dynamics Land Systems in the mix, with a few months left before the Army plans to select a winner. The Army would not confirm the validity of the reports but the service’s program executive officer for ground combat systems, Brig. Gen. Glenn Dean, told Defense News the Army is committed to the MPF program to fill a capability gap to provide mobile, protected, direct-fire capability to infantry soldiers. Dean said the source-selection phase of the competition is ongoing and the program is on schedule for a production decision in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 — around June. The plan is to equip the first unit with MPF by the fourth quarter of FY25. The Army plans to initially build 26 vehicles, with an option to build 28 more and retrofit eight prototypes. When asked about the status of the MPF program and the possible elimination of BAE Systems’ offering from the competition, Doug Bush, the Army’s acquisition chief, said he was satisfied with the MPF competition. “You always end up with one at some point. [There are] not two people making Abrams tanks,” he told a group of reporters at the McAleese & Associates defense conference in Washington on March 9. “We got what we needed out of the competition, which was prototypes that went through a full range of testing, limited-user testing, soldier touch points,” he added. “The benefits of competition, the Army realized them already, and once we are able to explain everything that happened, I think you’ll see that we had competition a long way into this. So I think we got there pretty well.” Dean confirmed to Defense News that the Army recently completed an Army Requirements Oversight Council review on MPF, which “validated the requirements and Army acquisition objective for that program.” Bush noted the MPF program has undergone several oversight council reviews, and that this time the Army assessed quantities and types of units to which the service would field MPF. In 2021, the systems went through a soldier vehicle assessment with the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, during which soldiers were tasked with validating the MPF concept and providing feedback on how the service should develop tactics, techniques and procedures for fighting with this capability. Later that year, in the fall, the competing light tank prototypes moved into the Army’s limited-user test, which marked the final step before the service would be able to decide on a winner. Both teams were selected in December 2018 to build and deliver 12 MPF prototypes. The two prototypes differed significantly. GDLS offered a new, lightweight chassis with a high-performance power pack and an advanced suspension, combined with a turret featuring the latest version of the fire control system found in the Abrams main battle tank. BAE Systems’ design is an updated M8 Buford armored gun system with new capabilities and components. The company experienced some prototype production delays due to the coronavirus pandemic, and it delivered systems for the soldier evaluation months later than GDLS. Soldiers wrapped up that portion of the assessment in early August 2021, according to Jim Miller, BAE’s senior director of business development for combat mission systems, who spoke to Defense News in October that year. While BAE struggled to get its prototypes to Bragg, once there, “everything went great,” Miller said. “We got really great feedback on the vehicle from the soldiers that operated it.” Soldiers made some minor suggestions, but overall “we had positive feedback about the performance of the vehicle,” Miller added. Bob Lennox, GDLS’ vice president of strategy and global growth, told Defense News last fall that the soldier assessment “was very valuable to us ... because we were there earlier than others, we were able to get the full benefit of that time of having the soldiers on the vehicle.”",Business/Defense News,US Army to award production contract for light tank this summer,https://news.yahoo.com/us-army-award-production-contract-202238056.html
3/12/2022,"By David Brunnstrom and Tim Ahmann WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States imposed fresh North Korea-related sanctions on Friday, targeting Russian individuals and companies after U.S. and South Korean officials said Pyongyang had used its largest intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) system in two recent launches. The sanctions, announced by the U.S. Treasury, targeted two Russian nationals and three Russian firms it linked to North Korea's procurement activities for its missile programs. The measures come amid concerns that North Korea may soon follow through on threats to resume full testing of long-range ICBMs and nuclear weapons for the first time since 2017. The U.S. Treasury named the Russians as Aleksandr Andreyevich Gayevoy and Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Chasovnikov, both of Vladivostok. It named the Russian firms as Apollon OOO, Zeel–M Co., Ltd, and RK Briz OOO. The individuals and companies could not immediately be reached for comment. ""The DPRK continues to launch ballistic missiles in blatant violation of international law, posing a grave threat to global security,"" U.S. Treasury Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson said in a statement, referring to North Korea by the initials of its official name. ""Today's actions respond to this threat by targeting a network of Russia-based individuals and entities complicit in helping the DPRK procure components for its unlawful ballistic missile systems,"" he added. The sanctions freeze any property held by the individuals or firms in the United States and prohibit business dealings with them. On Thursday, a senior U.S. official called the recent North Korean launches a ""serious escalation"" and said it was important for the international community to be united in opposing further development of such weapons. The official said the steps would be followed by a range of further actions in coming days. Past U.S. punitive steps and international sanctions at the United Nations have failed to arrest North Korea's weapons' development over the years and Russia and China, which backed U.N. sanctions after North Korea's last ICBM and nuclear tests in 2017, have since urged sanctions easing to encourage dialogue with North Korea. On Monday, the United States and 10 other countries bemoaned the failure of the U.N. Security Council to condemn North Korea's repeated missile launches this year, saying this eroded the credibility both of the council and the global non- proliferation regime. Russian media quoted a Russian foreign ministry official as saying on Tuesday that Russia understands North Korea's decision to renew frequent missile launches and sees no prerequisites to restart de-nuclearization talks.

3/12/2022,"STORY: President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday Ukraine had reached a ""strategic turning point"" in the conflict with Russia, as Russian forces bombarded cities across the country and appeared to be regrouping for a possible assault on the capital Kyiv. “It is impossible to say how many days we still have to free Ukrainian land. But we can say we will do it because we want it. We have already reached a strategic turning point, we are moving towards our goal, towards our victory."" Russia's main attack force has been stalled on roads north of Kyiv, but cities around Ukraine are under bombardment. Officials in Kharkiv said a psychiatric hospital had been hit and about 50 schools had been destroyed there. In Mariupol, the city council said at least 1,500 civilians had been killed from shelling, and a 12-day blockade that has left hundreds of thousands trapped with no food, water, heat or power. Russia's defense ministry said the Black Sea port was now completely surrounded and Ukrainian officials accused Russia of deliberately preventing civilians getting out and humanitarian convoys getting in. Moscow denies it has been targeting civilians in what it calls a ""special operation"" to disarm and ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine. As the violence intensifies, Ukrainians lined up at the Polish border...to return home and fight. JOURNALIST ASKING: Are you scared? UKRAINIAN IRINA SHVED, 28: “Scared? Of course, scared.
