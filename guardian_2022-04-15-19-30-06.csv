4/15/2022,"Not content with staging Chris Bush’s lucid new adaptation of Jane Eyre, the Stephen Joseph theatre is throwing on a whole Brontë festival. On the streets of Scarborough, Lisa Cagnacci’s audio walking tour gives you a blast of constitutional sea air before leading you up the hill to Anne Brontë’s grave. Back in the theatre, there are film screenings, children’s play sessions and, on Thursday, a brilliant lecture on Charlotte Brontë by Sassy Holmes of the Brontë Parsonage Museum. She makes connections between Jane Eyre and Taylor Swift’s Invisible String by way of Cary Joji Fukunaga’s 2011 movie, before picking apart the protofeminist significance of the oft-quoted “Reader, I married him”. She also points out that, in Zoë Waterman’s fluid production, Eleanor Sutton plays not only the lead role but also Bertha Mason, the mad woman in the attic. It is as if Bertha is a projection of Jane’s animal nature; less a character than a symbol of repressed instinct. In this Beauty and the Beast narrative, it isn’t only the untamed Edward Rochester who must conquer his demons. Elsewhere, this Jane Eyre is in control – so much so that when Bush’s adaptation kicks off at too brisk a pace, Jane stops the show and insists on a rewind. She is a woman determined to be at the heart of her own story. “I must have action,” she tells Sam Jenkins-Shaw’s Rochester. “And if I cannot find it, I will make it.” That makes her relationship with Rochester all the more gripping. Sutton, with her hair pinned back and eyes heavy, has a plain-speaking severity. Not until after the interval does she allow herself a proper smile. In her grey dress, she is an austere match for Jenkins-Shaw in his dark coat and high boots. He is similarly direct, but behind his bluntness lies an intelligence to match hers. For all Rochester’s faults, Jenkins-Shaw makes him seem worthy of Jane’s attentions. The in-the-round staging is light on its feet, the six-strong ensemble playing multiple parts, frequently carrying a musical instrument as they go. Simon Slater’s wistful folk tunes intercut the action, allowing moments of reflection in a brooding study of morality and desire.  Jane Eyre is at the Stephen Joseph theatre, Scarborough, until 30 April, and at the New Vic theatre, Newcastle-under-Lyme, 4–28 May.

4/15/2022,"Hello and good morning, Russia’s Black Sea flagship missile cruiser, the Moskva, has sunk while being towed to a port after an explosion, according to the Russian defence ministry. It comes after Ukraine said on Wednesday its military struck the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles, while distracting its crew with a drone, causing it to start sinking and forcing the crew of 500 to abandon ship. The Russian defence ministry said on Thursday: “The cruiser ship Moskva lost its stability when it was towed to the port because of the damage to the ship’s hull that it received during the fire from the detonation of ammunition. In stormy sea conditions, the ship sank.” Is Russia’s claim about a “storm” true? The claim of bad weather being a factor was questioned by observers. “Looking at the weather report outside of Sevastopol today the winds were about four miles an hour with 40 degree [4C] temperatures and a little bit of rain,” the former commanding general of the US army in Europe told CNN. What’s the significance? The sinking of the Moskva – the pride of its fleet and the most prestigious vessel involved in the war against Ukraine – represents a symbolic blow to the Kremlin. What could this mean for Russian strategy? The CIA director, William Burns, warned of “desperation” from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, who could resort to using a tactical or low-yield nuclear weapon in light of his country’s military setbacks. Moscow has said it will be forced to strengthen its defences in the Baltic if Finland and Sweden join Nato, including by deploying nuclear weapons. Finland and Sweden are deliberating over whether to abandon decades of military non-alignment to join Nato, with the two Nordic countries’ leaders saying Russia’s onslaught on Ukraine has changed Europe’s “whole security landscape”. Lithuania played down the threat, saying Russia already has nuclear weapons in its Baltic Kaliningrad enclave. That claim has not been independently verified. What to expect next as the war enters its seventh week? Ukraine is braced for a powerful attack in the east. What sanctions is Volodymyr Zelenskiy calling for? The Ukrainian president this week has been urging the west for greater sanctions such as to stop buying all Russian oil. He also wants diplomats to return to Kyiv. A member of an Islamic state group that beheaded American hostages in Iraq and Syria, nicknamed the Beatles for their British accents, has been found guilty in a US court of terrorism offences. A jury found El Shafee Elsheikh, a 33-year-old former British citizen, guilty on all eight counts after a trial in Alexandria, Virginia. The jury deliberated for four hours before reaching its verdict in the most significant prosecution of an Islamic State member in the US. Elsheikh stood motionless and gave no visible reaction as the verdict was read. He faces up to a life sentence in prison. What was he charged with? Elsheikh was charged with hostage-taking, conspiracy to murder US citizens – journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid workers Peter Kassig and Kayla Mueller – and supporting a terrorist organisation. Did the survivors identify him? No. Although the Beatles had distinctive accents – survivors identified them as John, George and Ringo – they always took great care to hide their faces. Prosecutors suggested Elsheikh was Ringo but only had to prove he was one of the Beatles. Boris Johnson’s plans to send unauthorised asylum seekers on a one-way ticket to Rwanda has been decried by opponents. The UK government plan was attacked as inhumane, expensive and deadly with senior Conservatives also criticizing Johnson. The defamation case between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard thundered on, with the couple’s marriage counselor, Dr Laurel Anderson, describing their relationship as slipping into “mutual abuse”. An archaeological dig under Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris has uncovered an extraordinary treasure of statues, sculptures, tombs and pieces of an original rood screen dating to the 13th century. Covid cases are rising in the north-east US as many Americans travel for spring break and religious holidays. The increase is being driven by the more transmissible Omicron variant, BA.2. A Mexican woman died in a “senseless tragedy” after attempting to climb the US border wall in eastern Arizona. The sheriff’s office said her foot and leg became entangled as she tried to maneuver down. She was 32. An Ohio man who claimed he was only “following presidential orders” from Donald Trump when he stormed the US Capitol has been convicted by a jury. It took jurors less than three hours to reject the defence of Dustin Byron Thompson, 38. Sina Estavi, the crypto entrepreneur who paid $2.9m for an NFT in March last year featuring the Twitter boss Jack Dorsey’s first tweet, looks likely to lose almost everything on the asset. By Thursday Estavi had received a top bid of just $6,800 for the non-fungible token; he was hoping for $48m. But the owner’s confidence in his NFT was not shaken. “This is the Mona Lisa of the digital world,” he told Reuters, adding he might not sell it. Since the Covid pandemic began, millions of workers around the world have gone remote. Now bosses are offering special sweeteners to anyone willing to trudge back. Everything from virtual golf, free tacos, “pet stipends” and more. Google is giving US employees money for electric scooter subscriptions. Goldman Sachs is blasting live music outside offices. But in a tight labor market, whether the tactics are successful remains to be seen. Canada was warned in 2012 by its scientists that a virus was infecting farmed and wild salmon. But successive governments ignored the expert advice, saying for years that risks to salmon were low. The 2012 report was finally released in March this year after a multiyear access-to-information battle. The industrial salmon industry was accused of relying on the government to “hide their sins”. When I was living in Chile on a gap year aged 18, says Matthew Brown, we went hiking in the Cajón del Maipo, a wildlife-rich canyon in the mountains to the south of Santiago. The narrow path fell perilously away, not quite sheer but steep and hard. I remember noticing some rocks at the edge of the drop shift slightly. As I was processing this, the ground beneath my hiking boots gave way. ‘This is it,’ I thought as I started to roll down the canyon, rapidly picking up speed.

4/15/2022,"Campaigning in Burgundy the day after reaching the second round of France’s presidential elections, Marine Le Pen could not have seemed clearer: “I do not want to leave the EU,” she said. “That is not my objective.” Much of what the far-right Rassemblement National (National Rally) leader does want to do, however – on the economy, social policy and immigration – implies breaking the rules of the 27-member bloc, and her possible arrival in the Élysée Palace next weekend could prove calamitous for the bloc. Le Pen may have dropped previous pledges to take France – a founder member of the EU, its second-biggest economy and half of the vital Franco-German engine that has powered it since its creation – out of the euro single currency and the bloc. In the 2017 election, fears of the economic consequences of that policy, above all among older voters worried about their savings, are widely seen as having contributed to her heavy second-round defeat against the pro-European Emmanuel Macron. This time, the EU does not even feature by name among the dozen or so key themes of Le Pen’s electoral programme. Many of her concrete policy proposals, however, blatantly contradict the obligations of EU membership. Opponents and commentators have called the strategy “Frexit in all but name”: an approach that, while it may no longer aim to remove France from the bloc, seeks to fundamentally refashion it, and that could lead to a paralysing standoff with Brussels. “Le Pen’s EU policy is: ‘We’re going to stay in the bus but drive it off a cliff,’” said Mujtaba Rahman, the Europe director of Eurasia Group consultancy. It would “try to destroy EU from the inside” and was “a much greater threat to the EU status quo than Brexit”, he said. Pascal Lamy, who was chief of staff to the former European Commission president Jacques Delors, said a Le Pen victory would be a major shock on a bigger scale “than Trump was for the United States, or Brexit for the UK”. Her “sovereigntist, protectionist, nationalist” agenda would “totally contradict the French commitment to European integration” and includes “proposals which are in total breach of the treaties to which France has subscribed,” he said. Key to Le Pen’s plans is an early referendum on a proposed law on “citizenship, identity and immigration” that would modify the constitution to allow a “national priority” for French citizens in employment, social security benefits and public housing – a measure incompatible with EU values and free movement rules. The same referendum would establish “the primacy of national law over European law” to allow France “not only to control immigration but, in every other area, reconcile its European engagement with the preservation of its national sovereignty and the defence of its interests”, the her RN party says. The aim would be to enable France to benefit from a “Europe à la carte”, picking and choosing from the bits of EU legislation it likes and dislikes – a non-starter for the bloc that was forcefully ruled out by the 27 during Brexit negotiations with the UK. “It’s absurd,” said Jean-Louis Bourlanges, a centrist MP and president of the French parliament’s foreign affairs committee. “As soon as you affirm the primacy of national law, you have no European law. Marine Le Pen has rejected an official exit, but her programme is not compatible with continued French membership of the EU.” Le Pen also aims to re-establish border controls on imports and people, violating EU and Schengen rules, and unilaterally cut France’s contribution to the EU budget – when the bloc’s multi-annual financial framework for 2021 to 2027 is already fixed. Further plans to cut taxes on essential goods and fuel would breach EU free market rules. Big questions may remain about how much of this programme could be implemented, domestically and in an EU context. Le Pen’s ambitions would be thwarted if she failed to win a parliamentary majority in elections in June, and EU legal experts have pointed out that even so much as holding a referendum on the primacy of national law would be in breach of European treaties. French lawyers also say the country’s highest court, the constitutional council, would throw out Le Pen’s plan for a referendum by presidential decree – avoiding the need for parliamentary approval – precisely because any referendum intended to modify the constitution must have the backing of MPs and senators. The EU as it exists today, Le Pen said earlier this year, was “neglectful of peoples, and domineering of nations”, an “intrusive and authoritarian” bloc locked into “a globalist, open-border ideology” that was “destroying our identity”. Her vision, she said, was of an “alliance of nations … respectful of peoples, histories and national sovereignties”, whose members could “favour their own businesses for public contracts” and “re-establish permanent checks” on their borders. But even if she failed to declare the primacy of French law and establish a national preference, the small print in Le Pen’s programme seems certain to lead France inexorably down the road towards a conflictual relationship with the EU – with political chaos the consequence given France’s indispensable role within the bloc. “She could totally put [the EU] into gridlock or paralyse it,” said Georg Riekeles, a former European Commission official, who forecast “a dramatic weakening” of the EU’s ability to deal with crises, from security to the climate. Le Pen has vowed to pull France out of Nato’s integrated command structure, removing troops and weapons from common management. She also wants to dismantle French windfarms, a strike against France’s EU renewable energy targets. “Any topic will just be more complicated,” Riekeles said. EU insiders worry that a France led by Le Pen would also provide a major boost to national-conservative governments in countries such as Poland and Hungary, potentially allying with capitals that have long challenged the supremacy of EU law and are locked in battle with Brussels. “It would stop every attempt to change things in Poland and Hungary,” said the French MEP Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield, who works on the rule of law. While the Green MEP believes the EU’s institutions and single market would continue under a Le Pen presidency, she thinks it “would be the end of a rule of law, values-based European Union”. For the EU, a President Le Pen could mean a five-year “empty chair” crisis, Lamy suggested, referring to the events of 1965 when the then French president, Charles de Gaulle, boycotted the European institutions in a row over the budget. “For certain, it would be a big problem, short term, during the next five years,” he said. “I have a hard time believing that if she was elected with the programme that she has, she would be re-elected.”",News/World news,‘Frexit in all but name’: what a Marine Le Pen win would mean for EU,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/15/frexit-what-marine-le-pen-win-mean-eu
4/15/2022,"This soulful, heavy hearted drama tells a tale of gentrification and community displacement in Cambodia. It’s a fictional story about the real-life White Building, an iconic modernist apartment block built in 1963 in the centre of Phnom Penh and demolished in 2017. The film’s director, Kavich Neang, has a personal connection: he grew up in the White Building and opens his film with an extraordinary drone shot that floats above the building’s roof. From this angle the mosaic of chipped tiles and rusted corrugated sheets looks strangely beautiful: a metaphor perhaps for the White Building itself, which is crumbling and not fit for habitation, but still home to a vibrant diverse community, everyone happily jostling in the corridors. Neang’s story is about a boy’s coming of age as his family is evicted. Piseth Chhun gives a sensitive performance as Nang, who at the start of the movie, bleached streaks in his hair, dreams of boyband-style fame with his hip-hop dance squad, which is basically him and two mates. He lives with his mum and sculptor dad in the building, whose residents are being pushed out so property developers can move in. The miserably low payoff will force most of them out of the city, where house prices are skyrocketing. The film follows Nang as he matures from boy to man. His dad is spokesman for the tenants’ association, and there are bad-tempered meetings about whether to accept the eviction deal. Then the building’s water supply is switched off. Worryingly, Nang’s dad has an infected big toe, which appears to be gangrenous, a complication of diabetes; the blackening spreads like the mould on the apartment’s ceiling. This is a gentle-going watch, understated – underpowered even – and sometimes a little drowsy. Still, it has real sensitivity and insight into the transition to adulthood, as gradually it dawns on Nang that his parents don’t have all the answers. White Building is available on Mubi from Wednesday.",Arts/Film,White Building review – soulful Cambodia drama captures a real-life apartment block,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/11/white-building-review-soulful-drama-captures-coming-of-age-and-eviction-in-cambodia

4/15/2022,"When Tan France released his autobiography in 2019, it wasn’t the accounts of the constant racism he experienced growing up in Doncaster in the 1980s that caught the media’s attention, nor was it his glitzy tales of recent fame as one of the stars of the Netflix makeover show Queer Eye. Instead, what hit the headlines was the confession that he used skin-bleaching cream as a nine-year-old that hit. “Back in the UK, if I went a week without being called a P-word on the street, that was really something,” France says over a video call from his current home in Salt Lake City, Utah. “When I was five I was chased and beaten up by a group of white men on my way to school. But it was this one account of me trying to lighten my skin as a child that the press made an unexpectedly huge deal of. “I was just a child and I felt so much pressure to be lighter,” he says. “The shame about my skin I experienced outside the house followed me home, and so I put on the cream.” It is an uncomfortable revelation from someone best known for his relentless optimism and perfectly coiffed aesthetic. It is a new, introspective side of France, one that forms a key part of his revealing new BBC Two documentary on colourism. Defined as a form of discrimination based on the shade of a person of colour’s skin tone – rather than just their skin colour – colourism has in recent years become a high-profile topic of discussion. In 2021, the Little Mix singer Leigh-Anne Pinnock fronted a BBC Three documentary that addressed the issue within the music industry. The Guardian launched its own series of first-hand accounts in 2019; while 2018 research from Vanderbilt University found that US immigrants with a darker skin tone were paid as much as 25% less than their lighter-skinned counterparts. “Colourism is everywhere and it’s not the same as racism,” France says. “It’s often within communities of colour themselves that people are discriminated against based on the darkness of their skin, and it has lifelong effects of internalised shame.” During his film, France recounts how family members would jokingly refer to darker relatives as “Coco Pops”, or would say that only lighter-skinned youngsters would end up getting married. These comments, coupled with an entertainment landscape that only ever placed lighter-skinned people of colour on screen, are what France believes have contributed to his ongoing struggles with colourism. He says in the documentary that he still feels uncomfortable coming back to the UK when he’s not in London; there is a scene where he tries to revisit Doncaster to confront his past, but he can’t bring himself to actually go. “When we announced this documentary, people were asking: ‘Why is light-skinned Tan France the one hosting it?’ But I want them to understand that every person of colour – no matter what shade you are – experiences this discrimination in some form,” France says. “I was always conditioned to think that white is right and lighter is better through the prevalence of the light-skinned imagery I grew up seeing.” It has had such an effect that when he returned from a recent holiday in Hawaii, he was surprised by the amount he had tanned. “I saw myself in my bathroom mirror and I immediately thought: ‘Oh gosh, I got a bit too brown,’” he says, then pauses. “For a second, I allowed myself to believe that was a problem again.” France has built a thriving TV career over the past four years, primarily on the back of the heartfelt encouragement he offers along with his fashion expertise. Yet he is affectingly honest in admitting the lack of self-acceptance he still has towards his own skin tone. In the film, he recounts for the first time how he used skin-bleaching cream again when he was 16. “It wasn’t until we started filming and we spoke to adults who still felt this pressure that I realised I had to admit to doing it again at 16 … I would be a hypocrite if I didn’t, but I still carry shame about it because I was old enough to understand better.” Rather than stop after a first attempt – as he did at nine when he pilfered a bottle from his cousin – France bought the cream and used it multiple times. “We shot over 100 hours of interviews and I went to see a psychotherapist twice, but there was no ‘A-ha!’ moment,” he says. “We could have kept on filming for three years but I still don’t think I would rid myself of the guilt for bleaching again. I don’t want to fake it, or for people to think that you can get over these huge cultural and societal pressures just because you’ve done some self-exploration.” Rather than trying to exorcise the guilt entirely, he says he compartmentalised it. “It’s one of my greatest skills in life, where the things that troubled me, I can push aside and focus on the things that I can really build on.” Skin bleaching is a pervasive phenomenon and one that is part of a growing worldwide industry. Global sales of skin lightening cream are expected to reach $11.8bn by 2026, up from $8bn in 2020, with the Asia-Pacific region accounting for the most revenue. Clearly, colourism is a discrimination that has yet to go away. “We interviewed high-school kids and I was shocked and saddened to hear them saying the same things I was hearing 30 years ago,” France says. “It’s like nothing has changed.” Perhaps the biggest revelation in the film comes from France realising that he is now the same age as the elders who would make disparaging comments about skin tone when he was younger. “People of my generation are the aunties and uncles now, so how the fuck did we not learn?” he says, incredulously. “We’re still saying the same things to our kids, and that makes me far less hopeful that colourism will be eradicated in my lifetime.” It was, in fact, the birth of his first child in July 2021 that made France want to readdress the traumatic incidents of his past. “Lots of people are rightfully concerned about having kids in the midst of the climate crisis, but what scared me most about being a dad was my son feeling the same things that scared me,” he says. France says he plans to homeschool his children, in part, to allow him greater control over the people and ideas his son encounters growing up. “As a parent, it’s made me determined to make sure he understands that the colour of his skin will not hinder him at all … It was thinking about how difficult his life might be because of his skin colour. That’s when I knew this documentary had to happen.” Now that he has excavated his childhood trauma for the world to see, is he worried about how it might be received? “It would be really naive of me to think that a documentary is enough to change something we’ve been conditioned to feel our entire lives, but I want communities of colour to understand what they are doing to the younger generation,” France says. “I want the aunties and uncles to realise that they can be just as damaging as those white men who beat up five-year-old Tan. And perhaps even more so, since I find colourism harder to deal with now than I do racism.” For white audiences, France hopes the film will have a positive impact on the entertainment industry, too. “The UK does a really bad job of representing marginalised groups, so I want the white people watching to understand the importance of having different skin tones on screen,” he says, gesturing with renewed determination. “I know that I speak with an English accent and I know I’m lighter than many south Asians, but having me on Queer Eye is radical. It’s sad that four years on, I’m still one of the very, very few people of colour authentically represented on screen.” Now that he holds this power of representation, if he could go back and speak to nine-year-old Tan again, that little boy who was so shamed into trying to change the colour of his skin, what would he say? “I would want him to feel like his experiences of the world won’t always have to be hindered by the colour of his skin …” He pauses. “That there are many differences between us, but we should all be treated equally and we are all capable of being loved.” Tan France: Beauty & the Bleach airs at 9pm on 27 April, BBC Two.",Arts/Television & radio,Tan France: ‘I was conditioned to think light skin was better’,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/15/tan-france-bbc-three-colourism-documentary
4/15/2022,"Weronika Klemba had just dropped off a group of fellow volunteers at the forest near the border between Poland and Belarus when she was pulled over by police. The 21-year-old student did not want to reveal she was there to offer help to some of the hundreds of people who have been living in the woods, because “I didn’t want them to get the information of where the refugees are,” she says. “I knew they were in a bad condition, and I didn’t want them to get pushed back to Belarus.” Klemba, a volunteer with the Club of Catholic Intelligentsia at its aid point near the border, says she was then arrested and told she was a “suspicious person”. The first thing her parents knew of her arrest was when police entered their flat in Warsaw the next morning to search for Klemba’s computer. Klemba was held at the police station for 48 hours before she was released and charged with organising an illegal border crossing. Last year, the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, started to organise the movement of asylum seekers from the Middle East to the Polish border. As a result, thousands of people have attempted to cross into Poland, and have met an increasingly hostile and sometimes violent response. Many end up seeking refuge in nearby forests and setting up camp there. Just last month Klemba raised more than 60,000 zloty (£10,700) to help Ukrainian refugees fleeing war. But now she is facing eight years in prison for her efforts to help different refugees at the Belarusian border. “People were super proud of me saying congratulations, then when I’m going to the other border it’s like I’m a criminal in the eyes of the people who have power.” Klemba makes no such distinction: “Everyone should get help if they are in a bad situation no matter their nationality. I think it’s obvious.” As Poland has welcomed about 2.5 million refugees from Ukraine since the Russian invasion, there remains a 3km exclusion zone on its border with Belarus that aid workers are forbidden to enter. Polish authorities say that the Belarusian government is organising a “hybrid operation”, sending “illegal immigrants” to the Polish border who are being pushed back. A new wall spanning almost half the length of the Belarusian border is being built and volunteers on the ground, many of whom have also been helping at the Ukrainian border, say their work is becoming increasingly criminalised at the Belarusian frontier. Volunteers say the authorities are taking a harsher line and people who previously may have received a small fine for helping refugees are now facing criminal charges. Klemba is one of a growing number charged with “organising an illegal border crossing”. On 22 March, four people were held for three days and charged after being arrested for trying to provide aid to a family with young children in the forest. It is for this reason that Anna*, 44, and her 14-year-old daughter Maria*, do not want their faces or location shared. They live in a scenic birch forest near the border, and scores of refugees have found sanctuary in their home in recent months. Anna says she knows that letting exhausted refugees stay under her roof carries an increased risk: “I still think I’m doing nothing wrong but I’m aware that I can be put in jail.” The situation has become increasingly hostile she says. “Now they are putting criminal charges, earlier it was civil charges, it’s changed a lot. I think the situation is more dramatic and complicated because we are doing exactly the same thing they are doing on the Ukrainian border, but they are treating us as smugglers or criminals.” Many of the people helping refugees conceal their faces or names because of an increase in criminalisation of what they’re doing. Outside the courthouse in Bialystok, one of the biggest cities near the Belarusian border and often the centre of these criminal proceedings, activists hold signs in support of a volunteer, Mila, who is one of the four people accused of organising an illegal border crossing. On Thursday evening in central Warsaw, a couple of hundred people, including families with young children, gathered to protest the increasing criminalisation of aid at the Belarusian border. People carried signs in support of refugees at the border and one man, who only wanted to be identified by his first name, Teodor, carried a flag with a WhatsApp location pin on it, to symbolise the location pins desperate asylum seekers send to volunteers when they have crossed over and are stuck in the woods and need help. Some of those recently arrested, including Klemba, spoke about their experiences at the border. “I will not be intimidated,” Klemba told the crowd, “our help is needed.” Aleksandra Chrzanowska from the Association for Legal Intervention and one of those in attendance said it was important people had come out to protest. “A lot of ordinary people helping at the Ukrainian border are treated as heroes but at the Belarusian border if you want to help there you are treated as a criminal, that is why we are here today, because people are accused of smuggling whilst saving lives.” In a nearby cafe local resident Mariusz Kurnyta, 45, remains undeterred. Kurnyta has also come from court, where he appeared for refusing to pay a fine for being in the exclusion zone where he had gone to help a family with a newborn baby. “The zone is illegal,” he says. “The fines are harassment of activists – you need to help anyone regardless of the colour of their skin or nationality.” Kurnyta insists he will not pay even though refusing will mean a heavier penalty. Marta Górczyńska, a lawyer from the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights who has been working at the Ukrainian and Belarusian borders in recent weeks, says the distinction between the two frontiers is clear. “The main difference is that we can work very openly at the Ukrainian border, while at the Belarusian border, we have to be very careful about revealing our presence since we’re not welcomed; and we are criminalised for what we’re doing.” * Names have been changed Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",News/Global development,Smugglers or saviours?

4/15/2022,"Burnley have sacked Sean Dyche as manager with the club battling to stay in the Premier League. Dyche, who took the job in October 2012, leaves with his team third from bottom, four points adrift of 17th-placed Everton. “Results this season have been disappointing and, while this was an incredibly difficult decision, with eight crucial games of the campaign remaining, we feel a change is needed to give the squad the best possible chance of retaining its Premier League status,” said the chairman, Alan Pace. “The process of replacing Sean has begun and further announcements will be made to supporters in due course.” Burnley said Sunday’s game at West Ham would be overseen by the under-23s coach Mike Jackson with assistance from the academy director Paul Jenkins, the under-23s goalkeeping coach Connor King and the captain Ben Mee. Burnley have lost five of their past six matches, winning the other at Everton, and last weekend’s defeat at bottom-placed Norwich has prompted the board to make the change. Dyche has twice got the club promoted from the Championship, achieved two top-half Premier League finishes and under him Burnley qualified for Europe for the first time in 51 years. He was the Premier League’s longest-serving manager – a mantle that passes to Jürgen Klopp, who took charge of Liverpool in October 2015. “We would like to place on record our sincere thanks to Sean and his staff for their achievements at the club over the last decade,” Pace said. “During his time at Turf Moor, Sean has been a credit both on and off the pitch, respected by players, staff, supporters, and the wider football community.” Dyche’s assistants Ian Woan, Steve Stone and Billy Mercer have also departed with the club having secured only four league wins this season. The club came under new ownership in December 2020, when ALK Capital took an 84% stake. Burnley sold their striker Chris Wood in January when Newcastle triggered his £25m release clause and the purchase of Wout Weghorst for £12m as a replacement has not worked as anticipated, the Netherlands international scoring one goal.",Sport/Football,Burnley sack Sean Dyche in midst of Premier League relegation battle,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/15/burnley-sack-sean-dyche-in-midst-of-premier-league-relegation-battle
