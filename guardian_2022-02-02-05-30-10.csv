2/2/2022,"Barnet players claim they were threatened with the sack for saying they would strike after a member of staff made an alleged racist comment at an opponent. The club’s National League match at home to Stockport on Saturday was paused and an announcement made to the crowd after an allegation against Barnet’s first-team logistics manager, Ricky Bartlett.  The club say police concluded on the day that there was “no allegation or substance for a criminal investigation to take place”. The players asked Bartlett to stay away from training on Monday and when he turned up he was confronted by the captain, Jamie Turley. The Guardian has been told that the squad then had long discussions about not playing Tuesday’s match at Southend and that this resulted in a threat to sack anyone who refused to take part. The match has gone ahead as scheduled. Messages between the players and the chairman, Tony Kleanthous, were relayed on Monday and Tuesday by the head of football, Dean Brennan, who is also the acting manager. Kleanthous said Turley and Bartlett had been suspended on full pay pending an investigation. “A suspension is not in and of itself a disciplinary action or a reflection of guilt,” he said. Kleanthous, asked whether the players had been threatened with the sack if they did not play against Southend, said: “I have not spoken with them [and] am not aware of any direct ‘sacking’ threat to the players. However, it is worth noting that the players are contracted under the standard FA playing contracts to participate in football matches, so I would assume that any threats not to play would be a breach of their contracts and would carry heavy sanctions from the National League.” Kleanthous said an investigation into the alleged comment by Bartlett had been carried out on Saturday, conducted by the safety officer in consultation with the police. “The senior police officer at the scene confirms there was no allegation or substance for a criminal investigation to take place,” Kleanthous said. He said the club were conducting further investigations “to ensure a comprehensive review of the matter” and that the observations would be sent to the Football Association. “The club will not tolerate racism or any other form of abuse and will act swiftly and robustly to deal with any such behaviour,” he said. The Guardian has approached Bartlett for comment via the club.",Sport/Football,Barnet players say they were threatened with sack in row over alleged racism,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/01/barnet-players-say-they-were-threatened-with-sack-in-row-over-alleged-racism
2/2/2022,"Case by case, the idea that the police’s problems with women is the result of a few bad apples rather than a misogynistic culture gets harder to maintain. The revelations about the hate-filled messages among officers sent via WhatsApp and Facebook at Charing Cross station in central London are exceptionally sickening in their nature.  The culture of the past that was supposed to be banished has now moved into the digital and social media sphere. New technologies, old problems. But even inside the Metropolitan police, some believe it is a wider problem. “People have to look at the tree,” one Met insider told the Guardian. “You have to look at the leadership.” In the report from the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) about Charing Cross, there are two sections that will alarm policymakers who say they want change, such as police leaders and the home secretary. The police watchdog noted the offensive messages and bullying was rooted in culture: “We believe these incidents are not isolated or simply the behaviour of a few ‘bad apples’.” Police leaders say they encourage whistleblowing, but the IOPC concluded officers did not believe their speaking up would be taken seriously, nor would they be protected from reprisals: “It is recognised that reporting a colleague comes with significant personal risk and knowledge of colleagues’ poor experiences who have done the same can prevent other victims from coming forward and embolden perpetrators to continue their behaviour.” There was one small glimmer of hope: when the IOPC and Met leadership directly appealed to officers at Charing Cross to come forward and report wrongdoing, several did. Given the confidence, the majority of officers were prepared to take a stand against those who were capable of displaying such hatred and venom to the public they serve. The exposure of the Charing Cross hate messages was discovered when the IOPC was investigating another allegation. Recent cases show problems in other forces. In January 2022 alone, a former officer in Northumbria was jailed for inappropriate contact with a woman; a Greater Manchester officer was found guilty of misconduct in public office over a relationship with a vulnerable female victim of crime; a former officer in North Yorkshire was found to have abused his position for a sexual purpose; an officer in Surrey was found to have had an inappropriate relationship with a woman; and a Thames Valley officer was charged and appeared in court over alleged inappropriate relationships with women. The renewed focus on women and policing was triggered after a serving Met officer, Wayne Couzens, kidnapped, raped and murdered Sarah Everard in March 2021. Women’s groups saw it not as an aberration, but the most clear cut example of attitudes polluting policing and the service women get. The IOPC is examining two forces, Kent and the Met, over whether they missed chances to identify Couzens as a potential threat to women before he attacked Everard. The investigations involve claims he indecently exposed himself and that police failed to track him down despite chances to do so. In Kent’s case it was six years before the attack; in the Met’s case, just days before. For police leaders trying to rebuild trust, the worst may be yet to come.",News/Society,Revealing the rot: police misogyny runs deeper still,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/01/revealing-the-rot-police-misogyny-runs-deeper-still
2/2/2022,"Good morning. Tensions with Russia continue to increase as Vladimir Putin has spoken out about the crisis with Ukraine for the first time this year. In Australia, the reopening of international borders has seen demand for passports soar. And scientists are working out if human urine could be “liquid gold” for parks. Fossil fuel companies gave nearly $1m in political donations to the three major parties last financial year, according to analysis from campaign group 350.org. The lion’s share of the $959,115 donated by eight oil and gas companies or their lobby groups went to the Liberal party, followed by Labor and then the Nationals. Shani Tager, the senior campaign manager at 350, called for political donations from the oil and gas sector to be banned over the risk it may influence policymaking in a way that stops action on climate change. The Australian Electoral Commission has also released its transparency register for the 2020-21 financial year. Anthony Pratt’s Pratt Holdings was the biggest political donor in the last year.  Scott Morrison has been blindsided by a claim that leaked texts between a party colleague and Gladys Berejiklian included her calling the prime minister a “horrible person” who was untrustworthy. Morrison on Tuesday was confronted at the National Press Club by the Network Ten political editor, Peter van Onselen, who claimed he had been leaked text messages between “a current Liberal cabinet minister” and Berejiklian. The former NSW premier said she had “no recollection of such messages”. Vladimir Putin has accused the US of ignoring Russia’s security proposals in his first public comments on the growing crisis over Ukraine since December. Putin told journalists he was unsatisfied with the US response to Russian demands that Nato remove troops and infrastructure from eastern Europe and pledge never to accept Ukraine into the alliance. A phone call between Boris Johnson and Putin that Johnson was forced to cancel on Monday has been rescheduled for Wednesday. Johnson has dismissed claims that the UK and US are exaggerating the threat posed by Russia, saying there is “a clear and present danger”. Queensland authorities told disability homes to manage Covid cases alone when they asked for help, it has been revealed in emails obtained by Guardian Australia. The authorities abandoned their own contingency plans to protect vulnerable disability housing residents in the event of a Covid outbreak, instead telling accommodation providers to manage positive cases themselves and just “do what you reasonably can”. It is now clear that you can catch Covid more than once but also that an infection boosts your protection from reinfection. So what actually happens after you get the virus? We asked the experts. Australians are waiting 60% longer than usual for their passports as demand soars after the reopening of international borders. The government has issued more than 275,000 passports since 1 November, almost triple the number compared with a year ago. A new trial is examining if human urine could be “liquid gold” for horticulturists and used as a cheap and sustainable source of fertiliser in Australia’s city parks. Researchers say tackling the picnicking public’s instinctive “yuck factor” towards “urine diversion toilets” will be part of their work. NSW is promising to build more than 1,000 charging stations for electric vehicles under a four-year plan that would create the country’s most extensive EV network. Downing Street has U-turned on its refusal to confirm whether it would reveal if Boris Johnson had been fined for breaching Covid rules, acknowledging there would be “significant public interest” in the issue. But it still remains unclear if No 10 will comment on whether any staff were fined for lockdown-breaking parties. A whistleblower has alleged that an executive at NSO Group offered a US-based mobile security company “bags of cash” for access to a global signalling network used to track individuals through their mobile phones, according to a complaint to the US Department of Justice. Donald Trump directed Rudy Giuliani to ask the Department of Homeland Security if it could seize voting machines in three key states, the New York Times reported, but DHS officials told Giuliani it did not have the authority to do so. The fights are explosive, the relationships can be toxic but Married at First Sight has the country hooked. So, how did such a divisive show take over? MAFS hasn’t always been messy. Season five was the point when MAFS changed from being a show that “genuinely explored the psychological growth and love between two people” into “the absolute unrepentant garbage fire that we know and love-hate it as today”, as the writer Clementine Ford describes it. To create his new show for the Melbourne international comedy festival, Damian Callinan raided his parents’ diaries. As well as being great material, his mum’s diaries are unsurprisingly a cherished sentimental object for Callinan. He tells us why he’d rush to save those pages in a fire, as well as the story of two other important personal belongings. Autism comprises an exponentially wide range of presentations but the discourse surrounding it doesn’t, writes Al Campbell: “Few people at the hard-end of the disability spectrum will become authors. Similarly, non-verbal, profoundly autistic people like [my son] Rupert cannot be actors; plainly, this is not a realistic expectation. So when a narrative simply cannot be told by an #ActuallyAutistic person, what then? We don’t tell it, at all? That doesn’t seem right to me.” After 44 years of waiting, an Australian has won at the Australian Open after 25-year-old Ash Barty secured the singles title. But Barty wasn’t the only Australian getting attention. Thanasi Kokkinakis and Nick Kyrgios and their enthusiastic fans divided the tennis community.

2/2/2022,"“Somehow it seemed as though the farm had grown richer without making the animals themselves any richer.” So apparently it’s all fine now. European football’s winter window has closed. Premier League spending levels have returned to the upward curve of endless growth. The football locomotive powered entirely by self-replenishing gravy continues to rattle along the tracks at harum-scarum speed, still belching out fat hot greasy plumes of smoke and disgorging its load in the old familiar stops.  And like George Orwell’s farm, with its strict rules on exactly who gets the apples and the milk, an industry that always grows richer without ever feeling richer is happy to promote the idea that chaotic expense is evidence of life, vigour and stable future prospects. Certainly this is the in-house view. “The Premier League continues to lead the way globally, retaining its status as the world’s biggest domestic football league,” read a statement by the league’s accountants Deloitte. And they are undoubtedly correct. But leading us where exactly? There are two notable things about the last month’s business. First, around half of the league’s total £300m outlay was spent by the bottom five clubs in the Premier League, money disbursed out of fear rather than hope, at a time when falling out of the top tier can have disastrous consequence. And second the headline deals have tended to involve football’s version of toxic human assets, transfers driven by the urge to save money as much as spend it. This is a new breed of elite player: out there circling the globe like radioactive waste ships, passed from port to port, turned toxic by their own contracts of employment. Philippe Coutinho moved early, with Aston Villa agreeing to pay over half of a reduced version of his vertiginous salary. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s Arsenal pension plan has been offloaded to Barcelona in return for some zingy tweets, an unveiling and some distracting goals over the next few months. Dele Alli has left Spurs in return for a staged payment down the line, another talented, ailing footballer reduced to a kind of human debt bond to be passed from ledger to ledger. As the Premier League gong has continued to clang the talk has been of a market pumped and jazzed and throbbing. Never mind that eight months ago Europe’s elite clubs were engaged in a violently ham-fisted attempt to tear down the existing structures simply to protect their own insane financial model. The wheels are rolling again. We’re back baby: we’re back. Does this really feel like a healthy way to go? Take for example the fascinating tale of Aaron Ramsey, perhaps the most successfully monetised club career in elite football history. Initial reports had Ramsey on £400,000 a week at Juventus. Numbers from inside the club have suggested the actual basic wage is considerably less (close your eyes and choose a number: Juve are under investigation over alleged massaging of player values). Ramsey is not to blame for any of this. He didn’t create this absurd scenario. He is a supremely talented footballer. But however you slice it here is a player who has won one major trophy, who has only ever been a part of disappointing club teams, who continues to be rewarded for this beyond any sensible human scale. And who is, by some insane chain of logic, being paid almost twice as much as Aberdeen’s annual wage bill – subsidised by Juventus – to help Rangers win the Scottish league. There is a direct line to be drawn here. Juventus were one of the instigators of the Super League breakaway, a club so indebted the only reasonable course was to tear apart European football’s basic sporting integrity. If you were outraged by that, if you went into the streets to protest against the theft of the people’s game, then it should be hard to see shoots of hope in a transfer window splurge that is essentially more fuel, more travel down the same path. And perhaps it is also time to question the unsustainable nature of players’ salaries. This is not a fashionable view. There is a tendency to over-venerate footballers. Talent, wealth and celebrity are persuasive things. The standard line is we should not begrudge players their vast fortunes, that it is a short and unstable career, that we must remain subservient to the sanctity of the market. But the market here is not a noble, smooth, high-functioning thing, a paean to pure human talent. Football’s market is distorted by greed, corruption and the whims of nation-state PR machines. For every superheated transfer there will be a corresponding mini-industry of leaks and dividends for those who profit personally from keeping the market in that state. How are football’s future market prospects serviced by the Glazer family removing millions in personal payments while clubs lower down the levels are menaced with collapse, participation and grassroots left to wither, the base of this elite-tier product neglected? This is not money sourced from some magical gushing tap. Every penny comes from the pockets of supporters, people who buy tickets and TV subs, and who, like the players, also have their own short, perilous careers to support, alongside a relentlessly flogged attachment to their own wastrel clubs. What to do about any of this? Resistance to the idea of an independent regulator has focused on the suggestion any restraints on constant outlay might “kill the golden goose”. Whereas of course English football is already doing this. The goose here is the wider game, which is in the process of being profitably strangled. There have been crowing comparisons in the last few days between the amounts spent at home and abroad. But what does this represent? A slackening of competition elsewhere. Decaying leagues. Managerial talent imported en masse from Germany (why make your own when you can buy it in?). Domestic setups from Europe to South America geared to serve the export market. The January window was fascinating in so many ways. Endless mouthwatering subplots have been grafted on. How angry or pleased will Antonio Conte be? How many of Newcastle’s portfolio of disconnected signings will stick to the wall? Can bespoke Ajax academy product Donny van de Beek rescue Frank Lampard’s relegation-threatened Everton, a genuinely strange combination of words straight from the new script ideas brainstorm folder? This is all great product. But let’s not pretend it has much to do with good health and financial good order.",Sport/Football,January window suggests football is back on path that led to Super League bid | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/01/january-window-suggests-football-is-back-on-path-that-led-to-super-league-bid
2/2/2022,"Covid vaccination rates show wide gaps in coverage between children of different ethnic backgrounds, social class and regions of England, according to figures published by the Office for National Statistics. While the national average shows that just 52.5% of children aged between 12 and 15 received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, rates among black children and those of Gypsy or Roma heritage are still far below the national average.  Shamez Ladhani, consultant paediatrician at the UK Health Security Agency and the study’s chief investigator, said: “With Covid-19 case rates currently high across school-age groups, it’s vital that we monitor and evaluate measures that help reduce transmission. We need families and students to continue to take part in the programme.” According to the ONS data, by mid-January 75% of children of Chinese heritage had received a vaccination, followed by nearly 66% of children of Indian heritage and 59% from white British backgrounds. But of those of Pakistani background just 34% had received a vaccination, followed by 27% of those of black African heritage, and only 12% of Gypsy, Roma and black Caribbean children. There were also substantial regional differences, with London having the lowest rates of vaccination for the 12-15 age group and the 16-17 age group, followed by the north-west of England. Raghib Ali, a senior clinical research associate at the University of Cambridge who has worked on Covid vaccine hesitancy for the government’s race disparity unit, said that the rates mirrored those of vaccine hesitancy among adults, and suggested that the high rates of natural infection experienced by children – especially in large cities such as London – may have led many families to think there was no need for a vaccination. Ali said parents needed to be assured that adding a vaccine on top of natural infection provided an even greater level of protection for their children. “The key thing is to provide parents and older children with information so that they can make informed choice, so they know what the benefit of the vaccine is likely to be. “It’s important that we are honest about that, that the vaccine doesn’t reduce transmission as much as we would like but it’s probably going to reduce the risk of long Covid and hospitalisation and death,” Ali said. “That’s one area where we, as doctors, healthcare workers and the government, should make sure that everyone has access to the facts and comprehensive information, and that would probably help to increase uptake.” Another reason for the low uptake could have been the recent rapid spread of Covid among schoolchildren, causing many to need to wait 28 days after infection before receiving a dose of the vaccine. A study published week found that more than 90% of children aged 12 to 15 had Covid antibodies. The ONS figures showed vaccination rates declined substantially according to areas of deprivation. While just over 70% of those from the wealthiest 10% had received a vaccine, the proportion fell by three to five percentage points for each decile. By the 10% in most deprived areas, just 36% had at least one jab. Just 36% of those aged 12-15 who received free school meals had been vaccinated, compared with 59% of those not receiving free school meals. Stephen Morgan, Labour’s shadow education minister, said ministers had failed to tackle the inequalities that were affecting children’s vaccination rates. “The government must redouble its efforts to drive up vaccination rates, including delivering targeted communications campaigns and school exclusion zones to prevent anti-vaxxers spreading dangerous disinformation,” Morgan said.",News/Society,Disparities in children’s Covid vaccination rates map England’s social divides ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/01/disparities-in-childrens-covid-vaccination-rates-map-englands-social-divides
