2/22/2022,"Novak Djokovic returned to competition for the first time since his deportation from Australia last month. He played at a high level as he defeated the wildcard Lorenzo Musetti 6-3, 6-3 and reached the second round of the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships on Monday. Eight weeks into the new tennis season, Djokovic’s victory marked his first match of the year and he was content with how he navigated the situation.  “All in all, it’s a straight-sets win so of course I have to be satisfied with my tennis,” Djokovic said. “Especially after not playing for almost three months. Of course there were moments when I played great, there were moments when I made a couple of unforced errors in a row, uncharacteristically, but it’s normal.” With the next tournaments on Djokovic’s calendar uncertain because he is unvaccinated, the crowd in Dubai made the most of the first sighting of the world No 1. Djoovic, who has won this title five times, entered the court to a loud ovation from an audience awash with Serbian flags, frequent chants of “Nole, Nole” and one spectator even carrying a flag with the hashtag “#WeStandWithNovakDjokovic” written across it. Although he continued to undertake daily fitness sessions upon his return from Australia, Djokovic did not train for 10 days as he dealt with his emotions from the events in Melbourne, only picking up a racket two and a half weeks ago. Despite some rustiness, Djokovic played a solid match, dictating his young Italian opponent from inside the baseline, serving well in the few tense moments and flipping spectacularly from defence to attack a number of times as a reminder of his supreme talent. This week marks one of the most significant moments of the year for Djokovic. After being unable to defend his Australian Open title, his No 1 ranking is seriously threatened by Daniil Medvedev. Should Medvedev, who is playing the Mexican Open in Acapulco, either equal or outperform Djokovic’s result this week the Russian will overtake him on Monday. For now, Djokovic was far more concerned with the simple sensation of victory. After his win, he saluted his audience, even addressing them in Serbian. “I couldn’t ask for a better reception ... it’s been a while since I played the last match so I couldn’t pick a better place to kick-start the season.” In the match before Djokovic’s, Andy Murray defeated the qualifier Christopher O’Connell 6-7(4), 6-3, 7-5 in a gruelling 2hr 51min contest to reach the second round in Dubai. It was an essential win after Murray endured one of the most one-sided defeats of his career last week in Doha, 6-0, 6-1 against Roberto Bautista Agut. Now firmly back inside the top 100, he will play for his 700th career win in the second round. Afterwards, Murray said he had not seen Djokovic yet in Dubai but they had spoken during his time in Australia. “We shared a few messages whilst he was in Australia,” he said. “Like I said at the time, I don’t agree with his decision. I think it would be a lot easier for him obviously if he was to get vaccinated. But I also didn’t like seeing him in the situation that he was in Australia as someone that I respect, have known since I was a child. I didn’t like seeing that.” Meanwhile, Cameron Norrie crossed 3,000 ranking points for the first time and returned to his career‑high ranking of No 12 after the British No 1 won his third career ATP title in Delray Beach late on Sunday night.",Sport/Sport,Novak Djokovic returns to action with solid win over Lorenzo Musetti in Dubai,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/21/novak-djokovic-returns-win-dubai-andy-murray
2/22/2022,"The video shows a ghostly scene. A night-time battle is taking place in a forest. There are flashes and mysterious bangs. An unidentified figure cries out in pain. The wounded man is wearing a helmet. Otherwise there are few clues as to where the footage was shot, or what exactly is going on. A TV report by Russia’s state-run channel one gave the answer. The man seen in eerie silhouette was a Ukrainian saboteur, it said. He was part of a diversionary team sent across enemy lines into pro-Russian separatist territory. His mission? To blow up a local chlorine plant in the rebel-held town of Horlivka, the channel said.  During the firefight two infiltrators were killed, it added. By happy coincidence, representatives of the Donetsk People’s Republic – one of two pro-Moscow entities in the east of Ukraine – retrieved the video from the wounded man’s head camera. He had chucked it away, channel one told its viewers. There was only one problem with the Kremlin’s dramatic account of the incident. It was entirely fake. The soundtrack of shooting and explosions was actually more than a decade old. It had been recorded in April 2010, according to open source researchers, during a Finnish military exercise. Ukraine’s intelligence service believes the video is the work of the GRU, Russia’s military spy agency, which has worked actively in Ukraine since the 2014 annexation of Crimea and the shooting down of the MH17 passenger plane. The film’s creators appear to have lifted the original Finnish video from the internet. They spliced its sound track on to new video content made two weeks ago – editing out a few excited “ooohs” from Finnish recruits. “Russia has a long record of doing this. It isn’t surprising,” Elliot Higgins, founder of the investigative website Bellingcat told the Guardian. He added: “What’s surprising is they haven’t got any better at doing it. In some ways they have got worse. It’s really dumb and lazy.” Higgins said international audiences were mostly impervious to Kremlin disinformation. But he said domestic Russian viewers tended to believe fake TV footage, which was “theatrically” created for state propaganda purposes. This was especially true of the older generation, he said. Over the past week Russia has churned out numerous false stories from what Ukraine’s foreign ministry Dmytro Kuleba called a “fake producing factory”. They include claims Ukraine is planning to attack separatist enclaves, and that it on Monday smuggled armoured vehicles and saboteurs across the border – supposedly recorded by helmet cam. The Kremlin’s media goal is to create a pretext for invasion, Higgins suggested. As part of this strategy Russian TV has begun actively promoting information which suggests a vast humanitarian crisis is unfolding in eastern Ukraine. It has claimed residents have come under heavy Ukrainian shelling – something Kyiv says is not true. The information has ranged from reports on increased bombardment to more outlandish “provocations,” such as attempted car bombing on Friday outside the separatist administration building in Donetsk. The same day the territory’s pro-Moscow leader, Denis Pushilin, released a video saying the situation had become so grave civilians had to be bussed out to safety and Russia. Pushilin’s evacuation order was released on 18 February. Bellingcat, however, discovered from the video’s meta-data on the channel Telegram that it had actually been filmed two days earlier – last Wednesday. “It’s incompetence,” Higgins said. At the time the situation across the line of control between the Ukrainian military and separatists positions was calm. A large part of Russian efforts to lay the groundwork for a Kosovo-style intervention in east Ukraine is to claim that the Ukrainian efforts to regain control of the territories in 2014 amounted to “genocide”. Putin has used the word on several occasions. He has also made comparisons to the massacre at Srebrenica in Bosnia. “What is happening in the Donbas today is genocide,” Putin said last week. Russian diplomats circulated a document at the United Nations claiming Ukraine is engaged in “exterminating the civilian population” in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Late on Sunday night Russia’s embassy in Washington sent a similar document to US journalists. The “genocide” theme was also repeatedly mentioned during Putin’s extraordinary security council meeting on Monday in Moscow. It has featured extensively in state media bulletins, leading up to the request by the separatist authorities for military and economic help from the Kremlin, as well as legal recognition, granted by Putin on Monday evening. In 2014, during the peak of the conflict, numerous mass burials were carried out, particularly in Luhansk, where the bodies of many of those who died in the war could not be buried immediately due to the intense fighting. During a visit to Luhansk in September 2014, the Guardian saw stacks of simple wooden coffins at the morgue, which were later buried in hastily dug mass graves. However, to describe the deaths in Luhansk and other parts of the current separatist areas as “genocide” is grossly misleading. Both sides used artillery on civilian areas during the gruesome battles of 2014, but there was never any mass programme to execute civilians based on ethnicity, language or political preference. Starting last summer, separatist authorities began exhuming bodies from graves, to perform DNA analysis and identify the remains of people they said had been “victims of Ukrainian aggression”. At the time, the move caused alarm among some of those monitoring the region, with a sense that the exhumations might be later used politically. Now, that seems to be happening. Meanwhile, top Russian propagandists have openly accused western leaders of warmongering. In a recent segment, Dmitry Kiselyov, who runs a primetime weekly news show, asked “who needs war?” The answer was a list of foreign leaders and dignitaries: Boris Johnson, Prince Andrew, Joe Biden, Recep Erdoğan, Emmanuel Macron and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s embattled pro-western president. For some pro-Kremlin opinion-makers, the turn toward war has been marked by a quick change in message. Margarita Simonyan, the head of RT, spent weeks mocking US and European officials for their warnings that Russia was preparing for war. But early last week, she changed her opinion: “Russia cannot but stop this war. What are we waiting for?” she asked. The video editing technology may be new, but the message is an old one. Finnish media pointed out that the Soviet Union in November 1939 used a similar excuse to start the winter war against Finland. The day before the Soviet invasion Moscow claimed that Finnish troops had launched “an attack”.",News/World news,‘Dumb and lazy’: the flawed films of Ukrainian ‘attacks’ made by Russia’s ‘fake factory’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/dumb-and-lazy-the-flawed-films-of-ukrainian-attacks-made-by-russias-fake-factory

2/22/2022,"The Treasury has announced plans to unlock more than £10bn of UK infrastructure investment through a post-Brexit overhaul of the insurance industry. Announcing a shake-up for the City of London after leaving the EU, the economic secretary to the Treasury, John Glen, said that a comprehensive package of reforms for the insurance sector would help enable UK-based firms to invest more in infrastructure projects.  Speaking at the Association of British Insurers annual dinner on Monday, he said EU-focused rules known as Solvency II would be replaced by a new UK regime that would give insurance firms more flexibility to invest capital in long-term growth projects. “EU regulation doesn’t work for us any more and the government is determined to fix that by tailoring the prudential regulation of insurers to our unique circumstances,” he said. “We have a genuine opportunity to maintain and grow an innovative and vibrant insurance sector while protecting policyholders and making it easier for insurance firms to use long-term capital to unlock growth.” The move comes as the government pushes to demonstrate there are benefits from Brexit for the British economy, despite official figures showing a dramatic drop in UK trade and ongoing criticism from business leaders over the higher costs and reams of red tape unleashed by leaving the EU. The UK’s insurance sector has been subject to the Solvency II rules since they were introduced in 2016 to harmonise regulation across the EU and promote the stability of firms after the 2008 financial crisis. Jacob Rees-Mogg, appointed as the Brexit opportunities minister earlier this month, has called for a rewriting of EU financial rules to meet the prime minister’s ambition of an “investment big bang” in Britain powered by the City of London. However, the plan for a post-Brexit regulatory overhaul is similar to changes already being pursued by Brussels to unlock €90bn (£75bn) in European insurance assets, in a process that would also have applied in the UK had it remained a member state. Under the changes being considered in the UK, the Treasury said there would be changes to enable insurers to invest in long-term assets such as infrastructure and to reduce current regulatory reporting requirements. Glen said that the reforms would still provide safeguards for policyholders from any failures in the insurance sector. “The reforms are expected to create an opportunity worth in the region of tens of billions of pounds for insurance firms to invest in long-term capital to unlock growth,” it said.",News/Business,Treasury plans post-Brexit overhaul of insurance industry,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/21/treasury-plans-post-brexit-overhaul-of-insurance-industry
2/22/2022,"Vladimir Putin’s declaration that Russia will recognise the independence of the breakaway regions of eastern Europe was greeted in the US and Europe with dismay and warnings of sanctions. There was also alarm at Putin’s warnings of further action against Ukraine as a whole, questioning the country’s legitimacy and suggesting it presented a direct threat to Russia.  “The speech was full of grudges and imperial hubris, which signifies a very dangerous turn of events,” a senior eastern European official said. “He definitely doesn’t need those occupied territories, Luhansk and Donetsk, which are in very bad shape and need a lot of money. He wants Ukraine, and it’s probably only the beginning of a larger escalation.” Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, the presidents of the European Commission and European Council, said: “The recognition of the two separatist territories in Ukraine is a blatant violation of international law, the territorial integrity of Ukraine and the Minsk agreements. “The EU and its partners will react with unity, firmness and determination in solidarity with Ukraine.” Boris Johnson said Vladimir Putin’s decision was “plainly in breach of international law. It is a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine.” The UK prime minister also described it as an “ill omen” and a “dark sign” that things were moving in the wrong direction. Alar Karis, the president of Estonia, said: “Estonia will never accept the illegal decision by Russia to recognise Donetsk and Luhansk regions. “They are an internationally recognised part of Ukraine, like Crimea. “Clearly, Moscow is not serious about diplomacy but is looking for casus belli.” The Latvian prime minister, Arturs Krišjānis Kariņš, said: “In a gross violation of international law, under a fabricated pretext, and by spreading false information, Russia seeks to induce a change in Ukraine’s political leadership and foreign policy course by violent means. “We call on the international community to action through putting in place robust economic sanctions against the Russian Federation and persons responsible for encroachment on Ukraine’s statehood,” Kariņš said. As Putin staged his security council meeting, and ahead of the Russian leader’s televised address, Joe Biden summoned his top national security officials at the White House, including CIA director William Burns and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley. It was not immediately clear whether Putin’s declaration would mean the cancellation of a potential summit between Biden and Putin. The Kremlin had earlier played down the prospect of the summit as “premature”, while the US made clear it would not take place if Russia invaded. Macron convened an urgent meeting of his national security council, while the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, demanded an emergency session of the United Nations security council. Russia is the current chair of the council, but is obliged to grant a meeting, if a council member state demands it. Ukraine’s allies in the council were waiting for a formal Ukrainian request to be present so they could call for the council meeting. European officials noted that Russian recognition of the Moscow-backed republics of Luhansk and Donetsk meant the end of the eight-year-old Minsk peace process, and in practical terms would amount to Russian annexation. At the end of a meeting of EU foreign ministers, the bloc’s foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, said a package of prepared EU sanctions would be triggered by Russian recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk territories, but he said the extent of the sanctions would reflect “the level of aggression”. He told reporters that he would put forward the action at an extraordinary meeting for the EU capitals to sign off should Vladimir Putin follow through on the threat. Borrell, who said ministers had been closely watching events in Moscow today, suggested that the punitive measures would be appropriate in scale and severity to the action taken by Russia. He said: “If there is recognition, I will put the sanctions on the table ... We have a package prepared. This package has certain components and can be implemented depending on the level of aggression.” Borrell said recognition by Russia of the independence of the eastern territories of Ukraine would be a breach of international law that the EU would not ignore. The EU has threatened “severe costs and massive consequences” in the event of a further Russian incursion into Ukraine. The package has yet to be made public but it would involve a block on exports of key electrical components on which Russia is reliant, potentially an import ban on Russian oil and gas, and the freezing of assets of individuals and companies affiliated with the government in Moscow. A senior official from an eastern European country expressed concern over whether recognition, without a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, would be enough to split European unity. “It might be not a direct invasion, but instead first of all recognition, then maybe dragging on some days or weeks before Russian so-called ‘peacekeepers’ enter Luhansk and Donetsk occupied territories,” the official said. “Then it’s a grey zone, where you are not sure if that triggers sanctions, especially for for some European Union countries which are further from from the front line.” A spokesman for the United Nations said: “We underline our call for an immediate cessation of hostilities, maximum restraint, and for all parties to avoid any action and statements that would escalate tensions further. All issues must be addressed through diplomacy.” The UN announced it was relocating non-essential staff and the families of UN officials posted in Ukraine, while bringing in other staff to support UN operations. The British foreign minister, Liz Truss, said after talks in Brussels with the Nato secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, that western countries were preparing for a “worst-case scenario”. The airlines Lufthansa, KLM and Air France cancelled flights to Kyiv. After a tense 10-hour meeting of the EU’s 27 foreign ministers, Borrell said Belarus was being annexed by Russia and its government would face the same “massive” sanctions as Moscow should there be an invasion of Ukraine from its territory. The former Spanish foreign minister said the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, was allowing his country to become a Russian satellite state.",News/World news,EU warns of sanctions as Putin recognises Ukraine breakaway regions,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/putin-eastern-europe-donetsk-luhansk-reaction
2/22/2022,"Sitting alone at a desk in a grand, columned Kremlin room, Vladimir Putin looked across an expanse of parquet floor at his security council and asked if anyone wished to express an alternative opinion. He was met with silence.  A few hours later, the Russian president appeared on state television to give an angry, rambling lecture about Ukraine, a country that in Putin’s telling had become “a colony with a puppet regime”, and had no historical right to exist. Putin’s double bill, which was immediately followed by the signing of an agreement on Russian recognition of the two proxy states in east Ukraine as independent entities, is likely to go down in history as one of the major turning points in his 22-years-and-counting rule over Russia. This was not a politician convening his team for discussions, this was a supreme leader marshalling his minions and ensuring collective responsibility for a decision that, at minimum, will change the security architecture in Europe, and may well lead to a horrific war that consumes Ukraine. Putin appeared genuinely angry and passionate in his speech, which he almost certainly wrote himself. In a symbolic sign of his increasing isolation, with no equals who can talk back to him or debate ideas, Putin has recently taken to meeting politicians, including his own ministers, across ostentatiously large tables, apparently as a Covid precaution. But at the security council meeting on Monday, when a long table for once would have seemed appropriate, Putin sat alone, surveying his subordinates from absurdly far away, as they squirmed awkwardly in chairs waiting their turn to be grilled by the boss. From behind his desk, frequently smirking, Putin listened one-by-one to his security council. The body contains some of the few people who have Putin’s ear, but even some of them appeared overawed by the situation and nervous at fluffing their lines. Sergei Naryshkin, the hawkish head of Russia’s spy service, known for making aggressively anti-western statements, stuttered uncomfortably as Putin grilled him on whether he supported the decision. “Speak directly!” Putin snapped, twice. Eventually, when he was able to get the words out, Naryshkin said he supported “the LNR and DNR becoming part of Russia.” Putin told him that wasn’t the subject of the discussion; it was only recognition being weighed up. Some suggested this might have been a carefully scripted encounter to show the West what other options might be available, but Naryshkin’s genuinely flustered expression suggested otherwise. It is hard to tell whether or not Putin had decided his plan for Ukraine months ago, or whether has been making plans on the hop, but it was certainly clear that the decision on recognition had been taken well before this strange, stage-managed event. There was very little exchange of opinion, and the idea that it was all spontaneous was further undermined by the fact that close-ups of the watches of certain participants appeared to suggest that the “live” broadcast had in fact been filmed several hours earlier. This did not stop Putin specifically emphasising that the event really was a frank exchange of views. “Every one of you knows, and I specially want to underline it ... I did not discuss any of this with you before. I did not ask your opinion before. And this is happening spontaneously, because I wanted to hear your opinions without any preliminary preparation,” he said. The appearance of Putin just a few hours later with his long, pre-prepared and wide-ranging speech made the claim this was all a real-time decision-making process even more implausible. Many of Putin’s team give the impression of genuinely believing the propaganda narrative Russia has built to justify its continuing aggression against Ukraine. Valentina Matviyenko, the only woman on the security council, gave an elongated harangue cobbled together from the more outlandish talking points of Russian news bulletins: innocent Russia facing down the nefarious West, which was backing the “genocidal” Kyiv regime. Not everyone was so enthusiastic: prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, spoke briefly and drily, looking visibly uncomfortable. Not willing to let him off the hook without swearing fealty to the decision that was already inevitably on the way, Putin asked him directly whether he supported it; Mishustin mumbled that he did. Everyone was now publicly on record as supporting this move, nobody will be able to weasel out of it later and claim they put up a fight. The recognition decision answers some questions but others remain. There is a chance Putin may simply recognise the two republics “as they are”. This, after months of apocalyptic scenarios, would probably be privately accepted as a good outcome by Ukraine and the west. But it seems likely that Putin has much more in mind than simply taking a nibble out of Ukraine’s east and taking formal responsibility for territories he already de facto controlled. Putin’s final words, that if Kyiv did not stop the violence they would bear responsibility for the “ensuing bloodshed”, were ominous in the extreme. It sounded, quite simply, like a declaration of war.",News/World news,"Putin’s absurd, angry spectacle will be a turning point in his long reign",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/putin-angry-spectacle-amounts-to-declaration-war-ukraine
