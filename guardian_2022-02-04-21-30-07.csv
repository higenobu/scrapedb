2/4/2022,"Good morning. About 6,500 people are under evacuation orders after a fire at a North Carolina fertilizer plant and fears that it could result in the largest US explosion ever.  The risk of an explosion at the Weaver Fertilizer Plant, which contains roughly 600 tons of ammonium nitrate, has “greatly diminished” over the days since the blaze ignited. The fire, which started in the north of Winston-Salem on Monday, is within a one-mile radius of about 2,500 homes, several schools and churches, a correctional facility as well as other commercial and government buildings. Has it caused air pollution? Locals say the fire has created fumes that “get in your throat and look like a very thick fog”. What is the Environmental Protection Agency’s role in this? It is not required to regulate facilities with ammonium nitrate under the Clean Air Act risk management plan. Environmental lawyers are calling for this to change. A 43-year-old woman has been killed and four others injured after a man began shooting on Greyhound bus stopped in northern California. Police arrested the suspect, 21-year-old Asaahdi Coleman, naked inside a nearby Walmart. Coleman had been exhibiting “paranoid behavior”, the Butte county sheriff, Kory Honea, said, and had accused a bus passenger of being an undercover police officer. He then opened fire as people were exiting the Los Angeles-bound vehicle, which had stopped at an AM/PM convenience store in Oroville, firing more than a dozen times. The woman died at the scene. An 11-year-old girl, a 25-year-old woman who is pregnant, a 38-year-old man and a 32-year-old man were also injured. At least one of the victims was shot multiple times. What do we know about the suspect? Coleman was wanted on a warrant out of another county for being a prohibited person in possession of a firearm. Did gun violence rise during the pandemic? The US saw its highest-ever recorded annual increase – 30% – in murders in 2020, FBI statistics show. Hundreds of truck drivers have descended on Ottawa to protest against public health measures, bringing the Canadian capital to a standstill in a situation that some fear could erupt into violence. The protest has been sparked by a requirement that truckers crossing from the US into Canada be vaccinated against Covid. The vast majority of truckers, and Canadians, are vaccinated. Police, who say their strategy is to defuse tension, say they believe a number of drivers have weapons, and that there are fears of violence as people call for a counter-protest to the blockade. Critics of the police response say that other protests, including those by Indigenous peoples, are often met with force. What does Justin Trudeau say? He dismissed suggestions of using the military to end the blockade, saying it was not going to happen “right now”. Facebook’s parent company has suffered a record single-day fall in stock market value, losing $230bn. Meta’s price fell by 26.4% after the company reported its daily user numbers had dropped for the first time ever. Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin are meeting on Friday as tensions grow between Russia and the west. The summit, as Beijing kicks off its Winter Olympics, is the Chinese’s leader’s first face-to-face meeting with a world leader in two years. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is starting to come under fire for being “inaudible” over the mounting crisis in Ukraine. He has been criticised by Kyiv and other east-central European capitals for Germany’s restrictions on weapons exports to crisis regions. Another adviser to the British prime minister Boris Johnson quit on Friday, following the resignation of four key No 10 officials on Thursday – a day dubbed the “meltdown in Downing Street”. More than 10 MPs have publicly called on Johnson to step down. Wealthy people are responsible for a growing proportion of the world’s emissions, new research shows. In 2010, the richest 10% emitted 34% of global CO2; by 2015, this was 49%. In contrast, the world’s poorest half were responsible for 15% in 2010, falling to 7% in 2015. “High consumption and large carbon footprints are spatially concentrated in high-income cities and suburbs – while their negative effects, such as air pollution, typically spill over into less affluent areas,” study author Prof Aimee Ambrose said. After the pandemic brought concerts and tours to a screeching halt almost two years ago, singer-songwriter Mitski found time to “learn how to live like a regular person”, baking and gardening at a base in Nashville. The respite from touring followed the success of her fifth album, Be the Cowboy, and the “cultish keenness” of her fanbase that came with it. She tells Ben Beaumont-Thomas about the need for boundaries, when “everyone need[s] a piece” of her, and about what it’s like to be “consumed” as an artist. “I’m a woman in public, allowing myself to be consumed. I put out songs, but really what people are buying is the product that is me.” When a family of hikers left their GoPro out to capture footage of Aotearoa’s native alpine parrot species, the kea, they didn’t expect a directorial debut from one of the New Zealand parrots. Flying off with the camera, the bird captured sweeping mountain views, avant-garde shots and, to close, a “slightly frenzied attack” on the GoPro.

2/4/2022,"Britain’s efforts to halt the flow of Russian “dirty money” into the UK have been called into question in the aftermath of the threat by the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, to hit Kremlin-linked oligarchs with economic sanctions if Ukraine is attacked. Labour and anti-corruption campaigners this week accused the government of failing to curtail Russian wealth and influence in Britain, despite years of provocative actions from the Kremlin.  “We’ve seen Russia engage in assassinations and human rights abuses, annexations and invasions – but it has taken 100,000 Russian troops at the border to push Britain towards a change of policy,” said James Nixey, a director at the Chatham House thinktank, which recently published a paper on the UK’s kleptocracy problem. Truss would not spell out who might be targeted, partly for legal reasons, but she told MPs it could include “those who own or control” companies that have economic or strategic significance to the Russian state. Roman Borisovich, an anti-corruption campaigner, who runs “kleptocracy tours” highlighting Russian oligarch-owned properties in London, said Truss’s threat sent out the opposite signal. Because sanctions would come only in the event of an invasion, the implied message was, he said, “play nice, you are welcome to come with your stolen loot”. As fortunes were made following the fall of the Soviet Union, Russian elites, who owe their wealth to an all-powerful Kremlin, have been eager to move money from home. So vast is the flight of capital it has been estimated that Russians hold as much as $1tn in wealth abroad, according to the Atlantic Council thinktank. Transparency International, an anti-corruption watchdog, believes that 150 properties, mostly luxury mansions in Britain worth an estimated £1.5bn, are owned by Kremlin-linked Russians. More may be held by offshore companies, whose true ownership is hard to determine. Politicians have benefited. Russian-born donors or individuals with business links to Russia have given nearly £2m to either the Conservative party or individual constituency associations since Boris Johnson took power in July 2019, according to Electoral Commission figures. Checks were minimal in some cases. Seven hundred wealthy Russians were among those allowed to enter the UK on Tier 1 investor visas between 2008 and 2015, a period when no state checks were carried out. All Tier 1 visas granted in that period are now subject to a Home Office national security review, says NGO Spotlight on Corruption. Former insiders – from policing and Whitehall – complain about a lack of resources and, by implication, political will. “Proving the illicit nature of the funds often needs information from the source country, very hard in some cases,” said one. “The subjects are rich and will employ the legal system of this country to its fullest degree.” Too many agencies are involved, a former senior security official added. “The British state has not put enough effort and money in tackling fraud across the board – illegal economic activity, dirty money. It’s too spread out between the National Crime Agency, the Serious Fraud Office, City of London police and even local forces.” A week ago, Theodore Agnew, a former Lords Treasury minister, said one of the reasons for his resignation was that a proposed economic crime bill had been “foolishly rejected” for the next Queen’s speech by business managers. On Wednesday, in a U-turn, Johnson told MPs it would be put on the list. “Contrary to some of the myths that are peddled, this government have come down very hard on dirty money from Russia and everywhere else,” the prime minister added, and highlighted recently introduced anti-corruption measures, such as unexplained wealth orders. These orders were introduced in 2017, and intended to force politically exposed persons to explain the origins of the money, if they had bought an expensive property that appeared beyond their means. The property or asset could, in theory, be seized if no adequate explanation were provided. The Home Office predicted that 20 orders would be issued every year. In fact, only four are known to have been issued in four years, and none since Boris Johnson took office, according toChatham House. No Russian has been targeted either. Labour’s shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, said British interests were being damaged. He said: “The Conservatives’ inexplicable record of failure in stopping corrupt elites from Russia and other authoritarian regimes storing money in our country is weakening Britain’s security, harming our national interests and undermining our diplomacy.” Such is the level of Russian influence in the UK, that the US is said to have become worried. Max Bergmann, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a Joe Biden-aligned thinktank, told the Guardian he believed “there is clear concern in the US government about the influence of Russian money in the UK”. A week earlier, Bergmann had written a widely picked up report into the Ukraine crisis, callng for the US to establish a joint kleptocracy working group with the UK “to prod stronger action” from the Conservative government. This week, the White House said it was proceeding with it in tandem with the UK. Economic sanctions would focus on individuals “in or near the inner circles of the Kremlin”, an administration official said, should an invasion take place. Lists of targets have been drawn up: a shortlist of eight by allies of the jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, which was debated in the UK parliament last year. A public list of 35 also appears in the Putin accountability bill, put forward by members of the US Congress last month. But economic sanctions are unlikely to involve those who have gone on to make millions in donations to the Conservatives. None feature on the two lists – and it is unlikely the Tories would in effect admit money had been taken from people deemed too close to the Kremlin in the event of war. Borisovich, meanwhile, told the Guardian he plans to restart his “kleptocracy tours” in London this spring, as the pandemic subsides. This time, he hopes there will be an extra twist. “I would like to extend an invitation to MPs from the foreign affairs select committee,” he said.",News/Politics,Ministers accused of failing to stem flow of Russian ‘dirty money’ into UK,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/04/ministers-accused-of-failing-to-stem-flow-of-russian-money-into-uk
2/4/2022,"It might be forbidden to say so openly in the House of Commons, but most of Boris Johnson’s political opponents – and, probably, some of his supporters – would agree he has a reputation for telling lies. He has been accused of telling fibs big and small throughout his premiership on everything from Brexit to the Downing Street parties. So how did he do this week? The Guardian has looked at his various statements and rated them for honesty.  Facts: The UK was certainly among the quickest countries in starting vaccinations, but defining “fastest” depends where you draw the line, with several neighbours having since vaccinated more per head of population. The connection to Brexit has been debunked. EU countries could temporarily authorise vaccines unilaterally if needed – as the UK did in November 2020, when it was still under the Brexit transition agreement. Verdict: Partly true-ish, partly lie. Facts: Starmer was DPP from 2008-13, a period when the broadcaster was interviewed by police and died without being charged for decades of sexual offences. He also apologised for prosecution failings. But he had no connection to decisions over the case, and the idea he did emerged later in conspiracy theories mainly shared among the far right. Verdict: Lie – and eventually partially withdrawn by Johnson, but not before his longstanding policy chief, Munira Mirza, resigned because the prime minister had not apologised. She said: “There was no fair or reasonable basis for that assertion. This was not the normal cut-and-thrust of politics; it was an inappropriate and partisan reference to a horrendous case of child sex abuse.” Facts: Another angry response to Starmer, this appeared to refer to the Labour leader’s claim that the interim Gray report showed “evidence of serious and flagrant breaches of lockdown”, or perhaps that there had been “absurd denials” about parties. While Johnson is correct that the police have not yet charged anyone, the fact the report showed 12 events had sufficient weight of evidence to merit an investigation does demonstrate Starmer’s claim also had weight. Verdict: Overblown – and perhaps desperate. Facts: Johnson says this regularly, and it is, at best, disputed. The UK is top in terms of the latest year-on-year GDP G7 growth table, but was fifth in the two most recent quarterly figures, from the second and third quarters of 2021. Verdict: Debatable. Facts: This claim is taken from crime statistics for England and Wales for the year to the end of June 2021. Crime did fall by 14% – but only if you exclude fraud and computer misuse. Overall crime rose by 12%. The fall in non-theft crime came largely from fewer thefts, which was in turn because of repeated lockdowns. Verdict: Lie – and Johnson was later criticised for it by the UK Statistics Authority. Facts: There are more payrolled employees than before Covid, but the total number of people in work, if you include the self-employed, is still slightly lower. Verdict: Misleading. Facts: This is a reference to October’s budget, which changed the so-called taper rate for universal credit, so that the amount of the benefit a worker will lose for every pound they earn above their allowance was reduced to 55p in the pound from 63p. This is, however, not a “tax”. At £2bn a year, it is also notably less than the £6bn for the £20-a-week UC uplift brought in during the pandemic, now scrapped. Verdict: Misleading. Facts: This was in response to a question about Johnson’s comments on Starmer and Savile, and the subsequent resignation of Mirza. But, as we saw above, Johnson’s initial comment very much did seek to implicate the opposition leader. Verdict: A lie about a lie.",News/Politics,Truth and lies: how honest was Boris Johnson this week?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/04/truth-and-lies-how-honest-was-boris-johnson-this-week

2/4/2022,"On an island not known for its snow or ice, something is stirring. Not so long ago when Team GB turned up at the Winter Games, they left with their medal cupboard looking barren or bare. Sure, there was the occasional highlight – and those of a certain age will see Robin Cousins, Torvill and Dean and Rhona Martin in their mind’s eye – but as a winter sports country, Britain carried a distinct whiff of Eddie the Eagle: harmless and a little bit hapless. The transformation has been stark. Between 1952 and 2010, the nation won just 12 medals in 16 Winter Games. Then came a quiet revolution. In Sochi in 2014 there was a five-medal haul, a tally equalled in Pyeongchang in 2018. Now there is a bullish confidence that the team can do even better in Beijing.  As Britain’s chef de mission, Georgina Harland put in her message to athletes in the team handbook: “Team GB arrives in Beijing with a talented team, more competitive across more disciplines than ever before. We continue to grow as a winter nation and that is down to the performances you as athletes continue to achieve every season.” What has caused such a turnaround? A combination of tech, talent, money and new Olympic events. The tech has been most pronounced in the skeleton, where Britain has used the same aerodynamic and skinsuit technology that helped propel Britain’s track cyclists to success. Amy Williams in 2010, and Lizzy Yarnold in 2014 and 2018, reaped the benefits with gold medals. Money? When it comes to winning more medals, Rule 101 is that spending more probably helps. In curling’s case, for instance, they have been able to build a national centre in Stirling in 2017 which has led to almost immediate results. GB’s three teams – mixed, men and women – are able to train full-time in a state of the art facility and have three realistic shots of glory in Beijing. The new events? Remember curling, a game played seriously by a small number of countries, was only reintroduced as a demonstration sport in 1988. While the exciting snowboard and free-skiing events are an even more recent addition. Despite many of its athletes learning on dry ski slopes rather than real snow, Britain’s flicks and tricks department has punched above its weight. And the talent? Here a mixture of homegrown stars combined with the controversial acquisition of those British roots – including snowboard cross athlete Charlotte Bankes, who previously competed for France, and halfpiper Gus Kenworthy, who used to represent the US – has given Britain a team that could yet win seven medals, the top end of its target. Some caution is advised, of course. In many high-tariff events such as big air, where competitors perform a spectacular trick after flying off a massive ramp, the level of variance is higher than in, say, rowing or cycling or running. Another injection of randomness comes from the Covid situation. So far no British athlete has tested positive but as the Alpine skier Dave Ryding puts it: “It’s always on everyone’s mind. You wake up in the morning, and you’re like: why is my throat hurting? Your roommate will probably tell you you’ve been ripping out some snoring all night, but the first thing you think is: what am I coming down with? “It does bring more stress and that makes it harder and draining,” added the 35-year-old, who believes he has a shot at a medal after his recent World Cup win. “But we’ve been through it for two years now. So we all know what to expect and what to do.” When it comes to medals, Bankes is considered Britain’s gold medal banker, and the mixed and men’s curlers will fancy their chances too. But it would be unwise to discount the men’s four-man bobsleigh, given they have peppered the podium this season. Meanwhile Zoe Atkin, James Woods and 17-year-old Kirsty Muir all have live shots in freestyle skiing, and if British skeleton can find more secrets in their bag of tech tricks, Matt Weston might yet figure in the medals. Is it possible that Britain has its best ever Winter Games? Of course. However there is a sense that what happens in Beijing is only part of a wider project that involves climbing higher in the medal table, with GB Snowsport setting their sights on being a top five skiing and snowboard nation by 2030. Is spending the money needed to succeed philosophically desirable, given the country is not a winter sports nation? Good question – although probably one for the end of these Games not the start. For now, Team GB expects. And Andy Anson, the British Olympic Association’s chief executive, believes its athletes can deliver. “The past two Winter Olympics have seen Team GB achieve record medal returns,” he says. “And having seen the depth of our talent with our team of 50 athletes, I have no doubt we are on track to succeed once again.”",Sport/Sport,"How tech, talent and money turned Britain into a winter sports nation",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/04/charlotte-bankes-leads-charge-as-new-tech-turns-gb-into-winter-games-force
2/4/2022,"My abiding memory of chef Dom Robinson’s Renaissant, a fine-dining restaurant in Bagnor, Berkshire, is of witnessing the greatest standoff over a tasting menu I’ve ever seen. A couple had foolishly arrived for their Saturday-night booking, imagining there to be an à la carte menu, rather than just a bespoke seven-course experience that lasts about three hours. “But we went out for lunch,” they pleaded. “We’re too full to eat the full seven courses. Can’t we have just, say, three?” Sadly, this was impossible. Unthinkable, even. It was the full shebang, or nothing. A painfully polite, low-volume “discussion” then ensued, during which the server made no attempt to consult the chef. Or even offer a goodwill gesture to cancel, say, the “baguette française, Normandy butter” course, or the Victoria pineapple plate that comes around the midway point. It was almost as if the staff already knew that not one amuse-bouche could be missed. “Well, we’ll go then,” the customers eventually said, calling Renaissant’s bluff. A long silence hung in the air, followed by the sound of footsteps crunching across the car park gravel as the pair huffed back to their car. It was only 7pm.  I hasten to add that the handful of staff at this beautifully restored, 17th-century pub were charming about our own request to take pork off the menu; they’re not tyrants. Yet Renaissant, the rebirth of the Blackbird, which was also run by Robinson and his wife, Marliz, is a determinedly serious restaurant. Not that its predecessor wasn’t itself pretty serious – the Blackbird had a Michelin star but at least you could get a Sunday roast or even a burger there – perish the thought. Renaissant is much more scallop à la russe and wild boar africaine, with a framed menu from Marco Pierre White’s Harveys on the wall and Edith Piaf on the stereo. As one arrives on a crisp winter’s evening, the outside is secluded, glowing and pristine, and all quite heavenly. Inside, the decor is sleek, but still strangely rustic. Robinson describes the place as a “sauce restaurant”, which, for a certain contingent of readers, I must add has nothing to do with his love of HP and everything to do with Georges Auguste Escoffier’s kitchen brigade system and the culinary tradition of classic sauces such as Véronique, lie de vin or Nantua. Producing top-tier sauces, gravies and stocks is a long-winded, highly skilled labour of love that has been known to break the spirit of many an adequate chef and is the crux of a traditional Michelin-starred meal. Which is possibly why you can’t just pitch up here and say: “Just sling me the fillet of brill lie de vin. I need to be back before Ant and Dec’s Limitless Win.” So, yes, three hours we stayed, with course one being warm bread, then a fairly long gap before the second act, a play on Russian salad involving brunoise potato, beetroot and carrot set in a mould and topped with scallops – a bit like a shuba herring salad and delicious, if a touch stodgy. Up next was a large, delicately executed crayfish raviolo featuring good fresh pasta enveloping a crayfish tail that came on a scallop and salmon mousse, and was served with a very sweet sauce Nantua made with crayfish stock, parsley and rather a lot of diced carrot. There is no doubt that Robinson is a confident, technically brilliant chef who worships at the altar of kitchen gods such as Nico Ladenis and the Roux brothers. His cooking is a paean to butter and time spent huddled over pans, and to dancing a fine line between the almost-too-rich and the almost-too-much. It’s just that type of cooking, and it won’t be for everyone. It certainly wasn’t for those two guests who “amicably agreed” to go home. But there’s a reason a certain type of chin-stroking, star-watching food obsessive is pitching up at Renaissant. After another long intermission, a very delicious plate of thinly sliced Victoria pineapple appeared topped with ricotta, powerfully scented marjoram leaves and a scattering of pine nuts. Hour two heralded my favourite course – seared brill with pomme puree in a world-class, glossy, red-wine sauce and topped with a clove of mellow roast garlic – followed some time after by a cheese course that included comté and bleu d’Auvergne with a highly unpretentious half-dozen Carr’s water crackers, and I now fully expect to be barred from my home city for raising an eyebrow. Over the course of the third hour, there was a pear-based, egg-cup-sized palate cleanser and two choices of dessert, of which the better was a slab of dark-chocolate Negus mousse – fiercely rich, yet deceptively light – with armagnac-soaked prunes, which are one of my favourite things on Earth and technically one of your five-a-day. Renaissant is a bizarre, 19th-century Cannes aristocrat’s supper room hiding in a hamlet outside Newbury. If you’re into that type of thing, by all means give it a go.

2/4/2022,"Agripping account of the negotiations between Britain and Germany in 1938 before the outbreak of war, Robert Harris’s thriller – which has now been adapted into a film starring Jeremy Irons – focuses on the backrooms of power and peripheral figures working to avert catastrophe. At the centre of the story is Hugh Legat, a civil servant who, at the start of the novel, is dragged away from an anniversary lunch with his wife for a meeting at No 10.  Events take place over four tense days at the end of September, during which the prime minister Neville Chamberlain goes to Munich for talks with Hitler, who is intent on invading Czechoslovakia. On his return, Chamberlain famously stepped off the plane waving a written assurance of peace from the Führer, a moment that would come to stain his reputation. This is no alternative history in the manner of Harris’s Fatherland, though there are heavily fictionalised elements including Legat and his friendship with Paul von Hartmann, an old chum from Oxford who is now a diplomat at the Nazi foreign ministry. David Rintoul is our steady and authoritative narrator, bringing suitable graveness to early conversations in London when war appears inevitable – Legat’s children have even been fitted for gas masks – and during which it is revealed that Britain’s air force is calamitously unprepared. As the action moves to Europe, Rintoul subtly evokes the toughness and veiled contempt of German officials without descending into theatrics (you’ll find no ’Allo ’Allo!-style accents here).

2/4/2022,"Then the War: And Selected Poems 2007-2020 by Carl Phillips (Carcanet, £14.99)Phillips’s new collection arrives carrying a Selected Poems on its shoulder. The 208 pages form a wonderfully compendious introduction to this major US poet. For those who have admired his work in the three decades since his debut, they are glowing confirmation that, as he enters his 60s, Phillips is writing better than ever. The poems that open Then the War are extraordinary ecological lyric verse, subtle and transformative. Invasive Species gives the plant switchgrass a voice: “Little song years remastering truth / now begins its own truth little song / deep in the night”; a poem about leaves is called Little Shields, in Starlight. This metamorphic fluidity allows us to understand our natural environment in a new way, and ensures these poems remain fully populated, by parents, lovers and friends. Phillips himself is in the frame in the reflexive sequence Among the Trees, a series of encounters with the natural world – and with love. The selection from earlier books that follows now reads as part of a single project of the utmost immediacy.  Lurex by Denise Riley (Picador, £10.99)Lurex is Riley’s first collection since the stunning elegy Say Something Back in 2016. It continues her robust, knotty work of setting down the sinews and resistances of actual experience. Never hung up on the merely ornamental, her poetry describes the physical world, or worlds of emotion, in terms that equal their seriousness. Even when she’s evoking, in Fishers of Men, the much-pictured scene where Christ summons fishermen to become disciples, the alliterative to-fro thump of consonants creates a mimetic storm on Galilee: “A bruised sea, barracked by storms […] / where water slaps the air, where air /drills into water.” Slow Burn is a furious take on ageing: for “A halfhearted recruit to the sect of post-sexuals […] / Evenings float under television, rather than into amnesiac scholarship.” Furious too is the poem 1948, in its indictment of what it meant to be born out of wedlock – “how it fell out / for surplus postwar children. / The indifferently falling rains of them”. No cosy resolution here: Riley is arguably Britain’s major living modernist poet, and her every line proves the importance of this hard-won way of telling. Ephemeron by Fiona Benson (Jonathan Cape, £12)A new collection of Benson’s wise and vivid work is a real occasion. Divided into four sections, Ephemeron highlights her unusual range. Insect Love Songs, a commissioned series of ecological poems, is followed by two sequences of confessional poetry and a long sequence, Translations from the Pasiphaë. These tales from Greek myth are at their strongest where most viscerally inhabited, and visceral they are: a keel-hauled teenager turned to “pulp, // unrecognisable, a raw lump”; Minos, consumed by sexually transmitted disease, “raving that he ejaculated scorpions / centipedes and serpents into maidens”. They extend the fine, terrifying poetics of Robin Robertson, her editor and its dedicatee. But the book’s most exciting work, fully inhabited and multi-faceted, is contained in the sequences Boarding-School Tales and Daughter Mother. Avoiding the contiguous snares of sweetness or scatter-gun emotion, they transcend their context of social privilege to enter into the high stakes of real life, in which every daughter must learn “how if you are female or small, you must run”. Why I No Longer Write Poems by Diana Anphimiadi, translated by Natalia Bukia-Peters and Jean Sprackland (Bloodaxe, £12.99)This collection by a leading Georgian poet is part of the Poetry Translation Centre’s programme commissioning British poets – here, Jean Sprackland – to work with literary translators. In this case, that’s Natalia Bukia-Peters, who also provides a knowledgeable Introduction setting this work in the national context of epic poetry, and of a vocabulary of myth. For this is gorgeous, fabulising verse. Medusa tells us: “This is what happens: I breathe, I exist. / My heart is a choking tumour, near the breast.” Dance Lessons enjoins: “Step: as if the moon / exploded, and your /feet were the pieces,” and the writing does feel constantly in motion. Bloodaxe is especially to be commended for publishing this important work in bilingual edition. Hurricane Watch: New and Collected Poems by Olive Senior (Carcanet, £25)Senior, currently poet laureate of Jamaica, has been producing poetry of beauty and historical resonance for nearly four decades. Hurricane Watch shows her continually remaking the story of cultural exile and belonging. That she plunders a range of traditions to do so itself tells that story. Meditation on Red excavates a Devon graveyard to rediscover Jean Rhys; Crusoe’s Parrot represents a writer in exile; African Gods in the New World brings a pantheon to life; elsewhere are birdcalls and counting rhymes. While the 2007 collection Shell honours the people enslaved on plantations alongside the Chinese and Indian plantation labourers who replaced them, and celebrates indigenous Caribbean peoples, the eight-part Ode to Pablo Neruda is a poem of poetic vocation shared across two continents “allowing me to explore boundlessness”.

2/4/2022,"Michael Gove should be a bishop, not a politician. He smiles. He nods. He declares “missions” and blesses all and sundry. His current diocese is Britain’s northern cities, which are suffering the worst regional disparity of any OECD country and said to be crippling the British economy. Boris Johnson has acknowledged this in his “levelling up” agenda. But to govern is to govern, not just to mean well. Gove’s Wednesday sermon on levelling up meant well, but he might have been speaking of a distant province of a forgotten empire. The people of the north, he said, deserved better transport, better education, better housing, training, health, science, anything you cared to mention. They should have it, God willing. He promised that mayors would be appointed, plans formulated and 22,000 civil servants sent out from London, like missionaries to the unwashed. But please don’t mention money. It is so vulgar.  The clear reality is that British regional policy has barely moved on since the days of Clement Attlee. Gove’s speech could have been delivered in 1947. To him, the cities of the north need big government and central spending. Making them level with the south is about more infrastructure and more welfare. That is what macho British ministers always say: theirs is a job for spades, diggers and hi-vis jackets. If this was the end of the matter, the outlook for levelling up would be bleak, as it would seem there is no money to spare. Yet I tried to imagine the citizens of Frankfurt, Toulouse or Milan, let alone New York or Los Angeles, hanging on the goodwill of distant politicians for their future. I tried to imagine them being patted on the head by Gove and told to be patient. The whole Gove project is unreal. The only region Whitehall recognises is London. Reality is the chancellor Rishi Sunak’s infrastructure mega-projects: Crossrail in central London and a high-speed commuter line into London from Birmingham. Sunak embodies the so-called Matthew effect: “To them that hath shall it be given.” The great unmentioned truth in any debate on the north-south divide is not the deprivation of the north, serious though it may be. It is the magnetism of London. It is summed up in a meeting of Manchester businessmen I once attended. They never mentioned infrastructure. They cried with one voice, “Why does London steal our young people?” I likewise recall a northern woman telling me that all her children and grandchildren had gone south, and never would return. When I commiserated, she beamed and said, “Oh no. They’ve all done very well.” Gove did hint at this in his mission to improve something called “pride of place”. The dominance of London over all other English cities is unlike that of the capital of any other developed country. At its root is the steady disempowerment of these cities, stripped of their self-government until they are mere agencies of Whitehall. Northern cities cannot now await London cash, least of all those not among Gove’s bizarre “top 20”, chosen for his special favour. Their revival will only start with a newly confident local leadership. Gove hints at more devolution and localism – a political promise so often made but never fulfilled. England’s current elected mayors are a powerless shambles that confuse cities and regions. Liverpool and Bristol both have two overlapping ones. Every city and town should clearly have one mayor, executive and plenipotentiary. This is extremely common in Europe. The additional devolution of wider local control has had mixed results in Wales and Scotland, but it unquestionably boosts local pride and morale. Gove should give cities and counties tax-raising powers and far more fiscal discretion. With local taxes accounting for such a tiny percentage of public sector revenue, this is a recipe for Whitehall deciding everything. Virtually the only real discretion British provincial cities have is over property development. This is why the leaders of Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and Bristol can think of no way of competing with London other than by erecting garish towers of luxury flats in their central areas. They ignore the evidence that modern “creative clusters” – in design, marketing, the arts and entertainment – are drawn to historic neighbourhoods and old converted buildings. Manchester’s Northern Quarter and Birmingham’s Jewellery Quarter are the Sohos and Shoreditches of the future, yet they are desperately under-protected. Northern cities regard their Victorian heritage as a liability not an asset. They should ponder last week’s lavish London edition of Country Life. Significantly not a single modern development was pictured. Every up-and-coming neighbourhood, street or house in the magazine was built in the 19th century or before. That is true magnetism. The idea that government bulldozers and concrete mixers will reignite the vitality of these places is absurd. They need saving, not digging. If conservation is one spur to civic renewal, the other is culture. Britain’s artistic and creative life is dominated by London. To see Hull and now Coventry declared “UK city of culture” is heartwarming – for Hull in 2017 it was worth a reported £220m in investment. But it demonstrates the yawning gulf with the capital. Every modern city should be a city of culture, all the time, and not have to be declared it (by London). The report last week that the V&A and the British Museum had brushed aside Gove’s request to establish northern branches spoke volumes about modern Britain. He is the boss. He should emphatically redirect cultural spending away from London, and compel its museums to disgorge from their basements hidden treasures that belong not to them but to the nation. Last week the streets of London’s West End were heaving as the capital roared back to pre-Covid prosperity. You could feel the excitement. But the metropolis is truly blessed. Its galleries and museums, its music and opera are heavily subsidised, as is its transportation. We all know that London’s taxes support the north, but as my Manchester businessmen complained, it “taxes” the rest of Britain of its youthful talent in return. If Johnson is to deny the north large sums of public spending, he can at least demand that London offers instead some of its magnetism. For it is that magnetism that will help the north back to prosperity. England’s great cities should be liberated to recover the civic pride they once enjoyed. That is their one secure renaissance.

2/4/2022,"At the weekend, we went to the Big Apple Circus, and let me tell you those places have changed. Instead of a sad elephant chained up outside the Big Top – standard in my childhood, unthinkable today – there is “Diana Vedyashkina and her adorable dachshunds!” Creepy clowns are out; Jim Carrey-type stuntmen are in. The ringmaster is called Alan and delivers a long speech about realising one’s dreams and the tightrope artist brings on his 70-year-old mother, who, he informs us, has just had a hip replacement, and has her do a quick turn on the wire. It is an extremely satisfying night out.  What lingers into Monday is the power and purity of the imagery. As with a lot of modern entertainment, a self-help script has been bolted on in an effort to lift the evening from merely diverting to inspirational. It’s a needless tautology. If you can’t extract an analogy for your life or small business from a performer balancing on a pile of cylinders and cones on a platform 20 feet up with no safety net, or an escape artist submerged in a tank full of water, fighting desperately to unchain himself and break free, entertainment in general and the circus in particular probably isn’t for you. It’s not the risk that thrills here, although I do wonder if the tumblers and trapeze artists hold the earth-bound jugglers in low esteem. (I bet the jugglers look down on the dog trainers, meanwhile, even though the performing dachshunds are actually quite cool). What lifts it is the experience of seeing one’s internal weather so precisely externalised. I must have a very basic psychology, because while I identify strongly with the wobbling man and the man in the death tank, it’s the juggler who eventually undoes me. Katya Nikiforova juggles four, five, then six balls in the air, at which point the lights go out and adding a seventh ball, she juggles on, impossibly, in darkness. I have come with my two children and a friend and her five children, and together we watch as the balls rise and fall. To my amazement, I have a strong urge to cry. It could be a Covid thing, or a middle age thing, or a winter in New York thing – it is -12C outside and the snow is piled high – but as my friend jams her elbow into my ribs, I know she’s thinking exactly the same thing as I am: there it is, life, an endless exercise in juggling in the dark with balls you can’t see. News reaches us that Elon Musk, continuing to charm his way across every demographic, has been DMing a 19-year-old student from Florida. There are, admittedly, worse types of DMs: Musk asked Jack Sweeney, a first-year student at the University of Central Florida, if he would take down @ElonJet, a Twitter feed created by Sweeney to track the passage of Musk’s private jet, using publicly available information. Musk offered him $5,000; Sweeney, cheekily, asked for $50,000 and an internship at Tesla. A person with regular responses might have seen the potential PR in this. Musk, of course, promptly ghosted the teenager and proceeded to make the information less trackable using a data-blocking program. Sweeney neatly side-stepped the block and the feed remains active. “He probably will be mad now,” he said, showing, on top of his tech skills, advanced skills in public service. I might not know what phrases like “data-blocking methods” actually mean, but I do know a scam when I hear one. “I’m calling from the Department of Social Security, where your account has been breached,” says a man from a blocked number. “What?” “This is the third time we’ve tried to call you, it’s your last chance to cooperate without serious consequences.” I pause to consider this. “If I’m the victim of the crime, what are the consequences?” There’s a long pause. “Do you see what I mean?” I say. “It doesn’t make sense.” “This is your last chance,” repeats the man, “or you’ll be in trouble with the government.” I feel sorry for him, trying to push through an honest day’s scamming, tell him to contact me in writing and hang up. A day later, another scam, this one by text and encouraged, almost certainly, by stories like the one about that guy who texted a wrong number and ended up being included in a stranger’s Thanksgiving for the next six years. “Heyy are you Jonah? It’s Olivia, we msged on OK Cupid before when I went to visit my grandmother. I’m back if you wanted 2 meet?” I totally fall for this. Aw, poor girl, I think. “So sorry, you have the wrong number!” She replies, instantly. “Wow did I actually chat up some random dude? Oh my gosh I’m so sorry.” Still the penny doesn’t drop. “You really have the wrong number, I’m a 46-year-old of mom of two. Good luck!” She texts a generic-looking photo and says “What’s ur name? Want to txt?” Oh, now I see. Blocked and reported, though I have to hand it to the 50-year-old guy working his angles, this is next-level phishing. The grandmother was a particularly nice touch. David Beckham has recorded a podcast with Ruth Rogers of the River Cafe in which he reveals that his wife, Victoria, has “eaten the same meal every day for 25 years”. In a long, jolly anecdote the footballer recounts how, “she only eats grilled fish, steamed vegetables; she will very rarely deviate from that. The only time she’s probably ever shared something that’s been on my plate was actually when she was pregnant with Harper, and it was the most amazing thing … It was one of my favourite evenings. I can’t remember what it was but I know she’s not eaten it since!” The tone of this revelation, and the publicity around it, was in the spirit of a man affectionately teasing his wife. In her own, earlier appearance on the same podcast, Victoria Beckham cheerfully talks about an eating regimen with no oil, butter, or sauce, and in which her idea of “comfort food” is brown toast with a smattering of salt. There are worse tragedies in the world than a rich, famous woman who can’t eat, but to present it as anything other than grimly fanatical really sticks in the throat. A man from Home Depot comes to look at my kitchen. This is the circus working it’s magic: I can do this impossible thing I’ve been putting off forever. I can do a renovation. My kitchen is from 1961, the appliances from the 1980s. I moved into the apartment eight years ago and haven’t done a single thing to it. The man sits at my table and asks about taps. I have no strong feelings about taps, something that, before this moment, has never felt like a deficit. He asks about tiles for the backsplash and I inch away from him like he pulled out a knife. “These handles, or these?” he says, pushing a ring binder in my direction. “Sounds fine,” I say. He looks confused. He starts muttering about counter tops – “I have samples in the car.” Oh, god, I’ve made a terrible mistake. I know it, he knows it. He could put a timeshare in Florida on the end of my invoice and I’d sign just to make this thing end.

2/4/2022,"At least five of Boris Johnson’s key aides have resigned. Here’s a roundup of who has left, who may go next and who is likely to remain.  Munira MirzaJohnson’s longstanding policy chief, Mirza resigned on Thursday with a blistering email criticising Boris Johnson’s attempt to smear Keir Starmer over the failure to prosecute Jimmy Savile. Jack DoyleJohnson’s communications director, Doyle took over from James Slack, the former adviser whose leaving party was held on the eve of Prince Philip’s funeral and is being investigated by the Met. A former Daily Mail journalist, Doyle is believed to have been involved both in some of the gatherings and in Johnson’s initial response to the revelations. Martin ReynoldsJohnson previously worked with Reynolds in the Foreign Office, and brought him in to be his principal private secretary – a powerful gatekeeper role. Reynolds was the author of a leaked email urging colleagues to “bring your own booze” to a gathering on 20 May 2020. He is returning to the Foreign Office. Dan RosenfieldA former Treasury official who had joined the private sector, Rosenfield was a surprise appointment when he was announced as Johnson’s chief of staff in 2020, after Dominic Cummings left Downing Street. He had been criticised as lacking political nous though Johnson trusted him, involving him closely in reshuffles, for example. Elena NarozanskiThe special adviser to Johnson on women and equalities, digital, culture, media and sport, and extremism resigned her post in No 10’s policy unit, according to the editor of Conservative Home. Dougie SmithMunira’s partner is a longstanding Tory aide who works at Downing Street. He is known to be close to the leadership frontrunner Rishi Sunak. Simon CaseHandpicked by Johnson and brought back into Whitehall from Kensington Palace, Case was initially put in charge of investigating “partygate”, but stepped aside after it emerged that a lockdown gathering was held in his own office. Alex ChalkChalk is not a No 10 adviser but a minister, the solicitor general. Reportedly on resignation watch from the whips, he represents the marginal seat of Cheltenham and may feel that standing up for Johnson over partygate and the Savile comments is unlikely to be popular with his constituents. If he did quit, it would signal the crisis has moved beyond Johnson’s Downing Street operation. Henry Cook, Henry Newman and Simone FinnMany of Johnson’s remaining senior advisers were formerly close to the levelling-up secretary, Michael Gove – they include “the two Henries”, Cook and Newman, and the deputy chief of staff, Lady Finn. Andrew GriffithThe new head of Johnson’s policy unit, replacing Mirza, Griffith has been made a minister. He is a former senior business figure who has been an MP since 2019.",News/Politics,"Boris Johnson’s No 10 team: who’s out, who’s at risk and who’s staying?",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/04/boris-johnson-no-10-team-who-is-out-at-risk-staying
2/4/2022,"Welcome to this week’s edition of the Guide – I’m filling in for Gwilym Mumford with your roundup of recommendations for what to read, watch and listen to, and pop cultural conversation starters.  On that note, has there been a bigger cultural conversation starter this week than the beef between Neil Young and Joe Rogan (and by extension a little streaming service called Spotify)? Rogan, a man described by the New York Times as “Oprah for the Creatine-taking set”, sold the rights to his podcast The Joe Rogan Experience to the music/tech giants for $100m in 2020. Fast forward to 2022, and he has been accused by experts of spreading vaccine misinformation on his show – not least through an interview with a controversial vaccine scientist and sceptic, Dr Robert Malone, who claimed that the public had been “hypnotised” into following Covid rules. Neil Young – godfather of grunge, veteran of rock – withdrew his music from the streaming service in protest, followed by Joni Mitchell, podcaster Brené Brown, comedian Stewart Lee and a smattering of other musicians. While it seems unlikely that this exodus will bring down Spotify, who control 31% of the music streaming market worldwide, stranger things have happened (and imagine what would happen if Taylor Swift or Ed Sheeran joined in?)Perhaps though, besides restarting tired “culture war” conversations about free speech, the biggest thing that this whole affair highlights is the fact that podcasting – even in its most high-profile form – is something of a wild west. Spotify has said it will add warnings to podcasts which discuss coronavirus, advising listeners to do their own research … but is it a case of too little too late? Unsafe and sound Spotify is, to many, merely a music streaming company, but the Swedish behemoth has been steadily investing in other forms of audio in the past few years, acquiring podcast companies like Anchor and Gimlet, signing up the likes of Rogan, and partnering with production companies like the Obamas’ Higher Ground outfit. But even podcasting’s big leagues are devoid of regulation like that seen with television, which is presided over by Ofcom in the UK and the FCC in the US. A quick Spotify search for “Covid hoax” brings up a glut of worrying recommendations, including one show which claims in its title that Covid vaccines contain HIV. It’s not just amateur shows which are a cause for concern, either. In 2019, the Guardian asked whether podcasting was “a disaster waiting to happen”, citing incidents including alleged plagiarism in the podcasts Crime Junkie and The Dollop, and questions around the ethics of Serial spin-off S-Town, which posthumously chronicled the life of a reclusive Alabama resident who died by suicide. That a major podcast might spread vaccine misinformation hardly seems shocking when you consider the US media market and some of other podcast controversies of recent times, including the New York Times retracting its Islamic State-themed series Caliphate after a central figure was found to have fabricated his account of life as a jihadist in Syria. Meanwhile, a drama based on the 1982 killing of a Chinese-American man, Vincent Chin, was shelved last year by the company A-Major Media after Chin’s family and an activist who was involved in the case said they had not been consulted (“I’m not dead yet and it’s weird hearing/seeing myself fictionalized by people who have never tried to connect with me or the Estate,” said the activist, Helen Zia, on Instagram, who was played by Star Wars actor Kelly Marie Tran in the podcast). Out of control? Much of the beauty of podcasting comes from the fact that it is an accessible medium – you or I could start a series in our living room and upload it to Spotify or Apple Podcasts to share with the world. And, perhaps, Big Podcasting’s blind spots are a hangover from its beginnings as a purely homespun form of media. Indeed, Rogan launched his podcast in 2009, at home, on his laptop. Similarly, another Spotify hit, Reply All, started out as a venture by friends Alex Goldman and PJ Vogt as part of a startup, Gimlet, which was later acquired by the company for $230m. That Reply All later ran into trouble – via a miniseries on racism at food website Bon Appetit, which led to accusations of racism at Gimlet itself – is no surprise when you consider its insular, unregulated start. Part of the appeal of Rogan and his ilk is that listeners feel as if they’re hanging out with a friend, albeit one who talks about cage fighting and the failings of the left more than most. Podcasts would be all the poorer if they didn’t bring in the quirks and foibles of their hosts, but – as this and other cases show – change is likely needed.

2/4/2022,"Gwion Ap Iago, half of the duo Roughion – sometimes billed as Wales’s answer to the Chemical Brothers – is in no doubt that this is “a moment” for Welsh language music. “A lot of people are learning Welsh, a lot of people are really wanting to support the Welsh language music scene and they’re realising what is pumping out there is really, really good,” he said. “We had that thing in the 90s – cool Cymru, Catatonia and all that. We are 100% living in a cool Cymru 2.0.”  Across the nation on Friday, venues, workplaces, schools were celebrating Dydd Miwsig Cymru (Welsh language music day), celebrating music from folk to rock, from indie to Roughion’s speciality: electronica. “We might automatically look at America, Germany and the Netherlands as countries producing the most recognised electronic music but the quality we have here shows that Wales is doing it too. Female artists like Gwenno and Kelly Lee Owens are leading the way.” Roughion’s songs include an atmospheric piece of electronica called Newport Road inspired by early hours returns to Cardiff after gigs, while their remix of a tune by the north Wales group Band Pres Llareggub (Llareggub Brass Band) has been played by DJs around the world. The seventh iteration of Welsh language music day was being seen as a particularly special, important and joyful one, with the Covid lockdowns having been both a challenge and an opportunity for the scene. Challenging because the Welsh government’s cautious approach to re-opening has led to long breaks for clubs and music venues. But the hiatus has also given musicians a chance to refine and develop their sound – and provided the time for more people to begin to learn Welsh. According to the language app Duolingo, Welsh is the most popular language to learn in the UK. The number of Welsh language pieces of music released via the Welsh label and distributor PYST increased from 357 in 2020 to 485 in 2021. It is now commonplace to hear Welsh language music on mainstream UK stations including BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 6 Music. The country’s reopening and the buildup to festival season is causing excitement. “People have got a lot of great songs ready to go, club ready,” said Ap Iago, who also runs a label, Afanc, named after a lake monster from Welsh mythology. A string of free gigs from Newport in the south-east to Caernarfon in the north-west were being held on Friday to mark Dydd Miwsig Cymru. Elan Evans, Welsh music promoter at the renowned Cardiff venue Clwb Ifor Bach, said there was an air of excitement. She said she loved seeing new artists “taking ownership” of the language. “Not just for home and school but to socialise in, live in, you can do whatever you want with it. It’s our language.” Huw Stephens, the BBC DJ and Dydd Miwsig Cymru ambassador, said: “There is a definite, carefree, creative moment in Welsh language music.” Stephens said following the lockdowns this spring and summer were going to be “critically important” for Welsh language music as people got out and about together. “What’s great is that it really is a year-round thing; it’s a live culture, a real culture, not a manufactured culture, it’s a very organic and natural scene.” Dydd Miwsig Cymru is part of the Welsh government’s long-term vision Cymraeg 2050 to see a million people speaking and using Welsh daily by the middle of the century. The minister for Welsh language and education, Jeremy Miles, said: “Mae’r iaith yn perthyn i ni gyd – the language belongs to us all. Gwenno and Gruff Rhys have shown that music in Welsh can travel the world and you don’t need to speak the language to enjoy Ani Glass and her electropop sound, or Candelas, who are formidable live. Dydd Miwsig Cymru celebrates all forms of Welsh language music, diverse scenes which are thriving and it’s about welcoming more people to dive in and discover what we have.”",Arts/Music,‘It’s 100% cool Cymru 2.0’: pumping it out on Welsh language music day,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/04/its-100-cool-cymru-20-pumping-it-out-on-welsh-language-music-day
2/4/2022,"It is, says James Blunt, the first night of his Greatest Hit tour. The crowd cheers. “That’s ‘hit’ singular,” he adds. “I’m going to play You’re Beautiful 22 times.” This is, of course, very on brand for James Blunt these days. His vast mid-00s success came with equally vast accompanying opprobrium – perhaps inevitable when an unnecessarily handsome Eton and Sandhurst alumnus shifts 11m copies of his ballad-heavy debut album, with sales driven by Radio 2. But Blunt has proved exceptionally adept at owning his role in popular culture. His witty, self-deprecating tweets are renowned. As Neil Young removed his music from Spotify, Blunt threatened to add more of his, for example, and similar stuff fills the gaps between songs tonight.  It’s at odds with the intensity of his performances – which occasionally extends to singing with fists clenched. But Blunt can afford to laugh at himself. One running gag involves his career tailing off since his debut album, Back to Bedlam, but its successors have shifted another nine million copies between them. On the evidence of tonight’s set, they have taken musical detours into areas just as uncool and reviled as Blunt once was, including Mumford & Sons-y pop-folk (Bonfire Heart) and ukulele-driven Ed Sheeran-isms (Postcards). Clearly he knows his audience. Some of it is as beige as detractors suggest but some is built robustly enough to cut through prejudices: Love Under Pressure’s house piano; Same Mistake’s Coldplay-ish stadium-rousing. His voice is an acquired taste – the cut-glass intonation occasionally suggests an impassioned love ballad being sung by the cad in a Boulting Brothers film – but it would be churlish to say that Monsters, about his ailing father, doesn’t pack an emotional punch, or that 1973, imbued with something of the Balearic spirit of Ibiza, where Blunt lives, isn’t really well-turned. Moreover, he appears to have attracted a new audience. Among the middle-aged couples lurk a noticeable contingent of early-twentysomethings, presumably fuelled by some combination of his online presence and memories of childhood car journeys soundtracked by Back to Bedlam. “You’re beautiful James!” cries one male voice; “I also love you, James!” answers another. They’re doing that thing where you pretend you’re at a gig ironically – but they’ve bought tickets and are singing along, raising the question of who the joke’s on. When Blunt dons a gas mask and runs into the crowd midway through an unexpected cover of Slade’s Coz I Luv You, one of them blocks his way, arms outstretched. Blunt literally leaps on to him, his legs wrapping around the fan’s waist, a man who fully understands on which side his bread is buttered.",Arts/Music,James Blunt review – larky king of uncool turns on the emotion,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/04/james-blunt-review-brighton-centre
2/4/2022,"BLTs – bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwiches – are one of the most popular choices in many supermarket meal deals. As a professional sandwicher of sorts, I look down the row of pre-packed sarnies in front of me with quite some glee. How fascinating to see how the real players of my industry go about their business.  There is only one piece of lettuce in this sandwich and it is already going grey. My friend Jack, with whom I shared these treats, says “a bit manky” might be a better description – but I couldn’t possibly comment. Many might argue that one piece of lettuce is ample – but not in a sandwich with lettuce in its name, surely? Overall the sandwich is very dry, as lacking in mayonnaise as lettuce, and the tomato is cut so thin even that old faithful can’t bring any moisture to the party. 4/10 Straight away, I can see mayonnaise. This is good. And the tomatoes are clearly thicker than in the first sandwich. There’s much more lettuce and the more plentiful mayo makes the whole experience juicier and more enjoyable. Unfortunately, the excessively smoky flavour of the bacon looms a little large over everything and is, quite frankly, a bit much. 5/10 Looks a bit mean on contents for what should be one of the posher versions. More grey lettuce is encountered. This is almost identical to the Co-op sandwich, with less smoky flavour and a little more tomato. 5/10 Wafer-thin bacon in abundance. Looks quite nice. Same lettuce as all the others but here there are (what appear to be, at least) grill marks on some of the bacon. How did they do that, we wonder? Feels as if the sandwich has a much lower salt content than the others and therefore less flavour, despite things initially looking quite promising. 5/10 This is the best looking of the bunch by miles but also the most expensive. Looks more like a BLT from a cafe than one from a supermarket. The bacon is palpably thicker and more peppery than the others. The tomato is much thicker. There are two varieties of lettuce in here and – about time – one would appear to be iceberg. Not too bad at all, relatively speaking. 6/10 People used to buy olive oil in a pharmacy, so why not get your lunch there now? The bread used for this one is particularly soft, and the volume of mayonnaise is verging on acceptable. There is a little more lettuce than most of the others. Unexpectedly, Boots have done all right here. 5/10  Max Halley is the owner of Max’s Sandwich Shop in Finsbury Park, north London, and the author of Max’s Sandwich Book and Max’s Picnic Book",Lifestyle/Food,The best BLT: an expert taste tests high street sandwiches,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/04/best-blt-sandwiches-ms-boots-co-op-waitrose-tesco
2/4/2022,"Today in a nutshell: All eyes turn to the Bird’s Nest stadium in Beijing for the opening ceremony after three days of sporting preliminaries. Next up: The Games start in earnest on Saturday with the first medals available, but China will be sensitive to the levels of global protest coinciding with the official opening of a controversial Games.  The stadium at the Winter Olympics is often criticised on cost and environmental grounds because it has been built specifically to hold the opening and closing ceremonies, and not much else. However, Beijing’s National Stadium doesn’t face that charge. Today it becomes the first stadium to host a Winter Olympics opening ceremony after having been built for the Summer Games. There have been suggestions that some athletes might boycott the ceremony in protest over China’s human rights record, but the US delegation say they are expecting around 80% of their contingent to attend, despite media reports to the contrary. There’s already been some sport. British interest has mostly been confined to the curling, where the mixed doubles pair of reigning world champions Jennifer Dodds and Bruce Mouat have won three of their opening four matches, following a tight game on Friday morning against Australia. Italy lead the round-robin stage so far, unbeaten after four matches. The Alpine skier Dave Ryding and curler Eve Muirhead have been chosen as Team GB’s flag-bearers for the opening ceremony. We’ve also had the opening skirmishes in the women’s ice hockey competition. Slightly oddly, every team in Group A (Canada, Switzerland, Finland, the US and the team from the Russian Olympic Committee) are already guaranteed a quarter-final slot, so these match-ups are just about jockeying for position and playing yourself into form. In Group B the Czech Republic, Japan, Denmark, Sweden and hosts China are scrapping for the remaining three berths. The main news so far though has been that the US assistant captain, Brianna Decker, suffered a sickening leg injury that will sideline her for the rest of the tournament. It didn’t stop the US demolishing Finland 5-2 as they opened their title defence. Elsewhere, the third round of training for women’s ski jumping was cancelled due to windy conditions, while Norway’s Aleksander Aamodt Kilde set the fastest time in the men’s downhill, with athletes concerned about the gusty conditions. Organisers say nine more athletes and officials tested positive for Covid in cases confirmed on Thursday. A strong performance by Nathan Chen in the short programme helped the US into the lead ahead of the Russian Olympic Committee and China in the team figure skating event after three rounds. Donald McRae interviewed skier Gus Kenworthy, who will compete for Team GB in his third and final Olympics as a gay man, an LGBTQ+ activist and an actor. He told Donald: “I’m just much happier now than I was back then when I wasn’t living my life authentically. I wasn’t being my true self and it definitely took a toll.” 10 things to look out for in Beijing by Sean Ingle and Bryan Armen Graham Spectre of 1936 and 1980 haunts Beijing as fear and repression breed silence The Georgian luger racing 12 years after his cousin’s death at Olympics Guardian US writers predict the victors at the Winter Olympics If you’re watching from Australia, here’s what you need to know Thursday saw qualification runs in the freestyle skiing for both the men’s and women’s moguls, and I suspect this is not the last picture of people on skis flying upside down through the air we will have in the newsletter.

2/4/2022,"It doesn’t take much imagination to realize that Amazon warehouse workers would benefit from having a union. The average Amazon warehouse worker leaves within just eight months – that’s an unmistakable sign that Amazon’s jobs are unpleasant, to put it kindly, and that many Amazon workers quickly realize they hate working there because of the stress, breakneck pace, constant monitoring and minimal rest breaks. Indeed, experts on the future of work often voice concern that Amazon’s vaunted algorithms and technologies treat Amazon’s warehouse workers like mindless, unfeeling robots – having them do the same thing hour after hour after hour. And then there are the endless tales from Amazon warehouse workers that the company is so stingy about break time that they often don’t have enough time to go back and forth to the bathroom without getting demerits for exceeding their allotted daily break time. It’s hard to believe that here in the 21st century, one of the nation’s biggest, most respected companies makes it so hard for many of its workers to pee.  In this way, working at Amazon resembles working at a poultry processing plant, where workers often wear adult diapers to work because their bosses frequently tell them they can’t take a break right now from cutting all those drumsticks and wings to go to the bathroom. Amazon workers continue to endure all this pain and strain even though Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and the world’s richest human being, has said he is committed to making Amazon “Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work”. Evidently Bezos fails to realize that any company whose workers leave after eight months on average is light years from being Earth’s Best Employer. As for being Earth’s Safest Place to Work, Bezos shouldn’t insult workers’ or the public’s intelligence by making such a claim, considering the rate of serious injuries at Amazon’s warehouses in 2020 was nearly twice that at other warehouses across the US. If Amazon were to be the Earth’s Best Employer, then its employees would probably be eager to work there until age 65 or 70, rather than say good riddance after a few months. By the way, the eight-month average that Amazon workers stay is a piddling one-sixth the average job tenure for America’s 155 million workers. However much Bezos detests unions, there’s one thing Bezos can’t honestly deny –unions would be a surefire way for Amazon to become a better employer. Indeed, if Bezos is serious about making Amazon Earth’s Best and Safest Employer, not only should Amazon stop fighting so hard to block unionization, as it has in Alabama, Staten Island and elsewhere, but it should roll out the red carpet for union organizers. If Amazon workers had a real voice at work, a real voice in shaping and improving Amazon’s working conditions – perhaps in de-stressing and slowing down Amazon’s the-algorithm-uber-alles work routines – Amazon might become a far better place to work, and perhaps take a few steps closer to Bezos’s much-ballyhooed goal of becoming Earth’s Best Employer. (I would settle for Amazon becoming Earth’s Best Warehouse Employer – Best Employer is a laudable goal, but a bridge way too far for Amazon.) If Amazon workers had an effective union that improves pay and conditions, they might stay for eight years on average instead of eight months. In that way, a union might go far to cure Amazon’s biggest headache: it chews through so many employees so fast that it is always desperate to hire new workers – more than 500,000 new hires some years (before quickly chewing through those new ones and spitting them out). Deep down, Amazon executives must be terrified that at some point, so many millions of Americans will have gone through and been chewed up by the Amazon push-it-to-the-max, stress machine, that Amazon simply won’t be able to find enough workers to keep all its warehouses operating – unless, perhaps, it raises its starting pay to $25 or $30 an hour. Some labor experts see an anti-union method to Amazon’s stress-o-matic madness: that it intentionally wants its workers to stay only a short time because its workers will then conclude that they won’t be there long enough to make it worthwhile to fight for a union. Besides, with such enormous employee turnover and with so many workers staying for such a short time, that makes it immensely hard for union organizers and union-supporting workers to explain to all of a warehouse’s workers how they would benefit from having a union. To say that unionizing Amazon is an uphill battle is an understatement. It’s one thing to unionize a Starbucks cafe with 30 baristas – and that’s quite hard, considering how aggressively anti-union Starbucks is. But it’s a whole different level of difficulty to unionize a warehouse with 5,000, especially when Amazon pumps out anti-union propaganda to its workers 24/7, while it prohibits union organizers from setting foot on company property. Making it even harder to unionize Amazon is the company’s apparent willingness to violate labor laws. Fed up with Amazon’s numerous alleged labor law violations at its warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, the National Labor Relations Board pressured Amazon into reaching a settlement in December in which the company promised to comply with federal laws that protect workers’ right to unionize. But just a month after that settlement, the NLRB again accused Amazon of serious labor law violations, this time at its Staten Island warehouse. In a complaint issued on 27 January, the NLRB said that one of Amazon top anti-union consultants, Bradley Moss, had called union organizers “thugs”, a word that some see as racially insensitive considering that most of the organizers in Staten Island are Black. The NLRB also said Moss had told workers it would be “futile” to vote for a union because a union would “never happen here”. The NLRB said Amazon committed other illegalities; confiscating pro-union literature, preventing workers from distributing flyers in break rooms and telling workers they couldn’t distribute union literature without Amazon’s permission. Amazon denies the NLRB’s allegations. While Amazon pushes its anti-union message to the max – remember the anti-union posters it put in its toilet stalls – Amazon seems averse to letting its employees utter a pro-union peep. Amazon has earned the dubious distinction of replacing Walmart as the nation’s fiercest anti-union employer. This week, more than 6,000 workers at Amazon’s warehouse in Bessemer are getting a second chance to vote on whether to have a union; the NLRB ordered a new election after asserting that Amazon’s illegalities prevented a fair, first union vote there. The bottom line here: not only would unionizing Amazon make it a better place to work – something Bezos says he badly wants – but a successful unionization vote at Amazon would be a huge, hopeful signal to embattled workers across the US that even at a fiercely anti-union corporation like Amazon, workers can indeed choose to have a union as a surefire way to improve their jobs and their lives.
