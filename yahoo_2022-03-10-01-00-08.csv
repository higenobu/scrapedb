3/10/2022,"The first person to receive a heart transplant from a pig has died, two months after the groundbreaking experiment, the Maryland hospital that performed the surgery announced Wednesday. David Bennett, 57, died Tuesday at the University of Maryland Medical Center. Doctors didn’t give an exact cause of death, saying only that his condition had begun deteriorating several days earlier. Bennett's son praised the hospital for offering the last-ditch experiment, saying the family hoped it would help further efforts to end the organ shortage. “We are grateful for every innovative moment, every crazy dream, every sleepless night that went into this historic effort,” David Bennett Jr. said in a statement released by the University of Maryland School of Medicine. “We hope this story can be the beginning of hope and not the end.” Doctors for decades have sought to one day use animal organs for life-saving transplants. Bennett, a handyman from Hagerstown, Maryland, was a candidate for this newest attempt only because he otherwise faced certain death — ineligible for a human heart transplant, bedridden and on life support, and out of other options. After the Jan. 7 operation, Bennett's son told The Associated Press his father knew there was no guarantee it would work. Prior attempts at such transplants -- or xenotransplantation -- have failed largely because patients’ bodies rapidly rejected the animal organ. This time, the Maryland surgeons used a heart from a gene-edited pig: Scientists had modified the animal to remove pig genes that trigger the hyper-fast rejection and add human genes to help the body accept the organ. At first the pig heart was functioning, and the Maryland hospital issued periodic updates that Bennett seemed to be slowly recovering. Last month, the hospital released video of him watching the Super Bowl from his hospital bed while working with his physical therapist. Bennett survived significantly longer with the gene-edited pig heart than one of the last milestones in xenotransplantation -- when Baby Fae, a dying California infant, lived 21 days with a baboon's heart in 1984. “We are devastated by the loss of Mr. Bennett. He proved to be a brave and noble patient who fought all the way to the end,” Dr. Bartley Griffith, who performed the surgery at the Baltimore hospital, said in a statement. The need for another source of organs is huge. More than 41,000 transplants were performed in the U.S. last year, a record -- including about 3,800 heart transplants. But more than 106,000 people remain on the national waiting list, thousands die every year before getting an organ and thousands more never even get added to the list, considered too much of a long shot. The Food and Drug Administration had allowed the dramatic Maryland experiment under “compassionate use” rules for emergency situations. Bennett’s doctors said he had heart failure and an irregular heartbeat, plus a history of not complying with medical instructions. He was deemed ineligible for a human heart transplant that requires strict use of immune-suppressing medicines, or the remaining alternative, an implanted heart pump. Doctors didn't reveal the exact cause of Bennett's death. Rejection, infection and other complications are risks for transplant recipients. But from Bennett's experience, ""we have gained invaluable insights learning that the genetically modified pig heart can function well within the human body while the immune system is adequately suppressed,” said Dr. Muhammad Mohiuddin, scientific director of the Maryland university’s animal-to-human transplant program. One next question is whether scientists have learned enough from Bennett's experience and some other recent experiments with gene-edited pig organs to persuade the FDA to allow a clinical trial — possibly with an organ such as a kidney that isn’t immediately fatal if it fails. Twice last fall, surgeons at New York University got permission from the families of deceased individuals to temporarily attach a gene-edited pig kidney to blood vessels outside the body and watch them work before ending life support. And surgeons at the University of Alabama at Birmingham went a step further, transplanting a pair of gene-edited pig kidneys into a brain-dead man in a step-by-step rehearsal for an operation they hope to try in living patients possibly later this year. Pigs have long been used in human medicine, including pig skin grafts and implantation of pig heart valves. But transplanting entire organs is much more complex than using highly processed tissue. The gene-edited pigs used in these experiments were provided by Revivicor, a subsidiary of United Therapeutics, one of several biotech companies in the running to develop suitable pig organs for potential human transplant. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

""Time to let the American broomstick fly and hear the sounds of freedom,"" SpaceX launch engineer Julia Black called out just before the 8:45 a.m. EST liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. ""Launch director is go for launch."" The rocket successfully launched 48 Starlink internet satellites to orbit, then returned to land on the Just Read the Instructions drone ship a few minutes later. It marked the booster's fourth flight to date. The broomstick comments came after Dmitry Rogozin, head of Russia's space corporation Roscosmos, continued to assault U.S. space operations and companies on social media and in interviews. ""In a situation like this we can't supply the United States with our world's best rocket engines. Let them fly on something else like their broomsticks, I don't know what,"" Rogozin said on Russian television last week. More: OneWeb suspends launches as Russia increases demands on space internet provider More: Here's where U.S. and Russia overlap on space programs and hardware Some American-made rockets like United Launch Alliance's Atlas V do use Russian RD-180 main engines, but others, like SpaceX's Falcon 9, fly on domestic propulsion. Rogozin's latest comments built on similar statements he made in 2014. When the U.S. announced sanctions after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine, Rogozin famously said NASA astronauts could launch to the ISS on trampolines since there was no American-made vehicle capable of doing the job; the space shuttle had retired three years earlier. But since 2020, SpaceX has launched for crewed missions to the International Space Station, leading founder Elon Musk to make comments like: ""The trampoline is working!"" The Space Coast's next launch, meanwhile, will see a team of four private passengers fly to the International Space Station in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule. The liftoff from Kennedy Space Center's pad 39A is targeted for 2:36 p.m. EST Wednesday, March 30. For the latest, visit floridatoday.com/launchschedule.

3/10/2022,"Donald Trump both admired and feared Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to former Trump White House communications director Stephanie Grisham. “Honestly, I think he feared him. I think he was afraid of him. I think the man intimidated him,” Grisham said on Tuesday’s broadcast of “The View.” “I also think he admired him greatly. I think he wanted to be able to kill whoever spoke out against him,” she continued, adding Trump “loved the dictators” and “the people who could kill anyone, including the press.” Grisham, now working to prevent Trump from taking office again in 2024, also suggested how her former boss would have responded had America been invaded as Ukraine has been by Russia. “Donald Trump would be 57 feet below ground hiding,” she said, praising Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for being “out there fighting for his country, and I just think that’s great.” And were he still president, Trump would have had a “completely hands-off approach” to Putin’s military aggression, she said.

Avdeeva, who described the sights she had witnessed, said there was no water or electricity supply to the residential area in the vicinity.
