4/30/2022,"The parents of Gabby Petito have amended their lawsuit against the parents of her admitted killer, fiancé Brian Laundrie, that alleges he and his family went on vacation together while knowing the location of Petito's body. The amended suit leads with the allegation that the three traveled to a Florida nature attraction, Fort De Soto Park near Tampa, a few days before Gabby Petito was reported missing in a case that triggered a massive search for the woman and questions about her wellbeing from her mother and father. ""They went on vacation knowing that Brian Laundrie had murdered Gabrielle Petito, it is believed that they knew where her body was located, and further knew that Gabrielle Petito's parents were attempting to locate her,"" the amended lawsuit said. Earlier this year, the Florida district court judge in the case told plaintiffs Joseph Petito and Nichole Schmidt, the victim's father and mother, that their initial filing against the Laundries had ""procedural deficiency"" and must be amended to proceed. Such revisions are not unusual in civil court. The Laundries tried to have the suit dismissed. “The allegations in the amended complaint may now conform to proper pleadings but they do not give rise to liability under the law,"" Laundrie family attorney Steven Bertolino told NBC News by email on Friday. ""Thus we are still confident the Court will dismiss the action."" Christopher Laundrie and Roberta Laundrie have consistently denied they knew Gabby Petito was dead, where her remains might have been or that they helped Brian Laundrie flee as he was sought as a person of interest. The amended suit offered little support for the vacation claim, although there is time to submit evidence. A jury trial is scheduled to start the week of Aug. 14, 2023, in Sarasota County, Florida. In March, Bertolino called the underlying allegations in the initial lawsuit, which mostly remained intact Friday, ""baseless"" and “frivolous."" The latest filing says Laundrie, in an attempt to conceal the death of Petito, allegedly sent a text on her phone that uses a name for the victim's grandfather that she never used. Because of this attempt to hide Petito's death, the suit argues, it can be assumed he told his parents she was dead and where he placed the remains. The text was sent to Schmidt on Aug. 27, according to the amended complaint. It says the text referred to Petito's grandfather by his first name, Stan. According to an NBC News timeline, Petito's body was found on Sept. 19, 2021 in Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming, in an area where the couple had been traveling. Laundrie’s body was found Oct. 20, 2021, in a nature preserve not far from his Florida home. A Florida medical examiner said he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The couple set off on July 2, 2021 from New York on a cross-country tour of national parks, documenting their journey on YouTube and Instagram using the hashtag #VanLife. Her family has said Petito was last heard from in late August, when she was believed to be in Grand Teton National Park near Jackson, Wyoming, which is next to Bridger-Teton National Forest. Schmidt said the last text sent by Petito was on Aug. 24, and that subsequent texts from her phone were suspect in origin. The suit says Laundrie murdered her Aug. 27 by striking her on the head and neck with an unknown instrument and strangling her. Brian Laundrie is believed to have flown home to Tampa from Salt Lake City, Utah, on Sept. 1 after one previous return to Florida in August. Petito was reported missing Sept. 11. The suit says Brian Laundrie told his parents what he did and where he left the victim's remains, but that — instead of telling the woman's parents — they blocked calls and social media queries Petito's family and then chose to go on a trip to Florida's Fort De Soto Park Sept. 6 and 7 of 2021. The alleged vacation, in light of a statement that month in which the pair expressed ""hope"" the search for Petito was fruitful, caused or exacerbated her family's pain and suffering, mental anguish, inconvenience, and ""loss of capacity for enjoyment of life,"" the suit claims. A dollar amount for the filing has not been revealed, but the amended claim says damages sought will exceed $30,000.",U.S./NBC News,Gabby Petito parents says Laundrie family went on vacation while knowing her body's location,https://news.yahoo.com/gabby-petito-parents-says-laundrie-230104715.html
4/30/2022,"The United Methodist Church’s Council of Bishops, ending a five-day meeting Friday, acknowledged the inevitable breakup of their denomination – a schism that will widen this weekend with the launch of a global movement led by theologically conservative Methodists. The breakaway denomination, called the Global Methodist Church, will officially exist as of Sunday. Its leaders have been exasperated by liberal churches’ continued defiance of UMC bans on same-sex marriage and the ordination of openly gay clergy. Bishop Thomas Bickerton, who became the Council of Bishops’ new president Friday, described the launch of the new movement as a “sad and sobering reality.” Bickerton said he regrets any departure from the UMC and values the denomination’s diversity of thought. “There is no perfect church,” he said. “The constant fighting, the vitriolic rhetoric, the punitive behaviors have no place in how we preserve and promote our witness as Christian believers.” He said he prays the infighting will stop and the UMC will rediscover its mission to make disciples for Christ. He urged the UMC, even as it suffers defections, to think of May 1 as its launch day as well. “We are the United Methodist Church not interested in continuing sexism, racism, homophobia, irrelevancy and decline,” he said. “What we are interested in is a discovery of what God has in mind for us on the horizon as the next expression of who we are as United Methodists.” Bickerton, who heads the UMC’s New York City region, succeeded Louisiana-based Cynthia Fierro Harvey as president of the bishops’ council. Harvey acknowledged the inevitable splintering of the denomination when she preached April 25 during her final address as the Council of Bishops president, “I also realize that it might be time to bless and send our sisters and brothers who cannot remain under the big tent.” A leader of the breakaway movement indicated Sunday’s launch would take place with little fanfare. “This is the date that we can start receiving churches as they leave the United Methodist Church, and that’s going to occur over a considerable amount of time,” said the Rev. Keith Boyette, chairman of the new denomination’s Transitional Leadership Council and a United Methodist minister in Virginia. “It’ll be more of a rolling celebration.” Its transitional doctrine includes a belief that marriage is between one man and one woman, and clergy must adhere to it – a core point of division in the UMC for decades. Boyette said he expects some churches and pastors to announce Sunday they are joining the Global Methodist Church. He will be among them. “On May 1, I will no longer be a member of the United Methodist Church,” said Boyette, who has already been approved – effective Sunday -- as a clergyperson in the new denomination. It is easier for clergy to leave the UMC than an entire church, which has to follow a layered process. As a result, Boyette expects the ranks of the Global Methodist Church will grow over time, noting that some who want to join will wait until after the UMC's 2024 General Conference – and the possible passage of a protocol that spells out details for the breakup. Boyette criticized the actions of some members of the Council of Bishops, including the decision to further delay the General Conference. He suggested some bishops are intentionally blocking churches from using certain processes for exiting the denomination. Global Methodist Church organizers had originally expected to launch the denomination only after the next General Conference of the UMC. That legislative body is the only one that could approve a tentative agreement — unveiled in 2020 after negotiations between conservatives, liberals and centrists — to allow churches and regional groups to leave the denomination and keep their property. But the General Conference, originally scheduled for 2020, was already delayed for two straight years by the pandemic. In March, the UMC announced it was pushing off the next gathering yet again — to 2024 — due to long delays in the U.S. processing of visa applications. A little more than half of the denomination’s members are overseas, notably in Africa and the Philippines. The United Methodist Church claims 6.3 million members in the U.S. and 6.5 million overseas. Differences over same-sex marriage and the ordination of LGBTQ clergy have simmered for years in the UMC, and came to a head in 2019 at a conference in St. Louis where delegates voted 438-384 to strengthen bans on LGBTQ-inclusive practices. Most U.S.-based delegates opposed that plan and favored LGBTQ-friendly options; they were outvoted by U.S. conservatives teamed with most of the delegates from Methodist strongholds in Africa and the Philippines. In the aftermath of that meeting, many moderate and liberal clergy made clear they would not abide by the bans, and various groups worked on proposals to let the UMC split along theological lines. ___ Associated Press writer Giovanna Dell'Orto contributed to this report. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

4/30/2022,"A ""fictosexual"" Japanese man who married a hologram in 2018 recently told a Japanese newspaper that their relationship is struggling with communication. Akihiko Kondo, 38, who works at a middle school in a Tokyo suburb, married Hatsune Miku, a hologram that was created by a computer as singing software, on Nov. 4, 2018, in a wedding that cost more than $17,000. As one of the thousands of ""fictosexuals,"" Kondo is attracted to fictional characters. Kondo first interacted with Miku using Gatebox, a $1,300 device that projected fictional characters into a cylinder and allowed users to communicate via artificial intelligence and marry them unofficially. When he proposed to her in the cylinder, Miku reportedly replied, ""I hope you'll cherish me."" MAN, 35, REPORTEDLY MARRIES COMPUTER HOLOGRAM Since their marriage in 2018, Gatebox technology no longer exists, which Kondo said has complicated their relationship, but not lessened his feelings. ""My love for Miku hasn’t changed,"" he told Japanese paper Mainichi, which recounted how he walks around with a life-size version of the doll. ""I held the wedding ceremony because I thought I could be with her forever."" Remembering what caused him to withdraw into a world where he would marry a fictitious character, Kondo told Newshub, ""It's not that people can't live in society because they're engrossed in a two-dimensional world, but rather, there are cases where people become captivated as they search for a place for themselves in video games and anime because reality is too painful for them."" ""I was one of those people. People who don't understand the background probably think, 'Games are disrupting their lives,' but that's not the case,"" he added. Kondo was reportedly bullied at work and fell into a depression in 2008 when he first stumbled upon Miku and realized human relationships weren't for him. He credits the Vocaloid software voicebank with pulling him out of his depression. ""I stayed in my room for 24 hours a day, and watched videos of Miku the whole time,"" he recalled to Mainichi.
