4/9/2022,"Asda is under pressure to raise pay for its shop floor workers after wage increases at Tesco and Sainsbury’s this week left the Leeds-based chain as the UK’s lowest paying supermarket. The UK’s third largest supermarket chain pays workers a minimum of £9.66 an hour, or £10.83 in London, making it the only big chain to pay less than the independently verified living wage of £11.05 in the capital and £9.90 elsewhere. More than half Asda’s shop floor workers have had to borrow cash from friends and relatives in the past year; 8% have used a food bank and more than one in 10 (12%) have used a payday lender, according to a survey of 2,000 of the supermarket’s workers by the GMB union. Nadine Houghton, the union’s national officer, said: “Asda needs to get a grip. It is now the lowest paying of the big four supermarkets and one of the lowest paying supermarkets overall. There is a cost-of-living crisis and for many Asda workers, covering basic bills is a struggle.” Asda said it had increased its pay to £9.66 an hour this month, just above the new £9.50 legal minimum for those aged 23 and over, and was one of only two supermarkets that continued to pay store staff a bonus, which was an average £413, in effect lifting hourly pay to £9.88. Workers are also in line for a pay rise in year to an hourly rate of £10.06. A spokesperson said: “We pay our store colleagues a competitive hourly rate benchmarked against the retail sector and our pay rate will increase by 7.35% over the next two years. Unlike most competitors, we also pay all store colleagues a bonus.” Asda has been left behind as retailers have been forced to push through significant pay increases to counter high inflation and competition for suitable staff. Industry insiders said there was a battle to hold on to experienced staff, as well as to attract new workers, given the expense of recruitment and training. A combination of Brexit and the pandemic has increased competition for workers, as many Europeans went home in the past two years and either can not, or do not, wish to return to the UK. The pressure on Asda increased after Sainsbury’s confirmed it was raising pay for workers in its supermarkets and Argos stores in outer London by 55p an hour to the London living wage of £11.05. The improvement makes it the first supermarket group to pay all its workers above the independently verified living wage after pressure from investors. Sainsbury’s staff in inner London already receive £11.05 an hour after a pay rise last month, while those outside the capital receive at least £10 an hour. That pay rise came after Tesco, previously the UK’s lowest-paying supermarket, announced on Thursday that it was investing £200m to increase its rate of pay by 5.8% to a minimum £10.10 from 24 July 2022, the biggest single-year investment in hourly pay for shop and warehouse workers at the UK’s largest supermarket chain in at least a decade. Under the deal agreed with the Usdaw union, some shopping delivery drivers, currently paid £9.55 an hour, will receive an extra 90p an hour from 1 May, taking their hourly rate to £11 from 24 July 2022. The latest pay rise at Tesco comes only seven months after it increased wages for its lowest-paid workers by 2.7% to £9.55 an hour. Tesco has now leapfrogged Aldi to join Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Aldi and Lidl in offering at least £10 an hour.",News/Business,Asda under pressure after pay rise lags behind Tesco and Sainsbury’s ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/08/asda-under-pressure-after-pay-rise-lags-behind-tesco-and-sainsburys
4/9/2022,"Jimmy Kimmel found himself embroiled in a “brouhaha” on Thursday, after Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican representative from Florida, called the Capitol police on the comedian. At issue was a joke Kimmel made about how Greene, whom Kimmel calls “Klan mom,” had called the three GOP senators who supported Ketanji Brown Jackson’s supreme court nomination “pro-pedophile”. Kimmel joked: “where is Will Smith when you need him?” Greene “decided she was going to get some political mileage out of this,” Kimmel said. “This is what she does instead of working. She tweets.” Greene tweeted at ABC that “this threat of violence against me by @jimmykimmel” had been filed with the Capitol police. “She called the police and reported this!” Kimmel marveled. “Not only did she call the police, she called the same police she voted against giving a congressional gold medal to for defending our Capitol against the insurrection she helped incite on January 6th. That’s who she called: the people she wanted to defund. “It’s amazing how quickly you can go from ‘these liberals who can’t say anything any more’ to ‘what’d you say? I’m calling the cops!’” Kimmel continued. “It must be that cancel culture they’re always talking about.” In a separate tweet, Greene called Kimmel’s joke a “dog whistle to the violent left to assault me or worse” and asked “how many new death threats will I get that are your fans?” Kimmel responded: “Not only don’t I condone death or any kind of threats against anyone, especially since I get dozens of them a week myself from the sickos who align with you, I also find it very rich that a person who did this in her campaign ad” – shooting a semi-automatic gun – “is whining about fantasies of violence.” Moreover, Greene has endorsed fringe conspiracy theories and repeatedly expressed support for executing prominent Democratic politicians. “Now she’s dialing 911 because she got made fun of,” said Kimmel. “She’s a snowflake and a sociopath at the same time.” On Late Night, Seth Meyers recapped a House vote to hold Trump aides Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino in criminal contempt of Congress. They join two other former Trump White House officials held in criminal contempt, Steve Bannon and former chief of staff Mark Meadows. (Bannon has been indicted and is awaiting trial.) “At this point, it’s easier to list the Trump aides who aren’t in legal trouble,” said Meyers. The vote was not without disruption; Representative Greene, AKA “the are you for fucking real housewife of DC”, heckled congressman Jamie Raskin as he was speaking, “like a drunk aunt at a comedy show who thinks everyone’s there to see her”, Meyers said. And House minority leader Kevin McCarthy “threw a fit” because he thought no one was listening to him. “Buddy, if people are standing and talking you can’t bitch about it, you’ve got to grow a spine and plow right through,” Meyers said. McCarthy and Trump are similar in that both are “dangerous and pathetic at the same time, which is true of so much of the GOP these days,” Meyers said. “It’s honestly bewildering. Trump’s like one of those cats who gets stuck on a Roomba but then if you go near it he’ll hiss and claw your eyes out.” And on the Late Show, Stephen Colbert celebrated the Senate’s confirmation of judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, making her the first black female justice ever to serve on the supreme court. After the vote, Biden hugged Jackson in an emotional moment. “It was reminiscent of when Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed and the former president helped him do a keg stand,” Colbert joked. Colbert also discussed the Covid outbreak among the political class in Washington DC. At least 14 guests at Saturday’s Gridiron Club dinner have tested positive for the virus, including the communications director for Vice-President Kamala Harris, Representatives Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Joaquin Castro (D-TX) and attorney general Merrick Garland. “OK, that proves that Mitch McConnell is worse than a disease, because at least Covid was willing to meet with Merrick Garland,” Colbert joked. And the UN general assembly voted to suspend Russia’s membership on the UN human rights council. “That sounds right,” said Colbert. “You know what sounds wrong? Russia was on the human rights council.” Pope Francis, of all people, also expressed dissatisfaction with the UN. “In the ongoing war in Ukraine, we witness the impotence of the International Organizations of the United Nations,” he said in a statement. “It’s never a good sign when the celibate guy calls you impotent,” said Colbert. “Or when the Catholic church says ‘you guys are moving too slowly.’",Arts/Culture,Jimmy Kimmel on Marjorie Taylor Greene: ‘A snowflake and a sociopath at the same time’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/08/jimmy-kimmel-marjorie-taylor-greene-late-night

4/9/2022,"There has been an uneasy consensus among Conservative MPs that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has meant Boris Johnson is saved from a leadership challenge. But there is also a whispered agreement that there is another factor keeping Johnson in No 10 – the fast disintegration of Rishi Sunak’s reputation as a viable alternative. Tory MPs who spoke to the Guardian said they believed his chances of becoming prime minister were now minimal. “His stock has fallen considerably. I don’t think that he is a contender now. I’m not sure he ever really was,” one key Johnson critic said. Some Tories are prepared to robustly defend the chancellor over the revelations that his wife, Akshata Murty, has non-domiciled tax status, which makes it unclear what tax – if any – she has paid on £11.5m in annual dividends from a stake in her family’s IT business empire, Infosys. One said it was “deeply pathetic” to go after family members. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, and Johnson himself defended Murty on the airwaves. However, the chancellor’s relationship with No 10 is fractured, despite Johnson being more supportive in public over the tax furore than Sunak was over the prime minister’s Partygate scandal. And those tensions erupted on Thursday night as an ally of Sunak accused those around Johnson of being responsible for the leak of Murty’s tax status – something No 10 and No 11 deny on the record. Privately, MPs concede that the revelations could be damaging. But they also point to instances such as his photo opportunity with a Kia Rio, his quip that his household “all have different breads” and his £100,000 donation to Winchester college as more cringeworthy. Sunak, with his slick PR operation, was the consensus choice when Partygate put Johnson’s future in the balance, though even then many MPs remained unable to say exactly who were the core Sunak squad among the parliamentary party. YouGov polling shows the chancellor’s popularity has fallen by 24 points since the spring statement. Now he is less popular than Johnson and Keir Starmer.. Labour, which saw the chancellor’s popularity as a threat to its hopes of getting ahead in polls on economic competence, has expended huge effort to try to taint him. Starmer has used tax increases multiple times, even during Partygate, as his attack lines of choice at prime minister’s questions. Since the spring statement, Labour has redoubled its efforts with a series of stunts, including hand-delivering mock letters about tax increases to political journalists with “signed by Rishi” branding that has been on the chancellor’s own publicity. Activists posed with Sunak masks outside the Treasury holding tax bills getting gradually larger. Sunak has plummeted in the closely watched ConservativeHome polls of cabinet ministers. The poll had been in part responsible for Liz Truss’ growing reputation as the members’ darling, as she routinely topped it, though more rigorous polling of members revealed in February that Sunak would have beaten her comfortably. Now it is the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, riding high. Conservative MPs point to Sunak’s growing reputation as a tax raiser because of a failure to cancel this week’s national insurance hike, despite the promise of a future income tax cut. “The world changed radically from the time when it was announced – rising prices, Ukraine, the pressures people are under are just so awful at the moment,” one former minister said. “He can’t control global fuel prices but he can control the tax system.” The second issue is a failure of the spring statement to deliver more help with the cost of living. Sunak has been blamed across Whitehall for blocking a multitude of measures to ease the crisis. Whitehall sources confirmed Sunak had taken his red marker to a number of spending plans in the long-delayed energy security strategy released on Thursday. He is said to have vetoed proposals to increase the energy rebate, which officials had proposed raising to at least £500, either for all households or for the poorest homes. Sunak also rejected an earlier offer in the strategy to expand funding for energy efficiency measures in people’s homes. According to the Telegraph, the Treasury said it would not fund the extra £200m to expand the scheme, which uses money raised from green levies to pay for improvements such as insulation for the worse-off. MPs, even those from the David Cameron era of austerity, said they did not believe such tight pursestrings was a viable political position. “Look, my politics are basically Rishi’s – small state. I do think it’s right we make the point that government cannot shield people from everything,” one frontbencher said. “But I accept that is not where the public is now. I’m not sure we’re really in a position to say no compromise with the electorate.” The third issue raised by most MPs, potentially most damaging, is an emerging sense Sunak has been politically naive in making what appeared to be an obvious play for the leadership and in a catalogue of missteps about his family’s wealth. In focus groups run by Labour, sources say it is striking how quickly the chancellor has become a subject of ridicule, having previously been widely praised. Most likely to prompt laughter is the picture of Sunak filling up someone else’s car in Sainsbury’s on the day he cut fuel duty. “It’s not that people don’t like him because he’s rich, that’s not the issue, it’s the inauthenticity,” one insider said. “The truth of the matter is that he’s been getting overexcited,” one former cabinet minister said. “Every week he was sending out the email equivalent of a glossy newsletter with his Rishi signature on it. It’s trying too hard. “When Boris was at his lowest ebb, Rishi emailed all MPs to say ‘come and meet me and tell me your ideas’, with invites for that very night and the next day, and that’s just unheard of – it looks so opportunistic. And it looks naive, I think that is actually what it is.” One backbencher said they feared the party would not benefit even from more popular measures such as the fuel duty cut or the income tax cut announced in the spring statement for 2024. “Of course, that’s politically naive as well. It just underlines the inexperience because people will have discounted it by the time it comes in – they’ll think: so what?” the MP said. “What people are actually going to think when they hear that is ‘I don’t need a tax cut in two years’ time. I need it today.’” Not everyone is ready to write off the chancellor. “I’ve been around a long time and I think we do this too quickly,” one frontbencher said. “His public reputation was never going to last because as a chancellor you have to make very hard choices. It’s actually not your job to be popular.”",News/Politics,‘It’s the inauthenticity’: has Rishi Sunak blown his No 10 chance?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/08/has-rishi-sunak-blown-chance-tory-leader
4/9/2022,"All the best rugby teams are striving for the same things. An identity. A tight-knit culture. An environment in which words, eventually, are superfluous. Where what really matters is not individual ability but the unbreakable bond of togetherness. And where, after a while, winning becomes so natural it feels almost preordained. Until, that is, the magic dries up. Star players retire or get injured, coaches come and go, supporters grow restless. Worse still, the arch rivals up the road are flying. History, all of a sudden, counts for little. Which is roughly where Munster, once the European Cup’s ultimate feelgood story and guardians of what used to be the continent’s most fabled culture, currently find themselves. Ahead of their two-legged Champions Cup last-16 collision with Exeter Chiefs, the mind spools back to the great Paul O’Connell’s description of the Munster dressing-room in his aptly-titled autobiography, The Battle. “It was like having the craic in the pub with eight pints on board, except you’re stone cold sober. If a guy broke up with his girlfriend and was really cut up about it, we’d play ‘It’ll be Lonely this Christmas’ at full volume in the gym. When Marcus Horan found out he had a heart condition … we decided he needed to hear Feargal Sharkey singing ‘A good heart these days is hard to find.’” And so on. Towards the end of O’Connell’s playing career, the running “joke” was that he was visiting a local hospice each day after training to familiarise himself with the place. Brutal did not begin to cover it, which was one of the reasons why Munster were so relentlessly tough in adversity on the field. And now? The “Brave and the Faithful” who followed their local heroes everywhere in the halcyon days are having their faith severely tested. It is more than a decade since the men in red last won any silverware, since when Leinster have accelerated away over the horizon as Ireland’s most irresistible force. Last weekend, in the keynote fixture of their United Rugby Championship campaign, Munster’s blue-shirted nemesis cruised down to Limerick with some big name starters missing and still won 34-19. There were empty seats at Thomond Park, not all of which could be blamed on Covid-19 or the late kick-off. Injuries are also stacking up, with key men such as Peter O’Mahony, Tadhg Beirne, Joey Carbery, Dave Kilcoyne and Gavin Coombes all unavailable to play this weekend. Worst of all, there is still a vacuum where the clear-sighted plan for next season - and beyond - should be. Leicester will be able to call upon the experience of George Ford and Dan Cole as they seek to spearhead a productive fortnight for English teams in the last 16 of this season’s Heineken Champions Cup. Both Tigers and Harlequins face tricky first-leg assignments in France but are hopeful of more success than the national team enjoyed in Paris last month. Ford is back at fly-half against Clermont Auvergne after injuring an ankle against Exeter while Cole, who has been out for almost two months, is on the bench for the first instalment of Sunday’s heavy-duty double header. Another capped England forward, Ollie Chessum, is on the bench but the home side will be lacking France’s prolific winger Damian Penaud at the Stade Marcel Michelin. Quins are braced for a major contrast in styles when they go to Montpellier, with the senior coach Tabai Matson eagerly awaiting the clash with the current French Top 14 leaders. “Montpellier have kicked the ball 50 times more than any other Top 14 team and clearly we want to run the ball an awful lot,” said Matson. “This is what Europe is all about: facing teams who play differently to the way we want to play.” The only change to the Quins starting XV involves the return of Louis Lynagh on the wing. Exeter’s Rob Baxter is also urging his side to seize the moment when they welcome an injury-plagued Munster to Sandy Park. The Chiefs are also still missing a clutch of internationals in Jack Nowell, Luke Cowan-Dickie and Jonny Hill but Sam Simmonds and Henry Slade are both back and Baxter is hoping his players will rise to the two-leg challenge. “I want to us to get excited about being in the Heineken Cup and make it a big night for the club, the players and for the supporters,” said the director of rugby, “We have patches in games where we are as good as anyone in the league but then at other times we seem to just drop off.” The all-English tie between Sale and Bristol is another intriguing match-up, with Bristol’s Semi Radradra and Charles Piutau both only on the bench as Pat Lam makes 10 changes in the wake of last week’s 39-22 defeat to Northampton. Nathan Hughes, recently on loan at Bath, returns at No 8 while Steven Luatua returns on the bench after dislocating a wrist against Harlequins last month. Munster’s South African head coach Johann van Graan is off to Bath at the end of the season, as is his defence coach JP Ferreira. The club’s senior coach, the ex-Wallaby fly-half Stephen Larkham, is also departing along with the Springbok World Cup winner Damian de Allende. Even the ever-loyal O’Mahony pointedly observed this week that the delay in naming Van Graan’s replacement was “not ideal” from a playing perspective. The popular Graham Rowntree, currently coaching the forwards, has applied for the role but nothing is yet confirmed. For those who live and breathe Munster it is all increasingly frustrating. “There’s a lot of discontent here with the way the province is being run,” says Donal Lenihan, the highly respected ex-Munster and Ireland captain who is now serving as president of Cork Constitution. Lenihan even uses the word “delusional” in relation to the current organisation. “It drives me bananas,” he tells the Guardian, urging Munster’s senior officials to get real and make significant structural changes if they wish to move forward. “Munster think they’re Leinster, that’s their biggest bloody problem. I chuckle a bit when we travel to France and England. It’s like Manchester United in many ways. They’re seen as being these giants but they’re not.” There are also distant echoes of Bath and Leicester, two English sides who have spent the past decade chasing former glories. Even the now-resurgent Tigers finally had to accept that their time-honoured methods needed updating. Munster’s issues, though, are arguably more deep-seated. Big lads in Limerick, who would have gravitated to rugby 10-15 years ago, are now choosing hurling instead and the province is struggling to compete with the population advantages, private school nurseries and well-organised feeder systems that Leinster are now harnessing. In Lenihan’s opinion - “They’re in a different class off the field as well as on it and that’s coming home to roost” - there is no point in denying the existence of a gulf. Munster, he believes, need to front up to the challenge, install a more long-term focused director of rugby and re-engage more proactively with their local clubs. Embracing a more upbeat playing style would also help. Another former Munster legend, Keith Wood, recently dismissed their limited gameplan as “turgid nonsense” and some Cork-based fans are opting against making the three-hour round trip to Limerick. It is hardly an endorsement of the tactical and selectorial instincts of Van Graan, who took over from Rassie Erasmus in 2017. “I think the thing that’s annoying people most in Munster is that they’ve got a decent squad of players,” says Lenihan. “From a coaching perspective they should be getting more out of what they have. We’re not going to win the Heineken Cup this year and we won’t win the URC either. They should be investing in the younger lads.” With so much angst swirling around, it does not feel entirely coincidental that Ronan O’Gara and Jerry Flannery, two upwardly-mobile coaches reared in Munster’s unforgiving crucible, have conspicuously chosen to stay put at La Rochelle and Harlequins respectively. There is also a financial aspect to consider. With the rebuilt Thomond Park and the pandemic having already emptied Munster’s coffers, lobbing huge sums at the world’s best coaches is no longer part of the equation. If the right catalyst can be identified, Lenihan still believes a rousing revival is possible. “I think the culture is still there but it’s dormant. It won’t take much to reignite it.” Maybe, but finishing second over two legs to opponents who have endured a mixed Premiership season would scarcely dilute the sense of a proud province treading water. It makes the next two Saturdays significant on several fronts. Stand Up And Fight?

4/9/2022,"News bulletins announce forest fires in northern France, Google shutting down its servers, martial law declared. Water levels are rising: seek higher ground. Climate catastrophe is the backdrop for Akram Khan’s cautionary reimagining of Rudyard Kipling’s Jungle Book. Mowgli and her family are left clinging to a raft before she’s tossed into the sea and found by animals who have taken over abandoned land – elephants and giraffes escaped from zoos; lab monkeys freed from testing facilities. This opening is beautifully rendered in line-drawn animation by Yeast Culture (who memorably worked on Khan’s Desh). You see the top of the Eiffel Tower peeking out from choppy waters – but there’s no escaping the bleakness of the theme and a certain despondency pervades even in the show’s more comic moments. Khan is working here with dramaturg Sharon Clark and writer Tariq Jordan, and where some of his recent choreography has suffered from narrative ambiguity, and although some plot points rush by, the message here is set out plainly: that we are guests on this land and must look after it, respecting animals and nature. The production casts actors to act and dancers to dance. The script is delivered in voiceover, a choice that frees the dancers up to move fully, but it can lead to a disconnect between voice and performer – another layer to compute, especially in the lively confusion of conversation. The dancers all wear the same clothes (red vest, grey harem pants), which doesn’t help delineate characters, though you can respect that simplicity is a deliberate if uninspiring choice. The python Kaa, for example, is made from a few cardboard boxes. There are, however, some great scenes: the flashback animations give personality to Mowgli and her mother (Mowgli is virtually mute elsewhere, as she doesn’t speak the animals’ language). There is power when the text stops and we’re left with Jocelyn Pook’s wistful and mournful music, and the dancers juicily squeezing animalistic movements from their bodies. Thomasin Gülgec is a standout. Khan adds playfulness to his kathak-rooted style, especially in the character of Baloo, an escaped dancing bear.

4/9/2022,"The 50-metre motor vessel, modest by oligarch standards, is covered in scaffolding and sitting under a hangar in dry dock, one of many such boats being refitted in the Dutch port of Vlissingen. What sets the Aquamarine apart is that, until the day of the invasion of Ukraine, it belonged to Russia’s best-known businessman, Roman Abramovich, a Guardian investigation has revealed. On 24 February, ownership of the yacht passed from a company previously controlled by Abramovich to a close associate of his, the Russian businessman David Davidovich. The Aquamarine is the fifth yacht to have been recently linked to Abramovich, who was placed under sanctions by the UK and EU for his reported links to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. His fleet includes two megayachts worth more than $1bn, which were scrambled to Turkey after Abramovich was blacklisted, and two smaller boats currently moored in the Caribbean. Davidovich told the Guardian that he was the owner of Aquamarine as well as the Jersey-domiciled company MHC Jersey Ltd, which is registered as the owner of the yacht on the maritime database MarineTraffic. “I can confirm that I am the owner of MHC Jersey Ltd and the Aquamarine yacht,” Davidovich said in a written statement. Davidovich also said that he was the majority owner of the British Virgin Islands-listed Norma Investments, an investment vehicle that is listed as the only shareholder of Aquamarine’s owner MHC Jersey Ltd, according to Jersey public record. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported, based on securities filings, that ownership of the Norma Investments, previously believed to be controlled by Abramovich, shifted to Davidovich the day Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. The restructuring was seen by experts as a way to avert the possible freezing of some of Abramovich’s assets. Norma Investments, which had been named as a company belonging to Abramovich in several public filings in the past, had served as a vehicle for venture capital investments. A separate entity called MHC (Services) Ltd also disclosed that Davidovich had taken control of the company on 24 February. MHC (Services) is registered at Chelsea Football Club’s Stamford Bridge stadium, although it is not connected with the club and provides consultancy services. Both Davidovich and representatives of Roman Abramovich did not reply to requests for comment on Abramovich’s links to Aquamarine. Representatives of Abramovich said the oligarch was not the ultimate beneficiary of MHC Jersey Ltd. Aquamarine is undergoing repairs at Damen Shiprepair, a Dutch firm that specialises in the construction and repair of luxury yachts. A source at the shipyard who asked for anonymity said that it was generally understood that it had been Abramovich’s yacht. Aquamarine was built by the Dutch firm Heesen, who delivered it in 2021. At the time of construction, the luxury-lifestyle magazine Robb Report priced it at $40.3m (£33.8). Heesen on its website describes the vessel as a “fast-cruising aluminium semi-displacement yacht with crisp design language and enviable appeal … A shallow draft of only 2.15m makes her a versatile cruising yacht for both the clearwater bays of the Bahamas and the Mediterranean sea”. It can accommodate up to 12 people. According to the source at the Damen shipyard, Aquamarine was brought in to Vlissingen for “structural changes”, on 16 November 2021 but the source said no work has been done on the ship since 10 March, the day the UK sanctioned Abramovich. “Only the crew onboard is allowed to work on the boat. But Damen or any other subcontractors are not working on it.” The Netherlands on Wednesday announced that 14 unnamed yachts linked to Russian sanctioned individuals – 12 of which are still being built – were seized by Dutch customs authorities as part of EU’s sanctions against Russia. There is nothing to suggest that Aquamarine was among the vessels seized. Dutch customs officials and the foreign ministry declined to comment on the ownership and status of Aquamarine, citing the country’s strict privacy laws. Damen also said they did not comment on the status of individual clients. Davidovich said: “To my knowledge, Aquamarine is not subject to any sanctions.” While a number of Russian sanctioned billionaires have seen their megayachts confiscated across ports in Europe, the former Chelsea owner has taken steps to avoid such a fate by moving his two giant vessels – the 140-metre Solaris and the 163-metre Ecliples – to Turkish ports last month beyond the reach of western sanctions. Abramovich has not publicly commented on why the two vessels were moved to Turkey. The Financial Times earlier reported that two more yachts linked to Abramovich were currently moored on the Caribbean Island of Antigua. The government of Antigua has since confirmed that the two yachts moored on its territory belonged to Abramovich.",News/World news,Abramovich-linked yacht in Netherlands changed hands on day of Ukraine invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/08/abramovich-linked-yacht-in-netherlands-changed-hands-on-day-of-ukraine-invasion
4/9/2022,"The three-time Wimbledon champion Boris Becker has been found guilty at Southwark crown court in London of four charges under the Insolvency Act and acquitted of a further 20 counts relating to his 2017 bankruptcy. The six-time grand slam winner, 54, was accused of hiding millions of pounds worth of assets, including two Wimbledon trophies, to avoid paying his debts. The former men’s world No 1 tennis player was declared bankrupt on 21 June 2017 over an unpaid loan of almost £4m on his estate in Mallorca, Spain, in 2013, and £1.2m, with a 25% interest rate, borrowed from the British businessman John Caudwell the following year. The court heard Becker, who has a previous conviction for tax evasion and attempted tax evasion in Germany in 2002, earned a “vast amount” of money, winning about $50m (about £38m) in prize money and sponsorship deals. But Becker, who went on to coach current tennis star Novak Djokovic, said his earnings “reduced dramatically” following his retirement in 1999. The German national, who has lived in the UK since 2012, claimed he had cooperated with trustees tasked with securing his assets – even offering up his wedding ring – and had acted on expert advice. In his closing speech, his defence barrister, Jonathan Laidlaw QC, had told jurors that Becker, who won 49 singles titles in 77 finals over 16 years, had relied heavily on advisers after he became famous and wealthy following his sporting successes. He had been, said Laidlaw, “too trusting and reliant” on the advice given to him by the “numerous advisers” that surrounded him. Laidlaw said that while there was an element of Becker “burying his head in the sand” when it came to matters of money and finance, at the time of the bankruptcy Becker’s life was managed “chaotically” by these advisers. Denying the prosecution’s claim that Becker had given bankruptcy officials the “runaround”, he said: “Some of those advisers were offering genuine good advice intended to be in the defendant’s best interest – others, as may be the way of the world, may have simply wanted a slice of the pie his fame and fortune offered.” Rebecca Chalkley, prosecuting had argued that Becker’s evidence was not credible and that he was seeking to “hide behind his advisers”. “‘The obligations and duties were with him,” she told jurors, adding that Becker not knowing the location of the trophies that “defined his career” was “simply not credible”. Some of Becker’s trophies were auctioned off for £700,000 to pay his debts and he has made various appeals to try to locate them. But after numerous attempts to recover the missing trophies, including a BBC campaign, they are yet to be found. The prizes include two of his three Wimbledon men’s singles trophies, his 1992 Olympic gold medal, Australian Open trophies from 1991 and 1996, the President’s Cup from 1985 and 1989, his 1989 Davis Cup trophy and a Davis Cup gold coin that he won in 1988. Becker, who was supported throughout the trial by his partner, Lilian de Carvalho Monteiro, was found guilty of the four charges by a jury on Friday, including removal of property, two counts of failing to disclose estate and concealing debt. He was bailed ahead of sentencing at the same court on 29 April and could face a jail sentence carrying a maximum term of seven years for each count. Alex Jay, the head of insolvency and asset recovery at the litigation firm Stewarts, says: “Make no mistake, being found guilty in a criminal court of bankruptcy offences is quite rare. Most people, when bankrupted, cooperate with the bankruptcy process, at least to a degree that doesn’t result in criminal charges being brought and proved. The level of Mr Becker’s attempts to frustrate the process, and avoid repaying his creditors, must therefore have been quite exceptional.”",Sport/Sport,Boris Becker found guilty of four charges under Insolvency Act,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/08/boris-becker-found-guilty-of-four-charges-under-insolvency-act
4/9/2022,"The outgoing Metropolitan police commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, has warned against the “politicisation of policing” as her tenure at the top of Britain’s biggest police force comes to an end. Dick was forced out as head of the Britain’s biggest police force after London’s Labour mayor, Sadiq Khan, accused her of failing to deal with a culture of misogyny and racism within the Met. In a farewell letter to London before her last day in post on Sunday, Dick said there was more she wished the force had achieved during her time at the top. But she added: “The current politicisation of policing is a threat not just to policing but to trust in the whole criminal justice system. Operational independence from local and central government is crucial for an effective democracy and is a model respected around the world. We must all treasure and protect it.” The letter was published shortly after Khan took a final swipe at the commissioner, telling a Labour local election event he would not “hide from the fact that I lost confidence in her”. Khan’s confidence in Dick reached breaking point when a scandal emerged at Charing Cross police station, where officers were found to have shared racist, sexist, misogynist and Islamophobic messages. Two of the officers investigated were promoted, while nine were left to continue serving. The Met leadership’s handling of the murder of Sarah Everard in March 2021 by a serving Met officer also caused consternation in City Hall and government. After her killer was sentenced to a whole-life term in September 2021, the Met leadership was expected to show it understood those concerns. Instead, it was mocked after saying that women who were worried about an officer approaching them could wave down a bus. Since her departure was announced, judges have ruled that the Met breached the rights of the organisers of a vigil for Everard with its handling of the planned event. In the letter, published on Friday afternoon, she said: “We hear the criticism, know not everyone has confidence in us to provide a good service when they need us, and have seen among us those whose horrific actions have let you all, and us, down so terribly. “Each one drives us to get better, to root out those who don’t uphold our standards and don’t deserve to wear our uniform. To improve our response so all our communities feel protected by us. “We are listening and acting on what you tell us so we can change for the better. Just this week we launched our violence against women and girls plan, shaped by the views of hundreds of Londoners.” Dick, the first female leader in the Met’s 193-year history, has led the force since 2017, with her original five-year term as commissioner due to end in April this year. Her contract was extended by two years to 2024 only last September​ by the home secretary, Priti Patel, which Khan endorsed. But Whitehall sources made clear that if Dick lost the confidence of the mayor they would not fight to save her. From Sunday, she will take unused annual leave, with her final day of employment being 24 April. She was met with applause and cheers of “hip, hip, hooray” as she walked through a guard of honour outside Scotland Yard ahead of her last day in the job this weekend. Walking down the steps of the force headquarters and in between two lines of uniformed officers on Friday, she was greeted with salutes, which she returned before saying “thank you very much.” Deputy commissioner Sir Stephen House will temporarily serve as acting commissioner while the recruitment process continues.",News/UK news,Cressida Dick criticises ‘politicisation of policing’ in Met farewell letter,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/08/cressida-dick-criticises-politicisation-of-policing-in-met-farewell-letter
4/9/2022,"The 19-year-old man arrested over the shooting of Lady Gaga’s dog-walker last year was released from jail in California earlier this week – by mistake, the authorities have said. James Jackson, 19, Jaylin White, 19, and Lafayette Whaley, 27, were charged after the incident last February, accused of attempted murder, second-degree robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery in connection with the shooting of Ryan Fischer, who was walking the music artist’s French bulldogs. Jackson was mistakenly freed following an appearance in court on Wednesday, NBC first reported, citing unnamed sources. The charges against Jackson appeared to have been dismissed, but with plans to replace them with a superseding grand jury indictment unsealed at the hearing in Los Angeles, the LA county district attorney’s office told NBC later on Thursday. The outlet further reported that sources with knowledge of the court proceedings noted that it appeared records were not updated about the superseding case. Jackson is the alleged shooter in the incident and is also accused of assault with a semi-automatic firearm and of carrying a concealed firearm in a vehicle whilst being a felon. Two French bulldogs belonging to the singer – Koji and Gustav – were stolen in the incident, just a month after Lady Gaga sang the Star-Spangled Banner at Joe Biden’s inauguration at the US Capitol following the insurrection by extremist supporters of Donald Trump there days earlier. A third dog, Miss Asia, managed to evade capture and was recovered by police. Gaga offered a $500,000 reward for the dogs’ safe return but it was reported last month that she hasn’t yet paid the money to a person who returned the snatched pets, on the advice of police who are still investigating the circumstances of the whole episode.

4/9/2022,"Students aiming for high-earning graduate jobs will save £20,000 in loan repayments if they delay university entry, while middle earners face paying £30,000 more over their lifetime, according to new analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The IFS analysis highlights how the government’s student loan changes in England, which come into effect next year, have drastically tilted repayments in favour of highly paid graduates. Students on courses such as medicine, economics and law, which can lead to lucrative careers, would benefit by taking loans under the new format from September 2023, because of the lower rates of interest charged. In contrast, students who anticipate going on to lower-paid jobs should enrol on undergraduate courses this year to take advantage of loan write-offs occurring after 30 years rather than 40 years, and a higher starting income before having to make repayments, under the government’s changes. “For 2022 school leavers, this means that incentives regarding whether to take a gap year will crucially depend on their expected future earnings,” the IFS noted. Ben Waltmann, a senior research economist at the IFS, said: “Student loans reform will reduce the cost of loans for the taxpayer and the highest earners, whereas borrowers with lower earnings will pay a lot more. “How much more exactly is inevitably uncertain but our best estimate is that lower-middling earners from the 2023 entry cohort onwards face the highest extra cost at around £30,000 over their lifetimes. “The eventual impact of the reform is hugely uncertain, and will depend on economic developments and on government policy many decades into the future.” Graduates in the lower-middle lifetime earnings range would be earning £33,000-£36,000 by the age of 30, in today’s money, according to the IFS model. Higher earners would be those in the top 30%, with earnings of £50,000 of more at the age of 30. The IFS said the government’s changes – announced in the spring statement by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak – have stripped out progressive elements of the system introduced in 2012, describing the policy as “moving away from a system which redistributes heavily from high- to low-earning graduates”. Larissa Kennedy, the president of the National Union of Students, described the changes as “calculated cruelness” at a time when the cost of living was soaring. “Ministers are saddling young people with unimaginable debt for the next 40 years of their lives. This is nothing more than an attack on opportunity,” Kennedy said. Under the existing system, the loans of high-earning graduates have interest rates set by the retail prices index (RPI) plus 3%. However, the changes mean that the RPI rate alone will be used to set interest rates. “Under the new system, most will just pay back what they borrowed – neither more nor less. This moves us away from something very much like a graduate tax to something for which the term ‘student loans system’ is much more appropriate,” the IFS said. For most graduates, the 2012-era loan system involved paying back 9% of their earnings above the repayment threshold for 30 years, irrespective of their total debt. Under the changes, with a 40-year repayment period, the IFS expects that more than 70% of graduates will repay their loans in full. The IFS also drew attention to a little-noticed change, which switches the way in which the starting point for repayments will be calculated. Graduates currently make repayments on their earnings above £27,295, with the threshold raised each year in line with average earnings growth. After the government’s changes, the threshold will rise more slowly, based on RPI rates – which the IFS says will alone cost middle-earning graduates more than £10,000 in higher repayments over their lifetimes. “It is somewhat concerning that such a significant change was not mentioned at all in the press materials announcing the reforms,” the IFS said. The changes also make “the higher education funding system in England even more of an outlier internationally” by using lower public spending than most other developed countries to support higher education, the economists said.",News/Education,"Student loan changes in England will cost middle earners £30k, analysis says",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/08/student-loan-changes-england-graduates-ifs-analysis
4/9/2022,"Ever since the day in 1985 when he went from being an unseeded 17-year-old to the youngest male tennis player to win a Wimbledon final, Boris Becker has had a special bond with the British public. Adored for his triumphs, the Wimbledon crowds loved him even in defeat: 10 years after becoming an overnight sensation on Centre Court, Becker was finally beaten by Pete Sampras. But it was Becker the crowd called for, cheering him into jogging a lap of the court so they could lavish applause on him. Nicknamed Britain’s favourite German – he once joked he was “top of a short list” – his bond with the UK has endured for almost 40 years. Even once he hung up his racket, his good humour and colourful love life have ensured he has never strayed far from the public eye. But the man once nicknamed “Boom Boom” for his powerful, aggressive serve is now not only bankrupt, despite once being worth an estimated £38m, but has been found guilty of four offences under the Insolvency Act. He was acquitted on another 20 charges. Southwark crown court heard how Becker was accused of hiding millions of pounds by concealing assets, including the very same Wimbledon singles trophy he won in 1985, from his creditors. In the closing speech of Becker’s defence barrister, Jonathan Laidlaw QC, jurors were told that although there was an element of Becker “burying his head in the sand” when it came to matters of money and finance, “some of [his] advisers were offering genuine good advice intended to be in the defendant’s best interest – others, as may be the way of the world, may have simply wanted a slice of the pie his fame and fortune offered”. Becker’s time at the top is still the stuff of sporting legend – always on the attack, charging up to the net for a devastating dive volley – but his name is now synonymous with not only those successes, but a series of disastrous financial mishandlings, lavish living and allegations of shady deceit. The 54-year-old former BBC commentator and former coach to Novak Djokovic – during which time the Serbian tennis star won seven grand slam titles – was accused of giving officials the “runaround” when he fell into financial difficulties and was told to declare his assets, Southwark crown court heard on Friday. He was accused of hiding millions of pounds in assets before and after being declared bankrupt in June 2017, but Becker said he had done nothing wrong. It was after his retirement in 1999, after 14 years at the top, that Becker’s private life imploded: his tangled love life made him a staple of the tabloid front pages, largely courtesy of a paternity suit, DNA tests, then a divorce from first wife, Barbara, after a daughter was conceived in a brief but infamous encounter with the Russian model Angela Ermakova in the broom cupboard of London’s Nobu restaurant in 1999. “In sport, you’re called old when you are 31,” he said at the time. “It affects your confidence and self-belief. It took me a couple of years to redefine myself. I didn’t know what to write on my passport as a profession. Ex-tennis player? It’s about finding a new role that satisfies you as much.” The current court case was not Becker’s first brush with the law: in 2002, a court in Munich sentenced Becker to a two-year suspended prison sentence and a fine of €300,000 for tax evasion of about €1.7m. Then, as now, Becker threw himself on the mercy of the court, claiming he had done wrong but not knowingly. In a remarkable testimony he said he had been forced to give up his tennis career because of the stress of the tax authorities’ investigation into his case. “Tennis is a very psychological game and you have to be free of fears and worries about what will come your way next,” he told the court, describing a 1998 raid on his Munich home, where his parents were living at the time. His father, who was already living with the cancer that was to kill him, was kept in the house for six hours and prevented by tax inspectors from going to a medical appointment. Any lessons learned from that experience, however, seem to have been lost. The one-time darling of the crowds is now looking to rebuild his life.",Sport/Sport,Boris Becker: from tennis greatness to financial disaster,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/apr/08/boris-becker-from-tennis-greatness-to-financial-disaster
4/9/2022,"Extensive UK tours by orchestras from the EU are, one suspects, likely to be rarities for some time to come. A combination of the lingering consequences of the pandemic and the extra layers of bureaucracy imposed by Brexit make the organisation of such undertakings much more challenging, so the current six-date tour by the Zagreb Philharmonic – its first visit since 1974 – is rather remarkable. Jan Latham-Koenig is the conductor for all the concerts, which include music by Croatia’s most familiar composer, Dora Pejačević, alongside repertory works by Sibelius and Mahler. The tour-opener, in the rather bright, sometimes unforgiving acoustic of the Anvil, suggested that the Zagreb orchestra is a feisty, highly accomplished band, which more than compensated for its occasional lack of tonal refinement with an energy and vividness that Latham-Koenig exploited in his performance of Mahler’s First Symphony. It was very much an interpretation presented in bold, primary colours, without a great deal of subtlety but with very loud, almost brash climaxes which allowed the brass much more chance to assert itself than the orchestra’s woodwind. That assertiveness did result in some problems of balance, and in Sibelius’s Violin Concerto, too, there were passages in which the soloist, Tamsin Waley-Cohen, had to fight just a bit too hard to make her finely chiselled lyricism heard. But the general profile of her approach – severe and brisk in the first two movements, far more unbuttoned in the finale – came across clearly, even when some of the details were obscured. Four of Pejačević’s orchestral songs, sung by the soprano Marija Vidović, had opened the concert. Settings from 1915 of poems by Karl Kraus and Rilke are ambitious late romantic essays, with Strauss and perhaps Zemlinsky as their stylistic references, while the two Butterfly Songs, composed in 1920 just three years before Pejačević’s death at the age of 38, are charming miniatures, composed with the lightest of touches, which Vidović presented with just the right combination of tact and charm.

4/9/2022,"England have amassed 131 points in their opening two Women’s Six Nations victories, conceding just five, but Wales will head to Kingsholm without fear for a meeting with the defending champions. After two overwhelming victories on the road, against Scotland and Italy, England will play their first home match of the campaign at Gloucester’s stadium in front of more than 14,000 fans. However, 10 members of the Welsh squad play their club rugby for Gloucester-Hartpury and visiting supporters are expected to turn out in force – it may prove to be the closest thing possible to a home game for unbeaten Wales without playing just across the border in Cardiff. The head coach Ioan Cunningham, who recruited a DJ to play during Welsh training sessions this week, believes his side are ready to face the music against opponents who have won 20 consecutive Test matches. “We can’t wait. We want to see where we’re at,” he said. “We want to compete against the best in the world, so this is a great opportunity for us. The players train and play with and against the England players week-in, week-out so while we respect the side, there is familiarity, not fear. It will be fantastic to play in front of a huge crowd which will hopefully include some Welsh voices.” Cunningham makes five changes to the side that fought back from 19-7 down against Scotland last week to win 24-19. Donna Rose starts at loosehead prop, Sioned Harries slots in at No8 with the captain, Siwan Lillicrap, switching to blindside flanker. Wales also field a new half-back pairing, with Robyn Wilkins starting at fly-half and Ffion Lewis at No9. The 18-year-old Sisilia Tuipulotu, meanwhile, makes her debut in the second row alongside Gwen Crabb. “We just want her to be herself and enjoy the occasion,” Cunningham said of Tuipulotu. “If she’s good enough, she’s old enough.” England’s Lydia Thompson scored a hat-trick in the 74-0 dismantling of Italy in Parma last Sunday but the head coach Simon Middleton said she “picked a bump up in training” this week and is sidelined as a result. Thompson’s absence is one of seven changes to the England XV with Jess Breach returning on the wing for her first start since May last year. Marlie Packer is back at No 7 and Abby Dow, who usually plays on the wing, starts at full-back. At scrum-half, Lucy Packer of Harlequins makes her first start after three caps from the bench, while Poppy Cleall moves to the second row and Sarah Bern comes into the front row in place of Shaunagh Brown. The highly experienced centre, Emily Scarratt, is back at No 13 to win her 99th international cap. Sarah Hunter, who captains the side at No 8, believes two comeback victories against Ireland and Scotland demonstrate Wales’s spirit and the task at hand for England. “They’ve come from behind, which is a really tough thing to do, and that just shows the belief that they have in one another,” Hunter said. “If they’re in the the game they’ll bring it to you, and they’ll force errors and they’ll make it tough. We want to be in a place where we don’t want to let them into the game. They’ve got a really strong set piece, that’s the heart of their game.” Middleton agreed. “We’re very conscious of Wales’s set-piece,” he said. “We were good last week, we were really good in lots of things we did, but defence in particular is one thing we can still improve on.”",Sport/Sport,Wales’s women happy to face music against finely-tuned England in Six Nations,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/08/waless-women-happy-to-face-the-music-against-finely-tuned-england
4/9/2022,"Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal and a Donald Trump ally, has accused a “finance gerontocracy” including Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon of hindering bitcoin’s progress. The outspoken libertarian tech investor described multibillionaire Buffett, the world’s richest investor, as the “sociopathic grandpa from Omaha” in a keynote address at the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami on Thursday. Thiel’s address began with an analysis of the investment merits of cryptocurrencies but soon escalated into a tirade against the financial establishment, including “bankrupt” central banks and the “hate factory” of ESG – which stands for environmental, social and corporate governance and is a cornerstone of responsible investing principles. “It’s a movement, and it’s a political question, whether this movement is going to succeed, or whether whether the enemies of a movement are going to succeed in stopping us,” he said, shortly before naming Buffett as “enemy number one”. In a speech that also cited JP Morgan’s CEO Dimon and Larry Fink, chair of investment group BlackRock, he said institutions run by a “finance gerontocracy” were hindering the cryptocurrency. Thiel said choosing not to invest in bitcoin was a “deeply political choice” and the financial establishment should be told “you have to get onboard on this”. Thiel added that the $830bn (£638bn) bitcoin market could rival the global equities market, worth more than $100tn. Comparing bitcoin with conventional capitalism, he said, to applause: “Woke companies are sort of quasi-controlled by the government in a way that bitcoin never will be.” Thiel, 54, is the most high profile Trump supporter in the tech industry, having donated millions of dollars to Trump’s 2016 campaign and served on the ex-president’s transition team. Casting the progress of bitcoin in political terms, Thiel rounded off his speech with a libertarian rallying cry depicting cryptocurrency’s progress as a battle between ESG and a “revolutionary youth movement”. “If we had to summarise this in in one frame, it is … the finance gerontocracy that runs the country through whatever silly virtue signalling, hate factory term like ESG they have versus what I would … think of as a revolutionary youth movement.” He added: “We have to just go out from this conference and take over the world.” Thiel announced in February that he was stepping down as a board director at Facebook’s parent, Meta.

4/9/2022,"One of Domingo Hindoyan’s stated ambitions when he took on the chief conductorship of the Liverpool Philharmonic was to get the orchestra performing more opera. A concert performance of Bartók’s Bluebeard’s Castle was the first glimpse of what’s to come operatically during his tenure. “Where is the stage – outside or within?” the opening monologue asks. Bartók’s only opera is a disturbing tale underpinned by a general murkiness, a searching inward psychodrama as Judith slowly discovers just how troubled Bluebeard really is. The bright white interior of the Philharmonic Hall is less than ideal for such gloom but the artistic team, led by producer Katy Wakeford-Brown, made the best of a tricky assignment. Strong red hues throughout, plus X Factor-style lights that swivel at the climactic opening of the fifth door, certainly added oomph. Bloody axes, shiny armour and gothic castles projected behind the orchestra gave the performance its basic, traditional framework, but with both leads reading from scores the dramatic potential was minimalised. Adrienn Miksch, a late replacement for an indisposed Jennifer Johnston, portrayed a determined Judith, adding a febrile edge to her probing of Károly Szemerédy’s sullen Bluebeard. Hindoyan’s direction of Bartók’s thrilling score had a convincing thrust to it, drawing a good deal of sonic terror – the pick being the shimmering Lake of Tears behind the sixth door. But this opera is so much more than its breathtaking sounds, and in a piece that can shock to the core, the drama fell a little short.

4/9/2022,"It may have taken a war to bring into sharp relief, but step by step Britain’s foreign policy has become more militarised since Brexit, becoming an increasingly defining feature of Boris Johnson’s premiership. Today the UK wants a leading role in helping to arm Ukraine. It organised a “donor’s conference” of military aid last Thursday, and this week ministers demonstrated missiles and armoured vehicles that it hopes to give to Kyiv’s embattled forces to Ukrainian ministers and generals. Helping Ukraine as it fights Russia’s unprovoked invasion is not particularly contentious, but it is less than a year ago – in May 2021 – that two Royal Navy ships were sent to Jersey as part of a post-Brexit dispute over fishing rights with France. Aukus, a tripartite military pact between the US, Australia and the UK also emerged last year, initially to supply nuclear-powered submarine technology to Canberra. That too involved conflict with France, which had been supplying diesel-powered submarines to Australia, only for Paris to discover its partner had been secretly negotiating an alternative. Aukus was further extended this week. The three countries are also to work on developing hypersonic missiles, which Russia and China already possess. In theory they can be nuclear armed, but Aukus members insist any of the high-speed, manoeuvrable warheads they use will be conventional. Shipping weapons and engaging in new arms races is far removed from the promise of Brexit that Boris Johnson outlined in a speech he gave in Greenwich in February 2020, just after Britain completed its exit from the EU. “Global free trade needs a global champion,” he said, as he talked up the prospect of trade deals around the world. Peter Ricketts, a former national security adviser, said: “Brexit was sold on an economic ticket, but it has fallen by the wayside.” Britain’s trade deal with Australia is expected to add 0.02% to the size of the UK economy over 15 years. “Trade deals have not proved to be the eye-catching dimension of Global Britain they were built up to be, whereas military agreements make the news, and increasingly fit the moment,” he said. Aid spending was cut by £4bn a year in 2020 and will remain below the 0.7% statutory target until 2024-2025, while defence spending was boosted by a similar amount, £16.5bn, over four years. Robin Niblett, the director of the Chatham House foreign policy thinktank, said Britain had long had a strong military component to its foreign policy, but that leaving the EU has inevitably brought it to the fore: “The military element is something a British leader can refer to to show the UK is a credible global power,” he said. Johnson played host to Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, at Downing St on Thursday, promising to launch a “proper thoroughgoing security, defence partnership” between the two countries. In fact the relationship between London and Warsaw is already close. Britain agreed in November to send 550 troops to Poland in three stages. Eastern European Nato members have also made clear they want greater direct military support as part of “deterrence by defence” plan to keep Russia at bay – and the UK is expected to respond positively as a plan is hammered out later this spring. “Nato is the club that Britain remains a part of,” Ricketts said. The question is whether UK has the resources to match the ambition. It is also nominally committed to the Indo-Pacific tilt outlined in its integrated defence and foreign policy review last March. Evidence of the tilt in action has been modest, however, beyond the Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier’s voyage to the Pacific last year, in which the British flagship had to rely on a US destroyer and fighter jets, as well as a Dutch frigate, for escort. Soaring inflation also means defence budgets are falling, by 1.9% a year in real terms against CPI, according to the Institute of Fiscal Studies. But the crisis in Ukraine is continuing, the calls for help from eastern Europe are becoming louder and Johnson remains eager to show Global Britain has meaning – all of which means militarisation is here to stay.",News/Politics,"The UK may try to flex military muscles, but has it got what it takes?",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/08/uk-may-flex-military-muscles-ukraine-has-it-got-what-it-takes
4/9/2022,"Just because many of us have been walking for most of our lives doesn’t mean we’re doing it in the best way. So what is the healthiest way to walk? I spoke to Annabel Streets, author of 52 Ways to Walk: The Surprising Science of Walking for Wellness and Joy, One Week at a Time. There are many areas of health – mental health, emotional health, gut health, etc. Can walking really help them all?I think so! The air you want to walk in should be full of negative ions, which happens where water is crashing. Waterfalls are brilliant. One study compared different groups of care workers. One group walked near waterfalls, one stayed inside, and another walked in the mountains. The waterfall group had far less psychological distress, improved lung capacity and much higher levels of an antibody called secretory immunoglobulin, which is found in the mucosal lining of our mouth and nose, and in our gut. Alas, there are no waterfalls where I live in London.Head to a park and find a water fountain. It’s the best we’ve got. What’s the best time to walk?That depends. If you’re a poor sleeper, you need to walk for at least 10 minutes within an hour of waking. It’s no good being by a window – you need maximum light in the back of your eyes telling your body to sleep again in 15 hours. A walk in the late afternoon also gives your body a reminder, ideally in a forest. One of the studies I looked at found that for people who walked in a pine forest, the effect was similar to taking a sleeping pill. If you’re walking for mood, the science says get out early too. But I hate mornings!Night walks can be good. Especially if there’s a full moon. The average person sleeps 20 minutes less on a full moon. Our ancestors would have used the moonlight as an extended day – we’re designed to be out in it. I’m guessing my usual walk through congested streets is not the healthiest.Afraid not. I do see some good buildings though.If you’re doing that, I always tell people to look out for fractals. Fractals?A fractal is a repeating pattern, often found in nature and absolutely everywhere in architecture. When we look at a fractal, we instinctively relax – our brain produces feelgood alpha waves. That sounds like an improvement on just reading emails.I’d urge you not to do that – you could get hit by a car! And you can’t hear the birdsong. A study found that people who lived in cities had their mood lifted by birdsong. Also, what happens to your body when you look out at the horizon? Your stress level drops, the cortisol falls. It’s why we love views. You talking about birdsong gave me a flashback. The nightclubs would kick out at 4am, but it would be a little while until the first tube, so my friends and I would walk in the direction of home until we could get on a train. It was an almost religious experience. The city’s empty and the sun’s coming up, you can hear the birds, see the buildings, feel their history …Wow, that sounds like a good reason to go clubbing. “I’ve gone clubbing, but only for the walk home.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,What is the healthiest way to walk?

4/9/2022,"During lockdown, Spasia Dinkovski started making böreks and selling them on Instagram. Soon, her side hustle grew into a full-time biz called Mystic Börek, inspired by her grandmother’s cooking in Macedonia. I loved the drama of a huge börek in a pizza-style box. This chocolatey Easter börek is my homage to Spasia’s, which brought a little light to my lockdown. I use ghee in this recipe, because, as cook and food writer Melek Erdal points out, it is best for filo because it doesn’t burn in the oven. Prep 15 minCook 1 hr 20 minServes 10-12 130g cream cheese1 egg90g sugar¼ tsp orange blossom waterA pinch of flaky salt240g ricotta1 x 270g pack filo pasty (7 sheets)150g ghee, melted over a gentle heat100g milk chocolate, choppedFor the syrup50g caster sugarThe juice of ½ orange To finish10g dark chocolate, melted10g crushed pistachios Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. In a bowl, gently beat the cream cheese with the egg and sugar until smooth. Mix in the orange blossom water and salt, then stir in the ricotta. The filling should be loose, but not too runny – you will be spreading it over the filo. To assemble, lay out four sheets of filo lengthways on a work surface, overlapping the ends to make one continuous sheet. Brush liberally with the melted ghee, lay the remaining three sheets of filo over the first three on the bench, again overlapping them slightly and leaving the final sheet on the bench in a single layer (this will make it easier to wrap the end under the spiral). Liberally brush with ghee. Spoon the ricotta mixture over the middle third of the filo, leaving space at the bottom and top so it’s easier to roll it up. Sprinkle the chopped chocolate over the ricotta. From the bottom, roll the filo up tightly into a sausage shape. Then, starting at the end with two layers of filo, turn the pastry into a spiral shape, gently guiding it from one end of the work surface to the other. Don’t worry if tiny splits form. Once you’ve reached the end, gently tuck the pastry tail under the spiral and lift it into a cast-iron pan or a closed bottom cake tin. Make sure there are no gaps in the tin, otherwise the ghee will spill in the oven. Brush the börek liberally (but don’t drown it) with ghee and bake for 50 minutes to an hour, until golden all over. Meanwhile, make the syrup, put the sugar, orange juice and 60ml water in a small pan, bring to a boil and cook rapidly for two to three minutes. Leave to cool a little, then pour over the börek while it’s still warm. Drizzle with melted chocolate, sprinkle over the pistachios and serve warm on its own or with ice-cream.

4/9/2022,"Boris Johnson is congratulating himself on doing so much to help Ukraine, but Britain is like a doctor treating a patient is symptoms after causing the infection in the first place. The weapons shipments are crucial, as are plasters and painkillers when someone’s unwell, but there is no sign yet that Downing Street recognises how to treat the underlying condition. The Kremlin is solely to blame for the horror it is inflicting on the Ukrainians, but its ability to wage war derives from the wealth it has accumulated. And that is something we share responsibility for, and something we should address as urgently as we are providing Kyiv with missiles to destroy Russian armoured vehicles. For far too long, Britain welcomed the Kremlin’s companies and oligarchs and allowed them to raise funds on our financial markets. Our lawyers defended their interests, our accountants filed their accounts and our shell companies protected their assets. Our professionals may have dropped their oligarch clients in the past six weeks, but the damage had already been done: the Russian state would have nothing like the wealth it has now, and would thus not be able to wage this war, without the assistance they provided. And does anyone really believe that, once the memories of Bucha, Kramatorsk and Mariupol have faded, the City won’t sell its services to the Kremlin elite again? If we wish to degrade the oligarchs’ influence and undermine Russia’s military in the long term, we need to stop them ever doing business in this country again. There are two reasons why Britain has allowed Russian kleptocratic wealth to flow through the City of London in such vast quantities. The first is that we have cared only about the fees it generates, not about how it was earned. The second reason is more complex, and lies in the nature of Vladimir Putin’s regime. The Kremlin controls everything in Russia, and it interchangeably uses whatever tools are available – the military, the FSB, the economy, organised crime, embassies, the media – either singly or in combination, for whatever task it wishes to address. This is fundamentally different to how the British state operates, and that has allowed the Russians to slip through the cracks in our system with ease: the threat is not purely criminal, so it’s not the police’s responsibility; it’s not military, so the Ministry of Defence doesn’t step up; it’s not run by spies, so our security services don’t step in. For far too long, the threat posed by Russia has always been – for British officials – “somebody else’s problem”, and has thus never been adequately addressed. This is a shame, because there is one vulnerability in Putin’s system that the UK is perfectly placed to address. The Kremlin’s ability to move illicit wealth seamlessly through the offshore financial system, and therefore through London, underpins every aspect of its behaviour. When British shell structures were used to hide the ownership of billions of pounds laundered out of Russia, the government did nothing about it, thanks to its failure to appreciate the security threat inherent in anonymous wealth pouring into our country. When Russian state companies raised capital in the City, British politicians did not recognise we were effectively funding the Kremlin’s war machine, and instead welcomed the business we were generating. When oligarchs bought up swathes of west London, we didn’t consider that we were providing them with a stable home for their wealth, so they could build a looting machine at home, and instead welcomed all the stamp duty they were paying. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has this week been lecturing the Europeans about buying so much oil and gas from the Russians. But by protecting and managing the Kremlin elite’s money, Britain has been at least as complicit as Germany in helping Putin build his aggressive regime. To expose, investigate and block the Kremlin’s money, we need three things, all of which are easily achievable if the political will can be found: proper transparency of shell companies, so we know who owns what; robust regulation of professional enablers, so crooked lawyers and accountants can be prosecuted; generous funding of law enforcement, so we can confiscate suspicious wealth. And those three policies should be coordinated by a fourth: a single individual who is responsible for tackling illicit finance, who can force agencies to take action and can confront politicians who drag their feet, and who can stop the Kremlin’s infiltration of our economy being “somebody else’s problem”. We must take kleptocracy as seriously as we take terrorism, and that requires more than just an MP being named “anti-corruption champion”. So far the government has relied on sanctions to block the oligarchs’ wealth, but sanctions do nothing to destroy the networks that moved that wealth in the first place. Taking more substantive action will mean enforcing greater regulation, which will undeniably cost us money, just like stopping any of the oligarchs’ companies from listing on the London Stock Exchange would have cost us money. But it will help protect our society from infiltration by kleptocratic wealth, undermine the Kremlin’s ability to threaten others and – in the long term – weaken Putin’s hold on power. In the past, such policies have been blocked by the Treasury, which has prioritised maintaining the underregulation that it considers crucial to the competitiveness of the City over defending the integrity of our financial system. And new regulations will undoubtedly be unpopular with wealthy people who have for decades been using exactly the same tricks as the oligarchs to minimise their taxes and disguise their wealth. The question now for government ministers is this: are they prepared to put their support for the Ukrainians ahead of the tax breaks and loopholes enjoyed by their friends, donors and – in the case of Rishi Sunak – wives? Because until they are, they won’t really be helping the Ukrainians at all.

4/9/2022,"The mental health of the UK’s transgender community is at crisis point, with many people “hanging by a string”, professional bodies and support groups have told the Guardian. The stark warnings follow a week of intensified public discussion of transgender rights as the government moved to exclude trans people from a ban on conversion practices. The Equality and Human Rights Commission also published guidance saying transgender people could legitimately be excluded from single-sex services if the reasons were “justifiable and proportionate”. The focus on such issues has raised concerns among experts, who see a direct line between statements made by politicians and individual wellbeing. “There is strong evidence that minorities experience greater levels of stress when their rights are being debated,” said Dr Adam Jowett, the chair of the British Psychological Society’s Sexualities Section. “The mental health of the trans community has been affected not just in the past week but over the past few years: by the perception that the government is hostile to trans rights, the sense that they are not protected and the fact this is happening against a backdrop of hate crime and transphobia on the rise”. Jowett conducted research for the UK government on conversion practices last year ahead of its consultation on a ban. He emphasised that all psychological and medical bodies in the UK – including the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the British Medical Association – were united in the view that the practice was unethical, potentially harmful and not supported by evidence. “We feel it is absolutely necessary for transgender people to have the same level of protection as everybody else.” In the past week, support services for trans people have reported an increase in demand: the anti-abuse charity Galop, for example, said it was taking calls to its helpline “from trans people who feel exhausted and dispirited by their exclusion from the government’s proposed conversion therapy ban, and the surrounding conversation on social media and in the news”. Meanwhile, individual families contacted the Guardian privately to express their despair at what was described as “a perfect storm of transphobic misunderstanding and misinformation, which is hurting the same vulnerable young people they claim to be protecting”. “All LGBT young people, but trans young people especially, are suffering a crisis in mental health,” said Dominic Arnall, the chief executive of Just Like Us, a UK-wide charity that works with schools to support LGBT+ youth. “It’s driven by the constant drip-drip of negativity from government, media and others, creating a climate that says they are not worthy of the same human rights and freedoms the rest of us enjoy. “The past week in particular has been tremendously difficult for trans young people. They hear the prime minister describing conversion therapy as ‘abhorrent’ but then not banning it for trans people.” Oscar Hoyle, who runs Blossom, a support service for LGBT+ young adults in Surrey, said: “You can’t look at a computer without seeing something questioning a fundamental aspect of who you are. “It puts the young people we work with in the position where they never know who is going to support them and who is going to question who they are. “Members of our community are struggling and I know from experience that the mental health of a large number of trans and non-binary people at the moment is certainly hanging by a string,” they said. But they added: “As trans people I think we develop a really unique sense of resilience which means no matter what we face, our community will continue to move forwards. Things are incredibly hard but I don’t want to underestimate the true value of our community, the wider LGBTQ+ community, and allies coming together to support and uplift trans individuals.” This exclusion of transgender people from the conversion practices ban prompted the resignation of a senior equality adviser and cancellation of the government’s flagship international LGBTQ+ conference in the face of a mass withdrawal of stakeholder support. Boris Johnson then stated that “biological males” should not compete in female sporting events and that women should have “dedicated” spaces in hospitals, prisons and changing rooms. This last statement reflects new – non-statutory – guidance published by the EHRC on single-sex services. Critics argue this focuses on the exclusion of trans people, and specifically trans women, risking illegal discrimination. The guidance was welcomed by gender-critical feminists as “a big step forward”. Helen Belcher, the chair of the education and advocacy group TransActual and a Lib Dem councillor, said: “I am furious that our equalities body is telling me that I am a second-class citizen and can only do things if everyone else is OK with it. Now every trans woman in the country is gearing up to fight to have a wee. It’s vile. “I transitioned around 20 years ago. In the early days you feel very vulnerable, like your appearance is being scrutinised, but then your confidence grows. But in the last few months, all that fear has come back, the same feelings I thought I’d left behind 20 years ago.”",News/Society,"Trans people’s mental health is at crisis point in UK, warn experts",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/08/trans-people-mental-health-crisis-point-uk-warn-experts

Armstrong will continue to host the quiz, with a roster of guest presenters lined up to replace Osman. Commenting on his departure, Osman said: “Pointless has been a joy from start to finish, working alongside my friend Alexander Armstrong, backed by the most wonderful team, and for the best viewers in the world.

Thank you to everyone who watches, it really has been a dream, and I know the show will continue to go from strength to strength.

4/9/2022,"It’s easy to imagine the look of horror on the faces of Hollywood’s VFX artists when Chris Pine said recently that he felt the Star Trek movies are spending too much money trying to imitate Marvel. No more spectacular set-pieces in the depths of space or on opulent alien planets. No more giant special-effects budgets and lucrative months planning how to bring enormous Federation space stations and Klingon warbirds to the big screen in glorious ultra HD. Instead, Pine (who is back as Captain James T Kirk in a forthcoming fourth Star Trek film in the new rebooted timeline) seemed to be imagining a return to the low-budget vision of the future seen in the original series – or at least, one that doesn’t cost serious megabucks.“I’ve always thought that Star Trek should operate in the zone that is smaller,” Pine told Deadline. “You know, it’s not a Marvel appeal. It’s like, let’s make the movie for the people that love this group of people, that love this story, that love Star Trek. Let’s make it for them and then, if people want to come to the party, great. But make it for a price and make it, so that if it makes a half-billion dollars, that’s really good.”Pine added: “But we operate in a system now which I don’t know how much longer we have if you have to spend $500m on a film to reach … even you have to pay all sorts of people back. So to make a billion, it’s like you haven’t even … brought your net in. So I mean, if I had my business suit on, that’s what I would do, but I don’t know where that is. That’s all above my pay grade.”It is certainly true that Star Trek did not get where it is today by spending vast budgets on elevated special effects. The original series that ran on TV between 1966 and 1969 was known for its cheap-as-chips vision of the 23rd century, so much so that the iPad-like hand-held devices used by the crew of the Starship Enterprise were reputedly based on a children’s toy called the Magic Slate, with a few lights added to make them look kosher.Such cost-saving shortcuts would be difficult to pull off in modern Hollywood – cheap effects can give a movie a bad name before the opening credits have even rolled. But Pine is right to suggest that the key to success in 2022 is not necessarily just to do everything Marvel does. The Disney-owned superhero saga’s essential formula – huge, expensive fantasy spectacle and plenty of well-written jocularity – has often proved disastrous when other franchises have tried to borrow it.The DC “extended universe” never quite recovered after parachuting The Avengers’ Joss Whedon in from its rival studio after Zack Snyder stepped back from 2017’s Justice League, while some Star Wars fans hated the same year’s The Last Jedi for apparently lampooning The Force, its more po-faced adherents, and the saga’s storied past. It’s hard to tell if Tom Cruise-led monster picture The Mummy, which came out around the same time, was going for Marve-style action comedy, because the entire movie is such a diabolical mess. But it wouldn’t be surprising to discover that somebody involved (probably Cruise, who reportedly had contractual control of everything) thought plumping for throwaway quips and a breezy, irreverent vibe was a great way to adapt a classic monster tale that’s as creepy and gothic as they come. There have been great science-fiction movies made relatively recently that neither cost the planet Vulcan to make, nor tore such a hole in the thematic architecture for hardcore fans. Whedon’s own Serenity, perhaps the closest thing to Star Wars ever to reach the big screen before JJ Abrams’ Star Trek films, cost just $39m (albeit in 2005). Neill Blomkamp’s District 9 was budgeted at $30m four years later, while Gareth Edwards’ Monsters cost a miraculous $500,000 in 2010. These things can be done.Moreover, Star Trek’s hardcore fans have been crying out for a more cerebral big-screen vision of the saga as a paean to Apollo-era optimism and moral rectitude. The crash, bang, wallop of the brazen, big-budget Abrams-produced movies has not always gone down so well.There is a training exercise in the Star Trek mythos known as the Kobayashi Maru. It’s an unwinnable scenario, designed to test Starfleet recruits’ stamina and ability to maintain calm against impossible odds (naturally Pine’s cocky Kirk defeated it in his first big-screen outing by reprogramming the entire system without his superiors’ knowledge).Looking at Star Trek’s box office travails over the past few years, despite generally strong reviews, you would think Paramount was facing its own insuperable challenge. The truth couldn’t be more different than a Romulan and a Tribble: this is a saga that, three episodes in, is far from doomed. But if Pine is right and a simple tweak to the next movie’s budget helps bring the series up to warp speed, the studio might want to at least consider continuing its mission to boldly go where no man has gone before … but on a lower budget.",Arts/Film,Showing some enterprise: Star Trek must avoid the Marvel money-trap,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/08/star-trek-must-avoid-the-marvel-money-trap
4/9/2022,"With many schools breaking up at the start of the month, the Easter getaway was supposed to be well under way by now – but instead it’s been a week of travel chaos. Airlines have cancelled scores of flights a day, there have been delays at airports and ferry terminals and Covid cases are sweeping the country. We look at your rights if you find yourself seriously delayed or unable to travel. Airlines have cancelled more than 1,000 UK flights in recent days because of high levels of crew absences in part related to Covid infections, but also because they have not rehired enough staff since lockdowns eased. If your flight was cancelled in the two weeks before its departure date and you have chosen to abandon the whole trip rather than find another way to get to your destination, you are entitled to a full refund of the fare you paid, plus compensation. EU regulation 261/2004 compensation rules have been written into UK law, meaning you have exactly the same rights to claim flight compensation as you did before Brexit. If your flight was short-haul – less than 1,500km – you are entitled to compensation of £220 a passenger. For middle-distance flights of 1,500 to 3,500km the figure rises to £350 and for a long-haul destination more than 3,500 km away it is £520. If a flight is cancelled before you are due to depart, irrespective of the reason, you have the right to ask to be rerouted on an alternative flight, either with the same airline or another one. In some cases the airline will offer this – BA told us this week it had been doing so – but it may not always be the case. If an airline cancels your flight at the last minute and you are forced to buy a new flight with a rival carrier, you can claim the cost of the replacement flight. If your original flight was more expensive, however, you’d be better off requesting a full refund. Be aware that airlines often refuse these requests or to cover things such as onward travel by another form of transport to your original destination, but you are entitled to the money. If you are rerouted by your original airline and the replacement flight arrives more than two hours late, you are entitled to £220 compensation a passenger for flights of up to 1,500km. If flights are cancelled because of extreme weather or an air traffic control strike, for example, the EU 261 compensation rules no longer apply. This does not, however, extend to staff absences, according to Coby Benson, a flight compensation expert at the law firm Bott & Co. He says airlines have tried to argue in a number of court cases that staff illness was an extraordinary circumstance and that they should be exempt from having to pay compensation, but they have been rebuffed each time. The overwhelming majority of affected flights this week have been cancelled by just two operators, British Airways and easyJet, suggesting this is not an industry-wide problem. No, but you are entitled to a full refund or a replacement flight. It’s highly unlikely. It might seem very unfair given that the airport has been in chaos all week, but Benson says he is not aware of any possible legal basis that would allow passengers to pursue the airport operator for their losses. The better – ie. the more expensive – policies often include cover for missed departures. The exact circumstances vary, but they will generally protect you in the event you miss the departure of your international flight, ferry, cruise ship or train because of a strike or other public transport disruption. It is unclear, however, if they would cover the incidents such as this week’s airport chaos. Policies usually provide missed departure cover if there is an accident involving the vehicle you are travelling in or it breaks down, but not general traffic delays. A large number of P&O Ferries customers face having their Easter holidays ruined after fully booked DFDS announced it would no longer honour P&O tickets from Dover to France. DFDS had been accepting P&O passengers since its rival suspended its Dover-Calais crossings on 17 March after it sacked nearly 800 members of staff so it could hire cheaper agency workers. The mutual agreement was paused on 8 April because of a lack of capacity, leaving ticket-holders having to rebook with DFDS themselves or Eurotunnel. P&O Ferries has said it hopes to get its ships back in action next week. P&O passengers unable to travel this weekend are entitled to a full refund, but unlike air passengers they are not entitled to compensation or rerouting. Stena announced earlier this week that it was cancelling all ferry services between Fishguard in south Wales and Rosslare until 12 April. Ticket-holders have been told that they can travel on Irish Ferries services from Pembroke docks instead. This will not present too many problems for drivers, but foot passengers and cyclists face having to make the 27-mile journey themselves. Stena staff told Guardian Money this week that no alternative transport had been laid on, but that passengers not travelling in vehicles could ask for a full refund if they didn’t wish to travel. The advice from most experts is that you should not travel if you are displaying Covid symptoms. Few would argue that is morally the correct stance. The government’s guidance for England published on 1 April states that if you have tested positive for Covid, you should “try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people for five days”. It doesn’t say you can’t travel. Rather it says that if you leave your home during this time, there are steps you can take to reduce the chances of passing it on to others, including wearing a mask. How far you are likely to get if you try to travel with Covid will depend on where you are going and, perhaps, whether you are visibly ill. Rory Boland, the editor of Which? Travel, says: “While the government advises that people do not have to self-isolate when they have Covid, some airlines and ferry operators will ask you not to travel with them. “Most travellers we hear from who have symptoms of Covid take a test beforehand and, if they are positive, decide that isolating at home is the responsible thing to do.” He also says flexible booking policies and travel insurance “will continue to be essential to ensure passengers aren’t left out of pocket if they get Covid and can’t travel”. If you do decide to carry on with your plans, you may be able to catch a flight or ferry, but you could be turned away if you are clearly under the weather. Stena Line, for example, states: “When checking in, you will be asked to state your health condition. Passengers with any indication of suspected Covid-19 will be denied boarding.” According to easyJet, for some journeys at some airports there may be a temperature check carried out at departure and/or arrival, depending on destination requirements.“Where there are temperature checks, if you do not pass, you will not be able to fly,” it says. Those heading to the popular Easter destination of Morocco still have to present a valid vaccine pass and proof of a negative PCR test taken within 48 hours of boarding. It is also conducting random rapid antigen tests on arrival for selected groups of passengers. In terms of coming back to the UK, since 18 March, anyone entering the country no longer needs to take a Covid test or fill in a passenger locator form, whether they are vaccinated or not. The government has removed the last Covid restrictions in England and a growing number of other countries are easing their rules, but many still have requirements for people arriving from overseas. France dropped its requirement for a sworn statement that you have not had any Covid symptoms recently on 31 March. Fully vaccinated travellers only need to present proof of vaccination, though those flying into the country are required to fill in an EU passenger locator form. Most adults travelling to Spain can enter without needing to do a test. You must, however, show valid proof of being fully vaccinated and fill in a Spanish “health control form” before you travel. The rules are different for children and teenagers. Unvaccinated youngsters aged 12 to 17 can provide a negative PCR or similar test taken within 72 hours prior to arrival. Spain is one of the countries that says it may do temperature checks on arrival and carry out additional tests if there are concerns. Fully vaccinated foreign travellers entering Canada “by land, air or water” are longer required to do pre-entry tests as of April 1. You still have to submit your travel and vaccination details via the ArriveCAN website or app though, and on arrival border services staff may stop you and say you’ve been randomly selected for a mandatory Covid test. It’s a fast-moving situation, and not every country making changes is easing its requirements. Which? recently published a guide to “16 test-free travel destinations for a no-hassle holiday,” including Mexico and Iceland. If you are going on a cruise, be aware that many operators have quite strict rules at the moment. P&O Cruises, Cunard and Saga are among those that currently require you to do a Covid test at the terminal before you board. In the case of Saga it’s two tests. As you might expect, if you test positive, you won’t be getting on board. P&O Cruises and Cunard say that if that happens, you and any guests travelling from your household will be given a “future cruise credit” to the value of your holiday. Saga says that your cruise will be postponed until a later date. There are other rules too. Cunard stipulates that if you or a member of your household tests positive for Covid within 14 days of your holiday, you won’t be allowed to travel. Saga says you will be denied boarding if you have returned to the UK from an overseas trip in the seven days before your cruise. It all depends on what cover you were offered when you bought the policy. Most travel insurers will cover any medical bills if you catch Covid while abroad. Some will pay for the extra accommodation and new flights required for a delayed return, but plenty will not. It really is a case of digging out your policy documents. Staysure’s enhanced and generous Covid cancellation cover, for example, only applies to policies bought after 29 April 2021, and only as long as the customer has had their recommended vaccinations. It will cover the cost of cancelling because one or all the party goes down with the virus. Plenty of other policies won’t, particularly those bought some time ago.

4/9/2022,"There may be two kinds of bookcase owners: those who own more books than they can accommodate, cramming tomes into every crevice – and those who dot their shelves with artfully placed stacks, and have space to burn on potted plants and framed photos. And then there’s Ashley Tisdale, whose bookshelves are just empty. The High School Musical star recently went viral for admitting to Architectural Digest that she had rushed to fill the in-built shelves in her Hollywood Hills home specifically for an on-camera tour. “These bookshelves, I have to be honest, actually did not have books in [them] a couple of days ago,” Tisdale said. “I had my husband go to a bookstore, like, ‘You need to get 400 books.’” (Her husband’s alternative plan, of “collecting books over time, and putting them in the shelves”, Tisdale promptly dismissed.) A Twitter pile-on naturally ensued. “I am speechless,” declared the tweeter who first circulated the clip. But it turns out the bookshelf bulk-buy is standard practice among the rich and famous – and increasingly so, since books have become established as an erudite backdrop for Zoom. According to MailOnline, Adele spent more than £1,000 in a spree at Daunt Books before the pandemic, “pulling books off the shelves without even looking at the spines or reading the blurbs”. At least Adele bought them herself, points out Miles de Lange, a design specialist at Potterton Books. He says interior designers are often charged with supplying books for clients. “They are props, just like you buy a little objet.” But filling shelves with desirable coffee-table books can cost as much as £5,000 – which clients rarely want to spend, says De Lange. “They’ll give you £1,000, and you can buy 20, but it’s not enough to fill a wall.” The compromise is often a stack of two or three books, with a vase or knick-knack on top. If you do have the budget to splash around on books you won’t read, there are dedicated bookshelf curators such as Thatcher Wine, whom Gwyneth Paltrow hired on finding herself some 600 books short after a home renovation. Wine’s company Juniper Books sells sets of classic literature with custom jackets – a patented approach, he explains, that allows someone to own “the complete works of Jane Austen, but in a certain Pantone chip colour that matches the rest of the room”. Juniper Books and its Colorado “showroom” may seem like the ultimate celebrity foible, but since the pandemic some bookshops have started offering shelf curation services. Publishers, too, accept that many do judge books by their covers. Penguin’s Clothbound Classics series of titles like Ulysses and Emma with Instagram-friendly covers has been hugely successful, with a box set spotted on the Duchess of Cambridge’s desk; a small-format range of 48 titles is coming in August. Bea Carvalho, head of fiction at Waterstones, says books with strong design tend to get shared on social media, driving sales: “Having beautiful images to show off is so important … Sprayed edges go down very well on BookTok and Instagram.” It has encouraged the industry to innovate. Waterstones’ special edition of Lessons in Chemistry by Bonnie Garmus – out Tuesday, and tipped as the book of the summer – has exclusive endpapers, displaying the periodic table. It is a fantastic novel, adds Carvalho, but the design does it justice: “If you love a book, you want to display it proudly.” It is for that reason, Karen Howes of interior design studio Taylor Howes says, designers with a book-buying brief tend to stick to non-fiction, not novels. She tends to “dress the bookcase” with titles relating to her clients’ interests such as wine or aviation – “so that when their friends come it does feel like they have selected all their books themselves”. Novels are where you would get caught out, Howes says: “‘Have you read the latest so-and-so?’ – and you haven’t.” The rise of working from home has allowed for exposure on an even greater scale. The Twitter account @BookcaseCredibility, followed by more than 115,000 people, collates screenshots of celebrities’ bookish backdrops, arguing: “What you say is not as important as the bookcase behind you.” In a video interview with Vogue from her LA home, Adele’s shelves were recently revealed to bear titles such as The Mosaics of Rome and Japanese Prints. “There are some good ones up there,” she said as the camera panned across. Likewise, a close study of Tisdale’s shelves reveals celebrity biographies, reference books, cookbooks and titles on fashion, psychology, wealth generation and self-help – her taste for fiction seeming to extend only to a novel by Ken Follett. Tisdale was at least good-humoured about the criticism she received, sharing her favourite book recommendations (and asking for more) in a post to her lifestyle website Frenshe. She apologised for being slow to respond: “I’ve recently just got a lot of new books to get through.” At least she can see the shelf as half-full.",Arts/Books,Shelf-promotion: the art of furnishing rooms with books you haven’t read,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/08/shelf-promotion-the-art-of-furnishing-rooms-with-books-you-havent-read
4/9/2022,"The French election is straying from the script. It was meant to be a predictable remake. It has turned into a thriller. It could end up as a horror story. A month ago, Emmanuel Macron seemed certain to be the first French president to win a second term in 20 years. After Russia invaded Ukraine, his poll ratings soared. He built a 12-point lead in a probable second-round match-up with the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, and a 15-point lead over all other candidates in the first round. But with that first round taking place on Sunday, Macron’s lead has all but evaporated. In the most recent polls, he only has a two- to five-point advantage over Le Pen in round one, and a two- to eight-point lead over her in the two-candidate runoff on 24 April. Most French political analysts believe Macron will still prevail. Le Pen has magically evaded, so far, any reckoning for her long years as a Vladimir Putin sympathiser. In the second round of French elections, the presidential credentials of candidates are put to a greater stress test than in the multicandidate first round. Le Pen’s economic programme is an incoherent mess. Her European policy is Frexit by stealth – unilaterally reducing payments to the EU budget and breaking EU laws she does not like. She also wants to ban all Muslim women from wearing veils in public – not just the burqa, which was outlawed in 2010. She plans to discriminate against foreigners, including EU nationals, with regards to eligibility for benefits. France is an angry country. It is always an angry country. It is especially angry at present because the Ukraine war has inflated already high petrol, diesel and food prices. But there is no real appetite in France for confrontational policies that would destroy an 80-year postwar political consensus of outward-looking tolerance and European unity. So Le Pen cannot win. Can she? Probably not. And yet the opinion polls suggest that if enough leftwing voters stay at home in the second round, refusing to choose between Macron (“the president of the rich”) and a seemingly “kinder, gentler” Le Pen, then she could win. Just. After covering every French presidential election since 1986 and elections in five other countries, I can think of no parallel for such a late collapse in the position of the presumed favourite. What on earth has happened? Macron’s support has not, in truth, collapsed. It is now averaging 27% – three points higher than it has been for most of the past year. When the Ukraine war began it rose briefly to 31%, as people from the softer left and softer right rallied to the flag and the centrist president. Equally, there has been no dramatic surge in support for the far right. Le Pen’s ultranationalist rival Eric Zemmour has been destroyed electorally by his own years of Putin fellow-travelling. Le Pen’s meteoric rise in the first-round polls mirrors Zemmour’s decline since the Ukraine invasion. In mid-February, they were both on about 16%. She is now on 22-24%, with Zemmour slumped at 8-10%. It is one of the great oddities of the campaign that Zemmour has paid dearly for his Putin idolatry but Le Pen – an even more enthusiastic Moscowteer – has not. Zemmour’s extremism on race and Islam allowed Le Pen to present herself as a mainstream politician close to ordinary people. She spotted early the opportunities provided by low wages and high prices. Since the Ukraine invasion, she has reaped electoral benefits by connecting Russian sanctions – of which she disapproves – to the cost of living. The shift in second-round opinion polls is also not quite so dramatic as it seems – but potentially more significant. Macron’s average runoff lead over Le Pen in the past six months has been 12 points, 56%-44%. Several polls now put them within two to four points. Politico’s Poll of Polls, which was a very accurate guide in 2017, gives Macron a six-point lead at 53%-47% (but falling). There are two main reasons why the projected score is so much closer than when Macron beat Le Pen 66%-34%. First, many more leftwingers say they will stay at home this time. Second, Macron is no longer an upstart, revolutionary-in-a-suit; he is the incumbent. It is an iron rule of French politics that sitting presidents are detested. The 2017 election second round was a plebiscite against the far right; this one could become a plebiscite against Macron. Does Macron deserve to be so detested? No, he doesn’t. He has made many mistakes. He has sometimes seemed arrogant or aloof. He has failed to construct a convincing narrative of success, during his term of office and during a campaign he entered late, distracted by the Ukraine war. When he did finally start campaigning, he took what now looks like an electorally brave (or foolish) decision to propose an increase in the standard French retirement age from 62 to 65. And yet Macron has much to boast about. He has reduced French unemployment to 7.4%, the lowest for 13 years. France weathered Covid better than many other comparable countries, thanks to huge state support for individuals and businesses. His ideas and energy have revived the European Union as a thinking force in global politics, not an immobile, inward-looking bloc. He can still win the election.

4/9/2022,"When Andrew Sheldon first started travelling from Leeds to London to pitch ideas for new television shows, even getting in the door was a challenge for his Leeds-based television production company. “You’d get to London and get to the front desk and be told: ‘Sorry can you come back next week,’” recalled the founder of True North productions. Even when he did get inside, one senior television executive was notorious for welcoming the visitors from Yorkshire as exotic creatures: “You’d go and see them and they’d say: ‘How are things in the north’ and wave their arm across the sky. It was a bit like being in Game of Thrones.” In theory Channel 4’s recent arrival in Leeds should change that. Rather than having to head to the capital to win television commissions, Yorkshire companies such as True North – and smaller start-ups – should be able to build up relationships with commissioners in the same way that their London rivals have long enjoyed. Which is why Yorkshire’s television production companies are baffled the government is risking its own rare levelling up success by privatising the channel, just as the regional work starts to take off. They fear that any private-sector owner of Channel 4 is unlikely to want to keep an expensive office in Leeds or take risks on small start-up companies. “TV in Yorkshire has become a thing again – it’s that hard-to-quantify confidence,” said Pete Brandon. He returned home from London three years ago to co-found Button Down productions. The company, based in a wooden medieval building overlooking York Minster, has benefited from Channel 4’s regional commissions schemes and is hoping to win commissions from the broadcaster. It currently employs five full-time staff and has been considering expansion but the uncertainty caused by Channel 4’s potential privatisation is causing them to think twice. “Would there still be an appetite from whoever owns Channel 4 to commission small regional indies like ourselves, or would all the commissions just go to [global television production giant] Endemol?” asks Brandon. He fears a lengthy parliamentary debate over privatising Channel 4 will leave his business in limbo: “Is it going to turn into TV’s version of Brexit and waste so much time and nothing actually happens?” Veterans of Yorkshire’s television production scene talk about two lost decades of television production in the county, after ITV’s retreat from regional programming in the early 2000s destroyed the career pathways that used to exist and left little more than Emmerdale behind. And while they don’t doubt Channel 4’s current commitment to the region is sincere, many point out that this is a recent development. Channel 4 fought hard against government plans in 2015 to relocate the entire business to Birmingham, and even with the opening of the Leeds office the majority of staff and key decision makers, including the entire top executive team, are remaining in London. There’s praise for the government’s pressure on Channel 4 to boost its regional presence – and bafflement at why ministers want to risk that. Caroline Cooper Charles, the boss of regional group Screen Yorkshire, says the media industry in the region wants the business in public hands: “If a commercial owner was to decide to withdraw that regional presence, that would be very significant for the indie community – many of whom are only just starting to reap the benefits.” Ministers have suggested that some of the £1bn it hopes to raise by selling Channel 4 will be put into regional training programmes for the television industry – but Sheldon says he just wants Channel 4 to spend more on regional programming. “What [the government] is saying is we’ll sell Channel 4 to raise some money to let you do the things you’re already doing. There’s no logic. It’s telly eating itself,” he said. In February Channel 4 put forward its own counter-proposals to government, which would see it seeking private investment while remaining in public ownership. A leaked copy of the document shows the broadcaster’s bosses want to have a commitment to regional output built into its legal mandate, with a pledge to move 300 more jobs out of the capital, rapidly expand the Leeds office, and reduce office space in London. Instead Sheldon has one more proposal that the government should take advantage of its ownership of the channel to push it to be more radical: “One of the things I’ve tried to advocate is that it would have been a brilliant thing to move Channel 4 out of London altogether and put it in Leeds – that would be entirely possible.”",News/Media,‘No logic’: Yorkshire’s TV industry baffled by Channel 4 privatisation,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/08/no-logic-yorkshires-tv-industry-baffled-by-channel-4-privatisation
4/9/2022,"Trans women are no longer able to compete in elite female events run by British Cycling after the organisation performed a significant U-turn and suspended its transgender policy. The Guardian understands that the decision was taken by British Cycling’s board of directors after numerous members – and voices within the sport – raised concerns that trans women such as Emily Bridges, who broke the national junior 25-mile record as a male before transitioning, would have an unfair advantage in the female category. British Cycling also acknowledged there were “concerns” that its transgender policy – which was only ratified in January – did not match the guidance from the Sports Council Equality Group (SCEG), which was based on an 18-month review of the science. However Bridges’s mother, Sandy Sullivan, quickly expressed her frustration, tweeting: “Dumped by email. We’ve just received this in our inbox. We will be making a statement at some point during the next 24 hrs.” Under British Cycling’s previous policy, trans women were allowed to compete if they reduced their testosterone levels below 5 nmol/L for a 12-month period. However, the emergence of Bridges, who began hormone therapy last year as part of her gender dysphoria treatment, and raced in men’s events until February, has led to a hasty rethink. The 21-year-old was due to compete in her first race in the female category at the British National Omnium Championships last Saturday, before cycling’s governing body, the UCI, blocked her as she was still registered as a male athlete for international competitions. The UCI’s decision came as cis women in the event considered a boycott in protest at Bridges’s advantages. However until Friday she was still able to compete in domestic events, before British Cycling suspended its transgender policy, pending a review. In a statement, the governing body said: “Due to the difference in the policies held by British Cycling and the UCI relating to the licensing process, it is currently possible for trans-female athletes to gain eligibility to race domestically while their cases remain pending with the UCI (or indeed in situations where they are deemed ineligible). “This in turn allows those riders to accrue domestic ranking points which impact selection decisions for National Championship races, which is not only unprecedented in our sport, but is also unfair on all women riders and poses a challenge to the integrity of racing. We also understand that there are concerns regarding the extent to which our current policy appropriately reflects the Sports Council Equality Group guidance, published in September 2021.” That SCEG guidance concluded that “testosterone suppression is unlikely to guarantee fairness between transgender women and natal females in gender-affected sports”. It also states that there are “retained differences in strength, stamina and physique between the average woman compared with the average transgender woman or non-binary person registered male at birth”. Earlier this week British Cycling’s head of Olympic programmes, Sara Symington, co-signed a letter to the UCI criticising its current policy on transgender inclusion. The letter signatories claimed the UCI’s current rules do not guarantee female athletes fair and meaningful competition. The prime minister Boris Johnson also intervened in the debate, saying that he didn’t believe “biological men should be competing in female sport events”. In a statement British Cycling said it would conduct a full review of its policy “in the coming weeks”. It confirmed that transgender and non-binary athletes could still take part in non-competitive activities.",Sport/Sport,British Cycling U-turn freezes trans women out of elite female events,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/08/british-cycling-u-turn-freezes-trans-women-out-of-elite-female-events

The mayor of Kramatorsk said there were 4,000 people, most of them elderly, women and children, at the station at the time of the attack. Russia has denied it was responsible. Ukraine has announced it is aiming to open ​10 humanitarian corridors for civilian evacuations on Friday. Once again, civilians hoping to escape from Mariupol will have to use their own vehicles – there will be no convoy of buses. The Ukrainian ​president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said​ the situation in the town of Borodianka was “much worse” than in nearby Bucha. The Kremlin has admitted sustaining “significant losses” of troops in a rare admission of how badly the war has gone for Moscow so far. In an interview with Sky News, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, was asked whether the war had amounted to a humiliation for Russia given the number of troops lost. He replied: “We have significant losses of troops. And it’s a huge tragedy for us.” Russian forces have fully withdrawn from Ukraine’s north to Belarus and Russia, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said. “At least some of these forces will be transferred to east Ukraine to fight in the Donbas,” the report added. Russia said it had destroyed a training centre for foreign mercenaries in Ukraine, north of Odesa, without providing evidence. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to ​​Zelenskiy, said any temporary truce with Russia would just be a war postponed, and that Ukraine was working on the possibility of evacuating civilians from Mariupol by sea. The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said this year’s grain harvest was likely to be 20% down on last year because of a reduced sowing area after Russia’s invasion. Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK, invited ​Peskov to come to Bucha to see the reality for himself “if he has stomach to face these people” after the Kremlin spokesperson denied Russian troops had committed any atrocities there. Ukraine is investigating 5,149 alleged cases of war crimes committed by Russian forces, the prosecutor’s office has revealed. Prystaiko also tried to reassure people that Ukraine would investigate any claims of war crimes against its troops, saying: “We’re making this very clear to all our soldiers that there are some limits. Τhe military are fighting. There are some limits. And each and every incident will be investigated.” The ​president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the EU representative Josep Borrell are on their way to Kyiv. Von der Leyen shared a photo of herself stepping off a Ukrainian train alongside the caption “looking forward to Kyiv”. The UK has added Vladimir Putin’s daughters to its sanctions list, along with the daughter of Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov.

The UK’s Home Office says that 12,000 people have arrived in the UK under the Ukraine visa schemes as of Tuesday.

4/9/2022,"As I write this in late March, the sun is blazing outside, but by mid-April, who knows? That said, Easter is late enough this year for us at least to feel that it’s spring and therefore eat and drink accordingly. So, crisp dry whites and summery rosés are definitely on the cards, and you could lighten up reds a notch, too. If there’s a time of the year that prosecco really shines, it’s Easter. Being slightly sweeter than most sparkling wines, especially (perversely) the “extra-dry” category, it goes particularly well with a colomba di Pasqua, the dove-shaped Easter version of panettone, as well as with simnel cake and, of course, Easter eggs. Personally, I prefer a rosé prosecco, especially the rather smart one I’ve recommended below, which you’ll love if you’re a Provence rosé fan, but even the cheaper ones generally have more character than basic prosecco, thanks to the fruity pinot noir that is typically added to them. And, as opposed to Christmas, when you deviate from tradition at your peril, Easter is a bit more relaxed, so you can afford to be more adventurous, particularly when there’s real value to be had. Hungarian furmint, for example, is a dry white wine that should be on your radar. It’s the same grape variety that produces the country’s famous sweet wine tokaji, and is one of those massively useful dry whites that seems to go with everything, and certainly with those perennial Easter favourites, chicken and salmon. Austria’s grüner veltliner is another to look out for, and Aldi has a particularly good one in its Specially Selected range (12.5%) for £6.99 that’s well worth snapping up. Pinot noir is the most versatile spring red, and there’s a lot around at the moment, especially from more unusual sources such as Argentina. Again, Aldi has a bargain at £6.99 and also the cracking Pinot Vigilante that I’ve been trying to write about for a couple of months and which is finally now in stock (I mentioned it a few weeks back, so apologies if you’ve been frustrated). At £10.99, it’s expensive for Aldi, but not for New Zealand’s Central Otago. I’d drink that with chicken, ham or duck, or anything mushroomy. If you fancy a bigger, bolder red, rioja has evolved in style over the past few years, and many wines are being released significantly younger, resulting in brighter fruit, as shown by the Barón de Barbón below. At the same time, just the name “rioja” will be reassuring to older relatives you may have round your table, so it’s a bit of a winner all round. The Emissary Prosecco Rosé 2020 £14.99 theemissary.co.uk, 11%. More expensive than standard prosecco, but really well made, with delicate, Provence rosé-style fruit. Pajzos Tokaji Furmint 2019 £7.95 The Wine Society, 12.5%. Appealingly smooth, dry, Hungarian white that you’ll like if you’re a gavi fan. Goes with (practically) everything, including a mild curry. Specially Selected Argentinian Pinot Noir 2021 £6.99 Aldi (in store only), 12.5%. Argentina isn’t as well known as Chile for its pinot noir, but this is really good, with clean, bright fruit and it has a freshness that inexpensive Chilean pinot often lacks. Try with roast chicken or duck. Barón de Barbón Oak-Aged Rioja 2020 £11.99 (or £10.49 on a mixed-case deal) Laithwaites, 14%. A young, vibrant rioja that has lots in common with a malbec, but should still keep traditionalists happy. One for the Easter lamb or even a barbecue. Domaine Equis Crozes Hermitage “Equinoxe” Rouge 2020 £17.95 Yapp Brothers, 12.5%. Classic, spicy, northern Rhône syrah that would be lovely with lamb or roast duck.

4/9/2022,"If the idea of a musical about grief sounds unlikely, it can only be because we have a limited idea of what that emotion should look like. The grief in Peter Mullan’s 1998 movie Orphans is not of the maudlin, greetings-card kind. Rather, it is raw, dangerous and off-kilter. So it is in this National Theatre of Scotland staging, directed by Cora Bissett and scripted by Douglas Maxwell with songs by Roddy Hart and Tommy Reilly. It amplifies Mullan’s emotional states into the raucous, the ribald and the plaintive. Set on a dark and stormy Glasgow night, Orphans is about four siblings from a working-class Catholic family who are about to bury their mother. Each embodies a different facet of grief. Robert Florence as elder brother Thomas becomes neurotically protective of the dead woman’s memory, his anguish so profound it seems to rip the roof off the church. Reuben Joseph as Michael turns inward, reflecting on his damaged relationship with his ex-wife as he heads out for a bloody night of self-destruction. Dylan Wood as youngest brother John turns angry, displacing his sense of loss into a thirst for revenge and gun-toting violence. Amy Conachan’s Sheila appears the most balanced, but she too races with a reckless abandon to fill the void left by the central figure in her life. The chaos of the night, with its fights, funfairs and feuds, stands as a metaphor for the family’s inner turmoil. And even though it begins with a coffin and ends with a grave, the emotional extremes put a halt to sentimentality. They also make for a buoyant show. Staged on a set of towering sandstone tenements by Emily James, Bissett’s production makes as much of the wider community – from the chorus of boozy drinkers to a trio of sharp-talking paper girls – as it does of the central players. Faithful to the big-screen original, Maxwell’s script is characteristically funny while respecting Mullan’s dark edges. It’s a shame not to have live musicians, but the songs do well to carry the story forward, while cheerfully revelling in the Glasgow vernacular (not all of it is radio friendly). It adds up to a cathartic reckoning with mortality. Perhaps even good grief. At SEC Armadillo, Glasgow, until 9 April. Then touring until 30 April.",Arts/Stage,"Orphans review – buoyant musical about death, grief and boozing",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/08/orphans-sec-armadillo-glasgow-review-peter-mullan
4/9/2022,"A portrait of the actor, singer and civil rights activist Paul Robeson painted in 1930 by the British artist Glyn Philpot has been rediscovered through painstaking research, after it was sold nearly 80 years ago under the title Head of a Negro. The painting, one of a number of Philpot’s portrayals of people of colour, will go on public display in Chichester, West Sussex, from 14 May, in the first exhibition of the artist’s work for almost 40 years. Philpot’s portrait depicts Robeson playing Othello at the Savoy in London in 1930, the first time in a century that a black actor had been cast in the title role of Shakespeare’s tragedy, and a milestone in theatre history. In 1833, Ira Aldridge had been racially abused while appearing in London as the Moor of Venice. Robeson’s co-star, Peggy Ashcroft, who played Desdemona, was repeatedly asked by interviewers whether she minded being kissed by “a coloured man”. Her response was robust. “Of course I do not mind. I see no difference in being kissed by Paul Robeson and being kissed by any other man,” she told the Daily Sketch in May 1930. Although the production received mixed reviews, Robeson’s performance was acclaimed, with the audience demanding repeated curtain calls. Philpot took his niece to see the play and then invited Robeson and his wife to dinner. The biography of Philpot, a successful society portrait painter who was elected to the Royal Academy at the age of 23, notes that Robeson sat for him but the painting was long thought to be lost. Simon Martin, director of Chichester’s Pallant House Gallery, which is holding the exhibition of Philpot’s work, set about tracking it down. Trawling through images in archives and auction databases, he matched a portrait with a photograph of Robeson in costume as Othello. Philpot’s family had sold the painting in 1944, several years after the artist’s death, under the anachronistic title Head of a Negro. Subsequently sold again and now in a private collection, the painting was tracked down with the help of Christie’s auction house. “It was an exciting discovery,” said Martin. “I had a hunch this painting was Robeson, but I had to match it with press photographs of him playing Othello, and then trace the work.” The portrait has “a nobility about it”, he added. Othello was “the defining role of Robeson’s career – a seminal performance in theatre history. Philpot obviously recognised that it needed to be recorded.” As well as acting, Robeson – the son of a runaway slave, who was born 124 years ago on 9 April – was an athlete, lawyer, singer and political activist. He starred on Broadway and stages around the world, and his bass-baritone voice made him a recording star. He spoke out against fascism, colonialism and racism. During the McCarthy era of the 1950s, his US passport was revoked and 85 planned concerts cancelled. Robeson was brought before the House Un-American Activities Committee and asked to identify members of the Communist party and to admit to his own membership. Invoking the fifth amendment, Robeson told the committee: “You are the non-patriots, and you are the un-Americans, and you ought to be ashamed of yourselves.” Philpot’s subjects included the poet Siegfried Sassoon and prime minister Stanley Baldwin, along with ballet dancers, opera singers and actors. Unusually in the first few decades of the 20th century, he also created sensitive portrayals of people of colour. They included a Jamaican man, Henry Thomas, who was the subject of a number of portraits in the 1930s; the African-American tenor Roland Hayes; a Martinican cabaret performer known as Tom Whiskey, and an African American boxer named Joe.

4/9/2022,"My favourite kind of fashion isn’t the kind that gets itself on the front page. Not the omelette dresses, or the maternity negligees. Praise be to Queen RiRi for both of those, but the fashion moments that get me really hot under the collar are in the small print. The blink-and-you’d-miss-it changes in the fashion weather, when the style winds shift direction, and something suddenly looks chic. I’m talking about, for instance, the first time I saw someone knot the belt of their trenchcoat instead of threading it through the buckle and realised that this was the key to making a trench look more Paris Vogue and less French policeman. Or when I clocked that by shoulder-robing your coat, rather than putting your arms into the sleeves, you could instantly elevate your entrance to any social situation to quite extraordinarily dramatic effect – a bit like the free-styling-trick version of arriving in a private jet. Or when Phoebe Philo at Celine did the hair-tucked-inside-the-polo neck thing. Or when the penny finally dropped that all the cool people had stopped wearing invisible trainer socks with their trainers and started wearing thick white sport socks instead (I think this happened about two years ago actually, but I have only just noticed). This is my stone-cold-favourite kind of fashion. The correct amount to fold your trouser cuff in any given season. To button your shirt to the top or leave two buttons undone? To tuck your shirt in or to leave it loose? To carry your handbag across your body, hook the strap over the crook of your elbow, or tuck it under your arm? This is my jam. This, my friends, is the juicy stuff. This is where you can roll your sleeves up (or not, depending on the season) and get stuck in. This kind of fashion got lost for a bit. After the height of the pandemic, fashion split into two camps. There was the anti-fashion, anything-with-a-fleece-lining crew, and the roaring 20s brigade. The choice seemed stark: reject dressing up altogether or gorge on feathers and frills, like an Easter egg hunt after Lent. Truth be told, none of us gets to choose between turning the clock back to the old normal and taking a great leap forward into a Zen new way of life. We all have to muddle along in whatever the new normal is. From a fashion point of view this is good news, because this is where the meat of the story happens.So, let’s hear it for wearing mid-blue jeans again – not indigo, not washed out, but solid May-skies blue. Let’s dig out an ordinary, inch-thick plain leather belt and start wearing it with slightly oversized trousers, a white shirt and cat’s eye sunglasses – like the influencers do. Let’s experiment with a knee-high boot under a below-the-knee skirt, because that combination is going to be everywhere come autumn, mark my words, so we may as well get a jump on it before the weather gets much warmer. Or leaning into a chunky loafer, if you haven’t already done so. Perhaps you could experiment with a short-ish skirt and a long-ish blazer, which is the new suit-adjacent tailoring look in town. None of this is headline-making stuff, but fashion doesn’t have to be. The best kind doesn’t even look like fashion, really: just clothes that look modern. No drama, no jeopardy, no plot twists. Fashion for a world that just keeps rolling smoothly on. Which sounds like a must-have to me. Hair and makeup: Sophie Higginson using Bumble & Bumble and Stila. Shirt: Monki. Trousers: Maje.

4/9/2022,"I am a divorced woman in my 50s and for the past four years I have been in a long-distance relationship with a kind and considerate man. He runs his own business and visits me for extended periods; we spent most of 2020 together at my house. He is helpful with chores, and was very supportive of me through an intense work-from-home period. Material wealth is not a priority for me. Having a good income myself, I don’t need to consider my partner’s income. I earn significantly more than him and I have always been clear that my main priorities are building a pension and supporting my children, who are now at university. I pay most of the costs for us visiting each other, and other trips. I have also helped when he has had cashflow problems. Recently I’ve found myself more reluctant to do this, and get irritated when he asks for help. I’m at the point where I think this relationship may not be viable in the longer term. My parents’ relationship was a traditional working man/stay-at-home wife. Is my current discontent a reflection of that? Am I unconsciously harbouring a desire for a “patriarchal” male role in the relationship? To be clear, this is not on the scale of ‘The Tinder swindler’ but it would be nice if he occasionally stepped up to meet the costs for shared activities or reworked his business to avoid cashflow crises. His business will probably never bring in that much money, and his relaxed approach is precisely what enables us to spend more time together. I just find myself wishing he earned more. In a way it doesn’t matter why it’s happening, but something in your relationship is making you unhappy. It’s really important to take note of these feelings instead of reasoning them away. Is your partner aware of how you feel? The patterns we observed growing up do tend to inform us – we either copy them or we try to do things differently, but I wonder if your “current discontent” is less about wanting your partner to earn more, and more about making you feel more looked after? And maybe that does involve money for you. Money might mean very different things to each of you, but it can also be a sign of who takes responsibility and who doesn’t, because someone who habitually doesn’t pay their share or doesn’t bother with bills often doesn’t take responsibility for themselves, either. You talk a lot about money, but say material wealth doesn’t matter to you. I wonder if it stands in for something beyond safety, security or freedom? If you could tap into what this is, it may help you work out whether this is fixable or not. Your partner may feel he looks after you in different ways. Psychotherapist Alivia Rose wondered if this was less “about money than you mothering your partner and then resenting it. Do you feel you’re not worthy of an equal relationship?” Rose also wondered if you were “afraid to set boundaries in case he’ll leave you. We only really confront people we feel safe with. You have money now, but what if you got ill or couldn’t work – would he equally support you through those difficult financial times?” I think you need to have an honest conversation. Paying constantly for someone else is exhausting and can end up making you feel used. Be brave, give him the chance to know how you feel and give him the chance to fix it.

4/9/2022,"The number of Covid-19 infections remains near or at record levels in most of the UK, with only Scotland experiencing a drop, figures from the Office for National Statistics have revealed. The ONS data, based on swabs collected from randomly selected households, shows that, for the second week running, about one in 13 people across the UK are thought to have had Covid – an estimated 4.88m infections. In England, the number of infections remained steady in the week ending 2 April, with an estimated 7.6% or one in 13 people in the community thought to have had Covid. In Wales, the estimated rate was up from one in 14 people to one in 13 while in Northern Ireland the most recent estimate was one in 16. In Scotland, 396,800 people – about one in 13, down from one in 12 the previous week – were estimated to have had the virus in the week ending 3 April. Within England, infections rose in the north of the country and the east Midlands, but fell in the south-east. In other parts of the country, including London, the trend was unclear, although levels remained highest in the south-west, where almost 9% of the population were thought to have had Covid in the most recent week. Sarah Crofts, the head of analytical outputs for the Covid-19 infection survey, said there were early signs in the latest data that infections may no longer be increasing in some parts of the UK. She added: “It is too early to say if infections have peaked in England and Scotland. We will continue to monitor the data closely.” The ONS survey confirms that the Omicron variant BA.2 remains the most common variant in the UK. BA.2 is more transmissible than the original form of Omicron, BA.1, that reached the UK towards the end of last year. While BA.2 is believed to have played a key role in the latest wave of infections, experts have suggested the removal of Covid restrictions, waning immunity and a shift towards pre-pandemic behaviour could also be contributing. According to a report from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), released on Friday, several variants of Omicron have now been identified, although not all have been detected in the UK. The report adds that the XE variant – a combination of BA.1 and BA.2 – is now spreading almost 21% faster than BA.2, with 1,125 cases in England identified as of 5 April. The ONS data also reveals variations by age, with infection levels rising among those between school year 12 and those aged 34, while 7.1% of those aged 70 and over were thought to have had Covid in the week, the highest level yet for that age group. However, infections fell among younger children and those between the ages of 35 and 49, with the trend unclear among other age groups. Prof Rowland Kao, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh, said one concern was that most elderly people received their last booster jab more than four months ago. “We are entering the stage where their protection against infection is quite low and so a getting the elderly vaccinated as quickly as possible is going to be important in keeping numbers of infections down, especially with the recent trend towards higher numbers of infections and re-infections being concentrated in the elderly,” said Kao. According to data from UKHSA released on Thursday, just over 15% of people aged 75 and above have received their spring booster vaccination: the programme officially began on 21 March. The agency said the figures include those who have come forward for a third dose (first booster) since that date, as well as those who have received a second booster. The ONS survey now gives the best picture of Covid levels around the UK. From 1 April free testing for Covid ended for most people, with many reporting difficulties getting hold of free kits in the weeks before, meaning far fewer infections are now being picked up by people coming forwards for a test. Experts behind another major infection survey, React-1, issued their final report this week after the government axed funding for the project. The recent rise in infections across the UK has also been reflected in a rise in Covid patients in hospital and, more recently, an increase in in deaths. While the link has been weakened by Covid vaccinations, experts, including Prof Chris Whitty, have warned the NHS is under pressure. On Wednesday NHS bosses urged families to help them discharge loved ones, even if they have Covid, to help the service weather a “perfect storm” fuelled by heavy demand, severe staff shortages and rising Covid cases.",News/World news,"Covid infections remain around record levels in most of UK, figures show",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/08/covid-infections-uk-office-national-statistics-coronavirus
4/9/2022,"Global food prices rose to their highest ever levels in March as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the UN has reported. Cooking oils, cereals and meats hit all-time highs and meant food commodities cost a third more than the same time last year, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization’s monthly food price index published on Friday. The Russia-Ukraine war has disrupted Black Sea exports of crucial commodities from a region that had been producing more than a quarter of the world’s wheat exports. The war has helped push cereal prices up 17% over the past month with the closure of ports throttling wheat and maize exports from Ukraine. Russian exports have also been slowed by financial and shipping problems. World wheat prices soared by 19.7% during March, while maize prices posted a 19.1% month-on-month increase, hitting a record high along with those of barley and sorghum. The FAO said these problems were likely to persist, leading to higher prices, lower stocks and uncertainty in the wheat market in the future. “The higher price quotations are particularly concerning for countries already struggling with other crisis, including conflict, natural disasters, economic conditions or, as it is often the case, some combinations of those,” said an FAO spokesperson, adding that countries with low incomes and food shortages may struggle to pay higher prices. “[Price] increases are the most noticeable in the countries where the share in disposable income spent on food is the highest. In these cases, the most vulnerable are likely to skip meals, purchase less nutritious foods, or use other coping strategies, which will have longer term effects on their health and wellbeing.” Joseph Glauber, senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute, said before the invasion, prices were already near record highs because of limited global supplies. “Projected stock levels were already low relative to recent years, which means that there are few supplies available to buffer the impacts of reduced exports coming from the Black Sea,” he said. IFPRI estimates that Ukraine and Russia accounted for 12% of calories traded in the world. Glauber said the volatility in food prices was being felt everywhere. Countries that were particularly reliant on wheat from Russia and Ukraine may have to switch to the EU, US, Australia, Canada and Argentina for wheat supplies. “Many of these countries are in north Africa and the Middle East where wheat often accounts for as much as 35% of total calories consumed and a majority of the wheat is imported, much from the Black Sea,” he said. The Black Sea region has also been a crucial source for sunflower oil and the limiting of exports has meant vegetable oil prices rising by almost a quarter since February. Prices also rose for palm, soy and rapeseed oils because of increased demand. Earlier this week, the World Food Programme said the effect of blocked exports would hit several countries in east Africa, including Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia and South Sudan – countries already experiencing severe drought and conflict. WFP said the price of local foods had risen a quarter, on average, compared with last year but had been as high as 92% in Sudan. It also warned that eastern African countries are fully dependent on imports for fertiliser, for which Ukraine and Russia are also a key source, and that disruption could impact local production and push food prices even further up.",News/Global development,Global food prices rise to highest ever levels after Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/08/global-food-prices-rise-to-highest-ever-levels-after-russian-invasion-ukraine-wheat
4/9/2022,"In a flourish of passage self-pity and spite, Vladimir Putin recently complained about Russian culture and Russianness being cancelled in the west. The release of this excellent film is here to prove him wrong: a movie about a Russian character behaving menacingly to someone from Finland, Russia’s vulnerable neighbour, and yet being romantically redeemed. There is a bone-chilling cold in the film’s location – Murmansk in Russia’s remote north-west – but a wonderful human warmth and humour in this offbeat story of strangers on a train and of national characteristics starting to melt. It comes from Finnish director Juho Kuosmanen, whose 2016 film The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Mäki was a lovely comedy about a real-life Finnish boxing champ in the 1960s. His new film is adapted from a novel of the same name by Finnish artist and author Rosa Liksom, and concerns a young Finnish student of archaeology, Laura (Seidi Haarla) who is in Moscow sometime in the early 90s; she has begun an impulsive affair with her professor, Irina (Dirana Drukarova). With Irina’s encouragement, and perhaps because this older woman does not care to have her hanging around much longer, Laura has resolved to make the tough rail journey up to Murmansk where she wants to view the petroglyphs – mysterious rock drawings, thousands of years old. Sweet-natured, open-hearted Laura gets on this uncomfortable train in the freezing wintry cold, where she finds that she must share compartment number 6 with Vadim (Yuriy Borisov), a boorish, drunk young guy who is on his way to get a job in a coal mine in Murmansk and is openly abusive, misogynistic and philistine about Laura’s plans. And her phone calls back to Moscow reveal that Irina isn’t exactly pining for her. Of course, it isn’t too much of a stretch to see that after their meet-uncute, the relationship of Vadim and Laura is going to thaw, although the obviousness of this trope has lessened in the last month. The romance that flowers between these two young people is in parallel with the romance of a long rail journey, and this is a very non-American equivalent of Richard Linklater’s Before Sunrise movies. Vadim’s scowling face and shaven, bullet head make him look a tough guy at first, but it isn’t long before we see him as a vulnerable little boy, never more so than when with Laura welcomes another Finnish guy to share their carriage - a self-admiringly sensitive type who insists on singing and playing his guitar. Vadim is fiercely sceptical and resentful of this preening interloper, and he is right to be. In the end, no one wants to help Laura find these petroglyphs that she has set her heart on and travelled so far to see, and it is Vadim himself who has to step up. Yes, this is a Russian without a Z on his clothes or in his heart, and of course the larger point is that of course, there are millions of Vadim’s fellow citizens who cannot be tarred by the malign mediocrity of Putin’s chauvinism. There is charm and gentleness in this scene and the movie as a whole.

4/9/2022,"Adebilitating week for Treasury-based luxury casualwear influencer Rishi Sunak. He used to seem invincible; now he’s the pocket Samson who’s just taken a massive haircut courtesy of his wife. I know Rishi wants to be prime minister and stuff, but it’s increasingly difficult to imagine how the mega-rich chancellor would persuade ordinary British people to do difficult things. Mate – you can’t even persuade your own wife to pay you tax. But before I get accused of being a sexist by … hang on, let me get my lorgnette … James Cleverly, we’d better have a recap of developing events, which now include a possible US green card controversy. Initially believed to be watching his political oxidisation on Pacific time, the chancellor is in fact on these shores. I hear Lynton Crosby has banned Easter getaways, meaning Sunak will have to unwind in one of his houses in this country, as opposed to the high-end Santa Monica apartment he owns in a complex that includes a pet spa. Anyway, he has granted a hotly defensive exclusive interview to the Sun, which runs under the apoplectic banner LAY OFF MY MISSUS. And I think you’ll agree that headline truly captures the way Rishi Sunak speaks. This, quite simply, is a guy who is as at-home screaming a warning out of a van window as he is indulging in a desultory browse of Mr Porter’s fine knits, his cursor hovering briefly over a £495 smoke-blue James Perse cashmere hoodie before the window is closed in listless pique. There are some injustices even a knitwear purchase can’t alleviate. Even so, I think the headline could have been punchier. I’d have gone with PAY TAX? IN THIS ECONOMY?! As for the meat of the interview, I hugely enjoyed the implication that the £30,000 annual flat fee required for Akshata Murty to retain her non-dom status is the typical foreign national experience in this country. As Rishi explains of Murty’s completely legal arrangements: “That is how the system works for people like her who are international who have moved here.” (Great to hear that at least one part of any of the UK system works. “The system works” is really not a phrase you’re hearing a lot right now.) Very enjoyable, too, to read the furious commentary about Murty on MailOnline and in the Daily Mail, whose proprietor Lord Rothermere inherited his own non-dom status from his father. Again: the system works. And listen, what’s not to love about this latest episode of Sunak’s fish-out-of-water comedy? Recent outings have seen the rarefied protagonist’s hilarious interactions with the ordinary world. The one where he goes to the petrol station and fills up someone else’s car, then tries to scan his card on the barcode reader. The one where he fails to do anything meaningful in his mini-budget to alleviate the cost of living crisis for the poorest households, then promptly gives an interview in which he trills: “We all have different breads in my house.” The one where he scans the popular press and comes up with the perfect person to self-pityingly compare himself to in a manner that in no way caused his spads to kick a hole in the wall. As Sunak explained: “Both Will Smith and me, having our wives attacked …” Come on! It’s a funny show! Moving on to the villain trying to sabotage him, their precise identity remains a mystery. Where are all the mean stories about Sunak coming from? Not quite sure we need to activate Nancy Drew on this puzzle – Sunak’s naked manoeuvring, coupled with his vanishing act every time an unfavourable partygate story broke for Boris Johnson, suggests at least the dim possibility that his aggressor may be known to him. My own fan theory, however, is that this is a show where Sunak plays both protagonist and antagonist. Or to put it another way, he is his own worst enemy. The current stories are not a “smear”, as he claims, but the totally predictable consequence of his family’s financial arrangements, which he should have seen coming a mile off. It may be perfectly legal, but it is obviously – obviously! – a giant piss-take if the chancellor’s own wife has non-dom status. Apologies for returning to an achingly familiar furrow for this column over the years, but it really doesn’t have to be this way. The Hong Kong tax code, often cited as the most efficient and avoidance-proof in the world, is around 350 pages. The ever-expanding UK tax code is the world’s longest, currently running to more than 22,000 pages, having increased vastly in size under both Labour and Conservative governments. Unsurprisingly, it amounts to a charter for myriad types of avoidance. Tell you who should do something about this, just like all his recent predecessors should have but didn’t: Rishi Sunak. Instead, he prefers to spend his days saying no to pleas to alleviate hardship, which seems to exist in a universe beyond his comprehension. Hard to pick a low point, but I’ll go with the time he turned down the request from the hugely respected educational recovery tsar Kevan Collins for £15bn in pandemic catch-up funding for children. Sunak would only fork out £1.4bn, which isn’t even twice what he spent buying people free burgers with “eat out to help out”. Collins resigned in despair. It emerged that an internal presentation had shown Sunak and others in Downing Street how failure to invest £15bn now in this failed generation of children would result in the state paying upwards of £160bn down the line in welfare and criminal justice. And still Sunak said no, presumably on the basis that that would all be someone else’s problem in the future. As David Cameron reportedly said to his aides before his post-referendum resignation: “Why should I do all the hard shit?” And why should Rishi Sunak do it either? Why shouldn’t his wife tick the box and keep paying her 30 grand a year to stay out of things? Why shouldn’t statements of fact be denounced as smears? All sorts of things are optional if ordinary people would only realise it. Let them eat different breads.

4/9/2022,"Carried his rider into the history books 12 months ago as a flawless, ground-saving ride by Rachael Blackmore kept him out of trouble and in the right place to strike for home two out. A similar no-nonsense performance in the saddle can be expected but he is 15lb higher in the ratings and it is nearly half a century since Red Rum became the last top weight to win. Repeat wins in the National are extremely rare for a reason – all the stars need to align just to win once –, never mind with more lead in the saddle. A gallant run into fifth or sixth is probably a more plausible outcome. The party-pooper at last month’s Cheltenham Festival, when loud boos rang out from the grandstands after he denied the legendary Tiger Roll victory on his final start. He would be a very popular winner at Aintree, though. The adaptability required to win on his first start over the cross-country obstacles felt like the final piece of the puzzle before his Grand National debut, and he has been attracting plenty of support ever since. With five Grade One chase wins, he also has the class to go with his stamina, but this latest challenge comes 24 days after his huge effort at Cheltenham. With the juice squeezed out of his price, a couple of the fresher horses are marginally preferred. The last horse into the race, a few minutes before the Friday deadline, but would probably have been better off taking his chance in the Topham Trophy over a much shorter trip. Looked like a non-stayer in the Midlands National last time and has even further to travel here. Didn’t seem to stay in the Midlands National last time and has even further to go here. Every Grand National has a hard luck story or three, but few match this one’s tale of woe 12 months ago. Ted Walsh’s runner was travelling sweetly, not far off the lead, when he was stopped in his tracks by a faller at the 12th, losing at least a dozen lengths. Mark Walsh worked his way back into contention two out and was still disputing second at the Elbow, a remarkable effort in the circumstances. He is 7lb higher in the ratings this year, which is more than fair on his 2021 form, and has been freshened up since winning a Grade Three in February. With a bit more luck, he will be very tough to keep out of the frame. There are faint echoes of Rule The World, the 2016 Grand National winner, about this Gordon Elliott-trained eight-year-old, a second-season novice with high-class form over fences but only one chase win. Rule The World had not even managed that when he came home in front six years ago, and Run Wild Fred made it plain that stamina will not be an issue when he finished second in the National Hunt Chase at Cheltenham last time. He did not look like a horse with an abundance of gears, however, and it will be a surprise if a few nippier types do not have the beating of him. Looked likely to be a force in the very best races for years to come when he landed the Grade One Betfair Chase in November 2019, but has one win in 10 starts since. On the plus side, one of those defeats was a close third in the 2020 Gold Cup, and he ran well under a big weight at Cheltenham last month, finishing eighth in the Ultima Handicap Chase. That still gives him something to find under another hefty burden here, however, and the top 10 is probably as good as it is likely to get. Some National runners tick all the right boxes. This one ticks several of the wrong ones, in particular a habit of throwing in a sloppy jump or three in most races. It surfaced again in the Cross Country Chase last month – which looks like one of the key pieces of form for this year’s race – as he unseated his jockey. The Aintree fences are not quite what they were, but clouting one or more can still be enough to cost you any chance of a win and this one is likely to be back among the also-rans. Going as well as the winner three from home last year but failed to see it out, finishing 27 lengths behind Minella Times. His finishing effort was also disappointing in the Bobbyjo Chase at Fairyhouse in February, form which gives him little chance of beating either Any Second Now or Escaria Ten. While Willie Mullins sees him as his No 1 contender, that probably says more about the relative weakness of his team this year. Another member of Elliott’s eight-strong stable , but one of the least convincing candidates to give her trainer a record-equalling fourth success. Stamina is unlikely to be an issue – she has looked to be crying out for a test like this for much of her career – but her jumping is generally so-so at best and comes with a tendency to veer sharply right. On a left-handed track like Aintree, that could cost her many lengths, and her latest run in the new Mares’ Chase at Cheltenham was a let down. Easily overlooked. Martin Brassil hit the bullseye with Numbersixvalverde, his first Grand National runner, in 2006, saddled the same horse to finish sixth a year later and then sent Double Seven to finish third in 2014. This is his first National runner since and won the ultra-competitive Thyestes Chase – a race that Numbersixvalverde landed the season before his Aintree win – in January, with several of today’s opponents well beaten. As an eight-year-old making just his seventh chase start, he has more scope for improvement than most and at around 16-1 is an excellent bet to further improve Brassil’s excellent record in the world’s most famous steeplechase. A live candidate to be the best of the British-trained runners, but even that would be no guarantee of an each-way return given the strength of the Irish challenge. The eight-year-old’s domestic form is rock-solid, however, and Colin Tizzard also resisted the urge to run him at Cheltenham, despite an excellent run in the Ladbrokes Trophy in November that could have persuaded him to aim at the Gold Cup. A sound jumper who goes on any ground, though his stamina is untested at a marathon trip and more dependable stayers can be backed at much the same price. Beaten less than two lengths in a Grade One race at Ascot last time, which is strong form for a horse getting weight from several of the major fancies. That was over two miles and five furlongs, however, and in addition to the question mark over his stamina, the fact he fell on his first attempt over these fences – in the Topham Trophy last season – is another concern. Kim Bailey, his trainer, knows what it takes to win this, having saddled Mr Frisk in 1990, but a price of around 40-1 looks fair. A top-class chaser at his best, who went down by a neck in the Cheltenham Gold Cup in March 2020. If he has been on the downslope of his career since, it has been a fairly gentle one. A change of scenery may have helped, having switched from Nicky Henderson to Polly Gundry over the summer, and he was up with the leaders for much of the way in last month’s renewal. One of several who could show up well for a long way if the fences fire him up, while unlikely to maintain his challenge beyond the second-last. Lauded as a potential all-time great when he ran up a sequence of wins as a novice hurdler in 2017/18, though Michael O’Leary, his owner, said at the time “he will never be as good as the hype will make out”. The 10-year-old has had his moments, including three Grade One wins and as Elliott points out, it “would be a Samcro thing to do” to “run a massive race”, but it would be a Samcro thing to finish 16th – as he did on his first start in a handicap chase – and that is the more credible scenario. Closely matched with Any Second Now on their form in the Bobbyjo Chase in February, when last year’s third gave 8lb to Elliott’s eight-year-old – 1lb more than he will on Saturday – and edged him by a nose. The time of that race was notably strong too, and a real step forward from Escaria Ten’s comeback run behind Longhouse Poet in the Thyestes Chase. He was probably feeling the effects of a big effort at Cheltenham when pulled up in last year’s Irish National and definitely makes the short list. Owners Isaac Souede and Simon Munir have four runners and their No 1 rider, Daryl Jacob, has opted to ride this one, though he remains a 33-1 outsider to give them a first National success. Won in the Rowland Meyrick Chase at Christmas, while a change of tactics from his usual front-running may be to blame for a lesser run last time. Unproven beyond three miles, has a fair bit to find with the market leaders and no obvious reason why he should bridge the gap going up in trip. Scraped in from second reserve a few minutes before the cut-off on Friday. Every National winner needs a bit of luck but Noel Meade’s gelding, who was pulled up after a bad mistake four out in the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir at Cheltenham last time, will need a whole lot more than that for his backers to get an each-way return. There are several heavyweight contenders in Elliott’s National squad, but Coko Beach fits more snugly into the bantamweight division. Seven-year-olds simply don’t win the National these days and while a win in last season’s Thyestes Chase is a plus, he was well beaten off a higher mark in the same race this season. Appeared to be running on fumes in a three-and-a-half mile race at Punchestown in February – and the National is another six furlongs. Emma Lavelle’s 10-year-old gets the nod for Best Outsider at around 40-1. His win in the Ladbrokes Trophy at Newbury in 2019 is one of the best individual pieces of form on offer in this year’s field. He will race off the same handicap mark and arrives on the back of an eye-catching run in February’s Denman Chase – his first start for 489 days after a tendon injury. Lavelle’s stable is a match for any when it comes to getting a top-notch horse big-race ready and it would be no surprise to see him outrun his odds. One of the better staying novice chasers in 2018/19, when he also won a handicap on the National undercard, but was off the track for 462 days before returning to action at Newbury in March. Has always looked likely to improve over a marathon trip but this is a swift return to action after a long break and he was among the potential rides that Daryl Jacob turned down. James Bowen gets the call-up, but his third National ride looks no more likely to prevail than the first two. Showed up well for a long way as a 16-1 shot last year and briefly threatened to do even better than his eventual finish in seventh when he moved towards the lead with four to jump. In the end, though, his finishing effort was tame, and even the veteran Blaklion managed to breeze past him on the run-in. His light schedule this year has clearly been designed with a return to Aintree in mind and co-owner Andrew Gemmell, of Paisley Park fame, has a happy knack of getting involved with fairytale success stories, but 40-1 does not feel unduly generous. Philip Kirby’s gelding should at least get a mention or two from the commentator as a confirmed frontrunner, but shout-outs at the business end will be more a lot more difficult to achieve. His first experience over these fences ended with a heavy fall at the 12th fence in the Becher Chase in December and even if that experience has not left a mark, his exuberant running style is likely to see his elastic band fully unwound with a few fences still to jump. Few trainers have as much to gain on Saturday as Ciaran Murphy, whose small stable would jump through several leagues if Enjoy D’Allen comes home in front. Murphy has been on the staff at Charlestown Stud for 25 years, but took over the licence 15 months ago and has already seen his eight-year-old run third in last season’s Irish National. That form gives him a big chance on Saturday, so much so that JP McManus was persuaded to buy a share after a solid prep run. “I’ve been thinking about nothing else all year,” he said recently. “Winning would be off the Richter scale.” Murphy’s gelding is a fair 14-1 shot to record a groundbreaking success. A top-class chaser in his day, who finished second in the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2019 and fifth – under top weight – behind Tiger Roll in the National a few weeks later. He also finished fourth on his first startin 2018, but was never going well when attempting to make it third time lucky last season. He has shown no more than occasional glimpses of worthwhile form since and while handicap runners from the Tony Martin yard have a reputation for dramatic improvement when the big day arrives, little short of a miracle is requiredfor him to make a mark this time. A change of surroundings made a world of difference to Sandy Thompson’s gelding, who seemed to have peaked as long ago as November 2018, when he was third in the Ladbrokes Trophy for Alan King, but has found a new lease of life in Scotland. Runner-up in the Scottish National last April, but yet to recapture that kind of form this year and he did not seem impressed by the Aintree experience in the 2020 Becher Chase. A worthy 66-1 shot. Already a history-maker having won the Irish National at 150-1 last year. Run Wild Fred and Enjoy D’Allen, who are at a much shorter price, finished second and third that day so a return to that level would – theoretically, at least – make him a player, but subsequent form suggests it was a flash-in-the-pan moment. Sheila Mangan, his owner, backed him at 50-1, 66-1 and then 150-1 – “ah, for feck sake, I have to have a bit of that as well” as she put it – and will presumably do so again now, but only optimists will follow her in. Finished 129 lengths behind Minella Times 12 months ago, when he arrived at Aintree in something approaching fair form, having made the frame in the Thyestes Chase earlier in the campaign. Has not come anywhere close to that level this year and Sam Twiston-Davies’s mount is rightly bracketed with the no-hopers at around 150-1. Snapped up by Robert Waley-Cohen in February as a National mount for his son, the leading amateur rider Sam. The Waley-Cohen colours have been carried to victory six times over the Grand National fences, but never, as yet, in the National. While Noble Yeats has bits of form to suggest he could be an Aintree horse one day, his debut is probably coming at least a year too soon. Lucinda Russell was the last British trainer to win the National, with One For Arthur five years ago, and her runner this year put down an excellent marker with a doughty success in the 2021 Scottish National, when making his sixth start over fences. He has failed to build on that and was reported to have suffered a breathing problem in the Edinburgh National in February. Better the further he goes, so the Aintree trip will hold no fears, but an immense leap of faith is required to back him on this year’s form. Set off as the much-fancied 11-2 favourite last year and was still chasing the leader five from home, but faded rapidly and was pulled up. A breathing problem was diagnosed and he had an operation to address it before returning to action this season, but the old Cloth Cap has yet to reappear. He looked like the best-handicapped horse in the field 12 months ago and is rated 1lb lower now at 25-1, but he found very little at the end of the Grimthorpe Chase at Doncaster last time. Charlie Longsdon’s mare has plenty of the attributes you look for in a winner, up to and including Hollywood blockbuster potential – she would be the first mum to win the race. Snow Leopardess gave birth to a filly foal during an 18-month absence from the track, but that is just one strand of a remarkable storyline involving her breeder, 80-year-old Marietta Fox-Pitt. “I wasn’t any different after I had children,” Fox-Pitt says when asked why she sent Snow Leopardess back into training, “so why should she be?” Recuperated with Marietta’s son, the event rider William Fox-Pitt and his wife, Alice Plunkett, part of the ITV Racing team, so her post-race interview has the potential to be teary TV gold. Odds of around 9-1 are short enough as she did not have a huge amount to spare at the end of the Becher Chase in December. Like Snow Leopardess, attempting to become the first mare to win the National since Nickel Coin in 1951. Unlike Snow Leopardess, she has very little chance of doing so and could well be the weakest link even in Mullins’s sub-par squad for this race. A late arrival in the field on Friday, moving up from first reserve. Unraced since an easy front-running win at Cheltenham in December, when none of his rivals could land a blow, but he is 9lb higher in the weights, will struggle to dominate a much better field and has been a weak finisher in the past. Has scraped in towards the bottom of the list after narrowly missing out in 2021, but seems to show his best form on heavy ground and also at right-handed Sandown Park. Left behind from around a mile out in the Welsh National in December and highly unlikely to fare much better in the even more demanding surroundings of Aintree. A former favourite for this race – running well to finish fourth– and Dan Skelton’s gelding has winning form over the National fences too, in the Becher Chase. That was all back in 2017, when Blaklion was a spry eight-year-old. It is 99 years since a teenager won the Grand National and it is more important than ever to have youth on your side these days. Easily overlooked. Won the Kerry National two seasons ago but had a year off in 2020/21 and has shown nothing in three starts in the current campaign. Form figures of 00P sum up his chance succinctly. Effectively “subbed” into the Elliott squad when the stable scratched Battleoverdoyen this week, creeping in at the foot of the weights. A dual Grade One winner and better the further he goes, so a fair chance of a top-10 finish if he rekindles his best form. Twenty-two lengths behind Snow Leopardess in the Becher Chase and little to no chance of reversing the form if his disappointing run in the Eider Chase at Newcastle last time is any guide. If you draw him in the sweep, have another go. The stress of the big race will be water off a duck’s back to connections after a nerve-shredding wait to see if their eight-year-old would get a run. It is a sign of how deeply competitive a modern National is that an easy winner of the Classic Chase at Warwick is struggling to make it in at the bottom of the weights. Now that he is confirmed as a runner, he will set off as one of the favourites. Followed up his Warwick success by running a cracker behind Win My Wings in the Eider and the winner there bolted up in last week’s Scottish National. Simply making it into the final field is an achievement for Henry Daly’s gelding, who was 67th on the original list of weights in February. Returned to winning form at Ascot last time but the ground simply can’t be heavy enough for him – it would have needed to start raining on Monday to give him any chance.

4/9/2022,"Rishi Sunak and his wife, Akshata Murty, had US green cards and were declared “permanent US residents” for tax purposes while Sunak served as chancellor. Sunak and Murty, who own a £5.5m Californian penthouse holiday home, held green cards while they lived in the US and continued to keep the status when they moved to the UK before Sunak was elected as MP for Richmond in North Yorkshire in 2015. Sky News first reported that Sunak continued to hold a green card for at least a year of his chancellorship, which began in 2020. The Treasury and Murty’s personal spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment. A source close to the couple said “they do not currently have green cards”, but would not say exactly when they gave up the status which requires holders to “make the US your permanent home”. The disclosure raises further awkward questions for the chancellor – who has said his multimillionaire wife had claimed non-dom status, which allows her to avoid UK tax on her foreign earnings, because she one day intended to return to live in India. Under non-dom rules, Murty does not legally have to pay tax in the UK on the estimated £11.5m in annual dividends she collects from her stake in her billionaire father’s IT business. The non-dom status may have allowed her to avoid up to £20m in UK tax. Murty has said she pays tax on the dividends overseas, but has refused to state how much she pays or in which country. She has previously collected other shareholder income via the tax haven of Mauritius, which does not tax dividends. Holders of green cards are required to pay US tax on their worldwide income – and also to make a legal commitment to “make the US your permanent home”. They are required to file annual US tax returns, and are “responsible for reporting your income and paying taxes on any foreign earned income”. Sunak earlier told the Sun that Murty “loves her country like I love mine”, and said she had always been domiciled in India. He said she was entitled to use the non-dom arrangement as she was an Indian citizen and planned to move back to her home country to care for her parents. Under non-dom rules, Murty pays £30,000 a year for the right not to pay UK tax on her overseas income. The status will automatically cease once she has resided in Britain for 15 years, a milestone it is understood she will reach in 2028. Sunak insisted that Murty pays all taxes due in the UK, “and every penny that she earns internationally, for example in India, she would pay the full taxes on that”. Critics pointed out that he said Murty “would pay” full taxes on overseas income, not that she had paid it or stated how much. They also said Sunak gave India only as an example, leaving open the possibility that Murty may have paid the tax in a tax haven where no taxes would have been due. Labour’s shadow attorney general, Emily Thornberry, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “In the end, we have somebody who’s been living here for eight years, raising her children here, living at … Downing Street in accommodation provided by the taxpayer and aspiring to be the wife of the next prime minister, and yet she says that she isn’t a permanent resident of this country.” She pointed to the ministerial code mentioning that the financial status of ministers’ spouses is relevant because “there can be a conflict of interest”.",News/Politics,Sunak and Murty held US green cards while he was chancellor,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/08/rishi-sunak-akshata-murty-us-green-cards
