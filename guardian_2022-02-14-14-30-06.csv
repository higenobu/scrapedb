2/14/2022,"A China-style internet gateway scheduled to be imposed in Cambodia this week would grant the government far greater powers to conduct mass surveillance, censor and control the country’s internet, rights groups have warned. Human rights experts and media advocates fear the gateway could be a step towards the kind of censorship enforced through China’s Great Firewall – though some question what technical capacity Cambodia’s systems currently have, and say the process has lacked transparency.  Under the changes, all online traffic must pass through a National Internet Gateway (NIG), which the government says will protect national security, help with tax collection and preserve “social order, culture and national tradition”. Rights experts say the internet is one of the few spaces that still allows for free expression, including criticism of the government of prime minister Hun Sen, who has been in power for more than three decades. Under his rule, the main opposition party has been outlawed, independent media severely curtailed and peaceful protesters have faced violence. Having stamped out dissent elsewhere, the government is now seeking to further expand its control over the online sphere, rights advocates have warned. “They want to have a hermetically controlled political environment where they are lord and master and anything they say goes - and anybody who objects gets sent to prison,” said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch. Internet service providers were required to reroute their traffic through the gateway by this week.The Cambodian government did not respond when asked about the timeframe for implementation, or the human rights concerns which have been raised. It has previously rejected comments by UN experts that the legislation is repressive, with the country’s Permanent Mission to the UN Offices in Geneva accusing the experts of making unfounded allegations and interfering in Cambodia’s domestic affairs. The authorities have increasingly taken steps to clamp down on online expression, including by jailing individuals over posts, messages and even music. Last year, at least 35 individuals were arrested, five had arrest warrants issued against them, and 21 were convicted for online posts, according to the Cambodian Centre for Human Rights (CCHR). Those targeted in recent years include the rapper Kea Sokun, who spent a year in prison after he was convicted of incitement in 2020 in relation to music he shared online; three activists belonging to the environmental group Mother Nature Cambodia, who had shared information on social media about plans to march to the prime minister’s house; and Kak Sovannchhay, the teenage son of an activist and opposition politician, who spent four-and-a-half months in pre-trial detention. Sovannchhay, who is autistic and was 16 at the time, had defended his father in comments made on Telegram, and shared Facebook posts critical of the government. The authorities have also found other ways to suppress online information, including ordering internet service providers to block certain pages, such as news sites. According to civil society groups, internet service providers have also slowed down the speed of the internet to disrupt their activities, including livestreams, while activists and media have faced localised power cuts. “It is therefore very likely that the NIG will become another instrument for the Royal Government of Cambodia to control and monitor the flow of information in Cambodia,” said Sopheap Chak, CCHR’s executive director. The gateway, she added, facilitates mass surveillance, the interception and censorship of digital communications, and the collection of personal data. Naly Pilorge, director of the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defence of Human Rights, said the enforcement of such a gateway would be devastating, and that it violated the constitution, as well as several conventions and treaties to which Cambodia is a signatory. “It would completely close off the ability of citizens to express themselves to share information. It would lead to even more of a closure in terms of civil society, in terms of activism in terms of issues that are affecting Cambodians,” she said.There are also concerns the system could slow down internet speeds, damaging business activity and foreign investment. Despite the looming deadline for implementation, there is little information about how the gateway will work, said Robertson. The Cambodian government might want to give the impression that it was introducing a China-style firewall, he added, but it was not clear if it had the capacity to do so. “There’s no clarity on how they’re doing this, what sort of form it is going to take, what sort of technology is being brought in,” he said. The law will, however, likely lead to a rise in self-censorship, just as the country prepares for commune elections in June, and a national election next year. “If you’re putting something up on the internet that is critical of the government, who knows maybe the NIG is coming to get you?” said Robertson",News/World news,Fears Cambodia is rolling out China-style ‘Great Firewall’ to curb online freedom,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/14/fears-cambodia-is-rolling-out-china-style-great-firewall-to-curb-online-freedom
2/14/2022,"A $400m mine expansion earmarked for approval by the New South Wales government would become the dirtiest thermal coal project in Australia, a public hearing has heard. Whitehaven Coal’s Narrabri underground expansion was incompatible with the state government’s 2030 climate targets and should be rejected, environment group Lock the Gate told the NSW Independent Planning Commission (IPC) on Monday.  The project will extend the mine’s life by 13 years to 2044 and increase the total coal mined from 170m to 280m tonnes. Nic Clyde, of Lock the Gate, told commissioners that Whitehaven’s extension was to an underground area to the south that would release high levels of the potent greenhouse gas methane. Clyde said the project would emit 1.36m tonnes of CO2-equivalent a year, making it the dirtiest thermal coalmine in Australia. Three other coalmines were dirtier, but they were mostly mining coal for use in steel making, he said. Almost all of those direct emissions occur from the release of methane when the coal is mined. A further 456m tonnes of CO2 would be released after the coal is sold and then burned. “This site is simply not a suitable location for a new coalmine expansion … it is not in the public interest, it’s not ecologically sustainable and it’s contrary to intergenerational equity,” said Clyde, who urged the commissioners to reject the project. Anatoli Smirnov, a coalmine methane analyst for London-based climate thinktank Ember, which is working with Lock the Gate, said methane was about 86 times more potent than CO2 over the first 20 years of its release. This very high near-term impact on the climate meant that reducing methane levels was crucial for meeting emissions reduction targets, he said. Smirnov pointed to Europe, where the European Commission is proposing a ban on venting and flaring methane from coalmines. When the NSW government backed the mine in a report in January, it said it would ask Whitehaven to prepare a plan to cut methane emissions and would set performance targets. Earlier in the IPC hearing, officials from the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment said they had recommended the project could be approved based on the department’s current policies. But they acknowledged the state’s climate policies were “rapidly changing” and that the work of the NSW advisory council on underground mining should be expanded to better cover greenhouse gas emissions as the world looks to limit global temperature rise. In the department’s report last month, senior officials stated NSW lacked clear and consistent policy to consider the impact of new developments on the climate crisis. The report said the project’s “benefits significantly outweigh its residual costs, and that it is in the public interest and is approvable”. The project would add about 20 new construction jobs, extend the 520 jobs at the existing mine and add $259m in royalties to the government. Clay Preshaw from the department told the hearing the project was a particularly gassy mine – a concern for fugitive emissions and it would require construction of extensive ventilation infrastructure, which would necessitate clearing of habitat. He said the department had proposed establishing a mechanism to review the mine’s emissions regularly and that such an approach could allow for a “ratcheting down” of emissions in line with current state government policy. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Several local residents and environmentalists expressed concern about the project’s impact on water and subsidence. Others backed the project, saying it would ensure the region’s prosperity. A second day of hearings is scheduled for Friday, with the government and Whitehaven Coal scheduled to address the commission. A statement from Whitehaven Coal said the NSW government had “clearly outlined that it sees an ongoing role for coal production as part of the global energy transition”. The company said it would “play our part” in cutting emissions and that the federal government’s plans related to net zero emissions “include a continuation of Australia’s coal and gas export industries to 2050 and beyond, recognising that net zero emissions does not mean zero emissions”. The commission is expected to make a decision no later than 20 May. Analysis from the Australian Conservation Foundation found NSW authorities have approved 23 new coal and gas projects with the potential to release 3bn tonnes of greenhouse gases since the start of the Paris agreement five years ago.",News/Environment,"Narrabri mine expansion would make it dirtiest thermal coalmine in Australia, environmentalists say",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/14/narrabri-mine-expansion-would-make-it-dirtiest-thermal-coalmine-in-australia-environmentalists-say
2/14/2022,"Vittorio Lai, nicknamed Pistol, still drives and hunts wild boar, and on Saturday became the latest person in Perdasdefogu, a remote mountain town on the Italian island of Sardinia that set a world record for longevity, to celebrate his 100th birthday. He will be joined this week by another sprightly centenarian, Piuccia Lai (no relation), who has no qualms about hopping on a plane to visit her sons in Milan, bringing the total number of over-100s in the town to 10 among a population of 1,765.  Sardinia has been identified as one of five regions in the world that have high concentrations of people who have eclipsed the century milestone. There are 534 people across the island who are 100 or older, or 33.6 for every 100,000 inhabitants. But Perdasdefogu, a town tucked high up in the rugged mountains of south-eastern Sardinia accessible only by a narrow, winding road, is unique in the sense that the number of centenarians in a town of its size is 16 times the national average. “The presence of 10 centenarians confirms the exceptional longevity of the inhabitants of Perdasdefogu, and moves the bar even higher,” said Luisa Salaris, a demographics professor at the University of Cagliari. Perdasdefogu shot to fame in 2012 when the Melis family, made up of nine brothers and sisters, entered the Guinness World Records as the oldest living siblings on Earth, with a combined age at the time of 818. The town’s longest-surviving citizen to date is Consolata Melis, the eldest of the siblings, who died in 2015, aged 108. Antonio Brundu, who turns 104 in March, is the current oldest resident. Vittorio Lai earned his nickname after killing his first wild boar at the age of 13. “I took my father’s rifle, the head of the hunting group,” he told the newspaper La Nuova Sardegna in an article written by historian Giacomo Mameli. “In those days, hunting freed the town from hunger.” The whole town ordinarily comes together to mark a 100th birthday, but owing to coronavirus restrictions, Lai celebrated by treating family and a few friends to lunch. He said he has worked “hundreds” of jobs over the course of his life. “I was a shepherd, a labourer, a warehouse worker and a cook, but without knowing how to cook.” His wife, Maria, is 97. “She wanted to become a nun,” said Lai. “And so I said: ‘OK then, I’ll become a priest or a friar.’” Piuccia Lai is celebrating her birthday on 21 February in Milan, where she will meet the mayor, Giuseppe Sala. “I’ve lived through hunger and war, during fascism and democracy, and voted as a woman for the first time on 2 January 1946,” she said. “I’ve met 10 popes, from Pius X to Bergoglio.” Several scientists have studied Perdasdefogu, with explanations for the town’s longevity ranging from clean air and active lifestyles to a diet containing plenty of fresh vegetables. Lai said he never leaves the table with a full stomach, eats little meat and drinks little coffee. For Mameli, the key is the town’s sense of community. “It’s close-knit; there are some exceptions, but we all love and look out for each other.”",News/World news,"‘I’ve met 10 popes, from Pius X to Bergoglio’: tiny Italian town sets record as 10th resident turns 100",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/14/10-residents-over-100-record-breaking-sardinia-town-perdasdefogu
2/14/2022,"New Zealand’s prime minister has warned that the country is entering a new phase of its pandemic response that is “like nothing we’ve experienced to date”, as case numbers begin to explode. “We are embarking for the first time in the two years since the start of the outbreak into a period where New Zealanders will see more Covid in the community,” Jacinda Ardern said on Monday.  “It is a period of disruption and, I know, of risk and will be like nothing we’ve experienced to date.” Ardern was speaking to reporters after a political reporter produced a positive rapid antigen test moments before the press conference. The empty seats in front of her – and the decision to forge on with the standup regardless – helped illustrate the new era for New Zealand, in which the government expects Omicron to reach every part of the country. New Zealand has been reporting near-daily record highs in case numbers, as infections begin to hit an exponential growth curve. On Monday, officials announced 981 cases in the community, up from previous all-time highs of 810 on Sunday and 454 the day before. The latest additions mean there are 4,960 active cases recorded across Aotearoa – but experts say the true number is likely much higher, given the lag in test results, and the fact testing is only advised for those with symptoms or who have been a direct contact of a case. On Monday the prime minister announced that the country would enter “phase 2” of its Omicron response – where home isolation times will be reduced, and it will rely more on contact tracing through the apps and online questionnaires, rather than investigations of each case by health officials. The latter is an admission that hands-on contact tracing is already reaching capacity – while the country has nearly 5,000 active cases from the last three weeks, the government has publicly listed only 135 locations of interest. Monday’s announcement follows regulations last week that will exempt key workers from isolating if exposed, as long as they return negative tests. The next phase is designed to try to carry the country through a period with extremely widespread cases, without having crucial workforces or supply chains paralysed by mass isolation. Ardern and director-general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said they were trying to avoid a “ping-mageddon” – the phenomenon similar to the “pingdemic” seen in the UK where so many people were simultaneously notified of being in contact with a Covid-positive person that workforces ground to a halt and many people stopped using the apps. Bloomfield said the country would no longer be requiring self-isolation for everyone who was in a Covid-positive location, nor would they necessarily be notified. “Where we put the effort will focus on places like age groups, dental care, corrections, facilities, places where there might have been the risk of a super-spreader type event … But we won’t be following up nor expecting people to isolate if they have, for example, been in a hospitality venue, just generally in that place [where another case was present].” The prime minister was questioned on how New Zealanders were dealing with the rapid rise in cases – and the mindset shift required after years dedicated to stamping every Covid case out. “My honest take is that New Zealanders are highly adaptable,” she said. “It’s a different phase, but I think New Zealanders are ready for it. I think they know that what we’re dealing with an Omicron – yes, we need to be vigilant, and we don’t want to be cavalier, but I think we also recognise it’s very different than the other stages of the pandemic and we have protections now that we didn’t have before.”",News/World news,"NZ Covid outbreak ‘like nothing we’ve experienced’, Ardern says, as cases skyrocket",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/14/nz-covid-outbreak-like-nothing-weve-experienced-ardern-says-as-cases-skyrocket
2/14/2022,"Anti-vaxxers in France are buying fake vaccine passes online to get around the country’s Covid restrictions, which are often promoted on mainstream social media platforms, research has revealed. Many buying the forgeries, which can be used across the European Union (EU), are being redirected from websites such as Instagram and Facebook to the Telegram encrypted messenger where they can be bought discreetly, according to a study by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD).  The report also raised concerns that social media algorithms are automatically directing people disillusioned with the French government’s handling of the pandemic towards far-right online spaces. ISD’s research coordinator, Zoé Fourel, who led the study, said that while some Facebook groups dedicated to the sale of fake Covid passes had about 1,000 members, there were Instagram accounts with as many as 17,000 followers. “I think, in terms of platforms, the main issue here is the scale to which this is available and with platforms such as Facebook and Instagram,” she said. “Obviously because they have such a wide audience, they are enabling this content on a larger scale. “For Instagram, one of the most alarming things we observed was that its algorithm is actually recommending accounts that are offering fake sanitary or vaccination services, so if you are a person who is following a couple of accounts with Covid disinformation or anti-vax content, your algorithm will recommend more accounts offering fake passes. “There is a really large issue here with the business model and the design of the platform and how it operates.” France introduced “health passes” during the coronavirus pandemic, which also allowed people to prove their status with a negative lateral flow test, as well as being vaccinated. But the French government last month gave approval for a vaccine pass that excludes unvaccinated people from restaurants, sports arenas and other venues. That has made acquiring a fake pass, which can be used across the EU member states, more desirable for anti-vaxxers, according to ISD. Fourel said: “These passes are valid across the EU, so we can see in, for example, a Telegram group that’s dedicated to European far-right movements and there are people selling fake passes. It really is a transnational issue. “You can be in Italy and sell a fake pass to French people and we have seen people from France being redirected in the comments section to Italian Telegram channels.” ISD is calling for more accountability for social media companies, including Snapchat, Meta – which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp – and Telegram, as well as legislation to protect users. Fourel said the upcoming application of the European Digital Services Act, which aims to tackle the spread of disinformation and illegal content, was “necessary”. She added: “When it comes to platforms, it’s quite clear that there needs to be more proactivity to take measures to counter the spread of this type of content because clearly, this does violate the policies that are upheld by them. “There also needs to be more proactivity on behalf of the French government.” Meta says it prohibits anyone from buying or selling fake, or genuine, medical documents on its platforms, including Covid vaccine certificates. It added that it would remove adverts when identified and disable any accounts, pages or groups that break its rules. The Guardian also contacted Snapchat and Telegram for comment.",News/World news,French anti-vaxxers buying fake Covid passes online,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/14/french-anti-vaxxers-buying-fake-covid-passes-online
2/14/2022,"The key Ambassador bridge trade link between Canada and the United States has reopened after police cleared the last Covid restriction protesters, ending a six-day blockade. Police moved in to clear and arrest the remaining protesters on the border bridge early on Sunday, trying to end one of the main demonstrations that have broken out across Canada against Covid-19 vaccine mandates and other restrictions to bring the pandemic under control.  After issuing warnings, police said arrests would be made and vehicles towed just after dawn near the bridge linking Detroit and the city of Windsor, Ontario. By Sunday afternoon, most protesters had gone and vehicles that were blocking the way had been removed, and the bridge reopened just before midnight on Sunday. “Today, our national economic crisis at the Ambassador Bridge came to an end,” Windsor’s mayor, Drew Dilkens, said. Television and social media images and clips showed officers detaining protesters and removing vehicles. The road is now effectively clear of protesters. A few hanging out in an adjacent parking lot, but that’s it. pic.twitter.com/D3moSZL0Ql Only two pickup trucks and fewer than a dozen protesters had been blocking the road to the bridge after numbers dwindled overnight and before police moved in. Afterward, police barricades remained. Crowd has thinned out at Windsor border protest. I count fewer than 70 people. @CBCNews @CBCWindsor pic.twitter.com/UWe3vZfJUa Police on Saturday had persuaded demonstrators to move their pickup trucks and others cars that they used at the entrance to the crossing that sees 25% of all trade between the two countries, though it remained closed. In the Canadian capital, Ottawa, meanwhile, small-scale protesting there swelled to what police said were 4,000 demonstrators. The city has seen that on past weekends, and loud music played as people milled about downtown where anti-vaccine demonstrators have been encamped since late January. The protests at the bridge and elsewhere have reverberated outside the country, with similarly inspired convoys in parts of France, New Zealand and the Netherlands, showing how small numbers can lead to huge disruption. The US Department of Homeland Security warned that truck convoys may be in the works in the US. An ex-cabinet minister in Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau’s government took the unusual step of calling out her former federal colleagues as well as the province and city for not putting an end to the protests. “Amazingly, this isn’t just Ottawa. It’s the nation’s capital,” Catherine McKenna tweeted. “But no one – not the city, the province or the federal government – can seem to get their act together to end this illegal occupation. It’s appalling. … Just get your act together. Now.” Trudeau has called the protesters a “fringe” of Canadian society. Ottawa police said in a statement late Saturday that a joint command center had been set up together with the Ontario Provincial Police and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. They said that would beef up enforcement capabilities that had been limited by “safety concerns – arising from aggressive, illegal behavior by many demonstrators – limited police enforcement capabilities”. Police earlier issued a statement calling the protest an unlawful occupation and saying they were waiting for reinforcements before implementing a plan to end the demonstrations. “The whole city is furious at being abandoned by the people who are supposed to protect us. They have completely abandoned the rule of law. @OttawaPolice have lost credibility. #OttawaPoliceFailed,” tweeted Artur Wilczynski, a senior government national security official at Canada’s Communications Security Establishment. Ottawa mayor Jim Watson declared a state of emergency last week for the capital, where hundreds of trucks remained in front of the Parliament buildings and demonstrators have set up portable toilets outside the prime minister’s office where Trudeau’s motorcade usually parks. Even after protesters’ vehicles were removed early Saturday, hundreds more arrived to bolster the crowd and settled into a face-off with police about two blocks away, waving flags and yelling. While there were no visible physical confrontations, the crowd still controlled the road to the bridge. On Friday, a judge ordered an end to the blockade of mostly pickup trucks and cars, and Ontario premier Doug Ford declared a state of emergency allowing for fines of C$100,000 and up to one year in jail for anyone illegally blocking roads, bridges, walkways and other critical infrastructure.

2/14/2022,"Independent federal MP Zali Steggall has defended a $100,000 donation from the family trust of former coal company director John Kinghorn which the Australian Electoral Commission found was not properly declared to comply with disclosure laws. The Sydney Morning Herald reported on Monday that a compliance review undertaken by the AEC found that a $100,000 donation made to Steggall’s Warringah campaign from the Kinghorn Family Trust was split into eight separate donations that were under the disclosure threshold of $13,800.  Kinghorn is the founder of Rams home loans and a former director of Cascade Coal and Felix Resources. According to the compliance report, the financial controller of Warringah Independent Ltd – the entity controlling Steggall’s campaign finances – advised AEC that the donation of $100,000 from the Kinghorn Family Trust consisted of eight individual donation amounts from Kinghorn family members. At the time, the financial controller of the Warringah campaign was Damien Hodgkinson, who is now a director of Simon Holmes à Court’s Climate 200 movement, which is supporting independent MPs prioritising climate action. “He [the financial controller] provided eight individual pledge forms and donation receipts generated by Warringah Independent Ltd to the Kinghorn family members,” the report said. “Notwithstanding the donation consisted of eight individual pledges, one cheque of $100,000 was given to Warringah Independent Ltd from The Kinghorn Family Trust.“Under the Electoral Act, the details of individual receipts exceeding the threshold must be disclosed in the annual disclosure return.” Steggall said she had received more than 1,700 individual donations ahead of the 2019 election and the eight individual pledges had come from a “large family living in my electorate”. “These are donations from a number of members of a large family who nearly all live in Warringah. If you ruled out taking donations from anyone who has invested in coal at one time or another, you pretty much rule out everyone as most people have through their superannuation,” Steggall said in a statement. “What is important is for people to now turn away from fossil fuel investment and support Australia’s transition to clean energy and support MPs with solutions.”Steggall has become a vocal advocate for greater action on climate change policy, including through the introduction of a private member’s bill that would establish an independent climate change commission and introduce risk assessment and adaptation plans to work towards carbon neutrality. Independent MP Andrew Wilkie, who is pursuing campaign donation reform through a private member’s bill to be moved on Monday, said there remained a pressing need for political donation reform in Australia. He said: “To that end, I moved a private member’s bill today that requires real-time disclosure, lowers the donation disclosure threshold to $1,000 aggregated, implements caps on donations and electoral expenditure, expands the definition of gift, and prohibits political donations from particular industries, including fossil-fuel entities, gambling companies, liquor companies and the tobacco industry.”",News/Australia news,"Zali Steggall defends $100,000 donation from coal investor, saying ‘most people have through super’",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/14/zali-steggall-defends-100000-donation-from-coal-investor-saying-most-people-have-through-super
2/14/2022,"The Morrison government is spending more than $31m on an advertising campaign claiming Australia is “making positive energy” under its leadership and cutting greenhouse gas emissions. A Senate estimates hearing on Monday was told a second stage of the advertising campaign, which began in December and runs until April, will cost $17.9m (plus GST). It follows $12.9m spent on the first stage which started last September.  The campaign, which includes advertisements across the web, billboards and broadcast, print and social media, says “it’s a fact” that “we’ve made good progress in reducing emissions and switching to renewable energy” and “we’ve got big plans for the future”. Its central claim – that the Australian government has a plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 – is widely disputed. The government plan, released before the Cop26 climate summit last year included no new policies, largely relied on unproven technology and did not actually map a path to the mid-century goal. Labor Senator Jenny McAllister asked departmental officials why the advertising did not explicitly mention climate change. Jo Evans, a deputy secretary from the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, said the absence “wasn’t deliberate on our part or any others. I don’t think there’s anything in that.” McAllister asked if the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, had any communication with the department about using the phrase “climate change”. Evans replied: “Not that I recall.” Helen Bennett, also from the department, told the hearing that spending on the program included $67,000 on focus group research to understand how people responded to the advertising. She suggested the results of the focus groups could not be released as they were part of a document before a cabinet subcommittee. Chris Bowen, Labor’s climate and energy spokesman, said the advertising campaign was evidence of the government “using taxpayer money as their own election campaign slush fund again”. “This time [it is] more than $30m on pre-election greenwash to advertise the success of renewables policies they tried to abolish,” he said. Bowen said the amount spent on advertising dwarfed the sum paid to consultants McKinsey & Company to model the impact of the Coalition net zero emissions plan, which estimates heard was about $6m. Taylor’s office was asked for a response. The ads claim that Australia is “rolling out rooftop solar at record levels”, “investing billions into projects like EV charging stations” and that national emissions are 20% below 2005 levels. All are true statements, but critics say the government has reduced support for renewable energy, backed fossil fuel expansion as part of its promised gas-fired recovery from the pandemic and offered less support for EVs than state governments. Government data shows the bulk of the national emissions reductions since 2005 happened when federal Labor was in power between 2007 and 2013, and was largely due to changes in forest and land clearing overseen by state governments. The hearings were also told that officials had revised the expected emissions from the development of the Beetaloo gas basin in the Northern Territory – backed by both the Coalition and Labor – since the last hearing four months ago. Then, it was 0.1m tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030. Last year’s national emissions projections increased the expected total to 4.9m tonnes between 2025 and 2030 as the basin is expanded with taxpayer support, with more expected beyond that date. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said it equated to the government admitting a 5,000% increase in expected emissions from fracking in the NT by 2030, with more to come after that date. “Neither the Coalition or Labor have accounted for Beetaloo emissions in their climate plans, despite both voting together to give public money to gas companies to subsidise this emissions bomb,” he said.",News/Media,Coalition spends $31m on ads spruiking efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/14/coalition-spends-31m-on-ads-spruiking-efforts-to-cut-greenhouse-gas-emissions
