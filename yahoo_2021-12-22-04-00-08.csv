12/22/2021,"Bill Gates posted a Twitter thread about the Omicron variant. The billionaire said he's canceled his holiday plans and is prepared for a rough few months. The pandemic could still end in 2022 if we take the right steps, like masking up and getting vaccinated. Bill Gates said he's canceled ""most""of his holiday plans due to the Omicron variant. ""Just when it seemed like life would return to normal, we could be entering the worst part of the pandemic,"" Gates wrote in a Twitter thread about the variant. ""Omicron will hit home for all of us. Close friends of mine now have it, and I've canceled most of my holiday plans,"" he continued. But the billionaire also said he believes the current wave of the pandemic will be over by March of next year because the new coronavirus variant spreads so quickly. Once Omicron moves through the population, we'll have an opportunity to recover from the winter surge. ""Those few months could be bad, but I still believe if we take the right steps, the pandemic can be over in 2022,"" he said. Other public health experts have predicted that Omicron will peak in January. The variant is spreading at an ""unprecendented"" pace, Dr. Anthony Fauci told Good Morning America Tuesday. But that speediness could eventually turn the tide against the virus. ""When you have something that goes up this quickly, often you see it come right back down,"" Fauci told GMA. ""Because what will happen is that either almost everyone is either going to get infected, particularly the unvaccinated, or be vaccinated,"" he said. Gates predicted that Omicron will soon ""be in every country in the world"" if it keeps spreading at this pace. At the time of publication, the variant accounts for 73% of all COVID-19 cases in the US. The billionaire warned that Omicron is not something to be taken lightly, especially when we don't yet know how much severe illness the variant will cause. ""We need to take it seriously until we know more about it,"" he wrote. ""Even if it's only half as severe as Delta, it will be the worst surge we have seen so far because it's so infectious."" Gates encouraged his followers to ""look out for each other"" by doing things like wearing masks, avoiding large gathering and indoor crowds, and getting the vaccine and booster shots. ""Someday the pandemic will end, and the better we look after each other, the sooner that time will come."" —Bill Gates (@BillGates) December 21, 2021 The Omicron variant is quickly spreading throughout the US and currently makes up nearly three-quarters of new cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

12/22/2021,"By Mark Trevelyan (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that Russia had no room to retreat in a standoff with the United States over Ukraine and would be forced into a tough response unless the West dropped its ""aggressive line"". Putin addressed the remarks to military officials as Russia pressed for an urgent U.S. and NATO response to proposals it made last week for a binding set of security guarantees from the West. ""What the U.S. is doing in Ukraine is at our doorstep... And they should understand that we have nowhere further to retreat to. Do they think we’ll just watch idly?"" Putin said. ""If the aggressive line of our Western colleagues continues, we will take adequate military-technical response measures and react harshly to unfriendly steps."" Putin did not spell out the nature of these measures but his phrasing mirrored that used previously by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who has warned that Russia may redeploy intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe in response to what it sees as NATO plans to do the same. Russia rejects Ukrainian and U.S. charges that it may be preparing an invasion of Ukraine as early as next month by tens of thousands of Russian troops poised within reach of the border. It says it needs pledges from the West - including a promise not to conduct NATO military activity in Eastern Europe - because its security is threatened by Ukraine's growing ties with the Western alliance and the possibility of NATO missiles being deployed against it on Ukrainian territory. Ukraine's President Volodymr Zelenskiy said on Friday that he was ready to meet Russia for ""direct talks, tête-à-tête, we don't mind in what format"". But Moscow has said repeatedly it sees no point in such a meeting without clarity on what the agenda would be. A Kremlin statement said Putin stressed in a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron that reconvening the four-power Normandy group - which brings together the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany - would require concrete steps by Kyiv to implement existing peace agreements. Ukraine says it is Russia and its proxies who are refusing to engage. With Western powers keen to show Russia they are solid in their support of Ukraine and NATO, Germany's new Chancellor Olaf Scholz also spoke by phone with Putin. U.S. SUPPLIES Karen Donfried, the U.S. State Department's top diplomat for Europe, in a briefing with reporters, said Washington was prepared to engage with Moscow via three channels - bilaterally, through the NATO-Russia Council that last met in 2019, and at the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. In the meantime, she said, the United States would continue to send military equipment and supplies to Ukraine in the weeks and months ahead - something that has antagonised Moscow. ""As President (Joe) Biden has told President Putin, should Russia further invade Ukraine, we will provide additional defensive materials to the Ukrainians above and beyond that which we are already in the process of providing,"" she said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance would seek meaningful discussions with Moscow early next year. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu alleged that more than 120 U.S. private military contractors were active in eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian troops have been fighting Russian-backed separatists since 2014, and said they were preparing a ""provocation"" involving chemical substances. He offered no evidence in support of the claim, which Pentagon spokesman John Kirby described as ""completely false"". Throughout the crisis, Russia has veered between harsh rhetoric, calls for dialogue and dire warnings, with Ryabkov repeatedly comparing the situation to the 1962 Cuban missile crisis when the world stood on the brink of nuclear war. Many of its demands, including for a block on NATO membership for Ukraine and the withdrawal of U.S. and other allied troops from Eastern Europe, are seen as non-starters by Washington and its partners. But rejecting them out of hand would risk closing off any space for dialogue and further fuelling the crisis.

12/22/2021,"An employee stole $154 million from Sony Life Insurance Company in Tokyo in May. The employee then converted the funds to bitcoin, now worth more than $180 million. Law enforcement has since seized the bitcoin and is working to return funds to Sony. The US Justice Department is trying to return more than $150 million that was embezzled from a Sony subsidiary and converted into bitcoin. In May, a worker at Sony Life Insurance Company in Tokyo allegedly diverted $154 million to a personal account at a Southern California bank when the company was instead trying to transfer the funds between financial accounts, according to a Monday press release from the US Justice Department. The worker, identified as Rei Ishii, then converted the money to bitcoin, the release said. Law enforcement from the US and Japan eventually found the ""private key,"" or password, to the bitcoin address that held the 3,879 bitcoin tokens — now worth more than $180 million — and seized the funds on December 1. As of Monday, the US had filed a civil forfeiture complaint in the Southern District of California to protect Sony's interest in the stolen property. ""Criminals should take note: You cannot rely on cyptocurrency to hide your ill-gotten gains from law enforcement,"" Acting U.S. Attorney Randy Grossman said in the statement. The Justice Department said it received ""significant assistance"" from Sony and Citibank and investigated the matter alongside multiple Japanese agencies, which enabled the US to uncover the crime. The US Justice Department has been chasing other crypto crimes as well. Last month, the agency announced it would sell $56 million worth of crypto seized in the BitConnect scheme, in which promoters swindled thousands of people out of about $2 billion worth of bitcoin in 2017.

12/22/2021,"At least one person is dead after an airplane collided with a paraglider and crashed near Houston, according to police. The small plane — a single-engine Cessna 208 — went down in Fort Bend County at 9:40 a.m. on Tuesday, Dec. 21, the FAA said in a news release.
