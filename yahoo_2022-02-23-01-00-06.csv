2/23/2022,"By Lawrence Hurley WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday brought a formal end to former President Donald Trump's request to block the release of White House records sought by the Democratic-led congressional panel investigating last year's deadly attack on the Capitol by a mob of his supporters. The court's decision to formally reject Trump's appeal follows its Jan. 19 order that led to the documents being handed over to the House of Representatives investigative committee by the federal agency that stores government and historical records. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Dec. 9 upheld a lower court ruling that Trump had no basis to challenge President Joe Biden's decision to allow the records to be handed over to the House of Representatives select committee. Trump then appealed to the Supreme Court Trump and his allies have waged an ongoing legal battle with the House select committee seeking to block access to documents and witnesses. Trump has sought to invoke a legal principle known as executive privilege, which protects the confidentially of some internal White House communications, a stance rejected by lower courts. The House committee has said it needed the records to understand any role Trump may have played in fomenting the violence that unfolded on Jan. 6, 2021. His supporters stormed the Capitol in a failed bid to prevent Congress from formally certifying Biden's 2020 presidential election victory over Trump. The committee asked the National Archives to produce visitor logs, phone records and written communications between his advisers. Biden, who took office two weeks after the riot, previously determined that the records, which belong to the executive branch, should not be subject to executive privilege.

2/23/2022,"Three men convicted of murdering Ahmaud Arbery have been found guilty in a federal hate crimes trial. Travis McMichael, Gregory McMichael and their neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan were all convicted of felony murder and other charges in November. The jury was made up of eight White people, three Black people and one Hispanic person. Arbery was shot and killed in Brunswick, Georgia, in February 2020. Cellphone video of the incident showed the McMichaels chasing Arbery as he jogged through the  neighborhood. The two men cornered the 25-year-old with their pickup truck before Travis McMichael shot Arbery with a shotgun. Bryan helped chase Arbery and recorded the shooting on his cellphone. The incident sparked national outrage, as did the fact that the three suspects were not arrested until two months after Arbery's death. In closing arguments Monday, the prosecution told the jury that the three defendants were driven by ""racial assumptions, racial resentment and racial anger."" Defense lawyers argued that the pursuit of Arbery was not racially motivated, but a result of their belief he was involved in criminal activity. At their state trial last fall, Travis McMichael was convicted of the highest count, malice murder, and all three were convicted of felony murder and other charges. The McMichaels were sentenced in January to a minimum of life in prison, while Bryan has the possibility of parole in 30 years. The three men were also charged with federal hate crimes, which included using force and threats of force because of Arbery's race to intimidate and interfere with his right to use a public street. Before the beginning of their second trial, the McMichaels tried to enter a plea deal, which would have allowed them to serve time in federal rather than state prison. However, the judge rejected the deal after Arbery's parents opposed it, prompting the McMichaels to withdraw their pleas and sending the case to trial. During the trial, their defense attorney said they did not commit a hate crime, arguing they did not target Arbery because he was Black but simply used their authority to chase him because they suspected he was committing crimes in the neighborhood. However, an FBI witness testified in court last week that records from Travis McMichael's and Bryan's phones revealed the repeated use of racial slurs. Travis McMichael also allegedly advocated violence against Black people, while Bryan exchanged racist messages on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Gregory McMichael's phone was encrypted, but the witness alleged that he posted a meme on Facebook in 2016 saying White Irish slaves were treated worse than any race in the U.S. but that the Irish aren't asking for handouts. Their defense attorneys argued such comments were not proof of a hate crime. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, told ""CBS Mornings"" in January that she rejected the idea of plea deal because she wanted the men to stand trial for hate crimes. ""I think that the federal charges are just as important as the state charges and I think that they need to stand trial for those charges as well,"" Cooper-Jones said.  ""Ahmaud is a kid you cannot replace,"" his father, Marcus Arbery, said outside the courthouse in January. ""He was killed racially and we want 100% justice, not no half justice.""

2/23/2022,"Billionaire investor Mark Cuban suggested market reactions to Russia-Ukraine tensions might be exaggerated. ""Markets always overreact and overcorrect to news, or anticipated news, particularly after a big run-up,"" he told Fox Business on Monday. Cuban said investor worries about Fed rate hikes are overblown, and there aren't many other good places to get good returns. ""Shark Tank"" investor Mark Cuban downplayed the chances of Russia's escalating crisis with Ukraine driving investors out of financial markets in the long term, saying they don't have much of an alternative if they want good returns. Stocks around the world have fallen in bumpy trading in recent days, swayed by developments in the Russia-Ukraine situation. Asked about the effect of those geopolitical events, Cuban suggested it was just the normal run of action. ""Markets always overreact and overcorrect to news, or anticipated news, particularly after a big run-up because speculators and investors want to protect their profits. So people run to cash,"" he told Fox Business' Neil Cavuto in a Monday interview. Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized two breakaway territories in south-eastern Ukraine as independent states on Monday, and ordered Russian troops to enter the country for what Moscow described as a ""peacekeeping"" operation. US stock markets have fallen in the early months of 2022 as investors nervously assessed the prospect of a more hawkish Federal Reserve making a series of interest-rate hikes to cool inflation. If the Fed raises interest rates by 25 basis points for nine consecutive meetings, as JPMorgan expects, the benchmark US rate would go from its current record low of 0%-0.25% to 2.25%-2.5% in less than a year. Rate hikes encourage companies to cut back on spending, which means they are investing less into the business. That weighs on their earnings potential, which ends up hurting share prices. Cuban said even though investors may now be holding back from investing in financial markets, due to worrying too much about rising rates, they will return. ""But the reality is, whether rates go to 3% or 4%, there aren't a lot of other good places to put your money,"" he said. ""And so, while there may be a lull now — just like we've seen in the past — people will come back to the markets."" If Western governments do go ahead with harsh sanctions, and there's a further deterioration in Russia and Ukraine's situation, Goldman Sachs predicts the benchmark S&P 500 index could tumble another 6%. The investment bank also expects the tech-heavy Nasdaq to fall 9.6%, and Europe's continent-wide Stoxx 600 to drop 9.3%.

2/23/2022,"Zelenskiy spoke after Russia's decision to formally recognise two Moscow-backed regions of eastern Ukraine as independent and send troops to the region, accelerating a crisis that the West fears could unleash a major war. After chairing a security council meeting, Zelenskiy accused Russia of violating Ukraine's sovereign territory and said it could mean Moscow pulling the plug on the Minsk peace talks aimed at ending the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine. Zelenskiy said Ukraine wanted to solve the crisis through diplomacy but that his country was ready to dig in for the long haul. ""Ukraine definitely qualifies actions of the Russian federation as a violation of the integrity in sovereignty of the territory of Ukraine. All the responsibility for the consequences of these decisions rests on the political authorities of Russia. Recognition of the independence of the occupied regions of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions means unilateral withdrawal of the Russian Federation from the Minsk agreements and disregard of the decisions made in Normandy format. This jeopardises all peaceful efforts and destroys present formats of negotiations.""",Politics/Reuters Videos,"Russia has destroyed peace efforts, says Zelenskiy",https://news.yahoo.com/russia-destroyed-peace-efforts-says-035118015.html
