12/27/2021,"An Afghan former BBC journalist who managed to flee the Taliban has been stranded in a refugee camp for months because of delays to a resettlement scheme promised by the UK government. Mudassar Kadir* is the only one of a group of 14 former BBC employees to have escaped Afghanistan since the Taliban took over in August. The other 13 remain in hiding in fear of their lives.  Kadir, who also spent time working for the World Bank and the former Afghan government, had hoped that he and his family could begin a new life after leaving Afghanistan. But since escaping in early October with the help of a US charity, Kadir and his wife and two young sons have been stuck in a refugee centre on the outskirts of Dubai. The Kadirs are grateful to the United Arab Emirates for the safe haven and are being well looked after. But they are prevented from straying any more than 100m from the building and the UAE will not accept asylum applications. Kadir is exasperated by the UK government’s repeated refusals to his request for help. And he still lives in fear of being sent back to Afghanistan where his work for the BBC has made him a target for the Taliban. He said: “The UK should have a duty of care to me and my family. My life is at risk because I have worked for the BBC. The UK government knows this but they have done nothing to help me. “In the beginning we hoped that the UK would give me a visa, but now with each passing day my frustration grows.” Campaigners say the family’s predicament highlights the plight of thousands of Afghan immigrants who are currently caught in limbo – unable to return home for fear of persecution and prevented from travelling anywhere willing to grant them refugee status. In January the UK government has promised an Afghan citizens’ resettlement scheme (ACRS) to help up to 5,000 people a year, alongside the existing more restrictive Afghanistan relocation and assistance policy (Arap) for Afghans who worked for the UK government during the occupation. Kadir does not qualify for Arap, which has helped fewer than 400 people so far, and he cannot apply for ACRS because it is yet to open and when it does will only accept referrals for resettlements by NGOs. Campaigners fear the UK government is deliberately delaying the implementation of the scheme in a bid to reduce numbers. The Home Office denies this. A spokesperson said: “The ACRS is one of the most generous schemes in our country’s history and will give up to 20,000 further people at risk a new life in the UK. “We continue to work at pace to open the scheme amid a complex and changing picture, working across government and with partners such as UNHCR to design the scheme.” It refuses to discuss individual cases. When asked to explain the delay, the Home Office says it is working on a system of “biometric enrolment” and eligibility checks to ensure those accepted do not pose a threat to national security. But the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, which is representing Kadir and many others in the same predicament, says time is running out. Its interim chief executive, Minnie Rahman, said: “Three months ago, our government promised a ‘warm welcome’ to Afghan refugees but increasingly it seems that there’s precious little welcome to be found. “Like Kadir, many Afghans appear to have been shamefully abandoned by the British government, despite clear links to the UK. The resettlement scheme is still not open, family reunion routes are still extremely limited and our government seems unable to offer many who risked their lives working with us the refuge they so urgently need.” The National Union of Journalists has been lobbying the government to help to secure visas for all the Afghan former BBC staff, including one who survived an armed attack on a relative’s home in October. Its general secretary, Michelle Stanistreet, said: “Whilst progress on the resettlement process happens at a snail’s pace, journalists affected are living in fear and being forced into hiding. We need urgent and robust measures put in place to secure safe passage to the UK for all those Afghans at such high risk.” A spokesperson for the BBC said: “We have every sympathy with former staff, but we regret we are not in a position to extend our direct support to them.” Kadir said: “My hope is that the UK government will fulfil their commitment towards me and my family. But right now it seems no one is paying attention to my case. Since arriving in the UAE two months ago there has been zero progress.” * His name has been changed ",News/World news,Afghan ex-BBC journalist stranded for months due to Home Office scheme delays,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/27/afghan-ex-bbc-journalist-stranded-for-months-due-to-home-office-scheme-delays
12/27/2021,"Energy bosses will hold emergency talks with the government on Monday after record high gas prices last week refuelled calls for an urgent intervention to avert “an enormous crisis” in the year ahead. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, is expected to lead a virtual meeting of energy company chief executives to address fears that the ongoing winter energy crisis may escalate following new price highs across Europe last week.  Stephen Fitzpatrick, chief executive of energy supplier Ovo, told the BBC there had been “nowhere near enough urgency” from the government, even as soaring wholesale costs threatened “an enormous crisis for 2022”. Gas prices surged last week to 450p a therm, around nine times higher than a year ago, surpassing the record high set in October this year as supplies from Russia slowed despite rising demand to beat the winter cold. “We’ve seen this energy crisis unfold now for the last three months and we’ve watched as energy prices have spiked, fallen back, and spiked again,” Fitzpatrick said. “We’ve had more than 30 bankruptcies in the sector, we’ve had millions of customers forced to change supplier. The cost to the consumer has already been more than £4bn.” He added: “We haven’t seen any action from the government or from the regulator. There’s an acceptance that there’s a problem, but nowhere near enough urgency to find a solution.” Nigel Pocklington, the chief executive of supplier Good Energy, told investors last week that “no one in the industry is immune” to the surge in market prices, and called on the government to “support the industry at large in navigating these short-term challenges to protect bill-payers and those that serve them”. “This is a national crisis,” Pocklington said. “Wholesale gas and power prices have increased to unprecedented levels over the last three weeks, creating an extremely difficult operating environment for every business in the industry.” Energy bosses are expected to call for the government to offer help to hard-hit households by cutting VAT from bills, and moving green support levies into general taxation. They are also expected to discuss new ways to manage the cost of energy company failures, which has affected millions of households since September. The government also faces growing calls from opposition parties to take action against the energy crisis, which has caused the steepest ever winter bill hike in October and is likely to lead to even larger increases in April when the regulator is due to reset its energy price cap. The Liberal-Democrats have calculated that households are likely to pay a total of £100m more for their gas and electricity between Christmas and New Year compared to last year. Ed Davey, the party’s leader, said the government had “totally failed to tackle the problem” and called on ministers to double the financial help offered through the warm home discount scheme. Ed Miliband, Labour’s shadow energy minister, called on the government to stop families being “clobbered” with the increased cost of heating and powering their homes, by removing VAT on bills for six months. A similar plan is in place in Spain which has cut energy taxes, and in Germany which has slashed green levies on household bills. The Labour party has calculated that the surge in home energy bills is likely to have handed the Treasury a “windfall” of £3.1bn since October’s budget, which would more than offset the £2.4bn impact of removing VAT from heating bills over the winter period to help hard-pressed families. However, the Treasury said higher energy bills could mean that households reduce their spending on products and services which face a higher rate of VAT meaning an overall reduction in revenues.",News/Business,Energy bosses to meet Kwasi Kwarteng in attempt to avert ‘enormous crisis’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/27/energy-bosses-to-meet-kwasi-kwarteng-in-attempt-to-avert-enormous-crisis
12/27/2021,"This New Year’s Eve could be the mildest on record with temperatures as high as 15C, the Met Office has said. The prediction comes after parts of the UK had a white Christmas, with snowfall in Yorkshire and Scotland.  Low pressure systems moving across the Atlantic were driving the change, bringing in milder air and wet weather, the Met Office said. Forecasters had said the previous New Year’s Eve record of 14.8C (58.6F) in 2011 could be matched or even surpassed in parts of the UK. Met Office meteorologist Greg Dewhurst said: “The record is 14.8C on New Year’s Eve and that was in 2011, temperatures look like they’ll be 14C to 15C (57.2F-59F) so it is possible that temperatures could be that value,” he said. Dewhurst said the weather throughout the week will be “on the mild side”. “We’re going to see across the whole of the country, through the rest of this week, temperatures that are above average for this time of year,” Dewhurst said. “The average temperature in the UK around this time of year should be around 7C-8C (44.6F-46.4F). “Going forward, we’re looking at highs of around 12C-14C (53.6-57.2F), possibly locally 15C in one or two spots, so it’s going to be well above average.” “It isn’t going to be blue skies all week,” Dewhurst added. “There’s going to be cloud at times as well as strong winds and heavy rain, particularly across the north and the west of the UK.” He said there were no weather warnings in place, but parts of the UK would be hit by gale force winds later in the week. “Gales are possible at times in the south and the west as we move through the week,” he said.",News/UK news,"New Year’s Eve could be mildest on record in UK, says Met Office",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/27/new-years-eve-could-be-mildest-on-record-in-uk-says-met-office
12/27/2021,"The actor Paul Bettany has spoken for the first time about having the text messages exchanged between himself and Johnny Depp concerning Amber Heard read out at Depp’s libel trial. Bettany, who is currently promoting A Very British Scandal, told the Independent it was “a really difficult subject to talk about” and said he was concerned doing so would “just pour fuel on the fire”.  “Can you imagine what it would be like, honestly, to have a bunch of lawyers go through every one of your emails and texts for 10 years? All I can tell you is that it was an unpleasant feeling.” A series of aggressive and unpleasant texts exchanged between Bettany and Depp, his friend and sometime co-star, were read aloud in court in 2020 by barristers for News Group International, which Depp was suing after a column by Dan Wootton in the Sun referred to him as a “wife beater”. One message, sent in 2013, made lewd reference to Heard’s “beaver”, and discussed her murder by “burning” or “drowning”. “I’m not sure we should burn Amber,” wrote Bettany. “She is delightful company and pleasing on the eye. We could of course do the English course of action and perform a drowning test. Thoughts? You have a swimming pool.” Depp replied: “Let’s drown her before we burn her!!! I will fuck her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she’s dead.” To which Bettany apparently wrote back: “My thoughts entirely. Let’s be certain before we pronounce her a witch.” Depp was asked in court whether Bettany was one of his “drug buddies”, and he said that the pair had taken drugs together and drunk alcohol. Depp lost the libel case and was replaced by Mads Mikkelsen in the forthcoming third instalment of JK Rowling’s Fantastic Beasts movie franchise. Bettany has won plaudits for his performance as the Duke of Argyll in A Very British Scandal, as well as in Marvel spin-off WandaVision.",Arts/Film,Paul Bettany: having Johnny Depp texts read aloud in libel trial was ‘an unpleasant feeling’,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/27/paul-bettany-johnny-depp-text-messages-read-libel-trial
12/27/2021,"It seems like only yesterday that we were all enjoying the memes and videos parodying the decline and fall of Matt Hancock. The incredible brevity of his time in exile seems to strain the laws of PR physics, and suggests that the fallen minister still enjoys support at the highest levels of government. A hasty press call, a mea culpa in front of a bush: his resignation speech was haphazardly choreographed. The time-compressed media age seems to have eaten away our powers of recall. Public figures are sacrificed daily to the gods of Twitter. News items that, at their peak, command the collective consciousness quickly disappear (Remember wallpaper-gate? I don’t).  The idea of penance – time spent away from ordinary life in repentance for one’s sins – exists in all major religions. The Indian spiritual leader Meher Baba said: “When penance is carefully practised, it inevitably results in the revocation of undesirable modes of thought and conduct, and makes one amenable to a life of service.” Different faiths prescribe differing levels of self-sacrifice according to the seriousness of the sin. Hancock, for his part, has spent a mere six months as a backbencher, and is reported to have also stayed in an £87-per-night hotel in Montreux. Is this enough time to atone for the grope that shook the cabinet? The great expenses scandal of 2009 for ever eroded the idea of politicians as highly credible public servants, replacing it with the image of Sir Peter Viggers’ duck house. We are far from the days of the John Profumo affair, when scandal could truly bring down a politician. Hancock would never be content tending a market garden in Norfolk. The world has changed a great deal. Paradoxically, though online platforms are where he received the most ridicule, it is the range of tools that social media makes available that will enable Hancock to ascertain his best route forward. Having conviction, staying fast and loose with messaging, and saturating the media with his rehabilitated smile will – in my honest opinion – be enough to bring him back into the fold of mainstream politics. Hancock’s affair may soon be a dimly remembered peccadillo in the Tory annals. Gone are the days when a high-profile public figure outed by a red top could buy time in the Priory. Sentiment analysis can help decide between a social media post of toad-licking and a beautiful desert sunset, to see which resonates with the public and best says “I’ve rebooted my life via an out-of-body hallucinogenic experience”. Carefully measured clicks will decide Hancock’s fate. But who is behind this resurrection? Given the current cabinet’s churn, it would not be surprising if Boris Johnson were trying to expedite the rehabilitation of one of his loyal generals. Even with the prime minister as backer, full recovery will require Hancock to believe unflinchingly in his own fitness and purpose. The swiftness and intensity of Hancock’s comeback demonstrates he has the self-belief necessary. Today’s “dispersed” media will give Hancock’s camp one great benefit: it will allow him to stress-test a number of options. Part of this exercise will be gauging the strength of the hostility against him; the response will shape his strategy. Already you see different tones being trialled, the triumphant, the grovelling (apologetic tones on the BBC and Times Radio) and the scrappily indignant (tense and defensive on Peston on 1 December). The right cocktail – in combination with a charity campaign, such as that he is running on dyslexia awareness – will suffice to ensure no path is barred to him. He could even become prime minister. For the plucky media strategist, success has the potential to become the story itself; if there is one thing comms folk love, it’s a challenge of Hancockian proportions. Yet, they won’t necessarily do it for free. Whoever is supporting the return of Hancock will anticipate future rewards. Success depends on whether Hancock can still play ball. For all the PR advice one can buy (or source from party ranks), the success or failure of his rehabilitation will ultimately depend on whether he can regain his footing and project effectiveness as a politician. In all faiths, penance is meant to result in a personality reset, returning the individual from a life of arrogance and sin to one characterised by humility. Public servants stumble. Whether they recover or not is more than just a matter of convincing others they have changed – it is about taking what you learned in the desert to heart.

12/27/2021,"When my older brother died, the first thing I thought about was work. I had just moved to New York from London, so my family had to break the news over the phone, grappling with my grief while still sucker-punched by their own. But if you had asked me at that moment, I would have told you there was no grief. Instead, I immediately began thinking about which editors I was going to have to let down. What work might fall by the wayside for ever? I quickly calculated the upsides of my “time off”. At least I would have more time to spend on that long article that was due. Then I thought about going for a run. Or shouting at somebody. Mostly, I thought about getting off the phone. It was all an inconvenience. Had my family – always so keen to remind me of where I had come from and who I was never going to get to be – just passed on this news to ruin my day?  I should probably have been thinking about how my brother and I fought relentlessly, but how he always thought he was trying to protect me. How he would turn up at every family celebration with three dozen Ferrero Rochers in hand. How he was the life and soul of every party I had. But these leaps and twists of my mind, to escape a horrible truth, reflected a mental agility I had learned in childhood. When I ended up estranged from my parents and homeless at 16, I reframed it as “moving out”. When I worked multiple jobs to cover rent in London in my 20s, I told people: “It’s so crazy how having less time makes you more organised! It’s like you have more time!” Dad taught me an exceptional work ethic – he still works six‑day weeks and 16-hour days – something I now realise is due to generational trauma. He fled Bangladesh with his family in the 60s searching for prosperity, only to arrive in a UK that was rife with racism. Yet he never gave up the dream, telling us every day that if we wanted to escape poverty, we needed to work hard. For me, that mantra turned into a compulsion. I started to believe that if I didn’t work hard enough, bad things would happen and I would have only myself to blame. During high school exams, I prepared obsessively for every possible essay question, sticking revision notes on the walls of my homeless shelter, as if they were posters of boybands. I finished that year with near-perfect grades. I had conditioned my body to believe that I could work myself into the ground to escape every trauma, upset and obstacle life threw at me. Then came my brother’s death. In the hours after I received the news, reality set in. I held on to the kitchen counter, walking like a cat, low to the ground from fear. I felt the world unsteady beneath my feet. I called my friends to tell them I didn’t know if I was sitting or standing. “I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know,” I responded to every question. I was in shock. I howled in pain at the life-shattering confusion that came from realising that the big brother I knew would now exist only in photographs – aged five, wearing a Mickey Mouse T-shirt – and in a video on my phone, surprising his best friend with a fridge full of sweets and chocolate. Yet still I tried, after one day in bed, to “snap out of it”. I went out for a bagel. I met a new person in the city and apologised when, less than an hour in, I started to cry uncontrollably. I flew back to London to see my family, screamed at my boyfriend, went to the funeral, then returned to work two weeks later. I was told to take as much time as I needed. But the job in New York was a dream job. Walking through a farmers’ market the day after I had first landed, picking out fresh vegetables and lamb sausages, I had felt as if I had finally escaped. So, when the life-upending phone call came the next day, it felt like a premonition: my old life was trying to catch me again. I felt a familiar compulsion to outpace it. Bosses don’t wait for you to get back on your feet, my dad told me. This time, however, my tank was empty. No matter how much I willed myself to get up and carry on as normal, my body and my mind resisted. I walked out of meetings to cry in the bathroom. Some days I came in and turned around as soon as I got to work. Sometimes I couldn’t get out of my bed at all. One day, standing outside our office in Manhattan, telling my boss I didn’t need to go home when clearly I did, I confessed. “I just don’t want it to defeat me,” I told her. “Well,” she said. “It’s going to beat the shit out of you if you don’t confront it.” When I finally went to a therapist, she confirmed the worst. There was no running from this one. Of course, I tried to argue. I tried to explain a black hole had been chasing me my whole life, that it had chased me out of my home and then across the Atlantic. I told her how it waited around after bad events, promising to suck me back to my old life if I let my guard down. If I didn’t run now, I would soon be homeless again, living on 3p noodles and washing in a bucket in my bedroom. She suggested, gently, that perhaps the reason I couldn’t run any more was because I didn’t have to. What if my body was letting me stay still because I was finally safe, because I had a job that would grant me the time off I desperately needed, a liveable wage that would pay my bills, a partner on whom I could rely? Maybe, she said, I was no longer the 16-year-old living in hostels who would lose everything if she didn’t stop running. I didn’t believe her, but what choice did I have? The sadness was there, my therapist told me; I was just choosing not to look at it. So I tried. I still worked obsessively – old habits die hard – but on days when I was stricken with grief I asked to work from home, or to take a few hours off. I stopped filling my social calendar with events that helped me avoid having to think about what haunted me. I stopped drinking so much and spent more time alone. When I was homeless, I used to avoid the hostel’s TV room. I hated trying to relax in a communal space full of people I didn’t know, pretending it was a home. I didn’t like the attention, or the idea of having to fight over a remote with a fake family. But in my mind, I had reframed this: I told myself that I was so busy that if I watched TV, I would never get anything else done. Now, in the hours when I could no longer force on a happy face, the TV became my best friend. I became acquainted with shows I had never watched: Breaking Bad, The Wire, Girls and The Sopranos. I watched films – and learned that many include a scene in which a brother dies. I cried a lot. I learned that my disposition to run away was a result of trauma, that it left some people feeling like passengers in my life, rather than people invited along for the ride. I learned I was destructible. Finally unable to find a silver lining, I learned that the bad things that happened in my life were neither a test nor a triumph, just unpleasant things that I wished had never happened. With that, I grew around my grief. I learned that no amount of work would prepare me for, nor relieve me from, difficult things – including my brother not being here. I learned that, on some days, I would still find myself blindsided by a memory of him while doing the shopping, or in the middle of a meeting, or during a conversation not related to him at all. In those moments, I learned, I didn’t need to run from the memory. I could just stay still.

12/27/2021,"Ministers have been warned that their efforts to tackle Britain’s obesity crisis are likely to fail because the public are constantly “bombarded” by unhealthy food options. Britain has one of the highest obesity rates in Europe, with two in three adults overweight or obese and the NHS spending £6bn a year treating obesity-related ill-health, a figure that is forecast to rise to £10bn a year by 2050. The government has announced plans to introduce a 9pm watershed on TV and a ban on paid-for advertising online for unhealthy food and drink, plus new restrictions on the promotion of unhealthy food and drink in retail outlets and online.  However, a damning 28-page report, commissioned by the government’s own obesity research unit and seen by the Guardian, warns that these efforts will fail unless much wider action is urgently taken to transform the entire food environment. The review, by the Centre for Food Policy at London’s City University, found that easy access to and availability of unhealthy food 24 hours a day across the UK makes losing weight “difficult” for millions of people who are trying. “People engaging in weight management reported eating more, simply because food was always easily available and this close and constant exposure triggered them to want food more often,” the review found. “People also reported that being met everywhere with promotions made it very difficult not to think about food or make unplanned purchases of HFSS [high in fat, salt or sugar] food.” Even Britons who are “trying really hard” to lose weight are being “thwarted in their efforts” because of the amount of unhealthy food they encounter each day. City University’s experts undertook the review for the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) obesity policy research unit, which commissions independent research to inform ministers. The review concludes that even well-designed weight management services will only have a “limited impact” on Britain’s long-term efforts to promote and maintain weight loss if ministers fail to improve the food environment at the same time. Kimberley Neve, the lead author of the review, said: “This review highlights not only how difficult it is to lose weight in Britain, and keep it off, but also that it’s not just about willpower or self-control: even people trying really hard are thwarted in their efforts by unhealthy food options that are everywhere – they’re easy to find, cheap to buy, quick and appealing.” The review found that the relatively lower cost of unhealthy food options made weight management “particularly difficult” for people on a low income, with unhealthy food more likely to be promoted and on offer in shops and supermarkets. “With Christmas treats in abundance in the supermarkets, and new year resolutions around the corner, the narrative needs to shift so that instead of going on the usual January diet, people ask for a food environment that supports them to be healthy,” said Neve, a research assistant for the food systems and policy analysis workstream of the NIHR Obesity Policy Research Unit at City University’s Centre for Food Policy. “For that, you need policy to level the playing field for industry to start making changes.” Experts not involved with the review said its findings were incredibly stark. Jane DeVille-Almond, the chair of the British Obesity Society, said: “Pretty much every activity we encounter, outside our homes today, involves our senses being bombarded with food aromas. The sad fact is many of these foods are considered bad food choices, especially if we are trying to lose weight or eat more healthily.” Britain must “steer changes” in the food environment if it is to become healthier, she said. “Cinemas, leisure and activity centres, hospitals, work spaces, supermarkets and food outlets all need to work on offering and promoting tasty healthier choices.” Caroline Cerny, the alliance lead at the Obesity Health Alliance (OHA), said the review showed Britain’s obesity crisis was “far less a problem of individual behaviour and lack of willpower” and “far more about the environments around us”. She added: “The UK’s health problems reflect an environment that is flooded with unhealthy food and drinks.” A separate report by the OHA published earlier this year said Britons are exposed to an “obesogenic environment” from birth, “one in which calorie-dense, nutrient-poor food is accessible, abundant, affordable and normalised and where physical activity opportunities are not built into everyday life.” The new review found that people often come up with diet plans, but shops, supermarkets, advertising on public transport and workplaces can make it almost impossible for them to stick to their routine. “The ubiquity and appeal of unhealthy foods means that people actively trying to lose weight or keep it off must avoid parts of the food environment – a certain aisle in the supermarket, the work canteen or a friend’s party – to be able to adhere to healthy eating plans,” it said. “Government attempts to address this with new restrictions on junk food marketing in 2022 are a positive first step,” said Cerny. “But we need much more, including levies on the food industry to incentivise them to produce healthier products.” Ministers are being urged to accept seven policy recommendations. These include shifting the balance in the UK food environment so there are more discounts on healthier foods such as fruit and vegetables. Businesses should also be helped “to provide healthier options in the workplace” for employees, and fast food outlets should be incentivised to sell healthy options, the review urges. Tam Fry, the chair of the National Obesity Forum, said similar measures were urged a decade ago, but ministers failed to act. “The government’s responsibility deal launched in 2011 was an attempt to tackle all the issues around HFSS food and was accepted by food companies as long as it was free from regulation. The government declined to legislate and the deal unravelled. The researchers’ demands must now be mandated – no ifs and no buts.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “As part of our obesity strategy to get the nation fit and healthy, we are introducing mandatory calorie labelling in large restaurants, cafes and takeaways, restricting advertising of foods high in fat, salt and sugar being shown on TV before 9pm and in paid-for advertising online, as well as restricting less healthy food promotions in stores and online. “Additionally we have invested £70m into adult weight management services made available through the NHS and councils, so that people living with obesity have access to support that can help them to lose weight. “The Office for Health Improvement and Disparities will build on our national efforts to tackle obesity, improve mental health and promote physical activity.”",News/Society,UK obesity plan will fail without action on unhealthy food – report,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/27/uk-obesity-strategy-unhealthy-food-environment-report
12/27/2021,"A dog had to undergo life-saving surgery after scoffing six packets of potentially deadly Christmas chocolate coins. Hugo, a six-year-old Staffordshire bull terrier, helped himself to the chocolate treats – poisonous to dogs – when owner Amie popped out to the shops.  She returned to her home in Plymouth, Devon, to find the chocolate coins gone and wrappers strewn across the floor, before rushing Hugo to a nearby PDSA pet hospital. “I’d only been to the shops briefly and came back to find torn-up packets and bits of foil all over the floor, with the chocolate gone,” she said. “At first Hugo seemed fine, but I felt sick with worry when he began vomiting blood. He then had a seizure, which was terrifying, so I called PDSA immediately.” Hugo was assessed, sedated and had an X-ray, which revealed his stomach was full of foil, needing surgery to remove it. PDSA vet nurse Donna Southwould said: “Hugo was kept in overnight after his major surgery. He needed an intravenous fluid drip, medication and intensive nursing care to aid his recovery. “He was very lucky, and could have died if he had not been treated in time. While he’s not completely out of the woods yet, thankfully Hugo is now at home on strict rest, and on the road to recovery.” Advising owners to be aware of the dangers of festive treats for their pets, she added: “Many of us have treats, sweets and chocolates aplenty in the house, and while the festive period can be a time for indulgence, it’s important to remember that some of these foods are very harmful to our pets. “Foods including chocolate, mince pies, onions, raisins, grapes, some nuts, sage-and-onion stuffing and Christmas cake can all be harmful and should be kept safely out of paws’ reach.” Amie added: “I don’t know what I would have done without the incredibly kind and caring staff at PDSA – they were amazing. I honestly don’t think Hugo would be here without them. “They went above and beyond for him and I will be forever grateful. There were a number of times I thought we were going to lose him, so to have him home for Christmas is a miracle.” A PDSA spokeswoman said: “If you think your pet might have eaten something they shouldn’t, call your vet immediately as they might need urgent treatment.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Dog saved by surgery after eating six packets of chocolate coins,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/27/dog-saved-by-surgery-after-eating-six-packets-of-chocolate-coins
12/27/2021,"Never confuse fantasy and “realty”. It’s a sentence that has floated, jokingly, around my family ever since my father’s colleague uttered the bungle to him years ago. We New Yorkers, of course, never confuse fantasy and realty. But in our house we happily confuse the two all the time.  For months last year, when we were making our way through Laura Ingalls Wilder’s Little House on the Prairie series, my kindergartner would stride around the apartment in a full pioneer girl’s getup, complete with bonnet, asking me how best to break the oxen or till the land. She committed, deeply, to the role, cut from the same cloth as Jeremy Strong and other method actors, insisting her pajamas were made of calico and roasting in the dress throughout the summer, even as she pretended a blizzard was swirling outside and she could see her breath in the air. “You want some ice cream?” This, my preschooler asks from various perches as her imaginary ice cream stand roams the living room, the sadistic vendor offering flavors that are, often, suddenly sold out. On rare occasions, she’ll morph into a doctor, offering shots with her scoops, though she’s highly specialized, treating but one ailment: jumping so high on the trampoline that you hurt your arm. It’s some botched version of what happened to her older sister, who fractured her elbow last year after a fall from some monkey bars, but remains seared in her mind as something very bad that can be fixed with a quick injection. And in the last few weeks, her pretend play has gotten even more intense, with nightly demands for trampoline accident– related bedtime stories. “At two and a half, three years old, the fuzziness between reality and fantasy is blurred,” Kathy Hirsh-Pasek told me when I reached her by phone. “And I think fantasy is very powerful for kids – it’s a safe place.” Hirsh-Pasek is a professor of psychology at Temple University, where she studies child development, and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. I called her in the hopes that she could put my children’s amped-up pretend play into the context of our chaotic year. Was it a plea for help, an indication that our new normal, with its constantly moving lines in the sand – you can see Nana and Papa indoors, but with masks, or maybe only outside, but at a distance; here’s a Zoom kit sent home from school before winter break, which we may have to use, but probably not – was taking its toll? When Hirsh-Pasek’s children were in that liminal reality-fantasy age, she told me, there were real monsters in their closet. “So we did a whole ceremony with dream catchers, we turned the mattress around, we grabbed the monsters and threw them down the toilet,” she remembered. “We were letting the kids know that they have the power to control something, even if they don’t. It’s a really powerful message.” And it may be particularly important now, when children, however sheltered from the specifics of this rolling uncertainty, are internalizing more than we know. “They pick up on every little thing we do, they model it, they understand it, they watch us like they are sociologists,” Hirsh-Pasek said. “And we’ve been a wreck.” I may not be wearing a calico dress and doling out shots for hyper-specific trampoline accidents, but haven’t we all been living, a little bit, in fantasy land over the past year and a half? Every time I make and then cancel dinner plans; every time I convince myself that by this or that date, I won’t have to affix a tiny surgical mask on to my pint-sized urban doctor and send her off to preschool; every night I think I’ll forego that handful, or three, of leftover Halloween candy to take the edge off – it’s all fantasy. But, for a few moments, I live in that safe space. Kids just do it for way longer, finding real comfort in their imagination. The kindergartner and I just finished reading The BFG, which I found to be both a particularly enjoyable way to suspend reality, but also a wonderful allegory for parenting during the pandemic. For the four people out there who have not yet read this Roald Dahl classic (spoilers ahead), it’s about a Big Friendly Giant and an orphan, Sophie, who catches sight of him one dark night from the orphanage window, as he’s blowing something into a child’s room across the way. He sees her looking, scoops her up, and whisks her off to Giant Country, where she learns that while the BFG catches dreams and blows them into children’s rooms at night, there are other evil giants who roam the world, snatching people from their beds and eating them. The plot turns when Sophie and the BFG decide to do something about it. In the end, the bad giants get captured, and, as in so much of Dahl’s fiction, the child triumphs. “It’s offering a way to say yeah, there are some monsters out there, but guess what, we have the power to deal with them,” Hirsh-Pasek told me. “Fantasy can make things that are scary not so scary, help kids cope just a little bit better, and show them that with us, they have the power to change anything.” She paused. “Maybe that’s not 1,000% honest. I get that. But I’m down with fantasy.” (She later sent me a study concluding that young children often learn real-world information better if it’s presented in a fantastical story that violates real world paradigms.) The other night, hoping to prolong my nightly escapes with Dahl, I looked up the name on The BFG’s inscription page: Olivia. A quick Google search heaved the moment on its axis, refocusing everything like a Hitchcockian dolly zoom shot. Olivia was Dahl’s daughter, who died suddenly in 1962, at age seven, of encephalitis brought on by the measles. “As the illness took its usual course, I can remember reading to her often in bed and not feeling particularly alarmed about it,” he wrote in a widely distributed open letter urging parents to vaccinate their children, published during a measles outbreak in 1986. “Then one morning, when she was well on the road to recovery, I was sitting on her bed showing her how to fashion little animals out of coloured pipe-cleaners, and when it came to her turn to make one herself, I noticed that her fingers and her mind were not working together … In an hour, she was unconscious. In twelve hours she was dead.” He dedicated James and the Giant Peach to Olivia when she was still alive. Twenty years after her death, he published The BFG with her name at its front. As Dahl knew so well, in fantasy, you can do anything: make rivers of chocolate, fly inside giant peaches, even bring daughters back to life. The conceit of the book, which you learn in the last few pages, is that the BFG actually wrote the thing, and just published it under another name. The night we finished, my kindergartner looked at the cover for a while. “I don’t think that’s actually true,” she said. My heart sank, imagining her passing over that invisible boundary, from fantasy-believer to hardened realist, a transition I feared might be accelerated by the last few years. Then, as she closed her eyes and started to drift off, she mumbled, “I think what actually happened is that Sophie told the story to Roald Dahl, and he wrote it down.” And of course, in a way, she’s right.

12/27/2021,"A screening programme for prostate cancer could be created in the next three to five years, an expert at the Institute of Cancer Research in London has said. Prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer in men, with one in eight white men diagnosed in their lifetime. It affects black men disproportionately, with one in four diagnosed.  There are about 50,000 new cases of prostate cancer in the UK each year and about 11,000 men will die as a result. Despite this there is no totally effective screening programme because a blood test showing levels of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is only a guide. It does not accurately distinguish between dangerous cancers and harmless ones. Prof Ros Eeles, of the Institute of Cancer Research, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that if a PSA test was carried out now on every man in the UK over the age of 55 it would lead to over-treatment. “We will end up treating at least 12 men for every one man that you should really find disease which is going to impact on that man’s life. In the breast screening programme, it’s three to one,” she said. But Eeles said she was optimistic that would change. “With the advances in genetics and also imaging, particularly MRI, realistically we do need some more data but we’re probably looking at getting close to a tailored screening programme in the next three to five years,” she said. “We might need to use all of them together … so we can find those who have significant disease.” Prostate cancer featured heavily on the programme at the behest of the guest editor Michael Dobbs, the writer and Conservative peer who was diagnosed and treated for prostate cancer this year. It killed his father and one of his brothers. The programme heard that many men do not get tested and do not seek help despite the outcomes of being treated being good. The presenter Bill Turnbull told Dobbs that he had ignored possible symptoms for months before finally going to see his GP. “Maybe if I’d seen my GP earlier, I wouldn’t be in quite the mess I am in now. But men do that. ‘I’ll be all right, there’s nothing wrong with me’, and it’s embarrassing.” Turnbull has prostate cancer that is treatable but not curable. He said, laughing, that his hope in life “was to stay alive as long as possible”. Prof Peter Johnson, the national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, told the programme that, because of the pandemic, there were several thousand fewer men starting treatment than in a normal year. “It isn’t that there’s a big backlog in the system of people waiting to be diagnosed, it’s literally we haven’t even met them yet and that’s what we’re anxious to reverse.” He urged men to use the risk checker on the Prostate Cancer UK website.",News/Society,UK prostate cancer screening programme ‘could be running in three years’,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/27/uk-prostate-cancer-screening-programme-could-be-running-in-three-years
