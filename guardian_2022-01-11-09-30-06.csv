1/11/2022,"Steven Gerrard refused to blame a lengthy VAR call that led to an Aston Villa equaliser being ruled out for offside for his team’s elimination from the FA Cup by Manchester United on Monday night, with the manager instead urging his team to “flip” the result when hosting them in the Premier League on Saturday. Villa lost the third-round tie at Old Trafford 1-0 having conceded Scott McTominay’s early header but then dominated throughout. United also rode their luck as Villa had two goals ruled out in the second half.  The latter was a relatively straightforward offside call against Danny Ings, who had played in Ollie Watkins to poke home from close range. However, the first was more debatable and involved a delay of more than three minutes with VAR calling on the referee, Michael Oliver, to make a judgment after Ings had scored from close range. Oliver consulted the pitchside monitor and eventually ruled that Villa’s midfielder Jacob Ramsey was offside and had impeded Edinson Cavani in the build-up. “The disappointment was that it took three and a half minutes to iron it out,” said Gerrard. “We had the momentum at the time and that three and a half minutes took a lot of the sting out of the game. But it’s not the reason we lost. We need to focus on other things, not just VAR going against us. The players have an opportunity to flip the mood, flip the feeling [on Saturday] – they have an opportunity at Villa Park to straighten that out.” Gerrard also brushed off being taunted throughout the tie by the Old Trafford crowd for being a former captain of Liverpool. “It was relatively quiet – I have been to noisier stadiums than this,” he said. “ It was a good Cup tie, a good atmosphere but in terms of what I got, water off a duck’s back.” Meanwhile United’s interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, defended Marcus Rashford, who performed poorly against Villa and has now gone 11 games without scoring, his worst run since the 2016-17 season. “He’s trying hard, done well in training in the last couple of days,” said the 63-year-old. “In the first half we found him quite often - the second half not as often and so we decided to make changes with Anthony Elanga and Jesse Lingard [coming on for Rashford and Bruno Fernandes].”",Sport/Football,Gerrard refuses to blame VAR after FA Cup exit against Manchester United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/10/gerrard-refuses-to-blame-var-after-fa-cup-exit-against-manchester-united
1/11/2022,"Britain’s retailers have said the soaring cost of living risks dragging down high street sales in 2022 after a bumper Christmas trading period and year of recovery in consumer spending. Sounding the alarm over the risks for the UK economy as whole, the British Retail Consortium said there were significant headwinds for the industry in 2022 from high inflation, rising energy bills and planned tax increases.  In a joint report with the accountancy firm KPMG, the BRS said soaring living costs would erode households’ spending power and had the potential to weigh on retail sales after a strong festive season and a year of recovering ground that was lost during the first stage of the Covid-19 pandemic. According to the latest snapshot, total retail sales rose by 2.1% during the key month of December, compared with a year earlier, and were up by 4.6% compared with 2019, before the pandemic struck. Reflecting a stronger performance for the full year, as Britain’s economy recovered from repeated lockdowns, total sales grew by 9.9% compared with 2020, and by 6.6% compared with 2019. However, retail bosses said the emergence of Omicron and increasing pressure on household budgets could hit sales at the start of 2022. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said: “Retail faces significant headwinds in 2022, as consumer spending is held back by rising inflation, increasing energy bills, and April’s national insurance hike. “It will take continued agility and resilience if they are to battle the storm ahead, while also tackling issues from labour shortages to rising transport and logistics costs.” Boris Johnson is under growing pressure from his own MPs to take action over the crisis. Household utility bills are expected to rise sharply from April, when the energy regulator, Ofgem, lifts its consumer price cap after surging wholesale gas and electricity costs. Energy industry bosses have said prices could rise by more than 50%, or about £700 per year, in a “national crisis”. The increase will come in the same month as the government’s plan to raise national insurance by 1.25 percentage points is introduced. According to the report by BRC and KPMG, sales of clothing and jewellery continued to dominate Christmas gift buying, while spending on food and drink was solid despite concern over the impact of Omicron. Industry leaders said concerns about supply chain problems appeared to have been overcome as retailers “pulled out all the stops”. Dickinson said many people had chosen to shop online in December rather than travel to nearby high streets and shopping centres. Sales of loungewear were up as office staff returned to working from home and spending on formalwear dipped as Christmas parties were cancelled. Separate figures from Barclaycard showed consumer card spending grew 12.2% in December compared with the same period in 2019, boosted by supermarket purchases as consumers stocked up on festive food and drink. However, spending on hospitality and leisure slumped as festive gatherings were cancelled and more people isolated or chose to stay at home. Barclaycard, the UK’s biggest credit card provider, processing nearly half of all card transactions, said spending at restaurants decreased by 14.1% in December compared with the same month in 2019, and followed a 3.5% fall in November. Spending in bars, pubs and clubs in December rose 21.2%, down on the 35% increase in November, compared with the same months in 2019. Barclaycard said 43% of 2,000 people surveyed on behalf of the credit card provider expected high inflation to affect their household budgeting. “The wider economic picture is encouraging consumers to be more cautious with their discretionary spending,” it said.",News/Business,UK retailers warn sales at risk from soaring cost of living in 2022,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/11/uk-retailers-warn-sales-at-risk-from-soaring-cost-of-living-in-2022
1/11/2022,"Liberal MPs are split on whether the Australian government should again cancel Novak Djokovic’s visa after the world No 1’s win in court on Monday. Despite the government agreeing to release Djokovic from detention and quash the original decision to cancel his visa, the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, is yet to decide whether to use a separate power to deport the tennis star.  A decision is expected as early as Tuesday but the government faces internal division over whether to enforce Australia’s hardline border policies against Djokovic. Liberal MPs from Hawke’s home state of New South Wales – including John Alexander and Dave Sharma – have argued that Djokovic should now be allowed to stay. But Julian Simmonds, the chair of parliament’s law enforcement committee, said the court loss on procedural grounds should not change the substantive decision to deport him. The division underscores the difficulty of the momentous political decision before Hawke: let Djokovic stay and play for a record 21st grand slam singles title; or deport him, which could trigger a three-year ban from re-entering Australia. Alexander, a retiring MP and former professional tennis player, told ABC Radio on Tuesday it would be a mistake to recancel the visa after the “very strong decision” from the judge, Anthony Kelly of the federal circuit court. “There seems no reason to do so, the judge has been clear in his finding ... saying what more could this man have done to meet the criteria,” Alexander said. “I see it as something that should not become a political problem.” Alexander argued that Djokovic had “filled out all of the forms to meet the conditions of exemption in that he had tested positive to Covid-19 in December, one of the criteria, he met it and therefore the judges ruled in his favour”. In court, the government argued that having Covid by itself did not justify an exemption, because Djokovic had recovered. Alexander played down suggestions that cancelling Djokovic’s visa could lead to Australia losing the grand slam tournament but said it would “diminish” the case to retain it. “If the Australian Open is making conditions that people seem to meet but then are not allowed to come ... that would not help our status.” Sharma told Guardian Australia that “whatever mistakes had been made” it was clear Djokovic was “not trying to subvert our immigration system”. “For whatever reason, he was allowed to board a flight with the [vaccination exemption] paperwork as he had it,” Sharma said. “He’s made a good faith attempt to comply with [the rules], he’s here now – it would be a shame if he wasn’t able to play. “Given the saga that’s already gone here it would be better to let him play. He’s the defending Australian Open champion, the tournament would be less without his presence.” Simmonds told the BBC Djokovic had won on a “process issue” about being denied the time he had been promised to respond to an intention to cancel his visa. But there was “no indication” in court the tennis star had further information that the government was unaware of when it made the decision, he said. “If the information is still the same, regardless of process issues, I suspect the answer should still be the same.” Simmonds said the government was “trying to ensure one rule for all – whether you’re a celebrity or anyone else”. Given even unvaccinated Australian citizens must go through quarantine, Simmonds said – “The idea an unvaccinated celebrity could come without quarantine rubs people the wrong way.” He added: “Certainly I would favour the visa being cancelled as a member of parliament, to ensure one rule for everyone, and there isn’t hypocrisy [about the way rules are applied], whether you’re a famous celebrity or sports person.” Simmonds suggested the rule that ministerial revocation results in a three-year exclusion might not apply but was “something to consider”. The government did not intend to punish Djokovic, he said. Labor’s home affairs spokesperson, Kristina Keneally, described the situation as an “incredible mess”. Keneally told Sunrise on Tuesday morning the government “[has] a lot of explaining to do because what we have seen from this is Australians now know they cannot trust the Morrison government to enforce the rules at the border and they have done incredible damage”. Keneally raised the stakes for the government, arguing that failing to cancel Djokovic’s visa “does incredible damage to our tough border laws”. “The Morrison government looks like a pack of idiots that could not organise a meat raffle in a local RSL,” she said. “These are extraordinary circumstances. The Morrison government issued Novak Djokovic a visa on 18 November. “The Australian Open is not a secret event. The fact Novak Djokovic … wanted to come to Australia and play was not a state secret and yet Mr [Scott] Morrison, as he has done at every stage in this pandemic, failed to plan, failed to act",News/Australia news,Novak Djokovic: Liberal MPs divided over whether Australian government should again cancel visa,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/11/novak-djokovic-liberal-mps-divided-over-whether-australian-government-should-again-cancel-visa
1/11/2022,"Officials in San Francisco are asking residents not to call 911 except in dire emergencies to avoid further straining emergency resources, as coronavirus cases deplete the ranks of health workers, ambulance crews, firefighters and other essential workers. The Omicron variant, which appears more likely to cause breakthrough cases even among vaccinated people, has begun to thin the ranks of those most needed to fight this latest wave of infections. San Francisco mayor London Breed said on Friday that ​​about 400 city employees, including emergency responders, had either tested positive for Covid-19 or were isolated at home due to exposure.  “Only call 911 or go to the emergency [department] for life-threatening medical emergencies,” the San Francisco Department of Emergency Management tweeted this weekend. “Keep medics available for life-threatening situations.” While the new variant appears to cause less severe illness, especially among the vaccinated, its highly contagious nature has meant that more and more essential workers are contracting the disease, leaving California’s health and emergency systems critically strained. California has recorded nearly 6m coronavirus cases since the beginning of the pandemic according to state tallies, including more than 300,000 new cases this weekend. The daily coronavirus case rate has been higher during this Omicron-fueled surge than ever before – with about 145 out of every 100,000 residents testing positive. Meanwhile, Los Angeles county – which has cumulatively recorded the most coronavirus cases in the US throughout the pandemic, last week marked its highest single-day total for new cases. On Friday, the state’s governor, Gavin Newsom, deployed members of the National Guard to help administer tests at overwhelmed and understaffed testing sites and said the state will send out more National Guard members this week, amid reports that residents are waiting in long lines for hours to receive Covid tests. The deployment would allow strained centers to conduct more tests daily, and help backfill staff absences. Meanwhile, the state public health department is weighing whether to pause elective surgeries across the state, as individual hospitals are already considering which procedures to delay as Covid-19 reverberates through ranks of doctors, nurses and other hospital staff. This weekend, the health department issued controversial guidelines instructing workers at hospitals and skilled nursing facilities who tested positive for Covid-19 but were experiencing no symptoms to immediately return to work. The guidelines, which will remain in effect until 1 February, are necessary “due to the critical staffing shortages currently being experienced across the health care continuum because of the rise in the Omicron variant”, the health department explained in a statement. The new policy comes amid record resignations and burnout among health workers two years into the pandemic. “No patient wants to be cared for by someone who has Covid-19 or was just exposed to it,” said Gabe Montoya, an emergency room technician at Kaiser Medical Center in Downey, representing the SEIU-United Healthcare Workers. “Hospital workers cannot take much more,” said Gisela Thomas, a respiratory therapist in Palm Springs, in a statement issued by the union. On Saturday, Newsom announced a new emergency funding package, that includes $614m to help hospitals hire more staff, $200m to boost emergency response and state public health capacity and $1.2b to bolster testing. Although the state is now registering high numbers of positive cases, there are indications that a smaller proportion of these cases are severe – especially among those who are vaccinated. A smaller proportion of coronavirus patients now need hospitalization, and fewer are being admitted to the ICU than was the case last year, health officials have noted. Still, unvaccinated coronavirus patients have continued to fill hospitals that are once again losing the capacity to accommodate them. “Every resident can also do their part to protect our health care personnel and hospitals” by getting vaccinated, said Los Angeles public health director Barbara Ferrer. “Vaccinated individuals are between 10 and 30 times less likely to need hospital care than those unvaccinated.”",News/US news,San Francisco officials tell residents not to call 911 amid Omicron surge,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/10/san-francisco-coronavirus-omicron-emergency-california

It’s tempting to ignore doubts and see what we want to see.” This is a British story though. Is this happening here?
