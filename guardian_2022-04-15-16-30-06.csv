4/15/2022,"India’s Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa, 16, widely forecast as a future world class grandmaster, added to his growing reputation on Tuesday when he won the €5,000 first prize at the Reykjavik Open with an unbeaten 7.5/9. Earlier in his career, the Chennai teenager was the youngest ever international master, among the youngest ever GMs and the second youngest to reach a 2600 Fide rating. He was singled out in this column more than five years ago for an 18-move brilliancy at age 11 in the Isle of Man which went global and was compared to Bobby Fischer’s Game of the Century against Donald Byrne. Most recently, Praggnandhaa’s online win against Magnus Carlsen in the Airthings Masters made him the youngest to beat the No 1 in a serious game. The quality of his play at Reykjavik also impressed, notably with a brilliancy in the penultimate round. Yet, despite it all, Praggnanandhaa’s Reykjavik victory came courtesy of a final-round gift from another Indian prodigy. Dommaraju Gukesh, 15, was two pawns up near the move 40 time control, but two catastrophic blunders gave away first the win, then the draw, before allowing a decisive checkmate in one threat. Two other teenagers made their mark in Iceland, The youngest ever GM, Abhimanyu Mishra, 13, suffered criticism when he won the title via closed all-play-alls in Budapest which some thought were too easy. Mishra has answered his detractors by continuing to advance. His tied second in Iceland pushed his Fide rating up to 2535, giving him still a full year to break the record for the youngest ever 2600 player, currently held by John Burke of the US at 14 years and two months. Hans Niemann is 18, old by prodigy standards, yet the Californian streamer, Harvard reject, and 2021 US junior champion, has forced his way into the limelight by a sustained run where he gained 150 rating points in 18 months to reach the world top 100, coupled with inventive attacking play. Niemann scored a draw with Black against Carlsen in the online Charity Cup, plans to play nine tournaments in a row this summer, and has boundless ambition. See his final-round miniature in the style of Mikhail Tal. England had 26 players at Reykjavik, the largest number in an overseas open for several years, as players from GMs and IMs to veterans and teens took their opportunity. Brandon Clarke had the best English result, finishing 12th with 6.5/9 and a single defeat. The much travelled Midlander, 26, has had spells in California and Australia, where he won the New Zealand Open, and is now back home and well established in the England top 20. England’s outstanding success came in the senior over-65 category, where the Surrey IMs Peter Large, 66, and Nigel Povah, 69, tied for first on 5.5/9 with the six-time European team gold and USSR championship silver medallist Oleg Romanishin, 70. Romanishin, who now represents Ukraine, was placed first on tie-break with Large second and Povah third. Large’s total included draws with both Romanishin and with India’s No 4 seed and 2633-rated Baskan Adhiban. The final rounds also brought some painful English setbacks, notably for the “Ginger GM” Simon Williams, Guildford’s Harry Grieve who missed out on his second GM norm, and the 12-year-old talent Sohum Lohia, whose calculation skills were exposed in the final two rounds but who even so achieved a sizeable rating points gain. What of Carlsen? The multi-talented world champion, who in 2019 impressed when he led over seven million rivals at Fantasy Football, has been showing off another skill – at poker. The Norwegian Poker Championship was played in Dublin due to Norway’s strict gambling laws, and Carlsen finished 25th out of 1050 players, earning a cash prize of around €5,000. Carlsen was finally knocked out by the poker specialist Tom Aksel Bedell, who said afterwards that he did not really want to win, as he considers Carlsen one of the three greatest Norwegian sportsmen, alongside the footballer Erling Haaland and the golfer Viktor Hovland. Carlsen will be back at the chessboard on 22 April, when the Oslo Esports Cup, part of the Meltwater Champions Tour, starts in Oslo. Uniquely for the Tour, all eight players will be physically present in the studio, rather than playing remotely from their homes. A major attraction for chess fans is that Praggnandhaa, the teen age star of the moment, will be one of Carlsen’s seven rivals. 3811: 1 Qf7+! Nxf7 2 exf7+ Kf8 3 Ng6+ Qxg6 4 hxg6 Rb8 5 Kg2 and White’s two extra pawns will win, though it takes some time. The main point, which Hjartarson missed, is 1 Qf7+ Nxf7 2 exf7+ Kh7 and now 3 fxe8=Q?? Qg2+! 4 Kxg2 is a stalemate draw but 3 fxe8=B! wins. A forced promotion to bishop is exceptionally rare.",Sport/Sport,Chess: Teenagers top in Reykjavik while English hopes fade at the finish,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/15/chess-teenagers-top-reykjavik-while-english-hopes-fade-at-the-finish
4/15/2022,"Julian wants to plan all meals a week ahead to control calories. But I’m now bored to tears My fiance, Julian, is obsessed with batch cooking. We live together at his flat, and when I first moved in I found his habit handy as it saved time and seemed to help with portion control: you plan all your meals for the week ahead, cook a large portion and freeze some to eat later. Three years later, though, I’m bored to tears. We end up eating the same thing over and over. Julian likes to make a couple of big dishes on Sunday evening, like turkey casserole or fish pie. He will then portion them up to either eat every day for the next week, or freeze them for the future. He works as a gym instructor and is very health-conscious. He loves to bring in the same combo of chicken, rice and broccoli every day for lunch, which he prepares in advance. He has them all pre-cooked in Tupperware boxes. We batch cook our dinners every Sunday, making a week’s worth of dishes to freeze. At first, I wanted to lose weight and Julian’s methods helped me stay on track, as we stuck to a calorie limit for each portion. But now I’m keen for some excitement. I’m more relaxed with my fitness goals and I don’t like the idea of discussing what to eat on Sunday and having to stick to it all week. Julian says that these methods help him stick to his goals. But sometimes the dishes don’t keep well. Monday’s chicken and broccoli doesn’t taste half as good on a Friday. Recently we were tucking into a meal we’d batch cooked a month ago. It was a defrosted shepherd’s pie that had become all mushy and watery. I said to Julian that I wanted to eat something else. We had an argument because he told me I was “wasteful”. I snapped and said I wouldn’t compromise on taste, and threw the pie away. Julian needs to understand that cooking in bulk isn’t for everyone. He says I’m going to undo all my hard work if I start eating what I want, because I’ll fall victim to high-calorie meals. I’ve told him to get lost on that front; I’m not a child. I don’t want the same thing every night. I like eating the same thing every day – and Annie has lost weight. If she cooks, she might put it back on I work in a gym and like to look and feel my best. My cooking methods protect me from opting for high-calorie meals, as every meal is already portioned up. I know the nutrient content of everything I eat. I’m a bit like a robot, just eating what I’m supposed to, but it keeps me focused. At first, Annie loved our batch-cooked dinners. She wanted to lose some weight and she reached her goals with my help. Now she wants to switch things up. But why fix what’s not broken? And what if she puts all the weight back on? She is not the most disciplined of people. Annie moans that I take up the whole weekend cooking, but planning ahead means you actually reduce the time spent in the kitchen overall. We’ve probably spent more quality time together because of my kitchen habits. We also save money on our food shop because batch cooking reduces food waste. You only buy what you need – I don’t roam the supermarkets just picking stuff up aimlessly any more, and I don’t have rogue ingredients lying in the back of the fridge going off. There is no reason to get a takeaway either because dinner is always good to go. Recently, when we had a dinner that hadn’t defrosted well, Annie moaned and said she couldn’t eat it. I offered to put it back in the oven, but she wasn’t having it and threw it away. I thought that was very wasteful. I was also a bit offended that she just dumped a meal that I had made for her. I make all my meals with love; they aren’t bland. That evening I ate my dinner alone. Annie should stick with our lifestyle as it has been good for us so far. She is not as good a cook as me. If she starts cooking her own dinners separately, she will be faffing around each night deciding what to eat while I’ll have my dinner ready in seconds. If that’s the case I won’t wait to eat with her. I like eating the same thing every day. I don’t find it tedious. It actually reassures me to know I’m staying focused with my nutrition goals. Is Annie right to complain about Julian’s batch cooking? Julian is guilty. As someone who also trains regularly at the gym and has to eat a certain amount of calories a day, I can understand how batch cooking is useful. However, it soon gets boring. I think Julian’s method is perfect for a single person, but when you’re in a couple, compromises have to be made.Kiran, 23 Julian’s diet and nutrition regime is logical and successful, suiting his goals excellently, and were he living alone it would seem admirable. However, in a situation where meals are shared, I do not think this is sustainable.Francis, 72 Julian has a system that works for him. If Annie isn’t enjoying it any more, she should make her own meals. However, Julian should be more flexible and wait for Annie so they can eat together.Bekah, 32 Julian should lay off Annie; she’s his fiancee, not his client. And if she puts weight back on, the world will keep turning. It doesn’t sound like Annie wants to stop batch cooking altogether, just to add some variety. Why not batch cook three weeknights and let Annie plan the menu for the other two?Emma, 37 Julian is guilty of not supporting Annie’s desire to try new things. Relationships are about compromise and support, not holding your partner’s weight against them. Julian may also find planning meals in advance and cooking them on the day can be both economical and healthy.Lewis, 29 So now you can be the judge, click on the poll below to tell us: should Julian stop batch cooking? We’ll share the results on next week’s You be the judge.

4/15/2022,"They read like messages from one of the creepier dating apps, or else the sort of unwanted lechery with which many young women on social media are grimly familiar. One man suggests sharing “a large bed, we could sleep together” and then letting “what we both want happen”. Another is keen to let the recipient know she is “so beautiful”, while a third immediately asks, “Are you single?” But these aren’t just any old clumsy sexual overtures. These are messages left for women fleeing war-torn Ukraine, on a Facebook group seeking to match refugees with Britons offering sanctuary. The grotesque parody of shelter some men see fit to offer is a chance to flee the threat of rape by Russian soldiers, but only for somewhere you might want to barricade yourself into the spare bedroom at night. An undercover reporter posing as a refugee found more than half the messages sent to her came from men living alone, some explicit about the strings attached to their offers. What kind of man, you may wonder, sees in a tragedy a sexual opportunity? Well, in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, it was British aid workers who paid desperate locals for sex. In Somalia, ravaged by war, it was Belgian and Italian peacekeepers sent by the UN. In the makeshift refugee camps of northern France, it was people smugglers preying on potential clients. And now on the borders between Ukraine and its neighbours, it’s sex traffickers, masquerading as good Samaritans offering unwary women a lift. Wherever there is conflict, there is chaos and disruption and unguarded moments for women and children, and with depressing predictability some will always seek to exploit that. But it is the predictability that makes it more preventable. The UN has now asked the British government to ban single men from housing female refugees, advice that Michael Gove (the cabinet minister in charge of the refugee matching scheme) should act on and make policy. The more complex emerging challenge, however, is what to do about the horrific scale of systematic sexual violence emerging inside Ukraine itself, as the Russian retreat from occupied towns and villages frees victims to emerge and tell their stories. As the war correspondent Christina Lamb writes bleakly in her book Our Bodies, Their Battlefield, rape is “the cheapest weapon known to man”, one deployed every bit as strategically and deliberately as bombs and bullets. The aim is to intimidate, degrade and terrify civilians, and in some cultures to ensure victims are rejected by their own families. But some of the stories emerging from Ukraine now have a particularly chilling dimension, one all too familiar in wars of ethnic cleansing, which is the attempt to force women to bear the invading army’s children. In the rape camps set up by Serbian soldiers during the Balkan wars, victims were told they would be forced to bear Serbian babies. In Iraq, Islamic State systematically trafficked and sexually enslaved women from the Yazidi minority as part of a campaign to destroy the community from within, knowing the children born of rape would be deemed Muslims and not Yazidi. Now Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman, Lyudmyla Denisova, reports that in Bucha, 25 girls and women aged 14 to 24 were held in a basement by Russian soldiers who threatened to “rape them to the point where they wouldn’t want sexual contact with any man, to prevent them from having Ukrainian children.” Nine of them are now pregnant. The brutal message is that even if Ukrainians won’t submit to being Russian, their unborn children will have no choice. Meanwhile, Kyiv claims Ukrainian children from occupied cities have been forcibly moved across the border, fast-tracked for adoption by Russian families. When the US president, Joe Biden, talked this week of genocide in Ukraine, lawyers responded that there wasn’t yet enough evidence to meet the legal threshold for such a charge. But at the very least, the propaganda coming out of Moscow suggests this war isn’t simply over territory or strategic interests; that it is increasingly about eradicating the very idea of being Ukrainian, submerging national identity into some twisted fantasy of a Greater Russia. These are war crimes, every bit as much as chemical weapons attacks, and must be prosecuted as vigorously. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, this week launched the Murad Code – named after Nadia Murad, a Nobel peace prize-winning Yazidi woman who survived capture by IS – which is a welcome move to improve the collection of evidence from survivors worldwide. But Ukraine is already diligently gathering evidence. What it needs is help bringing the perpetrators to justice. The Tory peer Arminka Helic has called for a new permanent international body to investigate, prosecute and stamp out rape as a war crime. Helic knows what she’s talking about: a refugee from the Bosnian war, she went on to become special adviser to the then foreign secretary, William Hague. In 2012 she persuaded him to set up an initiative on sexual exploitation in war zones that is still bearing fruit today. But as she puts it, “impunity is the norm” still for a war crime that is less visible than bombed-out cities or mass graves, and often taken less seriously. Training and culture within armed forces worldwide can start to change that, but it’s only when commanding officers actually end up in the dock for overseeing sexual war crimes that the message will really hit home. We can, and must, do better than this. Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion,Rape is being used as a weapon in Ukraine.

4/15/2022,"When Brian Ameche, the husband of Amy Bloom, knowing her taste for simplicity, bought her “a very expensive … sweatshirt with tulle trim”, she might have guessed something was amiss. Looking back, she was “surprised that I didn’t look at that sweatshirt and think, ‘I see that you have Alzheimer’s’”. By this time Brian had begun to forget things, to lose his way and, most distressingly, to become distant with his wife, with whom he had lived in rare concord since their late-life marriage in their 50s. And yet, as I observed in my father when my mother was in the grip of this disease, denial is its almost inevitable attendant. Those closest to the sufferers often find they cannot bear to acknowledge what is happening. Bloom’s sharply observed, often witty, eminently moving memoir charts the gradual progression of the illness from her slow recognition that her husband was not himself, to an eventual diagnosis, followed by a fraught search for a means for them to end his life. For “once Brian had finally been diagnosed it took him less than a week to decide that the ‘long goodbye’ of Alzheimer’s was not for him”. Because of their “eye-of-the-needle” requirements, apparently libertarian laws in the US mean that assisted suicide is all but impossible there. The “right to die in America is about as meaningful as the right to eat or the right to decent housing; you’ve got the right, but it doesn’t mean you’re going to get the goods,” Bloom comments with typical tartness. An old friend offers: “‘If you think you don’t need to go right now, and you want to wait awhile, I can just shoot you myself, in a year or two, in a field.’ Brian hugs him.” His brother, making a similar suggestion, jokes: “I’d be fine in jail. I don’t go out much anyway,” at which Bloom comments: “I have never liked the man more.” Finally they discover Dignitas, the Swiss organisation that assists those whose medical conditions lead them to choose to end their lives rather than endure the miseries of a “natural” death. Here begins the process of fulfilling the exacting demands required to take this mortal step, of which the patient’s own “discernment” is considered paramount. The book is written in short chapters, giving a sense of pace to echo the urgency that now ensues – the couple must achieve their goal before Brian’s mind is too disrupted for the decision to be judged truly his, a requirement that is the sine qua non of the Dignitas process. The account begins on 26 January 2020, in the final stages of this ordeal, with what is to be Brian’s last journey. But it is interspersed with snatches of their history, during which we learn to love the handsome, greedy-for-life Brian, who declares to Bloom: “You should be with a guy who doesn’t mind that you’re smarter than he is, who doesn’t mind that most of the time you’ll be the main event … I don’t know if I can be that guy … but I’d like a shot.” To which Bloom appends, “We married.” It is the swift but telling glimpses of that life together – she an ironic, intellectual, bisexual Jew, he a sporty hedonist from a devout Catholic family – that give the book its peculiar poignancy. But if Brian is the subject, it is Bloom who is the hero of this story. The disease renders her husband incapable of making the necessary tough decisions, of first wheedling and then railroading doctors who persist in the false diagnosis of depression that would prevent Dignitas accepting him as a candidate. It is she who must decide what to tell her children, and whether or not to prepare the grandchildren for the loss of their adored “Babu”. The end of the story is told as frankly and unmawkishly as the rest. An anti-emetic is supplied to ensure the patient doesn’t vomit up the prescribed lethal dose. But Ameche takes his time before downing it. “I know I’m going,” he says. “I’m ready. I’m just not going to hurry.” This is the most painful moment in an account that is not exactly free of painful moments, not just because of what is about to happen, but because some of the last minutes he will spend with Bloom are taken up with old football anecdotes. “I cannot manage to look interested in these stories,” she writes, “because I’m not. He says nothing about our life, our love, our children and grandchildren.” The effectiveness of the anti-emetic wears off, and he must be asked yet again if he wishes to go through with the procedure. He swallows a second dose, this time alongside the drug that kills him, falling silent so that Bloom suddenly longs for the football stories. She sits there until he is “gone from the world”, and she must take the forlorn trip home without him. But he isn’t gone. Because, as Brian enjoined her, she has written about him with all the brave-spirited, undaunted love to which the book bears stupendous witness.  In Love is published by Granta (£16.99).
