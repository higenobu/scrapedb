2/16/2022,"The European court of justice has dismissed complaints from Hungary and Poland against a law that ties EU funds to democratic standards. In a milestone in the battle for the rule of law in the EU, the bloc’s highest court rejected the cases brought by Hungary and Poland “in their entirety”, confirming that countries can be deprived of EU funds when they fail to meet democratic standards.  The EU’s values, such as the rule of law, “define the very identity of the European Union as a legal order”, the court said in a statement about its keenly anticipated ruling. “The court specifies … that compliance with those values cannot be reduced to an obligation which a candidate state must meet in order to accede to the European Union and which it may disregard after accession.” The ruling means the European Commission can dock Hungary and Poland of EU funds in response to widely perceived democratic backsliding in both countries. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, accused of dragging her feet on the issue, came under immediate pressure from across the political spectrum to use the law. ​“No more excuses for Von der Leyen. It’s time to finally act against the rule-of-law violators in our union,” the German Green MEP Daniel Freund tweeted. Petri Sarvamaa, a Finnish MEP and spokesperson on budgetary control for the centre-right European People’s party, said: “It is high time to start implementing the regulation. The clock cannot be restarted to play for time. The commission must act really fast.” In a statement welcoming the ruling, Von der Leyen said the commission would “analyse carefully the reasoning of the judgments and their possible impact on the further steps we will take under the regulation”. She promised the commission would “adopt in the following weeks guidelines providing further clarity about how we apply the mechanism in practice,” adding: “I promised that no case will be lost. And I have kept that promise.” Hungary, named as only a “partly free” country by the NGO Freedom House, has provoked concerns about the spending of EU funds by friends and family of the prime minister, Viktor Orbán. Poland’s nationalist Law and Justice party, led by Jarosław Kaczyński, has been in a long-running battle with Brussels over the independence of its courts, which raises doubts about its stewardship of public money. Reacting to the ruling, Hungary’s justice minister, Judit Varga, said the court had made “a political decision because of our upcoming referendum on child protection”, a follow-up to the Hungarian government’s anti-gay law passed in 2021, which has been condemned as the “instrumentalisation” of LGBTQ+ rights. “The ECJ’s latest ruling is an example of how Brussels is abusing its powers,” Varga said. A spokesperson for Hungary’s ruling Fidesz party claimed the decision was part of efforts “to help the leftist opposition win elections in Hungary”. Orbán is facing an unprecedented challenge from a centre-right former Fidesz-supporting mayor, who is backed by six main opposition parties in upcoming elections. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said he would comment after reading the ruling. The law is intended to protect from fraud against the EU budget, rather than all rule-of-law violations. The plan received strong backing from governments in western Europe, who are net payers into the EU budget. Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Spain, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden went to court to argue in favour of the law. Hungary and Poland, both net recipients of EU funds, have received billions since joining the EU in 2004 to improve their public infrastructure, fund universities and support farmers. Hungary and Poland brought the cases after the EU agreed its “rule-of-law conditionality mechanism” in 2020, a regulation that links EU funds to respect for the rule of law. In an unusual move, EU leaders agreed in December 2020 to wait for the outcome of the legal challenge before the law could be used. That decision was also criticised by MEPs. The Dutch MEP Sophie in ‘t Veld called the decision to delay “another charade”, adding: “We write hundreds of laws every year. Since when does the application of EU law depend on a court ruling?”",News/Law, ECJ dismisses Hungary and Poland’s complaints over rule-of-law measure,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/feb/16/ecj-dismisses-hungary-poland-complaints-eu-rule-of-law-measure
2/16/2022,"A patient in the UK who has died from Lassa fever, an acute viral infection endemic in parts of Africa, was a newborn baby, according to reports. The Guardian reported last week that a patient had died in Bedfordshire after being found to have Lassa fever. The confirmed case brought the total number of people diagnosed with the disease in England to three.  It has now emerged that the patient who died at the Luton and Dunstable hospital was a child, the BBC has reported. All three confirmed cases come from within the same family, the UK Health and Security Agency has said. But where did the virus originate from, what are the symptoms and how transmissible is it? Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness, belonging to the virus family Arenaviridae, that lasts between two and 21 days, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The virus, for which there is no approved vaccine, is known to be endemic in Benin, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. But it also probably exists in other West African countries as well. Symptoms are usually gradual, starting with fever, general weakness and malaise. After a few days there may be headaches, sore throat, muscle pain, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, a cough and abdominal pain, according to the WHO. In severe cases there may be facial swelling, fluid in the lung cavity, bleeding from the mouth, nose, vagina or gastrointestinal tract and low blood pressure. Deafness occurs in 25% of recovered patients. In half of these cases, hearing returns partially after one to three months. Humans can contract Lassa fever from eating food that has been tainted by the urine or faeces of rodents. The virus can also be spread through contact with the body fluids of a sick person, but it does not spread easily between humans. According to the WHO, there is no epidemiological evidence supporting airborne spread from person to person. Imported cases rarely occur elsewhere in the world. Such cases are almost exclusively in people who work in endemic areas in high-risk occupations such as medicine. Most people with Lassa fever will make a full recovery although severe illness can occur. The overall case-fatality rate is 1%, according to the WHO. But the observed case-fatality rate among patients who are admitted to hospital with severe cases of Lassa fever is 15%. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival chances. The virus was first formally identified in Nigeria in 1969 and no cases were reported in the UK until the 1980s. Since then, there have been 11 confirmed cases in total, including the three cases identified in the last few days. These cases are the first to have been confirmed in the UK since 2009. Four people have now died from the virus in the UK since 2000, the UK Health Security Agency said. One died in 2000, two died in 2009 and the fourth death was confirmed on Friday. Two cases of the virus were discovered in the east of England on Wednesday. A third was confirmed on Friday in a Bedfordshire hospital but the patient, reported to be a newborn baby, died. The UKHSA said the risk to the public “remains very low”.",News/Science,Lassa fever: what are the symptoms and is it easy to catch?,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/12/lassa-fever-what-are-the-symptoms-and-is-it-easy-to-catch
2/16/2022,"My friend Hanef Bhamjee, who has died aged 74, devoted most of his life to trying to bring down apartheid, first as an activist in South Africa and later from Wales, his adopted home. Hanef was born in Marikana, in the North West Province of South Africa, one of four sons of Suleman Bhamjee and Anisa (nee Varachia). He grew up in Pietermaritzburg, where his family ran a shoe shop, and attended Woodlands Indian high school.  In his teens Hanef was part of a politics study group and went on to found the Indian Youth Congress of Natal. As a young activist with the African National Congress he was arrested and interrogated a number of times. When the security services began to take a close interest in him, he left South Africa in 1965, aged 19, and spent some time in London supporting ANC leaders in exile and running political study groups. He studied social science at the University of Birmingham, graduating in 1971, and moved to Cardiff, where he had South African friends. He was then a lecturer in sociology at the University of Cardiff from the mid-1970s until the mid-80s, during which time his main focus was to strengthen anti-apartheid activity in Wales. In 1981 Hanef founded the Welsh Anti-Apartheid Movement, becoming its secretary. A fearsome campaigner who created alliances across religious and Welsh language groups, political parties and trade unions , he inspired thousands to join the movement. Hanef’s house was WAAM’s office for years, and anyone visiting had to tread over mountains of papers. WAAM battled for years to persuade the Welsh Rugby Union to sever links with the South African game, which it eventually did in 1989. In the 80s Hanef decided to switch careers and began working as a paralegal for law firms. He studied law at the University of Cardiff and qualified as a solicitor in 1996, aged 50, afterwards working for Crowley and Co solicitors as an immigration specialist. In 1992, in the dying months of the apartheid era, a colleague and I made a film for HTV Wales about Hanef’s return to South Africa after 27 years in exile. On arrival in Pietermaritzburg, he went straight to the cemetery to visit the grave of his father, who died in 1974, and that of a close friend who had died under police torture. Standing in the graveyard, this tough campaigner was overcome by the suppressed emotions of a lifetime’s sacrifice. Once back in Wales, Hanef devoted his efforts to Action for Southern Africa Cymru, the successor to WAAM, which fundraises for anti-poverty projects. He was made OBE in 2012, the year he retired from legal work. Hanef loved watching cricket, collecting coins and medals, cooking vast meals for parties at his home, and doing the Guardian crossword. He was a warm and loyal friend to many and a devoted stepfather to Robyn and Luke, the children of his former partner, Annie Griffiths. He is survived by his brothers, Shabier and Yusuf.",News/World news,Hanef Bhamjee obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/16/hanef-bhamjee-obituary
2/16/2022,"Good morning. A video of a handful of screeching tanks and lumbering armoured vehicles mounting a transport train in Crimea accompanied the Russian defence ministry’s trumpeted announcement that some of the forces that have been encircling Ukraine will “head for their garrisons”, writes Dan Sabbagh.  Such evidence is clearly far too tentative to amount to anything definitive, however, and many are sceptical about the pledge to withdraw. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said this morning the alliance had not seen any evidence of a Russian withdrawal. Meanwhile, Joe Biden has claimed that 150,000 Russian troops remain in a “threatening position” around Ukraine, despite Russian claims of a withdrawal, and warned that an invasion “remains distinctly possible”. On Wednesday morning, Stoltenberg said Russia was building up its military forces on Ukraine’s border with more troops on their way, contradicting Moscow’s claims of a drawdown. What else did Biden say in his speech on Ukraine? Biden addressed the American people directly, telling them he was not going to “pretend this will be painless” and that they would feel it at the petrol pump. What’s happening today? Nato defence ministers are meeting in Brussels today. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, will join Stoltenberg and others to consider next steps amid tensions in eastern Europe. US attorneys representing victims of Jeffrey Epstein have hailed Tuesday’s settlement between Prince Andrew and Virginia Giuffre as a “victory” for survivors, with one claiming the royal’s “arrogance” stood in the way of settling sooner. Giuffre filed a civil lawsuit against the Duke of York in New York last year, accusing the prince of sexually abusing her when she was 17. The move represents a remarkable turnaround for the duke, who has always denied having a sexual relationship with Giuffre and had vowed to clear his name in court. “It’s another banner day for the survivors,” Robert Lewis, a New York-based lawyer for Sarah Ransome, who was abused at the age of 22 and settled a lawsuit with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2018, told the Guardian. Meanwhile, Prince Andrew is facing fresh calls to be stripped of his Duke of York title. The Queen last month stripped Andrew of his military affiliations and royal patronages in an attempt to distance the royal family from the allegations. However, he has kept his Duke of York title. Here’s how the British press reacted to the news of the settlement, which gives an indication of how people in the UK feel. The House select committee investigating the Capitol attack issued subpoenas yesterday to top Trump campaign and Republican officials involved in the scheme to send false electors for Donald Trump in states won by Joe Biden, as it examines the coordination behind the effort. The panel sent subpoenas to six individuals who were involved in a brazen attempt to meet and submit fake electoral college certificates that formed the backbone of a Trump-connected scheme to have Congress return the former president to office. Congressman Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the select committee, suggested in a statement that the subpoenas aimed to compel cooperation from the key actors about whether the Trump White House oversaw the effort to have “alternate electors” participate in the scheme. What did Thompson say? He said: “We’re seeking records and testimony from former campaign officials and other individuals in various states who we believe have relevant information about the planning and implementation of those plans.” Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin lost her libel lawsuit against the New York Times when a jury rejected her claim that the newspaper had maliciously damaged her reputation by erroneously linking her campaign rhetoric to a mass shooting. Rental prices across the US have soared over the past year, with some cities experiencing average price rises of up to 40%, leaving many renters stunned and grappling with either having to move to be able to afford rent or pay significantly more. New Zealand has banned conversion practices after all but eight National party members voted in favour of the law. Conversion “therapy” refers to the practice, often by religious groups, of trying to “cure” people of their sexuality or gender expression. The International Olympic Committee has dismissed claims that a double standard was applied to US sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson compared with the Russian skater Kamila Valieva after both tested positive for a banned drug. The vast US coastline is being assailed by rapidly encroaching oceans, with up to 1ft of sea level rise expected in the next 30 years – an increase that equals the total rise seen over the past century, a major US federal government report has found. The seas are rising significantly faster around the US than the global average, a situation that will cause a “dramatic increase” in disastrous flooding. The Dictator’s Wife is a debut novel by Freya Berry which explores how tyrants deploy glamorous spouses to soften their image: velvet gloves to their iron fists. The book poses an important question: to what extent should such women be judged as complicit in their husbands’ regimes? They are often survivors of brutal patriarchy and lack genuine political power. But do they, too, have blood on their hands? The American west has spent the last two decades in what scientists are now saying is the most extreme megadrought in at least 1,200 years. In a new study, published on Monday, researchers also noted that human-caused climate change is a significant driver of the destructive conditions and offered a grim prognosis: even drier decades lie ahead. Turning up the temperature – the result of human-caused heating – has played a big part. Scientists at Harvard University have engineered an artificial fish whose flapping tail is powered by cells from a human heart, a groundbreaking project that has ignited hopes for the future of cardiac research. The scientists, in collaboration with Emory University, built the “biohybrid fish” using paper, plastic, gelatin and two strips of living heart muscle cells, the contractions of which pulled the fish’s tail from side to side and allowed it to swim.

2/16/2022,"People in Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north of England have been warned to brace themselves for travel disruption, power cuts and fallen trees as back-to-back storms were forecast to bring gusts of up to 90mph in exposed areas. John Swinney, Scotland’s deputy first minister, said the coming days would be “very challenging” and urged everyone to plan their journeys in advance, exercise caution on the roads, and follow the latest travel advice.  ScotRail said as a safety precaution the vast majority of services would end at 4pm on Wednesday, the estimated start date of Storm Dudley. Avanti West Coast urged passengers travelling north of Preston to do so before 4pm and said ticket restrictions would be removed. Wednesday tickets could be used on Thursday, it said. The Met Office issued an amber weather warning for Dudley from 4pm to midnight. That included “injuries and danger to life” from large waves and beach material being thrown on to coastal roads and seafronts. The strong westerly winds were expected to hit south-west Scotland and northern parts of Northern Ireland before extending across southern Scotland and northern England. Forecasters were uncertain about the timing and location of the strongest gusts but inland speeds of 60-70mph were likely and “perhaps briefly up to 80mph in a few places”. Exposed coasts and hills could be battered by gusts up to 90mph. Scotland and northern England may get the worst of the stormy weather but a yellow warning for very strong winds from Storm Dudley was also issued for the Midlands, Wales and parts of East Anglia. After Dudley would come Storm Eunice, expected from Thursday afternoon to Friday evening. A yellow wind warning for Eunice was in place across all of England, Wales, Northern Ireland and southern Scotland. Power firms said they were prepared after storms Arwen, Malik and Corrie caused widespread power cuts. Northern Powergrid said there was a relatively high likelihood of disruption to power supplies. Paul Glendinning, the director of policy and markets, said the company had ensured resources were in place to respond to the storms. “Our network control engineers have capability to restore power supplies remotely, switching electricity through alternative routes on our network wherever possible to get customers back on supply,” he said. “In parallel our frontline workforce will be deployed to carry out local switching and repairs to restore power as safely and quickly as the conditions allow.” Northumberland fire and rescue service urged people to be prepared. That included having batteries for torches and radios and some food that did not need cooking, charging phones and checking in on elderly and disabled neighbours. The chief fire officer, Paul Hedley, advised residents not to go out in the storms unless it was absolutely necessary. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution asked people to stay well back from stormy seas and cliff edges. The east coast train operator LNER said damage to overhead lines had led to the cancellation of a number of trains between Leeds and London on Wednesday.

2/16/2022,"Brittany Dawn Davis, a fitness and Christianity influencer from Fort Worth, is being sued by the state of Texas for promising her followers personalized exercise and nutrition plans that never materialized. Davis’s website promised unsuspecting clients that her Brittany Dawn Fitness (BDF) crew would be with them “every step of the way”, but instead her followers received a generic diet and workout plan not unique to them. The state believes this amounts to “deceptive trade practices” and is seeking damages from $250,000 up to $1m.  Davis, who has almost 1 million TikTok followers, became a lifestyle influencer after competing in “bikini competitions”, bodybuilding events where the contestants stay in swimsuits. She launched her business, bdawnfit.com, in March 2014 claiming it promoted a holistic approach to health, including “flexible dieting, effective training, balanced living, and community support”. Davis sold custom fitness and diet plans, priced between $92 and $300, as well as her own personal time to each client, but after speaking with one another, clients realized they were given similar or identical plans, and never had face-time with the fitness coach. When they complained on Instagram, some said Davis deleted their comments. A Brittany Dawn sample meal plan found on Dawn’s Pinterest includes instructions for what to eat Monday through Wednesday. Breakfast on this plan is some variety of “1 scoop isolate protein, 1/2 cup of oats, and 1 whole egg.” Lunch and dinner is a protein like chicken or fish and “green veggies”. Cori Reali, one of Davis’s clients in Wisconsin, who suffered from an eating disorder, told Dallas’s WFAA that she paid $115 for one of Davis’s customized plans but said she never received specific guidance. “The red flags started to go up. I was not individualized. I was not part of this ‘Team Brittany Dawn’. It set me back. It actually pushed me back into my eating disorder.” By 2019, those who claimed they had been scammed by Davis began contacting each other on Facebook. A petition to “Stop Brittany Dawn [Davis] Fitness Scams” was created, which has now amassed over 15,000 signatures. It claimed that Davis “falsely promotes women empowerment on her social media platforms, while continually scamming and lying to her followers, clients, and fans”. In a now-deleted apology video posted to YouTube, Davis said: “I apologize to anyone who feels like they got scammed from me … I now realize that I should have had more help and that this is a lesson that I am having to learn the hard way, and for that, I am sorry.” Her fitness website is still active, but the Better Business Bureau has placed it on alert. It’s not currently possible to purchase any fitness plans. However, despite her apologies, Davis’s customer service team did not offer her customers full refunds. Davis said she would offer partial-to-full refunds to some customers, but first asked them to sign non-disclosure agreements. Davis did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. Davis has since pivoted to lifestyle and religious content. She now hosts Christian retreats in different cities across Texas and charges $125 for admission. These retreats promise a “gospel centered day with other God-fearing women”, according to her website. Davis says it will be a space where attendees “will be sharing our hearts on preparing for difficult seasons, staying faithful on your walk with the Lord, and how our seasons of difficulty often lead to our Kingdom calling”. She continues to post on Instagram most days and two weeks ago she announced to her about 466,000 followers, “the long hair went away yesterday, short-haired Britt is BACK”.",News/US news,Lifestyle influencer sued by Texas state for bogus meal plans,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/16/lifestyle-influencer-sued-texas-brittany-dawn-davis
2/16/2022,"Did something change this month? Having proclaimed the Brexit referendum triumph of 2016 as the unique achievement of Boris Johnson and praised his historic success in the election three years later with the slogan “get Brexit done”, did the wreckers of the European dream slowly begin to realise that if Johnson goes, it shifts the sands from beneath their feet? I’m the president of European Movement – Andrew Adonis is chair – and between us we agreed that this link needed a public airing. Learning from the direct and simple messaging of the anti-European newspapers, we felt the phrase: “If Boris goes, Brexit goes” said it clearly enough. Adonis duly tweeted it, to the horror of the pro-Brexit press.  The past few weeks have been a torrid time for the prime minister. He designed a set of restrictions he said were of critical importance for our safety and for the ability of the NHS to cope with the pandemic. He was right to do so. But disclosures since give the clearest impression that he not only broke the rules, but that he also misled Parliament. Johnson said he would accept the findings of Sue Gray’s inquiry, in stark contrast to his treatment of Sir Alex Allan’s report into the home secretary’s behaviour in 2020. I believe he is entitled to insist that matters are not prejudged prior to the release of the full findings of the Gray inquiry, and the completion of the Metropolitan police investigation. I do not believe in the rule of the mob. But a great deal hangs on this. If the prime minister is found to have lied to parliament and to the people, what defence is there to the allegation that the Brexit cause – mired in similar controversy over lies and dissembling – was conducted with the same disregard for the truth? We all have a clear memory of the Brexit campaign and what was said. That we were being run by Brussels. That European restrictions were holding back our economy and lowering our living standards. That we could keep all the benefits of the single market and customs union, while negotiating trade deals with faster-growing countries in a world that was shifting east. That we had to regain control over our borders. That there would be no new border between Northern Ireland and mainland Great Britain, and that the Good Friday agreement, having ended years of strife, would be fully honoured Theresa May became prime minister and immediately handed important offices of state to the three leading Brexiters. Boris Johnson went to the Foreign Office. David Davis went to the Department for Exiting the European Union, and Liam Fox to the Department for International Trade. They had their hands on the levers of power for two years before Johnson and Davis resigned, claiming their jobs were impossible. Having ousted May, they claimed that a barebones trade deal – without most of the benefits of the customs union and the single market – was “oven ready” and would “get Brexit done”. In a straight contest with the unelectable Jeremy Corbyn, Johnson secured his mandate. Except their deal didn’t “get Brexit done”. Within months it had seriously frustrated trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and the government threatened to tear up the very deal it had itself negotiated to safeguard the position of Northern Ireland. Lord Frost resigned from the cabinet as Brexit minister last December after less than a year, complaining of the Covid strategy but also bemoaning that, regarding Brexit, the correct agenda was not being pursued. Characteristically he gave no detail as to what that agenda should have been or who was holding it up, but the villains were familiar: the metropolitan elite, the civil service, the BBC, Brussels, the remoaners – more or less anybody, and now including myself and Andrew Adonis. Everyone except the actual people in positions of power. That is why February 2022 feels so significant. The cry has been growing louder. The rightwing has been circling. Letters have been landing on the chairman of the 1922 committee’s desk. Something must be done. Reshuffle the pack, create a new government department and put yet another Brexiter in charge to pluck all those low-hanging plums that proved beyond the reach of predecessors. Anyone with experience of Whitehall knows what happens next. The nameplates will change and the same civil servants will have new titles without actually moving their offices. But they will face exactly the same questions that have now been unanswered for five years. What is Brexit all about? Jacob Rees-Mogg, Lord Frost’s spiritual successor in his new role as minister for Brexit opportunities, has a novel approach. He told the Sun last week that he is bypassing the civil service to ask if anyone else in the country has any ideas about Brexit benefits. Sun readers are invited to write to him with suggestions and he will see what can be done. But that too is revealing. One of the first tests officials apply to new ministers is to ask if they know what they want and to assess whether they have the ability to communicate that to them. I am afraid that Rees-Mogg has not passed this test, which is all the more surprising as he had plenty of time lounging on the government frontbench, listening to suggestions from Brexit-supporting Tory MPs. So did something happen in February 2022? Maybe it’s just a feeling, a cloud no bigger than a man’s fist, the first breath of wind before the storm when the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph employ two of their most renowned columnists to attack Andrew Adonis and myself, merely for making the point that their hero may have feet of clay and take the Brexit house down with him. Perhaps they have smelled the wind, just as I have.

2/16/2022,"When the United States’ Department of Homeland Security announced in early February it was training quadruped “robot dogs” to help secure the US-Mexico border, the department’s spokesperson described the nearly 2,000-mile region as “an inhospitable place for man and beast, and that is exactly why a machine may excel there”. But, of course, people do live, work, and try to eke out a living in this “inhospitable” desert space – leaving one to question what, exactly, the robot dog is meant to excel at?  The border has long been a testing ground for a range of emerging surveillance and policing technologies, which activists have argued make the space even more dangerous to migrants, all in the name of protection, law, and order. Nicknamed the “smart wall”, the tools used at the border include semi-autonomous surveillance drones and surveillance towers equipped with cameras and night vision, and radar. Former US congressman William Hurd, who represented the only Republican-held congressional district on the US-Mexico border for six years, endorsed a plan to bury fiber optic sensors capable of detecting underground movement. The robot dogs would be one of many technologies deployed as part of the “smart wall”, but they aren’t limited to the border. US police departments started trying out the devices in recent years. Massachusetts state police tested the robot dogs in 2019. Police in Honolulu used the same model to remotely screen its unhoused citizens for Covid and scan their temperatures. Police have used robots for decades, usually for remote monitoring or to respond to bomb threats. But reports of robot dogs draw fierce criticism, for several reasons. First, they’re debuting in public amid a nationwide discussion on police power. Also, they’re expensive, ranging anywhere between $90,000 and $150,000, when many are discussing police budgeting. They’re equipped with a host of AI-enabled surveillance devices, alarming privacy activists, and do terribly on social media because they bear an uncanny resemblance to the world-ending machines featured in Netflix’s dystopian satire Black Mirror. This played out last year, when the New York police department (NYPD) announced it would suspend its contract with Boston Dynamics, one of the main manufacturers of robot dogs, and return its Digidog after footage of the dog went viral on social media. John Miller, the police department’s deputy commissioner for intelligence and counter-terrorism, blamed “politics, bad information, and cheap soundbites.” In the Bronx neighborhood where NYPD deployed the robot, however, criticism of their use was based on their own experiences with police, rather than social media outrage. Councilmember Kevin Riley, who represented the neighborhood where NYPD deployed the robot, said residents had long complained that police were slow to respond to calls for service in the neighborhood and many felt ignored. When the robot dog appeared, people in the neighborhood were concerned this meant less human investment. They were afraid the robots were a substitute for sustained investment. Police and public service robots rarely replace their human counterparts, but removing the human element is always a fraught design decision, especially for the vulnerable groups interacting with them. The robots used by police and potentially on the border are semi-autonomous, meaning while they’re capable of maneuvering on their own, they are usually remotely controlled by a human. That distance can be useful. Consider the prototypes of police robots that would take over during traffic stops, potentially making them safer for police and motorists, or other early versions that saw robot dogs as functional canaries used to investigate potential gas leaks or downed power lines on oil rigs, construction sites and power plants. But it also makes people deeply uncomfortable. Each of these concerns came to the fore when DHS made its announcement, with some advocating for destroying the robot dogs outright. The version of the robot dog potentially coming to the south-western border is particularly dystopian, recalibrating the devices to be essentially roving sentries. Each is embedded with different types of cameras (thermal, night vision, long-range) and sensors (chemical, weapons detection). DHS praised the device’s ability to cross multiple terrains – including sand, rocks and hills – and its durability in high heat and cramped spaces. DHS’ choice of vendor sparked additional concern. While most police departments leased their pups from Boston Dynamics, which forbids customers weaponizing any of their tech, DHS chose Philadelphia-based Ghost Robotics. Late last year, the company debuted a version of its robot dogs equipped with long-range guns capable of hitting targets at a reported 1,200 meters. DHS’s oddly cheery blogpost also implied the robots would be used beyond the border itself, including “towns, cities, or ports’’ where DHS agents might encounter dangerous conditions. Federal officials have increased authority to stop and search civilians within 100 miles of the border, despite fourth amendment protections against arbitrary or excessive stops and seizures. A 2019 report from the Electronic Frontiers Foundation tracked the surveillance devices used in border towns across the US, including facial recognition, military drones, cell-site simulators, license plate readers, body cameras, and facial recognition. Human rights groups were, unsurprisingly, horrified. “We create the conditions forcing people into taking the journey here, and now we plan to meet them with robot dogs?” said Jacinta Gonzalez, senior campaign director at Mijente, a Latino advocacy and migrant rights group, to TRT World. Technology ethicists speak often of “mission creep”, wherein a specific technology or tactic is introduced for a single, specific purpose, then becomes normalized and introduced in new settings. Often this refers to the rise in military-grade equipment being funneled into US police departments, including the robot that Dallas police used to remote deliver and detonate a bomb in 2016, killing a sniper. Going from gas-leak detection to migrant-hunting tools, robot dogs appear to fit the mission creep definition, bringing us back to the original question: what exactly are border robot dogs built to accomplish? Perhaps maintaining and automating the US border’s inhospitable character rather than subverting it, is the answer.",News/US news,Dystopian robot dogs are the latest in a long history of US-Mexico border surveillance ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/16/robot-dogs-us-mexico-border-surveillance-technology
2/16/2022,"Created by Hephaestus and released into the world of men to bring both misery and hope, Pandora is a figure whose name conjures an expectation of mythic drama; but Susan Stokes-Chapman’s bestselling debut novel only hints gently at those possibilities. Her Pandora is a young woman living in an attic above her uncle’s shop of fake antiquities in 18th-century London, training herself to become a designer of fine jewellery. One day, her crooked uncle illegally salvages from a shipwreck a Greek vase so old it cannot be dated, carved with images from the Pandora myth, and wreathed in horrifying bad luck. The narrative ranges between young antiquarian Edward, Pandora herself, and her uncle Hezekiah to chart the disasters and mysteries that follow. It dances between painstaking realism and the softest chance of the supernatural, courting both but marrying neither in an elegant negotiation that admits very different readings.  Pandora is a narrator rather than a hero, observing with a cruel eye for detail that seeps into other characters’ narration, too – one London lane “teems like maggots in an open sore”, and the book is filled with people described as “fleshy” or with “too many chins”, or followed by the smell of rotting meat. Most of the time, it’s this vivid witnessing that defines Pandora. Her namesake opens the box, and bears the consequences; but this Pandora doesn’t take that kind of decisive action. Even the actions of her magpie, Hermes, have more of a plot impact than her own. There’s a sense that Pandora holds the moral high ground in this novel, not because she does good things but because she is suffering under her uncle’s tyranny. Virtue via suffering is apt for this time period, but it’s also a device that sometimes makes her bland. Meanwhile, her uncle is purely despicable – he too tends to be flat. Those clearcut, simple main players are plainly a creative decision, though, because Stokes-Chapman can write fascinating, three-dimensional characters; sharp, sad Cornelius Ashmole and the angrily tragic Lottie, Hezekiah’s housekeeper, haunt the periphery of the novel. Meanwhile, extensive research brings the period so much to life you can taste it. With a convoluted plot full of buried family histories and fantastical archaeological theories, Pandora is a readable, solid debut.

2/16/2022,"My friend Geoff Roberts, who has died aged 92, made his living as a teacher but had a large hinterland beyond his work in the classroom, including as a part-time illustrator and writer. Much of Geoff’s creative output came after his early retirement from teaching in the early 1980s – a long and fruitful period in which he became a writer of short stories and poems, some of which were published in Reach Poetry magazine.  When I was working as a freelance editor for Camra, the Campaign for Real Ale, in 1998, tasked with producing Room at the Inn, a guide to pubs offering bed and breakfast, and with no budget for a photographer, all I had to work with was poor quality photos sent in by the pubs themselves. Almost in despair I called upon Geoff, who worked his magic by providing wonderful line drawings, based on some of the photos, that really made the book. Just a few months before his death, Geoff’s talent as a novelist was recognised with the publication in 2021 of his Arthurian romance novel Swordsman of the Sun. Born in Ilford, Essex, to Hilda (nee Gilpin), a housewife, and Douglas, a partner in a London paper firm, Geoff, who was an only child, went to Watford grammar school and after national service studied English at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he met Helen Eames, who was studying at nearby Homerton College and whom he married in 1954. They both became English teachers, and Geoff taught at Sandbach school in Cheshire, Northampton grammar school and Cedars upper school in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire (where he was head of English), before becoming a teacher trainer at Weymouth College in Dorset. After Geoff took early retirement, he and Helen moved to the village of Saint-Orens-Pouy-Petit in south-west France, where I and my husband, Stephen, had a holiday home. They were freezing in their poorly insulated house, but their “lives were saved”, as Geoff often recalled, by the villagers, who kept them supplied with stumps from old vines to burn in their stove. Thus they established friendships with local families, in particular the Plantés, that endured until the end of his life. Geoff delighted friends and families each Christmas with cards featuring his drawings of a local château or other landmark, and I will always treasure the final one from Christmas 2020 that depicted my own house. He was a keen tennis player, and appeared regularly on court well into his 80s. He was also a huge rugby fan, and friends learned not to drop in when a big match was on television. Watching sport helped sustain him through increasingly regular spells in hospital in his final years. He is survived by Helen, their son, Steve, and two grandchildren Sophie and Aidan. Another son, Andy, died following a hit and run accident in London in 2005; a circumstance to which Geoff was never truly reconciled.",Arts/Art and design,Geoff Roberts obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/16/geoff-roberts-obituary
2/16/2022,"Russia is building up its military forces on Ukraine’s border with more troops on their way, contradicting Moscow’s claims of a drawdown, Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said. Despite suggestions from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Tuesday that a “partial” withdrawal was in effect, Stoltenberg warned that Russian military capability was only increasing in number and strength.  The former Norwegian prime minister said Nato needed to be “prepared for the worst” while holding out hope that the signalling from Putin in recent days was evidence of a sincere desire to find a diplomatic way through the crisis. Before a two-day meeting of Nato’s 30 defence ministers, Stoltenberg told reporters at the alliance’s headquarters in Brussels: “So far we have not seen any de-escalation on the ground. On the contrary, it appears that Russia continues the military buildup. “We are, of course, monitoring very closely what Russia does in and around Ukraine. What we see is that they have increased the number of troops and more troops are on their way and so, so far, no de-escalation. “But of course, we hear all the messages about diplomacy and we are ready to engage in diplomatic efforts with Russia.” Stoltenberg said, however, the evidence on the ground “contradicts the message of real diplomatic efforts”. During a press conference with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in Moscow on Tuesday, Putin told reporters that he was undertaking “a partial withdrawal of troops from the areas of our exercises”, adding: “What is there to comment on?” There has been widespread scepticism about the claims, with the US president, Joe Biden, saying in an address on Tuesday that he believed that more than 150,000 Russian troops remained near Ukraine’s borders, more than 60% of the country’s ground forces. Stoltenberg would not give a definitive number with regard to the size of the Russian presence on Wednesday, noting that the Kremlin pulled troops back and forth over time. He added, however, that the capability on the border was sufficient to launch a successful “fully fledged” invasion without notice. “I have talked about well over 100,000, but there has been that steady increase,” he said. “So we are seeing that it goes up and up and up – and it continues to increase. So I think that the most important thing now is to closely monitor what Russia does and we really call on them to do what they say, and that is to de-escalate, to withdraw forces. “Of course, what we’ve seen several times over the last months is that they move in with a high number of troops and heavy equipment. Then they take most of the troops out again but the equipment stays. Then they can very easily, very quickly, send the personnel back again and they are operating up with all the capabilities in place.” Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand, echoed the analysis as she arrived for the talks in Brussels. “The escalation of Russian troops at the Ukrainian border, including in Belarus, is increasingly significant,” she said. “We look forward to seeing evidence of the withdrawal of troops on Russia’s part. But we need to prepare for any eventuality with that significant escalation of Russian troops that we have seen over the last weeks.” After his trip to Moscow, Scholz had suggested that a war over Ukraine’s right to join Nato was a folly, given the unlikelihood of it happening during Putin’s term in office. Stoltenberg said: “My message is that this is for 30 allies to decide. Russia is not deciding who’s going to be a member of Nato or not. And this is a matter of principle that all our allies have stated clearly again, and again.”",News/World news,"Russia still building forces on Ukraine border, says top Nato official",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/16/russia-still-building-forces-on-ukraine-border-says-top-nato-official
2/16/2022,"The United States’ improbable, unbeaten run through the Olympic men’s ice hockey tournament came to a devastating halt at the quarter-final stage on Wednesday with a 3-2 penalty shootout defeat to Slovakia. The youngest US men’s Olympic team in decades appeared bound for the semi-finals after coming from behind for a third straight contest to lead 2-1 with under a minute remaining. But Slovakian captain Marek Hrivic scored a game-tying goal with 43.7 seconds left and Peter Cehlarik broke a stalemate in the decisive shootout that followed a scoreless overtime period.  Slovakian goaltender Patrik Rybar, who made 33 saves in the match, was mobbed by his teammates in front of the goal after turning away Andy Miele’s final attempt in the shootout as the US team looked on in stunned silence. “It’s the medal round and you’re going to get every team’s best,” said Miele, the USA captain who fought through tears while fielding questions in the mixed zone. “They put up a lot of shots and he made a lot of big saves. We didn’t find a way to score more goals. It just comes down to that.” The Americans arrived in Beijing with the youngest roster in the 12-team tournament, a group including 15 college students and five teenagers hastily assembled after the NHL withdrew from Olympic participation in December due to the spread of the Omicron variant, and a team who didn’t skate together until a few weeks ago. But the US team upended expectations by winning all three of their preliminary-round games to earn top seeding in the quarter-finals, stirring up the echoes of the ragtag group of fuzzy-faced amateurs who stormed through the Olympic tournament in 1980, upsetting the heavily favoured Soviet Union along the way in the storied Miracle on Ice. Team USA’s top seeding earned them an extra day of rest over Slovakia, who took the ice for Wednesday’s quarter-final less than 24 hours after Tuesday’s qualification play-off win over Germany. It appeared to show in the early stages as the Americans got off to a flying start, forechecking with high intensity and rattling off the first five shots on goal. But it was Slovakia’s Juraj Slafkovsky who drew first blood midway through the opening frame, drifting into the slot and firing a left-handed missile into the back of the net for his fifth goal of the tournament. Undeterred after having conceded the opening goal in their previous two wins against Canada and Germany, the US equalized with less than a minute to go in the opening period when Harvard junior Nick Abruzzese made a slick move in front of the goal before poking it through Rybar’s legs. The Americans then nosed ahead midway through the second period when the St Cloud State University senior Sam Hentges opened his Olympic account. “They played outstanding this entire tournament,” USA defenseman and alternate captain Steven Kampfer said of the college players who made up more than half of the team’s roster. “These young guys have a great future ahead of them and I think they know that. They’ve just got to continue to work hard but the sky is the limit for these kids and that was evident in this tournament as it went on.” The American lead stood until the final minute when Hrivic, formerly of the NHL’s New York Rangers and Calgary Flames, knocked a loose puck past USA goalie Strauss Mann with Slovakia staring down elimination and their goaltender off the ice, leaving Team USA to rue to their failure to cash in on three power-play opportunities in the third period, one of them a five-on-three advantage. “That was really tough,” Kampfer said. “I thought we did a good job until that point, we did a good job defending. We knew that they were finding a lot of pucks to the net at the end and there’s one that gets free and they get a stick on it. They tie the game and got a little momentum.” The US were forced to regroup quickly for the 10–minute sudden-death overtime period where both sides exchanged scoring chances but neither could break through. Only Cehlarik managed to find the back of the net in the best-of-five shootout as Rybar turned away all five American attempts. “We couldn’t find a way to get it by him,” Miele said. “He’s an aggressive goalie and he did well tonight.” University of Minnesota forward Ben Meyers added: “We played really well in our first three games and this is our first bad game. Now we are done. I have no complaints at all about anything. I’m just disappointed that we lost this time.” Mann, the 23-year-old University of Michigan product who finished with 34 saves in the losing effort, was among several US players both overcome by emotion after the shock defeat but grateful for the unexpected journey. “It was amazing,” Mann said. “It is probably the biggest honour of my life to represent our country, play on the Olympic stage and just be a part of something bigger than hockey. To get to know a lot of great guys, fill those relationships that will last a lifetime and help unite the country a little bit.”",Sport/Sport,Ice hockey: US men suffer shootout defeat to Slovakia at Winter Olympics,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/16/ice-hockey-usa-slovakia-winter-olympics-beijing
2/16/2022,"My brother John Sawyer, who has died aged 86, was a linguist and Old Testament scholar with an incisive and imaginative mind. He was one of the first to apply what is now referred to as “reception history” to a study of the Bible – looking at how it has been interpreted by different readers over the centuries. John was born in Inchinnan, Renfrewshire, to Beatrice (nee Fergusson), a writer, and the Rev Alek Sawyer, a Church of Scotland minister. Our family moved to Dunbar in 1938, and then, with our father in the services, spent much of the second world war years with my grandmother in Edinburgh, where John attended George Watson’s boys’ college, and found that languages were his forte. He went to Edinburgh University to study classics, graduating with first-class honours in 1957.  His national service with the Royal Scots saw him working as an interpreter in Cyprus, where he also became fluent in Turkish and started studying Hebrew. He then decided to enter the ministry. John graduated with a BD from Edinburgh in 1962, having been excused the Hebrew class in favour of one in Arabic. After an 18-month fellowship in Jerusalem, he returned to a lectureship at the University of Glasgow, where he was ordained in 1964 as a chaplain. He moved to the University of Newcastle in 1965, where over the next 29 years, eventually promoted to professor and head of the department of religious studies, he wrote a Hebrew grammar, a two-volume commentary on Isaiah, two editions of Prophecy and the Biblical Prophets (1987), and 50 research papers on language and religion. A move to Lancaster University in 1994 coincided with the publication of perhaps his best-known book, The Fifth Gospel – Isaiah in the History of Christianity (1996). In 2002 he moved to Perugia University in Italy and became editor in chief of the Blackwell Bible Commentary, also singing in the university choir. His research during these years at Perugia also produced A Concise Dictionary of the Bible and its Reception (2009). He returned to Northumberland in 2012 and wrote The Bible in Music (2015), also taking part in choral singing in Alnwick. His published legacy includes nine books, eight edited books or series and more than 100 papers, reviews and notes. John’s involvement with inter-faith groups in Glasgow, Perugia and especially in Newcastle led him, uniquely, into honorary membership of the Newcastle Reformed Synagogue. John married three times: his first two marriages, to Rosemary Larmuth in 1965 and Deborah Lilburn in 1990, ended in divorce. He is survived by his third wife, Jean (nee Aaron-Walker), whom he married in 2012, four children – Alexander, Hannah and Sarah from his first marriage and Joseph from his second – and five grandchildren.",Arts/Books,John Sawyer obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/16/john-sawyer-obituary
2/16/2022,"Ministers’ plans to scale back free PCR Covid tests could weaken the UK’s defences if a new variant of the virus emerges that results in “significant new waves” of cases, a group representing local public health chiefs has warned. Before a meeting of cabinet ministers and the prime minister later this week to discuss the “learning to live with Covid” strategy, the Association of Public Health Directors (APHD) said that forcing people to pay for lateral flow tests would also have a “detrimental impact” on take-up, particularly among disadvantaged communities.  The group said that despite the government being expected to roll back the last remaining Covid laws from next week, coronavirus was “yet to become endemic”, and added it was “difficult to predict when this state may be attained”. “Significant levels of cases, hospitalisations and deaths continue to disrupt and devastate individuals, public services and the economy,” a briefing note said. “There remains a degree of unpredictability about the course ahead.” Whitehall sources told the Guardian on Monday that ministers were pressing ahead with plans to start winding down Covid testing and payments for isolation from next week to save more than £10bn. In a veiled criticism of Boris Johnson, given his investigation by the Metropolitan police for allegedly attending a series of lockdown-breaking parties, the ADPH said political leaders had “a responsibility to model good behaviour and foster an environment of trust and collective spirit”. While the group said it wanted to “avoid strict measures and lockdowns”, it called on Johnson to “chart a sensible path between the extremes of lockdowns and letting the virus rip”. The ADPH said: “Oscillating harms businesses and disrupts public services more than a course of action to keep infection rates more stable.” Concern was also raised about the ability of councils and other community organisations to continue running local contact-tracing operations, if the national test and trace service is pared back significantly. “Unless additional resources is available, capacity to do any contact-tracing at a local authority level will be extremely limited and in many areas nonexistent,” the ADPH said. It also said that even when the legal requirement for someone to isolate if they have Covid is dropped, “it will still be the case that this is sensible public health advice”. Employers were urged to help “by creating a culture in which coming to work when ill, whether with Covid-19 or the flu, is discouraged and considered not in the interests of the individual concerned, their colleagues or customers”. Where outbreaks happen in schools and care homes, the ADPH recommended that infection prevention “will continue to be appropriate for these settings, though the thresholds for intervention are likely to be higher”. In care homes, the ADPH said mask wearing should increase when an outbreak occurs and more antiviral treatment be made available. It advised that, where it is found that Covid is being transmitted in schools, there should be a “short-term return to mask wearing at least in secondary settings”. After reports that the ONS’ infection survey could be scrapped, the ADPH argued it “should be retained”. The Department of Health and Social Care was contacted for comment. A government spokesperson said this week that free testing was kept “under review” but insisted “no decisions have been made on the provision of free testing”. The spokesperson added: “Everyone can continue to get free tests and we are continuing to encourage people to use rapid tests when they need them. “Testing continues to play an important role in helping people live their day-to-day lives, keep businesses running and keep young people in school.”",News/World news,"Scaling back free Covid tests could hinder UK if new variant emerges, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/16/scaling-back-free-covid-tests-could-hinder-uk-if-new-variant-strikes-say-health-chiefs
