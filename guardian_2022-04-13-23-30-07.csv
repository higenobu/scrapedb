4/13/2022,"Interest rates on student loans are set to soar to as high as 12%, costing higher-earning graduates an extra £3,000 unless the government intervenes, according to the Institute for Fiscal Students. Interest rates on post-2012 student loans are based on the retail prices index (RPI), with the rise in the RPI in March meaning most recent graduates in England and Wales will be charged 9% from September, up from the current rate of 1.5%. The IFS analysis found that higher-earning graduates will be most directly affected by the increase, since they are more likely to repay their entire loan within 30 years of graduation. Other graduates will see any outstanding balance wiped after 30 years. Highly paid graduates – those earning more than £49,130 – are charged an additional three percentage points (v low earners), so interest rates on their loans will rise from 4.5% to 12%. Those with student loans of £50,000 will accrue an extra £3,000 in debt until March 2023, when interest rates are next revised. Ben Waltmann, senior research economist at the IFS, said: “Unless the government changes the way student loan interest is determined, there will be wild swings in the interest rate over the next three years. “The maximum rate will reach an eye-watering level of 12% between September 2022 and February 2023 and a low of around zero between September 2024 and March 2025. “There is no good economic reason for this. Interest rates on student loans should be low and stable, reflecting the government’s own cost of borrowing. The government urgently needs to adjust the way the interest rate cap operates to avoid a significant spike in September.” The National Union of Students (NUS) said the increases were “brutal” and likely to add thousands of pounds to graduate loans at a time when many were struggling. “Students aren’t cash cows, and we can’t keep taking the brunt of this government’s regressive actions that have left millions exposed to hardship,” said Hillary Gyebi-Ababio, NUS vice-president for higher education, who wants the government to reverse the changes. Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, said the increases were another symptom of the cost of living crisis. “As working graduates battle rising prices and the chancellor’s growing tax burden, soaring interest rates risk piling on more pressure,” Phillipson said. A spokesperson for the Department for Education said student loans differed from commercial loans, with repayments linked to income, not to interest rates or the amounts borrowed. They stressed that borrowers earning below the threshold of £27,275 a year before tax make no repayments. “The IFS report makes it clear that changes in interest rates have a limited long-term impact on repayments, and the Office for Budget Responsibility predict that RPI will be below 3% in 2024,” the DfE spokesperson said. “Regardless, the government has cut interest rates for new borrowers so from 2023-24, graduates will never have to pay back more than they borrowed in real terms.” The government’s recent overhaul of student loans will from 2023 extend payments to 40 years instead of 30, and bring in lower starting thresholds for repayments that are likely to cost lower and middle income graduates an extra £30,000 across their lifetimes. Students who start courses in 2023 to 2024, and who go on to earn £50,000 or more, will save about £20,000 compared with the current loan system because of lower interest rates.",News/Education,Graduates to be hit with ‘brutal’ student loan interest rates of up to 12%,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/13/graduates-to-be-hit-with-brutal-student-loan-interest-rates-of-up-to-12
4/13/2022,"In May 2020, David Wilson received a £1,000 fine after hosting an outdoor party he says followed coronavirus rules at his restaurant, Calypso, in Blackburn. He’s still fighting the fine in court, and is terrified that if his case fails and he’s asked to pay, he’ll be forced to close an 11-year-old family business that delivered food to vulnerable people during the pandemic. This, he said, was the reality for “the small man”, contrasting his experience with that of the prime minister and his associates, who have been fined for attending parties at 10 Downing Street during lockdown. “A £1,000 fine for us, £50 for them. It’s a joke. Where’s the justice? Apart from anger, I’m disappointed, because they’re playing it off thinking it’ll go away, it’s just a £50 fine. All the way through they’ve been having parties, when how many people were suffering who couldn’t see family or grandkids? I broke down crying seeing so much need from the people we were serving.” His anger at the contrasting pandemic experiences was echoed by Callum Harrison, who received a fine for having two friends round his eight-person houseshare in October 2020, while he was still a student at Newcastle University. He recalls very heavy-handed “authoritarian” policing, with undercover cars and intimidating patrols in areas where lots of students lived. “The police were very aggressive, very hostile to us, even though we tried to reason with them and said it’s our first time breaking the rules.” Each person present received a £100 fine, which he said represented “a few weeks of food” to him. He feels that, in light of the government’s breaches, fines people paid should be donated to charity. “It feels like one rule for us, one for them. They get away with murder constantly, the government should be ashamed of themselves. Looking back and the people who were supposed to be setting an example and who set the rules, they had numerous parties, it’s just not fair,” he said. Kieron McArdle, who received a £100 fine during the first lockdown after three friends visited him in his garden in Warwickshire for his birthday after he had spent weeks alone, considers the lies the worst aspect of the partygate scandal. “It was the total disregard for other people and the lies that got me – there were no parties, there were no parties. The original line was that it was all work meetings. I could have said to the police the three guys here are my colleagues,” he said. “For the prime minister to lie in parliament, he’s broken the ministerial code, he’s got to go. He must resign. He’s got no credibility, he’s become a laughing stock.” Ali Lawrence, a musician from York who was fined £200 despite showing police print-outs of the coronavirus rules he believed showed he was in line with the law, worried about the precedent Johnson’s behaviour might set. “The big excuse is that we can’t change our leader because of the war in Ukraine. But the way I see things is that, with all the atrocities in Ukraine committed by Putin, he’s obviously lying and everyone can see that. But how can the leader of our country call him out, when he’s been proven to have done the same? It makes a mockery of it all. We need a leader who has to at least be seen to be honourable.”",News/Politics,‘It’s a joke’: Britons who received Covid fines react to Boris Johnson’s £50 penalty,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/13/covid-fines-partygate-boris-johnson-rishi-sunak
4/13/2022,"The UK government has imposed sanctions on another 206 individuals in response to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, including 178 people it said were involved in propping up the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, said the latest sanctions were imposed in a direct response to the “horrific rocket attacks” on a train station in Kramatorsk, eastern Ukraine, that killed dozens of civilians. “In the wake of horrific rocket attacks on civilians in eastern Ukraine, we are today sanctioning those who prop up the illegal breakaway regions and are complicit in atrocities against the Ukrainian people,” Truss said. “We will continue to target all those who aid and abet Putin’s war. We will not rest in our mission to stop Putin’s war machine in its tracks.” The sanctions are being coordinated with the EU, the Foreign Office said. Those hit by the fresh sanctions include Alexander Ananchenko and Sergey Kozlov, the self-styled prime minister and chair of government of the self-proclaimed breakaway republics of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Other notable figures added to the list include: Vladimir Yakunin, a former head of Russian Railways who the Foreign Office said had close ties to Putin. The US had already imposed sanctions on Yakunin. Igor Kesaev, the founder of the cigarette company Megapolis, who the UK says has a £2.9bn fortune. Saodat Narzieva, “a pro-Kremlin oligarch with close ties to Putin” and a sister of Alisher Usmanov. She was hit with EU sanctions last week. Additional family members and staff of Russian oligarchs already facing sanctions were also added to the list, including Pavel Ezubov, a cousin of Oleg Deripaska, and Nigina Zairova, an executive assistant to Mikhail Fridman. The UK announced it would ban the import of Russian iron and steel from Friday. Truss said Britain would also prohibit “the export of quantum technologies and advanced materials that Putin sorely needs”.",News/World news,UK imposes sanctions on another 206 Russians after Ukraine railway attack,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/uk-imposes-sanctions-russians-ukraine-railway-attack
4/13/2022,"Growing up on a council estate in High Wycombe in the late 1970s, skinhead culture just spoke to me. It was all about camaraderie, fashion and music. We were listening to 2 Tone bands such as the Specials and aping what Madness wore on their album covers. Back then I was heavy-handed, angry and rough around the edges, and there was a definite suppression of anger in the lyrics of the bands we were listening to. I liked the attention that being a skinhead got me, too. School was a nightmare for me. I loved art but couldn’t transfer what was in my head to the page, which caused me massive frustration. But in 1979, aged 14, I went to Woolies to buy a pair of binoculars and got a camera instead – a little 110 Hanimex. Getting my first set of prints developed was a life-changing moment. I remember the voice in my head: “I’m going to be a photographer.” That was it. I never wavered. I would get my mates to nick camera film from Boots for me because I was too scared. The only downside was that anywhere I went, I’d get: “Oh, look who it is, David Bailey.” A year after getting the camera, I started photographing skinheads. There are no strangers in my photos: they’re my schoolmates, my girlfriends, my mum and dad and my younger brother Neville, who was a skinhead too and extremely stylish, refined and sophisticated. I managed to make the people I loved – normal people – into stars. This is a photo of my mate Skinny Jim on the tube in 1980. There were six of us, all aged 15. We’d taken the train down to London on a rainy day to go to Carnaby Street and get a Harrington jacket – or whatever we could afford for a tenner. It was an away day and I’d taken my camera, like I normally did. Skinny Jim was one of those 15-year-old kids who think they are the hardest because they haven’t been punched on the nose yet. That expression is Skinny Jim all over. My God, what a face. London was scary back then. We had to keep our heads down. There were gangs roaming. You couldn’t go anywhere without getting your head kicked in. But I was never intimidated. I was six foot tall and I remember using my Hanimex as a weapon when some bloke tried to get funny with me in Trafalgar Square. He got it over the head. That picture is perfect. I’m not blowing my own trumpet, but I stare at it myself and it’s up there with anything that any of the big boys have done. I’ve seen so many variations of my skinhead photos over the last 30 years, but everything is so contrived and they all use models. I was in a tiny little gang on a tiny little council estate, in a tiny little town that no one had ever heard of at the time, taking pictures I thought no one would ever see just because I enjoyed doing it. So there’s an honesty to it, and that’s where the power lies. There is no narrative attached. What blows my mind is that I was only 15 years old when I took that photo, on a moving tube train. It’s the level of confidence. Something very strange was going on, that I came out as such a confident photographer when I was so insecure at the same time. If you talk to most people about skinheads, they think it’s about the right-wing and Nazis. The demonisation was continuous. But the skinhead movement, when it started, came out of the philosophy of black and white kids uniting and dancing to 60s ska music from Jamaica. That’s where my photographs come in. Because when I do exhibitions, people usually come in tight-lipped, expecting to see fat, balding 30-year-olds with bulldogs. But if you’re at a gig dancing to ska music – that’s a skinhead. Simple as that. I don’t know what happened to Skinny Jim. No one bloody knows. I heard he went off and invented stuff. I heard that somebody bumped into him the other day on Facebook and they said he was a lovely bloke, involved in charity. Somebody else said he was dead. So I don’t know. I would never have remembered him at all if I hadn’t taken that photograph. Born: Kingsbury, London, 1965Training: “Absolutely zilch.

4/13/2022,"Thomas Tuchel had demanded a “fantastic script” and boy did he get one, another epic and implausible story unfolding. Just not quite as he had hoped; Real Madrid had rewritten the ending, the way they so often seem to do. “The magic of the Bernabéu,” Carlo Ancelotti called it. It would have been barely believable, except that they had seen it somewhere before. The last time they were here, in fact. Go back a month. Crtl C, Ctrl V. Scribble out where it says PSG and write Chelsea instead. Just don’t touch the mentions of Madrid, the club who have made the impossible feel inevitable. It doesn’t matter if it’s absurd, how bad things are – how bad they are – when that final scene comes, there they are: still standing, rubble all round. Just as you imagined, just as they like it. Asked how much they had had suffered, Ancelotti replied: “A lot, a lot.” In the dressing room, Dani Carvajal said: “It’s better this way.” You don’t know how they’ll do it but you know somehow they’ll do it. The Bernabéu knew at least, and that’s part of it, like some self-fulfilling prophecy, each story feeding the next. Casemiro had expressed that the day before: “This club lives to win impossible games, games where no one believes.” Modric called it “another incredible night”, the key word another: he recalled epic evenings against Juventus, PSG, Schalke. Nacho Fernández explained it through Madrid’s DNA. “There are things we have to improve,” the defender admitted, and beyond the emotion there is an analysis, flaws to address, more purely footballing elements to examine in search of their success here, even beyond an excellent first leg in London. The introduction of Eduardo Camavinga for Toni Kroos, for one – vital here, as it was against PSG, Modric noting “the manager did good changes”. The ability of Thibaut Courtois, the most shot-at keeper in the Champions League. Vinícius Júnior and Karim Benzema. That Modric pass: so perfect, so his. “But,” Nacho added, as if it explained everything, “this is Real Madrid.” There are flaws but there is something, a mystic, a magic, a something. A lot of talent too, of course, even if that comes in moments more than full matches. And that part of the story, that idea of something almost spiritual, is more seductive on nights like this, even if it doesn’t explain everything, even if Madrid will lose some days too. Even if others sometimes win in wild ways too. Even if citing fate or fortune or something more fantastical risks being offered up in lieu of an analysis. This is not a sport that always has to make sense and quite often doesn’t. With Madrid, especially. “You can’t explain miracles,” Jorge Valdano said. “The Bernabéu will become a site of pilgrimage.” Marca called it “the biggest madhouse in Europe”, home of the “only team capable of a feat like this”. El País opened its match report on: “This is how Madrid win. Like this, ask no more questions. No one in the footballing universe has the illogical logic Madrid have. A miracle? It’s Madrid, stupid.” In the dressing room, Karim Benzema told the club’s cameraman: “Ask David how you explain this.” David Alaba laughed, no real answer to give. “Madrid,” he replied. “Different.” On the pitch Alex del Piero had embraced Modric, who bade farewell with a face that said: God knows what happened, heading into the tunnel with his tongue hanging out. “Unbelievable,” he called it, only it was also so very believable. By the end Chelsea had taken 29 shots, and had 10 corners to Madrid’s one. Madrid had an improvised, and very small, back four: Lucas Vázquez on the right, Marcelo on the left, Dani Carvajal in the middle. Benzema could hardly move. Modric was playing as a defensive midfielder. Vinícius could not go on. Chances dropped, right to the end: Christian Pulisic twice, Kai Havertz, Jorginho. There was a moment, Modric said afterwards, when Real Madrid were “dead”. But that was when they came alive. When Madrid went 3-0 down, Ancelotti said it “liberated” them; until then he said they had “pulled back on the reins” too much. In the words of El Mundo, it was like they had to “look death in the face” before they reacted. Anything else is too routine. But dead? Those bastards just won’t die, the T-1000 hanging off your back bumper. All they need, all of them, is a glimpse and they grab at it. Then they know. When Chelsea’s third goal was ruled out for a handball, something palpably shifted in the stadium, some collective sense that this was the moment, the first stirrings of a resurrection, time to do it again. Immediately, Benzema headed against the bar. “This is pure Madrid,” said Dani Garrido on the radio station Cadena Ser, laughing at the absurdity of it all, as if everyone saw what was coming. Before the game the huge banner had warned, “Don’t play with the king”, an inevitability about defeat; now he was ready to play, holding all the aces. “How could I not love you?” the Bernabéu started to sing, something awakened in all of them that even Chelsea actually getting the third soon after didn’t stop. A moment after that, Courtois produced a superb save to prevent Chelsea’s fourth, that fantastic script given their ending instead. Within a minute, the outside of Modric’s right boot became the finger on God’s right hand, creator of life. “And then the magic of the Bernabéu appeared, the magic of this club,” Ancelotti said. “It’s hard to explain the magic of the Bernabéu, but it helps the whole team have the energy to reach the semi-final, to never surrender. I am very, very happy to reach the semi-final suffering a lot. The more we suffer, the happier I am.”",Sport/Football,"Mystical, magical, Madrid: Real make the impossible seem inevitable again",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/13/real-madrid-make-impossible-seem-inevitable-again-chelsea
4/13/2022,"Boris Johnson was never going to resign if he didn’t have to. This is all about the Tory party’s view of him now. The party knows as well as you or I that Johnson lied about the lockdown parties. It knows that the lies hit middle Britain, conscientiously obeying the lockdown laws, in the gut. It knows the Tories will take a hit for it in the local elections and eventually the general election too. Yet, remarkably, when it weighs all this up, the Tory party thinks this does not matter all that much. The ostensible reason now being offered is that a prime minister is too important to be dumped during a war. Britain’s own history shows how specious this claim is. Margaret Thatcher was ousted during the build-up to the Gulf war in 1990; Neville Chamberlain during the second world war in 1940; and Herbert Asquith was pushed aside during the first in 1916. Actually, you could argue that a war is a good time to ditch a failing prime minister, not a bad one. And besides, who says we, Britain, are at war? There has been no declaration of war of the kind that Asquith and Chamberlain made. Nobody appears to have told the House of Commons either. Johnson is doing many good things in support of Ukraine and in helping to isolate Russia, but he has not sent a single British soldier, flyer or sailor into harm’s way. There absolutely is a war going on, but a large part of Johnson’s war is a pantomime version performed by a pantomime prime minister. The facts are more prosaic. The party knows that Johnson is mortally wounded. But, since the complacent self-destruction of Rishi Sunak, it isn’t sure who would now win an election that Johnson would lose. How extraordinary it is that, among the 358 other Tory MPs, not one of them thinks they could do better. Instead, the party sits on its hands, making the craven calculation that there is more gravy to be made out of being in government, knowing full well that if a Labour prime minister had done this the indignation on the right would now be at ramming speed. But the Tory party isn’t sitting on its hands about Johnson’s rule breaking alone. It is also complicit in the breaking of the rules – in the sense of the moral code of public life – itself. By saying it is better that Johnson should stay – better for the Tory party, better for the MPs, that is – the party is, in effect, asserting that this prime minister, uniquely, can lie to parliament without consequence, and break the law without paying a political price. That’s not merely shocking, but stupid. There’s sometimes a lot of guff spoken about the marvel of the British unwritten constitution, but spend a moment examining those two claims. First, the lying. Yes, it happens in politics. Ministers are sometimes, as someone once put it, economical with the actualité. “In exceptional circumstances,” the Tory minister William Waldegrave even admitted in the 1990s, “it is necessary to say something that is untrue to the House of Commons.” By this, however, Waldegrave meant something like protecting the value of the pound before a devaluation. There was nothing whatsoever exceptional, not in the smallest degree, about the circumstances in which Johnson told the House of Commons the lie about there being no lockdown parties in Downing Street. No national interest was involved, neither national security nor the pound was threatened. Johnson’s lie was purely self-serving and convenient. Lie, deny and move on is his mantra. All the same, the lie he told was not unimportant. On the contrary. It was a lie about breaking a law that he himself had made, and that the rest of us were dutifully following for the common good. It was not about some victimless infraction like a parking ticket. It was a lie about breaking an emergency regulation to restrict a plague and ultimately save lives. Morally speaking, that is a world away from a parking ticket and only a fool in a hurry would not see the difference. Yet in some ways what is most disturbing, though not most surprising, about the Tory party’s indifference is that it fits such a pattern. You can make a case that previous prime ministers may have also brought politics into disrepute. But has there ever been a leader whose actions and personality have said more clearly to his party that pretty much anything goes as long as we stay in power? Johnson’s disregard for rules and his readiness to cast convention aside are spectacular. But they have become the tip of an iceberg of entitlement that is not just disgraceful, but is threatening public life in Britain more widely. Because it’s not just the PM. MPs now also refuse to resign for things that would once have been terminal to their careers. Their colleagues circle the wagons to defend the miscreants. In the Owen Paterson case, Johnson himself even led the effort to change the rules to let their chum off. Think also of the mateship and insider dealing that polluted the whole contracting process during the pandemic, and the way friends, chums and party donors are now routinely eased, no questions asked, into quango appointments and the House of Lords. We are talking about a system here, not just a person. In her new book, Held in Contempt, Hannah White points out that institutions like parliament need constantly to provide evidence that they are competent, reliable and honest in order to assure the public to have confidence in them. Are we not now witnessing the exact opposite? These supposedly one-off problems like a prime ministerial lie, a bullying minister, a groping male MP, or an insider lobbyist are not isolated events now. As White puts it: “Every reported misdemeanour by an individual MP, every example of MPs acting as if rules do not apply to them, chips away at public respect for the House of Commons in a way that is not easy to repair. Confirmation bias is a powerful force, and the public have been primed to expect the worst.” The Conservative party is now wilfully looking in the wrong direction over Johnson. Remember, there could be more fines yet to come. Sue Gray’s report has yet to be published too. This is not a prime minister who gets the big calls right, not when more than 160,000 British people have died of Covid he isn’t. Millions more are indignant and embarrassed about Johnson’s conduct. He is not up to the job. Our entitled governing party needs to wake up urgently to the reality that Britain deserves better.

4/13/2022,"When news broke that Boris Johnson – along with his chancellor – had been handed a fixed-penalty notice for breaching Covid rules during lockdown, the prime minister’s defenders quickly organised themselves. Tory MPs lined up to publicly offer their support – suggesting that the war in Ukraine had shown there were bigger issues to focus on. That group even included some unlikely cheerleaders such as Roger Gale, a Tory backbencher who had previously called for Johnson to go over the issue. But while more than 70 MPs at the last count have publicly backed Johnson, the concern in No 10 and the whips’ office relates to the 200 or so Tory MPs who are silent at present. While some are trying to make the most of the Easter recess – “colleagues want a break” – the majority are still coming to a decision. “Most MPs are waiting to see whether there are more fines and what the public reaction is,” says a member of the government. “No one thinks there will be 54 letters going in over the next few days.” Even Johnson’s internal critics admit he is in a much better place to fight for his survival than he was two months ago. While the official line from Conservative campaign headquarters to MPs is to say the war in Ukraine means now is not the time to even consider a Tory leadership contest, it’s only one of several factors in MPs’ calculations. The new No 10 team – which is more MP-focused – has been reaching out to the party in recent weeks and has had some success in boosting morale. Meanwhile, the cost of living crisis, rather than parties, has been the issue dominating MPs’ mailboxes in recent weeks. But, perhaps most importantly, Rishi Sunak’s fall from grace means that there is no obvious successor to Johnson and a leadership contest looks less appealing. Even before he was issued with a fine, the chancellor was being written off by MPs as a leadership contender in any immediate contest. Stories about his use of a green card while in No 11 and his wife’s non-dom tax status have served as red flags in the party – suggesting he is politically naive. “He looks like a risky bet now,” says one Tory MP. This is important, because until this point he was viewed as the favourite in any Tory leadership contest. “The most likely contender now is Liz Truss. That’s a problem,” says one member of the 2019 intake who has failed to be caught up in a bout of Truss-mania. There were some nerves in government on Tuesday over the time Sunak took to apologise and confirm that he would stay in place rather than resign. While that decision has helped to stabilise Johnson’s position in the short term, few MPs believe the situation is sustainable. “The fact that Rishi has also got a fine makes the situation worse,” says a senior Tory. “You can’t have the two top members of government having been found to have broken the rules.” But just because no one really wants a leadership crisis doesn’t mean one will be avoided. “Very few MPs want one right now but the party is in a miserable place,” says a member of the government. One group chat made up of One Nation Tories has been pondering if they’ll ever be able to recover the Conservative brand – and the consensus has been negative. Even the most passionate defences of Johnson point to trouble ahead. The prime minister’s supporters have been quick to speak dismissively of the latest batch of fines – questioning the seriousness of the event they relate to, which involved birthday cake in working hours. But here’s the issue: if Sunak is issued with a fine for turning up early to a meeting and briefly attending an event involving cake, what does that mean for the other events that Johnson is alleged to have attended? This includes the infamous “bring your own booze” bash in the Downing Street garden. There’s also the eventual publication of Sue Gray’s report, which is expected to be heavily critical of Johnson. “If he receives more fines,” says a former political colleague of Johnson’s, “he is going to have to explain that he didn’t understand the rules on multiple occasions.” Already Tory MPs are growing nervous that despite the prime minister’s changed circumstances, the situation has not lost its political potency. One MP says they received only a handful of emails from constituents about Sunak’s wife’s non-dom status but since the fines were announced, there have already been hundreds of messages. Combine that with a bad result in the upcoming local elections, and we can expect recriminations to begin. For Tory MPs, the saga is far from over.

4/13/2022,"Conservative MPs have called Boris Johnson’s position “untenable” after the prime minister was fined by the Metropolitan police for breaching lockdown rules, while cabinet ministers have rallied to defend Johnson. Nigel Mills, the MP for Amber Valley, became the latest to call for the prime minister to resign, though several other critics of Johnson have said they will not push for a vote of no confidence because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In a letter to a constituent seen by the Guardian, Mills said: “I don’t think Boris Johnson’s position as prime minister is tenable after breaking the rules his government put in place. Those leading the country must have the highest standards, and therefore, as a result of these fines, I believe his position to be prime minister has become untenable. “I know many of my constituents are rightly angry that at a time when they were observing the very strictest of the rules, some in Downing Street didn’t have the decency to observe them.” Caroline Nokes, the former cabinet minister, confirmed to a constituent that she had already submitted a letter of no confidence in the prime minister. “I have already been very clear that I believe the PM’s conduct fell far short of what my constituents have every right to expect,” she wrote. “I do not need to write a letter of no confidence to the chair of the 1922 Committee, mine was in a very long time ago.” Another Conservative MP, Gary Streeter, who has submitted a letter of no confidence, said his position was “unchanged”. However, many of those who had previously submitted letters of no confidence – Sir Roger Gale, Andrew Bridgen and Douglas Ross – said now was not the time to change leader given the instability caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Overnight, cabinet ministers moved to back Johnson. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said Johnson was “mortified” that he had broken the rules by having a birthday gathering in the cabinet room. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was also given a fixed-penalty notice by police for attending the gathering. Shapps said the prime minister was sorry but went on to minimise the event by saying Johnson had just “walked into a room” where people were gathered to wish him a happy birthday for 10 minutes. Shapps insisted Johnson acted “without malice” and did not “knowingly break laws”. When asked how it had not occurred to the prime minister that he was breaking the rules, Shapps told BBC Breakfast: “I don’t seek to say anything other than it’s deeply disappointing. Of course, it should have done. “I think in answer to your question, specifically, he will have already been in that room with the same people that day chairing crisis meetings on the world’s biggest pandemic for over 100 years. “And he walks in by surprise and into the same room to the people who wished him happy birthday on this occasion. And that’s, of course, the thing which breached the law, and the police have ruled on that and he has paid the fixed-penalty notice of £50 and apologised.” Johnson and Sunak are believed to be the first sitting prime minister and chancellor to have criminal sanctions imposed on them. Both senior politicians were also accused of misleading parliament by previously denying they had attended parties during lockdown. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, called on both the “guilty men”, Johnson and Sunak, to resign for “dishonouring their offices”. He said Johnson had “lied repeatedly to the public” and his behaviour was a “slap in the face” to all those who had followed the rules. “They have to go,” he said. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary and a potential future leadership contender, issued a statement supportive of Johnson, saying he had “apologised and taken responsibility for what happened in Downing Street”. She said: “He and the chancellor are delivering for Britain on many fronts, including on the international security crisis we face. They have my 100% backing.” Some Conservative MPs previously suggested a line would be crossed by allowing a prime minister to remain in office if he was found to have broken the law. About 20 to 30 MPs were at one point thought to have submitted letters of no confidence in Johnson, with 54 needed to trigger a leadership challenge.",News/Politics,Tory MPs say Boris Johnson’s position ‘untenable’ after Partygate fine,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/13/tory-mps-boris-johnson-position-untenable-partygate-fine
4/13/2022,"Facebook remains a thriving marketplace for online wildlife trafficking despite the tech giant’s pledge to help combat the illegal trade, according to a new investigation. Tiger cubs, leopards, ocelots, African grey parrots and the world’s smallest monkey, the pygmy marmoset, were among the endangered animals that researchers from the global campaign group Avaaz found on Facebook pages and public groups. Illegal wildlife trafficking is the world’s fourth largest illicit transnational activity, falling closely behind narcotics, human trafficking and counterfeits. The multibillion-dollar business is linked to a myriad of harms including animal cruelty, endangering species and ecosystems, and fueling the transmission of disease from animals to humans such as coronavirus, Ebola, dengue, anthrax and bird flu. In 2018 Facebook, which has more than 2.9 billion monthly users, co-founded the Coalition to End Wildlife Trafficking Online with experts like WWF, which set out to cut the illegal trade by 80% by 2020. The company says it has made progress but Wednesday’s report suggests Facebook remains a popular platform for animal traffickers. In two days earlier this year, researchers found 129 pieces of potentially harmful content “in a matter of clicks” through the Facebook search bar including posts selling or seeking cheetahs, monkeys, lion cubs and elephant tusks – animals which are listed in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites). This included a Facebook page called “Wildlife Trade, Pangolin Scale & Rhino Horn” calling for bidders on their animals by posting a photo of a pangolin in a cage. “Traffickers do not shy away from listing their goods for sale in public groups, nor from including their phone numbers in their posts,” said Ruth Delbaere, senior legal campaigner at Avaaz. “On Facebook wildlife trafficking takes place in broad daylight.” In the following weeks, Facebook made 95 wildlife-focused recommendations to the researchers through notifications and the “suggested groups” feature. Of these, 76% were posts seeking to buy or sell live animals, which were probably in violation of Facebook’s own policies. The ease with which they were directed to these sites suggests Facebook’s algorithms do not align with its own policies or public commitment to curb the online wildlife trade, the report concludes. “Instead of using the data to help combat wildlife trafficking, their algorithms instead help criminals grow their business,” said Gretchen Peters, executive director of the Alliance to Counter Crime Online. Four Avaaz researchers with no background in investigating the wildlife trade, entered search terms such as “exotic pets”, “monkey for sale” and “pangolin scales” in English, Spanish and Portuguese. They looked for potentially harmful posts, which they defined as content that warrants further investigation to determine whether it constitutes illegal wildlife trafficking activity. According to the report, Facebook appeared to remove 13% of the suspicious wildlife trafficking posts they found before the researchers reported them. After the posts were reported, Facebook had removed only 43% a week after Avaaz alerted the company using its “report post” tool. “Not only does Facebook know that wildlife trafficking is thriving on their platform – they have known about it for years. Yet, they continue to blatantly ignore the problem – or worse – enable it, violating even their own self-professed stand against criminal activity and physical harm to animals. The findings of this investigation are duly noted,” said Raúl Grijalva, Democratic congressman and chair of the House committee on natural resources. In 2018, Grijalva called for an investigation into the social network’s role in illegal wildlife trafficking. In a statement, Facebook’s parent company, Meta, questioned the validity of the study’s methodology and sample size, and said the results did not reflect the work they had done to combat wildlife trafficking. A Meta spokesperson said: “We’ve pioneered technology to help us find and remove this content; launched pop-up alerts to discourage people from participating in this trade. Between January and May 2021 in Indonesia and the Philippines alone, we removed over 1,900 Facebook Groups linked to wildlife trafficking as a result. This is an adversarial space though, and the people behind this awful activity are persistent and constantly evolving their tactics to try and evade these efforts.” The report calls on Facebook to strengthen and enforce policies to end wildlife trafficking including restricting certain search results and changing their algorithms, as well as cooperating with law enforcement and government agencies to combat online wildlife trafficking.",News/Environment,Wildlife trafficking thrives on Facebook despite pledge to fight illegal trade,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/13/wildlife-trafficking-facebook-avaaz-endangered-species
4/13/2022,"More than 1,000 Ukrainian marines defending the besieged port city of Mariupol have surrendered, Moscow has said, as the presidents of four countries bordering Russia head to Kyiv in a show of support for Ukraine. In one of the most critical battles of the war, Russia’s defence ministry said on Wednesday 1,026 soldiers from Ukraine’s 36th Marine Brigade, including 162 officers, had “voluntarily laid down their arms” near the city’s Ilyich iron and steelworks. There was no independent confirmation of the claim. Ukraine’s defence ministry said it had no information about the surrender and the Ukrainian military command said only that Russian forces were attacking the Azovstal industrial area and the port. The Chechen leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, who says his forces are playing a major role in the battle, urged the last Ukrainians holed up in Azovstal to surrender. The 26th Marine Brigade had said on Monday it was preparing for a final battle in Mariupol. The city, the main target yet to be brought under Russian control in the eastern Donbas region, has been encircled and largely reduced to rubble during Moscow’s seven-week invasion. The city’s mayor has said 21,000 civilians have died. Its capture would mark the first fall of a major Ukrainian city and would help Russia secure a land passage between the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk in Donbas and Crimea, which Moscow occupied and annexed in 2014. The Polish and Baltic presidents were headed to the Ukrainian capital by train on Wednesday to show support for the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and his embattled troops in what the Polish presidential adviser Jakub Kumoch called “this decisive moment for the country”. The Polish president, Andrzej Duda, Estonia’s Alar Karis, Gitanas Nausėda of Lithuania and Latvia’s Egils Levits met in the Polish city of Rzeszów near the Ukrainian border. “Heading to Kyiv with a strong message of political support and military assistance,” Nausėda tweeted from the station. The programme of the visit by the leaders of four Nato member states – who fear they may face Russian attacks if Ukraine falls – was not disclosed for security reasons but would focus on ways to assist civilians and the military in Ukraine, as well as with investigations of war crimes, said a spokesperson for the Estonian presidency. It follows Kyiv’s reported refusal to meet the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who visited Poland on Tuesday and said he had planned to go on to Ukraine but “was not wanted”. The former German foreign minister is facing heavy criticism for his past policy of rapprochement towards Moscow. On Wednesday, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said he was “irritated” that Steinmeier had not been received in Kyiv. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, declined on Wednesday to repeat Joe Biden’s accusation that Russia was carrying out “genocide” against Ukrainians, warning that verbal escalations would not help end the war. The US president said on Tuesday it had “become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being able to be a Ukrainian”. Macron said it was important for leaders to be careful with language. “I would say that Russia unilaterally unleashed the most brutal war, that it is now established that war crimes were committed by the Russian army and that it is now necessary to find those responsible and make them face justice,” he said. Zelenskiy told Estonian MPs on Wednesday, without providing evidence, that Russia was using phosphorus bombs in Ukraine. Ukrainian forces in Mariupol said a drone had dropped a poisonous substance on the city, but there has been no independent confirmation that Russia used banned chemical weapons. While Russian troops have largely withdrawn from around Ukraine’s capital in the face of stiff resistance and logistical problems, western officials and analysts say the invasion force is gearing up for a major offensive in the east. Military experts say local support, logistics, the terrain in the region and the appointment by Moscow of a new senior general, Aleksandr Dvornikov, could improve the performance of a force that Britain’s defence ministry said on Wednesday had so far been “hampered by an inability to cohere and coordinate”. The Russian retreat from around Kyiv has led to the discovery of large numbers of apparently massacred civilians, drawing international condemnation and calls for a war crimes investigation. The Kyiv district police chief said on Wednesday that 720 bodies had been found around the capital, with more than 200 missing. Moscow has rejected all allegations of atrocities and Vladimir Putin dismissed the reports as “fakes”. The Russian president said on Tuesday Moscow would “rhythmically and calmly” continue its operation, which the UN says has so far driven more than 10 million Ukrainians from their homes, including more than 4.6 million who have fled abroad.",News/World news,"More than 1,000 Ukraine marines have surrendered in Mariupol, says Russia",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/more-than-1000-ukraine-marines-have-surrendered-in-mariupol-says-russia
4/13/2022,"My mother, with her wartime childhood, refused to set foot on German soil. But in 1975, I was headed to Berlin. At the airport, she took the gold Virgin Mary from her neck and placed it around mine. Till then my life had been enveloped in a “Britain-won-the-war” tale. In time I would become a novelist, and learn to see the novel as a counter-narrative to society’s story. For now, I was picking up material. How did Germany face its wartime heritage? I lodged with an old man on the Nazi War Crimes Register, found a job, took trips beyond the Berlin Wall and into the communist Eastern Zone. Those experiences fuelled my 1992 debut novel On Bended Knees. And began a lifetime’s investigation of how the guilt and traumas of war are passed down to succeeding generations. Back then I found few books by Germans examining their recent heritage: this nation that lost two world wars, industrialised genocide and was split in two after 1945. In 1950 Heinrich Böll tried with his first novel The Silent Angel, set in the immediate postwar ruins of Cologne. His publishers deemed the public not yet ready for such self-examination and it remained unpublished until after Böll’s death. Germany had war trials but no “truth and reconciliation” process, because it exterminated the millions with whom it might have reconciled. Thirty years on, as On Bended Knees is reissued in its anniversary edition, I’ve reviewed the field. It’s grown. Several books on this list take a child’s perspective, with the question “What did my elders know?”. Answers stay hidden. Some elders were complicit in the wartime horrors, others swept west in the tide of refugees fleeing Russian forces. Foreign writers joined the mix, for history provides novelists with no starker terrain to explore. With Britain repositioning itself post-Brexit, and Russia’s war on Ukraine, these novels are as relevant as ever. 1. The One from the Other by Philip Kerr (2006)In 1949, Bernie Gunther re-establishes himself as a private detective in Munich. In true noir mode, a femme fatale sets him on a manhunt – but Bernie’s got some SS history of his own and soon finds that he’s the hunted one. Who’s an ally in this Germany, who’s an enemy - and how do you tell the one from the other? 2. Lost by Hans-Ulrich Treichel (1999)The narrator’s brother was lost as a baby, thrust into a stranger’s arms during a refugee flight from oncoming Russian troops. The narrator knows his own birth was less than a consolation prize. His parents long for their Arnold, who may have been found. Bureaucracy takes hold. The wryness of the put-upon narrator’s voice holds surprises that shocked laughs out of me. 3. Floating in my Mother’s Palm by Ursula Hegi (1990)Born in the last year of the war, Hanna grows up in a small town on the Rhine. At 12 years old she starts a serious exploration of her town through untangling and guessing at the backstories of its inhabitants. War ghosts into this patchwork of lives, but it is memories of the region’s flood and of domestic family dramas that dominate this total charmer. 4. Billiards at Half-Past Nine by Heinrich Böll (1959)As a September day in 1958 rolls toward an 80th birthday party, the story unfolds through the different characters’ reflections. Three generations of architects and folk in their circle look back on the rise and demolition of a 20th-century abbey, on lives lost, on those enticed by Nazi power and those who resisted. A masterful, detailed novel of reconciliation. Worthy in itself of Böll’s Nobel prize. 5. The Reader by Bernhard Schlink (1995)Fifteen-year-old Michael is seduced by Hanna, in her 30s. He succumbs happily. Was he abused? Why does he feel guilt? She disappears, to emerge six years later at a war trial that Michael observes. She was a camp guard culpable in the deaths of hundreds. He resumes a distant relationship when she is in prison, reading books into cassettes for what he now recognises as the illiterate Hanna. Guilt and pleasure entwine generations with their partially examined lives. 6. The Spy Who Came in from the Cold by John le Carré (1963)Alec Leamas is reeled back from running the UK’s spy operations in Berlin, outfoxed by his East German counterpart. “Control”, his UK boss, sets him up to return. In a plot alive with double-crosses, and a city in which all trust is lost, Leamas is wiped of one identity and left to mould a true one. This new model for the espionage novel feels influenced by Albert Camus, examining the absence of meaning in a morally bankrupt world. 7. You Would Have Missed Me by Birgit Vanderbeke (2016)Our narrator is seven. At the age of five her mother snatched her from all she knew of life, in East Germany, and fled west. Home becomes a refugee camp and the girl is happy to find company in its crowds. Her parents’ social climbing means leaving behind the people she loves. Instead she tells stories. Based on the author’s own 1960s childhood. 8. The German House by Annette Hess (2018)In 1960s Frankfurt, Eva is torn. In her late 20s, her fiance wants her to be the model stay-at-home housewife. She is determined to work as translator for Poles in the ongoing trials of Nazis, now upstanding citizens, who are accountable for the horrors of Auschwitz. Newly alert to atrocities that had been hidden, she finds that culpability spreads to all she knows. This novel adroitly blends examination of a family’s and a nation’s past, a romance, and a woman’s quest for self-identity. 9. Visitation by Jenny Erpenbeck (2008)A house on the eastern fringe of Berlin is seen through the tenants and owners who made it their home before fleeing. This includes its Jewish owners and the architect who buys it cut-price when they flee Nazi oppression, who in turn flees the approach of Russian troops. Erpenbeck brings in her own East German heritage in depicting the writer and her family who next move in, tackling the new meaning of property ownership in the communist state. Until even this writer is made to move on. 10. Here in Berlin by Cristina Garcia (2017)The Visitor, akin to the Cuban-American author, spends months of 2013 in Berlin. She brings questions such as “What did war keep offering that ensured its survival?”. Can this 21st-century Germany still be examining its postwar condition? It seems so. She pulls tales from vivid and various survivors in the city. Some are so real they have photos, one is snatched from Günter Grass’s Tin Drum, and all offer up their own versions of honesty.
