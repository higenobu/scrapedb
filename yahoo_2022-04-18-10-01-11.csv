4/18/2022,"When it comes to long-term investing in the oil and gas sector, heavyweights such as ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), BP Plc (NYSE:BP), and Shell (NYSE:SHEL) tend to hog the limelight. However, overlooking mid-cap oil and gas stocks (market-caps between $2 billion and $10 billion) can mean leaving plenty of money on the table. Although these smaller companies tend to receive less analyst coverage as compared to large caps, they offer more growth opportunities than large-cap stocks but exhibit less volatility than their small-cap brethren. Many mid-cap energy stocks have handily outperformed their bigger peers in recent months, with some now garnering Wall Street attention thanks to the energy crisis and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. To wit, last week, Piper Sandler came out with an exceedingly bullish oil note on the oil sector, upping the bank's oil price forecast to $100+ through 2025. Though several banks have called for $100+ oil in 2022, consensus overwhelmingly expects prices to fall back to double digits in the coming years. Oil prices hitting records for a brief moment before falling back below $100 would be less impactful to oil stocks than sustained, triple-digit prices. Piper's view is predicated on long-term impacts to supply from the majors exiting Russia as the bank sees the exodus of talent leading to sustained production declines. The bank further believes US shale will take years to ""make a dent in the supply deficit."" Analyst Mark Lear believes US oil stocks are ""priced for $70 oil."" That is to say, if oil prices fell ~30% and stayed at $70 forever, his stocks would then be fairly valued. Piper Sandler has recommended four mid-and small-cap stocks: Murphy Oil Corp. (NYSE:MUR), Centennial Resource Development, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDEV), Laredo Petroleum (NYSE:LPI), and Berry Corp. (NASDAQ:BRY), raising all from neutral to buy. Murphy Oil and Centennial are true mid-caps with market caps of $6.5B and $2.5B, respectively, while Laredo and  Berry are small-caps with valuations of $1.4B and $977.2M, respectively. All four stocks have posted impressive returns: MUR is up 144.6% over the past 12 months; while CDEV, LPI and BRY have rallied 102.6%, 129.3%, and 40.4%, respectively. Here are the best-performing mid-cap oil and gas stocks during the first quarter. #1. Antero Resources       Market Cap: $10.9B       YTD Returns: 99.0% Denver, Colorado-based Antero Resources Corporation (NYSE:AR)  is an independent oil and natural gas company that acquires, explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, natural gas liquids, and oil properties in the United States. As of December 31, 2021, AR had approximately 502,000 net acres in the Appalachian Basin; and 174,000 net acres in the Upper Devonian Shale. The company also owned and operated 494 miles of gas gathering pipelines in the Appalachian Basin; and 21 compressor stations. The company had estimated proved reserves of 17.7 trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent, including 10.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas; 718 million barrels of assumed recovered ethane; 501 million barrels of primarily propane, isobutane, normal butane, and natural gasoline; and 36 million barrels of oil. Low inventory levels and an improving long-term demand outlook have been driving henry hub gas prices to their highest seasonal level in over a decade. Morgan Stanley sees decelerating natural gas demand in 2023-2024 as LNG terminal capacity growth slows; however, the recent uptick in political support for the industry could improve LNG export demand on a 3-5yr horizon. AR stock has gained 272% over the past 12 months. #2. Range Resources       Market Cap: $8.6B       YTD Returns: 76.4% Range Resources Corporation (NYSE:RRC) operates as an independent natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGLs), and oil company in the United States. The company engages in the exploration, development, and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties. The company was formerly known as Lomak Petroleum, Inc. and changed its name to Range Resources Corporation in 1998. Range Resources Corporation was founded in 1976 and is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas. As of December 31, 2021, RRC owned and operated 1,350 net producing wells and approximately 794,000 net acres under lease located in the Appalachian region of the northeastern United States. Related: Permian Could See Production Surge As New Permits Reach All-Time High RRC actually missed Q4 earnings estimates, though only by a narrow margin. The company guided production effectively flat year on year, on the back of a 14% increase in capex. The dividend remains relatively modest, though the company announced a surprise share repurchase, authorizing a buyback of ~10% of shares outstanding. RRC stock is up 240% over the past 12 months. #3. Vermilion Energy Inc       Market Cap: $3.5B       YTD Returns: 67.9% Calgary, Canada-based Vermilion Energy Inc. (NYSE:VET), together with its subsidiaries, engages in the acquisition, exploration, development, and production of petroleum and natural gas in North America, Europe, and Australia. As of December 31, 2021, the company had 401 net producing conventional natural gas wells and 2,132 net producing light and medium crude oil wells in Canada; 167.6 net producing light and medium crude oil wells in the United States; 297.0 net producing light and medium crude oil wells and 3 net producing conventional natural gas wells in France; and 47 net producing natural gas wells in the Netherlands. It also owns a 20% interest in the offshore Corrib natural gas field located on the northwest coast of Ireland; and a 100% working interest in the Wandoo offshore oil field and related production facilities that covers 59,553 acres situated on Western Australia's northwest shelf. The Wall Street Journal has reported that the Biden administration is seeking ways to increase Canadian oil imports but does not want to resurrect the Keystone XL pipeline. Short-cycle producers could increase production, including Vermilion, Whitecap (OTCPK:SPGYF), and International Petroleum Corp (OTC:IPCFF) are seen as the most likely beneficiaries of the new energy policy goal.

4/18/2022,"An estimated 160 million tax returns are expected to be filed this year, according to the IRS, and so far, the tax season has been running smoothly. The tax agency has processed 6.6% more returns compared with a year ago, though it has received 2.1% fewer returns so far from taxpayers. And according to Ken Corbin, wage and investment division commissioner and chief taxpayer experience officer for the IRS, the tax agency is well on its way to improve taxpayers' experience for the 2023 tax year. “So far we’ve received over 91 million individual returns this year and we’ve processed 89 million returns,” Corbin told Yahoo Finance Live. “What’s great about that is that we’re seeing that more taxpayers are getting our message. We’ve seen about a 96% electronic filing rate, which is outstanding.” The IRS is still grappling with an unprecedented paper backlog of millions of unprocessed returns – some dating back to last year. As of March 31, the tax agency had 2.7 million unprocessed individual tax returns dating back to 2021 and 2.3 million unprocessed returns from the calendar year 2022. Under normal circumstances, the IRS has a backlog of 1 million unprocessed returns entering a filing season. To reduce the chances of further delays, the IRS urged taxpayers to electronically file their returns this year. The agency has also doubled down on measures to hire and reassign workers to get through the pile of unprocessed paper returns. The IRS also redesigned its online website IRS.gov to make it more user-friendly so taxpayers could navigate and find information easily. The tax agency also added a new individual account that allows taxpayers to keep track of their personal information and tax status. “The pandemic has really given us an opportunity to sit back and think about the journeys of the taxpayer as they interact with the IRS,” Corbin said. “It’s an opportunity to be innovative but to also bring cohesion around how we administer the taxes… we’ve introduced new technology like voice and chat bots on our phone as well as IRS.gov. And we’ve implemented taxpayer experience days, where taxpayers can come into our offices and talk with us [on the weekend].” If you have yet to file your tax return this season, and want to avoid any substantial delays with your refund, you should file electronically. National Taxpayer Advocate Erin Collins recently told Yahoo Money that filing a paper return could delay your tax processing for 10 months or longer. This can be a real set back if you’re waiting on a refund or the remaining portion – if not the complete amount — of your Child Tax Credit. “Number one, file electronically and use direct deposit – there are lots of options out there, including our IRS free-file program,” said Corbin. Folks that received an advanced CTC payment last year or collected unemployment were encouraged to use the IRS.gov personal account to check how much they received in aid before filing, so their returns wouldn’t be held for a manual review, said the IRS. The IRS has implemented a variety of programs to help individuals file their taxes as zero cost. “More taxpayers seem to be seeking help in filing their returns, whether they are going to a tax professional or even using our Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program, where we offer free tax prep for taxpayers,” said Corbin. VITA programs are run each year by IRS-certified volunteers to ensure lower-income households can get the tax preparation and services they need to file accurate tax returns and get their refund. VITA resources can also help non-filers claim tax credits they may be eligible for, including the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Child Tax Credit, and any stimulus checks they may not have received. Still, the IRS recognizes that there is still work to be done to avoid the jammed paper backlogs it is currently contending with. “We have to be sensitive to those taxpayers whose returns have not been processed – it’s critical to them,” Corbin said. “There are refunds in those returns and there are other reasons why people need those returns processed either for financial aid for college students or to obtain a loan. What this means for these taxpayers is that their experience has been a challenging one. But at the IRS, we’re all hands on deck. We have a plan so that we can get better than healthy by the time we get to the 2023 season.” Gabriella is a personal finance reporter at Yahoo Money. Follow her on Twitter @__gabriellacruz.

Treasuries dropped on the prospect of rapid Federal Reserve monetary tightening to curb price pressures, pushing the U.S. 10-year yield to about 2.86%. A gauge of the dollar advanced and the yen retreated. Natural gas and oil climbed, partly on risks from Russia’s war in Ukraine. The possibility of a de facto European Union embargo on Russian gas and the threat of some curbs on crude in Europe’s next sanctions package spurred both commodities. U.S. natural gas prices hit a more than 13-year high. China is due to release quarterly growth data and activity indicators for March, which may provide hints about the economic damage from Covid lockdowns. Officials cut the reserve requirement ratio Friday but refrained from lowering interest rates in a cautious approach to policy easing. China’s Covid-linked restrictions are snarling supply chains and stoking global inflation pressures. The latter were already exacerbated by disruptions to commodity flows due to the war and Russia’s isolation. Concern is growing that the U.S. economy faces a downturn from the Fed’s pivot toward aggressive policy tightening to contain the cost of living. “Major regime change is rarely smooth in either geopolitics or economics, and markets are under-pricing these risks,” Eric Robertsen, chief strategist at Standard Chartered Bank Plc, wrote in a note. “We are increasingly concerned about a summer of turbulence and volatility.” In Shanghai, officials published plans to resume production after a prolonged lockdown. Businesses should adopt so-called closed-loop management, where workers live on-site and are tested regularly, they said.

4/18/2022,"Elon Musk has launched an ambitious $43 billion takeover bid for Twitter that he promises would bring big changes to the service. And as part of that plan, the eccentric entrepreneur said he would need to take the publicly-traded company private. In his letter to Twitter announcing the offer, Musk wrote that the social media giant needed to become private “to go through the changes that need to be made.” Twitter has been publicly-traded since November 2013, when it held an initial public offering that raised $1.8 billion. Companies often get big news headlines when they go public, especially when it involves a flashy and lucrative IPO. But companies bought out by an investor that then become private can sometimes go for much larger sums, and it’s not uncommon. Fast-food chain Burger King went public for the first time in 2006, raising $425 million, before being bought four years later by investment firm 3G Capital for $3.3 billion and then taken private. And in 2007, publicly listed real-estate investment company EQ Office was acquired by investment management company Blackstone for $39 billion and taken private. Companies that go private are no longer listed or traded on a public stock exchange. Going private also means that they no longer need to report financial information to the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) or follow many of its rules. Going private often entails a few important benefits for the company. It removes the pressure to file quarterly financial reports, giving executives more freedom to pursue riskier and longer-term projects without being concerned about public shareholders demanding quick results. Companies often go private after being bought by private equity firms or other investment groups, making Elon Musk’s takeover bid as an individual somewhat of an outlier. But for Musk, the point seems to be having at least most of the control. In his letter to Twitter, Musk emphasized that he sees “extraordinary potential” in Twitter as a “platform for free speech around the globe.” But he added that the social media platform’s current management is unable to unlock that potential. It isn’t the first time Musk has railed against Twitter for repressing free speech, which he partly blames on the platform’s reliance on ad revenues. But the changes he has in mind may not make for immediate profits. Musk has said he would tweak the service’s policing of content, which has included censoring or banning certain users for spouting hate speech or inciting violence, including former President Trump. He also said he prefers temporary “timeouts” to permanently banning users. Another benefit of taking Twitter private would be that it would no longer need to report its quarterly financials to the SEC, an agency the billionaire recently referred to as “bastards.” In 2018, Musk settled the SEC accusations that he had falsely said claimed to have had enough money secured to take electric car company Tesla private. As part of that settlement, he stepped down as Tesla's chairman and paid a fine.

The Fed chair will speak at an event on Thursday and later that day later take part in a panel hosted by the International Monetary Fund, along with European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and other policy makers. Blackout starts midnight Friday. Powell has already said that a 50 basis-point increase is possible at the Fed’s May 3-4 meeting. Comments by colleagues since then have hardened expectations they’ll make that move, as officials extend a hawkish pivot to curb the hottest inflation since 1981. Minutes of their March meeting showed many favored raising rates by a half point and only opted for the more cautious 25 basis point move because of the uncertainty around Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The account showed officials expect to start shrinking their balance sheet by $95 billion a month, or more than $1 trillion a year, and could announce a decision in May. Governor Lael Brainard said April 12 that could mean roll-off as soon as June. Brainard also said that pricing in financial markets shows investors have gotten the message that officials will move “expeditiously” to lift rates to neutral, or the level that neither speeds up nor slows down the economy. Interest-rate futures imply at least another 200 basis points in tightening of the Fed’s main policy rate from its current 0.25% to 0.5% target range. Officials estimate neutral to lie at about 2.4%.

4/18/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. shareholders suing over Elon Musk’s 2018 tweet about taking the company private said they won a key ruling in the run-up to a fraud trial with billions of dollars in damages at stake. Most Read from Bloomberg Housing Market Fever Starts to Break in Boise Ukraine Update: Mariupol ‘Basically Encircled’ Yet Hasn’t Fallen Biden Weighing Student Loan Cancellation or Moratorium Extension Musk Uses Inverted Smile Emoji on 2017 Tweet About Twitter Price Ukraine Update: Zelenskiy Says Talks With Russia Are at Dead End The investors said a federal judge agreed with them that “no reasonable jury could find Musk’s tweets on August 7, 2018 accurate or not misleading,” according to a court filing late Friday. The filing describes an April 1 order by the judge that isn’t listed on the docket. Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Musk and Tesla, said “nothing will ever change the truth, which is that Elon Musk was considering taking Tesla private and could have.” “All that’s left some half decade later is random plaintiffs’ lawyers trying to make a buck and others trying to block that truth from coming to light all to the detriment of free speech,” he said Saturday. The ruling -- if not appealed -- will put the electric-car maker at a big disadvantage in a San Francisco jury trial set for late May because Tesla won’t be allowed to argue the controversial Twitter post was truthful. It will allow investors to focus mainly on connecting Musk’s statement to their stock market losses. The decision is also a blow to the credibility of the world’s richest person as he continues to wage legal battles that other chief executives would avoid or settle. Adding to the spectacle, Musk is making a hostile bid to take control of Twitter Inc. on a pledge to make the platform a bastion of free speech. Musk told a New York federal judge in early March he “would never lie to shareholders.” He’s asking that judge to free him from social media restrictions he agreed to after the Securities & Exchange Commission sued him for fraud over the 2018 tweets. In San Francisco, the shareholders suing over securities fraud are urging U.S. District Judge Edward M. Chen to prohibit Musk from making any more public comments about his “interpretation and opinions” of the claims in their lawsuit until after the trial is finished. Read More: Musk’s Venting About SEC Ires Investors Suing Over 2018 Tweets The investors took specific aim at comments Musk made during a TED event this week in Vancouver. He said “I was forced to concede to the SEC unlawfully” and settle the agency’s lawsuit over the 2018 “funding secured” tweet. Shareholders argue that Musk’s “indisputably false” August 2018 tweet and follow-up posts on Twitter cost them billions of dollars amid wild swings in Tesla’s stock price, while Musk’s lawyers countered that the post to his millions of followers was “entirely truthful.” To fend off allegations that the missive was fraudulent, Musk’s lawyers have stood by their argument that Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund had agreed to support his attempt to take Tesla private. What Bloomberg Intelligence Says Theoretical damages could be as high as $12 billion, but we think settlement value may be $260-$380 million. -- Holly Froum, Litigation Analyst For a full report click here Lawyers for the shareholders said Chen was “explicit and unambiguous” in siding with them in the judge’s April 1 order finding the August 2018 tweet to be false. The judge concluded Musk “recklessly made the statements with knowledge as to their falsity,” the lawyers said in the Friday filing. Nicholas Porritt, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said the judge’s order wasn’t issued publicly and was shared with the parties on April 12. “Because it refers to evidence that defendants regarded as confidential, the court preliminarily filed the order under seal while the parties agree what portions, if any, need to stay under seal,” Porritt said in an email. Court officials couldn’t immediately be reached to confirm the judge’s order. The case is In re Tesla Inc.

4/18/2022,"Don't miss CoinDesk's Consensus 2022, the must-attend crypto & blockchain festival experience of the year in Austin, TX this June 9-12. Google (or DDG) “inflation” and you’ll find articles with headlines from basically every media outlet saying something like: “US Inflation Jumps to Fresh 4-Decade High of 8.5% in March.” That’s a big number. When inflation fear enters the conversation, investors go “risk-off,” and they pile into inflation hedges and store-of-value assets like gold and … like bitcoin? Well then, why didn’t bitcoin’s price rocket up after the inflation print came out last week? Is bitcoin a bad inflation hedge? Is it ever going to be a store of value? For all its promise, Bitcoin’s sound money properties should predispose it toward being a useful inflation hedge and store of value. That has fallen flat. So what gives? How aspirational is the “bitcoin as a store-of-value” narrative? Are bitcoin investors screwed? Why is bitcoin acting like a tech stock? That (and maybe more) below… – George Kaloudis You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday. Prevailing economic theory is built upon three pillars: output, money and expectations. The people and groups that run economies want to increase economic output and strengthen their sovereign money against other currencies while managing expectations for the future to avoid economic downturns. There’s not enough room in a column to dive into the gory details of all of these concepts, but let’s zoom in on money, expectations and the entity responsible for those two in the U.S., the Federal Reserve, and tie it into recent inflation woes (and Bitcoin!). The Fed has been given responsibility for monetary policy in the U.S. and aims to ensure “maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates.” The Fed has three levers it can pull to achieve its goal: 1) open market operations (i.e. “print money”), 2) the discount rate (i.e. “interest rates”) and 3) reserve requirements (i.e. “vault deposit rules”). Printing money (by buying bonds and “stuff”) and changing interest rates (by changing the rate it charges banks to lend money overnight) are the main mechanisms we’ve seen the Fed employ in recent memory. And, wow, does the Fed have its hands full right now. “Stable prices'' is a goal for the Fed, and that has historically meant an arbitrary 2% target for inflation each year, meaning the Fed wants things to cost 2% more each year. Well, last week the consumer price index, a means to measure inflation, jumped to a four-decade high of 8.5% year-over-year in March. Basically, last year’s $10 burrito is now $10.85. That is not a good thing. On top of that, year-over-year CPI metrics have exceeded 2% every month since March 2021. Inflation is clearly not transitory. I’m not going to talk about how unprecedented money printing and near-zero interest rates might have led us here. Instead, I’m going to talk about what investors are doing to protect their portfolios. In times of high inflation and economic uncertainty, investors go risk-off, and there’s a “flight to quality.” In practice, when sentiment flips risk-off, investors sell their risky tech stocks and buy something like bonds, or if they really fear inflation, something sound like gold. And you know what’s better than gold? Gold 2.0 of course. Bitcoin (or the Reserve Asset 3.0). We have high inflation, and so everyone piled into bitcoin and its price shot up, right? Not quite…  What gives? This is sound money, right? This is a store of value with a known current supply and emissions schedule, right? Isn’t bitcoin provably scarce? I thought the emissions schedule of bitcoin didn’t change as demand for the asset increased? That’s all true: Bitcoin has a known monetary policy with a hard cap and a predetermined minting schedule; anyone with a full node (a basic computer with some software) can tell you how many bitcoins are in circulation and if the price of bitcoin went to $1 million tomorrow, the coins wouldn’t be mined any faster than they are today. But there’s one thing missing. Narrative. On a 60-day lookback, bitcoin’s price has been somewhat correlated (> 0.20 correlation coefficient) with the technology stocks in the Nasdaq for about 50% of trading days in 2022. I think the reason for that is quite simple. While bitcoin’s hard money properties make it a risk-off asset for its supporters, investors see a risk-on asset because of its volatility and technology-like asymmetric price upside. When investors want to cut risk, they sell stocks alongside bitcoin. So bitcoin isn’t a risk-off or risk-on asset yet. Instead, I think it’s better to call it “risk everything.” As such, it is probably more accurate to refer to bitcoin as an aspirational store of value. Yes, a borderless, permissionless, uncensorable, sound monetary system-of-value transfer with a predictable monetary policy is theoretically a great store of value, but until that narrative penetrates more than 100 million people, the other 7.8 billion people won’t view that system as a store of value, and that narrative will prevail.

4/18/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- A funny thing happened to Bitcoin as interest rates started to rise: trading volumes went way down. Now market-watchers are grappling with the implications and what a world of less-loose monetary policy means for digital assets. Most Read from Bloomberg Housing Market Fever Starts to Break in Boise Ukraine Update: Mariupol ‘Basically Encircled’ Yet Hasn’t Fallen Biden Weighing Student Loan Cancellation or Moratorium Extension Musk Uses Inverted Smile Emoji on 2017 Tweet About Twitter Price Ukraine Update: Zelenskiy Says Talks With Russia Are at Dead End The aggregate 30-day moving-average volume for Bitcoin across Coinbase, Bitfinex, Kraken and Bitstamp is at its lowest level since August 2021, according to data compiled by Strahinja Savic at FRNT Financial. Over the last month, the aggregate daily volume on those venues has averaged just over $1 billion. That reading stood at $2.57 billion in May 2021, a nearly 60% decline. That’s happened as the Federal Reserve and other central banks accelerate their fight against inflation, which has remained hotter for longer than many had expected it would. With rates rising and the cost of money no longer hovering around zero, crypto prices have flagged, prompting investors to recalculate their desires to be invested in the cutting-edge market. For one, the withdrawal of liquidity impacts volumes in crypto -- and elsewhere -- by reducing the funds available to invest, says Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at Genesis Global Trading. Second, higher rates increase the opportunity cost of investing in non-yielding assets such as Bitcoin. And those buying the coin using leverage could feel an extra pinch: higher borrowing costs alter the risk-reward scenario of such trades, meaning that your potential return drops as your costs go up. “Volumes are down because of the uncertainty,” she said. “Investors seem to be worried that things could get worse before they get better.” Acheson notes that the percentage of Bitcoin that has not moved for over a year is at an all-time high, with roughly 76% of the coin held in addresses considered illiquid, meaning they exhibit little movement. While that could show conviction in the idea Bitcoin could be used as a store of wealth in an environment of “intensifying macroeconomic uncertainty and unrest,” for now, “price movements are determined by the risk preferences of macro investors who are concerned about the global rates and economic outlook.” Data from Glassnode suggests that interest in Bitcoin has remained muted -- on-chain measures indicate little growth in the coin’s user-base and minimal flows of new demand. Plus, Bitcoin has been stuck in a tight trading range as it’s largely dominated by HODLers, a term that refers to investors who’ve got the gumption to stick around during major bouts of volatility. Strategists at the research firm say “it is hard to find many observations that suggest the network user-base is recovering or growing strongly.” They cite the number of active entities, something akin to daily active users -- that measure is stuck in the same bear-market channel it’s been mired in for six years. David Shafrir, CEO of SDM, an institutional OTC trading desk, says he’s seeing new clients coming in but that average volumes from pre-existing clients have dropped anywhere from 8% to 15%. A slowdown in consumer power is one factor behind that, as is uncertainty around the Fed’s reaction to persistently high inflation. That’s “caused some significant insecurity within the entire market as a whole,” Shafrir said by phone. “Now we’re starting to see the effects of that.” As is the case with other asset classes, Bitcoin needs new backers for prices to stabilize. The emergence of new crypto fans -- institutional as well as retail -- over the past two years coincided with a skyrocketing in prices. Bitcoin rose more than 300% in 2020 and another 60% in 2021. That desire to be in on the asset class may have changed -- so far this year, it’s lost more than 10% amid a similar slump in other riskier assets, with analysts saying it will take a whole new catalyst to jolt prices higher once again. “We’re not getting follow-through from new investors. Despite the relentless advertising, most of those who were inclined to buy Bitcoin have already done so,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers LLC. Ultimately, Bitcoin is a risk asset and will behave the way other risk assets do, he said. An oft-cited measure is that of Bitcoin’s correlation to other areas of the traditional market that might be hurt in a rising-rate environment. The 90-day correlation coefficient of the coin and a basket of non-profitable tech stocks now stands above 0.60, the highest such reading on record. (A coefficient of 1 means the assets are moving in lockstep, while minus-1 would show they’re moving in opposite directions.) Meanwhile, Bank of America’s Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss in an April 12 note said that Bitcoin exchange outflows in the prior week totaled $1.2 billion and were the largest of the year. The week prior to that one saw investors pulling out $532 million. Overall, exchange outflows in recent weeks were many times larger than average outflows seen during weeks at the start of February and the beginning of March. The strategists say the trends “indicate that investors are HODLing.” Still, Russell Starr, CEO and executive chairman of DeFi Technologies, says Bitcoin is more an inflation hedge than a risk asset. Inflation is likely worse than current readings are reflecting, he says, citing a common refrain in the crypto community. The U.S. could fall into a recession and that would spur the Fed to loosen monetary policy again, he said. “Yes, you may see some near-term weakness,” he said by phone. But ultimately, Bitcoin, under this scenario, will “test $60,000, $70,000, $80,000, $100,000.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek America’s Favorite Truck Is About to Test Tesla’s Dominance Beijing Crackdown Derails Alibaba’s Bid for Amazon-Size Profit How Two Ex-Cops Cracked a $100 Million Maritime Mystery How Jack Dorsey Quit Twitter to Become Bitcoin’s Spiritual Leader Looking for a Brand Name That Will Stand Out?

4/18/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- A growing list of risks is turning China into a potential quagmire for global investors. Most Read from Bloomberg Housing Market Fever Starts to Break in Boise Ukraine Update: Mariupol ‘Basically Encircled’ Yet Hasn’t Fallen Biden Weighing Student Loan Cancellation or Moratorium Extension Musk Uses Inverted Smile Emoji on 2017 Tweet About Twitter Price Ukraine Update: Zelenskiy Says Talks With Russia Are at Dead End The central question is what could happen in a country willing to go to great lengths to achieve its leader’s goals. President Xi Jinping’s friendship with Russian leader Vladimir Putin has made investors more distrustful of China, while a strongman narrative is gaining momentum as the Communist Party doggedly pursues a Covid-Zero strategy and unpredictable campaigns to regulate entire industries. As a result, some international investors are finding an aggressive allocation to China increasingly unpalatable. Outflows from the country’s stocks, bonds and mutual funds accelerated after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, while Norway’s $1.3 trillion sovereign wealth fund has snubbed a Chinese sportswear giant due to concerns about human-rights abuses. U.S. dollar private-equity funds that invest in China raised just $1.4 billion in the first quarter -- the lowest figure since 2018 for the same period. The scale and speed of sanctions imposed on Russia forced a rethink of Western attitudes to China, according to Simon Edelsten of U.K. investment firm Artemis Investment Management LLP. His team at the $37 billion money manager sold all its China investments last year following Beijing’s interventions in high-profile listings like Didi Global Inc. and Ant Group Co., saying such moves threatened shareholder rights. China’s more assertive rhetoric around Hong Kong and sovereignty claims in the South China Sea also made the investment team uneasy, Edelsten said. “Politics and governance factors should now set a cautious tone, especially for long-term commitments” to China, said Edelsten, adding that European measures taken against Russia show that strong trade ties are no guarantee of diplomatic security. “The Ukraine invasion raises these risks very sharply and our funds are likely to remain very lowly weighted in China for some years to come,” he added. Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer at Krane Funds Advisors LLC, describes “indiscriminate and price-insensitive selling” of Chinese shares by international investors in the past year. Beijing’s regulatory actions “felt like an attack on the most respected and widely foreign-held companies,” he said, while sanctions on Russia raised concern the same could happen to China. His firm -- which manages China-focused exchange-traded funds -- is replacing U.S.-listed Chinese stocks with those trading in Hong Kong to reduce risk. Making money in China’s public markets has become more difficult. The CSI 300 Index of stocks is down about 15% year-to-date and its risk-adjusted return -- as measured by the Sharpe ratio -- is among the lowest globally, at minus 2.1. That’s only slightly better than Sri Lanka’s Colombo All-Share Index. The Chinese index is trading near the lowest level since 2014 relative to MSCI Inc.’s global stock gauge. For the first time since 2010, Chinese benchmark sovereign 10-year notes offer no carry over comparable U.S. Treasuries. And returns in China’s high-yield dollar credit market were the worst in at least a decade last quarter. Global funds have started to pull out, selling more than $7 billion worth of mainland-listed stocks via exchange links with Hong Kong in March. They also disposed of $14 billion in Chinese government debt over the past two months and trimmed their credit holdings. Betting against China was considered the fifth most-crowded trade in Bank of America Corp.’s most recent survey of investors. “Markets are worried about China’s ties to Russia -- it’s scaring investors and you can see that risk aversion playing out since the start of the invasion,” said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management. “Everyone was selling China bonds so we’re glad we didn’t buy any.” Still, divesting from China may not be a straightforward choice. The world’s second-largest economy possesses a $21 trillion bond market and equity bourses valued at $16.4 trillion onshore and in Hong Kong. Its assets offer diversification for investors, Amundi Singapore Ltd.’s head of investment Joevin Teo said last week, with multi-asset strategies struggling under the threat of inflation and tightening global financial conditions. Some have even called Chinese assets a haven. “It’s one of the best diversification stories for global funds because of its idiosyncratic nature,” said Lin Jing Leong, senior emerging market Asia sovereign analyst at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, which manages about $754 billion. “Who owns the market, the cycle of China’s growth and inflationary pressures, the low volatility in its currency basket” all help to provide better risk-adjusted returns, she added. Chinese authorities appear to be taking steps to appeal to global funds. Regulators last month promised to ensure policies are more transparent and predictable -- key sticking points for investors who lost trillions of dollars in 2021 due to Beijing’s crackdown on tech and tutoring firms. China is also making compromises that may grant American regulators partial access to audits of U.S.-listed Chinese companies. While Wall Street giants such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are rushing to take full ownership of their China ventures, some companies are divesting. In March, Germany’s Fraport AG sold its stake in Xi’an Airport to a local buyer, ending a 14-year stint in China. The airport operator said it decided to exit the Chinese market after struggling to expand its business. Fraport also owns a share of St. Petersburg airport in Russia, which it’s currently unable to sell. Others are preparing for China’s decoupling from the West. Self-driving technology startup TuSimple Inc. is considering spinning its China operations off into a separate entity, following American authorities’ concerns over Beijing’s access to its data. Oil giant Cnooc Ltd. may exit operations in the U.K., Canada and the U.S. due to concerns the assets could be subject to sanctions, Reuters reported last week. Investment professionals at one American private equity fund in Hong Kong aren’t pursuing opportunities in China as aggressively as before even though prices are far lower, according to a person who asked not to be named discussing internal strategies. Concerns include the difficulty of exiting investments and problems that may arise from a hardening of positions such as U.S. investment bans or a consumer boycott of made-in-China products. As risks increase and rewards diminish, adding exposure to China may no longer be a no-brainer for global investors. In a speech last week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called Beijing to account for its ever-closer relationship with Moscow. “The world’s attitude towards China and its willingness to embrace further economic integration may well be affected by China’s reaction to our call for resolute action on Russia,” she said.

4/18/2022,"With President Joe Biden proposing to force billionaires to shoulder higher income tax burdens, more states have been employing a handy old idea to head in the opposite direction. They have embraced the flat tax or flat-rate tax as a single-tier system is known. It is hailed by many GOP governors and legislatures as a way to promote what they perceive as greater fairness for all taxpayers and to attract business to their states. At the same time, the flat tax hasn’t lost any of its controversy. The system still prompts an outcry from critics who deride it as a regressive scheme that flies in the face of trying to narrow the income gap. Enthusiasm for the flat tax built on the American political scene when it became the centerpiece of publishing magnate Steve Forbes’ unsuccessful runs for the Republican presidential nomination in 1996 and 2000. Besides saying the tax would be fairer to all, Forbes vowed that the flat tax would make filing returns to the IRS as simple as mailing in a postcard. Yet the states that have enacted flat tax rates cross the political divide. They include Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Utah. Georgia just joined the movement with its legislature voting for a flat income tax rate of 4.99% by 2029, even though it will cut revenue by $1 billion. Currently, the top rate is 5.75%. ►2022 IRS tax return deadline: What to know about extensions, refunds and child tax credits. Supporters in states contemplating a move to flat tax rates picture flat taxes as a way to help them grow, attracting businesses and the affluent who will spend money and support the economy. Flat tax rates alone aren’t enough for some Republican-led states. They’re employed in conjunction with rate cuts. Iowa’s Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a bill last month that creates a flat tax rate of 3.9% by 2026. She said the individual income tax rate was 8.98% when she took office, after being elected in 2018. A $1.1 billion tax cut voted in by the Indiana legislature in March would tie the state for having the lowest flat tax rate on income in the country when fully implemented. It would be 2.9%. But flat tax rates are holding their own even in states that tend to vote Democratic. Illinois voters, for instance, rejected a 2020 ballot measure to jettison the flat tax in Illinois in favor of a six-tier arrangement. ►Tax season 2022: When are tax returns due? These are the deadlines to file The concept of a single rate would sound appealing to Americans hunched over stacks of tax forms this month ahead of the April 18 federal income-tax filing deadline. Yet the flat tax is not really about making tax filing less complex. “It has nothing to do with reforming taxes and everything to do with cutting taxes,” said Richard Auxier,senior policy associate for the Urban Brookings Tax Policy Center. He contends that much of the tax cutting is already aimed at wealthier households, not those who need it most. For Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, the flat tax holds a special allure. Because it’s uniform, it prevents governors or legislators from trying to soak the rich or any other group. It requires that if income taxes need to be raised, they'll be raised on everyone. Raising taxes on the wealthy – the theory being most people are fine with tax hikes when they aren’t the ones being hit with the increase – is easier than trying to mobilize the electorate for a broad tax increase. “It treats everyone the same,” Norquist said of the flat tax. As the head of an organization known for eliciting commitments from officeholders to oppose all tax increases, Norquist said the flat tax is a handy tool for states that are trying to gradually reduce their tax rates with an eye toward abolishing them entirely. If it were to occur, they would join Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington and Wyoming as states that have no personal income tax. In contrast to states collapsing their tax tiers, Biden advocates for a different approach when it comes to the mega-rich. In his budget blueprint that he sent to Congress, Biden singled out billionaires as not paying enough in federal income taxes. Billionaires pay an average of 8% in income taxes, which is about half of what average workers like teachers or firefighters pay, Biden said. The Economic Policy Institute found that the top 1% of richest Americans take home about 21% of all income. Rather than announcing a new top tax bracket for the richest Americans, Biden called on them to have to pay a minimum of 20% of their income in taxes every year. “If you make a billion bucks, great. Just pay your fair share,” Biden added in announcing his proposal. Tax season 2022: When are tax returns due?

4/18/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk kept investors in the dark this weekend, floating a cryptic tweet with the word “tender,” a likely wink-and-nod reference to a potential tender offer to Twitter Inc. shareholders for control of the company. Most Read from Bloomberg Housing Market Fever Starts to Break in Boise Ukraine Update: Mariupol ‘Basically Encircled’ Yet Hasn’t Fallen Biden Weighing Student Loan Cancellation or Moratorium Extension Musk Uses Inverted Smile Emoji on 2017 Tweet About Twitter Price Ukraine Update: Zelenskiy Says Talks With Russia Are at Dead End The world’s richest person caused a stir last week after he filed a $43 billion proposal offering $54.20 a share for the social network, which led Twitter to adopt a so-called poison-pill provision on Friday to make it harder for Musk or a group of investors to acquire more shares. If Twitter directors ultimately reject him, the world could learn whether Musk was truly threatening a direct appeal to shareholders or had just added the 1956 Elvis Presley hit “Love Me Tender” to his playlist. Musk may try to partner with investors including Oracle Corp., given that its chief executive officer, Larry Ellison, is on Tesla Inc.’s board, along with a group of private equity firms including Thoma Bravo, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Mandeep Singh and Ashley Kim wrote Friday. That partnership could raise the bid to $50 billion, they wrote. An acquisition is far from certain even without the poison-pill provision and defensive tactics from the company’s board. Musk said at an April 14 TED conference that he is “unsure” if he’ll actually be able to acquire the company, adding that he has a back-up plan, without offering details. Over the weekend, Musk said the economic interests of Twitter’s board are not aligned with shareholders. He was responding to a tweet about board members’ stock holdings, saying that with the departure of Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, the board “collectively owns almost no shares.” Dorsey, who remains on the company’s board until later this year, also took the unusual step of criticizing its managers on the platform. “It’s consistently been the dysfunction of the company,” Dorsey wrote of Twitter’s board. With all eyes on the battle for Twitter, Wall Street banks are taking sides. Twitter has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., the latter of which has sparred previously with Musk over the valuation of hundreds of millions of dollars in Tesla stock warrants. Morgan Stanley is advising Musk. Twitter shares have risen about 15% since Musk disclosed a 9.2% stake in the company on April 4 but, at $45.08 as of April 14, are well shy of his offer price, reflecting doubts that a deal will go through. Tesla has dropped 9.2% in the same period, as its investors grapple with the prospect of its CEO being distracted with another public company or passion project. The electric-vehicle maker is also under pressure in China, where its massive Shanghai automobile factory has been shuttered for weeks by the region’s Covid-19 lockdowns. Later this week, Tesla will report first-quarter earnings after posting record deliveries in the first three months of the year. Analysts are estimating revenue of about $17.8 billion and adjusted earnings of $2.27 a share. “Tesla’s next phase of growth depends primarily on eliminating capacity constraints in Europe as the Berlin factory begins deliveries,” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Kevin Tynan and Andreas Krohn wrote last week. “The pace of adoption and subsequent competition -- given a more intense government regulatory and subsidy environment -- ratchets up the urgency of getting high-volume nameplates built overseas.” (Updates with Musk’s comment about Twitter’s board in sixth paragraph.

4/18/2022,"Soaring inflation, Russia’s war on Ukraine, sanctions, uncertainty over global economic contraction and a pandemic that still hasn’t disappeared have investors playing a dubious guessing game as to what sector is going to come out on top. That volatility and uncertainty now seems to be leading money into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as one of the key hedges. No one’s been scared away. Instead, they're just shifting. And big money is still pouring into stocks: Source: FXEmpire.com That said, the first quarter did see plenty of losses, with the S&P 500 shedding nearly 5%, the Nasdaq 100 declining 9% and the Russell 2000 down 7%. ETFs performed well throughout, in specific categories. Energy, of course, won the quarter, but even that is still a guessing game going forward, with a complete lack of consensus as to where it’s headed. The market can’t get a handle on the full impact of the Russian war on Ukraine and the sanctions that have been put in place. Out of the 30 top performing ETFs for Q1 2022, 26 of them were from the energy sector. Source: TheStreet.com For Q2, investors are having a bit of a rethink, and the top performing ETFs might not be dominated by energy–at least so thoroughly. One ETF segment that we expect to emerge as a major winner is in the area of semiconductor chips, where long-running shortages have been wreaking havoc in the auto industry, where inventories are extremely low and prices are soaring. This is a bet, according to Bloomberg, on the semiconductor industry recovering from its supply chain problems. Shortages haven’t meant huge riches for the semiconductor sector because that only works when you can actually race to meet soaring demand. The money is made in the balance. Investors are now seriously hedging on brighter days ahead, pouring some $6.8 billion into chipmaker ETFs in Q1 2022. They didn’t put that much into it for the entire year of 2021, according to Bloomberg. Try VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) on the dip. It’s lost over 21% YTD, but if big money is right, the rebound could be rewarding.
 Another shift we could see on the ETF arena is towards “inflation-fighting” funds. With inflation pushing prices to 40-year high levels, this could be a good way to hedge against rising costs. The Horizon Kinetics Inflation Beneficiaries ETF (INFL) intends to do exactly this. The goal of this ETF is to basket a bunch of very carefully curated stocks that are more likely to outperform their peers when costs of energy and raw materials rise in an inflationary environment. It’s a fund you might not have heard of, but it’s plenty liquid. Year-to-date, it’s up over 9% but Q2 is when we expect the inflationary pressures to really kick in, so this could have considerable room to run further. It’s time for a rethink of investment portfolios, and going all-in on energy isn’t protection enough. ""Markets got more complicated,"" Nanette Abuhoff Jacobson, global investment strategist at Hartford Funds, told Investors.com. ""2021 was really marked by a single theme and response, which was Covid and what the policy response would be. So, while it didn't feel like things were relatively simple, in hindsight it was. And that's why risk assets did spectacularly well. Now, we've got multiple narratives that are rocking markets and volatility is much higher.""

4/18/2022,"Have you paid your taxes yet? It may seem like a silly question to ask on April 16, but of course the deadline this year is Monday, April 18, (except in Massachusetts and Maine, where Monday is Patriot’s Day, so some New Englanders actually have until Tuesday EOD.) If you do owe money of course you can send in a paper check. Or, you can file electronically. Increasingly Americans are doing that, roughly some 153 million out of 163 million individual returns this year, and have the IRS debit your account. Or, (and I didn’t know this), you can pay cash at a participating retailer, as they say, such as Dollar General, Family Dollar, CVS Pharmacy, Walgreens, Pilot Travel Centers, 7-Eleven, Speedway, Kum & Go, Royal Farms, Go Mart, Kwik Trip. The IRS has an instruction page here on how to pay cash, which looks pretty straightforward. I wondered if there was a fee for using this service and yes, by golly there is, a modest one, but a fee nonetheless of $1.50. The IRS page notes the payment goes to a company called VanillaDirect, whose website says: ‘Sign up for the easy way to pay bills by cash*’ (*‘Service fee applies.’) The site further explains that VanillaDirect allows customers to pay utility bills, insurance companies and long distance companies — and the IRS — with cash using its payment system. Who owns or runs VanillaDirect? I didn’t see an ‘about us’ on the site, but at the bottom in small type a notice reads: “VanillaDirect is provided by InComm Financial Services California, Inc. and by InComm Financial Services, Inc….” Parent company InComm Payments describes itself as “a pioneer in point-of-sale (POS) technology."" InComm holds a key patent that protects a computer-implemented method for activating, deactivating, and redeeming prepaid cards at POS terminals. Also, “the company pioneered the concept of prepaid, gift, and store value products such as wireless refill cards and iTunes cards. It also helps 'connect major retailers with product providers across the retail industry.'” Now that we know a little bit about the company that collects the nominal $1.50 fee from tax filers who choose to go to one of the aforementioned retailers to pay Uncle Sam, how many people actually pay taxes with cash? InComm Payments told Yahoo Finance that it has processed only 319 payments to the IRS’ payment solutions provider since launching the service in January 2021. Apparently not a lot of Americans.

4/18/2022,"Didi Global, the Chinese ride-hailing giant being investigated by Beijing for cybersecurity breaches, said it will hold a special shareholder meeting on May 23 to vote on its ""voluntary"" delisting in the United States. The Beijing-based firm, which was put under investigation days after its US$4.4 billion initial public offering (IPO) on June 30 last year, said in a statement on Saturday that it will not apply for another listing on any other exchange before completing its delisting from the New York Stock Exchange. In a statement issued in December, it had said that it would delist from New York and pursue a listing in Hong Kong. The planned delisting, uncertainties arising from its cybersecurity investigation and the lack of immediate prospects for a relisting, are set to deal a heavy blow to the company's value - and could even undermine investor confidence in Chinese stocks.

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. The China Securities Regulatory Commission, the country's stock market watchdog, said in a statement immediately after Didi's announcement that the ride-hailing firm's delisting plan had nothing to do with other US-listed Chinese stocks and was not related to ""the ongoing audit cooperation between China and the US"", in an apparent move to control any spillover damage from Didi's statement. According to the Didi statement, it must cooperate further with China's cybersecurity regulators in the investigation and conduct rectifications. Didi angered China's cybersecurity authority by forcing its way to an IPO in the US without Beijing's full consent, the Post reported earlier. As a result, government authorities led by the powerful Cyberspace Administration of China ordered app stores to remove 25 mobile apps operated by Didi and told the company to stop registering new users last summer on national security grounds. A government task force, including delegates from China's Ministry of Public Security and Ministry of State Security, entered Didi premises last July to carry out an investigation, but the task force has not published any findings or conclusions. The firm reported total revenue of 40.8 billion yuan (US$6.4 billion) for the fourth quarter of 2021, a decline of 12.6 per cent when compared with the same period a year ago, Didi said in a separate statement. Meanwhile, Tencent Holdings president Martin Lau Chi-ping has left Didi's board of directors. He was replaced by Liang Fengxia, who is associate general counsel at Tencent.

4/18/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) - British employers are offering annual pay settlements worth an average increase of 2.8% to staff, well below the rate of inflation, a survey showed on Monday. The Chartered Management Institute said many businesses were wary of offering pay rises when other costs were soaring and some feared that consumer demand would soon falter. ""We've not really seen the full effects of the Ukraine conflict filter through yet, and it's clear that pressure is mounting across the board and there are undoubtedly some rocky times ahead,"" Anthony Painter, the CMI's director of policy, said. Pay settlements in the private sector averaged 3.2%, compared with 2.4% in the public sector, the CMI data showed, roughly in line with other similar surveys. While bigger pay rises would help ease the cost of living squeeze being felt by most British workers, the Bank of England is concerned that hefty pay rises could make it harder to get inflation back to target. Consumer price inflation hit a 30-year high of 7.0% in March, and some economists think it could reach double digits later this year. The BoE's own survey of employers pointed to pay settlements of almost 5% this year, far higher than the usual trend. So far there has been little sign of increases on that scale. Last month, pay data company XpertHR said the average award in the three months to the end of February was 3%, the joint-highest since 2008. Three percent was also the average pay rise that businesses planned for 2022 as a whole, the Chartered Institute of Pay and Development (CIPD) said. Average annual wage growth excluding bonuses -- which unlike pay settlement data includes raises due to job moves and promotions -- was 4.0% in the three months to February, according to official data published last week. The CMI survey showed only about half of firms surveyed between March 31 and April 5 had definitely decided to raise pay this year, with 48% either deciding against a raise or unsure. By contrast, the XpertHR and CIPD surveys have previously shown less than 10% of employers intended to freeze pay.

Bitcoin (BTC): $39,928 -1.20% Ether (ETH): $3,O26 -1.23% Bitcoin, other major cryptos were flat for the holiday weekend Bitcoin ended the week perched roughly where it spent much of the past few days, a little above $40,000, and with few signs of a rally. ""Last week we shared concerns around Bitcoin's ability to maintain upward momentum,"" Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of fund manager BitBull Capital, wrote in comments to CoinDesk. ""We highlighted $40K as the struggling point on the downside and that has been the state of the market this week."" The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $39,928, a little down from where it stood 24 hours earlier and about the same as where it started the Good Friday, holiday weekend. Ether, the second largest crypto by market cap, was trading at about $3,026, a level from which it has barely budged since last Monday. Other major cryptos were largely in the red, albeit slightly, although SOL was one of the few exceptions rising about 1%. Trading over the long weekend was light as investors continue to process rising inflation, the possibility of a recession and the latest developments from Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Markets, which were closed Friday, were down on Thursday with the tech-focused Nasdaq off more than 2% and the S&P 500 falling 1.2%. Russia pressed forward with its attacks on major Ukraine cities, including the capital Kyiv, and demanded the surrender of the strategic Black Sea port of Mariupol to the Southeast. Ukraine Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Sunday that discussions with Russia about establishing humanitarian corridors for civilians to evacuate major Ukraine cities had broken down. Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of fund manager BitBull was pessimistic about the coming week, noting that support could form well below $40,000. ""Things still don't look particularly bullish for Bitcoin, and we continue to look for a reaction around $37K,"" he wrote. ""For any upward move, BTC will need to consolidate around $42K in the coming week – an unlikely scenario in the absence of major news or catalysts.""

In early 2021 he held a seminar on that topic, and claimed to have an audience of 1400 firms. Having bitcoin in the corporate treasury alongside equities and bonds was supposed to cement the asset class in the history books, and lead to it hitting $6 million. A year later, corporations don’t seem overly interested. According to CoinGecko’s tracker of public companies there aren’t a lot of new entities that have added crypto to their balance sheet over the last year. The only non-major crypto or payments firm to have it is Tesla. Square has it as it allows its clients to trade crypto, while a few game developers have it as part of a Web 3 gaming push or because they accept crypto as a payment method. Saylor continues to add it to the MicroStrategy balance sheet, saying in a recent note to investors “Adopting bitcoin as our primary treasury reserve asset set us apart from conventional competitors and elevated our brand.” But he just can’t convince others to do the same. For listed firms, bitcoin is notoriously difficult to deal with from an accounting perspective. The narrative that bitcoin’s value will hit all-time highs because of corporate faith in it just didn’t materialize. But in this void, Terra has stepped in with its frequent bitcoin buys which have pushed the Luna Foundation Guard’s (LFG) bitcoin holdings to nearly $1.7 billion and founder Do Kwon has expressed a wish for that number to hit $10 billion. The current total makes Terra/LFG the second largest corporate holder below only MicroStrategy’s $3.9 billion. Does the market care about this narrative? Not really. The correlation between LFG’s bitcoin buys and the price of bitcoin is weakening; the last few buys didn’t stop bitcoin’s decline. Cryptoquant’s data suggests that institutional interest continues to be strong for crypto, but hedge funds, family offices and high-net-worth individuals aren’t listed corporations. They would have a different investment thesis, and tempo, than what Saylor prescribed for corporations. LFG’s mandate for buying crypto is also different from what a listed firm would do, and it is important is to look at the scale of the HODLing as well as the tempo. But LFG isn’t a listed Fortune 500 company, so the market doesn’t apply the same prestige to the purchases as bitcoin continues to stay correlated with equities and decline in value. Which, in turn, is the same logic that tells corporate treasurers that perhaps bitcoin isn’t the best asset for their books. Jack Dorsey, Block and the Perils of Making Crypto User-Friendly (by CoinDesk columnist David Z. Morris) Last July, payments startup/giant (can you be both?) Square announced that it would be developing a hardware cryptocurrency wallet. The prospect of a wallet designed by the same folks who build the world’s fastest-growing point-of-sale technology promised exciting advances in ease of use and adoption. And that was months before Jack Dorsey flipped the tech world table by resigning from Twitter to focus on Square (now Block) full time, even further upping the stakes. But, for perhaps the first time in Dorsey’s yearslong flirtation with Bitcoin (“crypto,” not so much), there’s a significant disconnect between his plans and crypto long-timers’ preferences. In a Friday blog post, Block announced that its hardware wallet would make fingerprint identification the primary and default method for users to access their funds. Block does say it will “evaluate additional access methods that customers could opt into.” At least in the case of consumer goods like cellphones, the motivation for adding biometric access control is usually simple convenience, but the ultimate implications could be dire. Another Web 2.0 holdover, Sam Altman, a former president of Y Combinator, a firm that helps funds tech startups, introduced a token called Worldcoin over the summer of 2021, and critics including Edward Snowden pointed out that the scheme would risk exposing users’ biometric data with potentially severe and permanent consequences for victims. When the ruthless capitalists at the American Enterprise Institute think your plan is anti-social, you know you’re in trouble. To be fair, the Block plan is different from Worldcoin’s in crucial ways that make it more defensible. In part because the planned wallet is a single-user device, it will be able to create and store its biometric credentials locally, as your phone does. Worldcoin, by contrast, seemed likely to require a centralized database of iris-scan hashes, an absolute five-alarm fire of poor security architecture. But even local processing and storage is a real risk – ultimately, no local data that can be reached via the internet should ever be considered truly secure. And the literally lifelong consequences of a compromised fingerprint make even the remotest exposure worth seriously interrogating. Equally worrisome, making a fingerprint the main way of authorizing a crypto wallet could mean less emphasis on private key management. That could introduce an added risk vector for users: if your hardware wallet is the only home of your private keys, and that hardware is controlled by a fingerprint, the risk of losing all your money just went up rather than down. Block seems well aware of the risks here, based on both the content and timing of the announcement. “We're aware of limitations [of fingerprint security] we'll need to design around,” the announcement states. And in the communications business, Fridays are when you drop news you don’t want anyone to pay too much attention to – reporters are largely finishing up their assignments and looking forward to a blissful weekend. So it’s a good bet Block was seeking to minimize blowback here. All that said, Block is trying to thread an extremely tricky needle, and its current plans deserve a thoughtful rather than knee-jerk response. The announcement post makes clear the priority was to design a wallet that can be used “securely, but with ease,” balancing user experience with safety. “We don’t want to force new behaviors on customers with a novel interface on the hardware component of the wallet we’re building,” the announcement continues. “Instead, making the mobile application the center of the experience will lead to familiar, intuitive interactions.” For better or worse, we’re very used to using fingerprint unlocks on smaller devices. So using them makes absolute sense from a Silicon Valley hardware designer’s perspective. The presumption that something should be a mass-market product, ideally usable by even the slowest kids on the bus, is baked into the business models and culture of even relatively agile entities like Block.

Morris - Jack Dorsey Takes Square Deep Down the Bitcoin Rabbit Hole The logic also, however, aligns with many calls within the crypto industry to prioritize making user experience better and more intuitive, not just for wallets but also for decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and everything else. The problem, as crypto and security experts including MetaMask’s Taylor Monahan have pointed out, is that a smooth user experience is almost inextricable from security risks. In fact, she specifically cites another “ease-of-use” feature that led people to not save their private keys properly. It's about a feature of an early version of MyCrypto/MEW, the wallet Monahan built before joining Metamask recently. Specifically, the feature was an automatic download/display of all the wallet information that people apparently forgot to write down pretty often. Ultimately, there will eventually be crypto products that strike the right balance between security and usability. But frankly, I think companies rushing in that direction now are shortchanging the entire ecosystem by de-emphasizing education. In fact, the assumption that front-end design can make a crypto system just as smooth and effortless to use as a Web 2.0 system may well prove to be fundamentally flawed: The complexity of crypto is inextricable from its decentralization, and methods of “abstracting away” that complexity almost always add new attack surfaces for people who want to take your money. 10 a.m. HKT/SGT(2 a.m. UTC): China gross domestic product (MoM/YoY March) 10 a.m. HKT/SGT(2 a.m. UTC): China industrial production (YoY March) 10 a.m. HKT/SGT(2 a.m. UTC): China retail sales (YoY March) In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV: Rethinking Securities Law in a Crypto Age “Money Reimagined” hosts Sheila Warren and Michael Casey were joined by securities law expert Chris Brummer of Georgetown Law School.

4/18/2022,"Tajikistan’s president traveled to the northern Sughd region on April 14 to oversee the opening of a new gold processing plant built by a Chinese investor at a cost of around $136 million. The enterprise, Talco Gold, will produce up to 2.2 tons of gold and 21,000 tons of antimony annually, according to government officials. China is by far Tajikistan’s main source of foreign direct investment. In 2021, businesses from China invested more than $211 million in Tajikistan, an amount that accounts for nearly 62 percent of the global FDI figure. Those funds mainly went toward the extraction and processing of lead, zinc, and tin ores, and the mining of precious and semi-precious gems and metals. Talco Gold is a joint venture between the Talco Aluminum Company, a Tursunzoda-based company said to be owned Hasan Asadullozoda, the brother-in-law of President Emomali Rahmon, and China’s Tibet Huayu Mining. The company has promised it will provide jobs for 1,500 people, most of them Tajik nationals. That prospect comes at a fortuitous time, just as Tajikistan faces the prospect of a fresh economic crisis precipitated by international sanctions on Russia, where hundreds of thousands of Tajiks travel annually for seasonal labor. Work on building the processing facility in the Sughd region, which will work with material mined at the nearby Chulboi, Konchoch, and Shakhkon deposits, had begun four years ago but was delayed by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Talco is ostensibly an aluminum concern, but it began to branch out in 2015 as a result of a state-designed program to prop up the company. As part of that program, the government handed the company a 25-year concession to the Konchoch gold and silver deposits. Chinese investments invariably arrive with many strings attached – not least because Tajikistan is deeply in debt to Beijing. According to the Finance Ministry, Tajik debt to China as of January 1 amounted to $1.1 billion, which is almost exactly one-third of the country’s overall external debt. Some economic experts cast doubt on whether China’s debt strategy for Tajikistan brings sufficient rewards. “China gives money as a loan to Tajikistan for specific projects, and often the parliament approves tax exemptions during the construction period,” one analyst told Eurasianet on condition of anonymity, as criticism of the government can incur reprisals. “Construction equipment is brought in from China, Chinese workers are engaged in the building. As a result, all the money goes back to China, and Tajikistan remains saddled with the debt.” By Eurasianet.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com: Oil Sands Financing From Canadian Banks Doubles India’s Russian Dealings Have Left Biden’s Geopolitical Oil Strategy In Tatters Tight Oil Markets Are Sending Fuel Margins Through The Roof Read this article on OilPrice.com",World/Oilprice.com•2 days ago,China’s New Gold Project Is A Double-Edged Sword For Tajikistan,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-gold-project-double-edged-190000371.html
