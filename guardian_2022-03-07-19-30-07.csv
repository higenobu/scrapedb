3/7/2022,"Never mind trouncing humans at video games and the ancient pursuits of chess and Go. Researchers have now harnessed the power of artificial intelligence to infer how pigs are feeling on the basis of their grunts. Scientists believe that the AI pig translator – which turns oinks, snuffles, grunts and squeals into emotions – could be used to automatically monitor animal wellbeing and pave the way for better livestock treatment on farms and elsewhere. “We have trained the algorithm to decode pig grunts,” said Dr Elodie Briefer, an expert in animal communication who co-led the work at the University of Copenhagen. “Now we need someone who wants to develop the algorithm into an app that farmers can use to improve the welfare of their animals.” Working with an international team of colleagues, Briefer trained a neural network to learn whether pigs were experiencing positive emotions, such as happiness or excitement, or negative emotions, such as fear and distress, using audio recordings and behavioural data from pigs in different situations, from birth through to death. Writing in the journal Scientific Reports, the researchers describe how they used the AI to analyse the acoustic signatures of 7,414 pig calls recorded from more than 400 animals. While most of the recordings came from farms and other commercial settings, others came from experimental enclosures where pigs were given toys, food and unfamiliar objects to nose around and explore. The scientists used the algorithm to distinguish calls linked to positive emotions from those linked to negative emotions. The different noises represented emotions across the spectrum and reflected positive situations, such as huddling with littermates, suckling their mothers, running about and being reunited with the family, to negative situations ranging from piglet fights, crushing, castration and waiting in the abattoir. The researchers found that there were more high-pitched squeals in negative situations. Meanwhile, low-pitched grunts and barks were heard across the board, regardless of their predicament. Short grunts, however, were generally a good sign of porcine contentment. “There are clear differences in pig calls when we look at positive and negative situations,” Briefer said. “In the positive situations, the calls are far shorter, with minor fluctuations in amplitude. Grunts, more specifically, begin high and gradually go lower in frequency.” According to the researchers, the algorithm correctly classified 92% of the calls as positive or negative emotions. With more recordings, the pig translator may be able to learn to distinguish a broader repertoire of emotions and shed light on the mental wellbeing of other animals. While farmers tend to recognise that the mental health of animals is important for their wellbeing, the majority of animal welfare efforts focus on physical health. Briefer and her colleagues believe their algorithm can pave the way for new automated systems in the livestock industry that monitor sounds on farms and other sites to assess the animals’ psychological wellbeing.",News/Science,Grunt of the litter: scientists use AI to decode pig calls,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/07/scientists-use-ai-to-decode-pig-calls
3/7/2022,"Films about dysfunctional families often call to mind Tolstoy’s line from the opening of Anna Karenina: “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” It struck me that the opposite might be true watching this thoughtful, gentle debut from the Portuguese visual artist Catarina Vasconcelos: a lyrical, introspective love letter to her family, gorgeously shot on 16mm. It’s a kind of fictionalised art documentary that for the first hour or so is essentially about Vasconcelos’s grandparents’ life together. It begins with her elderly grandfather Henrique (played by José Manuel Mendes) moving into residential care. In voiceover Henrique talks tenderly to his wife, Beatriz, who died of a stroke in 1984. He was a sailor by trade, away at sea for long stretches of married life; he missed births and milestones, and didn’t meet one of his daughters until she was four. We watch a dramatisation of their marriage; Beatriz talks as well; so too do other members of the family, including their eldest son Jacinto, the director’s father. To her family Beatriz is a tree, a practical woman with deep roots. For her, the children are like birds, who will fly away in time. This poetic voiceover is pierced with an ache of longing and loss. And it’s a film of extraordinary, beautifully composed images, each one like a painting itself: the strong capable hands of the family’s maid cutting a squash or closeups of the veins on a leaf. In the second section, Vasconcelos focuses on the loss of her own mother in 2003. In a tremendously moving scene, she keeps on screen a photo taken at her birth, the blissful moment her mother saw her for the first time. Over the top, her dad talks about watching her at 17 arriving at hospital to find her mother dead. The film isn’t really concerned with any bigger truths or issues but it will no doubt be treasured by the Vasconceloses; others may feel that it is a long time to watch the story of someone else’s family, however gently and poetically told.  The Metamorphosis of Birds is released on 11 March in cinemas.",Arts/Film,The Metamorphosis of Birds review – a lyrical love letter to family,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/07/the-metamorphosis-of-birds-review-a-lyrical-love-letter-to-family
3/7/2022,"The US and some of its European allies are facing accusations of double standards for supporting sanctions and international war crimes investigations against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine while blocking them over Israeli military actions in the occupied Palestinian territories. But pro-Israel groups in the US have dismissed the allegations by accusing critics of exploiting Ukrainian suffering to draw false parallels. Last month, Amnesty International called for the UN to impose targeted sanctions against Israel after joining other human rights groups in accusing it of breaching international law by practicing a form of apartheid and committing a crime against humanity in its “domination” of the Palestinians. Palestinian officials and UN special rapporteurs on the occupied territories have also pressed for sanctions over Israeli land seizures in the West Bank, the blockade of Gaza and the large scale killing of Palestinian civilians. While pressing for action against Russia, however, the US and other governments have resisted similar measures against Israel. On Tuesday, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, told the UN human rights council that it must send a “resolute message” to Vladimir Putin to stop an invasion that has destroyed schools, hospitals and residential buildings, and killed hundreds of civilians. “These are the human rights abuses this council was created to stop. If we cannot come together now, when will we come together?” he said. In the same speech, Blinken made point of calling ongoing UN human rights council investigations into Israeli actions in the occupied territories “a stain on the council’s credibility” and called for them to be halted. The investigations have found Israel responsible for persistent “violations of the right to life” and other crimes. Sarah Leah Whitson, the former director of Human Rights Watch’s Middle East division, said there are clear parallels between Russian and Israeli violations of international law, including the committing of war crimes. “We see that not just the US government but US companies are falling over themselves to sanction and boycott anything that has an association with the Russian government,” she said. “Contrast that with the exact opposite when it comes to sanctioning Israel for its violations of international law to the point where American states are passing laws to punish Americans unless they promise never to boycott Israel. It’s very clear that the grounds for resisting sanctions on Israel, or even compliance with international law, is purely political.” Lara Friedman, president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace, contrasted American support for sanctions against Russia with attempts in Congress to outlaw boycotts in the US of Israel or its settlements in the Palestinian territories. James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute in Washington, compared the portrayal of Ukrainians throwing petrol bombs as heroic defenders of their territory to Palestinians characterised as terrorists or militants for resisting occupation and land seizures by Israel. The US is not alone in facing accusations of hypocrisy. The UK and Canada led calls for the International Criminal Court to investigate Russian war crimes in Ukraine. Last year, the two countries said the ICC should drop an investigation of Israel in part on the grounds that Palestine is not a sovereign country, although it is recognised as a state by the UN. In Britain, the Labour MP Julie Elliott told parliament that there is a double standard when it comes to standing up for Palestinians. “The Palestinians are looking to us to speak and act in the same terms. We sanctioned Russia over Crimea, and we are now likely to impose more sanctions, with which I wholeheartedly agree, yet Palestinians ask why we do nothing to end Israel’s occupation,” she said. Critics have also accused international footballing bodies of contradictory policies. UEFA fined the Scottish premier league team Celtic after its fans flew Palestinian flags at international games, saying that they were political symbols. Ukrainian flags have been widely flown at recent matches with the approval of footballing authorities.Israel’s supporters have pushed back by denying there is any parallel. Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, a prominent pro-Israel group based in New York, said the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is “a dispute over territory by two peoples who both have historic claims and connections”. “To compare this complexity to Russia’s brute use of force against the sovereign & peaceful nation of Ukraine is to intentionally misrepresent the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and is deeply insensitive to the security and humanitarian crisis confronting Ukrainians today,” he tweeted. The Jerusalem Post also dismissed what it called the “disingenuous attempt to link Ukraine with Palestinians”. “Sadly, some will only see that the Russians are the far stronger side in this war, that Israel is the far stronger side when it fights Hamas in Gaza, and reflexively just sympathize with the underdog, the weaker side,” it said. “Weakness, however, does not automatically bestow virtue. In the Ukrainian-Russian conflict, it happens to be that Ukraine is both the wronged party and the weaker one. But that is not the case with the Palestinians.”",News/World news,US accused of hypocrisy for supporting sanctions against Russia but not Israel,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/us-sanctions-against-russia-but-not-israel
3/7/2022,"Composition If I could tellthe story of my lifeit would be the branchdrawing its treeon the hard wet sand.It would be the man stoppingto erase the tidefrom his mind.It would be the wavessealing his shadowwith all the changesonly the clouds could bring. And if someone else could tellthe story of my lifeit would be the poemI never wrotefrom a book of poemsI never openedwhose page was missingonce all the leaves had gatheredon the porch to listen.It would be the man stoppingto adjust his postureon the abandoned road. This week we revisit the work of Howard Altmann. Altmann is a Canadian-born poet and playwright now living in the US: his Hungarian father was a Holocaust survivor. New readers might be interested in the poem and biographical material featured here. The term “composition” has a variety of associations, musical composition probably being the most immediate, but it’s in the visual arts that the term particularly focuses on aesthetic relationship – that of shapes, lines, colours. So in Altmann’s first stanza, the narrator’s personal story take its conjectural shape through images. These images aren’t static, but kept moving by present participles: the branch is in the process of “drawing its tree”, the man, “stopping / to erase the tide / from his mind” and the waves are “sealing his shadow” (my italics). All is in flux, and the scene reveals gradual discomposure. As the movie-like scene unfolds, it shows us the man walking along a seashore, then pausing. He needs to “erase the tide / from his mind” since the tide itself connotes erasure, and might bring about the destruction of the tree’s “drawing”. The waves seem to offer some refuge, but they can “seal” only the man’s shadow, and do this only by the tenuous means of the “changes” brought about by the clouds. Erasure seems inescapable. A common metaphor in English – the family tree, the branch of the family – is subtly re-composed in this stanza, so the branch becomes the artist, composing its severed tree in the unstable medium of “hard wet sand”. The mutations of light, shadow and atmosphere which “only the clouds could bring” perhaps implicitly contrast with severer, more tidal dislocation. They bring, at least, new aesthetic possibilities. In the first stanza, we understand that the narrator’s story may be impossible for him to tell. In the second, the story becomes even more elusive. A new direction at the start hands over the putative first-person narrative to “someone else”. The medium would be the narrator’s own – a poem. Still the existential loneliness returns to enfold the narrative. The story-poem is an increasingly forlorn hope. Negatives accrue, the page in the unopened book, even if it had contained the poem, is now missing. The assembly of “leaves” brings us back to the image of the tree and branch of the first stanza, while representing the scattered pages of the book. Although these witnesses might have assembled “on the porch to listen” – almost like children, perhaps – the story would always be “missing” or in some unavailable form. And so the protagonist halts, as he halted in the first stanza, his outward identity even less secure: “the man stopping / to adjust his posture / on the abandoned road”. The change of posture and the change of landscape leave an un-tellable story un-concluded. This stanza seems also to say that even a composition as close to the self as a poem is to its author can still fail to seal the broken historical and autobiographical narrative. At the same time, by a happier paradox, we have a poem that, while telling stories of erasure, achieves, as a composition, a final wholeness. Composition is among the 40 poems by the author translated into Hebrew by the award-winning Israeli poet and translator Tal Nitzán. Published by the Hebrew and world poetry press, Keshev, the collection appeared last summer: its title in English is Forgive Time. The original poem was included in Altmann’s collection, In This House (Turtle Point Press, US). You can discover more about Tal Nitzán and her writing at Restless Books, at the Poetry International archive, and at Lyrikline.",Arts/Books,Poem of the week: Composition by Howard Altmann ,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2022/mar/07/poem-of-the-week-composition-by-howard-altmann
3/7/2022,"When I was a baby feminist, I would argue with friends that public space was political. I had been radicalised by my teenage years, sick to the back teeth of street harassment from men who seemed to think that the streets were theirs to roam freely, while women were relegated to decoration. It wasn’t a regular occurrence, but it happened enough times to enrage me. Walking home from school in London, in uniform, I had been followed, had my arm snatched and had been approached at least once by a man who displayed stalking tendencies. As I grew older, I understood these actions as displays of dominance and I was disgusted. Alongside my indignation, I was crushingly disappointed. I had been raised in this city and hated that this kind of behaviour was an impediment to my teenage desire for autonomy and freedom. I had been navigating public transport by myself for years at that point, and it took me everywhere I wanted to go. Once I had exhausted my immediate surroundings on foot, I’d take the Piccadilly line to gigs at the now bulldozed Astoria on Charing Cross Road. I’d jump on the Hammersmith and City line, a portal to dancing all day at Notting Hill carnival. The Circle line made me feel like an intellectual in the museums of South Kensington. There was no option back then to outsource travel plans to a clever little app, so in order to go anywhere I, like everyone else, would have to study the tube map to find out how to get to my destination. If I was feeling brave, I’d sometimes jump on the tube at Turnpike Lane and work it out as I went along, peering at the mini maps inside the train carriage and looming awkwardly over whoever was sitting in the seat beneath. I didn’t need a car. The map in my pocket opened up my city. Wonder, exploration, ownership, reclaiming – these are all feelings I hoped to replicate when Emma Watson approached me to be a part of a project reimagining Transport for London’s iconic underground map. Alongside the American author Rebecca Solnit, we have replaced every name of a station with the name of a woman. A few years ago, Watson had been in conversation with Solnit, who had recently completed a book with the geographer Joshua Jelly-Schapiro. Nonstop Metropolis: A New York City Atlas is a book of essays highlighting stories of the city, complemented by 26 maps. One of the maps is a replica of the Metropolitan Transport Authority’s map of the New York City Subway. Every single one of the MTA’s 472 subway stations has had its original name replaced with the name of a woman or a women-led collective. The names were contemporary and historic, including people from the entertainment industry, writers, artists, agitators for women’s rights and a former first lady of the United States. Instead of subway stops named Penn Station, Bleecker Street and Grand Central, there was a station named after the Pulitzer prize-winning architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable, a station named after the musician Grace Jones, and a station named after the much-venerated black lesbian poet Audre Lorde. In her conversation with Solnit, Watson had expressed her admiration of this feminist version of the New York subway map, and Solnit had immediately suggested that they create a London version. The tube map has been reimagined many times before. Simon Patterson’s 1992 lithograph The Great Bear is the most well known. In this work, tube stations are named after famous people including religious figures, footballers and philosophers. A 2006 version of the tube map, published by the Guardian, endeavoured to illustrate the links between different British musicians and musical genres. Turner prize-winning artist Lubaina Himid’s 2011 work Moments and Connections echoed the tube map, too. A retrospective map of three key exhibitions she curated in the 1980s that brought black and Asian British female artists from the margins to the centre, an artery-like line cuts through the middle, naming almost all of the artists she exhibited. Their names are intersected by tube lines highlighting the creative groups, learning institutions, exhibitions and publications that have been key to Britain’s black art movement. The map was created prior to Himid’s 2012 Thin Black Line(s) exhibition at Tate Britain. More recently, in 2017, the art collective Thick/er Black Lines released a version of the map, titled We Apologise For the Delay to Your Journey, highlighting unsung black British women and femmes of the art world. And in 2021, Transport for London, alongside the Black Cultural Archives, released a black history tube map, putting front and centre the historic contributions of black Londoners to the city. Everyone who remakes the map knows in their bones that there is power in a name. So many different maps, signposting so much brilliant work. Yet today’s official tube map has only three stops named after women. Seven Sisters station is named after the Hibbert sisters, who lived during the late 19th century and are known for each planting a tree in the area. The other two stations are named after Queen Victoria (the obvious – Victoria station; but Lancaster Gate is also named after one of her royal titles). In fact, many of the London Underground’s station names honour landowners, or members of the monarchy. The average tube traveller might not know that Leicester Square was named after Robert Sidney, the second earl of Leicester, or that Latimer Road station was named after the wealthy merchant Edward Latymer. But each man’s legacy lives on in the naming. So many statues and placenames work to memorialise the power of their day, signalling that the general public should concern themselves with deference towards those who accumulate capital or own land. The City of Women London map centres different values. This map celebrates women and non-binary people with deep ties to the city. These are people who have achieved extraordinary things in their field, scaled new heights or served as the nucleus of social movements. We’ve tried our hardest to place each woman or non-binary person at a station that has relevance to their lives, whether it be that they lived, grew up, organised or worked in the area. Some of our stations are named after wealthy people, but they aren’t on the map simply because of what they owned. Some are British, others were born overseas. On this map are people who have stretched the possibilities of what a woman could be. Among them are Claudia Jones, the journalist, black feminist and one of the founders of the Notting Hill carnival, and the fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, whose clothes made an indelible mark on London via the legacy of its punk scene. Some of our tube stops celebrate collectives, instead of individuals. Their names represent historic sites of women-led protest. We’ve placed two black feminist organisations – Awaz, the UK Asian women’s collective; and Owaad, the Organisation of Women of African and Asian Descent – at Heathrow Terminals 2 & 3. In 1979, they organised a picket at Heathrow to protest against the British government’s invasive virginity testing of migrant women arriving in the country. At the opposite end of the map, there was for us no other option for Bow Road than the match girls. Another powerful women’s collective, operating almost 100 years earlier in London’s East End, the 1,400 working-class women and girls working in Bryant & May’s match factory in Bow went on strike, and changed the course of Britain’s labour movement. Our map also commemorates sites of tragedy. Victoria station is renamed after the transport worker Belly Mujinga, who died of Covid-19 complications during the first UK-wide lockdown. The now closed Holloway women’s prison also takes a space on the map. It’s a place where feminist activists have long been imprisoned for their political action, from suffragists in the early 20th century, to the women of Greenham Common peace camp in the 80s. The feminist direct-action group Sisters Uncut occupied the visitor centre in 2017, writing in the Guardian that: “Prisons are an inhumane response to the social problems faced by vulnerable women.” One of those vulnerable women was Sarah Reed, a young black woman with a history of mental health problems, who in 2016 was found dead in her cell after being denied appropriate medical care. Just four years before, she faced an incident of shocking brutality also at the hands of the state: she had been attacked by a Metropolitan police officer who had accused her of shoplifting. The police officer was later convicted of common assault for the attack. In marking these tragedies, we aim to commemorate people who have been failed by our society, as well as those who have defied the odds. London has long been a site of protest, common cause, collectivism and collaboration. It’s a city where decadence and extreme poverty live cheek by jowl. It’s a place where women from all over the world have moved in order to unfurl into their truest selves, often in collaboration with one another. This map might not change the world, but I hope it prompts you to take a second glance at places you might once have taken for granted, to imagine the lives lived by the women before you, and to think of the possibilities of what you might create. This map is a counter to any assertion that the city isn’t for us.

3/7/2022,"Skiing in the sun with big-mountain views, dining on cheese fondue and finishing the day in a luxurious hotel room with a beautiful bathtub. It might sound like the stuff of Alpine dreams, but you can keep your wooden chalets and scenic Swiss valleys – I can’t afford them anyway. I’m getting all of this on a ski-and-city break in Glasgow. Well. Sort of. The skiing part of the holiday is actually happening at Glencoe Mountain Resort in the Scottish Highlands. I won’t be attempting to clip in and ski past Greggs on Buchanan Street in the city centre. Scotland’s largest city is snow-free at the moment, with the exception of the year-round snowdome at XSite Braehead, a 15-minute drive down the M8. It’s here that Ellis Brigham Mountain Sports are making the dream of a car-free ski weekend in Glasgow a possibility. The shop has just launched a new mountain shuttle bus to ferry snowsports enthusiasts from Braehead to the ski resorts of Glencoe or Glenshee every weekend, taking the hassle out of driving up yourself, while cutting carbon emissions by pooling a ride. The bus departs at 7am (hire is available from 6am) and arrives in time for the first lift. You’re then free to ski the day away, before getting the bus back after thelifts shut around 4.30pm. All going to plan, you’ll be back in Glasgow for 7pm for your après ski, whether that means fondue and fine dining or a bottle of Buckie and a munchie box (a smorgasbord of the tastiest, unhealthiest food in the world, from pizza and chips to doner meat and pakoras, available from any good Glaswegian takeaway). “A lot of our customers have told us they’ve given up their cars,” Alex McAlindon, manager of Ellis Brigham at Braehead, tells me. “They’re working from home now, so they don’t need their vehicles, or they’re making a moral, environmental choice. The resorts always struggle to fit cars in, too. One coach can take 30 cars out of the car parks.” I choose from a superb selection of the latest rental demo gear, settling on a set of Salomon S/Force skis. The bus fills with a mix of veteran skiers, newbies and a few hikers catching a ride. The early start means a sleepy atmosphere on the scenic journey – including sunrise over Loch Lomond – but a couple of hours later, me and my fancy skis are rolling into Glencoe via “the Skyfall road” (which featured in the Bond movie). Scottish skiing gets a bit of flack for the unpredictable weather, but if the wind doesn’t blow you away, the views certainly will. The mightyBuachaille Etive Mòr stands on one side of Glencoe. It’s a proper mountain – the kind of rugged, triangular beast a four-year-old child would draw. On the other side of the valley is the West Highland Way, winding past the Kingshouse Hotel and on to the Devil’s Staircase path and Fort William. Glencoe Mountain Resort opened in the 1950s on the northern slopes of Meall a’ Bhuiridh and is Scotland’s oldest lift-served ski area. The access lift transports us from the base station to the plateau over beautiful cascading waterfalls. There’s not a lot of snow at base level, but we ascend into the white stuff, and when the plateau comes into sight, it’s covered. The resort has seen substantial upgrading since it was taken over by current managing director Andy Meldrum in 2009, but the elements can still play havoc. He tells me the lifts were hit by lightning last week, forcing them to rely on generators for a couple of days. And a new base cafe is being built to replace the one that burned down on Christmas Day in 2019. “You just accept that sometimes things don’t go your way,” says Meldrum. “Staff and customers are so supportive, though. The skiing can be as good as anywhere in Europe. It can be pretty miserable too, but you do get stunning conditions.” The views over Rannoch Moor from the top prove Meldrum’s point. To the west are challenging routes, including Flypaper, the steepest in-boundary run in the UK, while to the east are some of the most scenic blue runs on the continent: wide, exposed slopes backdropped by the Buachaille. The clouds clear as I sip a hot chocolate at the Plateau Cafe, and though there is the odd 35mph gust of wind, blowing snow sideways into my face, it’s a glorious afternoon. Still, Meldrum says the best is yet to come at Glencoe: “We tend to have storms in January and February, then the weather settles. We normally ski right through to the end of April or beginning of May.” As with all good things, the end of the day comes too soon. On the bus journey home skiers sleep or chat through their day on the hill. After dropping off our gear, my partner and I jump in a taxi and head out for some après. This is where the city-and-ski idea comes into its own. Glasgow is like Mayrhofen but with less oompah music and a lot more people. There are plenty of spas and saunas if you want the full alpine treatment, but perhaps more appealing is the nightlife, which is among the best in the UK. The vibrant east end is home to the Barrowlands, the centre to the wonderful King Tut’s music venue and legendary Sub Club. We head to Brel, a Belgian restaurant set among the fairy lights of Ashton Lane in the glitzy west end. An excessive portion of melted cheese and beer by the tankard seems an apt choice. Then it’s back to the boutique Alamo Guest House to stay in a hotel room significantly nicer than most ski resorts I’ve stayed, in a restored Victorian townhouse on the edge of Kelvingrove Park and the famous Art Gallery and Museum. As it falls into darkness outside, I run a bubble bath and finish my night bathing in that most restorative of substances – Scottish tap water. Scottish skiing might be unpredictable, but when it’s good, it’s great. Add in a weekend in Glasgow, and it’s an absolute winner. Accommodation at the Alamo Guest House was provided by Visit Scotland (doubles from £76 B&B). The Mountain Shuttle (£25 return + booking fee) was provided and operated by Ellis Brigham Mountain Sports and will run to Glencoe every Saturday and Glenshee every Sunday until the end of the season (usually until late April/early May). Lift passes for Glenshee should be bought in advance. Lift passes for Glencoe can be purchased on the bus. Ski or snowboard rental for the day costs £25 (bring own boots or hire in resort).

3/7/2022,"The Conservative peer Greg Barker has resigned as chairman of EN+, the mining company part-owned by the sanctioned Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. Lord Barker, an energy minister in David Cameron’s government, oversaw a plan to help the firm respond to US government sanctions levelled against the company and Deripaska in 2018, when it sanctioned the oligarch over his alleged links to the Russian government. Deripaska has previously said the US allegations were based on “false rumour and innuendo”. Barker’s resignation comes amid intense scrutiny of companies linked to sanctioned Russian oligarchs, alleged by authorities in the US, EU and UK to be part of the system through which Vladimir Putin controls the Russian economy. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the London Stock Exchange last week suspended trading in EN+ along with more than 30 other Russian-linked firms, “in light of market conditions, and in order to maintain orderly markets”. While Barker will step down as chairman of the listed company, EN+ on Monday confirmed reports that it is considering carving out a large part of the aluminium business, which includes the part-owned subsidiary Rusal. The new company would be owned by management and non-Russian investors, and potentially led by Baker, according to a report by Bloomberg News that was referenced by EN+. It would take on Rusal’s alumina, bauxite and aluminium assets across the globe, including in Africa, Australia and Europe. Barker’s role with the company has proven highly controversial ever since he joined but pressure has mounted in recent days amid strong criticism from Conservative party colleagues and scrutiny on directorships in companies linked to Russian oligarchs. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, last month said Barker should quit all Russia-related roles. “I think Lord Barker should explain why he works with people like Deripaska,” he said. Barker had served as a minister for energy and climate change in Cameron’s government but he has since earned millions of pounds for chairing EN+, including $7.8m in salary and bonuses in 2019 after he conceived the “Barker plan” to avoid US sanctions directly on the company. EN+ is still thought to make monthly reports to US authorities to ensure it is not breaching the terms of the agreement. In a statement to the stock market, EN+ said: “The group confirms that it is currently reviewing its strategy with respect to Rusal. Options under consideration include the possibility of carving out Rusal’s international business.” The plan was at “a preliminary stage” and the company will talk further to regulators and key stakeholders, the statement said. Barker will continue to chair the group for a “short period” before handing over to Christopher Bancroft Burnham, the company’s senior independent director. Burnham is a US national who lists a Kaliningrad correspondence address with Companies House.

3/7/2022,"Ukraine has criticised a proposal by Moscow to open refugee corridors as “completely immoral” after the Russian defence ministry announced that civilians fleeing some cities would only be allowed to leave for Belarus or Russia. As Russian forces continued to pound Ukrainian cities, with rockets hitting residential buildings, Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff, said negotiations were under way with Russia on establishing safe routes out. But humanitarian corridors were unlikely to be set up while Russian forces keep trying to advance, Arestovich said, adding that although Ukrainians should be able to decide individually where they wanted to go, evacuating to Russia was not advisable. A spokesperson for the Ukrainian presidency, meanwhile, said people must be allowed to flee their homes through Ukrainian territory. “This is a completely immoral story. People’s suffering is used to create the desired television picture,” he said. On Monday, Russia announced humanitarian corridors would open in several Ukrainian cities, a day after some of the hundreds of thousands of civilians trying to flee cities including Mariupol came under fire as they attempted to leave. The defence ministry in Moscow announced new plans for safe corridors out of the capital, Kyiv, as well as Mariupol, Kharkiv and Sumy, all of which have been heavily shelled in recent days, but several routes led only into Russia or its ally Belarus. Moscow said the routes would open at 10am local time after a “personal request” from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to Vladimir Putin. The Élysée Palace denied the French president had made such a request, saying he had asked for civilian populations to be protected in a call on Sunday. Russian forces continued their offensive on Monday, opening fire on the city of Mykolaiv, 480km south of Kyiv, Ukraine’s general staff said, while shelling also continued in the suburbs of Kyiv, including Irpin, which has been cut off from electricity, water and heating for three days. “Russia continues to carry out rocket, bomb and artillery strikes on the cities and settlements of Ukraine, focusing on the encirclement of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mykolayiv,” the general staff said, adding that the invaders “continue to use the airfield network of Belarus to carry out airstrikes on Ukraine”. A third round of broad ceasefire talks between the two sides was due to take place on Monday but with Putin vowing to achieve the “neutralisation” of Ukraine “through negotiation or through war”, hopes remain low for any kind of breakthrough. Kyiv continues to call for Nato to impose a no-fly zone over the country but the alliance has repeatedly warned that this would bring it into direct conflict with Russia, and Putin has threatened “colossal and catastrophic consequences” if the west attempts to keep Russian planes out of Ukrainian skies. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, however, said on Sunday Washington was “working actively” on a deal with Poland to supply it with American jets. The invasion has led to an exodus of more than 1.5 million refugees from Ukraine in what the the head of the UN refugee agency has called “the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since world war two”. Poland reported on Monday that more than 1 million people had crossed its border alone since 24 February. Many millions more have been displaced internally or trapped in cities being brutally pounded by Russian bombardment. Housing blocks, town halls, schools, universities and hospitals have been hit by missile strikes and artillery fire, with some areas reduced to rubble. The UN has said it has confirmed several hundred civilian deaths but warned the real figure will be much higher. There is also concern about the safety of Ukraine’s nuclear sites after a Russian attack on Friday on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest. The UN nuclear watchdog has expressed “grave concern” about the situation at the plant. A second attempt at a mass evacuation from the strategic southern port city of Mariupol on Sunday failed, with the International Committee of the Red Cross saying about 200,000 people were trying to leave and warning of “devastating scenes of human suffering” in the city. Civilians came under fire as they tried to leave many other areas including Irpin, where the mayor described seeing two adults and two children killed “in front of my eyes” when a shell hit them. Responding to the incident, the Ukrainian president, vowed to punish “every bastard’” who committed atrocities during the invasion. “They were just trying to get out of town,” Volodymr Zelenskiy said. “To escape. The whole family. How many such families have died in Ukraine. We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will punish everyone who committed atrocities in this war.” He called the destruction “murder, deliberate murder”. The UK defence ministry said on Monday the Russian tactics appeared to be “an effort to break Ukrainian morale”. British military officials have compared Russia’s tactics to those Moscow used in Chechnya and Syria, surrounding and pulverising cities. Russia has made significant advances in southern Ukraine as it seeks to block access to the Sea of Azov and establish a land corridor to Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. But elsewhere progress has become stalled, including an immense military convoy that has been almost motionless for days north of Kyiv. Western allies have imposed unprecedented sanctions against businesses, banks and billionaires in a bid to choke the Russian economy and pressure Moscow to halt its assault, but Putin has equated global sanctions with a declaration of war and warned that Kyiv’s intransigence is “putting in question the future of Ukrainian statehood”. The Russian rouble, however, has plunged to record lows, and dozens of multinational companies have severed or severely limited their ties with the country. American Express and accountancy firms KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers said on Sunday they would suspend operations in Russia. TikTok announced Russian users would not be able to post new videos or see videos shared from elsewhere in the world. The company blamed Moscow’s new “fake news” law, which makes it illegal, among other things, to describe the fighting as an invasion. Netflix also cut its service to Russia but provided no details. The US house speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said Congress is exploring how to further isolate Russia from the global economy, including banning the import of its oil and energy products into the US.",News/World news,Ukraine decries ‘immoral’ Kremlin offer of civilian corridors to Russia or Belarus,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/russia-humanitarian-corridors-ukraine-war-mariupol-kyiv
