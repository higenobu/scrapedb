2/12/2022,"Andrew Miller is interested in human failure – specifically “those sudden tests of worth and courage” which, if not passed, can destroy a life, as the exiled Hungarian playwright László Lázár finds in 2001’s Oxygen. Many years ago, a few seconds’ hesitation by Lázár led to his lover’s death, and he’s been trying to reconstruct his idea of who he is ever since. Miller’s novels are often built around such moments of disruption: Oxygen gives us not just Lázár himself, but the ironically named Alec Valentine, who is aware that he is letting down his terminally ill mother through his own incapacity to love. At other times the disruption is a broader failure to connect: in Miller’s 1997 debut, Ingenious Pain, we meet James Dyer, an 18th-century doctor who can’t feel either pain or pleasure, while 2015’s The Crossing features the scientist Maud Stamp (another of Miller’s carefully chosen names), whose blunt sense of purpose translates into a profound emotional isolation from those around her. Most recently Captain John Lacroix, the hero of 2018’s Now We Shall Be Entirely Free, set during the Napoleonic wars, is tormented by the mistakes he made during the British retreat to Corunna. Miller’s ninth novel revisits the theme, and it’s handled in a way that is bolder and more exquisitely menacing than anything he’s done before. Stephen Rose is a former soldier and recovering alcoholic who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. Thirty years later he’s living quietly in Somerset, trying to establish a relationship with his daughter, Maggie, whose upbringing he missed. He is in infrequent contact with Maggie’s mother, Evie (the memory of their youthful love affair is, as her name suggests, a lost Eden). Stephen has a job at a garden centre called Plant World: plants and gardens are important in a story that draws on the work of the Romantic poets in a way that’s unabashedly allusive, but entirely Miller’s own.  This Rose is, in William Blake’s phrase, sick. He has a canker, an invisible “slow worm” of regret, that is consuming his life. Like Lacroix, he is crucified by the memory of a particular failure of judgment: in this case, an incident that took place in Ardoyne, north Belfast, in the distant summer of 1982, when he was a new recruit to the British army. The question of what exactly happened that day (there are conscious echoes of Bloody Sunday here) is resurrected when he receives a summons to an inquiry in Belfast. Instead of responding immediately, he begins to write a version of his past for Maggie that’s both a confession and a love letter. It’s also a peculiarly moving account of casual youthful error, and of the hell that such errors can send us to. When Stephen says that the document he is writing seems like “a record of madness”, we believe him. Miller delineates the details of life in an urban barracks: the boredom, the pointless routine, the obsessive pursuit of order as a bulwark against introspection. He conjures the fear and the confusion of being out on patrol, “everything on you jangling, shifting, chafing, your breath coming hard”, with extraordinary immediacy. But he’s equally good at evoking its opposite, the dream of a pastoral escape, in the shape of the “damp, untidy acre of Somerset” where Stephen grows up and to which he retreats after the disaster of Belfast. For a while Stephen lives rough beneath apple trees, though this period is never sentimentalised (when a letter from Evie about their daughter doesn’t reach him, he remarks dryly: “Even in Somerset letters are not delivered to orchards”). We intuit that he might achieve redemption in this bucolic setting when he reads a biography of “the country poet John Clare” to his dying father, a countryman and lifelong Quaker. Clare, you’ll remember, had spells of extraordinary poetic lucidity, in between going periodically mad. So, what happened in Belfast? What did Stephen do? The revelation, when it comes, is unsensational: a pitiful, inadvertent atrocity, and all the more shocking for that. The title of The Slowworm’s Song is taken from an image in Basil Bunting’s poem Briggflatts, but the novel sits far closer to Clare’s ecstatic apprehension of the beauty and terror at the heart of the created world, and shares that poet’s awareness of the world’s relentless drive to renew itself. “I have been drenched, been drunk,” Stephen says, as Clare himself might have, “been right at the edge of what I could bear, and at times filled with a sort of simple hopefulness that seems to flow out of hedgerows and from the tips of grass.” At the level of the sentence, the writing is near perfect. But the novel’s excellence goes far beyond this. There’s a depth and a sweetness, a gravity, to Stephen’s simplest observations, such as his remark, of his dying father stumbling across the landing – “I know the creak of his sandals, the clicking of the little bones in his ankles” – that sets it apart. Miller is awake to the dreadful ordinariness of death (and life), in all its manifestations, and all its narrative forms. There are kinds of elective silence that shut down meaning, and others – the Quaker kind, perhaps – that open it up. As Stephen’s rehab counsellor tells him: “We have to be careful not to get trapped in our own stories. That’s one of the things we can learn.” Though the truth is elusive, it’s not impossible to discover it. “Are the men here not already real? Am I not?” Stephen asks after a rehab therapy session in which he’s challenged to access his “real” self. It’s all real, and all fictional, gorgeously so. You read what might have been a perfectly commonplace story of failure and redemption with your pulse racing, all your senses awake. Miller’s last novel didn’t make the Booker list, but this restrained, beautifully written apologia for our common frailty surely should.

2/12/2022,"After waiting 16 years to win a first Olympic gold medal, Lindsay Jacobellis captured her second in four days on Saturday after pairing with Nick Baumgartner to win the inaugural mixed team snowboard cross event. In a heart-pounding final race, Jacobellis frittered away the 0.04sec lead supplied by her team-mate in the first wave, but made a late move to overtake Italy’s Michela Moioli on the inside of the final right-banked turn and held on over the final jump to win by 0.20sec beneath heavy snowfall at the Genting Snow Park in the mountain village of Zhangjiakou.  Moioli and Omar Visintin settled for the silver medal, while Canada’s Eliot Grondin and Meryeta O’dine won bronze. Baumgartner, 40, and Jacobellis, 36, the elder statesmen of the US snowboarding team, become the oldest snowboarders to win any Olympic medal and the oldest Americans to win gold at the Winter Games since 1948, when Frank Tyler piloted the US team to victory in the four-man bobsleigh. “We’re 80s babies and we were comin’ in hot today,” said Jacobellis, who won Team USA’s first gold of the Beijing Olympics on Wednesday in the women’s snowboard cross final, the same event where she squandered a certain victory with a showboat move near the finish line at the 2006 Olympics, when she was 20. On Saturday, Jacobellis punctuated what may have been her final Olympic ride with a similar board grab over the final jump. “It’s the experience in snowboard cross, because it’s so hard to replicate the same scenario, because there’s so many uncontrolled variables,” she said. “It really helps to have the years behind you, so you can make the best execution and call what you need to do in that moment because you have mere seconds or less to make a decision.” In snowboard cross, which has been described as Nascar on snow, four snowboarders race simultaneously down an obstacle course with a series of jumps, berms, turns and drops. In the mixed team event, the men race first and the women follow with staggered start times based on their teammate’s finishing times. While the mixed team event was making its Olympic debut on Saturday, it has been a feature on the snowboard circuit for nearly a decade, including at numerous World Cups since 2012. The degree of difficulty for Saturday’s final was compounded by low visibility and -11C (12.2F) air temperatures in the mountains roughly 120km northwest of Beijing. Among those troubled by the conditions was Australia’s Belle Brockhoff, who was stretchered off the course after clipping another rider during her quarter-final race. The 20-year-old from East Melbourne was taken to a local hospital in a neck collar but was returned to the Olympic athletes’ village after CT and MRI scans revealed no serious damage, Australian officials said. Jacobellis said that she was able to use the fresh snow that impacted the conditions on the 1310m course to her advantage. “I tried to remember my old X Games days and jump as hard as I can on every jump to try to make the landing and use the draft when possible,” said Jacobellis, who becomes the second snowboarder to win two golds at a single Olympics after Russia’s Vic Wild won the the parallel slalom and parallel giant slalom champion in 2014. “I definitely am very comfortable riding very closely to other riders and then trying to execute off that speed that I gain from them.” The oldest snowboarder to ever represent the United States at the Olympics, Baumgartner gave an emotional televised interview after Thursday’s men’s snowboard cross, where a late wide turn in the semi-finals torpedoed his medal chances. On Saturday, the four-time Olympian could finally celebrate his first career medal. “It’s unbelievable, it’s days like two days ago that make today feels so good,” Baumgartner said. “These tears are so much better than the ones from the other day. I can’t tell you how much pressure is off you when you know you’ve got someone like Lindsey in the gate after you.” He added: “It’s tough to watch the young kids take over and try to push you out of the sport so that hunger is strong. And as long as you’re willing to put in the work, and you still have the dedication for the hard work, you can really push yourself to a new level.” The United States have now racked up five gold medals since Wednesday when Jacobellis ended the Americans’ longest-ever wait for their first gold at a Winter Games: three in snowboarding, one in figure skating and one in freestyle skiing.",Sport/Sport,Old dogs’ new tricks win US gold in inaugural team snowboard,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/12/old-dogs-new-tricks-claim-gold-in-inaugural-team-snowboard
2/12/2022,"Online shoppers in the UK can expect more identity checks – and probably more card-declined messages – over the coming weeks, as retailers get ready for new anti-fraud rules that come into force on 14 March. Buyers have already started seeing more requests to verify their ID as payments providers and retailers adopt the new strong customer authentication (SCA) rules.  Under the changes, before a retailer can accept an electronic (online) payment it will have to verify that the customer is who they claim to be. The measures are similar to those already faced by people logging into online banking. While most low-value retail purchases will go ahead as before, with checks carried out in the background, shoppers buying more expensive items online will have to input a password, a pin or a one-time-passcode they have been sent via a text or landline, or log into their banking app and approve the purchase. The rules, which have been introduced by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), were supposed to come into force a year ago but were delayed to give retailers more time to adapt. The legislation came out of the European Banking Authority, and was adopted into UK law before Brexit. It will apply to debit and credit card purchases, and will have the biggest impact on those making what are deemed to be the riskiest purchases. The new rules do not apply if you buy something over the phone. High-value purchases, or those outside a buyer’s normal spending habits or transacted on a previously unused device, are likely to prompt the extra security check. Mastercard says it expects about 25% of online transactions to require some form of extra verification by the customer after 14 March. Until now, only 1% of online purchases triggered the need to input a password, or similar. Under the EU rules, payments under €30 (£25) are considered low value but there are exemptions that mean that not all spending above that level will prompt SCA. Similarly, multiple low-value payments could prompt a request for verification. If you have already noticed it happening, it is because card issuers began declining some noncompliant transactions on 18 January as part of the “ramp-up” to SCA’s full implementation. There have already been some anecdotal reports of payments being declined. Before Christmas the FCA warned in an update that merchants that are not able to fully comply with anti-fraud requirements “risk their customers’ online transactions being declined”. Jana Mackintosh, the managing director of payments at UK Finance, which represents the banking industry, says: “Fraud is a growing problem, with criminals stealing more than £750m in the first half of 2021 alone. That is why it is more important than ever that additional protections like SCA are put in place. For retailers, implementing SCA will provide customers peace of mind that payment processes are more secure.” In 2019, the consumer group Which? warned that those without a mobile phone, or a signal at home, risked being disfranchised by the changes. The FCA appears to have taken this on board and has told the payments firms that it expects them to develop SCA solutions that work for all groups of consumers. “This means that you may need to provide several different methods of authentication for your customers. This includes methods that don’t rely on mobile phones, to cater for consumers who don’t have, or don’t want to use, a mobile phone,” it says. The relatively small group of people who shop online but do not use a mobile phone will have to choose to verify their ID in some other way. Those who have a smartphone but don’t receive a signal at home are advised to download their bank’s app, which will work over wifi. Nationwide building society is typical in that it has told its customers who do not use its banking app that they can opt to receive a code via a message to a landline, or by using their card reader and debit card. It has advised customers to make sure it has the correct mobile number, email address and landline, “so you’ll get any authentication codes we send quickly, and you won’t get interrupted while shopping online”.",Lifestyle/Money,UK online shoppers face more identity checks as new anti-fraud rules kick in,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/12/uk-online-shoppers-face-more-identity-checks-as-new-anti-fraud-rules-kick-in
2/12/2022,"David Friedman was Donald Trump’s ambassador to Israel. But that job title alone fails to adequately convey his proximity to the 45th president and his impact on US policy. Their time together marked a repudiation of Barack Obama’s vision for the Middle East. Sledgehammer, Friedman’s memoir, reminds the reader of all of this as insistently as its title suggests.  With Friedman’s assistance, the US helped forge the Abraham Accords, normalizing relations between Israel and four Arab countries. The US also moved its embassy to Jerusalem and left the Iran nuclear deal. As for the Palestinians, put it this way: they no longer occupy rent-free space in the Republican conscience. Unlike other Trump appointees, Friedman was often in the room when it happened. To all intents and purposes, he was not subordinate to Rex Tillerson, Trump’s first secretary of state. And as an enthusiastic backer of Israeli settlements in occupied territories, he had little interest in preserving the status quo. More than a half-century had elapsed since 1967 and the six-day war. Israel’s hold on the West Bank had grown organic. The Oslo Accords gave way to the second intifada and Gaza continued to smolder, despite Israel’s withdrawal more than a decade before. Godot had failed to arrive. Friedman’s book with its unsubtle title has a subtitle too: “How Breaking with the Past Brought Peace to the Middle East”. Obviously, he overstates. The Palestinians are not, of course, content. War rages in Yemen. Drones and missiles hit the Emirates. Things between Israel and Iran can get worse and probably will. Friedman was Trump’s bankruptcy lawyer. When Trump announced his presidential campaign, Friedman was doubtful. Both men venerated their fathers but, as Friedman acknowledges, they had little else in common. The author is still married to his first wife. Religion is central to his life. He is an Orthodox Jew, the son of a rabbi. While ambassador, his daughter made aliyah. That is, she moved to Israel and became a citizen. Friedman quotes a senior but unidentified state department aide as telling him: “Don’t be so Jewish. You represent the United States of America … Just a free word of advice.” Suffice to say, Friedman was not amused. Although he held a presidential appointment, he was not part of the club. Sledgehammer is also about ethnic grievance and expectations of Jewish solidarity – perhaps misplaced. Before joining the Trump administration, Friedman branded Obama antisemitic and trashed J Street, a liberal Jewish group, as “worse than kapos” – Jewish prisoners who worked as guards in Nazi concentration camps. Such intemperate comments came with a political cost. The Senate confirmed him by the narrowest of margins, 52-46. On the page, Friedman says those were sincere expressions. He used the term “kapos”, he says, because he felt “J Street had betrayed the Jewish people”. Elsewhere, he admonishes American Jews against criticizing the Israeli government. He laments a growing schism among US Jews, even while describing his own testy relationship with the Reform movement. In 2020, American Jews went for Joe Biden by nearly 40 points but Trump was the clear favorite in Orthodox enclaves. In Israel, Trump is lionized. “Loved” is Friedman’s word. He likes wielding his sledgehammer at the left. The right, not so much. He castigates Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, progressive Democratic congresswomen, for hostility to Israel. As ambassador, he was fine with an attempt to stop them entering Israel as part of a congressional delegation. On the other hand, he has nothing to say about Charlottesville in August 2017, its tiki torches and cries of “Jews will not replace us” and Trump’s view that there were “very fine people” on the neo-Nazi side on that day of violence and shame. Friedman’s outrage appears selective. He is also silent on Trump delivering a tart “fuck him” to Benjamin Netanyahu – Israel’s former prime minister and a Friedman friend – in an interview memorialized in Barak Ravid’s book, Trump’s Peace. Instead, Friedman swings repeatedly at Mahmoud Abbas, challenging the Palestinian leader’s desire to reach an agreement with Israel. Once again, Trump might well disagree. Trump told Ravid he believed Netanyahu “did not want to make peace. Never did.” As for Abbas, “We spent a lot of time together, talking about many things. And it was almost like a father. I mean, he was so nice, couldn’t have been nicer.” Friedman was particularly close to Netanyahu, so much so that lines could blur. According to Ravid, Friedman sat in on Israeli government meetings until he was tossed out by cabinet members. Friedman’s memoir does nothing to dispel that report. He describes his efforts to help Netanyahu cobble together a government. He zings Avigdor Lieberman, former Netanyahu confidant and current Israeli finance minister, for refusing to come to the struggling prime minister’s rescue. The fact Netanyahu was then under a legal cloud and now stands on trial for corruption escapes real mention. Elsewhere, Friedman criticizes Benny Gantz, Israel’s defense minister and Netanyahu’s jilted coalition partner. Although Gantz had been chief of staff of Israel’s military, says Friedman, he was not the politician Netanyahu was. Then again, Friedman also expresses his gratitude for his relationship with Gantz, who he describes as “6ft 4in and ruggedly handsome, an unusual look for an Israeli politician”. Trump too has praised Gantz, albeit at Netanyahu’s expense. What Friedman does next will be interesting. Like Trump, he has left New York for Florida. His book jacket posts a blurb from Nikki Haley, formerly governor of South Carolina and a potential candidate for the Republican nomination if Trump does not seek it. Friedman has also described Ron DeSantis, of Florida, as Israel’s greatest friend among all 50 current governors. Friedman is far from finished. Sledgehammer is not just a memoir. It is a well-written audition for 2024 and beyond.

2/12/2022,"Do we really deserve good TV? It’s a question I have been mulling over since being subjected to Starstruck (Saturday, 8.30pm), ITV’s bombastic new panel show designed for five or so million people to eat a takeaway to. It’s an over-glossy mashup of Stars in Their Eyes and The X Factor, which is very, very bad in a way that makes my soul feel quite empty and my mind quite blank. Is it just the presence of Olly Murs as the host that is doing this, or is there something even more ghoulish and hollow baked into the very format of it? The only way to find out, sadly, is to make me watch an entire hour of it so you don’t have to. This is the first time since writing this column that I am going to actively ask for danger money. Here is the format of Starstruck: instead of letting one singer trot out and do a celebrity tribute act, three complete strangers come out and sing the same song together at once – so three Freddie Mercurys might sing I Want to Break Free, line-by-line or three Ariana Grandes might squabble over a rendition of One Last Time. There is something very mildly interesting about watching three singers try to perform a cohesive song while also trying to outshine each other at the same time – fans of the Kitty Brucknell series of The X Factor will recognise this delightful energy from the group songs that used to open the show – but that’s where the entertainment begins and ends.  To judge the performances, ITV has assembled one of the strangest and most erratic judging panels I’ve ever seen on TV (we were warned when Amanda Holden started judging Britain’s Got Talent that this would happen to judging panels, but we refused to listen): Beverley Knight, an immaculately styled Jason Manford, Sheridan Smith and Queen singer Adam Lambert. Between them, they do all the TV judging tics and tropes they are meant to do – they put both palms flat on the table and lean forward, mouthing: “OH MY GOD!” to another judge. They clap above their head while standing up inelegantly in an outfit that is not designed to be stood up in, and hold their temples in sheer astonishment after hearing half of one opening note. They give each of the three teams effusive, breathless compliments, then at the end of the show the members of one team sing off against each other and the best performer goes into some abstract, distant “final”. The problem here is that a lot of the singers aren’t actually very good, so to hear the judges outrageously praise them rings utterly, dreadfully hollow. I am not going to name names, but at least three performers in the opening show deliver woefully flat notes (they only have to sing one-third of a song each! They’ve had all week to practise! Why are they still rubbish?) and a couple of them are quite noticeably out of time. I mean, this is fine – these are not sins – but if an idiot with a tin ear (me) can hear it, so can an audience at home. So when Adam Lambert throws both arms up in the air and says: “That. Was. Amazing!” and Beverley Knight says it was like “looking at someone famous”, you sort of go: well, it wasn’t, though, was it? They’ve spent more than six hours in hair and makeup and they are doing it on TV, and millions of people can see that it wasn’t very good. So why say it was good? Why is everyone in the studio clapping as if it were good? Why is Olly Murs laughing? He shouldn’t be laughing. He shouldn’t be encouraging these people. One immutable truth about this country is: we always think someone absolutely smashing it at karaoke is entertaining, and we will until the sun engulfs the Earth. But I can’t help feeling that Starstruck has been completely informed by the bombastic Saturday night TV that has come before it – that golden The X Factor run! The half-term-saving Britain’s Got Talent series! Dancing on Ice! The Masked Singer, almost! – in a way that feels as if it’s shaping future iterations of this, too. In 10 years’ time, ITV will still have a Saturday night singing show. In 20 years, too, and 30 more after that.

2/12/2022,"There may be bigger collisions to come in this Six Nations but this weekend’s Italian job holds plenty of significance for several individuals on England’s teamsheet. Fail to “light up Rome” as Eddie Jones has been repeatedly urging and the head coach may just consider pulling the plug on some Test careers. Shine in a ruthless all-round performance, on the other hand, and a brighter future may well beckon. Few would have predicted this reshuffled England combination even a fortnight ago and it feels like an appropriately thumbs up/down moment for certain players. Will Stuart, Charlie Ewels, Alex Dombrandt, Harry Randall, Joe Marchant and the fit-again Jack Nowell, plus the uncapped replacement Ollie Chessum, will all feel that this is an opportunity they badly need to take.  With Jones going out of his way to mention the seven injured senior players currently unavailable to him, last weekend’s loss in Edinburgh has further raised the stakes. While Luke Cowan-Dickie would probably have started again had he been able to train more this week, Jones appears to be stress-testing virtually every unit of the team ahead of loftier challenges down the track. Perhaps the most significant area of all, assuming Maro Itoje is not going to make a permanent switch to the back row, is the 8-9-10 axis of Dombrandt, Randall and Marcus Smith. Depending on your taste in such things, it is either the most exciting of English boy band trios or a major risk. Those who have been following the Gallagher Premiership for the last 12 months will almost certainly tend towards the former. Ben Youngs, now set to win his record-equalling 114th England cap off the bench, may not be among them but for anyone else keen to see what England can really do if they take the handbrake off the chariot and attack with the tempo, dexterity and verve of which they are capable, it promises to be an instructive afternoon. Given England have racked up 50 tries in their last eight games against Italy and average six tries per game at the Stadio Olimpico since 2014, however, the final verdict will not simply hinge on the numbers. The search for consistent English rhythm goes on and so does the slight sense of not, as yet, fulfilling their true potential. Playing Smith without his good Quins mate Dombrandt has always felt a bit like hiring only half of the Two Ronnies. With the nippy Randall between them, lightening quick and with a keen eye for a gap, the Azzurri are going to have their hands full if they give England time, space and a steady stream of quick ball. Which is where England’s rejigged pack come in. There were good aspects of Murrayfield – the return of the maul as a dominant weapon high among them – but Ewels and Stuart have been enduring a torrid season with Bath and will be want to prove there is a big difference between club and country form. The return of Jamie George and the myriad jumping options bode well for the lineout but Jones will be primarily looking for a collective reaction to the disappointment of the last quarter at Murrayfield. In short, England need to make a statement and Jones will not mind if there is a flash or two of anger in their demeanour. In midfield the latest partnership of Henry Slade and Joe Marchant also looks better balanced, even if Gloucester’s Mark Atkinson must be wondering what he has to do to get a start at 12. Jones, though, now believes the way forward lies in picking players capable of reacting on the hoof rather than sticking to set patterns largely dictated by the numbers on their back. As ever, it sounds great as long as it works. If it does not, England do at least have the insurance of a seasoned bench containing 409 caps, more than their entire starting line-up combined. There are almost echoes of 20 years ago when England picked the ultimate bench, comprising four England captains with 316 caps between them. The photo of Jason Leonard, Martin Johnson, Lawrence Dallaglio and Matt Dawson all taking the field together remains a classic but it does not tell the entire story. That same weekend France were scooping the title having previously beaten Clive Woodward’s side in Paris, making England’s comfortable win in Rome an afterthought. This time Italy may initially prove more of a handful than some anticipate with Kieran Crowley determined to instil some fresh zest into a side that has now lost 33 consecutive Six Nations games. If it is hard to imagine KC and his blue-clad sunshine band delivering the biggest hit in this fixture’s history, it might be a rockier first 40 minutes than the visitors expect. Equally it will surprise no-one if England subsequently enjoy a far more enjoyable last 20 minutes than they did last week.",Sport/Sport,Opportunity knocks for England youngsters in the Italian job,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/12/opportunity-knocks-for-england-youngsters-in-the-italian-job

2/12/2022,"Several animal charities offer help with vet bills to pet owners who receive benefits. Among the best known are PDSA and Blue Cross, which both run a number of pet hospitals around the country. PDSA offers free veterinary treatments and medications to pet owners who live within the catchment area of one of its hospitals and are in receipt of at least one of the following means-tested benefits: housing benefit, council tax support or universal credit with a housing element.  Only one pet per household qualifies for free help, although additional pets will qualify for the charity’s low-cost service. This offers cheap treatments and medicines, and is also available to pet owners who live near a hospital and receive benefits such as working tax credits, pension credit and the disability living allowance. Retired state pensioners who live in properties in council tax bands A to D may also qualify for help. The charity says its low-cost prices are typically 20% to 30% cheaper than private vet practices. Blue Cross offers free treatments – although it asks for a voluntary donation – to pet owners who live with the catchment area of its hospitals and pet care clinics. To qualify they must receive either universal credit (where there has not been a reduction in payment because of work or other income such as savings), income support, income-based jobseeker’s allowance, the income-related employment and support allowance or pension credit. Pet owners in receipt of other benefits may be eligible for reduced-price vet care. The primary focus of the RSPCA is to rescue and rehabilitate animals who have been cruelly treated. RSPCA branches may, however, in rare circumstances, provide welfare assistance to pet owners who can provide evidence of financial hardship who receive at least one state benefit. However, payment will only be offered when the procedure will result in a definite improvement in the pet’s welfare and he or she will have a good chance to recover and “live a long life”. In very limited circumstances, the charity may also assist pet owners with a contribution if their pet requires emergency treatment and they have exhausted all other avenues.

2/12/2022,"It promises to be the celebrity separation of the year, unfolding in a dizzying hybrid of IRL (In Real Life) and virtual spheres. The epic split between Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, with its generous cast of plus-ones, parenting responsibilities, brand fortunes, a family TV franchise, political and racial trolling, is a perfect divorce for the Instagram age.  The couple’s split appeared to be progressing smoothly enough, with West stepping in to dress Kardashian for TV and social balls. But with the introduction of new love interests, battle lines have been drawn. As ever, the couple’s children find themselves in a no man’s land in a parental trench war grinding back and forth. It began, after months of trailing previews, in February last year when Kardashian, 41, central star of the reality show Keeping Up With the Kardashians, underwear and beauty entrepreneur, and a certified criminal justice lawyer, filed to end a nearly seven-year marriage to West, 44, the rapper, record producer and Yeezy fashion designer, who recently changed his name to Ye. The couple have four children: North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm. At the time, Ye was at their Cody, Wyoming, compound; Kardashian at her spread, en famille, in the Hidden Hills of the San Fernando Valley, California. “He goes and moves to a different state every year,” she fretted. “I have to be, like together, so I can raise the kids.” Both parents have fortunes estimated at $1.8bn, though Kardashian’s Skims – initially fronted by Kate Moss – was recently valued at $3.2bn. “For so long, I did what made other people happy,” she told Vogue this week. “And I think in the last two years I decided I’m going to make myself happy. And that feels really good.” This week, she told Vogue her 40s were about “being Team Me”. But this is no easy split. Ye said he’s owed an apology from his in-laws for failing to give him the address to his daughter Chicago’s birthday party that included an allegation of kidnapping. The post has since been deleted. Then he asked his followers what recourse he had when their eight-year-old daughter North was “put on TikTok against my will”. “This is the kind of thing that really has affected my health for the longest and I’m just not playing,” he said. “I’m taking control of my narrative this year. I’m being the best father – the Ye version of a father – and I’m not finna let this happen.” Inevitably, whereas previous divorces of the century unfolded in society columns and gossip magazines, the Kardashian/Ye tussle hit social media. West was unfollowed on Instagram by Kourtney, Khloé and Rob Kardashian, by model Kendall Jenner and makeup billionaire Kylie Jenner, before Kim addressed the TikTok dispute directly. “Divorce is difficult enough on our children, and Ye’s obsession with trying to control and manipulate our situation so negatively and publicly is only causing further pain for all,” she said. She also made an appeal for privacy. The TikTok dispute has even worked its way into the political realm. Candace Owens, the conservative commentator, said Kardashian was “wrong on this one”. “The psychological effects of social media on young girls is real and documented. It’s actually Kanye that is trying to protect his daughter in this regard and Kim is spinning this as ‘obsession’ and ‘control’. There are other creative outlets for kids,” Owens tweeted. That, in turn, prompted Azealia Banks to come out punching for Team Kim. “Kanye is an abusive psychopath, it’s beyond mental illness,” she said. “Stop trying to help him and start trying to help the poor child that he keeps on trying to embarrass and abuse publicly to garner sympathy for his ashy ass.” To mere mortals, it can be baffling and confusing: a hall of online smoke, mirrors, likes and unfollows. “We’re talking about just two larger-than-life entities, who seemed like a perfect match who both love, cultivate and curate attention,” says Maiysha Kai, culture editor at the Grio. “They’re four children in and one marriage down and it’s unfortunate or unrealistic to think that given the platform the Kardashians built, their children would never be part of that.” To Kai, Ye’s positioning has a clear subtext – one familiar, perhaps, to many successful women seeking freedom from a husband. “I build you up, I make you into this thing that I want you to be, and then when you step outside of that I am angry and I will potentially lash out at you. It looks like he’s trying to reclaim some power in a situation that is largely out of his control.” “Out of control” is a description often applied to Ye in recent years. He has variously presented himself as a Trump supporter, and seemed to suggest in an interview that slavery was “a choice”. (He later apologized.) He made an unlikely and short-lived bid for president as a Christian revivalist. Ye said he and his wife considered terminating their first pregnancy – but didn’t after he had a “vision from God”. He’s also spoken of a bipolar disorder diagnosis. “Some in the Black community feel he’s racializing the situation and situated himself as a disempowered Black father in relation to a powerful white family,” says Kai. “He said slavery was a choice, right? So maybe he can’t have it both ways.” The Kardashian-Ye battle, then, is for personal and narrative control. Ye, an emotionally erratic musical, styling and branding visionary, played a large part in shaping her brand. He helped channel her LA style toward minimalism and advised her to simplify. “He expressed that there were too many branding situations,” she told the Wall Street Journal. “He’s always super simple. I really wanted to condense my beauty brands. I wanted one place, one website, where everything can live.” But there’s a branding and personal chasm now where Kardashian, with 302 million Instagram followers, meets West, with 11 million. It wasn’t always that way. As recently as last October, during a Saturday Night Live hosting gig, Kardashian was upbeat about the split and in praise of her soon-to-be ex. “I married the best rapper of all time. Not only that, he’s the richest Black man in America, a talented, legit genius, who gave me four incredible kids,” she said. Kardashian joked about her “movie” – a 2007 sex tape Kim Kardashian, Superstar, with her then-boyfriend Ray J: “I didn’t know it was even premiering.” But she could not resists a dig. Her divorce, she added, came down to one thing: “His personality.” But now both sides are also playing the field: in ways that only celebrities can. They flaunt high-profile dalliances with fellow bold-face names, insuring more coverage, more clicks, more shares, more branding. Kardashian stepped out with Pete Davidson, the comedian and Saturday Night Live regular. The pair have been spotted on dates and he calls her his girlfriend; her reciprocation is unknown. Well-timed promotional gloss is, of course, part of the Kardashian conglomerate’s branding genius, accompanied by reality or something designed to look like it, with the endgame of brand building in the most lucrative sectors of the luxury economy. There have been recent stumbles, though. Kardashian had her knuckles rapped for initially naming her underwear line brand Kimono, and for promoting a minor cryptocurrency, EthereumMax. Kardashian and boxer Floyd Mayweather have been named in a US lawsuit alleging they encouraged followers to join “the EthereumMax Community” and that the token itself was a “pump and dump” scheme that deceived investors. Charles Randell, head of the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, said in a speech to an economic crime symposium that he couldn’t say if the particular token was a “scam … but social media influencers are routinely paid by scammers to help them pump and dump new tokens on the back of pure speculation”. EthereumMax disputes the allegations. “The deceptive narrative associated with the recent allegations is riddled with misinformation,” a company spokesman said. Ye, meanwhile, has taken up variously with the Instagram model and Kim lookalike Chaney Jones, plus Julia Fox, 32, an actor, downtown New York art figure and podcaster of Spotify’s Forbidden Fruits. Ye and Fox met in Miami, and on their second date he gave her a room full of clothes and gifted her close friends baby Birkin bags. The couple have been documenting their romance in Interview magazine. Last week, Fox gave an interview to the Call Her Daddy podcast saying that being a (former) dominatrix allowed her to explore her sexuality. Fox, through friends, says she and Ye were “evolved beings” in an open relationship. “It’s a beautiful portal we all get to see into,” says New York curator KO Nnamdie. “Kanye turned his life into full art and they push each other into art. People like to think he’s doing a Kim-ification or Disney-fication on Julia, but he loves Walt Disney, and sees himself as Disney, as one of the greats. Which he kind of is.” Then Fox announced she was taking her posts down. “Suddenly Instagram was not a fun place any more,” she said to her 1.1 million followers. “I read the comments and everyone was like, ‘Oh my God, you clearly only posted photos you looked good in.’” Being near a messy divorce, it seems, does come with a cost no matter who you are. Which may in its own fashion be the truest statement of the whole unfolding drama. “Sometimes I don’t know what I’m watching, or if I want to be watching,” said Nnamdie. “Yes, they’re celebrities. Yes, they’re insulated. Yes, their money affords lots of things. At the same time, the real dynamics of divorce are playing out in living rooms across America.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Kim and Kanye divorce poised to be glitzy, messy and very public",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/12/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-ye-divorce

2/12/2022,"For the past 12 years Anthony Welch and his partner Theresa have been living a Robinson Crusoe life alone on a South Pacific island mostly untouched by humanity. Welch, a retired British property investor, hopes the tranquility will soon be shattered by 21,000 cryptocurrency investors he is trying to convince to move to his island and form a regulation-free “crypto utopia”.  Under Welch’s plan, the 3,000 square metre (32,000 sq ft) island, which is part of the Vanuatu archipelago between Australia and Fiji, would be transformed from 90% undisturbed rainforest into a “sustainable smart city”, filled with multistorey apartment blocks and offices for cryptocurrency investors from around the world. Watch our video & see how we're turning a dream into reality!Yes, we already own the islandYes, we can develop as advertisedYes, the government supports our planYes, our team has relevant expertise🏝️#satoshiisland a home for crypto enthusiasts & professionals worldwide! pic.twitter.com/1O05kmfrN1 Welch, who has renamed the island from its native name Lataro to Satoshi (in a nod to Satoshi Nakamoto the pseudonym of the person who invented bitcoin), has joined forces with cryptocurrency evangelists to create a “blockchain-based democracy” and “the crypto capital of the world”. However, Welch will first have to unwind his previous marketing of the island as a “wildlife nature reserve” home to rare giant crabs. In his previous attempt to sell the island for $12m (£9m), Lataro is described as an ecological paradise “covered in lush rainforests, together with a wonderful array of flora and fauna that’s been here for thousands of years undisturbed and will surely make anyone believe they have gone back in time”. A video promoting the island for sale in 2017 boasts that the 4 miles of “pristine coral reef surrounding the island is a marine conservation area” that “teems with beautiful fish and coral life”. It says only a handful of people have ever dived at the reef and “most parts of it have never been explored”. The Welches have previously petitioned the Vanuatu government to designate the island as a wildlife reserve to “prevent the extinction” of the rare coconut crab. “The ultimate goal is to re-establish the breed strongly on the island,” Theresa said. A website describing the couple’s efforts to establish the wildlife reserve was deleted soon after the Guardian approached Welch for comment. He said the reserve was “voluntary” and one that he could “dismantle at any time” to allow for the building of the crypto city. “This was the last place with coconut crabs, they [the local population] had decimated them absolutely everywhere else on Espiritu Santo [Vanuatu’s largest island nearby],” Welch told the Guardian. “We formed the reserve to try to stop them decimating them here to get the numbers back up … the government department for the environment have supported us creating a wildlife refuge here.” The Satoshi island project is the latest in a series of schemes aimed at bringing cryptocurrency fanatics out from behind the blockchain in their bedrooms and into real-world community in small island states. The president of Palau, another Pacific island nation about 3,000 miles to the northeast of Vanuatu, has launched plans to become “the world’s first government-backed national stablecoin” by the end of the year. President Surangel Whipps Jr says the country has partnered with Ripple, a US cryptocurrency firm whose executives have been charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission of stealing $1.3bn worth of the tokens, “to create a national digital currency, providing the citizens of Palau with greater financial access”. Plans to establish Cryptoland on an island in Fiji – where investors were told they would “enjoy a first-class crypto lifestyle” – collapsed earlier this month when the promoters failed to buy the island. Welch says Satoshi Island will succeed where Cryptoland failed because he and his partners own the island, and claims the development plans have the support of both the Vanuatu government and the local community. However, the Vanuatu government failed to respond to requests for comment, and Welch was unable to provide contact details for any current local residents. “We’re trying to build a community,” Welch said in an interview over satellite link to the island which currently has no mains electricity, water, phone or internet connection. “We’re not trying to develop and make a profit.” He said a team of cryptocurrency evangelists who had been searching the world for a location to form a “crypto society” approached Welch after seeing his island advertised for sale for $12m on private island real estate website. Welch took the island off the market and entered into a complex partnership with Hong Kong-based architect James Law, Australian crypto entrepreneur Denys Troyak and Daniel Agius, chief operating officer of the Vanuatu Investment Migration Bureau, an agency that sells Vanuatu citizenship. “The crypto paradise they want to build is a really cool idea, and a wonderful use of a place we have been able to live on for 12 years,” Welch said. “The team had been working to find a location for some time, the key issue was trying to find a government that would … permit a society to exist on crypto transactions. Most countries in the world want to collect tax, and they therefore don’t want crypto transactions happening because they can’t monitor what’s happening. Vanuatu has no income taxes of any sort.” The trio are promising 21,000 investors the island will “become home for crypto professionals and enthusiasts, with a goal to be considered the crypto capital of the world”. Cryptocurrencies are an alternative way of making payments to cash or credit cards. The technology behind it allows the ‘money’ to be sent directly to others without it having to pass through the banking system. For that reason they are outside the control of governments and are unregulated by financial watchdogs – and transactions can be made in a way that keeps you reasonably pseudonymous. If you own a crypto-asset you control a secret digital key that you can use to prove to anyone on the network that a certain amount of that asset is yours. If you spend it, you tell the entire network that you have transferred ownership of it, and use the same key to prove that you are telling the truth. Over time, the history of all those transactions becomes a lasting record of who owns what: that record is called the blockchain. Bitcoin was one of the first and biggest cryptocurrencies and has been on a wild ride since its creation in 2009, sometimes surging in value as investors have piled in – and occasionally crashing back down. Dogecoin – which started as a joke – has also seen a stratospheric rise in value. Sceptics warn that the lack of central control make crypto-assets ideal for criminals and terrorists, while libertarian monetarists enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank. The whole concept of cryptocurrencies has been criticised for its ecological impact, with ""mining"" for new coins requiring vast energy reserves and the associated carbon footprint of the whole system. Richard Partington and Martin Belam “Life on the island will be an experience like no other, giving the crypto community a way to live and work amongst like-minded people in a place designed around the industry we love,” they say on a website promoting the island. Successful applicants wanting to live on the island will be granted with a non-fungible token (NFT) granting them “Satoshi Island citizenship”. However, the small print details that they will also have to gain Vanuatu citizenship to live on the island. Vanuatu citizenship costs $130,000 and allows “golden passport” visa-free travel to 129 countries, including the UK and all Schengen countries in Europe. The country is heavily promoting its “citizenship by investment” programme despite concerns that the scheme has been exploited by fugitives, politicians and disgraced businesspeople. A Guardian investigation last year found that among the 2,200 foreign nationals granted citizenship in 2020 were a Syrian businessman with US sanctions against his businesses, a suspected North Korean politician, an Italian businessman accused of extorting the Vatican and South African brothers accused of a $3.6bn cryptocurrency heist. Vanuatu this month appointed Mayfair-based citizenship marketing firm CS Global Partners to attract more to buy Vanuatu nationality, which is granted with an online “oath swearing ceremony” and does not require the new citizen to ever visit the country. Selling citizenships equates to almost 50% of Vanuatu’s total annual revenue, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).",News/Technology,Bitcoin paradise?

2/12/2022,"Cicero, Leonardo da Vinci and Shakespeare all thought that eyes were the windows to the soul, but with due respect to the big dogs, I beg to differ. It is shoes which tell you everything. Hype trainers worn with a bland suit; teetering heels worn in defiance of practicality; scuffed ballet pumps; haute hiking boots or polished brogues – shoes hold the clues to what you do all day and how you get there, to whether you really want to be at the party and who you are going home with.  If you are wearing secondhand New Balance 550 sneakers sourced from Depop then I know, and I mean know, that you take your flat white with plant-based milk (pea, having moved on from oat) and are considering a star-sign tattoo. No offence to these creatives, but you can’t tell that from gazing into a pair of blue eyes. But the shoe currently worn both by anyone who is anyone and by everyone who is everyone else isn’t a “shoe” at all. Right now, it is all about slippers. In two decades of writing about every fashion trend you can imagine, I doubt I’ve ever written about slippers, but this most humble of footwear has finally left the fireside and entered the zeitgeist. For reference, see Jennifer Lopez at LAX dressed in the modern jet-set uniform of oversized oatmeal loungewear and designer sunglasses teamed not with Nikes or Ugg boots, but with Gucci’s furry slippers. Or Kendall Jenner’s new year weekend selfies, in North Face Thermoball indoor-outdoor puffer slipper boots (also known as sluffers). Net-a-Porter is leaning into the trend with Balenciaga’s creamy recycled faux-shearling logo-ed backless mules for £550, while Pangaia’s Jersey Sliders (£70), in a mix of recycled and organic cotton mix, come in a very non-pipe-and-slippers shade of flamingo pink. Urban Outfitters, retail’s spiritual home-from-home for Gen Z, has Ugg’s cult Fluff Yeah oversized chubby fur slippers (£60) in panther print or tie-dye. Let’s not forget either that Uggs were the shoe of choice for the late, great fashion visionary Andre Leon Talley, inside and out. At first glance, this looks like a world which has forsaken fashion for good. Karl Lagerfeld, who thought that sweatpants were a sign of having given up on life, must be turning in his grave at how lockdown’s home comforts have left us with zero tolerance for clothing that isn’t soft and squishy. Once upon a time, supermodels wouldn’t get out of bed for less than £10,000; these days, Kendall and co insist on being swaddled in cashmere, shearling or down-filled nylon at all times. Zoom having broken the fourth wall that once separated our public-facing selves from what we wore at home, we are comfortable being seen in any old thing – as long as it’s comfortable. But lean in a little closer, and you see that these slippers are not anti-fashion, but nu-fashion. All the major shoe trends of the past decade have been filtered into footwear you can wear when your outfit is accessorised by the telly remote rather than an evening bag. Furry shoes? They’ve been around since Phoebe Philo put fluff-lined pool sliders on the Celine catwalk in 2014, darling. Backless silhouettes? Some of us started wearing them in 2015 when Alessandro Michele did backless loafers in his first Gucci collection. JW Anderson’s cult padded crossover slides, a long-time front-row favourite, gave us the cartoonish proportions now found in flouncy high-street slippers. And what are North Face Thermoballs, if not puffer jackets for your feet? Wear your slippers with pride. Right now, they are as fashion forward as feet can get.
