1/23/2022,"Truckers are paid based on mileage but they're only allowed to drive for 11 hours each day. Electronic devices record how long they drive for — but truckers say these can be too restrictive. The limits could leave them stranded 30 minutes from home or stuck in a high-crime area, they say. It wasn't low wages, long hours, or a lack of benefits that drove Brian Pape out of the trucking industry. Instead, it was a tiny device that measured how many hours he drove each day and told him when to stop. ""That was it for me,"" Pape told Insider. ""I sold my equipment and I was gone."" Truckers are allowed to work for up to 14 hours a day, with a maximum of 11 hours driving. They can't do this all in one go: after eight hours of consecutive driving, they need to take a 30-minute break. These regulations have been in place for years but in 2017 the DOT scrapped the use of paper logs written by truckers and instead mandated electronic logging devices, known as E-Logs, that track when truckers drive and take breaks. Truckers largely say they're in favor of the hours-of-service regulations but that E-Logs were sometimes too strict and left drivers stranded close to home or a truck stop. ""If you're 30 minutes from home and you get to your 11 hours, you must shut down or else you get an automatic hours-of-service violation,"" Pape said. This incurs a fine and could jeopardize a trucker's license. Pape said that prior to the introduction of E-Logs he sometimes exceeded the 11-hour limit by around an hour to reach a certain destination, but never ""to a dangerous level."" Other truckers made similar comments to Insider. Mark Rumps, an Indiana trucker who runs the YouTube channel Trucking Answers, said that some companies even deliberately avoided using E-Logs by buying and refurbishing trucks with engines manufactured in 2000 or earlier because these are exempt from E-Logs. Pape said just two weeks using E-Logs convinced him to quit driving after around 13 years. Other truckers have been leaving the industry over low pay, long hours, and bad treatment from trucking companies, which has caused chaos across the supply chain. Colorado-based trucker Brian Stauffer said E-Logs were one of the reasons why he quit long-distance driving, likening them to ""trying to force a round peg into a square hole."" Stauffer said the ""maddening"" hours-of-service rules often didn't match drivers' body clocks. He said there should be exceptions, like if the driver reaches their 11-hour limit in a high-crime area and doesn't want to park there overnight. Most truckers are paid based on mileage. ""Driving time equals miles on the road and miles equal dollars,"" said Doug Watters, a Mississippi trucker who's been in the industry for almost 30 years. Stauffer said the hours-of-service policy ""forces"" truckers to drive even tired and go at high speeds to boost their mileage. But truckers said that, prior to the E-Logs, some drivers cheated on their paper logs and drove recklessly to maximize their mileage, anyway. And Rumps said that E-Logs held trucking companies ""accountable"" and meant they stopped pushing drivers to take more loads when they'd reached their limit. The dispatchers and trucking companies ""know now that they're gonna be held liable if there's any kind of evidence that they coerced or forced a driver to do anything out of the ordinary,"" Watters added. Truckers said E-Logs were more convenient than paper logs, and Rumps said that ultimately, they simply reinforce policies that were already in place anyway. ""The same hours of service are in effect,"" he said. ""Drivers were just violating them all the time to get home."" ""If you violate the hours of service that's because you're not being paid properly,"" Rumps added. Are you a trucker with a story? Email this reporter at gdean@insider.com.

1/23/2022,"Donald Trump's former lawyer claimed that Trump told him Donald Jr. should go to prison rather than Ivanka. Michael Cohen said his former boss gave the instruction when his children were on the verge of being indicted in 2012. Cohen was speaking to MSNBC about the probes into the Trump Organization and the Capitol riot. Donald Trump's former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen claimed Trump said that if one of his kids had to go to prison over the family business to ""make sure"" it was Donald Jr., not Ivanka. Speaking to MSNBC on Saturday, Cohen said Trump gave him the instruction when his children were on the verge of being indicted by the Manhattan District Attorney's office in 2012. ""You may recall that there was the district attorney's case here for Trump Soho where it was either Don or Ivanka was in very big trouble as a result of lying about the number of units that had been sold,"" Cohen told MSNBC's Alex Witt . ""And Donald said it to me – I mean I wouldn't say it if it wasn't said directly to me – he goes 'if one or the other has to go to prison, make sure that it's Don because Don would be able to handle it.'"" Cohen spoke to MSNBC about the mounting pressure on the Trump family amid the probes into the Trump Organization's financial dealings and the January 6 riot. New York Attorney General Letitia James has said her investigation into the Trump Organization has uncovered ""significant evidence"" of fraudulent and misleading asset valuations. James has taken legal action to enforce the subpoenas issued to Donald Trump and his children Donald Jr. and Ivanka, who she says were ""closely involved in the transactions in question."" Meanwhile, the January 6 committee investigating the insurrection has asked Ivanka Trump to voluntarily cooperate with their probe. Cohen said he believes there is ""not a chance"" that the former president would offer to cooperate with the investigations to shield his daughter from legal troubles. ""Donald cares only about Donald, more than he would care about his children,"" Cohen told MSNBC. Trump's former lawyer also said that he believes the chances of the Trump children cooperating with either probe are ""slim to none."" Michael Cohen served as Trump's personal lawyer for more than a decade before being targeted as part of a federal investigation into hush-money payments made to women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump in the 2000s. In 2018 Cohen pleaded guilty to several crimes he committed while employed by Trump and was sentenced to three years in federal prison. Since then, Cohen has been cooperating with prosecutors in several investigations into Donald Trump and the Trump Organization.

1/23/2022,"A silver Honda Accord zoomed past exit 150 on the Garden State Parkway in New Jersey just before 3 a.m. The driver was an off-duty Newark police officer, Louis Santiago. His cousin Albert Guzman was in the passenger seat. It was the night of Halloween 2021, and Santiago was drunk, according to Essex County prosecutors. He was staring at a cellphone when his car allegedly drifted into the shoulder and struck a man who happened to be walking along the darkened stretch of highway, prosecutors say. Santiago, 25, initially thought he may have hit an animal, according to his lawyer, Patrick Toscano Jr. The victim, Damian Dymka, 29, was still in the costume that he had worn out that night: a black mask with gold antlers and brown fur covering his shoulders. Dymka would be pronounced dead at the scene — but not until more than two hours later. In those two hours, Santiago drove home with Dymka’s body in the back seat and then returned to the crash site having never called 911 or attempted to render aid to the man, prosecutors say. “Put that body back where you hit it,” Annette Santiago allegedly told her son when he showed up at their home, according to prosecutors. He’s now facing 12 felony charges, including reckless vehicular homicide and endangering an injured victim. Guzman and Santiago’s mother were also charged with allegedly tampering with evidence and other offenses. Dymka’s friends and family, meanwhile, are still reeling in shock and grief. Some are tormented by haunting questions. What if the officer had immediately called 911? Could Damian have been saved? “We can’t know that because of one person who was incredibly selfish,” said Miranda Stone, a close friend who met Dymka when they were students at Bergen Community College. What makes the series of events so difficult to comprehend is not just the officer’s actions, his friends and loved ones said, but who Dymka was as a person. He was kind and compassionate almost to a fault, four of them said in interviews with NBC News. He was the one everyone turned to in times of crisis. He was the one who would drop everything to help you. “If things were going crazy, I remember just being able to hug Damian and feeling like it’s going to be OK,” said Jess Valdanero, a longtime friend. “He wouldn’t let go until he felt like you were OK.” It was fitting that he worked as a nurse, spending his days helping people who were elderly or infirm at a county-run facility in northern New Jersey. But by last fall, Dymka was ready for a change. He had developed an itch to travel, and his boyfriend felt the same way. So they hatched a plan: They would both pursue bachelor of science degrees in order to become travel nurses, a job that would give them the freedom to move away from New Jersey and explore the U.S. “We wanted a great way to travel the country,” said his boyfriend, Rosemberg Ochoa. “Hike national parks. Just roam around.” Dymka was set to begin online classes on Nov. 1 — the day after the accident — but he never logged on that day. He also didn’t show up for work at the Preakness Healthcare Center in Wayne, which was highly unusual. His loved ones would learn later in the day that Dymka was the victim of a fatal traffic accident. Weeks would pass before they found out the full horror of what transpired in those early morning hours. Santiago worked a daytime shift on Oct. 31, 2021. The son of a Newark police lieutenant, he joined the force in 2019 and quickly made a name for himself. He received special commendations for assisting in two major drug arrests in 2020. After work that Sunday, Santiago drove to a bar in his hometown of Bloomfield to watch the Dallas Cowboys game, said Toscano, his lawyer. Santiago had a few drinks but not enough to impair his driving, Toscano said. The off-duty officer left with Guzman after last call and headed to a friend’s house. It’s rare for people to be walking at any time along the Garden State Parkway, a major highway that runs the length of New Jersey, but especially so in the predawn hours. How Dymka ended up there remains a mystery to his loved ones. After allegedly striking Dymka, Santiago drove off but returned to the scene multiple times before he loaded the man’s body into his car, prosecutors said. With Guzman in the passenger seat and Dymka’s body in the back, Santiago then drove to the home he shares with his parents, prosecutors said. According to an affidavit of probable cause signed by a state trooper, Guzman informed Santiago’s mother that her son had struck a man while driving drunk and the body was in the Honda. She went to speak with Santiago and then walked over to the car to see the body, the affidavit says. That’s when she allegedly instructed him to return the dead man to the crash scene, the affidavit says. Santiago’s father called 911 though prosecutors did not detail when this occurred. Santiago got angry after finding out that his father had contacted police, according to the affidavit, and discussed changing his clothes. “My f------ shirt has blood on it,” Santiago said, according to the police affidavit. Before he took off, his mother handed him a towel so he could clean the blood off himself, the affidavit says. Santiago arrived back at the accident site just before New Jersey State troopers showed up. The troopers found Santiago standing beside his car and Dymka’s body in the back seat, according to the affidavit. Santiago described what happened and admitted to hitting the victim with his car, police said in the affidavit filed in Bloomfield Municipal Court. He appeared intoxicated and was taken for blood testing, the affidavit says. But Santiago, despite appearing drunk and having admitted to moving a dead body, was not arrested at the scene. He was not charged until more than three weeks later. Policing experts said it was curious that the troopers did not give Santiago a breathalyzer test on the scene. Had they done so, and had Santiago failed, he may have been arrested on the spot. “If they have no good explanation, like the breathalyzer did not work, or they didn’t have it for whatever reason, then the only explanation that comes to my mind is that they engaged in what we refer to as ‘professional courtesy,’” said Nancy Haberfeld, a professor of police science at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City. She described that as “wrong, unethical and quite possibly in direct violation of their departmental SOPs,” or standard operating procedures. A New Jersey State Police spokesman referred questions to the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office. A spokeswoman for the prosecutor’s office, Katherine Carter, said it was a state police matter. Toscano, Santiago’s lawyer, said the narrative released by prosecutors misconstrues Santiago’s actions that day. “This is not a cover-up. There was no attempted cover-up,” Toscano said. “It was a horrible, horrible accident, but there was not one iota of cover-up here at all.” After realizing he had hit a person, the off-duty officer called his father from the scene, Toscano told NBC News, and the elder Santiago immediately called New Jersey State Police. Santiago put the victim in the back seat with the intention of driving him to the nearest hospital, Toscano said. But then he realized that the man was dead, Toscano said. Santiago drove home with the body not to cover up the crime, Toscano said, but to speak with his father about what to do next. The lawyer couldn’t say why Santiago didn’t just call his father again. “His words to me were, ‘I panicked. I didn’t know what to do,’” Toscano said. Santiago’s father had already left for the accident scene by the time the son returned home, Toscano said. The father had contacted his son’s boss, Newark Chief of Police Lee Douglas, who also showed up at the crash site, Toscano said. Dymka, who was born in Poland and grew up in Garfield, N.J., was pronounced dead at the scene at 5:27 a.m., roughly two and a half hours after he was hit. The cause of death was blunt force trauma, according to the spokeswoman for the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office. No actual time of death was released, and the state medical examiner’s office did not respond to requests for comment. Louis Santiago was indicted on 12 felony offenses: reckless vehicular homicide, strict liability vehicular homicide, leaving the scene of a fatal crash, endangering an injured victim, desecrating/moving human remains, conspiracy to desecrate human remains, hindering one’s own apprehension, conspiracy to hinder prosecution, tampering with physical evidence, obstructing the administration of law and two counts of official misconduct. He was also hit with nine non-indictable offenses, including DWI and illegal window tinting, according to the prosecutor’s office. He has pleaded not guilty. His blood alcohol results have not been released. The Newark Police Department suspended Santiago, his lawyer said. A department spokesperson declined to comment. Toscano, a former first assistant prosecutor in the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office, said he was shocked by the number of charges leveled against his client. “Maybe there was probable cause to charge two or three offenses, but to charge a law enforcement officer with 12 or 13 was blatant and intentional overkill,” Toscano said. Toscano added that Dymka’s death is weighing heavily on the young police officer and the rest of his family. “These are good people,” Toscano said, before referring specifically to Santiago. “He speaks about the victim all the time. He speaks about the victim more than the charges against him.” Annette Santiago, 53, was charged with conspiracy to desecrate human remains, hindering apprehension, and conspiracy to hinder apprehension and tamper with physical evidence. She pleaded not guilty. Her lawyer, Vincent Scoca, declined to comment. Guzman, 25, was charged with the same offenses. He pleaded not guilty, and his lawyer, Dennis Carletta, did not respond to requests for comment. Dymka had spent much of the night at a Halloween party at Club Feathers in River Edge, New Jersey’s oldest gay nightclub, where he was a regular. “We all loved him,” said owner Paul Binetti. “He was always funny and bubbly and energetic. If you needed a laugh, you’d go to him.” Binetti said Dymka showed up with a group of friends in costume around 9 p.m. Over the next few hours, he drank and danced inside but spent much of the night chatting with people on the wooden wall outside the club, Binetti said. Dymka was buzzed but not wasted when he left around 1 a.m., Binetti said. He hopped into an Uber with a friend but accidentally left his phone behind. “He gave everybody a hug and a kiss like he did every night, and got in his Uber,” Binetti said. “That was the last time we saw him.” Binetti said he was stunned and horrified when he found out late the next day that Dymka had been killed. “Accidents happen. That was not an accident what he did afterwards,” Binetti said, referring to Louis Santiago. “Whatever this cop did, whoever was involved with him, needs to pay for their actions.” Dymka’s parents were still too grief-stricken to speak about the tragedy, according to Ochoa, his boyfriend. Ochoa said Dymka went to the friend's house in Bloomfield, but the friend, who was drinking that night, wasn't clear on the circumstances of Dymka leaving or how he ended up walking along the Garden State Parkway at 3 a.m. ""I just have no idea,"" he said. For Ochoa, it has been impossible to make sense of what happened to his boyfriend — a talented artist, a cat lover, and above all a caring soul. “I don’t understand how this could happen to anyone, and I specifically don’t understand how it could happen to somebody like Damian,” Ochoa said. “He would run into a building on fire if there was someone he loved in it. He was just that person.”",U.S./NBC News,'Incredibly selfish': Friends of slain N.J. nurse appalled by cop's actions after crash,https://news.yahoo.com/cop-fatally-struck-nurse-actions-120208631.html
1/23/2022,"A United Airlines flight to Tel Aviv turned back to New York due to two disruptive passengers. The passengers refused to provide proof of allocated seats in business class, per Israeli media. They ""started a riot"" about 90 minutes into the flight, according to an eyewitness account. A United Airlines flight to Tel Aviv, Israel, turned back to New York mid-flight on Friday after two passengers caused a ""riot"" on the aircraft, per reports. The passengers, both Israeli, seated themselves in business class seats on the half-empty flight, according to Israeli media. United Airlines told Insider that 123 out of a maximum of 330 passengers were on board the Boeing 787-10. When flight attendants asked the Israeli passengers for proof that they were sitting in their assigned seats, The Jerusalem Post reported that they refused to show their tickets. Roi Lotan, who was on United flight 90, told Israeli broadcaster News 12 that the passengers became disruptive and ""a riot started"" about an hour and a half into the flight. The pilot then turned back to Newark Liberty International Airport, Lotan said. FlightAware's flight tracking website shows that the flight was diverted near the US-Canada border between Maine and New Brunswick. FlightAware shows that passengers were disembarked from the plane in New York almost three hours after they initially departed for Israel. United Airlines provided passengers with meal vouchers, hotels, and alternative flights to Tel Aviv, per Israeli media outlet Arutz Sheva. United told Insider in a statement that the flight returned to New York due to ""disruptive passengers on board."" Law enforcement officers met the aircraft after landing, the statement said. The flight was subsequently canceled. No charges were issued against the disruptive passengers, according to the Port Authority Police Department, per CNN. On Wednesday, Insider reported that an American Airlines passenger who refused to wear her face mask forced a flight to London from Miami to divert back to Florida roughly an hour into the 4,400-mile journey.
