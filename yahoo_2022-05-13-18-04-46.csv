5/13/2022,"Markets have well and truly changed direction from last year’s bullish trends. The downward shift has brought us a major selloff, and declines of 27% and more in the tech-heavy NASDAQ index. For investors, it’s a situation that requires a close watch on the markets, and clear eye for the opportunities that will pop out as conditions change. It’s also a situation in which investors can use expert advice. Jim Cramer, the well-known host of CNBC’s ‘Mad Money’ program, tells investors that when the market starts to change direction, in response to shifting trends or increased volatility, it’s also time to change strategies. And in the current clime, Cramer is recommending profitable stocks in the tech sector – especially those that are beaten-down. Describing his stance, Cramer says, ""Many tech companies that make real things and return capital to shareholders now do sell at reasonable prices after the tsunami of selling... Right now the facts are a lot less hostile to the beaten-down high-flyers..."" With this in mind, we’ve used the TipRanks database to pinpoint two heavily discounted tech stocks that return capital regularly through dividends. Each is a Strong Buy, according to the analyst community, and has a strong upside potential for the coming year. Let's take a closer look. Absolute Software (ABST) First up is Absolute Software, a leader in enterprise resilience, or maintaining normal operations, along with the ability to recover systems and data, against network security breaches. The Canadian-based company's product lines offer customers the ability to manage, control, and heal devices, networks, data, and operations, shortening recovery times and speeding up the return to normalcy. In addition, Absolute offers IT and security solutions to protect systems and prevent breaches from occurring. Absolute boasts over 13,000 global customers, including 28 OEMs who factory-embed Absolute products into devices. The company also has 140 patents to protect its intellectual property. More importantly, however, the move toward remote work in the last two years has put a high premium on networking and network security – a move that has benefited Absolute. The company’s revenues started taking off in the past year, and in the most recent quarter, Q3 of fiscal year 2022 (the quarter ending March 31), the company reported $52 million at the top line, up 69% year-over-year. The high revenue was supported by an 18% acceleration in annual recurring revenue, which broke above $200 million in the quarter. Quarterly cash from operations grew by $7.3 million to reach a company record of $17 million. Also of note to investors, the company declared a dividend of 8 cents Canadian per common share for the quarter. At a rate of 6 cents US, the dividend annualizes to 24 cents and gives a yield of 3.3%. Absolute has maintained its dividend for the past 9 years. Despite these positive drivers, Absolute’s shares are down 51% over the past 12 months. That has not, however, dissuaded Canaccord's 5-star analyst Michael Walkley from take a bullish view of the stock. “We believe Absolute has a unique technology moat – an embedded software in the firmware of 500M+ PCs by OEM partners – and the ability to drive towards 20%+ long-term growth in a large and growing TAM, while maintaining its rule of 40 metrics. Further, enterprise / government computers typically run an average of 10+ security apps, which Absolute’s resilience offering can ensure are correctly installed and working properly... management is executing well and the share price represents a very attractive entry point. We believe patient long-term investors are likely to be rewarded,"" Walkley opined. These bullish comments support Walkley’s Buy rating on ABST shares, and his $17 price target implies an upside of ~134% for the coming year. (To watch Walkley’s track record, click here) Walkley may be particularly bullish here, but he is not the only analyst positive on Absolute Software. The stock’s 4 recent reviews break down to 3 Buys and 1 Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus view, and the $13.56 average price target suggests an 87% one-year upside from the current trading price of $7.25. (See ABST stock forecast on TipRanks) National Instruments (NATI) Now we’ll turn to National Instruments, a Texas-based company that offers a wide range of tech products, including automated test equipment and virtual instrumentation software. The company’s products give solutions for a series of tech-related issues, including prototype design and validation, and factory device testing. National Instrument’s product line has found applications as varied as semiconductors and electronics to transportation to aerospace and defense. National Instruments has been making strong moves to expand its footprint in recent months. This past March, the company completed its purchase, for an undisclosed amount, of the Electronic Vehicle segment of the German firm Heinzinger GmbH. Heinzinger is a leader in Europe’s high-current and high-voltage power systems. The transaction was funded through a combination of cash and credit. In another acquisition, this May, National Instruments closed its transaction with Kratzer Automation AG. Kratzer provides customer solutions in the EV market, and this acquisition further expands NI’s footprint in the EV market, a growing segment in modern manufacturing. In the first quarter of the year, NI reported 1Q22 revenue of $385 million, an increase of 15% year-over-year, but below the $402 million estimates. Product orders were up in the quarter, increasing by 27% over the year-ago period. The company reported positive non-GAAP diluted earnings of 41 cents per share, just missing the 43-cent forecast – but increasing 28% from the same metric in 1Q21. NI ended the first quarter with $143 million in cash on hand. This was more than enough to support a dividend of 28 cents per common share. At current share pricing, this dividend yields 3.5%. Even though this stock is feeling pressure right now (down 25% year-to-date), Morgan Stanley's Meta Marshall remains optimistic. The analyst writes, “While we acknowledge a relatively disappointing Q1 result for NATI on greater than expected supply chain challenges / Russia exposure, we view dip as a buying opportunity for the name given operating leverage potential and growing exposures to key megatrends. We remain cognizant that achievement of price target will require NATI to move past supply chain issues and investors gaining greater confidence in ability to measure impact, but think lead times remain competitive (7-8 weeks vs. competitors at 14-16 weeks for some areas)” In line with this bullish outlook, Marshall rates NATI shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), with a $44 price target that indicates room for 39% growth in the next 12 months. (To watch Marshall’s track record, click here) Once again, we’re looking at a stock with 4 recent stock reviews, including 3 Buys against 1 Hold, and a Strong Buy consensus rating. NATI is trading for $31.65 and its $46.50 average target suggests ~47% upside from that level.

5/13/2022,"The S&P 500 is down 16% so far in 2022. While investor sentiment is far from bullish these days, Goldman Sachs sees opportunity in one specific group of companies: those that return cash to investors on a regular basis. “We continue to recommend investors own stocks with high dividend yield and growth,” Goldman’s chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin writes in a note to clients. Kostin says strong corporate earnings growth means companies can hike their payouts going forward. And better yet, the market has not priced in that potential. “The futures market is expecting S&P 500 dividend growth to be negative in 2023 and 2024,” Kostin says. “Looking ahead, our forecast implies 6.7% CAGR dividend growth over the next ten years, significantly above market pricing of 0.4%.” Kostin’s team has identified several companies that fit this investment theme. Here’s a look at three of them. *Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms. Gilead Sciences is already one of the more generous dividend-payers from the healthcare sector, currently offering an annual dividend yield of 4.8%. But Goldman sees bigger payouts on the horizon. The financial juggernaut predicts that by 2023, Gilead’s dividend per share divided by its current price will lead to a yield of 5%. There’s good reason to be optimistic about this biopharmaceutical company. In Q1, Gilead’s revenue grew 3% year over year to $6.6 billion while adjusted earnings per share increased 4% to $2.12. It also has a solid cash position of almost $7 billion as of Mar. 31. Gilead started paying dividends in 2015 with a quarterly payout of 43 cents per share. Today, the company pays 73 cents per share — so the amount has grown by almost 70%. The past few years haven’t been kind to brick-and-mortar stores. So who would have guessed that electronics retailer Best Buy — with more than 1,000 stores in the U.S. and Canada — would be able to deliver the dividend growth that it has of late? In 2021, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 27% to 70 cents per share. Earlier this year, management announced another 26% quarterly payout increase to 88 cents per share. While many retailers are still struggling, Best Buy has found its momentum. In the fiscal year ended Jan. 29, the company delivered record revenue and profitability, highlighted by 10.4% same-store sales growth. The stock currently yields 4.1%. Goldman sees Best Buy continuing its dividend growth streak and offering a yield (based on the current price) of 4.3% in 2023. With oil and gas prices shooting through the roof, energy stocks have become some of the healthiest dividend payers in the market. Devon Energy, for instance, recently hiked its quarterly payout by 27% to a record high of $1.27 per share, giving the stock a mouth-watering annual yield of 7.6%. The board also increased the company’s share repurchase authorization by 25% to $2 billion. In Q1, Devon generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow for the quarter, marking an 18% increase year over year. Goldman expects prosperity to persist for the oil and gas producer, projecting a dividend yield of 7.8% in 2023 based on the current stock price. That said, it’s important to note that Devon’s dividend consists of a fixed quarterly payout and a variable dividend that includes up to 50% of excess free cash flow.

5/13/2022,"Warren Buffett’s long-term outlook on investments has proven successful over the years, with Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) outperforming the S&P 500 in total returns by about 84% over the past 20 years. If there’s one thing that’s made Buffett one of the most successful investors in history, it’s his commitment to his strategy. While several new investment techniques and algorithms have come and gone over the years, Buffett has maintained his fairly simple strategy of picking solid companies and focusing on long-term growth while somehow ignoring the noise that has most investors constantly second-guessing themselves. It may seem odd that somebody with such a disciplined long-term approach to investing has no interest in purchasing real estate, especially since it's what vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Charles Munger used to build his fortune. Buying Real Estate vs Investing in Real Estate Buffett isn’t against investing in real estate. In fact, he has invested in several real estate investment trusts (REITs) over the years. However, he knows it makes little sense for him to get into the business of being a landlord. Buying and managing real estate is more of a business than it is an investment, and Buffett knows that his time is better spent choosing companies to invest in than it is running a real estate business. Real estate is a tough business. For most people, it requires scaling the business to comprise several properties in order to build massive wealth. Many individual investors get into real estate with the idea that it’s going to be a passive investment, and most of these individuals eventually exit the properties once realizing what they’ve actually gotten into. Investing in real estate is a different story. Passive real estate investments allow investors to reap the rewards of this profitable asset class without taking on the management responsibilities. The FTSE Nareit All Equity REITs index has outperformed the S&P 500 in total returns during 13 out of the last 20 years, producing an average total annual return of 13.1% versus 11.1% for the S&P 500. Many investors that have turned to the private markets for passive real estate investments have averaged even greater returns. For instance, the real estate crowdfunding platform RealtyMogul has produced an average internal rate of return (IRR) of 17.2% for investors on its fully realized deals since inception. Related: Real Estate Crowdfunding Returns Compared Passive investors have options to buy shares of short-term real estate loans, make equity investments in cash-flowing multifamily properties, help fund large-scale developments or simply invest in a managed fund. While the potential profit may not be as high as buying or developing real estate, the likelihood of long-term success is much higher for most investors. The returns realized through owning real estate are a direct result of the time, energy and money that goes into it. While that business has been the source of many great fortunes over the years, it’s just simply not a business that makes sense for most people.
