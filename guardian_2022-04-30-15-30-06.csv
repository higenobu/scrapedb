4/30/2022,"Drought-afflicted areas of Ethiopia are seeing “dramatic” increases in child marriage as the worst climate-induced emergency for 40 years pushes people to the brink, the head of Unicef has said. Three consecutive failed rainy seasons have brought hunger, malnutrition and mass displacement to millions of people in the Horn of Africa, including parts of Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya and Djibouti. Many girls in Ethiopia now face being married at a young age as their parents seek to find extra resources through dowries from the husband’s family, and hope their daughters will be fed and protected by wealthier families, warned Catherine Russell, Unicef’s executive director. Some areas of the vast Oromia region have seen steep increases in the practice, the UN children’s agency said, citing local government data. In the East Hararghe zone, home to 2.7 million people, child marriage cases increased by 51%, from 70 recorded during a six-month period in 2020-21 to 106 in the same period a year later. It was just one of six drought-affected areas in Oromia to have seen a sharp rise in child marriages, Unicef said. Across those zones, cases have almost quadrupled. According to data received by Unicef this week, 672 cases of child marriage were recorded between February and August last year, whereas in the six months from last September to March this year, that number leapt to 2,282, local government figures showed. “We’re seeing increases in child marriage that are quite dramatic,” Russell said, noting that more than 600,000 children are thought to have dropped out of school as a result of the drought. She added that when girls were not in education and were forced to leave their homes, the risks of gender-based violence and of child marriage almost always increased. “These people [have their daughters married] because they’re desperate for one reason or another: they’re afraid of violence; they’re afraid for the safety of the girls; they need resources; they can’t afford to feed them,” Russell said. The impact was “debilitating” for the girls in the long term, she added. “It really cuts off all of their opportunities and ends up in a situation where they are more likely to start having children early; they are more likely to have children closer together; they’re young, so they’re not in a position to negotiate safe sex with their partners. It’s just one problem after another for these girls.” The drought threatens to set Ethiopia back in its attempts to lower its levels of child marriage, which are among the highest in the world. According to demographic data from 2016, 40% of girls in the east African country are married before the age of 18 and 14% are married before their 15th birthday. Russell, who this week visited drought-hit areas, said she had discussed the issue with the country’s president, Sahle-Work Zewde, who said it was a priority area for her. The drought is also pushing up the rates of severe acute malnutrition in the affected areas, with admission rates for children under five years old 15% higher in February this year than February last year. Russell, who visited sites where Unicef is treating malnourished children, said people were also being forced to drink contaminated water, putting them at risk of various diseases including cholera. “We haven’t seen it yet,” she said, “but everyone’s very worried about cholera.” As a result of lagging vaccination rates, measles has already made a return, with more than 1,000 cases in the Somali region of Ethiopia and 16 confirmed deaths. Like many in the humanitarian community, Russell said she was concerned that the huge global focus on Ukraine was sucking attention – and vital funds – away from other conflicts and crises around the world. “I’ve been to that region, and I know how difficult it is there. I don’t begrudge anybody in Ukraine the coverage, because they need resources as well, but I think the international community’s not great at doing two things at once,” she said. Unicef’s emergency drought appeal for the Horn of Africa had so far raised about 20% of its $250m (£200m) target, she added. While welcoming the UK government’s £17m pledge, made in January and targeting the same region, she said it was “not close to enough”.",News/Society,"Ethiopian drought leading to ‘dramatic’ increase in child marriage, Unicef warns",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/30/ethiopian-drought-leading-to-dramatic-increase-in-child-marriage-unicef-warns
4/30/2022,"Britons should take extra care booking their summer getaway as new figures show an increase in online holiday scams, with travellers being cheated out of thousands of pounds by fake flight and hotel adverts. The number of scams linked to holidays was up by a third in the year to March 2022. Within that, fraud relating to flight bookings was 13% higher than in 2021, with victims, on average, losing £3,000, based on cases being reported to Lloyds Bank. There was an even bigger rise in the number of scams linked to hotels, up 18%, with consumers typically losing £1,200. Fraud linked to package holidays was also up by a similar amount, with the average loss put at £2,300. By far the biggest increase came from scams linked to caravan stays, with the number of cases more than doubling. However, the average amount lost in each case was much lower at £374. The rise in holiday booking fraud is the latest development in what has been described as a national “fraud epidemic”. The end of Covid travel rules has resulted in a dash to book holidays but Liz Ziegler, Lloyds Banking Group’s fraud prevention director, said consumers should “not let their guard down. If it looks too good to be true, it almost certainly is.” Many of the scams started with fake ads on search engines or social media, with victims clicking on a link that appeared to take them to a genuine site. Fraudsters also lurked on real accommodation listing sites before convincing victims to transfer cash directly rather than via the platform. Other tactics include sending offers by email or text, pretending to be from a real company, the report said. “Scammers are ready to cash in on any last-minute surge in bookings,” Ziegler said. “Book directly with trusted sites or travel agents, avoid following links on social media, and always pay by card for the greatest protection.” Travellers are advised to seek out holiday firms that offer Abta or Atol protection. Lloyds said the safest way to pay for a holiday was with a debit or credit card. If a site or company wants you to pay another way, such as direct to a bank account or by wire transfer, it could be a scam, and it will be harder for you to get your money back.",Lifestyle/Money,Holiday scams soar as Britons rush to book summer getaway,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/30/holiday-scams-soar-as-britons-rush-to-book-summer-getaway
4/30/2022,"America’s tribes frequently clash but they rarely intersect. Over the past 60 years, the Democratic party has morphed into an upstairs-downstairs coalition, graduate-degree holders tethered to an urban core and religious “nones”. Meanwhile, Republicans have grown more rural, southern, evangelical and working class. Within the GOP, Donald Trump has supplanted the legacies of Ronald Reagan and Abraham Lincoln. According to Matthew Continetti, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, being a conservative in 2022 is less about advocating limited government and more about culture wars, owning the libs and denouncing globalization. Subtitled The Hundred-Year War for American Conservatism, Continetti’s third book examines a century of intellectual and political battles. He seeks to explain how Trumpism became the dominant force within the Republican party. In large measure, he succeeds. The Right is readable and relatable, well-written and engaging. The author’s command of facts is impressive. For decades, he has lived around and within the conservative ecosystem. Continetti chronicles the tumult of 1960s, the emergence of Richard Nixon’s “southern strategy” and the migration of blue-collar ethnic Catholics to what was once the home of the white Protestant establishment. He also looks back, at the pre-New Deal Republican party and at conservatism after the civil war. Continetti is sensitive to the currents that swirl in and around this country and its people. He laments that in the 21st century blood, soil and grievance have overtaken the conservative orthodoxies of free markets, personal autonomy and communal virtue. He is discomforted by how contemporary conservatism acquired a performative edge. On the page, his dismay is muted but present. He wistfully recalls the collapse of the Weekly Standard, where he worked for Bill Kristol, his future father-in-law. George W Bush’s war in Iraq was one thing that helped do-in the magazine. Similarly, the Republican establishment’s call for immigration reform left many Americans feeling unwanted and threatened. The US immigrant population hovers near a record high, almost 14%. More than 44 million people living here were born elsewhere. Even before the pandemic, the fertility rate hit a record low. The populist impulse is not going to disappear. Trump’s inaugural address, replete with images of “American carnage”, is illustrative of the new conservative normal. Continetti quotes George W Bush: “That was some weird shit.” Nonetheless, on 20 January 2017, Trump struck a nerve. Continetti is mindful of broader trends, and the havoc assortative marriage has brought to society and politics. On that point, he gives Charles Murray his due. Continetti is pessimistic. Marriage predicated upon educational attainment has helped concentrate intellectual capital and financial advantage within a narrow caste. Twenty years ago, David Brooks, once Continetti’s colleague, described an idyllic urban existence, Bobos in Paradise. Those who can’t get in, however, face life in purgatory. The meritocracy got what it clamored for, only to discover it wasn’t loved by those it left behind. Continetti seemingly attempts to downplay similarities between Trump’s Maga movement and the hard-right in Europe. He omits all reference to Nigel Farage in Britain and Marine le Pen in France. Farage led Britain to Brexit and made a cameo appearance in Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the US. Le Pen twice forced Emmanuel Macron into a run-off for president. On the other hand, Continetti does capture how part of the US right adores Vladimir Putin: his authoritarianism, his unbridled nationalism, his disdain for classic liberalism. “Putin held the same allure for the national populist right that Che Guevara held for the cold war left,” Continetti writes. “No wonder President Trump was a fan of the Russian autocrat.” Continetti also says conservatism “anchored to Trump the man will face insurmountable obstacles in attaining policy coherence, government competence, and intellectual credibility”. Here, he stands on shaky ground. In 2016, Trump assembled a winning coalition and beat Hillary Clinton. In power, he loaded the federal judiciary. Whether Jeb Bush could have replicated such success is doubtful. As for intellectual credibility, in 2008 Kristol, Continetti’s mentor, helped pluck Sarah Palin from obscurity. And we all know where that led. In 2009, Continetti himself wrote The Persecution of Sarah Palin: How the Elite Media Tried to Bring Down a Rising Star. He now says “attacks on Palin” caused him “to rally to her defense”. Intellectual slumming, more like it. Palin was unfit for the top job. She resigned as Alaska governor 18 months before her term expired. Continetti also argues that conservatism needs once again to embrace the Declaration of Independence, the constitution and the Bill of Rights. “One cannot be an American patriot without reverence for the nation’s enabling documents,” he says. January 6 demonstrates otherwise. Conservatism’s commitment to democracy and the constitution appears situational. Members of the conservative establishment provided intellectual sinew for America’s Caesar. It wasn’t just about Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert and folks dressed as Vikings. John Eastman, a former clerk to Clarence Thomas; Ted Cruz, a former clerk to Chief Justice William Rehnquist; Mike Lee, son of Rex Lee, Ronald Reagan’s solicitor general. Together with Ginni Thomas, the justice’s wife, they played outsized roles around the Capitol attack. Fifteen months later, Eastman is in legal jeopardy, Cruz is under growing suspicion and Lee looks like a weasel. Ms Thomas merits our scorn. The reckoning Continetti hopes for may never arrive. Gas prices surge. Crime rises. Together, they portend a Republican midterm landslide. Such realities ushered in Reagan’s 1980 landslide over Jimmy Carter. A one-term Biden presidency looms. A second Trump term is a real possibility. The latest revelations surrounding Kevin McCarthy and Mitch McConnell teach us that inconvenient truths are quickly discarded. In politics, a win is a win.

Pre-Covid, we used to make huge pyramids of it and put them in the centre of the table for children to serve themselves, but it’s still an excellent dish to serve from the service counter. As for the stock, we use miso because it’s a great source of umami, which is the fifth taste element (the other four are salty, sweet, bitter and sour).

4/30/2022,"Single-parent households are among the most exposed to the cost of living crisis, with a savings pot 20 times smaller than the UK average, analysis shows. The analysis by Labour, using Office for National Statistics figures depicting wealth in Great Britain, shows that single parents with dependent children had £400 in savings between April 2018 and March 2020, compared with all households, which had £8,000. The cost of living has squeezed households across the UK, with 90% reporting an increase in their living costs affected by rising fuel and food prices. Single parents with dependent children had the lowest average net wealth of all groups, followed by single parents with non-dependent children, at £1,700. By contrast, households where the couple are both over the state pension age, and who have no children, have the highest amount of savings, at £59,600. The analysis also reveals how the financial burden caused by having a lack of savings disproportionately affects women, given that women make up 90% of single-parent families. The findings come after cabinet ministers were told to find “non-fiscal” ways to address the cost of living crisis on Monday, with Dominic Raab subsequently coming under pressure when asked about the government’s failure to introduce policies to tackle the crisis. Labour have called for an emergency budget to be brought forward, with policies which would include a windfall tax, a discount on business rates and an investigation by the National Crime Agency into taxpayer money lost through fraud. Anneliese Dodds MP, the shadow women and equalities secretary, said: “As payslips land on doormats across the country today, families are finding out just how much more the Conservatives are pinching from their pockets by hiking national insurance. “With a savings pot 20 times smaller than that of the average UK household going into the cost of living crisis, single parents will feel the pain more than most. “The Conservatives think it’s ‘silly’ to do more to help families with soaring bills. Labour is demanding an emergency budget to enact sensible, costed, practical measures to help households, including a cut in energy bills by up to £600 paid for via a windfall tax on oil and gas companies.” Victoria Benson, the chief executive of Gingerbread, a charity that supports single parent families, said having savings was a “distant dream” for many single parents. She added: “I’ve heard heartbreaking stories of mums going without food so they can feed their children and of people being pushed into poverty because, despite working as many hours as possible, they can’t cover basic living costs. “Single-parent families have very little financial flexibility and, while other families may be able to trim luxuries from their budget, single parents have to go without essentials like food and heating.” Joeli Brearley, the founder of Pregnant Then Screwed, said: “We know that single parents were disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, particularly when the schools closed and they were unable to rely on a partner to support with all the additional unpaid work. “Many were forced out of their jobs or had to take a pay cut through no fault of their own. Straight from that crisis they are now plunged into a new crisis as bills rise dramatically without warning, but the majority are already living hand to mouth. “We know that extortionate childcare costs are creating not just a cost of living crisis but a cost of working crisis, particularly for single parents. “Our recent survey with 27,000 parents found that three-quarters – 73% – of single parents say that their childcare costs the same or more than their rent or their mortgage, resulting in more than half – 53% – of single parents stating that they have to skip meals or forgo heating and fuel to pay for childcare. “At this point we have to ask ourselves what the government really means when they talk about investing in hard-working families, because single parents, who personify this, are clearly being ignored by this government.’’",News/Business,Single-parent families ‘most exposed’ to cost of living crisis in Great Britain,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/30/single-parent-families-most-exposed-to-cost-of-living-crisis-in-great-britain

4/30/2022,"Borodianka, Kyiv region – In the woods on a roadside near Borodianka, 40 miles from Kyiv, police were overseeing the exhumation of two men who were executed and buried next to what locals say was a Russian military checkpoint. Alongside the officers were four men in civilian clothing wearing gardening gloves – ordinary Ukrainians with no previous experience of this gut-wrenching work who have become volunteers collecting the hundreds of bodies still being dug up in towns bordering the capital. It has been a month since the Ukrainian army pushed Russian forces out of Kyiv region, yet local police and volunteers are still finding new graves. More than 1,000 bodies have been recovered there according to Ukrainian prosecutors, who said many more people were killed by bombs, making their remains hard to find. The police forces of small towns and quiet villages have been plunged into investigating one of the largest atrocities in Europe in recent times. Amid the unfathomable scale of this endeavour, officers are relying on ordinary Ukrainians to do the heavy lifting while they take statements and document the deaths. The volunteer body collectors are tasked with picking up rotting and often mutilated bodies from the graves, putting them in body bags, numbering them and then, at the end of each day, driving the total number of bodies collected to whichever morgue in Kyiv region has room. “I didn’t know this is what we’d be doing,” said Vasily Pasieka, a middle-aged driver for a construction company in Chernivtsi region, western Ukraine, who was driving the van which carries the bodies. “But someone has to do it for the relatives, for the police.” “I am a simple driver. I’ve been behind the wheel for 40 years,” said Pasieka. Their employer, Mekhtransbud, wanted to do something to help when they saw the news about the mass atrocities in Kyiv region. They called one of the improvised humanitarian aid centres, who said they needed a van and manpower. Pasieka and his colleague Serhiy Roholsky volunteered to go to the region with one of the company’s vans. The company, they said, was paying for their stay at a hotel while they volunteered. “We pick up between 8 to 11 bodies a day,” said Roholsky, who said they had only been working in the small town of Borodianka and its surrounding villages since they arrived two weeks ago. Roholsky had just picked up two bodies from a dug-up grave in the woods and placed them on a path with the help of two other male volunteers in their early twenties. “Every day it’s different but we find all sorts – men, women, young, old, middle-aged.” One of the two bodies was a pension-aged man whose head had been severed, the whereabouts of which is still unknown. Both corpses were twisted and mangled. It looked as though their limbs had been broken in several places. The son of the man whose head had been severed, Serhiy Kubitsky, was there to witness the exhumation and give a statement to the police. He and his family had left the village for the safety of western Ukraine when the war started, but his father had not wanted to leave. “I didn’t believe it was him when they told me,” said Kubitsky. He said that his neighbours found his father’s body in the woods near the Russian checkpoint on 17 March and buried him on the spot. The neighbours then returned to the grave yesterday to dig it up under police supervision. “Then they showed me his documents,” said Kubitsky. In the trunk of his car were the spades used by his neighbours to exhume the bodies. Every day, Pasieka and Roholsky go from their hotel to the humanitarian aid centre where their company’s van is refuelled, then they pick up two new volunteers to help them collect the bodies. Even amid the daily hell of the task, the two worst instances in the relatively small area of Kyiv region where they have been volunteering, Roholsky said, were when a 15-year-old girl was exhumed from a mass grave near the town’s GP surgery and when they dug up the body of an elderly man who had been doused in petrol and set alight. The witness who recounted the story to Roholsky was the elderly man’s wife, who said she had been tied up by Russian soldiers and forced to watch. After the two men in the woods , the next stop was the cemetery of a nearby village, where the team were to dig up two buried bodies in order to register the cause of death. Stanislav Kozynchuk, the deputy head of the Kyiv region prosecutor’s office, said the two people who had been buried in the cemetery were killed by airstrikes, which he had reason to believe may have used clusters bombs. Evidence collected by the Guardian during visits to Bucha, Hostomel and Borodianka – and reviewed by independent weapons experts – showed that Russian troops had used cluster bombs, which are widely banned across the world, as well as extremely powerful unguided bombs, which are not permitted for use in populated areas and are responsible for the destruction of several blocks of flats in Kyiv region. At the cemetery, one of the victims’ wives, Alla Kuzmenko, said that her husband had gone out to help neighbours after a bomb hit a house across the road. She started following him but turned back to put the dog in the house when a second bomb hit and killed him. “My dog likes to run between people’s legs, I didn’t want her to be running riot,” said Kuzmenko. Deputy prosecutor Kozynchuk said that all bodies not buried according to the law needed to be exhumed and examined until every cause of death was determined by a forensic doctor after an autopsy – only after that could such bodies be buried. “Because of war, there was no chance to do the autopsies, the civilians just buried the body and later reported to the police the location of the grave. It doesn’t matter whether the body was buried in a cemetery or somewhere in a field, if it wasn’t documented it has to be exhumed,’’ said Kozynchuk. “It is essential that all bodies are exhumed and identified so that victims’ families can be informed, and the exact causes of death established,” Michelle Bachelet, the UN high commissioner for human rights, has said. “All measures should be taken to preserve evidence.”",News/World news,‘Someone has to do it’: the volunteers exhuming Kyiv region’s dead,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/30/kyiv-civillians-dead-volunteers-exhuming-ukraine
4/30/2022,"Rebel Conservative MPs fear Boris Johnson could gamble on a general election within months in a make-or-break bid to save his premiership – but the party chairman, Oliver Dowden, has privately dismissed the idea as electorally disastrous. One MP hoping to oust Johnson said they are “deadly serious” in their belief that the prime minister could seek to win himself another term by calling a vote this autumn, especially if he manages to buy time in No 10 by winning a confidence vote before the summer. Some of his critics are convinced that the threshold of 54 Tory MPs required to trigger a confidence vote could be crossed shortly after further expected fines over the Partygate scandal, a bad result in next week’s local elections or the probable loss of the marginal Wakefield seat in its upcoming byelection. However, they think Johnson stands a good chance of winning a vote requiring the support of more than 50% of his MPs – giving him a year’s reprieve before he can face another. One Conservative MP said Dowden had been dampening down speculation of an early general election by privately reassuring colleagues there is “no way” they would go to the polls when Johnson’s ratings are so poor and Labour are several points ahead. But the MP also argued that if Johnson faces a serious choice between being ousted by his own party and putting himself to a vote of the general public, many believe he would choose the latter. “He could try to run another anti-establishment campaign pitching himself against MPs in parliament, that’s what we most fear,” they said. Another Tory MP, who wants Johnson to go, said there was nervousness on the backbenches, particularly among so-called red wall MPs, that Johnson’s “self-interest” and reputation as a risk-taker could lead him to bet on an election. One senior party source insisted an autumn election was “not the working assumption” and highlighted forthcoming boundary changes, which are expected to benefit the Tories and would not come into force until 2023. But they added: “One thing that is always a good idea is to try and maintain a wide range of options.” More than 6,800 seats in 200 councils across Britain are up for grabs in next week’s local elections, including every seat in London, Scotland and Wales. Both main parties are playing down their prospects, with Labour pointing to their strong showing the last time these seats were contested in 2018, and the Conservatives highlighting the fact they are trailing in national polls. Tory strategists claim they are in serious trouble in the flagship London councils of Wandsworth and Westminster. Labour insist these remain unlikely targets, but have hopes of taking Barnet, in north London, which has been mainly Tory-controlled since it was formed in 1964 (with a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition ruling between 1994 and 2002). Outside the capital, the Tories hope to make gains in places such as Stoke-on-Trent and Sandwell in the West Midlands, where they took parliamentary seats at the 2019 general election but are well behind Labour at council level. Conservative MPs will be watching developments in their constituencies closely, with advances for the opposition parties pointing to potential trouble at a future general election. A senior Tory party source played down the risk that this could translate into fresh trouble for Johnson, however, saying: “It’s well known know local elections can be used as a protest vote.” The Liberal Democrats had made modest gains in disgraced former MP Owen Paterson’s North Shropshire seat at recent local elections, before overturning a near-23,000 majority to oust the Conservatives last year. Labour sources say their number-crunchers will be monitoring the council results particularly closely in 50 key parliamentary seats the party believes it needs to gain in order to win the next election – including Stevenage, Bury North and South, and Glasgow. “If we have a night where we’re showing the right kind of progress in the sort of places where we need to win at the next election, that’s good for us,” they said, adding that Labour will also be happy if Tory MPs continue to procrastinate about Johnson’s future, given his poor personal ratings. Dowden told Conservative activists at his party’s spring conference in Blackpool that Johnson saw these local elections as the start of a two-year campaign, building up to the next general election.

4/30/2022,"Every streaming service has to have its own romantic anthology programme: this is the law. Netflix has a dozen of them. Prime has Modern Love. There’s that one where Dave Franco is always getting angry and making craft beer. They all have one-word titles, unless they have a two-word title, in which case one of those words has to be “love”. They all have a scene where, after flirting in a bar, a very good-looking couple go out to a late-night food stall and eat something while standing up. That, the streaming platforms tell us, is what love is. It’s a chewy slice of pizza, eaten laughing at 1am, while being watched as you glow gorgeously through a window. The second series of Love Life, then, which is HBO Max’s version (also available on iPlayer and Netflix, where it joins Love, Life & Everything In Between, Lovesick, Love Hard, Sex/Life and, of course, just Love), and the best of the lot. The first series took 10 episodes to explain why Anna Kendrick wasn’t married, while the second follows William Jackson Harper as he consistently says the wrong thing to the wrong person at exactly the wrong time. What Love Life does so well is make those small-to-an-outsider, huge-to-an-insider moments of a relationship look large on the screen: a “you’re being weird” chat on the subway after a long night out; a “this is my girlfriend” introduction that doesn’t feel right; forgetting you’ve connected your phone’s iMessages to your shared iPad even though you came home holding flowers. Giving 10 episodes over to one person’s half-decade or so of romantic misadventure inverts the romcom tropes in a very satisfying way: it’s less “Here’s the bad boyfriend, and here’s the love of your life. The End” and more “Here’s the person who wasn’t quite right, here’s the person you were very embarrassing in front of, here’s the person who was very embarrassing in front of you, and here’s the person you’ll marry for a bit but shouldn’t have. The … End?” While the first series was very good, it did occasionally stutter: there were slightly too many scenes where someone looks sad on a train late at night, and sometimes the Voice of God narrative track found a bit too much significance in someone in public being dressed nicely. The second series is more refined, and it helps that Harper is great. In the first episode, as you see his married Marcus tiptoe around having an overwhelming crush on another woman, you experience every illicit half-betrayal he commits: the too-friendly-too-often text messaging, the showing her Instagram account to his friend to try to impress him, the bit where he talks himself into having marriage trouble and that this is his only way out. At every turn, the show resists the urge to have a character shout: “Ugh … I’m just so sick of apps!” before meeting their soulmate in a coffee shop literally seconds later. There are some convenient friendship overlaps, but never a corny “So how did you two meet?” “Oh, I bumped into her while she was holding a load of smoothies.” This is what happens when you give a romcom storyline the years it needs to breathe. What do we, the viewer, get out of this? There must be a voracious demand for these shows: that’s why there are so many of them, right? My theory isn’t complicated, but still: we just like watching good-looking actors with good chemistry fall in love a bit. The current trend for anthology series gets to take that a bit further – here are some good-looking people with good chemistry falling in love a bit, sure, but also here’s the same good-looking actor sitting at a bus stop crying because they can’t figure out what to type in a text. This won’t be the last of them. There is always another Quibi, another Peacock TV, another BritBox round the corner; all of them, legally, need their anthology series. But for now, Love Life is the best example of how love on screen can be interesting and not saccharine, a densely textured antidote to Bridgerton’s cartoonishly breathless romance. Sometimes, searching for love is just about some guy wearing a very brave hat in a bar before going home alone and sending a risky DM. Every streaming platform is determined to remind us of this.",Arts/Television & radio,Love Life: TV’s best ever depiction of romance,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/30/love-life-william-jackson-harper-tvs-best-ever-depiction-of-romance

4/30/2022,"You might think that unfeasibly high, pumped-up platform boots by the London-based brand Naked Wolfe would only enjoy niche appeal. At first glance, they look more at home with Camden’s cybergoths or Catwoman wannabes than the mainstream. On Wednesday it was revealed that the six-inch “Spice” platforms are officially the hottest item in the world, according to fashion shopping app Lyst. Each quarter, Lyst releases a “heat” index, ranking the fashion products that have generated the most sales, searches and views within its app, as well as social media engagement worldwide. So how does a £300 Y2K-style Glam Rock boot that isn’t exactly suitable for the school run or office drinks hit the hotspot? The answer may be TikTok. The video-sharing platform has “levelled the playing field”, said Katy Lubin, Lyst’s VP of Brand and Communications. “What we’ve seen is lots of smaller niche brands entering the conversation. The fashion industry has always had a gatekeeper community,” Lubin said, recalling the iconic ‘cerulean’ scene in The Devil Wears Prada. In an acerbic monologue, editor-in-chief Miranda Priestly – a withering Meryl Streep – explains the traditional trend trajectory to her fashion-refusenik assistant, played by Anne Hathaway. The colour of her “lumpy, loose sweater … was selected for you by the people in this room”, Priestly says. Trends, she explains, are decreed by one small circle of fashion editors, and the rest of us are powerless to resist. That was until TikTok changed the game. “That linear trajectory has been upended,” said Lubin. “Having this platform where people are free to post their own style has given different voices more sway with what becomes popular – the cycle has never been so unpredictable.” The new fashion trajectory starts with a hashtagged TikTok video (#nakedwolfe has had 113.6m views). Then the “power of community” takes over, explained Cassandra Russell, TikTok’s head of fashion. “Before you know it, you have an army of fashionistas reviewing your product, and it just catches fire.” In the case of platform boots, it helps that the shoes have been worn by a number of fashion-forward celebrities. During Paris Fashion Week last month, model Hailey Bieber teamed a pair of chunky black boots with a pink silky knee-length dress. In February Kourtney Kardashian posed in a pair of the boots and a strapless bodysuit from sister Kim’s shapewear line Skims. Spanish singer Rosalía has also been pictured in platforms. Naked Wolfe co-founder Bronte Mance credits the pandemic for driving the success of the brand’s platform boots. “Consumers started to broaden their horizons and it gave brands like ours the opportunity to showcase our designs without having to have a traditional runway,” she said. At one point, they were selling over 5,000 pairs a week. “I searched the Naked Wolfe hashtag and we had 1 million views, two weeks later we were at over 100 million,” Mance added. It’s worth noting, said Lubin, that “not all of these trends translate into sales”. That’s a good thing, she added, “considering fashion’s relentless pace and the need for more conscious consumption. A lot of the fashion moments going viral on TikTok are more about dressing up and having fun than buying new stuff”. Many Gen Z shoppers, comprising 60% of TikTok users, are also unable to afford new designer clothing. With its ability to publish instantly, combined with its global reach (the hashtag #fashion has had 141.1 billlon views), could TikTok be the new glossy fashion magazine for Gen Z? “It’s definitely less rule-bound than the glossies,” said Russell, “and more accessible for younger audiences. By creating their own content, the community keeps it fresh in a way that other platforms can’t.”",News/Technology,Platform for success: how TikTok has made one shoe brand the hottest on the planet,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/30/platform-for-success-how-tiktok-has-made-one-shoe-brand-the-hottest-on-the-planet
4/30/2022,"Outside a Dollar Tree in Detroit, Latasha Holmes lamented the rising cost of toilet paper, beverages, food and other items she had just purchased. The price increases, she said, were forcing her to choose among necessities for her and four kids. “What am I going to do? Prices are up everywhere, all over town,” she said. “I can’t afford everything.” But while Holmes struggles, Dollar Tree thrives. The retailer increased its prices by 25% as profits jumped 269% between 2019 and 2021, and its profit margins widened. Shareholders won too. The company also announced a stock buyback program worth $1bn that will deliver cash from those price increases to its investors. Dollar Tree and other large corporations are juicing profits by passing on higher-than-needed price increases to customers like Holmes under the cover of inflation, war and supply chain squeezes, consumer advocates and economists say. They are calling for the federal government to take bold steps to rein in the companies. Among proposed prescriptions are price controls, improved price fixing rules, commodity market intervention, stock buyback regulation and antitrust enforcement. Ranged against those proposals are a powerful business lobby and a divided Congress that seems unable to pass major legislation. “There are reasons to have a profit incentive, but there are also reasons to have an overall regulatory body that can say, ‘This is actually profiteering … while everyone is hurting,’” said Krista Brown, a policy analyst with the American Economic Liberties Project. A Guardian analysis of 100 top corporations’ Securities Exchange Commission filings found a median increase of 49% in profits between the most recent quarter and the same quarter two years ago, pre-pandemic. It shows companies have largely shielded themselves from inflationary pain by passing most or all of their increased costs on to customers via price hikes. So far, the federal government’s most visible attempt to address inflation has been to increase interest rates, rates look set to rise again this week. But the Guardian’s data suggests such a measure may miss an important mark. Raising rates effectively takes money out of consumers’ pockets to cool the economy. If corporate profits are contributing in a meaningful way, then raising rates would only reduce the amount of money people have to spend on products and services for which prices are still going up. “That would mean you’re exacerbating this dynamic instead of doing anything to help it,” said Isabella Weber, University of Massachusetts Amherst economist. Instead, limited and targeted price controls could work for essentials like bread, she said, but stressed those would have to be coupled with a bailout plan for negatively affected companies. “Increased prices for basic items like bread can exert enormous pressure on wages” and send inflationary ripples throughout the economy, Weber added. Though price controls are controversial and generally regarded as a leftist idea, the last president to enact them was Richard Nixon, who imposed a 90-day freeze on wages and prices to address inflation in 1970. Price controls were also enacted during and following the second world war, when, again, supply chain issues and pent up demand led to soaring prices. But price rises are not the only issue critics would like to see the Biden administration address. Others, like Groundwork Collective’s executive director, Lindsay Owens, have called for a ban or new restrictions on stock buyback programs. Joe Biden’s 2023 budget proposes prohibiting executives from selling their stock three to five years after enacting a buyback program. “The other big winner besides the shareholders in excess cash that’s going to buybacks are the executives,” Owens said. “They announce the buybacks, their stock prices soar, then they sell their shares and there are a number of ways to make this work better.” The Guardian’s analysis found companies’ buyback programs over the last 15 months totaled $544bn. That cash could have been reinvested to keep prices down, or increase workers’ wages, consumer advocates say. Others levelled accusations of price fixing and gouging. The American Economic Liberties Project is helping draft legislation that would make it easier for businesses to sue companies for price fixing by making private corporate communications more accessible. As of now, only 3% of price fixing cases make it to trial, Brown said. “Reinvigorating price fixing laws and going after price gouging in moments like this, where a war or Covid are used as excuses for companies to raise rates just because they can, could help a lot,” she added. Fixing is especially a problem in highly consolidated industries, consumer advocates say. Companies have benefited from “decades long under-enforcement of consolidation laws”, added Martin Schmalz, an Oxford University economist. Just four companies control most of the US beef industry, four airlines control about 80% of domestic passenger traffic, Walmart accounts for the majority of grocery sales in the majority of US states, the list goes on and on. And it’s not just the companies that have outsized control. Large investors also a role to play. Schmalz pointed to the Investment Company Act, which limits investment funds to holding no more than 10% of a corporation’s securities. Vanguard on average holds 10% of all S&P 500 companies, Schmalz research has found, but it is not violating the law because companies within its fund family own the shares, not Vanguard itself. But Vanguard still executes the voting rights of more than 10% of shareholders. “The law is written at the fund level so technically speaking they don’t violate the law, but they are violating the spirit of the law,” Schmalz said. Economists and attorneys working on US antitrust law have proposed prosecuting mutual funds like BlackRock or Vanguard that own large stakes in multiple companies in the same sector. Such shareholders can exert an outsize influence on companies’ pricing decisions, Schmalz said, and he noted Investment Company Act language that specifically targets this scenario: “The national public interest … is adversely affected … when investment companies [have] great size [and] excessive influence on the national economy.” Schmalz said there’s little discussion among policymakers to address that specific issue. Biden’s budget includes over $220m for antitrust enforcement, and bills that would break up large tech companies have bipartisan Senate and House support. The Guardian’s analysis highlighted the commodity market boom as companies trading in grain, steel, mining, wood, rubber, meat, oil, homes and other materials generally recorded higher profit increases than companies across the rest of the economy. However, many commodity companies operate in what analysts characterize as “feast and famine” cycles in which they’re unprofitable for years before cashing in. The pendulum has swung for many commodity companies in the day’s economic climate. “When there’s a chance to raise prices when markets are tight, companies are going to do so,” said Skanda Amarnath, executive director of the Employ America thinktank. “It’s some part opportunistic, some part greed, some part rationality, some part a response to uncertainty.” The oil industry highlights the dynamic. After seven years of low returns, it’s restricting supply to boost profits regardless of how that hits Americans at the pump. Earnings calls transcripts reveal executives eagerly “putting shareholders first” and an investor who described industry-wide supply suppression “one of the delights of this earnings season”. Bringing volatile commodity prices under control would require curtailing uncertainty and building supply chain resiliency, analysts who spoke with the Guardian say. That could involve some degree of government intervention to cut down on risk by establishing a floor on commodity prices. The government could do that by effectively becoming the “buyer of last resort” when material prices dip below a certain level. But the government should also set a ceiling above which it collects profits, said commodities analyst Alex Turnbull. He suggested the federal government set up what’s effectively a state reserve board. Turnbull pointed to lithium, which, amid increased demand for EV batteries and supply chain squeezes, jumped from $5,000 a ton to $45,000 a ton last year. Higher prices impact the pace of the clean energy transition, and the government could hypothetically set a $10,000 a ton floor price and $25,000 a ton ceiling that would limit the volatility, Turnbull said. The federal government could also increase stockpile reserves of products like grain or oil that are released when prices spike. “That sends the message ‘You should plant more wheat because if it goes really bad, you might have a lean year or two, but we will buy your wheat. But on the other hand don’t expect to buy a Lamborghini if you’re a farmer in Iowa because when prices get too high we’ll be out there selling the shit out of our stockpiles,’” Turnbull said. Stabilization may also spur investment in raw material production that’s risky, which would further bolster markets against future supply shortages. Few companies have built steel plants in recent years because the prices have been so low, Turnbull noted, and now the world is short on steel. Though price caps are “not politically palatable” Bespoke Investment analyst George Pearkes said, the government could take a number of measures to steer futures curves and markets for raw commodities like oil and wheat. “Something in between where there are strategic efforts to smooth volatility, and provide the private sector with enough certainty that they can make decisions is a lot more compelling,” he said. Spikes in investment for some commodities, like nickel, that are essential to the clean energy transition, can be a positive development, Turnbull said. Mining companies limped through the several years leading up to the pandemic, but reaped windfalls over the last year. “People say ‘Nickel producers are making too much money’, well, they didn’t make money for a decade,” Turnbull said. “At some point, somebody has to put money down to dig holes because people aren’t going to drive to the middle of fucking nowhere with a truck and work for free.” Another force in some commodity price spikes: Wall Street speculation. Commodity markets were once heavily regulated because they deal in raw materials that underpin the economy. An influx of investment capital followed the commodity markets’ deregulation about 20 years ago, and some are now treated like speculative assets similar to bitcoin, said Rupert Russell, who authored a book on the topic. The consequences of economy-addling commodity price spikes are real, he adds, pointing to the 2010 grain prices that helped trigger the Arab spring uprising in Tunisia. Supply chain back ups, inflation and war have generated “radical uncertainty” in which no one knows how much commodities are worth, because the prices are no longer anchored, Russell told the Guardian. He echoed others’ calls for stronger government intervention to tamp down the casino-like mentality. “Once there’s not just radical uncertainty but markets dominated by speculators, algorithmically driven speculation that is just kind of responding to headlines, then you’re going to get that kind of Bitcoin-esque volatility,” he said. But experts say there are few viable short-term solutions, and long-term measures don’t help Holmes. That’s forcing her to think about getting another job to survive as she feels the pressure of an economic system stacked against her. “I don’t want to. I’ve got four kids to take care of, but what am I supposed to do?” she asked.",News/Business,‘What am I going to do?’: soaring prices fuel calls for US government to step in,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/30/us-inflation-price-increases-government-response
4/30/2022,"The plan was to meet Joe Alwyn at an old‑fashioned pub in the area of London where he grew up. It’s a nice pub, tiny, a selection of beers with wacky names on tap, percentage proofs that would make your eyes water. But we both arrive just before noon, and the doors are locked, so we awkwardly hang around outside, peering in through the window, looking to all the world as though we are desperate for a late-morning drink. I am not sure that Alwyn is as desperate to speak to me, though over the course of a slow and steady pint, he is very polite and easy company. The actor, 31, has been on the brink of being a big star ever since he left drama school in 2015, but his route to fame has run at a slightly different angle from his route to acting success. His partner is Taylor Swift, one of the most famous women on the planet, so there is that. He is tall, handsome, with floppy 90s heart-throb hair. He is quick and funny and confident, low-key in a fleece and jeans. For a while, we are the only people in the pub. He uses humour to deflect awkwardness, and I suspect it suits him that nobody can hear what we’re saying. Alwyn is about to star as Nick, the married, maudlin actor who has an affair with a student, Frances, in Conversations With Friends. The adaptation is the second of Sally Rooney’s novels to be made into a television series, after the lockdown-fuelled smash hit Normal People. The director of both, Lenny Abrahamson, said he cast Alwyn as Nick in part because he was “soulful”. “What does that mean?” Alwyn splutters. You tell me, Joe. “I’ll take it. I don’t know! So soulful,” he repeats, with a hint of embarrassment. Rooney had a say in who played her characters. “I was told she was doing this and that,” he says, waggling a thumb up and down. “I mean, not literally doing that, like a gladiator or an emperor. She was involved in casting and watching tapes.” When he got the part, due to his soulfulness presumably, he contacted the author, and they exchanged a few emails. The shoot was going to be in Dublin, where they planned to meet, but late in the day it moved to Belfast. “So we didn’t. But I sent her an email just being like, ‘Thank you’, basically. Thanks for the thumbs up, Sally.” Rooney’s books are full of highly articulate emails and texts. “She does a good email,” he nods. So how did you approach the pressure of emailing her? “Many, many drafts. I did my best email. It just felt really nice to have her blessing.” Alwyn had read Conversations With Friends and Normal People already, long before his involvement in the former. “I read Normal People before I knew they were making a show out of it, and I remember when I saw it thinking, I’d love to be in something like that.” Normal People’s sex scenes between Connell (Paul Mescal) and Marianne (Daisy Edgar-Jones) became such a talking point that people began to lust over Mescal’s silver chain, as if everything else about him had been exhausted. In Conversations With Friends, Nick has a heated affair with Frances, and Alwyn is fairly regularly, if tastefully, naked in it. “We were guided through it with an intimacy coordinator, Ita O’Brien, who is great,” he says. “They’re essentially choreographed. So they’re like fight scenes. They’re quite mechanical. And obviously they’re weird, funny, strange things to do with your friends. But when Lenny’s in the room, cracking jokes, and there’s 10 crew members around, and it’s freezing cold or boiling hot, it just takes all the sexiness out of it.” Besides, he says, the sex scenes are there for a reason. “They are kind of extensions of the conversations, in their own way. Each one, hopefully, should feel slightly different and mean something different to the people involved, and they’re not just kind of gratuitously thrown in. But, I mean, obviously, it’s a weird part of the job.” Normal People and Conversations With Friends are different stories, and different series, in many ways, but if his series follows the Mescal trajectory, is he prepared for the idea that he might become a pin-up? “I honestly just don’t have any thoughts about it,” he says. They only finished filming four months ago. “I haven’t let myself think, ‘Oh God, people are actually going to see it’, so I haven’t thought about that side of things. Which is a boring answer, I know.” Anyway, this is a serious drama, not a bonkbuster, and it deals with serious themes. Nick is married to Melissa (Jemima Kirke), a successful writer, and their marriage has not always been monogamous. But when Frances (newcomer Alison Oliver) and her best friend and ex-girlfriend Bobby (Sasha Lane) start to entangle themselves in their lives, the four of them are forced to ask grownup questions about love, jealousy and honesty. Nick is certainly a complicated character who runs hot and cold, and he is difficult to pin down. “When you meet him, he’s in a place of recovery – he’s been through a storm and is slightly numb to the world. And he’s just kind of functioning, and we meet that version of him, but we don’t really know why,” Alwyn says. It isn’t until later in the series that we start to learn who he is. “He can be a real enigma, and sometimes frustratingly so. He’s quite aloof and enigmatic and unreadable.” I am not sure that Alwyn is aloof, but he has more than a touch of the enigmatic and unreadable about him. He has been a steadily successful actor since 2016, when his first job was to star in the Ang Lee-directed Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk, alongside Kristen Stewart. He followed it up with smaller roles in a series of award-winning films, including The Favourite, Mary Queen of Scots, and Harriet. He has fronted campaigns for Prada, and has also won a Grammy, after collaborating with Swift on her 2020 album Folklore. Despite all of this, I say, I don’t know very much about you. Few details of his life are public, which he seems to prefer, but it does mean we have to start at the beginning. So you grew up … “I grew up in this pub,” he cuts in, grinning. “I was born in this garden and I’ve never left. Very happy here, thank you.” He actually grew up near where we are today, in Tufnell Park, a well-to-do neighbourhood in north London. His mother is a psychotherapist. “I never felt like I was lying down on the couch and being analysed every evening, which is probably a good thing. I managed to escape that. But she’s great with people and great to talk to. People always think that must be strange, having a mum who’s a therapist.” Well, it is interesting. “It definitely is. It’s an amazing job. I actually think if I didn’t do this, I would be interested in doing something like that.” His father is a documentary film-maker who also teaches film-making. He instilled a love of films in the young Alwyn by giving him stacks of VHS tapes for his birthday and Christmas presents. “He makes fly-on-the-wall, observational human stories. When I was growing up, he was often away, and I remember him being in these far-flung places a lot, bringing back cool gifts for me and my brother.” Did you ever go with him? “I was never invited.” He leaves a beat. “Don’t worry, I spoke to my mum about it,” he quips. He has two brothers, one older, who works for an NGO, and one much younger, who was born when he was at secondary school, and has just left school himself. Alwyn went to a private boys’ school, on a scholarship and bursary. He enjoyed it, and made a group of friends that he still speaks to all the time, even today. He didn’t really act at school; he mostly played sport. “I was good at football. Tennis. I just like athletics, generally.” He squirms. “‘Just generally’. It sounds so arrogant! ‘All of them’.” Were people surprised that he wanted to be an actor? “I feel like I’d given enough hints that it wasn’t a complete bombshell when I wanted to do it, but I do think there was probably a feeling of, why?” He studied English and drama at Bristol University, and then went to drama school in London. Immediately after his final showcase, so the fairytale version of the story goes, he signed with an agent and was asked to audition for Lee, the Oscar-winning director of Brokeback Mountain, Sense and Sensibility, and The Ice Storm. Was it really that simple? “It was as mad as that,” Alwyn says. He sent over a tape, and got a call saying Lee wanted to meet him that weekend. “So they put me on a plane. I hadn’t been to America before.” He landed in New York, in the snow, and immediately went out to find a New York slice of pizza. “Within five days, I’d left school, had a visa and was in boot camp in Atlanta. As it went on, I managed to relax and enjoy it. But at the beginning, in the first week or two of shooting, I was shitting myself.” And then it was over. “Everyone else stayed in America. I had to go back home and walk the dog the next day, it was pouring rain and I was back in this garden,” he smiles. “And life continued.” After Billy Lynn, Alwyn had a run of nasty characters, historical figures, and sometimes both. He was a slave-owner in Harriet, and the son of a Nazi in Operation Finale. In The Favourite, he has a comic turn as Masham, who seduces Emma Stone’s Abigail, dances a silly dance with Rachel Weisz as Lady Sarah, and is a thorn in the side of Olivia Colman’s Queen Anne. “All three of them are amazing. Just down-to-earth, funny, nice people.” He says that it is fascinating to watch Colman work. “Because it can be so easy to sit in the corner full of nerves hyping yourself up for a scene, but she is so chilled and fun and cracking jokes, and then she’s just in it and out, and then it’s done.” Masham is a supporting character, a small-ish role, but Alwyn decided early on that he would rather take smaller parts with directors he admired than always go for the big, splashy jobs. “There are a couple of things I probably did just because I wanted to work, but I’ve tried to be pretty picky,” he says. Does that require a healthy ego, to be happy to play the supporting role, rather than insisting on being the star? “The idea of being the lead role just for the sake of it seems ridiculous,” he says, then catches himself. He likes to make sure he is being understood. “Well, it doesn’t seem ridiculous. Each to their own. But I’d much rather play an interesting support role in an interesting film. I find that more attractive.” Since 2016, if the internet is to be believed – details are sparse, and will remain so, largely – Alwyn has been in a relationship with Swift. His film career brought him a level of recognition, but the level of fame he has been exposed to around his relationship is something else entirely. Was that a shock? “It’s not something I think about, unless I’m in situations like this, and someone says, ‘What’s it like?’ and I have to think about what to say about it,” he says, though he does have plenty to say on it, which suggests he has thought about it at least a little bit. He is more clipped when he talks about this side of things, and a bit less jokey, as if practised in being firm. “It’s just not for other people,” he says, of their relationship. “And I don’t say that with aggression.” He will concede that he can see why people might be interested in it. And people are interested. Her 2019 song London Boy, about fancying a charming, sporty north London boy with lots of mates, is rumoured to be about him, but, other than that, they say very little about each other in public. I tell him I watched a nine-minute compilation on YouTube that collected everything they had said about their relationship in public into one handy video. “Well, I hope that was illuminating,” he says, drily. It wasn’t, actually. “That doesn’t surprise me, because I don’t know what people would be going off.” He pauses, for what seems like an age. “I don’t know how best to talk about it. I mean, I’m aware of people’s … of that size of interest, and that world existing. It’s just not something I particularly care about, or have much interest in feeding, I guess, because the more it’s fed, the more you are opening a gate for intrusion.” He is aware that this makes him sound guarded. “I think that’s just my response to a culture that has this increasing expectation that everything is going to be given. If you don’t post about the way you make your coffee in the morning, or if you don’t let someone take a picture when you walk out of your front door, is that being private? I don’t know if it is. So I just don’t really feed that.” His own Instagram is strictly work-based, and there is little hint of anything beyond a film set. “If you and I were having a conversation, and having a shandy in my house, and it wasn’t being recorded, then, of course, other things would be said,” he says, echoing what Swift told this paper in 2019. (“If you and I were having a glass of wine right now, we’d be talking about it – but it’s just that it goes out into the world,” she said, back then.) Did they decide, from the beginning, to have a party line, and not to talk about each other? “Erm. It was just like, well, why? There are more interesting things to talk about and I just think it feeds into a weird part of the culture that I’m not really interested in being a part of.” One thing he will talk about is their musical collaboration, which turned him into a Grammy winner. I did want to ask about music, I say. “Go for it, and I will sing for you,” he jokes, happier to be back on solid ground. When Swift released Folklore, two of the songs, Betty and Exile, credited a mysterious co-writer called William Bowery. Fans speculated as to who it might be, and Swift later revealed that it was a pseudonym for Alwyn, who also co-wrote some of the songs on its follow-up, Evermore. “That was a surreal bonus of lockdown,” he says, checking himself. “That’s an understatement.” What was it like to work with your other half, in her line of business? “It wasn’t like, ‘It’s five o’clock, it’s time to try and write a song together,’” he says. “It came about from messing around on a piano, and singing badly, then being overheard, and being, like, ‘Let’s see what happens if we get to the end of it together.’ ” He liked it because there were no expectations and no pressure. “I mean fun is such a stupid word, but it was a lot of fun. And it was never a work thing, or a ‘Let’s try and do this because we’re going to put this out’ thing. It was just like baking sourdough in lockdown.” But not everyone’s sourdough resulted in a Grammy. “The Grammy was obviously this ridiculous bonus.” Did he have any musical ambitions before this? “I like music, and I played a bit of guitar awfully in a school band when I was 12.” They were called Anger Management, and they covered Marilyn Manson’s version of the Eurythmics’ Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This). “I can play piano pretty badly, but never with the intent of, ‘Right, it’s time for my jazz-fusion album.’” He grins. “Unfortunately.” He’s joking, but if a jazz-fusion album does emerge one day, it wouldn’t be such a curveball. He is about to take some time off and has no immediate jobs lined up, he says, which is fine by him, as last year was so busy. His recent work indicates a Robert Pattinson-style swerve into the arthouse. He had a small role in Joanna Hogg’s The Souvenir: Part II, and his next two films will be Stars at Noon, an adaptation of a Denis Johnson novel directed by Claire Denis, and Catherine, Called Birdy, a medieval comedy directed by Lena Dunham. “Again, I think that all comes from working with Ang Lee, and the luxury of that at the beginning,” he says. “I would just much rather do that for now and ‘build’, which sounds awful,” he says, beginning to collapse into a cringe, “and like, oh, grow as an actor, which also sounds awful.” He looks mortified. “Do you know what I mean?” I think I know what he means. He sounds like someone who is satisfied with life as it is, and where it’s about to take him. We finish our pints. Alwyn is heading off to meet someone on Hampstead Heath, and we shake hands, politely, as we say goodbye. He heads out into the street, eyes on the path just ahead.

4/30/2022,"Photos are precious records of our lives, and as the summer kicks off many of us will be adding to our collection as we enjoy holidays and celebrate special occasions. For many of us, however, these pictures end up locked on our phones, taking up storage and at risk of loss. Without proper and timely backups – or printed copies – a smashed, stolen or accidentally wiped phone could instantly wipe out snaps of your child’s first birthday, that once-in-a-lifetime trip or just that picture you love enough to make your wallpaper. We’ve had a look at the best options for storage and printing, how much they cost and what you get for your money – and have a guide to how to take photos you will want to keep. More than just ensuring treasured memories are safe, backing up your photos makes them much more accessible from computers, tablets and even digital photo frames. Also, it can free up space on your phone so that you no longer have to continually delete things to make it work. It is extremely easy and there are many different options available from a range of companies, starting from the princely sum of free. The best will use an app to automatically upload your photos from your phone to secure cloud storage. From there you can view them on apps and the web, meaning you can carry around access to every photo you have ever taken and relive memories at any time. However, there are other options if you would rather store them on your phone or device, or curate which ones are saved, or make some public or even sell them. Four of the best cloud photo backup systems are made by the traditional tech firms, Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft, most of which have a free tier and options to pay should you need more storage. Backups from your phone happen over wifi or mobile data the moment you shoot a photo, which means your snaps are safe very soon after you’ve taken them. But be warned, taking lots of photos and backing them up while out and about can eat through your mobile data allowance if it is quite small. Normal phone photos typically range from one to 5MB each but special high resolution ones can easily be 15MB or more. If this is likely to be a problem, check the settings on the app and switch off the option to automatically upload shots via mobile data. Apple iCloud5GB free; 50GB 79p a month If you have an iPhone, iCloud is Apple’s default backup and cloud storage system. It is where backups and documents of your iPhone or iPad are stored if you ever need to retrieve them. It is quick and easy but you get only 5GB of space for free, which is typically only enough for a backup of the apps and some photos on one or two devices. Photos and videos can be automatically uploaded to iCloud and then viewed on other Apple devices or the web. Windows PCs can back up photos to iCloud but Android devices cannot. Photos from a camera can be manually uploaded via a computer, too. If you use an iPhone provided by your employer you may not be able to or want to use a personal iCloud account on it. It costs from 79p a month to upgrade the space to 50GB, which should be enough for most people’s entire collection of photos and videos. Google Photos15GB free; 100GB £15.99 a year Google Photos is the default picture backup system on most Android smartphones but is cross-platform and available on iPhones, iPads, Macs and Windows PCs, plus the web, too. Photos uses the same free 15GB of storage shared with your Gmail and Google Drive. It automatically backs up your photos and videos using the Google Photos app and lets you view, organise, search, edit, share or clear them from your phone’s storage. Shared photo albums can be made with anyone with a Google account, making collecting snaps from group holidays or events a doddle. You can back up photos and videos in “storage saver”, which compresses them to save space reducing quality slightly in the process, or the larger original quality. Photos will even back up the digital equivalent of negatives, called RAW files, from some cameras. You can use a different Google account from your main one to use the free 15GB only for photos. Google One plans add more space starting at £15.99 a year for 100GB, which will be plenty for most people. You can manually upload photos from a camera using the web, too. Google lets you print off photo books costing from £15.99 plus delivery – you can choose pictures and layouts and add captions before you do. It also integrates with Assistant smart displays such as the Nest Hub, turning them into excellent digital photo frames. Microsoft OneDrive5GB free; 1TB with Microsoft 365 £5.99 a month Microsoft’s OneDrive is a general cloud storage drive that can also automatically backup photos and videos on Android, iPhone, Mac or PC. You can manually upload photos from a camera via a computer or the web. It lacks some of the more advanced features of Apple or Google’s tools but you get 5GB of space for free. The most appealing part of OneDrive is that you get a huge 1TB of storage if you have a Microsoft 365 account, which is the subscription service for Microsoft Office that costs from £5.99 a month. Amazon Prime PhotosUnlimited photos, 5GB of videos £7.99 a month Amazon offers unlimited automatic photo backups from Android and iPhone, plus PC or Mac via a browser or desktop apps, as part of its Prime subscription, which starts at £7.99 a month. The phone apps allow you to organise, search, edit and share photos. Up to 5GB of videos are also backed up with extra storage available for a fee if needed. Prime Photos integrates with Alexa smart displays such as the Amazon’s Echo Show line, turning them into good-looking digital photo frames. If you want to back up your photos for free without using the cloud, manually storing them on a computer or external drive is another option. You can transfer photos to your computer from your phone simply by plugging it in via USB, as you would a storage drive. From there you can transfer them to an external drive for safekeeping. I recommend storing them in at least two locations in case of theft or fire. If you are looking for a place to show off your photos, there are cloud photo services geared more towards enthusiasts or professional photographers that offer hosting with a portal to show them publicly or license them for use. Adobe’s Creative Cloud offers the Lightroom photo development app and 1TB of cloud storage for £9.98 a month. SmugMug offers unlimited photo storage, a personalised photo site and desktop and mobile apps for $11 (£8.79) a month. SmugMug-owned Flickr offers storage for 1,000 photos for free, with 50 kept private and the rest made public, or unlimited photo storage from £6.99 a month. 500px is another alternative that promotes licensing of photos for money, with free accounts limited to seven uploads a week and unlimited accounts starting at $6.49 a month. Most cloud photo backup services support videos, too, but the size of video files quickly eats into your storage limits. Videos shot in 4K at 60 frames a second on an iPhone, for instance, require about 400MB a minute or about 90MB if reduced to 1080p resolution. Some backup services have restrictions on the size or quality of the video, or options to compress it to save space. Local backup or large general-purpose cloud storage drives can offer cheaper alternatives for manual backing up of lots of videos. It can be nice to have cherished photos in a physical form. The most popular options include 6x4in (10x15cm) single prints and photobooks. Some of the photo backup firms have printing services but for those that do not there are many online or in-store alternatives. You can print from your computer, phone, camera or memory card with most. Snapfish is a longstanding service offering individual prints costing from 10p or photobooks from £10 plus delivery. Warwick-based Cewe specialises in photobooks from £5.99 plus shipping and also runs Boot’s photo-printing services. The high street chain SnappySnaps offers in-store and online photo printing from 65p for a single photo. Max Spielmann runs Tesco’s photo services and offers similar, from 35p for singles or from £15 for photobooks. Many larger supermarkets have photo-printing kiosks, too, for instant prints. Most services offer bulk rates, if printing hundreds of photos. The best photobook services give you the option to create one with only a few clicks or spend hours customising them. If you go for the simplest version, you will typically get a book with a photo, or photos, on each page, and no bells and whistles. The customised options mean putting in more time to choose and arrange your photos. Many services offer different themes or framing options, from simple white borders to fancy designs based on the season or events such as holidays or family gatherings. You upload your photos, crop and move them between boxes on the page, and add captions and titles. Most will let you save your projects before printing them, too, so you don’t have to do it all in one sitting. Digital photo frames display a rotating slideshow of your photos. They come in various sizes and capabilities, with the cheapest models starting at about £55. However, be warned, even more expensive ones are hamstrung by poor interfaces and difficulties in making photos fit properly. If you use either Google or Amazon’s photo backup solutions, their smart displays, which start at as little as £50, make better digital photo frames that can show curated or automated selections of your snaps and provide many more features for the price. The best camera is the one you have on you, which these days usually means the one on the phone in your pocket. Camera quality is the current battleground between the big manufacturers, which means there are some great options. But if taking the best possible photos is important to you, you’ll need to spend a at least £600 on a high-end phone. Google Pixel 6, £599 Arguably, the best bargain in high-end smartphone cameras is Google’s Pixel 6. Its main 50-megapixel camera is one of the best you can get on a phone, capturing a stunning amount of detail across a large range of conditions, including low light. Its 12MP ultrawide camera is good, too, but the phone lacks an optical zoom leaving you with digital zoom up to 7x. Stick to 2-3x and you will get good results. The Pixel 6 Pro at £849 has an extra 4x optical zoom camera, which is excellent, too. Apple iPhone 13 Pro, £949 Apple’s best iPhone also has its best camera. All three of the iPhone 13 Pro’s 12-megapixel cameras – main, ultrawide and 3x telephoto – are among the best available, producing sharp, detailed and balanced shots in a variety of lighting conditions. The 3x optical zoom camera is particularly good, and meaningfully closes the distance to objects compared with previous models but falls short of some extended zooms such as that from Samsung. Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, £1,149 Samsung’s biggest, most expensive mobile, the S22 Ultra, also has the most powerful and adaptable camera you can get. It has a fantastic 108MP main camera with excellent low-light performance and a very good 12MP ultrawide camera. However, it is the pair of 12MP telephoto cameras on the back with a 3x and 10x optical zoom that is unbeatable, getting you closer to faraway objects than any other phone.",Lifestyle/Money,"Picture perfect: how to take, store and print photos from your phone",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/30/how-to-take-store-print-photos-phone
4/30/2022,"“America’s Hitler.” “A total fraud.” “A moral disaster.” Those were a few of the descriptions that JD Vance, bestselling author of the memoir Hillbilly Elegy, once offered for Donald Trump. But none of that past criticism was evident here last Saturday night, as Vance shared a stage with Trump to accept the former president’s endorsement in the Ohio Senate Republican primary. “He’s the guy that said some bad shit about me,” Trump said of Vance during his rally at the Delaware county fairgrounds. “If I went by that standard, I don’t think I would have ever endorsed anybody in the country.” Taking the podium as the rally crowd chanted his name, Vance said, “The president is right. I wasn’t always nice, but the simple fact is, he’s the best president of my lifetime, and he revealed the corruption in this country like nobody else.” In less than six years, Vance has gone from a Trump skeptic who openly contemplated voting for Hillary Clinton to a devoted loyalist who has endorsed finishing the border wall and denounced identity politics as a Democratic gimmick. Vance’s radical shift reflects the larger transformation of the Republican party, as it has become nearly impossible to succeed in a primary as a Trump critic. The stakes are high for Republicans in Ohio, as they try to hold on to retiring Senator Rob Portman’s seat and ultimately regain control of the evenly divided upper chamber of Congress. The Republican candidate who wins the 3 May primary will probably face off against Democratic congressman Tim Ryan in the general election. The Republican primary winner, whoever it is, will then be favored to win in November, considering Trump defeated Joe Biden in Ohio by eight points in 2020. For Trump, the Ohio Senate election also represents the biggest test yet for his most influential tool as party leader: a primary endorsement. Trump’s endorsement of Vance was considered a gamble, given that he had been trailing in the limited public polling of the race. Before Trump’s announcement, former state treasurer Josh Mandel and businessman Mike Gibbons were widely considered the two frontrunners in the primary. But a new poll released this week showed Vance pulling ahead of Mandel and Gibbons. “Before the Trump endorsement, I think JD was probably top of the second tier behind Gibbons and Mandel,” said Mike Hartley, who previously served as a senior adviser to former Ohio governor and Republican presidential candidate John Kasich. “I believe that the former president’s endorsement has made this race an actual toss-up.” Now Vance is counting on Trump’s endorsement to carry him to victory. And Trump is counting on that, too. When Vance announced his Senate candidacy last year, he began his campaign with a remorse tour, seizing every opportunity to explain his change of heart about Trump. “I ask folks not to judge me based on what I said in 2016,” Vance told Fox News last July. “I’ve been very open that I did say those critical things and I regret them, and I regret being wrong about the guy.” Vance’s groveling was successful in convincing the person whose opinion mattered most in the race: Trump. The former president announced earlier this month that he would endorse Vance, even though several candidates, including Mandel and Gibbons, had been openly campaigning for Trump’s support. “Like some others, JD Vance may have said some not so great things about me in the past, but he gets it now, and I have seen that in spades,” Trump said in his endorsement. “He is our best chance for victory in what could be a very tough race.” But Vance’s critics have not been so easily convinced. As reports emerged of the likely endorsement, Ohio Republican leaders who had backed other candidates circulated a letter urging Trump to reconsider. The letter noted that Vance had previously attacked some of Trump’s supporters as racist and chose to support independent candidate Evan McMullin in the 2016 presidential election, after he considered voting for Clinton. “I don’t have a problem with somebody changing their mind about somebody, and JD Vance has expressed on any number of occasions that he changed his mind as Trump held office,” Gibbons told the Guardian during an event with supporters in Powell, Ohio, last week. “What troubles me is that he actually kind of played with voting for Hillary Clinton. And I don’t think you can have a shred of conservative ideology to think for one second about voting for Hillary Clinton.” Despite the last-minute effort to prevent the endorsement, Trump went ahead with his plans to publicly back Vance. Rather than inspiring unity among Ohio Republicans, the endorsement appears to have injected even more vitriol into a race that was already defined by, as one columnist said, “meanness and pettiness and just plain craziness”. The conservative group Club for Growth, which has thrown its support behind Mandel in the race, has continued to air ads highlighting Vance’s past negative comments about Trump. This week, the group released a new ad arguing Trump had made the wrong choice in backing Vance and highlighting the former president’s 2012 endorsement of Mitt Romney, who lost to Barack Obama. When Trump learned that Club for Growth, with whom he has worked in the past, was standing by its endorsement of Mandel, he reportedly had his assistant text the group’s president, “Go fuck yourself.” Trump’s closest allies have engaged in similar mudslinging, intent on proving that the former president’s endorsement is enough to guarantee victory in a close race. Donald Trump Jr, the former president’s eldest son, who has campaigned with Vance in recent days, attacked Mandel on Twitter as the “Club for Chinese Growth backed establishment candidate”. Both Mandel and Vance have the backing of super PACs that have spent millions of dollars to aid their campaigns, making it even easier to flood the airwaves with attack ads. The pro-Vance group Protect Ohio Values has been propped up by $13.5m in donations from the tech investor Peter Thiel, who reportedly lobbied Trump directly for his endorsement. Meanwhile, Gibbons has mostly self-funded his run, lending more than $16m to his campaign. The cost of the primary has given Ohio Democrats, who have relished the ugliness of the Republican race, another opening to criticize the entire field of candidates. “It was already a race to the bottom, and Trump’s visit will make it a photo-finish to the gutter for this nasty, chaotic and expensive primary,” Elizabeth Walters, chair of the Ohio Democratic party, said ahead of the former president’s rally. “No matter which one of them hobbles out of the primary, we are ready to fight back and show working families that we’re on their side.” Vance is hoping that Trump’s endorsement will be enough to ensure he is the candidate who “hobbles out of the primary”, and there are indeed signs that he has picked up support. A Fox News poll taken after Trump’s announcement showed Vance leading Mandel by five points, although that advantage is within the survey’s margin of error. Gibbons is now trailing Vance by 10 points, the poll found. “The endorsement’s already given us a ton of momentum,” Vance told reporters after his town hall last week in Huber Heights, just outside Dayton. “It’s my race to lose, but at the end of the day, we still have to do the work.” At Vance’s town hall, several attendees said Trump’s endorsement had brought their attention to Vance in a new way. Judy Coeling, a 59-year-old primary voter from Centerville, said she had previously been deciding between Mandel and Gibbons, but Trump’s endorsement had prompted her to reconsider Vance. “I came just to find out more information because I had two other people in mind that I was kind of debating,” Coeling said. “I think he’s probably a lot stronger than what I gave him credit for.” Despite his opponents’ efforts to smear him for his past criticism of Trump, some of Vance’s supporters also said that they understood his negative opinion because they also once had their doubts about the former president. “I thought Trump had no chance, and then I saw how skilled he was,” said Evron Colhoun, a retiree from Englewood who volunteers with the Vance campaign. “I would say that I identified with that, too, because we had a similar evolution [with Trump]. I mean, I was really surprised that Vance got his endorsement, but I see why.” “I get where he’s coming from,” Brian Kitchen, a 48-year-old voter from Huber Heights, said of Vance’s past anti-Trump views. “I was a Kasich supporter, so I still have a Kasich bumper sticker on my other car.” Vance’s opponents have attempted to downplay the impact of the endorsement, claiming they have not seen a significant decline in their support. “I literally have gotten – and I’m not exaggerating – hundreds of texts saying, ‘We’re with you,’” Gibbons said. “I’ve only had one person that said they were switching their vote.” Standing outside an early voting site in Columbus last week, Drew Sample, 37, said he had still voted for Gibbons because of his misgivings about Vance. “I don’t completely dislike him. I just don’t think he’s qualified to be senator,” Sample said. “He’s an opportunist. I think most of these guys are opportunists.” At the Trump rally in Delaware, some of the former president’s most ardent admirers were not persuaded by his endorsement of Vance. Jessica Dicken, a 31-year-old voter from Logan, said she would instead be supporting Mark Pukita, who has bragged about being unvaccinated and was accused of making an antisemitic ad about Mandel. (He denied that charge.) “I kind of think for myself,” Dicken said as she lined up hours early to enter the rally grounds. “I definitely support Trump, but I’m going to vote for my own Ohio primary who I feel is fit and who’s best.” Laura Beringer, another Pukita supporter from Akron standing a bit behind Dicken in line, added, “I love Trump, but he’s not perfect. I don’t have to follow his every whim. I have to go by what I feel.” Democrats are hoping they will be able to capitalize on those internal divisions in November and flip Portman’s seat. “Trump’s visit won’t unite the party,” Walters said. “All it really does is throw more fuel on the dumpster fire that is the Senate and gubernatorial races in Ohio on the Republican side.” But Republicans in Ohio – and across the country – have a number of factors working in their favor for November. The president’s party traditionally loses seats in Congress during the midterm elections, and Biden’s approval rating continues to languish in the low 40s. The Cook Political Report has rated the Ohio Senate race as “lean Republican”. “I think any of the [top candidates] will beat Tim Ryan,” Hartley said. “With this political environment, if a Republican doesn’t win, it’s going to be their own damn fault.”",News/US news,JD Vance’s Senate run is a test of Trump’s influence on the Republican party,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/29/jd-vance-senate-ohio-trump-influence-republican-party
4/30/2022,"Amber Heard has sat impassively through 10 days of Johnny Depp’s $50m defamation against her stemming from their volatile 15 month marriage. Next week, the 36-year-old actor will get to present her version of events in support of a $100m counter claim for nuisance. Whomever prevails in the end, and perhaps neither, the trial between the pair has been an unedifying spectacle of a horrifying relationship that so far only Depp has had the opportunity to present to the court. The damage to each of them from their marriage, divorce and subsequent highly public and epic legal battles is conspicuous. Heard walked away with a $14m settlement under California’s communal property no-fault divorce laws, using the threat of a restraining order to negotiate for more, but little in the way of a movie career. Depp, too, lost work, having being dropped by Disney’s Pirates franchise when allegations of domestic abuse against were made by Heard in 2016. And for both, the long days of recent testimony have taken the sheen off any sense the public may have that either of the actors’ lives of apparent wealth and glamor were in any way enviable. Instead, it has been a painful story of substance abuse, a deeply dysfunctional marriage and professional woes and plotting. While Depp consoled himself touring with his band, Hollywood Vampires – a group that Christian Carino, the couple’s former talent agent, testified last week was not a commercial proposition – Heard became an ambassador for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) specializing in gender-based violence. The court was told that the venerable civil rights group had written the draft of the now infamous Washington Post article upon which this legal action is based, and placed it in the outlet to coincide with the release of Heard’s Aquaman superhero movie. Heard, the ACLU’s general counsel testified, had pressed to go further, identifying herself as an abuse survivor, but her lawyers had excised the passages lest it violated her divorce non-disclosure agreement. Depp’s generalized argument – that he was docile as a prescription opioid addict, but wrestled with a “monster” when drinking – was coupled with observations made on Friday that household alcohol spending dropped from $160,000 a year during their marriage to “virtually nil” today. Some of that spending, Depp’s accountant testified, went toward Heard’s taste for $500-a-bottle Vega Cecilia wine. The grim tableau presented to the court peaked this week with images of Depp’s exploded finger after a fight in a rented house in Australia that was re-decorated with blood and broken glass, causing $50,000 in damages. The unedifying testimony, provided by a succession of aides, agents, concierge doctors, psychoanalysts, housekeepers, doormen and bodyguards, has left the impression of an appalling lifestyle environment that might have been brought to account sooner if there were fewer resources and enablers to support it. “I would have required that each of them be in an abstinence-only program with random drug tests that confirm their level of sobriety, and I would have required both to do 12-step work,” said New York therapist Dr Darcy Sterling, host of E! Network’s Famously Single. “The step work is the work that deflates the ego – the arrogance, the propensity to view oneself as a victim with no role in the consequences of their life – so that they could come together without pointing fingers at the other.” But the trial has provided insight into how celebrity justice might be warped. Expert witness Dr Shannon Curry refuted an implication that her psychological diagnosis of Heard was tainted by being taken out to dinner by Depp and his attorneys, an inference she rejected. At times what the court has delved into has been bizarre as lawyers sought to prove undue influence. For example, Heard attorney Elaine Bredehoft pressed Curry on exactly who had brought muffins to her practice on the day Heard came for examination. Curry testified that it had been her husband, but that her husband had not known a celebrity client was coming. “May I clarify what occurred so that we can stop talking about the muffins?” Curry said on the stand. “What happened was that I was getting ready that morning, I frequently bring muffins to the office.” In the absence of Heard’s testimony, public opinion appears to be so far siding with Depp. According to a Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey, 40% of those polled said Depp is probably telling the truth. Ten per cent think Heard is probably telling the truth. Fifty-one per cent are undecided. Some top celebrities sided with him too. Joe Rogan, host of Spotify’s controversial The Joe Rogan Experience, said that watching the trial was a “cautionary tale” about “believing in bullshit” and offered that the case was good for Depp, but not for Disney. “You got rid of the best fuckin’ pirate you ever had! For a crazy lady!” Others have fretted that the trial, coming soon after the Will Smith-Chris Rock Oscar slap, has bought the entire construct of Hollywood celebrity into disrepute – as a dissertation on fame as a personal curse – reenacted in a suburban courtroom. Derek Long, assistant professor of media and cinema studies at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said that “movie stardom culturally is less important than it used to be by virtue of the fact the media landscape is fractured and everyone constructs their own personal garden of interest”. Under Hollywood’s old studio system, somewhat reconstructed in the streaming era of Netflix, stars and their images were closely managed and protected by studio chiefs and publicity departments. There were scandals, from Fatty Arbuckle to Charlie Chaplin, or any number of others detailed in Kenneth Anger’s Hollywood Babylon book, but morality clauses and studio infrastructure had ways of managing it in the first place or at least the narrative of it in the press once it had occurred. “In a pre-#MeToo era there was more of an understanding that terrible things were going to happen and most of their efforts went into damage control, not prevention,” said Long. “Celebrity bad behavior, or scandal of any stripe, is a lot more in the open now and scandal has become a public part of popular discourse. “Stardom has always been about been about selling the sense that stars are just like us. Implicit in that commodification was good behavior – that stars are just like you at home, they bake cakes and use this or that brand of household cleaner. When all the bad behavior that goes along with stars being human beings, it disturbs people.”",Arts/Film,Depp v Heard: second week of trial takes sheen off celebrity glamor ,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/30/johnny-depp-amber-heard-trial-second-week
4/30/2022,"The war in Ukraine has made the Firth of Clyde busy again. We used to have neighbours – he died, she moved away – who could remember the view from their house when it was filled with shipping during the second world war: when big liners such as the Queen Mary and the Queen Elizabeth arrived, as my neighbours used to say, “as regular as clockwork”, packed with troops and supplies on their way to the D-day beaches from the ports of North America. There is nothing quite as momentous as that now. What happens more frequently is the humdrum arrival or departure of an oil tanker. Two or three tugs from Greenock will sail round the headland and take up their position in the channel; a large tanker will move slowly into view from the lower firth; the tugs will settle ahead, astern and abreast of the tanker; together the small convoy will head across Rothesay Bay towards the Nato jetty in Loch Striven. There, tanks submerged in the green hillside store oil. Merchant ships flying flags of convenience bring the oil in; navy tankers in various shades of warship grey take it away, presumably to Nato fleets exercising in the North Atlantic. Late last month a particularly imposing ship came and went from the jetty. I identified it from an online shipping movements site. It was the USNS Patuxent, 31,200 deadweight tonnes, an American “replenishment oiler” that could, like a giant sow, refuel two warships, one lying either side of it, at the rate of 3.6m litres of diesel an hour. I sent a photograph to a friend, and my friend wondered what would happen if she posted it on Instagram: what view would the authorities take, given the war in Ukraine? And I replied that the authorities – the Ministry of Defence, MI5 or whoever – would be entirely relaxed. A week or two before, the Royal Navy itself had published a video of one of its vast new aircraft carriers in the narrow waters of Loch Long, where it had gone to restock its armoury from the munitions dump in Glen Douglas. The idea, presumably, was to publicise British armed power. Other wars, not least the cold war, produced different behaviour. In the 1940s, when midget submarines and bouncing bombs were tested in Loch Striven, security men visited the few people who lived on its shores to make sure their curtains were closed. From the 1950s to the 1980s, aerial photographs that included the Clyde’s military infrastructure were marked “secret” or “restricted” and kept from public view. Even 10 years ago a car thought be loitering suspiciously on the roads near the nuclear submarine base in the Gare Loch (or its nuclear warhead-fitting facility in Loch Long) might be followed for a while, if only to give the watchers some practice in watching. It probably still happens. Even now, ship-tracking sites will record the movement of everything from a prawn dredger to a supertanker, though not a Trident submarine. In general, far more powerful and less obvious forms of surveillance have replaced the old restrictions and gumshoe techniques. Meanwhile the enemy, the potential target of the weaponry that the secrecy exists to protect, has become harder to define and describe. Is it just Vladimir Putin and the clique around him? Is it the Russian state? Is it a majority of the people who live in it? Does it include the music of Tchaikovsky or the Russian tennis players shunned by Wimbledon? Should the government’s newfound distaste for oligarchs extend to all of them, as ruthless looters of the Soviet people’s assets, or are some oligarchs better than others? I am shocked by my own ignorance. In the week that the Patuxent arrived in Loch Striven, the local Argyll paper carried a story about an oligarch’s superyacht that had been stranded in the Norwegian port of Narvik because dockworkers had refused to refuel it. The yacht, the Ragnar, was said by the paper to be owned by the Russian businessman Vladimir Strzhalkovsky, “a former KGB comrade of Russian dictator Vladimir Putin”, though as yet absent from the EU and UK lists of sanctioned oligarchs and also from the US’s much longer list of the possibly sanctionable. His house in Monaco is some way outside the Dunoon Observer and Argyllshire Standard’s core circulation area. What explains the paper’s interest in him is his son Evgeny’s purchase in 2017 of a country estate 10 miles from Dunoon. The estate, Knockdow, covers 250 acres of the Cowal peninsula and includes two lakes, two 2,000ft hills, a millpond, pastureland, a forest and an 18th-century mansion, Knockdow House, which has 12 bedrooms, six principal reception rooms and as its centrepiece a “glorious domed cupola”(Country Life) supported by Ionic columns. For two centuries it was one of the homes of the local gentry, the Lamonts, who like many prosperous families in the west of Scotland made at least some of their fortune from slave-worked sugar plantations in the Caribbean. Evgeny, whose employment is hard to discover but whose interests are yachting and re-enacting historic battles, is said to have paid £4m for it. His father is thought to be worth at least a hundred times that amount, after a short post-KGB career as the chief executive officer of Norilsk Nickel. You might say that the riches of the earth, cheaply and sometimes brutally harvested abroad, have kept the place going since the beginning. I can see the estate from our window, though the house itself is hidden behind a slope. It lies just three miles away across the water at the beginning of Loch Striven, but to reach there by any transport other than a small boat means a ferry crossing and a 40-mile drive: the Clyde estuary has a complicated geography. For that reason I’ve been there only once and never bothered to know it. It might have been the moon – this is what I mean by ignorance. Last month, looking at a plan of the estate, I saw that it surrounded the Nato jetty and its oil tanks on all three landward sides. In other words, the big grey ships come and go from a small square of MoD land that sits inside 250 acres bought by Evgeny Strzhalkovsky from funds that may well have been supplied by his father. Until recently, that might have served as an advertisement for globalisation – old enemies living together, outbreaks of peace. Today it looks like the outcome of a perplexing historical episode.
