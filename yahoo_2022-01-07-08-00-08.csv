 In an incident captured on video and shared on Twitter, a white woman attacks a Black man at a Hilton Hotel in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil. The incident allegedly happened after hotel staff served the Black man first, who was prioritized because he’s a Diamond member, before the White woman and her partner, according to the Daily Dot.

Durkin has a new job – white men get away with everything Honda Clocks Are Stuck 20 Years In The Past And There Isn't A Fix <em>Days Gone </em>Was A 'Disappointment' To Sony Despite Selling Millions, Director Says The video was taken by @monty_sexton, whose name is King on Twitter, and has been viewed over 800,00 times, liked over 15,000 times and retweeted over 5,000 times since it was posted on New Year’s Day. King has written to Hilton Hotels and as of Monday, Jan. 3, has received no response after reporting the incident. The Black man being attacked in the video is @slyfoxnyc, whose name is HL on Twitter, comments under the video claiming to be the Black man being attacked, “Can you please send the video to me so I can send to Hilton headquarters, because of this security failure the couple had the police waiting outside looking for me for hours I couldn’t stay at the hotel that night because they lied saying I attacked them. Thanks for recording.” The Daily Dot has a synopsis of what occurred in the video: The footage shows HL standing by a reception desk separated from the white couple by four people who appear to be hotel security guards. “Y’all haven’t de-escalated the situation because she’s still right there talking,” King can be heard saying, referring to the white woman. “Y’all are supposed to separate the party.” After some unintelligible shouting and arguing, the white woman broke apart from the staff and attacked HL, wrapping her hands around his head and pulling him away from the reception desk. He can be seen trying to break free from her hold, then he punched the white man. The white man fell to the ground and seemed to be knocked out. The security guards then attempted to restrain the white woman. Meanwhile, King can be heard repeatedly calling out that “everything is on camera.” In the video, HL described the couple as “drunk” and “rude.” The security guards’ efforts to subdue the white woman didn’t seem to work, and she came back into the video frame, pulling herself out of the guards’ grips. She approached her partner, who was still laying on the floor. Then she yanked off her purse and stomped back over to HL, who was still standing by the reception desk. The white woman tried to attack HL again, but security guards pulled her away. Another staffer led HL away. HL shook his head without saying anything as he walked away, but King questioned why the white woman was able to continue rampaging. “Where is y’all’s security?” he yelled. “Get her under control. Oh my god! I don’t understand this. This is crazy. Where’s y’all’s security? Because this is unacceptable. This is unacceptable.” The white woman broke away from the guards again and tried moving toward HL again. “And y’all still haven’t restrained her,” King yelled. The guards seemed to be trying to pull the woman down a hallway as the video ended. After the incident, HL stated he wasn’t allowed to stay at the hotel that night. First of all, if the allegations are true, why was she so angry that she wasn’t served first? I’m not the most patient person but attacking someone ahead of you because they’re being taken care of first? Wild. Secondly, why was the man who was attacked not allowed to stay at the hotel that night? One user felt the same way saying, “What do you mean YOU couldn’t stay at the hotel? What in ALL da fuqs??? @Hilton @HiltonHotels this you?” HL, the man who was attacked in the video, responded to the user saying, “Yes they came back with cops saying I attacked them waiting for hours outside the hotel with the police and @hilton wanted me to not encounter the police so I went and stayed at the Airbnb I also had rented, I was only staying at Hilton because I rented the venue for my NYE party.” According to the Daily Dot, a spokesperson for the hotel said he was allowed to stay the night if he chose to. But wait, it doesn’t end there. HL also tweeted that before the video, the couple tried to cut him in line and the woman’s partner called him the N-word. He did not allow for the couple to jump him in line. Not to mention which wasn’t on camera them pushing past me trying to cut the Diamonds member line and the husband referring to me as the Ni**er black guy after I refused to allow them to jump line and asked several times to stop invading my space stand 6ft back stop touching me — HL (@slyfoxnyc) January 3, 2022 “We are aware a video has been made public showing a portion of an altercation between guests at Hilton Rio De Janeiro Copacabana,” the Hilton Rio De Janeiro Copacabana spokesperson said, according to the Daily Dot.

1/7/2022,"Masina Tupea said she has never sprinted so fast in her life. “The guy took his chances with me cause he thought I would crumble again,” she wrote on Facebook. “He was wrong.” Tupea, along with her parents, was walking down the Central Business District to grab dinner in New Orleans while on vacation Tuesday, Dec. 28, when she says a man accosted her family, HawaiiNewsNow reported. Tupea said the man punched her mother in the face, dislocating her jaw. So Tupea sprung into action. Little did their alleged attacker know, the 18-year-old Hawaii native is a national deadlifting champion, setting a nearly 320-pound record nationwide, according to HawaiiNewsNow. “I needed to protect my family,” Tupea told NOLA. “That’s all I could think about.” She ran after the accused attacker once he decided to flee, according to Tupea, and he then turned around and hit her, too. Tupea said she reeled from the punch, which left her with a black eye, NOLA reported, but still continued to pursue the man. Once she caught up with him, she dodged his tackle and pinned him down under a car, trapping him, according to HawaiiNewsNow. The man pleaded with her to let him go, Tupea said, but she told him she wouldn’t. “He asked me to let him go, but I kept telling him that he messed with the wrong family,” she told HawaiiNewsNow. According to Tupea’s account of the incident, she didn’t release the man until she saw flashing police lights. Only then did she allow herself to return back to her parents, she said. Tupea said that while many people are calling her a hero, the entire situation had also stirred an onslaught of emotions, including when she returned to her parents crying. But overall, Tupea wrote, she was glad to discover what kind of person she became when her family was jeopardized — and that even if she gets hit, she can indeed stand back up. Police told NOLA they arrested Augustus Taylor, 36, accusing him of purse snatching and two counts of simple battery. According to NOLA, his bond is set at $40,000, and court records show Taylor has had numerous battery counts against him dating back to 2010. McClatchy News reached out to the New Orleans Police Department for comment. Tupea wrote she was grateful her attacker didn’t have a weapon — and that her family is still together. According to NOLA, the Tupeas were able to enjoy the rest of their vacation after a trip to the hospital to pop her mother’s jaw back into place. “Thank you for the outpouring of love and support that our family has received from across the country,” Tupea posted the week after the incident. “I love my family and I thank Heavenly Father that our family is recovering well (both physically and emotionally) and there weren’t any serious injuries.” Man accused of breaking into sleeping woman’s home left critical clue behind, NC cops say Rabbi got lighter sentence in massive fraud scheme due to CA synagogue attack, feds say Convicted Boston Marathon bomber got COVID relief money in prison, prosecutors say Elementary teacher accused of having hundreds of child porn photos, videos in NC home",U.S./Biloxi Sun Herald,Teen powerlifter tackles man attacking her mom during New Orleans trip. ‘His mistake’,https://news.yahoo.com/teen-powerlifter-tackles-man-attacking-200940770.html
1/7/2022,"Millions of viewers are learning about “tip baiting” for the first time, thanks to an Uber Eats driver’s viral video. The clip comes courtesy of TikToker @owenlindstrom, who’s built a substantial following for posting his daily experiences as an Uber Eats driver. One of his recent videos struck a very particular chord, as it sparked a wide-ranging debate about gig workers and tipping protocols. Those topics have played a major role on TikTok for quite some time, as delivery drivers often turn to the platform to share their experiences.  Recently, a DoorDash driver went viral after sharing the “secret” downside of delivering to apartment buildings. Before that, a driver explained how they mistakenly received an order request from over 700 miles away.  In @owenlindstrom1’s video, he describes “tip baiting” as one of the “worst things” a driver can encounter. Basically, the concept involves a customer including a large tip with their order, then changing the tip amount after their food arrives. As @owenlindstrom1 explains, customers might do this to encourage a driver to deliver their order more quickly.  “Unfortunately there’s not really anything you can do to fight it,” @owenlindstrom1 adds. “Because the customer holds all the power. That’s because, according to Uber Eats’ website, a tip can be edited up to an hour after the order arrives. The company adds that 100% of all tips go straight to the driver.  Shop In The Know cover star Storm Reid's high-fashion looks Many TikTokers wrote that they’d never heard of tip baiting, and some were outraged. “That’s messed up,” one user wrote. “If you have to reduce the tip after the fact, you should have to put a reason,” another added.  “This upsets me,” another wrote.   Others, however, argued that tip baiting isn’t the real problem. “Perhaps we shouldn’t be pre-tipping at all,” one user wrote.  “Tipping shouldn’t exist at all,” another added. “Just pay the workers properly.”  In the comments, @owenlindstrom1 wrote that he doesn’t believe tip baiting is “super common,” but added that it is frustrating when it happens.  Draya Michele takes home a $6K Chanel yellow mini handbag to add to her fashion collection If you liked this story, check out this article on a prank that divided TikTok.

1/7/2022,"Rep. Mark Finchem, presumably kitted up in his “full armor of God,” chose the anniversary of the Capitol insurrection to once again toss out the fantastical (and completely baseless) claim that Arizona’s vote was rigged. Isn’t that special? On a solemn day when the country marks the one-year anniversary of the appalling attack on democracy – after a year of looking high and low for fraud and not finding it – Finchem flatly, shamelessly claims that “tens of thousands” of votes in Maricopa and Pima counties were fraudulent. “The real insurrection was run by (then-Maricopa County Recorder Adrian) Fontes and (Secretary of State Katie) Hobbs in Maricopa and Pima on the run up to Nov 3rd and several days after where they rigged the vote in Arizona with tens of thousands of fraudulent votes in each of those counties,” he tweeted on Thursday. The real insurrection was run by Fontes and Hobbs in Maricopa and Pima on the run up to Nov 3rd and several days after where they rigged the vote in Arizona with tens of thousands of fraudulent votes in each of those counties. — Mark Finchem (@RealMarkFinchem) January 6, 2022 Of course, Finchem has no evidence of this because there isn’t any. In Maricopa County, a five-month audit turned up no fraud, only “anomalies” for which the Senate’s ninja auditors admitted there could be explanations. On Wednesday, after a three-month examination of the auditors’ claims, the Republican-controlled county provided those explanations. Mostly, that the auditors had “a basic misunderstanding or ignorance of election laws and procedures”. The county did, however, find that one of the auditors’ 75 findings was correct. Of 2.1 million votes cast in the 2020 election, there were 87 questionable ballots: 37 cases of potential fraud, mostly involving dead voters, and 50 ballots that were mistakenly counted twice. In Pima County, as in Maricopa, there has been no sighting of “tens of thousands” of phony ballots. Finchem is relying on an 14-month-old anonymous email, detailing an imagined plot by the Pima County Democratic Party to insert 35,000 phony votes into the system. The claims already have been investigated by Attorney General Mark Brnovich’s Elections Integrity Unit but no evidence was found. And still Finchem rages about a rigged election. But then, there are political fortunes to be made, points to be scored, money to be raised and to heck with the impact of spreading lies and sowing distrust in the very foundation of our way of life. Finchem is one of Arizona’s loudest leaders in Trump’s Stop the Steal brigade, an Oro Valley Republican who is hoping to howl his way into the Secretary of State’s Office so he can oversee elections in one of the country’s key swing states. It was Finchem who hosted that Nov. 30, 2020 “hearing,” during which Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani regaled the public with the many ways in which Arizona’s election was stolen. Giuliani spent all day presenting “expert” witnesses, not a single one of whom provided any actual evidence of fraud. Finchem, however, was undeterred. “Ladies and gentleman, this is a skirmish,” he declared at the end of that hearing. “You ain’t seen nothing yet. Because when Satan wants to extinguish a light, he will stop at nothing. So be on your guard, put on the full armor of God, and be prepared to fight.” In the weeks that would follow, Finchem promoted the Jan. 6 Stop the Steal protest at the nation’s Capitol. He was there one year ago, as the Trump mob broke into the Capitol, hoping to stop Joe Biden from becoming president. He even justified the deadly violence as ""what happens when the people feel they have been ignored"". He has spent the last year working to undermine voter confidence in elections – and boost his own political prospects – and it has thus far paid off. Trump has endorsed him, which is apparently, all that counts any more in the once-Grand Old Party. And now, on a day when all Americans should be reflecting on just how easily our democracy could crumble, there is Finchem, boldly braying on about a stolen election. It’s a lie and he knows it. Maybe if he loosened up that armor just a bit, he’d have room to grow a conscience. Reach Roberts at laurie.roberts@arizonarepublic.com. Follow her on Twitter at @LaurieRoberts.

1/7/2022,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexican authorities have arrested two suspects after an SUV filled with 10 bodies was left outside the office of a Mexican state governor in a public square lit up with Christmas tree and holiday decorations, officials said on Thursday.    David Monreal, governor of the central state of Zacatecas, said in a video filmed at the plaza that the car contained bodies of people with apparent signs of beating and bruising.    ""They came to leave them here in front of the palace,"" he said, referring to his offices in a centuries-old building at the Plaza de Armas of the state capital, also called Zacatecas.  Video: Mother in Mexico pleas to cartel leaders to stop threats Ceci Flores posted a video to social media to plead with Mexican cartel leaders to allow her to search for her two sons who disappeared in 2015 and 2019.

1/7/2022,"A married sheriff’s deputy who emigrated to the U.S. from Russia in 2007 has been implicated in the bizarre death of a champion speedskater who she claimed had wasted away after suddenly contracting mad cow disease. But friends of former Olympian Boris Leikin told The Daily Beast that they watched the super-fit athlete grow increasingly disoriented and frail while his supposed lover kept him isolated, refusing to let friends communicate with him before she allegedly stole his life savings. Marina Billings, 49, and her husband Robert, 70, are now charged with financial exploitation of a vulnerable adult and aggravated abuse of a vulnerable adult, the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office confirmed. They’re accused of fleecing Leikin of his Cottonwood Heights, Utah home and assets before he died mysteriously last July at the age of 69. Billings was raised in Siberia, where she reportedly owned an advertising agency, and became a booking deputy at the Bannock County, Idaho jail in 2014. She worked two jobs, at Wal-Mart and Denny’s, when she first arrived in America with her young daughter and said in a 2016 interview that she loved being a deputy because, “When I come to work…it’s like family. I know everybody will cover my back.” Billings (center) with her “hero,” Boris Leikin (left). She met Leikin last year, in a Facebook group for Russian speakers, according to a charging document obtained by The Daily Beast. A few months later, Leikin learned that Billings was married, the filing states. Still, Leikin told a friend that “he was in love with Marina, who is over 20 years his junior,” it says. Leikin was one of the oldest athletes to compete at the Olympic level, and set Masters world records in 2013 and 2014. In an online memorial, the International Masters' Speed Skating Committee noted Leikin’s participation in the U.S. Olympic trials in 1998, 2002, and 2005, at the age of 53. He eagerly mentored young skaters, and was said to be revered by those in the game. Leikin and Billings saw each other frequently, visiting each other in Utah and Idaho. But last spring, strange things started to happen to Leikin, who friends say had always been a paragon of health. Ule Archuletta, president of the Utah Masters Speed Skating League—where Leikin was a director—said he raced with Leikin in March. All appeared normal at the time, and Leikin was active at the skating club, training and coaching others. In May, while out for a hike with Leikin, Archuletta first realized that something was not right with his longtime skating partner. “Shortly after he met her, he started complaining about headaches and not being able to sleep, and then it just progressively got worse,” Archuletta told The Daily Beast. “It all seemed amiss because he was one of the top skaters in his age division in the world.” Billings was a big Trump fan, according to her now-deleted Instagram account. When he went over to Leikin’s house a couple of weeks later, Archuletta said Leikin “was weak, he couldn’t recognize the people who were there, and when I asked him who the president was, he laughed it off. But then he said, ‘I’m not sure.’” It “was basically like he had dementia,” said Archuletta. “And that’s when she moved into the house.” A day or two later, a concerned Archuletta stopped by Leikin’s house to check on him. But Billings refused to let Archuletta inside, he said, adding, “That’s when I called the police.” Others told a similar story once cops began digging in. A married couple that Leikin was friendly with told detectives that Leikin contacted them in early May and said he was experiencing unexplainable health issues. Within a few weeks, he had deteriorated to the point he was hospitalized.” The couple “attempted to make contact with Boris while he was hospitalized but were told that Marina had put restrictions on any persons having contact with Boris, other than herself, claiming that she was Boris’ fiancé [sic] and had power of attorney,” the charging document states. “According to hospital staff and social works [sic], they suspected Boris was severely neglected and he was in very serious condition. [The couple] stated that Boris had no family to advocate for him while he was being hospitalized, which was a great concern.” Further, Billings “informed Boris’ friends and neighbors that she was taking control of Boris’ finances while he was hospitalized,” according to the filing. Billings apparently had a taste for the finer things. Leikin was discharged from the hospital on May 28 and went home, where Billings said she would care for him. A woman who lived across the street from Leikin told investigators that Billings contacted her on May 30 and asked her to come over because “Boris wanted to adjust his will,” the charging document explains. When she got there, Billings told the neighbor and her husband “that Boris may have mad cow disease and was terminal.” An unknown “older man” was also there, who was later identified as Billings’ husband, Robert, who worked as an FBI electronics technician, according to public records. He said Leikin wanted to “change one line in his will,” according to the filing, which says the neighbor “watched as Marina put the pen in Boris’ hand, put the will document under the pen that Boris was holding, but Boris was not able to sign the will. Boris could not keep the pen on the line and sign his signature.” Eventually, Billings was able to get Leikin, whose hands were shaking uncontrollably, to sign the will. But he appeared unaware of what he was doing, said the neighbor, who subsequently told police that Billings was talking to Leikin “in a very peculiar way and described it as though she was treating him like [a] dog.” “Marina talked to me that weekend and asked if he had a will and all that, and later she [suddenly] had the will,” Archuletta told The Daily Beast. “There were a lot of things that did not add up.” Some of Billings’ online postings veered to the far-right. Leikin’s condition soon took a turn for the worse. On June 4, suffering the effects of dehydration and rapid weight loss, he was rehospitalized. “Doctors were concerned with Boris’ lack of care and Marina’s indifference to it,” says the charging document. Leikin died on July 6. Court papers do not specify if his death was attributed to bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or, mad cow disease. “He was a great guy, he had a magnetic personality, everyone who met him liked him,” Archuletta told The Daily Beast. “He had a lot of people who would come out and train with him, and he let them stay at his house. There's a list of Olympians who could tell you about Boris and everything he’s done for everybody in the community.” After Leikin’s death, a detective with the Cottonwood Heights Police Department reviewed his finances, according to the charging document. In late May, while Leikin was first hospitalized, Billings drafted a new will for Leikin, naming herself as beneficiary and executor, it says. She also drafted a codicil removing a close friend of Leikin’s as executor, which had been formalized in 2017. The couple “authored documents to completely take control of Boris’ property and assets” and signed them when Leikin’s “physical and mental condition was rapidly deteriorating,” the charging document says. In an interview with detectives, Billings insisted that it was Leikin who “wanted her to have guardianship and kept pushing her and Robert to get the Will drawn up,” and said Leikin wanted to leave his entire estate to her. Under separate questioning, Robert Billings admitted to detectives that he had drawn up the amended will Leikin signed, but claimed he only did so because “Boris expressed some concerns about caring for his elderly mother.” He also admitted taking a Ruger 9mm handgun from Leikin’s home “because they feared that Boris may use the gun on himself,” the charging document says. Robert claimed he didn’t have the will or any of the other alleged documents in his possession but when cops searched the Billings’ home in Idaho, they located a “secret room in the basement” with a large plastic file divider containing “copies of the Will, Power of Attorney, Trust, Medical Records for Boris’ treatment in Idaho and other paper documents.” When he first learned that Marina and Robert Billings had been arrested, Archuletta said he had one response: “Relief.” Billings on the job. Both were booked and released on $2,500 bail, Ben Haynes, a spokesman for the Salt Lake County D.A., told The Daily Beast. Murder charges have not been filed at this time. In an email, Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said, “We file charges based on the evidence. Marina and Robert Billings are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.” Police have not said if they believe Billings intentionally poisoned Leikin. Reached at her Pocatello, Idaho home by The Daily Beast, Marina Billings declined to discuss the situation or the charges she and her husband are facing. She said to direct all inquiries to her lawyer, but hung up when asked for her attorney’s name. A neighbor who lives a few doors down from the couple told The Daily Beast that they are “pretty private people.” “The few times that we’ve talked to her, she’s been really nice,” said the neighbor, who asked that he not be identified. “But I don’t know that anybody in the neighborhood really knows them. They keep pretty much to themselves.” Following the charges, Marina Billings was placed on administrative leave by the Bannock County Sheriff’s Office, Sheriff Tony Manu said in a statement. “Billings will remain on administrative leave while the County conducts an internal investigation regarding Bannock County policies,” the statement said. “The Bannock County Sheriff’s Office expects the highest professional conduct of its employees both on-and off-duty, which includes conformance to laws.” Read more at The Daily Beast.
