4/26/2022,"Photographs found on a phone showing the torture of a woman believed to be a Moroccan-Dutch drug smuggler nicknamed the “Godmother of the Coke” have been added to the prosecution’s evidence against a suspected drug kingpin in his trial in Amsterdam for multiple murders. Three disturbing images of a woman who bears a close resemblance to Naima Jillal, who disappeared in 2019, were reportedly found on a BlackBerry when Ridouan Taghi was arrested three years ago in Dubai. According to Het Parool, a Dutch newspaper, the pictures have recently been added to the evidence against Taghi in the so-called Marengo case, in which he and 16 others are accused of organising six murders between 2015 and 2017. Speaking to Het Parool, Taghi’s lawyer, Inez Weski, said the prosecution had no basis on which to link the phone or the gruesome images to Taghi, a Moroccan-Dutch national who was the Netherlands’ most wanted man before his arrest. She said: “It cannot be stated that this phone can be linked to my client. So that link and origin are not fixed. It has been reported in the media before that such photos were going around. Moreover, all this has nothing to do with the alleged facts. It is very remarkable that this has been brought out in this way.” The long-running Marengo trial, the name of which was picked randomly by a computer, has revealed the extraordinary scale and severity of the violence around the narcotics gangs operating in the Netherlands. It has also been marked by the murder of figures linked to the prosecution’s chief witness, a former gang member turned informant, called Nabil B. The witness’s brother was murdered in 2018, and a separate trial of three men suspected of shooting dead his former lawyer Derk Wiersum began last year. Nabil B’s sometime spokesperson, the journalist Peter R de Vries was killed on the streets of Amsterdam in 2021. When Taghi was arrested in 2019 in Dubai, he was reportedly described by the city’s police chief as “one of the world’s most dangerous and wanted men”. Jillal, who was 54 when she disappeared, was known as the Godmother of the Coke or Tante Jillal (Aunt Jillal) in the criminal underworld. She was last seen getting into a car near her home on Gustav Mahlerlaan in Amsterdam at around 9.30pm on Sunday 20 October 2019 but her family said she had not been seen or heard of since.",News/World news,Torture photos added to evidence in trial of alleged Dutch drug kingpin,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/26/torture-photos-added-to-evidence-in-trial-of-alleged-dutch-drug-kingpin
4/26/2022,"For Dr Dmytro*, who has worked as a cardiologist in Lviv for 13 years, few crosses are harder to bear than the death of a child – the loss of a patient whose life still lay before them – even when he knows there is nothing more he could have done. But while all children’s deaths weigh heavily on his mind, the avoidable loss of Andriy, a one-week-old baby who died because of a shortage of X-ray machines, is one Dmytro still struggles to reconcile. Andriy was born in Lviv in March with congenital heart disease, and urgently needed an angiogram, a specialist X-ray that allows a doctor to see a patient’s blood vessels. But with only one angiography machine shared between several hospitals in Lviv, and as the western Ukrainian city copes with an influx of people fleeing Russian attacks in the east and around Kyiv, waiting times for specialist medical equipment have risen. In Andriy’s case, the delay was fatal. “It destroyed me as a doctor,” Dmytro says. “He should have lived; it wasn’t the condition that killed him. This is a kid who should go to school, make friends, play football. And it destroys you, especially when you understand what could have solved this problem – and that’s another angiography machine.” According to UN agency the International Organization for Migration, more than 7.1 million people have been internally displaced in Ukraine since Russia invaded six weeks ago, and hundreds of thousands have fled to the relative safety of western Ukraine, which has so far been spared the brunt of the violence. The result is that hospitals in Lviv – the largest city in the region and its unofficial capital – are under increasing strain as they become medical hubs for the entire country. As well as serving the everyday needs of its growing population and those wounded in fighting elsewhere, Lviv’s hospitals have also absorbed patients with chronic and complex conditions who have been transferred from hospitals in frontline cities such as Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol. Hospitals in those cities have also been directly targeted. For this reason hospitals in this article cannot be named ; doctors are also referred to by their first names only for security. And as Russia marked the start of its renewed eastern offensive with missile strikes that also targeted infrastructure in western Ukraine, there are fears the region could soon be further overwhelmed with its own casualties of war. As medical departments shut down in the east, many doctors also moved west, bolstering the workforce in Lviv. But equipment was left behind or destroyed, and while Lviv’s hospitals have enough doctors to treat the new patients, in some cases they are finding themselves without the means to do so. Dr Zoryana, who works at a children’s hospital in Lviv, says: “Patients with chronic conditions, congenital malformations, cardiac surgery patients, neurosurgery patients, injuries from war – all severe pathologies are now coming here, because we are now one of the only centres that can manage such patients. “We lack particular supplies and equipment, because we are not used to having so many severe patients. And that’s a real problem at the moment.” In Zoryana’s hospital, for example, there is only one monitor to measure the vital signs of patients in intensive-care units (ICU). “We have the doctors to do three major operations a day, but we cannot do that because we only have one monitor. So we are only doing one a day and then waiting until the child is quite stable to give that monitor to the next,” she says. As she talks outside the hospital, ambulances with Polish and British number plates arrive, full of privately donated medical supplies: bandages, morphine, saline kits, feeding tubes. Yet the more acute challenge is acquiring specialist equipment such as the angiography machine, which cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, that could have saved Andriy’s life. “Before the war, we performed around 30 angiography procedures each month, but in the past month, we had 66 patients,” says Dmytro. “If the [operating] table is busy, heart attack or stroke patients have a much higher chance of dying or having neurological deficits … An extra hour can increase the mortality risk by 20%.” Dr Denis, who fled his home in Dnipro and is now medical director of anaesthetics and intensive care at the children’s hospital, a workplace that also doubles as his new home, says they need “specialist equipment: ventilator units, ICU beds, syringe pumps, high-level monitoring systems, ECMO [life-support] machines.” But he adds that it is not just quantity, but quality, that can make the difference between life and death. Using old Soviet-era devices that were in storage can lead to missed diagnoses, riskier procedures and longer operating times. Ukraine’s defence minister recently called on “partnering states” to upgrade the country’s Soviet-era weapons with modern ones used by Nato, in order to survive the new onslaughtin the east. “If they will open the humanitarian corridors, we can’t even imagine how many casualties we will take just from one city,” says Denis. “What we ask from Nato is not soldiers – close the sky [to Russian warplanes] and give us modern ammunition, machinery and equipment. We have enough people ready to be deployed. And we have a lot of weapons, but from the Soviet Union. “It’s the same situation in hospitals. Give us modern equipment, and modern medical supplies. Our doctors are well trained, they can do a lot of high-level operations.” But for some doctors, the biggest challenge is wounds that Nato-provided equipment cannot heal. “Every doctor must be a psychologist now,” says Dr Ivan, a fresh-faced graduate whose first day of work in the children’s hospital was the day before war broke out. “People are emotionally closed, like a shell,” he says. “Maybe the worst thing is to see in people’s eyes, children’s eyes – nothing.” * Only first names have been used to protect the doctors’ identities.

4/26/2022,"Welcome to The Breakdown, the Guardian’s weekly (and free) rugby union newsletter. Here’s an extract from this week’s edition. To receive the full version every Tuesday, just pop your email in below. If rugby union’s much-vaunted values were ever to be written down as commandments then “thou shall not speak ill of the referee” would be chief among them. It can border on sanctimonious at times but the referee must be treated with the utmost respect and there is no place for criticism, however much it feels justified. To many it is a cornerstone of the sport but, like much of the game, it is beginning to feel antiquated. The issue has flared up in New Zealand recently because two senior All Blacks, Ardie Savea and Aaron Smith, have had the temerity to question refereeing decisions in post-match interviews. Neither said anything that warranted further investigation by the authorities but that has not stopped the union from acting, as New Zealand’s team manager, Chris Lendrum, revealed: “We have raised particular matters around post-match comments with teams.” Suffice it to say that the next time Savea or Smith is interviewed shortly after a match they are unlikely to be so forthcoming. In the northern hemisphere it is an ongoing issue too. The standard of officiating in the United Rugby Championship is much maligned, so much so that the head of match officials, Tappe Henning, recently hosted a press conference, urging patience and acknowledging mistakes were being made with differing interpretations by referees in Europe and South Africa at least part of the problem. In the Premiership, it is a more familiar sight to see players marched back for backchat these days and evidently the Rugby Football Union is eager to clampdown on criticism or what it perceives as abuse. Two high-profile incidents include the punishment of the Northampton director of rugby, Chris Boyd, for comments made about the referee Adam Leal in January and the reprimanding earlier in the season of Anthony Watson for a tweet about a decision in Bath’s defeat by Wasps. The disciplinary panel overseeing the Watson case in November heard from the Rugby Football Referees’ Union, which highlighted concerns over the acute shortage of match officials at grassroots level following the pandemic-enforced layoff. It is an issue to which the RFU is paying keen attention because numbers have been dwindling and, as the old saying goes, there is no game without the referee. Furthermore, just last week Wayne Barnes gave an impassioned and eloquent speech at the Rugby Union Writers’ Club anniversary lunch addressing the issue of criticism and abuse of officials and highlighting the plight of Nic Berry, the Australian referee lambasted by Rassie Erasmus during last summer’s British & Irish Lions tour of South Africa. It should be noted that Erasmus significantly overstepped the mark but equally he has swathes of supporters who feel he had every right to vent his frustrations. Not long after Barnes’s address, Lawrence Dallaglio made a similarly heartfelt plea, urging governing bodies to raise the game’s profile and pointing out the absence of superstar names within the sport. That can only be achieved, however, if players are allowed to speak their minds. The key is to distinguish between players and coaches being vocal and vitriolic, because to prevent them from being candid is a dangerous route to take at a time when the sport is desperate for those very people to express themselves. That is not to say that they can only show their personalities by berating referees, but all too often in rugby union it feels as if the players are hung out to dry. It is an authoritarian move to attempt to stamp out constructive or justified criticism of officials entirely. To err is human and all that but just as players are suffering the consequences of harsher penalties for high tackles – as seen with the recent flurry of red cards – when the margins are so small, so too should referees be held to account. If players speaking out against officials is happening more often, social media has given supporters the platform to vent spleen. That is, unfortunately, not going to go away any time soon but there are ways the sport can help itself because, for a large section of the more fair-minded rugby public, criticism tends to be born out of confusion. In other words the issue is less that they disagree with a certain decision, more that they do not understand why it has been made. Take the incident involving Calum Green and Joe Marler on Saturday as an example. Green made contact with Marler’s head shortly before the interval in Harlequins’ victory over Leicester but ultimately Barnes, in consultation with the TMO Tom Foley, ruled that the prop had been pushed, or “accelerated” into contact by his teammate Alex Dombrandt and that was the offence that ought to be punished. The end result was a Leicester penalty. Viewers at home were informed that World Rugby is attempting to clamp down on players being propelled into contact by their teammates and a similar incident took place hours later in the United Rugby Championship clash between the Sharks and Leinster. Viewers were also privy to the conversation that took place between Barnes and Foley – informative and concise in equal measure. Those in the stadium, however, were none the wiser. Premiership Rugby has made a point of acknowledging that it needs to do better in explaining the “why” in its decision-making, using the example of Ealing’s recent failure to gain promotion to the top flight. Senior figures acknowledge the need to explain its reasoning better, to show its working, but the same logic could be applied to on-field decisions and it does not feel like too much to ask for those in the stadium to be given the same level of information as those watching on television. Criticism, whether from players, coaches or supporters is never going to stop but an understanding and an explanation of why decisions are being made may just help distinguish between the reasonable and the downright rude.",Sport/Sport,The Breakdown | Why players should not be silenced on refereeing issues in rugby union,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/26/why-players-should-not-be-silenced-on-refereeing-issues-in-rugby-union-breakdown
4/26/2022,"In January, Neil Young gave Spotify an ultimatum: it’s me or Joe Rogan. The streaming giant picked Rogan, the comedian who was accused of spreading vaccine misinformation on his podcast. Days later, compilations of the presenter using the N-word emerged online and he apologised. Spotify stood by Rogan, on whom they had reportedly spent $200m locking into a three-and-a-half-year contract. Young’s protest marked the first time many had heard of Rogan’s libertarian podcast, despite it having an estimated 11 million listeners. The vast network of US rightwing comedy – from podcasts and television to YouTube and live standup – needs to be taken seriously, say Matt Sienkiewicz and Nick Marx, authors of That’s Not Funny: How the Right Makes Comedy Work for Them. The pair spent months researching rightwing comedy, concluding that whether or not you’re laughing, you can’t ignore its influence. “What first breaks through as a joke may well show up later as part of a political platform,” they write. “The increasingly influential world of rightwing comedy provides cover and succour to those inclined toward the ugliest of ideologies.” It’s a phenomenon noted in Louis Theroux’s recent BBC series Forbidden America, where he met streamers Baked Alaska and Nick Fuentes. Both are accused of racism and misogyny, Fuentes has shared “jokes” about Holocaust denial and told Theroux he doesn’t believe women should be able to vote. Both also use comedy as a defence when challenged on their most abhorrent views. Many viewers had never heard of the men, but as Theroux told a press conference: “they already have access to hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of [people] by dint of the internet … this phenomenon exists in the world, and by not reporting on it, it’s not going to go away.” Sienkiewicz, associate professor of communication and international studies at Boston College, and Marx, associate professor of film and media studies at Colorado State University, became interested in the topic when they noticed Fox News hosts were increasingly looking for laughs. “I was guilty of the denial that we identify: this thing can’t be funny because it doesn’t align with my political beliefs, therefore I’ll define it as something else,” says Marx. “But this was meant to be funny to my political opposition, and to call it something else was dishonest and counterproductive.” Following the trail from Greg Gutfeld, whose Fox News show Gutfeld! was by 2021 attracting a larger viewership than Stephen Colbert’s CBS satire The Late Show, the pair discovered that rightwing satirists, podcasters and standups were all connected in a new comedy ecosystem. They featured on each other’s podcasts, TV shows and social media feeds, sharing ideas and audiences. Sienkiewicz and Marx traced a spectrum of comedy – from what was shown on network TV and the religiously tinged satire of the Babylon Bee (a sort of Christian version of the Onion), to podcasters Legion of Skanks (whose regular segment “Who’s more justified?” sees hosts debate who should be allowed to use racial slurs), trolls such as Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes and antisemitic podcasters the Daily Shoah. Many are masters of Reddit-style trolling and meme-making, helping them reach vast internet audiences, often the younger demographics that the Republican party and Fox News covet. Comedy, says Marx, is “a powerful recruitment tool”. These young men are attractive to advertisers too, helping Rogan and others make money but also incentivising comedians to develop brands built on shock tactics. Connections between the comedians mean a Gutfeld fan can find something darker within a few clicks. Someone like Gutfeld “might have a guest who doesn’t say anything that points to their racism. But if you refer to the guest’s podcast, you find it,” says Sienkiewicz. “You get passed along this pathway where the absolute fringe is not as disconnected as we thought.” As those researching conspiracy theories point out, the online algorithms dictating what people consume next are powerful. The united front of rightwing comedians is another reason to pay attention. “They are much better than the left at uniting behind a shared goal,” Marx says. “They all reference and ridicule the ‘woke left’, claiming, ‘You can’t say this any more’”, says Sienkiewicz. Marx adds: “There’s great boundary-pushing left and liberal comedy, but the right’s project is to make it seem like the left has collapsed into a humourless gaggle of self-censoring.” “Comedy does not have a political orientation,” says Sienkiewicz. “The comedy industry has had an orientation towards centre-left. A vibrant and adventurous comedic left is a political advantage, but one that can be given away if the left gets squeamish about taking chances.” Could the UK create rightwing comedians with a comparable influence to the US? A BBC Radio 4 pilot recently featured some of the comics who have appeared on GB News. “The economics of particularly the podcasting industry probably mirrors ours,” says Sienkiewicz. “I’m confident that people like Rogan have a strong listenership there. Success breeds mimicry.”  That’s Not Funny: How the Right Makes Comedy Work for Them is published on 3 May by University of California Press.",Arts/Stage,‘Comedy is a powerful recruitment tool’: how the US rightwing use laughs for vast influence,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/26/comedy-is-a-powerful-recruitment-tool-how-the-us-rightwing-use-laughs-for-vast-influence
4/26/2022,"On the penultimate day of January, Sarina Bolden scored the final penalty in a shootout that gave the Philippines victory over Taiwan, a place in the semi-final of the Women’s Asian Cup and – the biggest prize of all – automatic qualification to the 2023 Women’s World Cup. This is the first time a Philippines team of any gender at any age level will appear on the global stage. As spot-kicks go then, it was a big one and the sight of the ball hitting the back of the net in the Indian city of Pune is one that the team’s coach, Alen Stajcic, will never forget. “It was pretty hard to describe – it was a special feeling,” the Australian, who took over last October, says. “Even though that had been the goal deep down for a lot of the players, it was still unexpected for them. It was great seeing people, people who had been there for a long time, celebrate something special.” One of those celebrating was Mariano Araneta, the president of the Philippine Football Federation. “The achievement of the women’s team can be a gamechanger for the sport here,” he says. “It really goes beyond qualifying for the World Cup. It has given us renewed hope and has inspired all stakeholders to further develop the game.” Just being there is a big deal, as is the prospect of the nation’s sporting attention being focused on events in Australia and New Zealand in July and August 2023. The Philippines are an outlier in south-east Asia, the only nation in the region of about 650 million people where football is not the number one sport. It has long been said that, in a sporting sense, this former colony of the United States is all about the ‘three Bs’: basketball, billiards and boxing. Whether all three are still as popular is debatable but it is clear that basketball is the first love of many in the sprawling archipelago. “The market of football isn’t as big as other sports like basketball or women’s volleyball and this historic achievement has an impact on our efforts to promote the game,” Araneta says. “It’s a huge achievement and a product of years of hard work and sacrifice not just from this team but all the teams in the past that paved the way for this squad.” Sign up for our new and free women’s football newsletter! It is important that the game takes advantage of the World Cup in the next 12 months and more. Stajcic, a former coach of the Australia women’s team, knows that such an appearance can make a crucial difference in a competitive sporting market. “Football in some countries like Australia and the USA is not the number one sport,” he says. “Here, basketball is more popular but being at the World Cup gives football a bit of presence and raises the expectation of what can be achieved. No team has qualified for any World Cup and that is something you can’t go back from and it really raises the bar.” Stajcic remembers how Australia’s men returning to the World Cup in 2006 after a gap of 32 years boosted the country’s fledgling A-League. “It really helps the local league; being there has an impact like no other impact and not just for football people but those who are sport mad and those who love the country.” For the first time, Filipinos around the world can watch their country against the best. “They had record television ratings for our matches, they were televised and that is not usually the case,” Stajcic says. “I heard that there were over 300,000 viewers for our final match at the Asian Cup and that shows the impact. The World Cup could have 10 times more.” Any kind of success – a win or even a draw – would be a massive deal, though Stajcic is trying to keep feet on the ground. After all, the Philippines are ranked 54 in the world by Fifa and are 11th in Asia. “Nobody is under any illusions,” says the 48-year-old, adding that the team, as one of the lowest seeds, will be handed a tough draw. “We will be in Pot Four and could play one of the USA, England, Italy or Brazil. It’s going to be extremely tough in every minute of every match but you never know in football.” A decade and a half of experience in the women’s game will help. “I’ve been around and I know the standard but I also know how miraculous the achievement is.” To have a similar jump in results over the next few months would be very welcome and the Philippines do have one small advantage in Stajcic’s knowledge of Australia and New Zealand. “I know the infrastructure, the facilities and all the people. In terms of logistics and planning, knowing what we can expect is a big advantage. Usually you have to go and scout but to have it at my own doorstep should make a difference.”",Sport/Football,Philippines Women make World Cup history – in shadow of ‘the three Bs’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/26/philippines-women-make-world-cup-history-in-shadow-of-the-three-bs
4/26/2022,"Scott Morrison has refused to explain the consequences if Australia’s “red line” regarding a Chinese military base on Solomon Island is crossed, with the Coalition under sustained political pressure on national security. The prime minister also struggled on Tuesday to land a response to Labor’s pledge to restore Australia’s influence in the Pacific, insisting the opposition’s announcement was largely an extension of Coalition policies while ridiculing the push for greater regional broadcasting. The Coalition wants the primary focus of the campaign to be on economic management but Morrison is instead mired in controversy about the consequences of a new security agreement between China and Solomon Islands. National security, like the economy, is considered an electoral strength for the Coalition, but the security deal in the Pacific has generated public debate about Morrison’s competence. A sustained focus on China’s influence in the region is also uncomfortable for Liberal MPs in electorates with large Chinese-Australian communities. Labor sought to seize the political initiative on Tuesday, declaring the security pact was another example of “a prime minister who talks a big game but has delivered so little and dropped the ball when it comes to the Pacific”. The opposition pledged that, if elected on 21 May, it would increase foreign aid to the Pacific by $525m over four years, while also deploying a range of soft and hard power measures and economic initiatives. Labor’s line of attack on the Coalition was backed up by Morrison’s predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull, who told ABC radio: “This is a hose you have to hold, this needs time and attention. You cannot abrogate or step away from responsibility.” Morrison declared on Sunday that Australia and the US shared the same “red line” when it came to opposing a Chinese military base on Solomon Islands.

He said it “would not be responsible for me to speculate in public about what Australia, United States and others would be doing in circumstances such as that”. In August 2012, then US president Barack Obama declared the Assad regime using chemical weapons in the Syrian conflict would be a “red line” for his administration. Assad stepped over the red line, and Obama failed to enforce his threat, in an episode widely considered the most significant foreign policy blunder of his presidency. The foreign minister, Marise Payne, was similarly non-committal when pressed on Sunday’s red line declaration. Payne told the ABC that Australia was “pleased” with Manasseh Sogavare’s assurances that Solomon Islands would not allow a military base. In response to a question about how Morrison’s red line would be enforced, she said: “Ultimately we would, of course, consult with other partners were that to happen, and we work every day to ensure that it does not happen.” Morrison said Australia’s relationship with Solomon Islands sought to “empower them”, and in a clear criticism of China’s motives, he added: “We don’t want to see that compromised by countries coming in from outside the region which have other agendas other than the advancement of the national security and the peace and the prosperity of those countries.” He also rounded on the Pacific policy Labor unveiled on Tuesday. The prime minister chose to ridicule the pledge to expand regional broadcasting into the Pacific. Morrison told 2GB the opposition’s “answer to solving the Solomon Islands problem is to have Q&A in Honiara”. He later told reporters in Townsville: “What they are effectively saying is they will keep doing what we have been doing. There is one difference. I sent in the AFP, the Labor party wants to send in the ABC when it comes to their Pacific solution.” The ABC is one of Australia’s most trusted institutions, but attacks on the ABC are popular with elements of Morrison’s conservative base. Two months after the Coalition was rebuked by current and former national security officials for weaponising a divide on China policy, Morrison said: “They are playing politics with the Pacific and the only ones who are benefiting from Labor’s attacks on the government is the Chinese government and it would seem the ABC.” The shadow minister for home affairs, Kristina Keneally, dismissed Morrison’s line of attack regarding the ABC. Keneally said Pacific nations “should hear Australian voices and not the Chinese Communist party”. In a broader attack on the Coalition’s national security credentials, Keneally dismissed “hairy chested, chest-thumping rhetoric from a prime minister who talks a big game but has delivered so little and it dropped the ball when it comes to the Pacific”. “The only reason the prime minister is out there talking about redlines is because he dropped the ball already,” she told ABC TV. Some Coalition members responded to Labor’s Pacific policy by saying it was “not really clear how it’s any different to what the government is already doing”. Payne characterised it as “a list of continuations, carbon copies and cosmetic changes” and said the Coalition already took a “whole-of-government approach”. She said the government was spending $2.7bn in the Pacific this year. But after emphasising that amount, the foreign minister also questioned whether more aid spending would have the effect implied by Labor. James Paterson, the head of parliament’s intelligence and security committee, was also asked on Tuesday to elaborate on the consequences of crossing the red line. “Well, it means we regard it as a very serious thing indeed … and we join with our allies in the United States and others in making that statement,” Paterson told Sky News. “It would be a very, very significant development and we would have to respond.” Pressed on the nature of the response, Paterson said it would “not be responsible” to canvass the details publicly. “All I can say is, backing in the prime minister, that we would take it very seriously and we would have to respond.”",News/Australia news,Morrison silent on ‘red line’ for China as Labor continues attack over handling of the Pacific,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/26/morrison-silent-on-red-line-for-china-as-labor-continues-attack-over-handling-of-the-pacific
4/26/2022,"There will be a “substantial gap” in UK agriculture’s efforts to reach net zero if post-Brexit environment-friendly subsidies are delayed by another two years, according to new analysis. The National Farmer’s Union (NFU) is urging the government to delay Environmental Land Management schemes (Elms) until 2025 and keep the EU’s Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) in the interim period, which pays farmers for the amount of land they own, regardless of its impact on the environment. Representatives say this is to provide some stability during a tumultuous time for UK farmers, with the price of fertiliser rocketing due to the Ukraine war, Covid-related staff shortages, the departure of EU seasonal workers, and other Brexit-related issues. Labour’s shadow Defra secretary, Jim McMahon, has backed the NFU’s stance. However, analysis by the thinktank Green Alliance shows that delaying Elms – the main means of helping farmers decarbonise – would see agricultural emissions savings in 2035 at half what they could have been if the Elms programme was delivered on time. Because emissions savings are cumulative, this would put more pressure on other areas to decarbonise even faster to make up for this loss, leaving a “substantial gap in the UK’s net zero plans”, according to the report. Agriculture, forestry and other land use needs to cut emissions by a quarter by 2030 and a third by 2035, according to the government’s proposed net zero pathway. “The flagship Elms programme is responsible for a third of farming emissions cuts,” said Dustin Benton, policy director at Green Alliance, and author of the report. “Rather than supporting the UK’s leading farmers to make their farms more sustainable, in the way the government promised during the Brexit process, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is dragging its heels six years after the referendum. “Delaying reforms of farming payments by another two years would put the UK’s climate targets at risk and undermine a transition that the UK’s best farmers have already invested in. Much better for Defra to get on with helping farmers build a nature positive, carbon negative food system ahead of the competition.” The Green Alliance report argues that for small and less profitable farms, the rapidly rising price of diesel and fertiliser increases the case for a rapid shift away from BPS. “Reducing inputs like fertiliser increased profit [for these farms] even before the recent price spike,” the report says. “Many of these farms are well endowed with natural capital but not well endowed with high-yielding land for food production. If these small farms were paid for the public goods [in the form of nature] they can improve on their farms, it would likely increase their farm profitability compared to BPS.” The original Elms start date was 2020, and delays have already been criticised by the public accounts committee. In February, NFU leader Minette Batters slammed the government for “repeatedly running into crises” through the absence of post-Brexit planning for the industry, saying it showed a “total lack of understanding of how food production works”. Many farmers are reported to have little trust in the government to manage the transition. NFU senior countryside adviser Claire Robinson said: “British farmers are committed to making their contribution to tackling the climate crisis, with an ambition to reach net zero by 2040. However, the conflict in Ukraine has set the costs of food production soaring across the world, and we need to give businesses the confidence to continue producing our food. “Continuing with BPS reductions originally planned would take away what is for many farmers their only lifeline, and when the replacement is not yet ready. A short delay to BPS reductions will give farmers and the government more time to work together to deliver durable schemes and policies that match our ambition to become a global leader in climate-friendly food and farming.” Farming minister Victoria Prentis told the Guardian Defra will not be delaying the implementation of Elms. “Area-based subsidy gave half the farming budget to 10% of landowners. BPS did not support food production, and did nothing to stop the decline in nature. We must seize the opportunity to establish a different system of rewards and incentives in agriculture – and I am pleased that we are supporting farmers with the choices that they make for their own holdings.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,"UK could miss net zero target if eco-friendly farming scheme is delayed, warns report",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/26/uk-miss-net-zero-target-eco-friendly-farming-elms-scheme-delayed-report-aoe
4/26/2022,"How does he do it all? Elon Musk is a father of seven, a busy businessman, a would-be coloniser of Mars and a full-time internet troll. As if he didn’t have enough on his plate, the world’s richest and most attention-seeking man has also just reached a deal to buy Twitter for $44bn. Not content with simply spending an inordinate amount of time posting puerile jokes on the platform, he is now seizing the memes of production. But don’t worry: it is not just a vanity project, it’s “philanthropy”. Musk has explained that he is buying Twitter to protect free speech and civil liberties. “Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,” Musk said in a statement posted to his new toy. If you are a billionaire, Twitter may be a digital town square where existential matters are debated, but for most users it is more like a school playground that the bullies have taken over. I have been using Twitter for more than a decade. In that time, it has gone from being a joyful place populated by brilliant, witty people to being an awful cesspit full of Nazis and killjoys. Rightwingers will harass you for being a woman with an opinion. Leftwingers will harass you for being a woman with the wrong sort of opinion. (I had to lock my account after suggesting that demisexuals – people who are not sexually attracted to others unless they have a strong emotional bond – are not the most oppressed people on the planet.) Twitter has become an objectively horrible place, yet I can’t seem to quit it. I am helplessly addicted. The joy has been sucked out of the platform, but it remains a uniquely efficient way to hear a variety of opinions on a variety of subjects. Plus, it remains a place where you are expected to have a presence if you want a career in the media. Is it possible that Musk will make Twitter great again? The right certainly thinks so. There has been a lot of jubilation from conservatives about Musk’s acquisition; they seem to believe a billionaire buying a social network is a win for free speech and a rebuke to big tech. (No one does mental gymnastics like a conservative.) Liberals are not so enthused. Various people, including the actor Jameela Jamil, have vowed, on Twitter, that they will quit the site as soon as Musk takes over. They won’t, of course. Because, as I said, the sort of people who care that Musk is taking over Twitter are also the sort of people who are hopelessly addicted to it. It is important to put Musk’s acquisition into perspective. He is not taking over a socialist cooperative that fosters the best in public discourse. He is taking over a hellhole that is owned mainly by institutional investors and whose founder is now a billionaire. That said, it is important that we don’t minimise the harm Musk could unleash as the head honcho at Twitter. Musk is notoriously thin-skinned, yet he likes to describe himself as a “free-speech absolutist”. It seems highly likely that he will unravel what little content moderation there is at Twitter, making life harder for minorities, who are disproportionally harassed on the platform. You know what else Musk will probably do? Let Donald Trump back on Twitter. Trump insisted on Monday that he has absolutely no interest in rejoining Twitter, but that is hard to believe. The former president’s new social network, Truth Social, has been a complete disaster and his relevance has plummeted since being kicked off Twitter. If Trump has any hope of making a political comeback, then Musk is his best bet. I have no idea how Musk’s acquisition of Twitter will pan out, but it looks as if the trolls will inherit the Earth.
