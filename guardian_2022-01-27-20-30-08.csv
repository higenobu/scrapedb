1/27/2022,"Book now Short stories are a funny thing. While technically shorter in length than novels or novellas, they have the power to hold just as much detail, world and story as their larger counterparts. This can make them tricky to construct, as they need to communicate character, tension, conflict and resolution.  If you enjoy reading short stories, or have turned your hand at writing them but would value some expert guidance, this course with Shelley Weiner is your tonic. Over four intense and stimulating virtual sessions, she will draw on her wealth of experience as an author, mentor and creative writing tutor, to guide and inspire you through the process. Through close examination of a selection of both classic and contemporary short stories, paired with practical exercises, you will identify - and demystify - the techniques used by great exponents of the genre, and learn how to craft your own stories. You’ll see your ideas through from generation to conception, building your structure, finding and amplifying your voice, and shaping your plot. During each live lesson, selected texts will be used as springboards to guide you through the aspect of craft under discussion. In week one, you’ll be given a jumping off point for a new story and will grow and develop it over the course. What is a story? From Aesop’s Fables to Cat Person, there are distinctive features that bind and also distinguish them. Discover the concept of story ideas and where to find them, with an introduction to character as the driving force in fiction. A deeper dive into character and dialogue, and how - and why - these components are core to story development. Looking into plot and momentum, including causality, structure, the pressure of time and more. Who tells the story? Viewpoints and voice will be looked at, as well as how to get your words onto the page, and how to find your readers. Over the course of four weeks, you’ll have the opportunity to explore - from a writer’s perspective - classic works from the likes of Chekov, Hemingway, Alice Munro, Toni Morrison, Miranda July, Zadie Smith, Courtia Newland and Eley Williams. Taught sessions will be complemented by a dedicated Slack workspace, owned by you and your fellow writers and moderated by the Guardian Masterclasses team. Here you will experience constructive discussions and exchange work with your peers. Stretching your capacity for giving and receiving productive feedback will not only equip you with a deeper understanding of the art of short fiction, but also means you will leave the course with a unique and supportive writing community to guide you in your next steps. For an additional fee of £125, there is the option to have a 30 minute one-to-one mentoring session with Shelley at the end of the course. These are limited to 10 places so early booking is advised. Aspiring, beginner and intermediate writers looking to hone their craft Established writers with a desire to revisit the short story and sharpen their skills You will be sent a link to the webinar 2hrs before the start time of 2pm (BST). Shelley Weiner is the author of five novels, and a renowned creative writing tutor/mentor with a passion for nurturing and guiding writers at all levels. Her short stories have appeared in numerous anthologies in print and online, and have been produced for BBC Radio 4. Shelley has taught and run masterclasses for, among others, the Guardian, Faber Academy, The Literary Consultancy, Gold Dust Mentoring Scheme, The Art of Writing (Florence), and Skyros Writers’ Lab.

1/27/2022,"Indian tech company Ola has announced plans to invest £100m in the UK to open a research and development facility for a planned electric car, in a significant boost to the UK automotive industry. Ola launched its taxi app that rivals Uber in cities including London, Birmingham and Cardiff in 2018, but it is pushing into electric vehicles with a recently launched road-going scooter and a planned electric car.  The new facility will be based in Coventry, the traditional West Midlands centre of the UK automotive industry. It will create 200 jobs in design and engineering. Workers at the plant will also research battery technology. Ola was founded in India in 2010 by Bhavish Aggarwal, and it now claims to be the world’s third-largest ride-hailing app. This week its electric vehicle arm, Ola Electric, raised $200m in funding at a reported $5bn (£3.7bn) valuation, and previous backers include Softbank, the major Japanese technology investor. It is also reportedly planning a stock market float to raise as much as $2bn. The scooters are currently designed and manufactured in Bangalore, but Ola said the new UK facility, dubbed its “Futurefoundry”, will work closely with the headquarters. The company did not detail where it would build its electric cars, although wage costs are significantly lower in India than in the UK. The investment will likely be seen as a vote of confidence in the UK automotive industry, which has seen a recent jump in investment following years of underperformance as big firms awaited clarity on the crucial trading arrangement with the EU. Traditional carmakers such as Volkswagen are racing against newer companies led by America’s Tesla to invest in facilities to build new battery electric vehicles. However, EVs still only accounted for about 12% of UK sales in 2021. The alliance between Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi announced on Thursday became the latest traditional carmaker to outline plans for major investments. The alliance said it would spend €23bn (£19.2bn) over the next five years to launch new electric models, including a new Nissan compact car in Europe – built at a Renault factory in northern France – to replace the Micra. Ola would be a relatively late entrant to the electric car market, but its scooters have initially targeted its home market which is dominated by cheaper models. Ola’s Aggarwal said: “Ola Futurefoundry will enable us to tap into the fantastic automotive design and engineering talent in the UK to create the next generation of electric vehicles. Futurefoundry will work in close collaboration with our headquarters in Bangalore, India to help us build the future of mobility as we make electric vehicles affordable across the world.” The company last year recruited Wayne Burgess, a former Jaguar and Geely designer, to lead the UK vehicle design efforts. Burgess said Ola wanted to create a “world-class design and R&D team with global sensibilities”. He added that the company will look at “two-wheeler, four-wheeler and other form factors.”",News/Business,Indian ride-hailing app Ola to open £100m electric car facility in Coventry,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/27/indian-ride-hailing-app-ola-to-open-100m-electric-car-facility-in-coventry
1/27/2022,"If you’ve managed to live your life so that you’ve somehow avoided the “West Elm Caleb” saga that’s unfolded over the last week, then you’re probably a happier, less perplexed person because of it. And if you’re a single straight woman who uses dating apps and have never dated a young man who resembles West Elm Caleb, then that is nothing less than a miracle. In brief: West Elm Caleb is a guy, 25, who got outed on TikTok for allegedly dating multiple women he met on dating apps, all at the same time, leading them on and then ghosting them. “Back in my day we just called that a fuckboy,” said my friend Amelia, 29. Yes, I know. Back in 2015, I wrote a story for Vanity Fair entitled Tinder and the Dawn of the Dating Apocalypse in which I reported: “A ‘fuckboy’ is a young man who sleeps with women without any intention of having a relationship with them or perhaps even walking them to the door post-sex.”  That story caused an infamously crazy reaction on the part of Tinder, which tweeted at me more than 30 times in one night, so offended were they that I had talked to actual users about their dissatisfaction with the newly launched, now multibillion-dollar app. Tinder was mad because, among other things, I dared to suggest that dating apps (including Bumble and Hinge, where West Elm Caleb met his matches) were exacerbating bad behavior on the part of straight men. Which is what is missing in the many think pieces that have come out about West Elm Caleb: the problem is the design of the technology itself. No, dating apps didn’t invent misogyny or womanizers. But they did give straight men – unvetted men – unfettered access to women. They gave them a new sense of boldness through a seemingly endless set of options. They gave them the ability to decide with the flick of a finger whether a woman was “hot or not” enough for them to date or have sex with. They gave them the ability to create false identities who can’t be held accountable. The effect of all this on straight male psychology is something I’ve discussed with psychologists, feminists, evolutionary biologists and other experts throughout the making of a documentary film and the reporting of several more articles and a book. But you don’t have to have a PhD to see that dating apps privilege the male gaze and give straight men an outsized idea of their power in their dealings with women. In the opinion of another young woman friend: “They have ruined men.” No, I don’t think West Elm Caleb deserved to be doxed or harassed by the people who sought to take revenge on his behavior – no one deserves that. It is wrong. But I’m not surprised that some women rose up against this character, using him as a scapegoat for what they have been enduring in the realm of dating now for years; I’m just surprised it took this long. “West Elm Caleb is a pandemic,” said Molly, 34. “He’s everywhere. Except there’s no vaccine.” Without any change in the toxic dating culture being created by these apps – or the men they’re turning into fuckboys – women have been turning to each other for solidarity online. “What I’m seeing more and more on TikTok is women finding out they’re being cheated on or dating the same guy,” said Lana, 28, “and then pushing back. I have seen girls post, like, ‘If your husband is named Joe with blond hair and tattoos and was just on a business trip in Vegas, he’s cheating on you.’ I also saw a girl who found out her boyfriend of like six months was dating two other girls, and they all ambushed him at the same place. They all looked the same too, ugh.” “Honestly, women should boycott these apps,” said Breanna, 30. “I don’t know what benefit they bring – other than make us more accessible to trash men with bad intentions. I’m telling everyone I know to delete the apps. They’re not worth it and no one I know has met anyone worth a damn on them anyway.” Nancy Jo Sales is a New York-based writer.

1/27/2022,"Families have reacted with elation to the government’s announcement that English care homes will allow unlimited visitors for residents from next week. “It’s absolutely fantastic news,” said Penny Hutchinson, whose mother, Yvonne Williamson, 81, lives in Summerfield House care home in Halifax. “Everyone is delighted. It means we are being listened to.”  The rule change, placing no limits on the number of visitors, means Williamson will be able to see her grandchildren, Lucy, 23, and Kristian, 18, for the first time in two years. While there was a limit of three named visitors, those roles went to her three children. However, the reunion will have to be delayed because, in common with hundreds of other care homes, Summerfield House is tackling an outbreak of Omicron, which means visitors are limited to a single pre-nominated essential caregiver. Care homes will still have to follow outbreak management rules after next week’s rule changes, albeit for 14 rather than 28 days, as has been the case. “We are still pushing for a law so we can’t lock care home residents away without at least one visitor,” Williamson said. Campaign groups such as Rights for Residents have been calling for the government to enshrine the status of “essential caregiver” in law so care homes can never again go into full lockdown. They argue that what would be known as “Gloria’s law” – named after the mother of the care visits campaigner and actor Ruthie Henshall – is a basic human right and say isolation has caused misery as care homes locked their doors to prevent infection spread. It has left families only able to talk to loved ones through plastic screens or bedroom windows. Birgit Clark, whose daughter Franziska, 26, has severe learning difficulties and lives in a care home in Cheshire, said there would be “fireworks going off” if she was allowed back into her daughter’s home. She has not been inside the home for close to two years, although she has seen her daughter outdoors and taken her on trips. But while the guidelines say there is no limit to the number of visitors from Monday, the reality is the home must consult with the local authority health protection team, she says. “They want to open up,” said Clark. “They understand how important it is to have family life. The mental health of the residents has suffered badly. It is loneliness. So I am hoping we are going to get there.” A key problem has been rolling isolation periods for the home, which keep restarting when another Covid case emerges. Care operators are urging families to be patient, indicating that open visits will not be possible in all cases. “It is being introduced from Monday which gives care settings precious little time to prepare,” said Mike Padgham, the chair of the Independent Care Group, which represents some care home operators. “Care and nursing homes are going through their worst ever staffing crisis and, in some cases, might struggle to accommodate a sudden big influx of visitors. It will be down to individual homes to decide but I urge people to be patient with homes and I expect many, like mine for example, will want to retain an appointment system and of course continue to follow the guidance on negative tests, social distancing, personal protective equipment and hygiene.”",News/Society,‘Absolutely fantastic’: families’ joy at opening up of English care homes,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/27/absolutely-fantastic-families-joy-at-opening-up-of-english-care-homes

1/27/2022,"I recommend a Northamptonshire countryside route that combines winding lanes bordered by fields, chocolate-box villages, manor houses and the execution spot of Mary Queen of Scots, Fotheringhay Castle. I like to make a circular route starting in Fotheringhay up to Nassington, on to Yarwell and Kingscliff, then head back via Apethorpe Palace and Woodnewton. This route is about 22km, but you can lengthen and shorten the route depending on your energy level by adding in or taking out villages. I like to rely on the signposts to navigate, rather than my phone. Make sure to look out for hares, red kites and fallow deer along the route, and post-ride there are some lovely local pubs with open fires.Imogen Chappelow  There is a route through Epping Forest from Epping to Loughton that is wide, well-marked and has enough flat and hilly terrain to keep all skill levels happy. Aside from that, it is well served for refreshments by the Forest Gate Inn at one end and the Victoria Tavern at the other. The flora and fauna is always stunning, but in winter the quieter runs and stark beauty means any encounter with wildlife is accentuated.Keiran As a cyclist in London, I spend most of my summer weekends escaping to the delights of the North Downs or the Surrey Hills. However, in winter, the higher roads can stay icy, even when those in town are clear. So to avoid the winter road roulette, I take to the Thames cycle path. This runs from source to sea, but for a lunchtime or post-work training ride I tend to take in the sections between Tower Bridge and Woolwich. They are flat and well paved and tend to stay ice-free, with plenty of warm drink and snack options to keep those winter miles fuelled! You also get to admire a world heritage site in Greenwich as well as some spectacular engineering as you roll past the Thames flood barrier.Dan  Guardian Travel readers' tips Every week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels. A selection of tips will be featured online and may appear in print. To enter the latest competition visit the readers' tips homepage - My local “round the block” ride takes in the glorious Dyffryn Ogwen (Ogwen valley), Dyffryn Mymbyr (Mymbyr valley) and Pen-Y-Pass, towards Llanberis village. Setting out in winter is like heading into Mordor, with snow-capped peaks, moody purple-grey clouds, and the sight of Tryfan ridge, like a dragon’s back. As it opens out, you can enjoy the lovely, steady descent to Capel Curig village, hanging a right, you pass the Mymbyr lakes with the Snowdon Horseshoe ahead, before coming up and over the side of Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon), and the exhilarating soar down the other side. With drama and mountains at every turn, this ride never gets any less breathtaking.Marieke Hofsteede The best cycling of my life was done a few years ago ago when I retired, packing my bags and a bike to cycle around Italy, top-to-toe. The most energising, invigorating route was a winter whirl around Lake Maggiore. The microclimate and sparkling January sunshine – glimmering on the lake on one side and bouncing off snow-topped Alpine peaks on the other – were an inspiration to keep pedalling. Start at Arona on the Piedmont side, then head up to Stresa, with its lovely belle époque hotels – feel free to stop for a warming cappuccino or grappa, as I did! You can then bike round the lake, passing though Locarno in Switzerland, or put your bike on a ferry to the Lombard side.Bill Blow the cobwebs away on a sunny winter’s day. Starting from the V&A Dundee (schedule a visit before or after your ride), watch the winter sunrise over the Tay Estuary before taking the coastal path north on Sustrans Route 1. The 35 miles to Montrose include a mix of dedicated cycle paths and quiet country lanes with gorgeous sea views keeping you company the whole way. Have a picnic lunch sheltered in the dunes on the expansive sandy beach of Lunan Bay before finishing at the Montrose Basin reserve, where in October, around 80,000 pink-footed geese arrive for winter. Admire the sea views once again on the return journey by train from Montrose to Dundee.Naomi Clarke Istanbul is a scenic location for a winter bike ride and you can now travel 80 miles of designated cycle paths there. The city itself has an expansive cycling route on its Asian side. Starting in Kadıköy, with views over to Europe, there is a nearly uninterrupted landscaped path along the coast of the Bosphorus and Marmara Sea that takes cyclists through Caddebostan, Bostancı, and up to Pendik. In winter the smog lifts to become sparkling sunshine and you can stop for a warming tea and sesame-seed bread along the route. I rented a bike from Isbike and put it on a ferry to the car-free Princes Islands, for calm, easy cycling with views over two continents.Nick Less than a third of the Bay Cycle Way’s 81-mile route is traffic-free, but the 16-mile section between Carnforth and Glasson Dock is mostly off-road. It follows a canal towpath, Morecambe promenade and disused railway tracks, and offers the best views across Morecambe Bay. There are plenty of convenient places to park, including at Glasson Dock, Conder Green and in Morecambe. There is also an abundance of refreshment stops, though not all the cafes are open during winter (you’ll always find something in Lancaster and Morecambe). As Morecambe promenade has been very busy during the last two summers due to an influx of visitors, the ride will be much more pleasant in winter.Graham Dean The power station at Ratcliffe-on-Soar may seem an unlikely focus for a beautiful winter cycling route but the network of nearby lanes make for stunning views. I start in the Derbyshire town of Long Eaton, heading south across the River Trent into Leicestershire, where a look over the shoulder early in the morning will see the sun rising over the cooling towers. From there the choices are limitless, but why not make a three-counties of it? Head east and you’re soon across the Soar and into Nottinghamshire, where snaking lanes and wooded hillsides await. The return westwards takes in some picturesque villages with tempting cafe stops, before the turrets of Ratcliffe beckon the weary cyclist home.Michael Not your usual bike trip. Me, an OAP with my secondhand e-bike, on an epic ride: four weeks travelling westward ahead of the encroaching winter, through awe-inspiring landscapes, from the sun-baked, Mediterranean-fringed mountains of the Cabo de Gata, high over the snow-capped Sierra Nevada, and down through the Serranía de Ronda’s vast cork forests to the Atlantic coast. Initially you’ll find cactus and thyme-edged tracks, then Alpujarran ways with windfall treats of almonds, avocados, and persimmons, and finally vultures circling over thick rainforest. Blue skies, great food, and red wine – soul enriching.John Martin",Lifestyle/Travel,Drama and stark beauty at every turn: readers’ favourite winter cycles in the UK and Europe,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/jan/27/drama-and-stark-beauty-at-every-turn-readers-favourite-winter-cycles-in-the-uk-and-europe
1/27/2022,"Good morning. With the news yesterday that Justice Stephen Breyer will retire from the supreme court, Joe Biden now has the opportunity to not only fulfil a campaign promise, but to solidify his legacy.  CNN is reporting that Biden and Breyer are set to make a public appearance today to formally announce Breyer’s retirement. At 83, Breyer is the oldest member of the highest court in the country, one of the three liberals outnumbered by six conservatives. Biden had promised to make sure there would be a Black woman on the supreme court if he was elected president. Court watchers have already thrown out a number of possibilities of who Biden could nominate to take Breyer’s place, including several US court of appeals judges and US district court judges, an associate supreme court justice of California and Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the Legal Defense and Educational Fund at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People As tensions continue to rise at the Ukraine border, the US has strengthen its stance on the strategically vital gas supply between Russia and Germany, the Nord Stream 2, saying it won’t open if Russia invades Ukraine. Emily Haber, Germany’s ambassador to Washington, appeared to endorse a hardening of the position, saying on Twitter that “the US and Germany jointly declared last summer: if Russia uses energy as a weapon or if there is another violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty, Russia will have to pay a high price”. The graphic novel, Maus: A Survivor’s Tale, uses hand-drawn illustrations of mice and cats to depict how the author’s parents survived Auschwitz during the Holocaust. Ten school board members in McMinn county, Tennessee have cited the eight curse words and an illustration of a naked cartoon mouse in the novel as reason enough to ban it. Art Spiegelman, the author, said he was baffled by the decision. “I’ve met so many young people who … have learned things from my book,” Spiegelman said. “I also understand that Tennessee is obviously demented. There’s something going on very, very haywire there.” In an open letter to his manager and record label, Neil Young accused music streaming platform Spotify of allowing the propagation of vaccine misinformation by Joe Rogan’s podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience. In 2020, Rogan signed a $100m deal that gave the streaming giant exclusive rights to his show. “I want you to let Spotify know immediately TODAY that I want all my music off their platform,” Young wrote. “They can have Rogan or Young. Not both.” The first female president of Honduras, Xiomara Castro, is set to be sworn in today, making history as she faces daunting challenges before her.

Preliminary data from the San Francisco police department showed that reports of hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders increased dramatically, from 2020 t0 2021, as across the US, reports of hate incidents against Asian Americans have jumped during the pandemic.

1/27/2022,"The death of a five-year-old boy whose family had had previous contact with authorities is to be reviewed by child safeguarding experts. Dylan Scanlon, a “happy, funny and cheeky little boy”, was pronounced dead by emergency services who responded to an incident at his home in Oldham on New Year’s Eve.  Greater Manchester police (GMP) said its investigation into how Dylan died was still ongoing. Dylan’s death will now be the focus of a child safeguarding review, expected to be launched in the coming days, following previous contact between his family and the authorities. GMP said it had referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct because its officers had been in contact with the family before the incident. Officers were called by the ambulance service to the property in the Limeside area of Oldham, at 6.20pm on 31 December. Dylan was pronounced dead at the scene and a woman in her 30s was detained under the Mental Health Act. A spokesperson for Oldham council said: “A review of Dylan’s case is currently under way. We expect this to progress to a full child safeguarding practice review, the findings of which will be published in due course. “That child safeguarding practice review will be carried out by an independent author, with the full cooperation of Oldham council and other partners. “It will examine the circumstances around Dylan’s death and look into how organisations, including the council, were involved with Dylan during his life.” In a statement released by GMP, Dylan’s father said: “Dylan was my best mate.“He was a happy, funny and cheeky little boy, who was full of excitement – especially about doing new things.“Dylan loved going to school, playing with his friends and dogs and going for drives with me to parks and lakes. He loved being at the lake but not walking around it – he was there for the ice-cream, a ride on Daddy’s shoulders and a McDonald’s on the way home. “His favourite times of year were Christmas and his birthday – he knew he’d be spoiled.” He added: “I’ve been looking through memories on my phone – videos of him crawling and learning how to walk. I will always remember his face when I got home from work – he was always happy to see me and I loved spending any time with him that I could.“Dylan will be sadly missed by all family and friends, especially his brother, who he loved and absolutely adored.

1/27/2022,"Today (Thursday 27 January) marks the 2,500th instalment of the Guardian’s Politics Live blog with Andrew Sparrow, with over a decade bringing Guardian readers all over the world the day’s political stories live from Westminster. Beginning as a daily general election blog in March 2010 before launching as Politics Live with Andrew Sparrow in May 2010, the first edition covered the Tory-Lib Dem coalition and news of George Osborne’s plans to cut public spending.  The hugely popular blog has amassed over 1 billion page views in its lifetime, and now regularly attracts more than 10,000 comments a day. The blog has published over 17 million words since 2016 alone – the equivalent of around 250 novels or 30 copies of War and Peace. Most of that has come from Andrew although, now the blog is such a permanent feature on the website, other Guardian journalists contribute too. Andrew Sparrow, political correspondent, Guardian News & Media says: “In late 2009, the Guardian website led with my Iraq inquiry blog for days, as opposed to a conventional news story. This was a breakthrough moment and showed a huge appetite from readers wanting instant news and reaction in a growing digital world. I then ran a daily general election blog in 2010 and after the election was over it just kept going as Politics Live.

1/27/2022,"A cabinet minister has argued that the national insurance rise should go ahead as planned despite Tory rebels reportedly pushing for it to be scrapped as the price for their support of Boris Johnson’s leadership. Thérèse Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, said there were no “dissenting voices” in government pushing for the increase to be ditched, or pushed back, ahead of its introduction on 6 April.  With Johnson under intense pressure over two investigations into alleged rule-breaking parties in Downing Street and Whitehall, the prime minister has reportedly been urged to U-turn on the tax rise by MPs he is meeting for one-to-one chats in his Commons office. Critical MPs have felt emboldened to make demands of Johnson given his tenuous position, while he waits for the findings of a civil service inquiry led by Sue Gray – expected within days – and a separate Metropolitan police inquiry. Despite some backbench Tories clamouring for the national insurance rise not to go ahead, only five of the party’s MPs voted against it in September. Coffey said she “genuinely” did not know when the long-awaited Gray report would be released, but suggested there was not expected to be any change to the introduction of the levy, which is being used to clear the NHS backlog due to Covid before it will be spent on social care. “It should go ahead. That’s what’s been decided,” she told Times Radio. She added: “Parliament voted for the levy, it’s designed to support the NHS and future NHS support as well. It’s set to be happening in April, I see no reason why that will change.” After some cabinet ministers were said to be nervous about the tax hike’s introduction at a time of sharply rising inflation and when the energy price cap is increased, Coffey denied there was any government split. “I’m not aware of any dissenting voices,” she said. Johnson’s position could become even more precarious after new evidence appeared to contradict his claim it was “complete nonsense” he had anything to do with approving the evacuation of animals from Afghanistan looked after by the charity Nowzad. Fresh emails from the Foreign Office showed officials confirmed on 25 August 2021 “the PM has just authorised their staff and animals to be evacuated” – despite thousands of people being left behind during the frantic military withdrawal from Kabul. Coffey dismissed the revelation, saying Johnson “didn’t make any individual decisions about evacuations”. She added: “A lot of people will claim that the PM is involved in supporting their particular pet projects but the PM said he wasn’t involved in individual decisions, that is what the defence secretary, who was in charge of Operation Pitting overall, has said as well.” New rules for unemployed workers receiving state benefits are due to come into force – cutting the time they can spend looking purely for work similar to their previous job from three months to four weeks. Coffey told LBC: “We know there are plenty of jobs and we have plenty of people who receive benefits every week while they are looking for work, and we’re intensifying our approach.” She added: “There are over a million jobs to be filled and we’re going to help people get into those.” Despite the mounting pressure on Johnson and Labour accusing him of having been caught lying again, it emerged overnight that he could have been given a significant political reprieve. The Times reported that the executive of the 1922 Committee, which would oversee a vote of no confidence, decided against cutting the length of time a leader is immune to facing another ballot from 12 months to six. It means if 54 Tory MPs submit a letter declaring no confidence in Johnson, a vote of the whole party will be held – but another cannot be called for at least a year.",News/Politics,"National insurance rise will go ahead despite Tory dissent, insists minister",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/27/national-insurance-rise-will-go-ahead-despite-tory-dissent-insists-minister
1/27/2022,"Xiomara Castro will be sworn in as the first female president of Honduras on Thursday, marking the culmination of a remarkable rise to power that began just over 12 years ago when she led a massive protest movement in response to the ousting of her husband, former president Manuel “Mel” Zelaya, in a military-backed coup. Castro’s resounding victory in the 28 November election has generated hope for a new era for women in the country with the highest rate of femicide in Latin America and some of the region’s most draconian laws with regards to reproductive rights.  “In her plan for government she took us into account,” said Regina Fonseca, director of the Centre for the Rights of Women in Honduras. “That gives us enormous hope to return to life.” Activists are optimistic that Castro, of the center-left Libre party, will not only take actions that help improve conditions for women in the immediate, but also accelerate broader changes in the country’s culture. “This small break in the patriarchy that her win represents can become bigger and bigger, in the sense that it can open even more spaces for participation in government and political participation in general for women in the country,” said Carmen Haydée, a human rights lawyer and representative of the feminist group Luchemos. Among the first order of business, Castro is expected to undo a prohibition against emergency contraceptives enacted in the wake of the coup. Honduras is the only country in Latin America with absolute bans on both abortion and emergency contraceptives. As a result, women who have been raped have been forced to seek out emergency contraceptives on the black market. Since emergency contraceptives were outlawed by decree, Castro will be able to act unilaterally to undo the ban. When it comes to abortion, however, the situation is much more complex. In her plan for government Castro included a proposal to legalize abortion in the case of rape, when the mother’s life is at risk and when the fetus is not viable. But last year, conservative legislators approved a constitutional reform that raised the threshold needed to modify the country’s total abortion ban to 75% of congress. When a measure similar to Castro’s proposal was placed before congress in 2017, only eight of the 128 legislators voted in favor. Although Castro’s party has made gains in congress since then, the legislature remains controlled by conservatives – including many from her own party. “It seems to me that our fight will continue to be within the judiciary to achieve that change,” said Fonseca. “With this congress as it is, it will not be possible.” Castro’s proposal – the first such proposal from a president in Honduras – is nonetheless significant. “I do believe that Xiomara’s openness to that possibility does allow us to generate spaces for dialogue, reflection, awareness and discussion,” said Fonseca. On the issue of femicide, there is much more political will to act, but the challenge is no less daunting. “We know that it will not be resolved in four years, but we are also certain that much can be sown and fertilized so that a future free of violence for girls and women flourishes,” said Fonseca. Women’s rights groups have been working with members of Castro’s transition team to draft a violence against women law that will address deficiencies in the justice system that have led to disturbingly high levels of impunity. Castro has also proposed the establishment of shelters for women who are survivors of domestic violence, more inclusive economic development and the implementation of an integral sexual education program in schools. “It’s a question of reinforcing in schools the values of respect, values of equality, values of positive identities for girls, that it is understood that women are also human, nothing more and nothing less,” said Fonseca. In that regard, Castro’s mere existence as president of the nation could have a positive effect. As the presidential sash is placed across her shoulders, countless girls and young women will be watching from across the country. “I think that inevitably what girls are going to be thinking is that I can also be her, eventually I can also aspire to that, and that opens up a whole world of possibilities regarding your place in society,” said Haydée.",News/Global development,Honduras: can first female president usher in a new era for women?,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/26/honduras-first-female-president-xiomara-castro-women
1/27/2022,"A 1,600-hectare (4,000-acre) gated community, dubbed El Paraíso Verde, or The Green Paradise, is being carved out of the fertile red earth of Caazapá, one of Paraguay’s poorest regions. The community’s population – consisting mainly of German, Austrian and Swiss immigrants – will eventually swell from 150 to 3,000, according to the owners.  The project’s website bills it as “by far the largest urbanization and settlement project in South America”, describing the colony as a refuge from “socialist trends of current economic and political situations worldwide” – as well as “5G, chemtrails, fluoridated water, mandatory vaccinations and healthcare mandates”. Immigration to the colony has stepped up since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, with residents interviewed on its YouTube channel attributing their move to scepticism about the virus and vaccines. Caazapá, a rural region dominated by cattle ranching in the heart of lush eastern Paraguay, saw a jump from four new German residents in 2019 to 101 in 2021, according to official figures. “Anti-vaxxer” immigrants have also been reported settling in other parts of Paraguay. One German citizen who lives nearby and who does business with Paraíso Verde, cited discredited conspiracy theories about coronavirus vaccines to explain the surge. They claimed that Paraguay’s accommodating immigration laws have proved attractive to Germans who want to “escape the matrix” and flee the “deep state and one world order”. “Many older people are coming. They understand that many people are dying in care homes [after vaccination],” said the German, who asked not to be named. “And the others, in their 40s, are trying to bring their children over here to escape.” But the appearance of an insular colony of Europeans has been watched with concern by some in the nearby the regional capital, also named Caazapá. “Why are they here? We don’t know, but we want to find out,” said Rodney Mereles, a former municipal councillor. On its YouTube channel, Paraíso Verde shares videos describing the pandemic which has killed some 5.5 million people as “non-existent”, promoting false, dangerous Covid “miracle cures”, and advertising Paraguay as a country without pandemic restrictions – despite the government’s clear health protocols. Even as Paraguay recorded the world’s highest Covid death rate per capita in June 2021, the colony shared videos of large parties in violation of restrictions. In Germany, sections of society radicalised by the refugee crisis of 2015 have proved a fertile ground for disinformation and conspiracy theories about the pandemic. The far-right Alternative für Deutschland party has tried to revive its waning electoral fortunes by railing against lockdown measures, mask mandates and vaccines. And a small minority of those sceptics have decided to head abroad, with Bulgaria reported as another popular destination. The presence in Caazapá of a large group of Covid skeptics worries local health authorities. Dr Nadia Riveros, Caazapá’s head of public health, said the pandemic had been devastating for the region, which has no ICU beds and only one fully equipped ambulance. “We don’t want to go through that again. I think foreigners, wherever they’re from, should have to get vaccinated before entering the country,” she said. And as Paraguay faces a quickly escalating third wave of Covid while struggling to improve on the second-lowest vaccination rate in South America, the health ministry announced this month that non-resident foreigners entering the country must now present vaccination certificates. At least six German nationals without vaccination certificates have been refused entry since this new regulation came into force. Paraguay has a long and sometimes troubled history of inward-looking immigrant colonies driven by ideological and religious zeal. Settlement projects by Mennonites, Australian socialists and the Unification church among others have all left marks on the country. Paraguay’s most notorious settlement was Nueva Germania, the proto-fascist colony set up in 1886 by Elizabeth Nietzsche – the philosopher’s sister – and her husband Bernhard Förster. Förster died, probably by suicide, as Nueva Germania sank under the weight of financial problems, internal conflict and settlers’ lack of agricultural knowledge. While Nietzsche and Förster envisioned an Aryan colony untouched by Jewish influence, El Paraíso Verde’s founder and leader Erwin Annau has spoken of preserving Germanic peoples from the presence of Islam and – on a website that was recently taken offline – questioned the blame allocated to Germany for the second world war. In a 2017 speech given before members of the Paraguayan government, Annau said: “Islam is not part of Germany. We are enlightened Christians, and we are concerned about our daughters. We see the Qur’an as [containing] an ideology of political domination, which is not compatible with democratic and Christian values.” Paraguay itself has a small but well-established Muslim community in several major cities. Abdun Nur Baten, missionary for the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community of Paraguay, highlighted the apparent contradiction in Annau’s comments. “They say Muslim immigrants don’t integrate, that they don’t adopt German culture or German norms, that they’re not assimilating. So, it’s very hypocritical to go to another land and do exactly what you are accusing Muslims of doing: it’s beyond funny how hypocritical it is,” Nur Baten said. He said his community would welcome peaceful dialogue with Paraíso Verde. But despite concerns in the local community, Paraíso Verde is backed by increasing political and economic power. The group has frequently met with local and national officials, and claims to have held meetings with Paraguayan health authorities to lobby against tighter Covid regulations. Gladys Rojas, a former president of Caazapá town council, claimed that Paraíso Verde was protected by links to the political faction of the former Paraguayan president Horacio Cartes. Cartes is a controversial businessman who has repeatedly contested allegations he is linked to cigarette smuggling, but is considered Paraguay’s richest and most powerful person. Two members of the Cartes family have been board members of Reljuv, a company owned by Paraíso Verde, and in recent municipal elections, the company’s president, Juan Buker, was heavily involved in election campaigns for candidates backed by Cartes. “They’ve got politicians and money on their side,” said Rojas, adding that many in Caazapá, the region with the highest rate of extreme poverty in Paraguay, were reluctant to ask questions as the colony has become the area’s biggest employer. Rojas currently faces trespass charges over protests to protect Isla Susu, a nature reserve that experienced heavy environmental damage during construction works at Paraíso Verde. The settlement later paid a fine for the damage. On a recent afternoon, the Guardian travelled along the dirt road from the town of Caazapá to Paraíso Verde. Close to the long perimeter fence, groups of residents strolled along the track in the slowly softening sun. At the entrance gate, a Reljuv employee emerged, flanked by guards armed with long guns. After rejecting the possibility of entry or an interview, the employee aggressively demanded to examine identity documents of all present, even as the reporter attempted to leave. “You know what to do,” the employee repeated, confusingly. Paraíso Verde did not respond to repeated requests for comment.",News/World news,German-speaking Covid denialists seek to build paradise in Paraguay,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/27/paraguay-german-speaking-covid-denialists-settlement-new-paradise
