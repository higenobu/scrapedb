3/15/2022,"Hidden among this year’s thicket of anniversaries is the centenary of Charles Mingus’s birth – 2022 also marks 50 years since the first performance of his String Quartet No 1, commissioned by Whitney Museum of American Art as part of a programme celebrating the poet Frank O’Hara. The piece, for voice and string quartet (violin, viola and two cellos), only received its European premiere three years ago. It’s more Bartók than blues, a compressed scrawl of diligent counterpoint that remains persistently entangled for about 10 minutes. Opening Music in the Round’s Sounds of Now series, new music group Apartment House and Elaine Mitchener gave a relatively straightforward account of this expressive and occasionally passionate work. I’d be intrigued to hear a more languid interpretation – perhaps on a long overdue premiere recording.This was the only small disappointment in a stirring hour of music mostly drawn from the American experimental music tradition. In a post-concert talk, Mitchener underlined the centrality of struggle to the programme’s featured poets – from Susan Griffin’s declamations in Christian Wolff’s I Like to Think of Harriet Tubman, to Jeanne Lee’s provocations in the striking Blasé by saxophonist Archie Shepp. Lee’s Mingus Meditations – a duet for voice and double bass, originally recorded with Dave Holland – was a real treat, with nimble bass work from the impressive Neil Charles supporting Mitchener’s characterful chattering. Sandwiched between those pieces were two responses to visual works, treated as graphic scores (Louise Bourgeois’ musically suggestive Insomnia Drawings and the experimental typography of Jackson Mac Low’s The text on the opposite page), plus an expanded version of Ben Patterson’s Duo for Voice and String Instrument, and some of Mitchener’s own work. Mitchener’s phonetic fireworks and command of register are instantly striking, but her dedication to the huge variety of spoken text carried the evening’s most profound moments. Sounds of Now continues until 19 May.",Arts/Music,Apartment House/Elaine Mitchener review – poetry and provocations ,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/14/apartment-house-elaine-mitchener-review-channing-hall-sheffield
3/15/2022,"Boris Johnson is expected to visit Saudi Arabia to push for an increase in oil output despite an outcry over the regime’s biggest ever mass execution and growing fears the prime minister may try to limit media scrutiny of the trip. Downing Street would not confirm Johnson’s likely trip to Riyadh, but sources have said he wants to appeal to the Gulf state to increase its oil output to replace supplies from Russia. Ahead of the planned trip, MPs are planning to raise concerns about Saudi Arabia’s execution of 81 men on Saturday. Crispin Blunt, a backbench Conservative MP, has secured an urgent question in the House of Commons. Johnson’s official spokesperson said on Monday that the prime minister was concerned about all human rights abuses and opposed the death penalty. “The UK is firmly opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances, in every country, as a matter of principle, and we routinely raise human rights issues with other countries including Saudi Arabia and will be raising Saturday’s executions with the government in Riyadh,” he said. There are also human rights concerns over Saudi Arabia’s role in the war in Yemen, after years of leading a coalition against Iran-backed rebels. More than a dozen UN agencies and international aid groups said on Monday that 161,000 people in the war-torn country were likely to experience famine over the second half of the year – a fivefold increase. Despite No 10 insisting that the prime minister would take the opportunity to raise the issue of human rights, it appears Johnson is unlikely to allow open access to the media on any planned trip. Prime ministers have traditionally always allowed UK journalists to accompany them when they travel abroad to meet foreign leaders on overnight stays. However, it is expected that any trip by Johnson will be limited to one broadcaster and one journalist from the newswires, known as the “pool” – which has been the arrangement for numerous trips that he has taken to European capitals in recent weeks. Theresa May and Gordon Brown both took journalists during very short visits to Saudi Arabia, raising the prospect that No 10 may be trying to set a new precedent in terms of transparency and media scrutiny. Johnson has long had a personal relationship with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. In 2018, as foreign secretary, he wrote that Prince Mohammed was a reformer who “deserves our support”, adding: “I believe that the crown prince, who is only 32, has demonstrated by word and deed that he aims to guide Saudi Arabia in a more open direction.” That was just six months before the murder of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which US intelligence agencies have since concluded was approved by Prince Mohammed. Last year the crown prince was revealed to have texted Johnson personally to ask him to intervene to “correct” the Premier League’s “wrong” decision not to allow a £300m takeover of Newcastle United by a Saudi-led consortium. Johnson asked Edward Lister, the then special envoy for the Gulf, to take up the issue, and Lord Lister reportedly told the prime minister: “I’m on the case. I will investigate.” The government did not have the power to prevent a Premier League decision but the deal eventually went through after undertakings that the Saudi government would not control the club. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, insisted on Monday that Saudi Arabia was an “important” economic partner. He told LBC: “We’ve had a longstanding relationship with the Saudi government where there’s always a very frank exchange. We don’t agree with their approach on human rights; we’re always right to call that out and to talk to them frankly about that. “At the same time, it is also possible to have an economic relationship. You know, whether people like it or not, Saudi Arabia is the world’s largest producer of crude oil and it’s important, especially at the time of a major global energy crisis, that we have these talks with them.” Johnson has been focusing on the impending energy crisis in recent days, holding roundtable talks with oil and gas producers on Monday to discuss ways to increase production in the North Sea. The Treasury has repeatedly ruled out a windfall tax on the companies despite them benefiting from higher oil prices, as the government wants to encourage them to invest more in extraction.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson plans Saudi Arabia visit to seek oil supply increase,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/14/boris-johnson-saudi-arabia-visit-oil-supply-output
3/15/2022,"Take Me Out was one of the earliest songs we wrote, when they were coming easily, almost effortlessly. I shared a flat in Glasgow with Nick McCarthy and we had the sort of little keyboard you get for Christmas when you’re 14. Nick played over its automatic accompaniment and came up with what turned out to be the first three chords of the verse of Take Me Out. The night before, I had watched Enemy at the Gates, about two snipers – one Russian, one German – trying to take each other out during the battle of Stalingrad. It struck me as a really good metaphor for a romantic situation: you know the other person feels something, but you’re both afraid to make a move. I wrote the lyrics about the craving to release that tension – “Take me out” being a plea to end it. After I sang some words over Nick’s melody, he came up with the chorus by playing a different chord progression over the keyboard’s bluegrass setting. I was mucking about on the guitar when the main riff just popped out. The “I know I won’t be leaving here with you” section formed a bridge between the verse and chorus, but when we rehearsed it with the band, it didn’t sound right. The tempo of the chorus was much slower than the verse, so I suggested playing all the verses at the beginning, but slower, then the choruses. It sounded great. The short staccato bursts of sound – where you hit a cymbal and hold it to stop it resonating – came about because Bob Hardy, our bass-player, had read an article about “sports rock”, the music played at sports games in the US. We thought it would be funny to spoof the sounds you got on Queen records or the beginning of Eye of the Tiger. The first time we played the whole song in the rehearsal room, I joked: “This would sound really good on the radio.” But I was thinking of a session on John Peel or something – if we were lucky. When you come up with a song like that, the dreamer in you is thinking: “One day, we’ll play this in Mexico City.” But the realist thinks, “We’ll press up 500 copies and sell 35”, which is what had happened with all the other bands I’d been in. When we recorded it, Tore Johansson, the producer, hated it and kept asking: “Why are we recording this? The other songs are so much better.” I don’t remember hating Take Me Out! But I certainly didn’t like the famous guitar riff. It was a good hook but I thought it sounded like a bagpipe melody. Otherwise, Take Me Out was great on the demo and already had the marvellous intro in a different tempo. Before working with them, I saw the band live and told them I liked the Talking Heads vibe some songs had and suggested we explore that. I think that got me the job of producing them, but I didn’t have to change much. I’d been much more creative when I produced the Cardigans. Franz had the concept ready. The main thing I added was an aggressive sound. I wanted to give listeners the loudness of a live gig. We recorded at Gula Studion in my home town, Malmö in Sweden, which had a great 1970s console and a big sounding room. It was nice to be home but it had also been hard to find a similar studio in the UK for the same money. We recorded as live as possible, without a click track to keep us in tempo. Very few musicians can play well to a click track, and natural tempo changes in a song can be great. We used Pro Tools editing to fix mistakes. I cleaned up all the instruments and made them very tight with the drums to give the song that mechanical feel. They were easy to record, as Paul Thomson is a fantastic drummer. I couldn’t understand his thick Scottish accent so the others had to translate. The whole band were leaning on his drumming, especially poor Bob on bass, who was a non-musician friend they had dragged in. He was learning how to play during the recording! I had absolutely no idea the song would become so big. I thought it was going to work on alternative radio in the UK. So I was shocked when it was played on mainstream radio in the US. It must have been the “bagpipes”.

3/15/2022,"This grisly black comedy will do nothing to dispel the old cliche about France being a nation of steak-frites-devouring meat-eaters. It’s the story of husband-and-wife butchers who become serial killers – making vegans into mincemeat, literally. It is a slight, lightweight film, gruesomely hilarious in places, with one or two echoes of the Coen brothers’ Fargo. Giving nicely deadpan performances, Marina Foïs and director Fabrice Eboué play unhappily married butchers Sophie and Vincent, who are looking down the barrel of bankruptcy and divorce when they accidentally kill a vegan activist. Naturally, they dispose of his body using the tools of their trade. But then Sophie unwittingly puts the human meat on the shelves – and it’s an instant hit with customers (“I’ve never tasted anything like it!”). So the pair start bumping off vegans to sell as specialist pork. The only problem is maintaining their supply of human ham. What follows is a series of farcical scenes – that are somewhat repetitive, to be honest – in which the pair pretend to be animal rights activists to lure victims. The trouble is, vegans tend to be on the skinny side – what’s needed are chunkier victims. Vincent says no to a chubby nine-year-old, because he draws the line at butchering kids, so Sophie (she’s the ruthless one) tries to persuade him: “But veal is the best of all!” Some Like It Rare is a tasty treat for herbivores and carnivores alike, and it honestly doesn’t feel like an anti-vegan film (but then, I’m only vegetarian). There are one or two sanctimonious vegan characters, but the nastiest piece of work here is an arrogant, casually racist multimillionaire butcher. If anything, the sight of Vincent and Sophie feeding a human hand into the meat grinder is enough to put you off flesh for life, whatever the variety.  Some Like It Rare is released on 21 March on digital platforms.",Arts/Film,Some Like It Rare review – grisly laughs from butchers on a killing spree,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/14/some-like-it-rare-review-grisly-laughs-from-butchers-on-a-killing-spree
3/15/2022,"Over the last two years, concert-goers have become used to artist substitutions and programme changes. The Philharmonia’s all-Tchaikovsky programme with their principal conductor Santtu-Matias Rouvali had both: it had proved impossible for the pianist Nobuyuki Tsujii to travel to London for the concert and in his place came Bruce Liu, who last autumn won the most prestigious of all piano prizes, the International Chopin competition in Warsaw. It was Liu’s UK debut, and he brought with him a change of concerto too, opting for the challenge of Tchaikovsky’s Second Piano Concerto, which is far less often performed than its popular predecessor. There can’t be many pianists in the early stages of their international careers with that huge, daunting work in their repertoire, but apparently Liu has been playing it for a number of years, and the tireless confidence with which he launched into its cascades of figuration suggested an easy familiarity with it. On first encounter, there seems something attractively straightforward about his approach; an elegance and lightness of touch which came to the fore in the slow movement, with its extended solos for the orchestra’s leader and its principal cello, to which Liu added the most delicate of embellishment. But there is no shortage of muscle when required in his playing either. He gave as good as he got in the first movement’s exchanges with the orchestra and led the charge from the front in the noisy dash of the finale. Rouvali’s approach to Tchaikovsky seems thoughtful too. He’d begun with a wonderfully refined performance of the symphonic poem Francesca da Rimini, based on an episode from The Divine Comedy, managing to avoid the bombast of the opening and closing sections … territory that Tchaikovsky would revisit 17 years later in the first movement of the symphony with which Rouvali ended the concert so impressively, the Pathétique, though in that work the programme is the composer himself rather than Dante.

3/15/2022,"Take a moment to imagine yourself in a room where it’s hard to see the floor because the space is so cluttered. It’s not immediately clear what the purpose of the room is – there’s a desk in one corner, a sofa in the other, and sandwiched in between is an exercise bike. The walls are painted an oppressive shade of brown, and very little light comes in through the windows so the space is illuminated mainly by a bare bulb giving out a blue-ish glow. This doesn’t feel like somewhere you’d want to spend time, and if the very thought of it is making you feel uneasy, uncomfortable or even stressed, you’re far from alone. There’s increasing evidence that the environments we spend time in can have a huge impact on our emotional wellbeing. One company that has spent many years looking at people’s thoughts and feelings about how they live is IKEA. It publishes an annual report based on thousands of responses from people worldwide, and the latest, IKEA’s Life at Home report 2021, confirms the intimate connection between how we feel about our homes and how we feel about ourselves – 40% of people who took part said their mental health improved when they felt positive about their homes. But our homes don’t just affect our wellbeing, they have an impact on our relationships too. An earlier IKEA report, from 2017, found that 40% of people said they lived with things they hated but couldn’t throw away because they belonged to someone else … but about 40% of those surveyed said they had thrown away something that belonged to someone they lived with, without telling them. Over the past two years, our relationship with our homes has been more important than ever. We’ve needed them to feel welcoming and comforting, our sanctuaries if you like. But what does it take to make a home a sanctuary? IKEA’s research identified three important aspects to achieving this: having a place that makes best use of its space; rooms that function well; and that promote a sense of emotional stability. “IKEA champions every home to be a haven, a sanctuary that fulfils our everyday needs – whether that’s a place to work, sleep, relax or socialise – or, these days, all four,” says Marie Tenglund, UK interior design leader. “This is especially pressing because the past couple of years have put huge pressure on our living spaces, demanding that they be – often simultaneously – offices, restaurants, cinema and schools.” With us cramming so much activity into our homes they can start to feel claustrophobic, which is why being able to create a sense of space is important. But one of the enemies of spaciousness is clutter – an interior blight that has been shown to have a negative effect on relationships. A survey carried out in 2018 found that 66.5% of people admitted to arguing over clutter with someone they live with. Fortunately there are solutions at hand to help us find a place for everything. IKEA has developed clever storage that can fit into the smallest spaces, or double as other types of furniture – the Smastad bench comes with space for storing away bits and pieces, while the Hol side table, another two-in-one piece of furniture, also has storage that will help us clear surfaces of clutter. As well as creating space, the right furniture can help a room function well, which all contributes to the sense of our home as our sanctuary. Given the amount of time we spend in our bedrooms, there’s been a lot of focus in recent years on the importance of creating a bedroom environment that’s conducive to sleep, because we know that our bodies take their mental cues from the physical space around us. But this is true for more than just sleep – and can be applied to other rooms or areas too. A paper from the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, which looked at people working from home during the early months of the pandemic, observed that having a dedicated work space and an ergonomic and adjustable workstation led to better physical and mental wellbeing. This indicates that having specific zones for different activities is important, and even seems to apply to where and how we choose to eat our meals. A study published in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity found that children who watched TV during lunch and dinner were more likely to be overweight than those who didn’t, while a paper in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition reported that people who played computer games while they ate felt less full afterwards and were more likely to snack. If a family has a dining table and some chairs, they’re more likely to sit down to a meal together rather than eating in front of the TV or computer, so a meal becomes a sociable time to catch up with each other. Worried you don’t have space? IKEA has plenty of solutions for even the smallest area, from dining tables such as the Norden, which comfortably seats four but folds down to take up no space at all, to the Ingatorp with its drop leaf and cutlery drawer. Nobody’s saying that a folding table is going to keep the family together, but all these things feed into IKEA’s pillars of sanctuary – making great use of space, helping that space function well and contributing to emotional stability. Part of that comes from having a clutter-free, function-focused area, but there are so many other marginal gains to be made around the home when it comes to incrementally improving mood and happiness. Consider the colour of your home furnishings. Extensive research has shown that, as humans, we attach meaning to different colours and that these colours can have an impact on how we feel. One experiment looked at how people responded to the same living room decorated in either reds or blues, and found that red was seen to be exciting and stimulating, while blue invoked feelings of calm and peace. Even when you’ve settled on a shade, you still need to think about lighting – broadly speaking, the more daylight the better – a paper in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine highlighted that the more daylight you have during your working day, the more likely you are to be physically active and to sleep better. But it’s also about the artificial lighting in your home. Yes, of course, it has to be functional – you have to be able to see what you’re doing – but it’s also about the temperature, or the hue. Warmer light has reddish or orange undertones, while cooler light is bluer. Research suggests that cooler light makes workers more productive while warmer light can make people more inclined to help and to resolve conflict. IKEA’s smart lighting solutions allow you to change the hue of the light in your home so it’s perfect for giving you a kickstart in the mornings, or helping you relax at night. However, one of the easiest things you can do to improve your environment, without changing a lightbulb or rearranging your storage, is to bring the outside in. A 2019 review in the Journal of Environmental Horticulture pulled together a wealth of evidence around the ways in which houseplants can improve your emotional and mental health. It seems that houseplants are a shortcut to a happier home, from reducing anxiety to improving creativity, productivity, happiness and life satisfaction. So take your pick, will you go for silvery succulents in cool, white pots or a willowy floor plant that brings an eye-catching splash of green into your home. If you’re feeling lazy, you could easily go faux – and hardly anyone will know as artificial plants are so realistic nowadays. The science is clear – when it comes to affecting our moods and relationships, interior design has the potential to make a huge impact. It’s just a question of knowing what to tweak to make our homes and our lives better. So make 2022 the year that your home becomes a sanctuary that wraps you in love, rather than somewhere you just happen to live.

3/15/2022,"Pixar’s love letter to second-generation Chinese immigrant families, Turning Red, marks a milestone for Hollywood, seemingly signalling the end of its predictably doomed love affair with China. We are now two years on from the backlash against Disney’s live action Mulan remake, a film mired in controversy from its shooting on location near Xinjiang internment camps and thanking members of the Chinese Communist party’s propaganda department, to its title star supporting police violence during protests in Hong Kong in 2019. Subsequent Hollywood-China coproductions saw a similar blowback for this form of kowtowing to China. Dreamworks’ Abominable (2019) was boycotted by Vietnamese and Malaysian audiences for its blatant support of China’s geopolitical ambitions. Netflix’s Over the Moon (2020) was praised for its attempt to represent Chinese culture, but failed at the Chinese box office. Disney’s messy Raya and the Last Dragon (2021), which also performed badly in China, left a sour taste regarding its narrative involving the pursuit of uniting various “warring” kingdoms – a strange though clear nod to Xi Jinping’s centralisation strategy. We are seemingly entering the end of the Hollywood-China relationship, indicative of the ways China has been steadily “decoupling” from the west. Under the guise of its aggressive zero-Covid policy, China has turned inward, leading to the mass exodus of foreigners and foreign partnerships as well placing its future sights on Hong Kong as a place to rebuild a “civil society according to CCP standards”. Taiwan is undoubtedly part of that strategy too. As the box office for American films declines, they are being replaced by bigger budget Chinese films, which model themselves on the Hollywood blockbuster formula. The mood can change quickly: one notable incident involved Academy Award winner Chloé Zhao, who was initially hailed by Chinese state media after the Oscar wins for Nomadland, but the film’s Chinese release was cancelled and social media scrubbed after interview comments about China’s surveillance state resurfaced. Therefore, we now find ourselves in an exciting moment for Hollywood films telling Chinese stories. Turning Red, directed by Domee Shi (who won an Oscar for the beautiful short Bao), is a coming-of-age story following Mei Lee, a precocious Chinese-Canadian teenager as she grapples with the challenges of adolescence and her mother’s overbearing expectations; these manifest as a transformation into a red panda. Throw in a longstanding family curse, 2000s nostalgia and you have an uplifting, universal film which doesn’t pander to any one specific audience. A year ago, Marvel’s Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings was a film I watched with extremely low expectations. But I was elated to find it was not only superbly made, but was also littered with Easter eggs alluding to China’s whitewashing of its own past (including a bus driver’s badge number being the date of the Tiananmen Square massacre). When its Canadian star Simu Liu spoke about the realities of his family’s struggle in communist China – as well as his love of Hong Kong’s lemon tea brand Vitasoy, which was boycotted in China over the stabbing of a Hong Kong police officer – it led to a backlash. Turning Red goes a step further. Its primary language is Cantonese, the co-official language of Hong Kong which the CCP is attempting to suppress – as it did with limiting the use of the Mongolian language in 2020 – as another strategy to control Chinese identity. These moves have not gone unnoticed: Shang Chi was refused a Chinese release, and Turning Red has gone straight on to the Disney+ streaming service which is unavailable in China. So as China continues its unrelenting pursuit of isolating itself from the rest of world, we are now seeing a blossoming of Asian-American cinema. The end of the affair for Hollywood and China may well lead to a promising new future, free from the shackles of kowtowing to an authoritarian regime for money.",Arts/Film,Why ditching the China film market won’t hurt Asian representation on film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/14/why-ditching-the-china-film-market-wont-hurt-asian-representation-on-film
3/15/2022,"There’s a certain sense of comfort when we use the word home. It conjures up a place where we feel cosseted and secure. A house or flat may be where you live, but home means something more – a sanctuary where we’re happy and able to recharge. For many of us, though, a place of sanctuary is not where we’re waking up at the moment. Rising house prices and rents mean that many of us are living in small spaces with limited opportunities to adapt them to suit our needs. A person living in England typically needs to spend nearly eight times their salary to buy a property. At the same time, we’re getting less for our money. When the Local Authority Building Control (LABC) network looked at the average size of UK houses built in every decade since the 1930s, it found that having grown in size, properties are now almost back to where they started, with the average living room built in the 2010s shrinking to 17.09 sq metres. Only a 1930s house was smaller. Yet since the pandemic struck, we have expected more of our living spaces than ever before – they’ve become offices, schools and gyms as well as places to chill and recharge. It’s little surprise that, as lockdown went on, many of us began to crave a place that wasn’t strewn with toys and school worksheets; a desk that wasn’t an ironing board jammed in next to a bed; the smallest patch of garden. Some people seized the initiative and did something about it. In a worldwide survey for IKEA, 60% of people said they’d had to change the way their home was organised as a result of pandemic pressures, and almost half of those felt more positive about their homes as a result. IKEA’s Life at Home report 2021 also found that when we feel good about our homes we feel better about ourselves, with 40% of respondents saying feeling positive improved their mental health. Yet when it comes to our own places, familiarity often stops us being able to pinpoint exactly why we are unhappy with things. Is the sofa in the right place, and what about the wardrobe or chest of drawers? While we’d get a broken window pane fixed quickly, a stiff lock on the bathroom door is easy to overlook, even though it will bug you – subconsciously – several times a day. This year we could again find ourselves spending quite a lot of time at home, not just because of Covid but because rising food and utilities prices could leave us with less cash for fun spending. If we’re going to be at home more, it could be time to think about making it the place we want it to be – a sanctuary that envelops us in a cosy hug. Having noted the link between living spaces and mental health, IKEA identified three “pillars of sanctuary” that can help transform a property into a home. “Our vision is based on creating a better everyday life for many people,” says Marie Tenglund, IKEA’s UK interior design leader. “We believe function and good design are the key to improving any living space in your home.” The first and most basic pillar is function. Is a room fit for purpose? Making an assessment of the space is the first step. What works and what doesn’t? Are you always woken in the morning by light streaming through too thin blinds, for instance? If you swap them for blackout curtains (IKEA’s range starts at £10) or change the position of your bed, you’ll sleep better and life should feel better as you’ve eliminated a source of discomfort. When you work from home, do you have a proper set-up that will prevent you ending up with a strained back? If not, look at adjustable stands for your computer or, if space is at a premium, at desks that fold from the wall. That’s another niggle ticked off the list. Talking of niggles, it’s easy to overlook lots of small jobs around the house, like adding lubricant to that stiff bathroom lock, but they’re worth making time for. Spend 10 minutes sorting out the lock and you’ll avoid a small spike of irritation several times every day. This brings us to emotional stability – the second pillar when it comes to creating a sanctuary – by which IKEA means that homes should induce calm, not make us feel ill at ease. A home you love can help protect your mental wellbeing, IKEA’s report found, so adapting our spaces to fit our new lives is a win in every sense. One major cause of stress can be having too many belongings and the clutter they cause. IKEA’s survey found that, for 27% of people, having a home that was easy to clean and keep clutter-free was more important than 12 months earlier. Clutter is at least within your control. Are you able to set aside time to clear some of it and organise the rest? Look out for clever furniture solutions that can help. Make the most of the vertical space in your room, for instance, with furniture that extends upwards. Also consider pieces that do dual duty: a seat that can function as a trunk or toybox is great for tucking away belongings when they’re not in use. Turning your home into a sanctuary isn’t just about eliminating negatives, it’s also about bringing in joy. Think about doing things that will lift your spirits – from framing a picture you love to buying the coffee maker you’ve always wanted. IKEA’s third pillar of sanctuary is space, which is the trickiest one for many of us – in the 2021 survey, 28% of people said a sense of spaciousness had increased in importance during the pandemic. Even if your home is small, a sense of space can be achieved by looking out for clever design ideas. Tenglund has solutions at her fingertips: “At IKEA we talk a lot about small space living, making the most of the space you have, but maybe it is more appropriate to describe it as smart space living. How can we be smart with the space we have available? How about thinking high, using floor-to-wall space – with a step stool close by to make it easy to reach the items on the top shelf. Think foldable, movable and multifunctional when choosing your furniture to be as flexible and economical with your floor space as possible.” How a room is arranged can have a huge impact too. Having clear routes through can make a world of difference. If you open a door and take two steps before you hit the sofa or need to move a chair to get to a bookcase, a rethink is on the cards. Replanning the layout of your room is a great starting point. You can do this with paper and scissors, creating a scale model of your room and its contents, or you can use an online tool. As Tenglund mentions, don’t forget about making the best use of the walls and the backs of doors. Something as simple as an overdoor hanger can free up space and clear away stuff that’s been languishing on the floor or the backs of chairs. So even small changes can bring big rewards, and the sense of achievement you’ll feel when you’ve made your home your own can be elating.

3/15/2022,"The pandemic has made our homes the ultimate multitaskers: they’ve become offices and schools, as well as where we sleep, relax, exercise and pursue our hobbies. To find out how people felt about their homes in these changing times, IKEA carried out a global survey of more than 34,000 people. IKEA’s Life at Home report 2021 revealed that feeling positive about our homes has a beneficial impact on mental wellbeing, gives us a sense of purpose and allows us to look back on what we’ve achieved at the end of each day. Homes have been critical in helping us remain productive, but it hasn’t been easy. A massive 93% of people who took part in the survey said that it was important that where they lived provided them with a sense of comfort, but only 41% said home was meeting their needs for working and studying. While many parts of our lives may revert back to the way they were, it’s likely that some form of WFH will remain – so how do you preserve home as a place of sanctuary when we’re asking so much else of it? Focus on creating ‘sanctuaries’IKEA believes that the idea of sanctuary is made up of three aspects: function, emotional stability and space. Function asks us to look at whether a room is working as it should; so a kitchen should be used for preparing and enjoying food, while a bedroom needs to promote sleep. Emotional stability requires a room to induce calm, not make us feel ill at ease, so it shouldn’t be cluttered. Then we come to space, which doesn’t mean having somewhere enormous, rather a place that feels roomy through the way it’s lit and its storage solutions. Even a small room can feel big if the space is utilised in a sensible way. Recent times have challenged each of these three pillars of sanctuary differently. Rooms have been made to function in ways they weren’t designed to: we’ve been working in bedrooms, home schooling in kitchens and exercising in sitting rooms. When a room’s function is changed in a way it wasn’t designed for, it can induce a feeling of stress and anxiety. Similarly, a room may no longer promote emotional stability when, say, it becomes cluttered or poor use of space makes users feel claustrophobic, leading to a sense of fear and a lack of control. Know when to switch offThe role of the home has been transformed forever and IKEA found we now want “hybrid spaces for hybrid lifestyles”. With a combination of good daily routines and clever home design, this is possible. But no matter how big your home is, or how it’s arranged, the most important factor in making a hybrid space work is you. You need to prioritise self-care and to mentally – and physically – compartmentalise work and relaxation. Keep regular hours and begin your day with a ritual, whether that’s a cup of coffee or a bowl of cereal, to get into the “work” mindset. Schedule regular breaks and take them in their entirety. At the very least, leave the room you’re working in; ideally leave the house and get outside. Work out when you’re most productive and, if that’s between 9am and 11am, avoid scheduling breaks or meetings during this time, as they will disturb your concentration. You should try to finish at the same time each day, logging off from your work computer and work emails and not looking at either until the following morning. Get creative with your homeThere are plenty of home solutions that will help make this compartmentalising much easier to achieve, and IKEA’s Life at Home report found that 60% of those surveyed have significantly changed the way their home is organised during the pandemic. Ideally, we’d all have a separate home office but, if you don’t, a room’s function can be altered to better serve several uses. If your bedroom or living room has to double up as an office, think creatively about making the best use of the space. Having a separate zone for work will help you define the boundaries between work and home. You can achieve this either by the arrangement of furniture or the use of colours – you could try decorating the wall in front of your desk, for instance. To further emphasise the distinction, it might be worth buying a room divider or curtain, or getting a wall-mounted table that can be dropped down at the end of each day. If it’s storage you’re after, a small drop-leaf table with integrated drawers works brilliantly as a desk without taking up too much space. Alternatively, store all your work items in a box, basket or trolley that can be moved out of sight when you’ve finished so it can’t distract you after work. Wherever you’re working, splash out on an office chair that’s supportive. Your back will thank you later. Deal with the clutterIn IKEA’s report, 27% said that their ideal home would be easy to clean and that keeping it clutter-free was more important to them than it had been a year earlier. Declutter by setting aside 10 minutes each day to tidy up your office area; you’ll feel more in control of things, and it will boost your mental wellbeing. Your desk should only contain what’s essential for working, helping you to focus and preventing distractions, so it might be worth having a desk tidy to keep everything well organised. Hanging peg boards and cork boards are perfect for pinning papers and organising ideas without taking up precious desk space, and wires can be kept neat with cable clips to prevent tangles. Alongside all this organising, you want to make sure your home still feels warm, welcoming – and still your sanctuary. A scented candle or a house plant is a great way to encourage a sense of calm. And get creative with your wall art to reflect your personality. Make the most of your spaceWhen it comes to space, 28% of those questioned said it was one of the things that has grown most in importance. While we can’t magic up square footage, multifunctional furniture, such as sofa beds with drawers, modular storage systems or coffee tables with storage, will make you feel that you have less clutter and more space to play around with. Taking your storage vertical is an easy way to maximise space, so look to wall-to-ceiling shelving or bookcases. If you have large amounts of paperwork, invest in a small filing cabinet and a large bin. If space is particularly tight, tuck away your papers in attractive storage boxes that can sit on any shelf. Keep things brightHow a room is lit will also add to the feeling of space. There’s no real substitute for natural light and its health benefits, so make sure blinds or curtains can be pulled right up or back to let in maximum daylight. For shorter winter days, opt for a variety of lighting options, including space-saving wall lights on swing arms, and stylish desk and table lamps, so wherever in the room you are, there’s plenty of light to work with. If you can, how about putting a slim desk by a window to bring the outside in? We’ve asked so much of our homes recently, it’s not surprising that the primary thing we want from them, a place of sanctuary, has come under threat. As we adapt where we live, we need to keep in mind the importance of function, emotional stability and space so we can ensure that working from home – and relaxing from home – successfully coexist alongside each other. With clever and creative solutions, the hybrid home can work for you. Discover more at IKEA.com",Discover your home sanctuary,Is work taking over your home?
