12/30/2021,"In August, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, wrote: “This is what living with Covid is all about. The case numbers will likely rise when we soon begin to open up. That is inevitable. But our focus needs to be on the rate of people being hospitalised”. Well, he was spot on with respect to case numbers rising. The trouble is, that they have risen much faster than expected.  The University of New South Wales recently reported modelling showing that 25,000 cases a day for NSW were possible by the end of January. This was of course dismissed by Morrison, who said this was not realistic. With 12,226 cases for the state on Thursday, it not only looks very realistic, but is most likely an underestimate. Even if Omicron is milder than Delta, with thousands of cases a day, hospitalisations and ICU admissions will inevitably rise. We are already seeing this in NSW. And when he wrote about living with Covid, Morrison failed to mention that many infected people end up with long-term health problems, a condition we call long Covid (or post-Covid-19 condition). Although most people infected with Covid-19 return to normal health after their infection, more than a third may still have health problems three to six months after recovery. Those most at risk of long Covid include people aged over 50, females, and those with chronic health conditions and obesity. Having a psychiatric or an immunosuppressive condition also increases your risk. There is some evidence that the severity of the initial Covid-19 infection doesn’t seem to affect the chance of you getting long Covid, although there are mixed findings on this. If you are unfortunate to end up with long Covid, common symptoms include abnormal breathing, constant fatigue, malaise, sore chest, sore throat, heart abnormalities, headache, muscle pain, abdominal problems, nerve pain, insomnia, dizziness, brain fog, anxiety and depression. In fact, just about any organ in your body can be damaged by the virus. On a more cheerful note, at least one study has found that children are less likely to get long Covid. We are still learning about long Covid and all of the studies referenced above have been on previous variants. Unfortunately, because Omicron has only been around a few weeks, it is too early to know whether the new variant will be just as bad for long Covid. The Australian Medical Research Future Fund is about to fund one or more major studies of long Covid in Australia, so more information will become available in the next two to three years. Like Australia, many European countries have gone through the same route of reopening and trying to live with Covid-19. But Prof Martin McKee, a European public health expert at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, is critical of the French and UK governments’ responses and disbanding of public health measures. He wants to return the focus to cases, and on bringing cases down to as low a level as possible, rather than simply trying to live with the virus. This doesn’t necessarily mean lockdowns, although McKee points out that these have been very effective in Austria and the Netherlands, albeit for the Delta variant. He argues that the focus now should be on public health measures like improved air filtration and ventilation. What a sensible idea. Unfortunately, the Australian government rarely learns from other countries. Meanwhile, the elephant in the room called long Covid is still there, but quite invisible to our politicians.

12/30/2021,"Australia’s independent expert group OzSage has savaged the “let it rip” Covid-19 strategy in New South Wales and elsewhere, saying it will condemn some people to death, particularly the more vulnerable. In a report released on Thursday, OzSage said the trajectory of Covid data suggested hospital admission and intensive care unit occupancy numbers were “on a steeply rising trend and anticipated to exceed earlier peaks quite soon. In other words, optimistic assumptions about the impact of the Omicron variant on hospital admissions are unrealistic.”  The report said “a fatalistic approach will be fatal for some people”, with NSW in the frontline. “The ‘let it rip’ strategy and defeatist narrative that ‘we are all going to get it’ ignores the stark lived reality of the vulnerable of our society,” the report said. “Despite three doses of vaccine, some patients with cancer and other immunosuppressed people, have substantially reduced protection against Omicron,” it said, noting that about half of the adult population had co-existing health conditions. On Wednesday the NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, repeated his statement initially made on Boxing Day that “we’re all going to get” Covid as a result of the Omicron variant. The OzSage authors, who include the University of NSW’s Prof Raina MacIntyre, criticised the rhetoric from leaders such as the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, who have argued that the media and others should no longer focus on the raw daily case numbers, because hospitalisation rates are so much lower than during the Delta wave when many fewer people were vaccinated. “Daily case numbers are now 10 times higher than during the Delta wave and may be 100 times higher in January” the OzSage report notes. “Even if hospitalisation rates are lower with Omicron compared to Delta, a halving of hospitalisation rates with a 10-fold or 100-fold increase in cases will still translate to a high burden on the health system,” it said. “This is likely to overwhelm the health system, with regional services at particular risk.” The report also blasted “quick-fix adjustments” such as discouraging people from seeking Covid tests if they don’t feel symptoms, to reduce pressure on what remains of the test and trace system. The result would be an increased burden on the health system, the report said, “because it will result in chains of transmission that could otherwise have been stopped”.

Hospitalisation numbers also jumped by about one-fifth to 746 in the state, although those in ICU edged up only marginally. Victoria also reported a sizeable jump in new cases, rising about one-third in a day to 5,137. The state also registered 13 deaths. Australia could reach 100,000 daily cases within weeks, Michael Lydeamore, a Monash University modeller, said on Wednesday. While Omicron infections appear to be 40-45% less likely to result in hospitalisations of those inflected, the sheer scale of the cases along with a health system already fatigued from almost two years of battling Covid meant the impact of the current wave “could be enormous”, the OzSage report said. “The rapid rise in Omicron cases may mean we are only days away from seeing higher hospitalisation and ICU admissions than during the peak of Delta,” the group said. As wards reached capacity and more people contracted Covid without getting access to hospital care, more people might die in their homes, OzSage said. “One week ago, NSW Health advised people under 50 years to care for themselves at home, without access to Hospital in The Home,” it said. “This week, they have revised the age cut off to anyone under 65 years. This is the ultimate in ‘personal responsibility’. “The consequence of this policy is that people may die at home when their lives could have been saved by proper timely healthcare,” it said, noting that during the Delta wave, the mean age of those dying at home from Covid was about 40. “During any other time, this would have been a national scandal, but it passed without comment or scrutiny from policy makers and health authorities,” it said. The report does not directly criticise the federal government, but Scott Morrison has repeatedly stressed management of the pandemic in the latest phase is becoming a matter of “personal responsibility” rather than restrictions imposed by governments.",News/Australia news,OzSage experts warn ‘let it rip’ Covid strategy will condemn vulnerable Australians to death,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/30/ozsage-experts-warn-let-it-rip-covid-strategy-will-condemn-vulnerable-australians-to-death
