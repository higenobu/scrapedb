3/9/2022,"Poland has said it will hand over its MiG-29 fighter jets to the US, which is then expected to donate them to Ukraine amid intelligence agency warnings that Vladimir Putin is about to “double down” in his invasion. The Polish foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, said his government was “ready to deploy – immediately and free of charge – all their MiG-29 jets to the Ramstein air base and place them at the disposal of the government of the United States of America”. Poland is thought to have 28 of the Soviet-era warplanes, and has been in negotiation with the Biden administration on a three-way deal to supply Ukraine with air power, on condition that the MiGs would be replaced by newer US jets. The deal has the effect of sharing the risk of Russian retaliation with the US, which will decide how and when to hand them to the Ukrainian air force. “Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities,” Rau said in a statement on his ministry’s website. “Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes.” Rau requested other Nato allies with MiG-29 jets – a reference to Slovakia and Bulgaria – to “act in the same vein”. Poland announced the deal as US officials said the war in Ukraine had reached a pivotal moment, with Russia sustaining severe losses but with Putin determined to press on. “I think the next couple of days are going to be critical for both the humanitarian situation and also for the tide of this war,” Michael Carpenter, the US ambassador to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), told the Guardian. US intelligence agencies told Congress on Tuesday that they tentatively estimated that 2,000-4,000 Russian soldiers had been killed so far, but that Putin would persevere in the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance. “We assess Putin feels aggrieved the west does not give him proper deference and perceives this as a war he cannot afford to lose,” the US director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, told the House intelligence committee. Carpenter quoted the Ukrainian foreign minister as saying Ukraine will win – but at what price? “I think that is the question that we’re all asking ourselves, and what can we possibly do to get humanitarian relief to those in need, and to force the Russians to abide by some sort of ceasefire and respect for humanitarian corridors,” he said. But Carpenter cautioned: “I have to say it’s so difficult because the cynicism on the Russian side is just unbelievable.” The CIA director, William Burns, predicted “an ugly next few weeks” in Ukraine, in which the Russian leader would escalate the war “with scant regard for civilian casualties”. Haines said US officials believe Putin “is unlikely to be deterred … and instead may escalate – essentially doubling down to achieve Ukrainian disarmament and neutrality to prevent it from further integrating with the US and Nato if it doesn’t reach some diplomatic negotiation”. Carpenter said that US and allied weapons supplies were still getting through to the Ukrainian army. “I don’t want to get into too many specifics as to how we’re getting our security assistance to the Ukrainians who are using it, but I can tell you that that pipeline is open, and we’re dedicated to giving them what they need to be able to defend themselves,” he said. The Ukrainian government of Volodymyr Zelenskiy has placed great importance on the delivery of fighter jets, but US officials and military experts have expressed scepticism over how decisive MiG-29s can be, particularly as Russian forces have substantial anti-aircraft missile systems. “I don’t want to focus too much on one particular system. Ukraine has a lot of needs,” Carpenter said. “Certainly combat aircraft could help but there’s a lot of other systems that could be useful in terms of degrading Russian air power and preventing the vast bulk of the civilian casualties, which are resulting from long-range fires.” A senior US defence official said that Russian armed forces were stepping up their pressure on Kyiv, with intensified bombing to disrupt life in the capital and possibly lay the groundwork for a full-scale assault. The US assesses Russia has lost about 5% of the tanks, artillery and other military equipment it brought into Ukraine, and that it still has the “vast majority” of its short-range, surface-to-air missiles and artillery available. The US official also said the Pentagon believes Russia has prepared up to 11 tank landing ships in the Black Sea for future amphibious assaults on the Ukrainian coast.",News/World news,Poland to give MiG-29 jets to US for expected donation to Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/poland-mig-29-jets-us-ukraine
3/9/2022,"In a video address without precedent, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy appeared in front of a packed House of Commons. He looked tired, and determined, and painfully human. He was not seeking to persuade MPs with his rhetoric, nor to make a complicated case, he wasn’t there as a supplicant or a showman. He only wanted to know, beyond any shade of doubt, that the world could see what was happening to Ukraine. He didn’t want to be your hero. He could not help but be your hero. MPs are not supposed to applaud in the House of Commons. It’s one of their many alienating conventions, the cause of their hear-hears and other dumb noises. What a powerful shock it was to see the chamber on its feet and clapping. You become so used to politics as theatre, and suddenly the actors are also devastated, also mystified as to what comes next. Zelenskiy took the house carefully through what’s come already. The first day of invasion, they were attacked by cruise missiles. Everybody woke up, and they haven’t slept since. There was something deliberately prosaic about his language, inviting, demanding that we put ourselves in his place and the place of Ukrainians. They’re not superheroes, they had no advance knowledge or special warlike gifts, they didn’t have a plan B for the day, if it turned out to involve cruise missiles. They did what we all would, they woke up, and they haven’t slept since. Day two, their “heroic military servicemen tried to fight”, the Russians demanded they lay down their arms, they carried on fighting. The president’s careful chronology underlined a few things; every day is an atrocity, every day is an escalation, every day is harder. “On day five,” he said, mutedly, “the terror against us was against children, against cities. Constant shelling took place around the country. And that didn’t break us.” The Russian rockets fell on Babyn Yar, 80 years after the Nazi atrocities it commemorates; Zelenskiy’s face was enough to hammer home the gravity of the thematic throughline. And then on day eight, “we have seen Russian tanks hitting the atomic power station and everybody has to understand that this is terror against everyone”. There followed the Nato meeting, the limitations of the international response, even as he underlines his gratitude for it. But the shelling and the rockets are ceaseless, the children and cities are still being hit. There are now 50 children who “would be alive, but these people have taken them from us”. So now, for 13 days, they’ve faced the question, Zelenskiy said: to be or not to be? “Now I can give you a definitive answer: it’s definitely yes; to be.” He thanked Boris Johnson for the sanctions, appealed for support, one great country to another. The prime minister’s response was sombre – “I believe he has moved the hearts of everybody in this house” – with a topnote of something like empathy, something like terror. “In a great European capital, now within range of Russian guns, Zelenskiy stands for freedom.” Starmer praised the president’s courage, pledged support for arms, solidarity, ever tougher sanctions, international unity. Ian Blackford vowed that this would end in failure for Putin, that the world would see him in front of an international court, though the line between a promise and a dear hope, here, was plainly demarcated. Ed Davey echoed his plangent optimism when he called for Zelenskiy to be awarded an honorary knighthood, and hoped to see him in person in the house when the world allowed. Jeffrey Donaldson, leader of the DUP, didn’t get the memo of the refugee question being held at one remove and underlined the demands of humanitarianism. The question was skirted, one assumes, because it would feel petty, at such a time, to admit any shard of difference between one party and another. I doubt this question feels petty to 2 million people who have already been displaced. Zelenskiy had ended echoing Churchill: “We will not give up. We will not lose. We will fight to the end, at sea, in the air, we will continue fighting for our land whatever the cost. We will fight in the forests and the fields, on the shores, on the street. I would like to add that we will fight on the banks of different rivers. And we are looking for your help. For the help of civilised countries.” The variations, the immediacy, brought vividly to life the jeopardy and sadness, the sheer kick in the head of history resurfacing as current affairs.",News/Politics,Zelenskiy brings down the house with his speech to the Commons | Zoe Williams,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/08/zelenskiy-brings-down-the-house-with-his-speech-to-the-commons
3/9/2022,"Apple has announced a new version of its cheapest iPhone, an updated iPad Air tablet and a new powerful professional desktop computer called the Mac Studio. During a livestreamed event on Tuesday, Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook also announced that the firm would begin showing Friday night Major League Baseball games on its Apple TV+ service in the US, UK, Australia and other markets. The new cut-price iPhone brings the “SE” model more up to date with Apple’s latest A15 processor, longer battery life and 5G connectivity The new SE keeps the same look as its 2020 predecessor with Touch ID home button and a 4.7in LCD screen with large bezels top and bottom – a body design first introduced with the iPhone 8 in 2017. The updated phone has an improved 12-megapixel rear camera, but lacks the multiple lenses available on Apple’s more expensive models. What the iPhone SE lacks in modern design it makes up for in value, likely to be supported with software for up to seven years, which is as much as five years longer than similarly priced rivals. Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight, said: “Apple’s ability to offer devices with a longer life span, and in some cases with multiple owners over a lifetime, makes its devices more sustainable than those that become obsolete after as little as two years when software and security updates end.” The third-generation iPhone SE will cost £419 in the UK and $429 in the US and will ship on 18 March. Apple also updated its mid-range tablet, the iPad Air. It was last updated in 2020 with slimmed-down design, 10.9in screen and Touch ID fingerprint scanner in the power button. The new 2022 model is made from recycled aluminium and is up to 60% faster than its predecessor, equipped with the M1 chip from the iPad Pro and the MacBook Air laptop as well as optional 5G. The front-facing video call camera now has Apple’s “centre stage” technology, which automatically pans and scans to keep video call participants in-shot without having to move the iPad about. The fifth-generation iPad Air will cost from £569 in the UK and $599 in the US and will ship on 18 March. The new Mac Studio is a small but powerful desktop computer, aimed at developers, videographers and creative professionals that do not want a built-in screen. The new machine is still a compact, like the Mac mini, but is now taller with a body made of 80% recycled aluminium. It has Apple’s new M1 Ultra processor, which is essentially two of the previous top M1 Max chips bolted together making it 60% faster than the Mac Pro. It supports up to 256GB of unified memory and has up to six Thunderbolt 4/USB 4 ports, two traditional USB ports and an HDMI for connecting displays. To go with it Apple also announced a new 27in 5K external monitor made of recycled aluminium. The Studio Display has an embedded A13 chip, previously used in iPhones, a 12-megapixel Centre Stage camera and three mics for video calls, plus a six-speaker sound system. The Mac Studio will ship from 18 March costing from £1,999 in the UK and $1,999 in the US, but models with the M1 Ultra will cost £3,999 or $3,999.

3/9/2022,"Good morning. Strong winds are expected to cause more chaos in New South Wales today as the flooding crisis continues to affect Australia’s east coast. Tens of thousands of residents across Sydney have been forced from their homes after the floods unleashed carnage and claimed the lives of a mother and son. Farther north, permanent residents in caravan parks have been devastated by flood water, and with many unable to afford insurance against increasingly common inundations, they have no option but to stay and rebuild. “We just get ourselves up, shake ourselves off, and start all over again,” said resident Heather Emmett. State and federal MPs from both sides of politics have called for the planned commonwealth cyclone reinsurance scheme to be expanded to cover floods and fires. Now the clean-up has begun for many flood-affected communities, fears are being raised about the impact of the mountains of waste, with questions over a NSW government plan to store the rotting mounds at a quarry. Russia has been accused of violating a ceasefire by shelling the humanitarian corridor to the besieged city of Mariupol, as the number of people fleeing Ukraine passes 2 million. “The enemy has launched an attack heading exactly at the humanitarian corridor,” the Ukrainian defence ministry said on Facebook, adding that the Russian army “did not let children, women and elderly people leave the city”. It’s not the only incident of Russian soldiers targeting civilians, with multiple allegations of the use of deadly fire on civilian vehicles across Ukraine. The price of fuel and food in Australia is set to rise, economists have warned, as the Russian invasion of Ukraine will likely have unforeseen impacts on the Australian economy. Australia’s relative dependence among rich nations on commodity exports leaves it exposed to sharp swings in international markets. More costly commodities would be noticed at Australians’ kitchen tables and when they head to the service station, with prices predicted to jump to as much as $2.50 a litre for petrol. Anthony Albanese will use a speech at a business summit on Wednesday to bemoan a lost decade of division and policy inertia under the Coalition and present himself as a consensus figure with a “renewal” agenda. Albanese will call for an end to the climate and culture wars and look for collaborative opportunities between governments, trade unions, businesses and civil society around “shared aims of growth and job creation”. The climate crisis is increasing the risk of food shortages “all the way through the supply chain, from farm to warehouse to supermarket shelves”, according to the author of a new report for Farmers for Climate Action. A Victorian man in his 60s has died from the Japanese encephalitis virus, prompting authorities to warn Australians to take the risk of the mosquito-borne disease seriously. The UN human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, will make a long-delayed visit to China in May, including to Xinjiang, where activists and western lawmakers say Beijing is subjecting Uyghur people to genocide. Influencers, TV presenters and sports stars would no longer be able to advertise unhealthy food and drink to children in Spain, under a new proposal. Octopuses are increasingly using discarded bottles, cans, and other human rubbish as shelter or as a sanctuary for their eggs, according to new study. The US Senate has unanimously passed a bill to make lynching a federal hate crime, after more than 200 attempts failed over more than a century. “I grievously miss (and suspect I always will) the loss of 30 years’ worth of collected earrings,” says writer and commentator Jane Caro, recounting the items she most regrets losing. “Our house was broken into a few years ago and the thief snatched my jewellery box off my dressing table … I have begun amassing another collection, of course, but it’s not the 80s.” Even though the borders are open, in the uncertain soup of the pandemic international travel still remains a fantasy for many of us. So the next best thing may be to watch a television show about people travelling around Europe – like Us, a four-part series streaming now on ABC’s iView. But instead of being the next best thing to a trip to Europe, Us is a nightmare journey, where the viewer accompanies a married couple and their adult son Albie as their family implodes. Many parts of Australia’s east coast are enduring a record wet start to the year, with frequent deluges and storms. In these conditions, mould thrives. And if not dealt with, mould growth can have adverse effects on health. We spoke to the experts on how to prevent mould taking hold, and what to do if it already has. With the federal election due to be called in a few weeks, it’s still unclear who will be running for the Liberal party in some pivotal NSW seats.

3/9/2022,"The UK’s announcement that it will phase out Russian oil imports by the end of the year is set to have an impact on consumers already feeling the pain from surging inflation and high energy and fuel bills. The government also said it was exploring options to end Russian supplies of natural gas to the UK, which make up less than 4% of the country’s supply. Here’s what the UK’s move to replace the 8% of Russian oil could do to bills: Household energy bills are already set to go up in April, and the new move could mean bigger rises are set to come later in the year, by putting more pressure on oil and gas prices. Brent crude jumped to $133 per barrel on Tuesday, close to the 14-year high hit on Monday. The good news of sorts for households with standard gas and electricity supplies is that the Ofgem energy price cap that applies to bills stops providers from putting up variable tariffs any time soon. The higher price cap that takes effect on 1 April will be in place until the end of September. The cap will be updated in August, with the new ceiling taking effect from the start of October – so a lot will depend on the state of the energy market at that point. Some experts had already suggested that average annual bills could go reach £3,000, and this latest announcement heightens the chance of that happening. Even if the wholesale cost of gas has gone down by the summer, in the shorter term rising prices will put pressure on suppliers. If more go to the wall, there could be greater costs in the pipeline for customers. Standing charges for electricity are going up by around 80% in some cases in April to cover the cost of last year’s energy company collapses, and if more go bust, the cost of looking after their customers will filter through to bills eventually. For those off the gas grid, the pain will be much quicker to hit home. Heating oil prices have rocketed in recent days – according to the website BoilerJuice, the average price of a litre of heating oil had gone up from 66.77p on 23 February to 117.83p on Monday. A squeeze on global supply will push that up. Gas and oil prices are a big factor in how much we pay for food, and if they continue to go up, so will the cost of groceries. Fertiliser prices have surged on the back of rising gas prices, and will mean farmers need to charge more for everything they produce. Cooking oil prices have already gone up, with one of the drivers being demand for the crops for biodiesel. Soaring oil prices will add to that pressure. Rising prices for cooking oil will have a knock-on impact on all kinds of foodstuffs – margarine, peanut butter and long life cream are just some of the products that contain it. The move will put yet more upwards pressure on prices at the pump, which – it was revealed on Tuesday – have just gone up by the biggest weekly amount for years. The cost of filling up a 55-litre family car has gone up by more than £2 in a week, according to government data going up to close of play on Monday 7 March. “Russia is our biggest source of diesel outside the UK, supplying 18% in 2020 but hovering around 15-20% annually,” according to a report in Autocar. However, the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said that “more than two-thirds of our road fuel comes from domestic production”. The new move will be phased in over several months, giving the markets a fair bit of time to adjust, and allowing for alternative suppliers to be found, though whether that is enough to stop motorists panic-buying remains to be seen. The average price of a litre of petrol at UK forecourts rose from 149.2p on February 28 to 153p on Monday (7 March), according to BEIS, while average diesel prices rose from 153.4p to 158.6p over the same period. Rising inflation would usually mean higher interest rates. The Bank of England is tasked with keeping inflation at 2% – however, the annual rate of price growth had already reached 5.5% ahead of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and rising petrol and food prices will push it up further, with some economists predicting inflation of almost 9% by the end of the year. But the Bank will be aware that households face higher costs, and may decide not to pile on more pressure by raising borrowing costs rapidly, as some have been predicting. When it meets next week, it could opt to raise rates from 0.5% to 0.75%, rather than to 1% as some commentators have predicted. If the bank does increase rates, that will add to mortgage costs for those on variable-rate home loans, and could push up the price of new personal loans. Fixed-rate mortgages have been so cheap that most homeowners and landlords have them, and so they will be shielded in the short-term at least from rising costs.",Lifestyle/Money,What does action over Russian oil and gas mean for UK consumers?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/08/what-does-action-over-russian-oil-and-gas-mean-for-uk-consumers
3/9/2022,"Todd Boehly and Hansjörg Wyss have submitted their offer to buy Chelsea but they are yet to convince Roman Abramovich to sell the club to their consortium. Abramovich put Chelsea up for sale last week and is considering how to proceed after receiving an opening proposal from the consortium fronted by Boehly and Wyss. The size of the offer remains unknown but is unlikely to be significantly higher than £2bn. Wyss, an 86-year-old Swiss billionaire, has gone on the record to say that Abramovich’s asking price is too high. It has been reported that Abramovich, who has faced calls in parliament for him to be hit with sanctions since the invasion of Ukraine, is looking for as much as £4bn. It remains to be seen whether the Russian, who is keen for a sale to go through quickly, will accept a significantly lower fee. Beyond the finances, Wyss and Boehly must convince Abramovich, who bought Chelsea in 2003, that they are the right people to take the club forward. One well-placed figure suggesting that Abramovich is unsure about selling to them. Wyss and Boehly, who part-owns the LA Dodgers, are sitting tight as they await a response. The identities of the other figures who have formed their consortium remain unknown. Abramovich, who vehemently denies allegations linking him to Vladimir Putin and the Russian state or that he has done anything to merit sanctions, has appointed the New York-based bank Raine to oversee the sale. Interested parties have been given until 15 March to submit bids. It is unlikely Abramovich would be permitted to sell Chelsea if the UK government imposed sanctions on him. Born in Bern, Switzerland, 19 September 1935. He studied engineering, earned an MBA from Harvard, then worked in textiles in Asia and Europe. As a sideline he sold planes – with one sale introducing him to the co-founder of the Swiss medical device manufacturer Synthes. Wyss went on to found Synthes USA in 1977 and, in 2012, he sold it to Johnson & Johnson for $19.7bn (£14.8bn). What is he worth now? A more modest $5.8bn (£4.3bn), having, in 2013, signed the Giving Pledge set up by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, committing to give away most of his fortune. His Wyss Foundation – focused on environmentalism and progressive, anti-Trump politics – holds over $2bn in assets. In 2018 he pledged to donate $1bn (£751m) to environmental causes.  Any controversies? His financial influence on US politics, as a non-US citizen, has drawn criticism – but he remains focused on pushing an anti-populist agenda. Asked about Brexit in 2019, Wyss told Swiss paper Neue Zürcher Zeitung how voters had been “deceived by populist statements... For the British people’s sake, I hope that there will be another vote when all the facts are on the table.”  So why Chelsea? He hasn’t shared his vision, but the 86-year-old Wyoming resident isn’t going it alone, with the part-owner of the LA Dodgers, Todd Boehly, forming part of a consortium. Boehly, an investor, billionaire and fellow philanthropist, had a solo takeover bid for Chelsea rejected in 2019 and has previously been linked with Tottenham. He told Bloomberg at the time: ""One of the great things the Premier League has is that it’s on a Saturday morning in America. So you have an uncongested time slot that is now fully dominated by the Premier League. When I was growing up, Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, but certainly I didn’t know about Manchester United, I didn’t know about Chelsea, I didn’t know about Tottenham. Kids these days are fully aware of what’s the best and the Premier League is the best. I continue to believe there is a global opportunity for the best clubs.” David Hills There has been speculation that Chelsea’s next owners will come from America. Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets, is reportedly readying a bid. However Muhsin Bayrak, a Turkish businessman, last week signalled his interest in buying Chelsea and on Tuesday said he would hold further talks with Abramovich’s representatives on Thursday. The uncertainty at Chelsea could have an impact on contract negotiations with Antonio Rüdiger, Andreas Christensen and César Azpilicueta. Barcelona are close to signing Christensen on a free, although Bayern Munich have not pulled out of the race for the Denmark defender. Barça are also confident Azpilicueta will strengthen their defence on a free.",Sport/Football,Wyss and Boehly submit Chelsea bid but Abramovich not yet convinced to sell,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/08/hansjorg-wyss-and-todd-boehly-submit-chelsea-bid-roman-abramovich-not-yet-convinced-to-sell
3/9/2022,"Family members should help loved ones to quit smoking, adopt better diets and stop taking drugs to help relieve the huge pressure on the NHS, the health secretary has said. Sajid Javid urged relatives to do what they could to persuade each other to lead healthier lives so the health service could better cope with the rising tide of illness it is facing. In a major speech on Tuesday, he said families needed to play a key role in preventing ill-health because demographic trends meant the NHS in years to come could buckle under the strain of treating a growing number of older people with several illnesses. The NHS also had to do a lot more to stop people becoming unwell in the first place, he added, and no longer be just a “national hospital service” as a way of tackling its “unsustainable finances”, because its budget was taking up an ever larger share of public spending. Drawing on his family history, Javid said: “When I was around five, my dad was a smoker – a lot more people were back then. I remember standing at the top of the staircase overhearing my mum confront him, saying: ‘If you die, your boys won’t have a dad.’ He never smoked again. “That kind of intervention is more powerful than most of us can imagine. Whether it’s stopping drug addiction or dealing with depression, there’s no more powerful motivating force than family.” Javid said that although his father had died years later of colon cancer, he wondered “if, by stopping smoking in his early 30s, it gave us much more time together as a family”. Conversations with relatives could help people eat more healthily too, he said. In a speech billed as the NHS’s “road to recovery” after two years of the Covid pandemic Javid said that “we must choose between endlessly putting in more and more money or reforming how we do healthcare. I choose reform. I want us to shift to a new mode of operating, one that’s about helping the whole population to stay healthy, not just treating those who show up asking for help.” He pointed out that while health spending accounted for 27% of public spending in 2000, that would increase to 44% by 2024 on current trends, which could not continue. Pledging to make the NHS “fit for the 21st century” he outlined plans for an expansion of personal health budgets, much greater personalisation of care, closer integration between the NHS and social care, and easier access for patients to NHS care, including via the NHS app. But Nigel Edwards, the chief executive of the Nuffield Trust thinktank, warned Javid that rising healthcare costs were a feature of western countries the UK was unlikely to avoid. “There is no evidence that cost pressures on the NHS are unsustainable,” said Edwards. “How much of our wealth we choose to spend on healthcare is a matter of political choice. In developed countries across the world, governments are spending more on health services as the population ages and lives with more and more chronic conditions, and it is hard to see the UK bucking this trend any time soon.” The British Medical Association’s chair of council, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, said Javid had “omitted the most fundamental element of any recovery strategy, which is tackling the chronic workforce shortages in the NHS”. Javid admitted that the long-term workforce plan that he had asked NHS England to draw up would take a year to appear, despite the urgency of the widespread staffing problems that were blighting every area of care and calls from NHS groups for quicker action.",News/Politics,Javid calls on families to help NHS by pushing loved ones to improve health,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/08/sajid-javid-families-help-nhs-pushing-loved-ones-improve-health
3/9/2022,"The soaring cost of driving in the UK is forcing people to scrimp on food and heating, as turmoil in energy markets puts petrol prices on course to hit a new milestone of 160p a litre. Simon Williams, the RAC’s fuel spokesperson, said the speed at which fuel prices are rising means petrol is on a “rapid journey towards 160p a litre and diesel to 165p”. “Given the speed of increases, drivers could unfortunately see this by the end of the week. As these are averages, far higher prices will be appearing on forecourt totems up and down the country.” The petrol price is linked to global oil prices which have jumped on the back of the war in Ukraine. The price of Brent crude is now above $130 a barrel, having hit $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014 when Russia began its assault. We spoke to readers about how the higher price of petrol and diesel is affecting their lives. Bowater drives roughly 1,000 miles a month to and from work and says the high cost of fuel is forcing him to make big changes, including cutting meat from his diet and keeping the heating turned off. “I used to put £24 or £25 [of diesel] in a week and it’s gone up to about £36,” the 52-year-old said. He considered getting a train instead but the journey cost even more, at “£20-odd pounds a day”, and took a lot longer at an hour and 40 minutes, compared with a half-hour drive. “Normally I’ll buy things like beef or chicken or pork – I’ve had to cut it all out, I’m not having meat at all,” he said. “It’s not healthy food that I’m swapping it for, it’s all carbohydrates, which is no good. “I live on my own – I can go without putting the heating on but can’t go without diesel. If I have visitors over, I’ll put it on for them if it’s cold out. I’ve never ever had to do anything like this in my life.” If the price of fuel keeps rising, as some analysts predict it will, Bowater said he may have to think about getting a second job to boost his income. White, who lives with his partner and four children in a rural village, said higher fuel costs meant his family had to drop extracurricular activities for their two autistic children. Between commutes, the school run and supermarket trips, he and his wife drive 300 miles a week. “Every day I drive past, it’s gone up another penny,” he says. The couple, who own two cars – one diesel, one petrol – used to spend £30 a month on petrol “but now it’s £40”. The amount spent on diesel has jumped from £30-£40 a week to £50. “The kids’ clubs and activities have been cut because we just can’t afford to get them there any more,” he said. Using public transport is not an option because his children cannot cope with the crowds and noise. “We don’t go away,” he said of lifestyle changes the family has had to make. “We used to go through to Glasgow to visit my granny. We can’t do that any more because we just can’t afford to take the car out.” The reader, who withheld his name, used to see friends every week but has now reduced that to “once a month or so” to save money on fuel; however, the reduced social contact has left him feeling isolated. “I feel that my mental health is gradually deteriorating as I’m constantly having to think about nearly every single trip I’m making in my car,” he said. “I used to visit my friends at least twice a week and now I’m only seeing them once a month or so.” The 44-year-old has also cut down on shopping trips in an effort to save money at a time when his energy bills are also going up. “I’m feeling the squeeze in living standards already and it’s only going to get worse come April [when national insurance contributions increase].”",Lifestyle/Money,‘We don’t visit granny any more’: the social costs of soaring petrol prices,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/08/we-dont-visit-granny-any-more-the-social-costs-of-soaring-petrol-prices
