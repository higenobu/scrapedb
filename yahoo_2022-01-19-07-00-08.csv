""The important thing is that we have societal hero archetypes that we look up to. Jesus is a hero archetype. Superman is a hero archetype. Real characters too,"" Crenshaw said during the interview. The questioner said she couldn't ""wrap my head around this."" ""I can help you,"" Crenshaw responded testily. ""Put a period after 'Jesus,' and don't question my faith."" One person can be heard on the video saying ""Wow!"" in disbelief. Another exclaims, ""You moron!"" while still another adds, ""You don't talk to a kid like that!"" Crenshaw's comments on the podcast appears to have its source in the thought of clinical psychologist and author Jordan Peterson. ""I have a whole chapter [in my book, Fortitude,] on heroism — and frankly I got some of that philosophy from you — on how to build hero archetypes,"" Crenshaw said in an appearance on Peterson's podcast earlier this month. Peterson has referred to Jesus as the ultimate hero archetype but remains agnostic on the questions of Jesus' divinity and resurrection. Ironically, this incident took place the night before some Christians celebrate the Feast of the Confession of St. Peter. The feast commemorates the apostle Peter's declaration that Jesus is ""the Christ, the Son of the living God"" in response to Jesus' question ""Who do you say that I am?"" Crenshaw is a Methodist.

 Former President Trump's lawyers told the Supreme Court that the House committee probing the Jan. 6 attack would suffer no harm if the justices delayed the transfer of Trump administration records to congressional investigators. The bold assertion came amid an ongoing legal clash between Trump and the House panel over whether a trove of records that investigators say would shed light on the deadly Capitol riot are covered by the former president's assertion of executive privilege. Trump's attorneys, in their latest filing, pushed back on the committee's claim that a protracted legal fight threatens to undermine its work. ""Respondents will not be harmed by delay,"" Trump attorneys wrote, referring to the House panel. ""Despite their insistence that the investigation is urgent, more than a year has passed since January 6, 2021. Years remain before the next transition of power."" ""The Committee and the Court have time to make a swift but measured analysis of these important issues and make sure that in the rush to conduct its investigation, the Committee does not do irreparable structural damage in the process,"" they added. The Jan. 6 committee has not established a hard deadline for completing its investigation, but its chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) has said the panel hopes to wrap up by early spring. Trump turned to the Supreme Court last month after lower federal courts in Washington, D.C., rejected his request to halt the National Archives from disbursing the records. His attorneys have asked the justices to shield the disputed materials from disclosure while they consider his formal appeal. In the lower federal courts, judges made quick work in rebuffing Trump's claims. They zeroed in on President Biden's refusal to invoke executive privilege over Trump-era schedules, call logs, emails and other requested documents. Biden declined to do so after determining that the House panel's needs for the records exceeded any benefit of keeping them under wraps. The House panel, for its part, has emphasized the importance of a prompt resolution in the case. ""The Select Committee's work is of the highest importance and urgency: investigating one of the darkest episodes in our nation's history, a deadly assault on the United States Capitol and Congress, and an unprecedented disruption of the peaceful transfer of power from one President to the next,"" they told the justices last month. The prospect of a drawn-out Trump court fight has prompted comparisons to the drain-the-clock litigation strategy he wielded as president, where delay tactics were deployed to stymie lawsuits, hamper investigators and fend off subpoenas, with numerous cases against Trump and his administration still hanging in the balance as he left the White House.",Politics/The Hill,Trump lawyers to Supreme Court: Jan. 6 committee 'will not be harmed by delay',https://news.yahoo.com/trump-lawyers-supreme-court-jan-204536357.html
1/19/2022,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has submitted a proposal to reshape the state's congressional map and carve up districts held by Black Democrats, as the Republican takes the unusual step of inserting himself into the redistricting process. The proposed congressional map, submitted Sunday on the eve of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, signaled the governor's priorities as the state moves to redraw political maps in the coming months. Governors typically do not submit map proposals but can veto district plans after they pass in the statehouse. DeSantis, who is running for reelection and is considered a potential 2024 presidential candidate, has largely shaped the legislative agenda in the Republican-controlled statehouse this year. His office did not immediately return an emailed request for comment on the map. Among other things, the proposal dismantles a north Florida district held by U.S. Rep. Al Lawson, a Democrat, and would break up a south Florida district formerly held by U.S. Rep. Alcee Hastings, another Democrat. A St. Petersburg district held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist would also be carved up, under the governor's plan. Democrats were quick to criticize the governor's proposed map and suggested it could not pass legal muster as currently drafted. “From what I can tell, the governor rolled out his own maps, unrequested, on Martin Luther King Day that will probably end up leaving less African-American representation in Congress,"" Democratic state Rep. Evan Jenne told reporters. Last week, the Senate Reapportion Committee approved a Senate-led congressional map on a nearly unanimous vote, signaling that both parties agree that it is drawn without benefitting a political party or candidate. That plan now moves to the full Senate for a vote. The House Redistricting Committee still needs to approve its version of the congressional map. The Florida Supreme Court in 2015 threw out the state's congressional maps, which were drawn by Republicans, in a ruling that said the maps benefitted the party and were drawn with the help of state Republican party consultants.",Politics/Associated Press,"In unusual move, Gov.

1/19/2022,"LONDON (AP) — A man in northwest England pleaded guilty Tuesday to conspiring to exploiting a vulnerable victim who was found living in a garden shed that had been his home for 40 years. The victim was rescued in October 2018 when officers from the Gangmasters & Labour Abuse Authority searched a trailer park in Carlisle and discovered him living in the shed, which had no light or heat, the agency said. The man, now in his early 60s, told investigators that he worked on farms, doing painting, roofing and paving work for which he was paid as little as 10 pounds ($13.50) a day. The man now lives in supported accommodation in another community. “This is something that even now I struggle to comprehend,” Senior Investigating Officer Martin Plimmer said in a statement. “For four decades he was in effect kept as a slave.” Peter Swailes, 56, pleaded guilty Tuesday to a charge of conspiracy to organize the travel of a person for the purpose of exploiting him.

1/19/2022,"Johannesburg — Only eight weeks after the world first heard about the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, when researchers in South Africa who discovered the strain notified global authorities, that country's wave of infections has fallen as sharply as it climbed. Not only that, but South Africa has weathered its fourth wave of COVID-19 with very little interruption to people's lives. CBS News foreign correspondent Debora Patta reports that in the suburbs of Johannesburg, restaurants are busy again, traffic is jammed, and the city is bustling. Omicron quickly became the focus of global anxiety as infections spread across South Africa with ferocious speed. Within days, the country was at the epicenter of the pandemic. And then… well, not much happened at all. ""A little bit at ease"" Patta and her team have monitored one COVID ward, at a hospital in Gauteng province, which includes the metropolis of Johannesburg and the capital Pretoria, throughout the pandemic. Six months ago, during the country's battle with the Delta variant, the hospital was overwhelmed. ICU beds and oxygen were running out and the death rate was soaring. ""You are a human being before becoming a nurse, so seeing people die like that is very, very hard,"" exhausted nurse Justice Mangala told CBS News at the time. During the Omicron wave, however, it has looked like a completely different hospital. It's about half empty, with very few patients requiring oxygen — and the staff are under a lot less pressure. This time around, Mangala told Patta, he could count the deaths on his ward with one hand. ""I'm a little bit at ease,"" he said, ""now that we have got this second line of defense, which is our vaccine."" ""A turning point in this pandemic"" The vaccines, combined with high rates of previous infection, have boosted South Africa's collective immunity to the coronavirus, according to vaccinologist Professor Shabir Madhi, and that has dramatically reduced the rates of severe illness and death during the fourth wave. CDC says unvaccinated 11-times more likely to die of COVID ""The Omicron wave now accounts for less than 5% of all of the deaths that have occurred due to COVID-19 [in South Africa] since the start of the pandemic,"" Madhi told Patta. He believes that while many more variants will emerge, the acute phase of the pandemic, with its devastating death tolls, may well be over. ""I'm highly optimistic that we have reached a turning point in this pandemic,"" he said. ""I can't see us revisiting what we experienced during the course of the first three waves in South Africa."" Some high-income countries have voiced caution about relying too much on the South African data, noting differences in the age of the population and the high infection rates there that boosted immunity. And that came with a cost: While Omicron may be to blame for relatively few of them, South Africa lost about 94,000 people to the virus — a significant toll in a country with a population of less than 60 million. Among those urging caution in the U.S., is President Biden's chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci, who said on Monday that it remained ""an open question"" whether Omicron would eventually be looked back upon as the death knell for the pandemic. ""I would hope that that's the case. But that would only be the case if we don't get another variant that eludes the immune response of the prior variant."" Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy stressed on CNN, meanwhile, that many places across the U.S. were still seeing a precipitous rise in cases and hospitalizations, and he said the country ""shouldn't expect a national peak in the next coming days."" But Madhi and other scientists in South Africa still struggle to understand their foreign peers' reluctance to learn from the country's experience — especially given the extensive vaccine rollout in the U.S. and Europe and the firm belief that the vaccines do offer good protection against severe illness and death, and have done so with all the variants to emerge thus far. South Africa is not alone, either. In Britain, too, there are signs that the Omicron wave — which hit just as fast as it did in South Africa — is ebbing, with infections falling sharply in recent days and no precipitous spike in deaths attributed to the Omicron wave. Scientists are optimistic that soon, COVID-19 may be referred to as an endemic disease in Britain, rather than an epidemic. An disease is considered endemic when it remains in circulation within a population, but at relatively low levels of spread and without serious public health implications. In other words, when the country or region in question learns to live with it, like the flu or other colds caused by coronaviruses. Fauci said in his remarks on Monday that even when Omicron infections do finally peak at the national level in the U.S., the coronavirus is unlikely to simply disappear, suggesting a shift from pandemic to endemic. ""We're almost there, it is now the beginning of the end, at least in the U.K.,"" Professor Julian Hiscox, head of infection and global health at the University of Liverpool, who sits on a government health advisory board, told CBS News' partner network BBC News. ""I think life in 2022 will be almost back to before the pandemic."" ""Should a new variant or old variant come along, for most of us, like any other common cold coronavirus, we'll get the sniffles and a bit of a headache and then we're okay,"" Hiscox said. While case numbers, hospitalizations and deaths are still climbing rapidly in many parts of the U.S., they are dropping fast in New York City, one of the first places in the country to be hit hard by Omicron. As the data trajectory in the Big Apple closely resembles that seen in South Africa and Britain, hope is rising that the good news from Johannesburg will prove to be a harbinger of better news, at least, for the United States.

1/19/2022,"Source: MediaNews Group/Reading Eagle via Getty Images / Getty A Milwaukee man is accused of setting up a Burger King robbery with his teenage daughter that led to the death of a 16-year-old worker. According to legal documents, on Jan. 2, Antoine Edwards arrived at the drive-thru of the restaurant in a black four-door Chevy Impala, where Niesha Harris-Brazell was working. When he first pulled up, he spoke to another worker briefly and pulled off. A few minutes later he returned and Harris-Brazell returned and opened the drive-thru window. He then climbed partially through the window in an attempt to commit the robbery. Harris-Brazell was complying. The moment that Edwards pulls off, Harris-Brazell collapses to the floor, but Edwards didn’t shoot her, according to court documents. A co-worker named Derrick Ellis saw the robbery and pulled out a firearm of his own and fired shots that hit Harris-Brazell twice, who was standing in between Edwards and Ellis. Edwards didn’t plan this botched robbery on his own. Court documents say that Edwards planned it with his own 16-year-old daughter who was Harris-Brazell’s best friend. The defendant’s daughter was at Burger King when police first responded to the shooting. At that time she did not divulge that what had happened was the result of botched staged robbery that she had helped plan. After the investigation continued and led to her being suspected, she was re-interviewed and admitted she had lied earlier. She now admitted that the robbery was staged to steal money and she was in on the plan. She said that the victim, NHB, was her best friend. The Impala driver, the defendant, Antoine Edwards, was her father. Edwards’ claimed that Harris-Brazell was also in on the plan and she had sat with her and her father and planned it a few days earlier. In her statement, she said that since Harris-Brazell is usually assigned to the drive-thru window, she would stage the robbery at losing time since she had access to the cash register. Edwards’ daughter also worked at the Burger King in the kitchen and was there at the time of the robbery. Ellis was not aware of this plan. In Edwards’ statement to police, he said his daughter didn’t play a role in the execution of the robbery. He claimed that he called his daughter and she handed the phone to Harris-Brazell and they planned the robbery together. During a court appearance on Jan. 16, Edwards has been charged with felony murder, intentionally contribute/delinquency/death and possession of a firearm by a felon and is being held on $100,000 cash bond due to being considered a flight risk. Even though he didn’t shoot Harris-Brazell, his attempted robbery led to her death, resulting in his felony murder charge. He is also being held on a $5,000 cash bond due to being charged with possession of a firearm by a felon and misdemeanor disorderly conduct, use of a dangerous weapon. Ellis has also been taken into custody. “My baby didn’t deserve that,” her mother Liceal Brazell told WISN 12. “She wasn’t out here in these streets. She went to school. She went to work. She came home.” During a virtual court hearing, Hon. Barry Phillips, Milwaukee County court commissioner said: The allegations in this complaint are serious, sad and unfortunate. Serious because a child lost their life, sad because a grownup was allegedly involved, his child and another child, in a robbery attempt and unfortunate, if the complaint is to be believed, according to the surviving members of this conspiracy, the alleged victim was also involved. A gun was pulled out, allegedly, and another person, who had no idea what was going on, made an attempt to protect himself and his co-workers from possible harm, and in the course of that, a child died. Harris-Brazell’s family is denying that she was involved in the planning of the robbery. Over $40,000 was raised for her funeral through a GoFundMe campaign that is now closed.",U.S./Madame Noire,Milwaukee Man And Daughter’s Botched Robbery Plan Leads To Death Of 16-Year-Old Friend,https://news.yahoo.com/milwaukee-man-daughter-botched-robbery-192212173.html
1/19/2022,"NILAND, Calif. — Deep in the Southern California desert, a massive drill rig taps into what could be the energy of the future. Temperatures in the region can reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit, and residents live under the threat of toxic dust caused by decades of agricultural runoff depositing chemicals into the Salton Sea, a saltwater lake. But in the brine lies lithium, a key ingredient for electric vehicle batteries, and the billion-dollar drilling project promises to not only transform an impoverished region, but also help the United States gain energy independence. “You can bring that brine to the surface"" said Jim Turner, chief operating officer for Controlled Thermal Resources, the company conducting the project. ""You have a lot of energy in the form of heat that you can use to do work.” Geothermal energy production has been around for years, but this effort will double dip by extracting lithium from the brine. Much of the lithium used today comes from Australia and South America and is shipped to Asia, where it's refined and used in batteries, which are mostly made in China. With automakers shifting to electric vehicles, lithium could become the “white gold” of the future, and extracting it in California could reduce or even eliminate U.S. dependency on Chinese production, Turner and other experts say. “It will be the largest lithium production in the U.S., and it may end up being the largest lithium production facility globally,” Turner said. Currently, 10 geothermal plants and two other lithium extraction projects are operating at the Salton Sea, according to the Imperial Irrigation District. The lake formed in 1905 when the Colorado River overflowed and flooded a hot basin, known as the Salton Sink, over a two-year period. In the 1950s, it thrived as a tourist destination, drawing celebrity visitors, including Frank Sinatra. Today, the resorts and marinas are long gone, and desert winds carry toxic dust from agricultural chemicals into the lake, about 150 miles southeast of Los Angeles. Although the project could bring thousands of jobs to the area, which has the highest unemployment rate in the state at 17 percent, some locals want to know more about the plans before wholeheartedly supporting it. “I don’t know much,” said Ruben Hernandez, who owns the Buckshot Deli and Diner near the extraction site. “They say they are going to bring a big plant.” Like many, he said he doesn’t understand the extraction process. But if it brings prosperity to a region where 22 percent of residents live in poverty, he's all for it. “Well, they need more, more jobs,” Hernandez said. “If the revenues come to the town, it will be good for the people” But he also worries the project will create more pollution. “A lot of people are like, especially the kids and old people, getting asthma,” Hernandez said. “You know, asthma, allergies, all that stuff.” Michael McKibben, an associate professor emeritus in geology at the University of California, Riverside, said the process is ""amazingly clean."" “In Australia and China, they’re mainly mining hard rock lithium, so they have to have open pit mines where they blast rock with dynamite, and they have to crush that rock,"" he said. ""This method of producing lithium is really amazingly clean because the brine’s already been brought to the surface. It’s already having the steam taken out of it to run turbines and make electricity.” The Imperial Irrigation District will also collect taxes on the extraction that can be used to invest in the region's water needs.",U.S./NBC News,Lithium in a California lake could help U.S. gain energy autonomy,https://news.yahoo.com/lithium-california-lake-could-help-182832530.html
