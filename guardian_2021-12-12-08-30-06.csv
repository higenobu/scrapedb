12/12/2021,"The Father, Florian Zeller’s disorientating and poignant dementia drama starring Anthony Hopkins, won best actor and best screenplay at this year’s European film awards – but was ultimately pipped to best film by Quo Vadis, Aida?, a shattering depiction of the calamitous 1992 UN attempt to prevent the Srebrenica massacre. Bosnian film-maker Jasmila Žbanić also won best director for the film – a pan-European endeavour involving 12 production companies from nine countries – while Jasna Đuričić won best actress for her performance as the beleaguered UN interpreter trying to save her family from being ethnically cleansed with other Muslims by Bosnian-Serb paramilitaries.  Žbanić dedicated the film’s award to the country’s women and their peacebuilding efforts following the Bosnian war: “Women always have to fix the mess made by men. They taught us how to turn destruction into love.” More cinema and stories from female perspectives would be needed in the future, she warned: “We need more complex stories in order to make our audience ready for very complex times ahead of us.” Hopkins was not present to pick up his best actor award, which follows his Oscar and Bafta for the film. It was accepted remotely by first-time film director Zeller. For the second year in succession, the awards took place as a virtual ceremony streamed live from Berlin – where only the host, German actor Annabelle Mandeng, and a smattering of presenters, award-winners and nominees were present in the studio for this 34th edition. It was a brisk and pragmatic occasion, low on the socio-political fire and state-of-Europe addresses seen in pre-Covid European film awards. But Mandeng did salute the continent’s film-makers for “moving mountains” to make productions happen during the pandemic: “Making films in a time of Covid is an even bigger challenge. Making films in a time when going to the cinema remains subject to restrictions is a big act of faith.” British director Steve McQueen won European innovative storytelling – only the second time the European film academy has given the award – for his five-film anthology about the UK African-Caribbean experience, Small Axe. The prize was presented to him by rapper Tricky and German musician Joy Denalane, who made an impassioned case for its wider relevance. “The films are set in London, yet I saw my own German childhood experience in them,” she said. “Structural racism and unconscious and conscious bias continue in the here and now in so many European countries.” Ninety-year-old Hungarian director Márta Mészáros, whose six-decade career encompasses pioneering gender-focused documentaries and bold New Wave-style features, won a lifetime achievement award for her “original feminist progressivism”. Denmark’s Susanne Bier – who has graduated from 2002’s Open Hearts, part of the minimalist Dogme movement, to 2018’s Netflix hit Bird Box, via serial collaborations with Mads Mikkelsen – was recognised for European achievement in world cinema. Cannes Palme d’Or winner Titane – Julie Ducournau’s divisive, gender-fluid, ultra-violent love fable featuring a woman who is impregnated by a muscle car – was the night’s big loser, going home with a sole award for hair and makeup. Emerald Fennell’s #MeToo revengers’ black comedy Promising Young Woman, a British-American co-production, took the critics’ Fipresci award. The decision to switch to a stripped-back virtual format with a minimal on-site audience was taken on 1 December, with cases rising rapidly across Germany and five days after the WHO announced Omicron as a variant of concern. In a nice demotic touch, film clubs and theatre groups around the continent – from Lisbon to the Finnish Arctic Circle – were asked to present the nominees for many of the awards. Only on one occasion did the dreaded virtual gremlins creep in: when best documentary director Jonas Poher Rasmussen’s sound failed and he was forced convey his thanks in makeshift sign language.

12/12/2021,"Boris Johnson is facing further questions over whether he breached Covid laws after pictures emerged of him hosting a Christmas quiz in Downing Street while London was under tier 2 restrictions. The prime minister was pictured on a screen reading out questions while staff were sat behind computers and conferred on the answers, the Mirror reported.  London was then under restrictions banning any social mixing between households. Official guidance also stated: “You must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity and is not otherwise permitted by the rules in your tier.” Boris Johnson pictured hosting Number 10 Xmas quiz ‘in breach of Covid Laws’https://t.co/wkZh77S0Gv pic.twitter.com/BYg7NJXOk3 A source told the newspaper that in one office there were four teams, each comprising six people. Dozens of staff are understood to have signed up to participate in the quiz online but at 6.30pm that day many decided to take part from No 10 instead. Teams from the prime minister’s private office, the policy unit and press office are understood to have been among those taking part. The quiz took place on 15 December, three days before an alleged Christmas party at Downing Street which is currently being investigated by the cabinet secretary, Simon Case. In response to the latest allegations, a No 10 spokesperson said: “This was a virtual quiz. Downing Street staff were often required to be in the office to work on the pandemic response so those who were in the office for work may have attended virtually from their desks. “The prime minister briefly took part virtually in a quiz to thank staff for their hard work throughout the year.” Case is also investigating an alleged leaving do for an aide, Cleo Watson, on 27 November at No 10 and “thank you” drinks for staff working in the then education secretary Gavin Williamson’s department on 10 December. It comes after the prime minister’s former adviser, Dominic Cummings, claimed on Friday that photos could come to light proving such gatherings were held. On the day that Cummings dramatically left his job in Downing Street in November last year, blaring music and aides chatting were heard in the No 11 residence where Johnson lives with his wife, Carrie, sources have said. Separately, the Guardian was told a “wine and pizza” party attended by Tory advisers was held in Downing Street after a Covid press conference during the first lockdown, in spring 2020. No 10 said the prime minister was in his flat “solely with his family” on the evening in question and the spokesperson denied knowledge of any gathering.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson pictured hosting No 10 Christmas quiz last year,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/11/boris-johnson-pictured-hosting-no-10-christmas-quiz-last-year
12/12/2021,"Jonny Gray pulled Exeter out of their stupor and put his shoulder to the wheel with a hat-trick to subdue an understrength Montpellier and get his team off to an encouraging start in Europe. The Scottish second-row scored twice in 11 second-half minutes and added his third on the hour as he showed no ill-effects of the shoulder surgery that has curtailed his start to the season.  His hat-trick try secured the bonus point for Chiefs and spark accusations of goal-hanging in the Exeter dressing room while Sam Simmonds and Don Armand applied some late garnish as the hosts won running away. Gray was playing just his second game of the season since his lay off after going under the knife following the Premiership final and, tries aside, he shrugged off the inactivity. “I don’t know if Jonny has scored three tries in the rest of his career,” said the head coach, Ali Hepher. “He put himself in the right place and was smart when he picked up. All round we are really pleased with Jonny and we have got to keep him rolling. “He understands the game. He has had a bad injury and been out a long time. He does not need too long to get up and running because he thinks ahead of the game.” The hosts did not have it all their own way. Some of the Chiefs’ play in the first half was as lacking in spark as the floodlight at one corner of the end they were attacking which was missing a few bulbs and left one area of the pitch in the murk. Their scrum struggled against the rejuvenated former Bath and England tighthead Henry Thomas and the loosehead Enzo Forletta, and their discipline at the breakdown left something to be desired. Hepher added: “The first half was a little bit disappointing, we were watching the game a little bit instead of getting immersed in the fight. The guys got together and fought their way through it to get a convincing win.” Chiefs were given a shot in the arm when Montpellier picked a mostly second string side. Last year’s Challenge Cup winners did not have Handré Pollard, the South African World Cup winning fly-half, who is moving to Leicester next season in the 23. Paolo Garbisi, the Italian 10, was not on duty either and it was left to the teenage fly-half Louis Foursans-Bourdette to open the scoring with a 40 metre penalty. He made it 6-0 after 10 minutes when Exeter were penalised at the breakdown for the second time and still Chiefs could not get in the French 22. Finally, after 23 minutes, Exeter found their stride. Their forwards carried hard for multiple phases before fly-half Joe Simmonds’ long pass found full-back Stuart Hogg who darted back against the grain of the defence to score and give the hosts a 7-6 lead at the break. A minute into the second half Gray finished off a move marked by more of the same relentless driving and he was at it again in the 52nd minute to make it 21-6 after Simmonds’ conversion. Then his third made the game safe at 28-6 with the wing Josua Vici sent to the sin-bin as Gray scored and Exeter took control.",Sport/Sport,Jonny Gray hat-trick inspires Exeter to easy win over Montpellier,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/11/exeter-montpellier-european-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report
