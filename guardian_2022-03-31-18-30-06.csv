3/31/2022,"Measures to ensure the safety of LGBTQ+ people in Qatar remain inadequate with less than eight months to go to the World Cup, groups supporting the community have said. Same-sex relationships are directly criminalised under the laws of the Gulf state, leading to concerns over the wellbeing of LGBTQ+ people visiting the country for the tournament and those from that community who reside there. An international grouping of 16 organisations focused on LGBTIQ+ rights has issued eight action points to the tournament organisers Fifa and the local organising committee. These include repealing laws that target LGBTIQ+ people, providing explicit safety guarantees to members of the community, guaranteed right of entry to Qatar, the communication of a clear welcome and of the right to free expression and ensuring there is no censorship or ban on the discussion of LGBTIQ+ issues. The group said in a letter sent to the PA news agency that Fifa had responded in writing but that Qatar’s Supreme Committee, in charge of World Cup delivery, had not yet. “Progress has been slow, reassurances about the safety of LGBTIQ+ people and the mechanisms in place to ensure safety have not been adequate,” the letter stated. “If acknowledgement of the issues facing LGBTIQ+ people in Qatar and reassurances of safety cannot be offered, we will be forced to question if the risk facing LGBTIQ+ people wanting to attend or work at the World Cup in Qatar is too high. “Further meetings are planned with both Fifa and the Supreme Committee in the coming weeks where it is hoped progress can be made.” The letter added that a failure to act in the run-up to the tournament could be viewed as an endorsement of the laws as they stand and make life for LGBTIQ+ visitors and residents even tougher in the future. The groups who co-signed the letter included Athlete Ally, Discover Football, the European Gay and Lesbian Sports Association, the Fare network, the Federation of Gay Games, Football v Homophobia, Hidayah, the International Supporters Council, ILGA World, ILGA Asia, Leap Sports, Pride House International, Mantiqitna, Mosaic, Queer Khaleeji and You Can Play. Nassar al-Khater, the Qatar World Cup chief executive, has previously said: “I would like to assure any fan, of any gender, [sexual] orientation, religion, race to rest assured that Qatar is one of the most safe countries in the world — and they’ll all be welcome here.” He talked then about “a lot of training going into security personnel” and said: “Public displays of affection is frowned upon, it’s not part of our culture – but that goes across the board to everybody.”",Sport/Football,Concerns raised over possible risk for LGBTQ+ people at Qatar World Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/31/concerns-raised-over-possible-risk-for-lgbtq-people-at-qatar-world-cup
3/31/2022,"The streaming wars have come for professional football. Amazon spent the better part of 12 months backing up the Brinks trucks to try to lure anyone and everyone away from the traditional NFL broadcasters to prop up its new Thursday Night Football vehicle – ultimately landing Al Michaels and Kirk Herbstreit for a reported $24m per year combined. And while Amazon was expected to be the great disruptor in the broadcasting arms race, it’s at one of the traditional networks that the merry-go-round has had its most transformative effect. ESPN pinched Joe Buck and Troy Aikman from Fox, handing over a Friday night college football game for the rights to pay the duo in excess of $100m over five years to rejuvenate its flagging Monday Night Football [shudders] brand. ESPN’s marquee property has been paddling upstream ever since a pre-scandal Jon Gruden skedaddled back to coaching in 2018. There was the Jason Witten debacle; the BoogerMobile; leaps from one ill-fated booth to the next. The network’s bid to replicate the success of Tony Romo over on CBS was a flop: take a just-retired Cowboys player (in this case Witten) with little to no professional broadcasting experience and start the tape rolling. In Witten’s case, it was a mess. Those Witten days were the nadir, dragging the league’s once-formidable booth to the bottom of the pack. The most recent installment of Monday Night Football was fine: a smorgasbord of banalities piloted by the ever-shouty Steve Levy, offset by the savvy analysis of Louis Riddick and Brian Griese – a combination who were good individually but struggled as a collective. But the broadcast’s biggest problem was its own sister show: The Manningcast. While the main broadcast dwarfed the viewing figures of the Manningcast, the show led by the Manning brothers dominated the discourse surrounding Monday nights, with the NFL media ecosystem leaping into hyperdrive at the drop of a Peyton word or the flick of Eli’s finger. The NFL’s official YouTube channel put together a carefully choreographed half-hour package every Tuesday morning for those who missed it in real-time – racking up views in the millions. No such entry was ever made for the more conventional stylings of Levy, Griese, and Riddick. Grabbing Fox’s ‘A’ crew is a bid from the executives at ESPN to microwave some credibility for the main booth – dragging it, with the writing of two very large checks, from the bottom rung of national productions up into the top-tier, one that will comfortably stand against Mike Tirico and Cris Collinsworth over at NBC and Amazon’s new Michaels-enforced property. Buck and Aikman leaving Fox clears the way for Kevin Burkhardt and Greg Olsen to assume the top seats at their network, which may turn out to be an upgrade. ESPN’s goal was different. They couldn’t take another swing on maybe-possibly talent, luring away a freshly retired player or sinking money into up-and-comers from another network – or dipping back into their college ranks. They wanted a sure thing. “When you have the opportunity to bring in the iconic, longest-running NFL broadcasting duo, you take it,” Jimmy Pitaro, the chairman of ESPN and sports content, said in a statement. “Especially at a time when we are on the cusp of a new era in our expanding relationship with the NFL.” It’s the last portion of Pitaro’s statement that’s the most important. It solidifies where ESPN sees its future: Stephen A Smith and live games. To secure live game rights, you have to have a strong working relationship with the rights holder – in this instance, the NFL. It should not go unstated that less than 14 months after ESPN laid off 300 people, and asked others to take pay cuts, it found $33m a year to pay a pair of announcers to call 18 games a season. But live games are the central part of every sports broadcaster these days. Rights holders across sports continue to inch ever closer toward Pravda-style programming, looking at all times to preserve relationships in an era where athletes, leagues and teams can take to their own podcasts or social media feeds to tell their stories. When walking into negotiations with the NFL, Pitaro knew his flagship production was not cutting it to the league’s standard. The “expanded relationship” Pitaro was noting was a nod to Disney – ESPN’s parent company – securing a further three Monday Night Football double-headers beginning next season. Disney also owns ABC, which will become a broadcaster of the Super Bowl from 2027. It doesn’t take an expert to read between the lines of the discussions between rights holder and broadcaster. You best get on the level of NBC and Fox by the time 2027 rolls around. Buck and Aikman will bring competency back to Monday Night Football. There won’t be fireworks; there will be no innovation. But Disney and ESPN executives will never have to worry again about the broadcasting nudging up against the edges of an embarrassment – or field worrisome phone calls from the league’s big wigs. How do you put a price on that? Talking on the South Beach Session podcast, John Skipper, the former head of ESPN, said that internal data at the company showed who was calling the game made little difference to audience figures. “I never saw a scintilla of evidence that the people in the booth changed the ratings even by a smidgen,” Skipper said. “The race to hire people is mostly about internal pride.” Adding Buck and Aikman will not shift the network’s most important metrics: viewers and ad dollars. But the pair bring a certain feel to a big-game broadcast; Buck has risen from the son of a broadcasting legend to elder statesman calling World Series games, the Fox game of the week, and Super Bowls – whatever your opinion on his style, his voice conveys the message that this game matters. Aikman, meanwhile, won three Super Bowls with the NFL’s most famous team before beginning his long partnership with Buck. ESPN’s venture has long felt amateurish compared to those of NBC and Fox. By swiping Fox’s crew, they will no longer have to wait to see if the booth gels – to take a punt on a McFarland or Witten; or to continue to try to coax Peyton Manning to step into the main booth. Adding proven commodities – while lowering the ceiling of what a broadcast could be – is about removing any possible headaches; Disney is paying a premium to never have to worry about the broadcast – what viewers think of it, what tastemakers think, what the advertisers think. Most importantly: What the NFL thinks.

Here is one from reader Miles Smith: The Moth is an amazing storytelling radio show/podcast – you never know what you’re going to get in each short episode, whether it’s a cringe-inducing memory of a childhood crush, a candid coming out story, or a devastating story about a young man in a coma. It’s truly special and the archive is huge. This week, journalist and host of The Last Bohemians Kate Hutchinson chooses five of the best podcasts about women, from a show about medical mysteries to a stereotype-busting series on South Asian women Black Girl SongbookJournalist Danyel Smith returns this month with the third season of her podcast on black womens’ huge contribution to popular music. Combining music and chat, Smith has the tunes on hand to show listeners what exactly makes Brandy’s voice so special, to explain the complicated history of blue-eyed soul via Teena Marie and Adele, and to deliver a properly in-depth analysis of Rihanna as we all wait, and wait, and wait for her next album. Season three celebrates Aretha Franklin on what would have been her 80th birthday, as well as disco queen Donna Summer, the era-defining soundtrack for Waiting To Exhale, and soul legend Deniece Williams. BodiesAllison Behringer’s groundbreaking series bills itself as a “feminist documentary podcast” and, has, since 2018, followed women and gender non-conforming people as they unravel the onion of their varying medical mysteries. Many of the ailments featured are ones you only hear whispered about by the work loos, from the menopause and fibroids to babies that won’t eat. Others are less talked about still (think painful sex and uncontrollable orgasms). It’s a masterstroke in sensitive storytelling, and of spotlighting medical ignorance, and has also broadened out into shocking wider stories – such as a recent episode about a school built on oozing, contaminated land. Literary FrictionNow that Call Your Girlfriend has come to a close and The High Low is long gone, there’s a gaping hole for a British chatty women-on-culture podcast. Enter friends Carrie Plitt and writer Octavia Bright, whose longrunning literary pod – also a monthly show on NTS Radio, straight outta Dalston, east London – may just be your new favourite. Their guestlist is a who’s who of must-read authors, including Maggie Nelson, Raven Leilani, Deborah Levy, Carmen Maria Machado and, yes, Sally Rooney (twice). But their warm patter and the fascinating twists and turns of their conversations elevate it beyond being merely an insidery book club. Call Me MotherIn this podcast – told largely in dreamy, largely first-person format – queer elders tell Shon Faye, author of The Transgender Issue, about being trailblazers and their journeys in gender, with little interjection. The curation here is excellent; while it doesn’t exclusively feature women and non-binary speakers, there are key episodes with people like Kate Bornstein, a septugenarian transgender activist, theorist and performance artist who talks about their “gender quandary”, from the pre-Stonewall days, through joining Scientology and the cocaine 80s. Their touching interview is a testament to the thrilling, knotty joy of life.

3/31/2022,"The Queensland government has fined coal seam gas company Arrow Energy $1m for breaches of land access rules over four years, after an investigation into allegations the company drilled diagonally beneath farmland without notifying the landholders. The fine is among the most significant non-compliance penalties ever issued to a resources company in Queensland. Groups that have raised concerns against the rapid spread of the coal seam gas wells in Queensland’s farming communities say the penalty is a “small start”, but that landholders’ rights to object to gas drilling must now be strengthened. The investigation began last year after farmers in the Darling Downs discovered Arrow Energy – a joint venture between global giants Shell and PetroChina – had drilled “deviated” wells from neighbouring properties and underneath their land. State authorities have spent more than 10 months assessing allegations that such activity was done in breach of land access rules, which required formal entry notices and for landholders to be notified. Queensland law classifies directional drilling as a “preliminary activity”, generally allowing companies to drill under private land without a prior agreement in place but regulations require them to notify the landholder before starting. Relationships between farmers and the gas industry in the area have become fraught, to the extent the GasFields Commission Queensland issued a statement calling on the state government to take “immediate action” to conclude its investigation and resolve “coexistence” issues. In a statement, the Queensland resources minister, Scott Stewart, said the $1m fine was for breaches of the land access framework by Arrow between 2018 and 2022. “The significance of this penalty takes into account Arrow’s indiscretions,” Stewart said in a statement. “As a government, we make no apologies for holding businesses to account if they do the wrong thing. “Queensland’s resources framework promotes the coexistence of landholders, regional communities, and industry, however coexistence is a fragile concept, and it needs to be nurtured by all parties to be truly sustainable. “Arrow Energy has acknowledged it has made mistakes in the past and in more recent times the company has taken tangible steps towards fostering genuine coexistence with landholders impacted by their operations. “A line will now be drawn under this historical behaviour for industry and the focus from now on is ensuring that this doesn’t happen again.” Stewart said the GasFields Commission is also investigating the issue of coal seam gas-induced subsidence, its potential impact on farming operations and the adequacy of the existing regulatory framework. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Guardian Australia has reported on concerns that Queensland law ascribes no environmental value to farmland, and that landholders have little recourse in the event coal seam gas drilling causes subsidence on their properties. Lock the Gate, a group of conservationists and farmers opposed to gas extraction, said the fine was unlikely to act as a deterrent, noting the wealth of Arrow’s parent companies. Shell posted a profit of more than $19bn this year. The group said the fine was a “small step” but that more needed to be done to hold the industry to account. “This is ultimately just a slap on the wrist for a massive multinational company like Shell/PetroChina,” said Lock the Gate’s Queensland spokesperson, Ellie Smith.

Farmers want an unequivocal right to say no to mining on or under their land and Queenslanders want the farms that produce their food and fibre protected and prioritised over short-term, damaging gas.” In a statement, Arrow Energy said it accepted the decision and penalty. “We recognise we made mistakes in the earlier implementation of the deviated wells model,” the statement said. “We have acknowledged this publicly and made substantial improvements to our operations. “We remain deeply committed to continually improving the way we engage with all landholders.”",News/Australia news,Coal seam gas company Arrow Energy fined $1m for breaching Queensland’s land access rules,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/31/coal-seam-gas-company-arrow-energy-fined-1m-for-breaching-queenslands-land-access-rules
3/31/2022,"Anthony Albanese has pledged to spend an extra $2.5bn fixing the problems in aged care if Labor is elected – as the major parties accelerate towards a campaign contest to be called within days. The federal opposition leader used his budget reply speech on Thursday night – a set-piece that followed a historic address to the Australian parliament by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy – to outbid the Morrison government on the policy response to the royal commission into aged care quality and safety. Albanese told parliament if Labor wins the May election, his new government would fund a wage increase for aged care workers and require residential aged care facilities to have a registered nurse on site 24 hours a day, seven days a week. He said a Labor government would support the outcome of the landmark work value case before the Fair Work Commission and fund the outcome of the pay deliberation. Unions are seeking pay rises of 25% for more than 200,000 aged care workers. The starting rate for a personal carer is currently $21.96 an hour – just $2 higher than the national minimum wage. Albanese said if Australians wanted higher standards in aged care “we need to support higher wages for our carers”. The $2.5bn policy costing – over four years – unveiled by Labor on Thursday night does not include earmarked expenditure for an as-yet-undetermined pay increase that would be delivered to providers in the form of increased subsidies. As well as backing a pay rise for the aged care workforce, Albanese said Labor would work to raise the standard of care by implementing the recommendation of the aged care royal commission requiring that elderly people receive a minimum of 215 minutes of care a day. He said he would work with the aged care sector to develop and implement mandatory nutrition standards to ensure every resident gets decent food. Labor would also give enhanced power to the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner to require facilities to provide detailed reports of their expenditure. Albanese said on Thursday night Australians had been “chilled by stories of unforgivable neglect – maggots in wounds, people going days without fresh air, a shower, or a change of clothes, stories of residents lying on the floor, crying out in pain, and nobody is there to help them”. “It goes against everything we are as Australians,” he said. “And while our loved ones suffer, and their carers, mostly women, are underpaid and overworked [and] some of the operators running these places are doing very well.” The Labor leader declared the Liberals “had a decade to do something about aged care” but the Morrison government’s response to the royal commission did not go far enough. Last year, the Morrison government unveiled a $17.7bn package to reform the scandal-plagued aged care system. The reforms aimed to clear the home care waiting list within two years and boost the aged care workforce. But advocates have argued $10bn a year is needed to bring the sector up to scratch, and unions and providers expressed disappointment after Tuesday night’s budget that the Coalition did not earmark funds for a pay increase for workers. The Coalition has offered aged care workers pre-election bonus payments worth up to $800. Albanese said if Morrison won the election, “nothing will change – and the bleak present they have created will be the bleak future awaiting so many more Australians”. He said the Morrison government’s budget was not a plan for the country but a “bunch of last-minute, one-off handouts for problems that have been a decade in the making” and a collection of promises with “a use-by date – conveniently after the election”. Albanese said the prime minister had handed down a budget for the next six weeks, “when we need a plan for the next six years”. He said Tuesday night’s budget exemplified “a wasted decade” and predicted voters would see the pre-election economic statement “for what it is”. Referencing language used by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, when he accused the prime minister of lying to him over the cancellation of a $90bn submarine contract, Albanese added: “Actually, I don’t think, I know.” Albanese said the coming election contest was not about the future of the Coalition it was about the future of the country. “I went into politics because I believe good government can change the lives of Australians for the better,” he said. “Reaching out to those who’ve fallen back, and creating opportunities that make it possible to get ahead, to be the best we can be.” He said he wanted to lead a country that gave its citizens “the chance to follow their dreams, to study what they want, to learn the trade or get the job they want, to buy a home, to start a family”. “An Australia of boundless opportunity,” he said. “An inclusive Australia that celebrates our rich diversity and values our multiculturalism as an asset. An Australia that embraces the generous Uluru Statement from the Heart, including a constitutionally recognised Indigenous voice to parliament.” He said if voters gave him the honour of the prime ministership, he would “act with integrity, lead with responsibility – and treat you with respect”.",News/Australia news,Budget reply speech: Anthony Albanese pledges $2.5bn extra for struggling aged care system,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/31/budget-reply-speech-anthony-albanese-pledges-25bn-extra-for-struggling-aged-care-system
3/31/2022,"Laetitia Ky makes sculptures out of hair, although I’m not sure the word “sculpture” accurately conveys just how dynamic her art is. Her pieces are moments, scenes, statements, emotions, rendered in black afro textured hair. Ky is central to the art. Her sculptures can’t be displayed on a wall or a table. They can’t be bought or taken on tour. Every piece is on her head, extending high up into the space above and around her, a growth of coils and curls that she twists into shapes that seem unfathomable. There are no gimmicks, technological cheats or shortcuts. Ivory Coast-born Ky, 25, doesn’t even create the sculpture on a flat surface or stand and then attach them to her head. She links hair extensions directly to her own natural fro and then, using a mirror, proceeds to mould both into shapes. If what she wants to build is particularly complicated, she uses wires and glue. This is even more remarkable considering the fact that her pieces range from the bucolic, to the domestic and the political. There are sculptures of household chores, where Ky’s hair extends into a vacuum cleaner she then grips to clean with; others where Ky is the body of an alligator, crawling out of a swamp, her hair the alligator’s head. There are more shocking ones, where Ky’s hair is a womb – on each side, instead of ovaries, there are two middle fingers – or a vagina with period blood pouring from it. On a video call from her home town of Abidjn, Ky speaks slowly and deliberately, trying to pick the right word in English. Her hair falls long around her shoulders in twists. She describes in her book Love and Justice: A Journey of Empowerment, Activism and Embracing Black Beauty the long path she took to embrace her natural look. Finally accepting her hair was the start of her accepting many other things she had grown up to believe she had to change – her skin colour, her weight, her politics. “Appreciating my hair let me appreciate other things that made me black,” she says. “Like my skin. I’m very dark-skinned and the beautiful Ivorian woman is supposed to be light-skinned. When I started to love my hair, I started to love my skin, and I started to love the fact that I was black. And when I started to love the fact that I was black, it helped me to love the fact that I was a woman. Loving one thing led me to love another thing.” Through her art and activism – she studied business administration at university – Ky has found international acclaim, with almost half a million followers on Instagram and a social media contract with Elite Models under her partnership with TikTok. She has also moved into acting, appearing in Philippe Lacôte’s Night of the Kings, with another film role in the works. But Ky didn’t always have the body confidence that has empowered her work. She started school much earlier than her peers. “I was three years younger than the [next] youngest person. When you’re young, you try to adapt to be at the level of others. It was hard when your school friends already had their periods and you were just a child.” They had “all the curves”, she says, while she was “just a slender child”. She was also a lot darker than her peers. “A lot of them were bleached. So not only am I dark-skinned and the standard is to be light-skinned. But also I am skinny, so I have nothing. I think maybe I was nine when my body image really started to go down.” She began to binge eat and gained weight, too much as far as a certain boy she had a crush on was concerned. One day in class, he told her that she had a fat stomach. The class laughed. She was humiliated. It was “like a scene from a movie”, she says, and it sent her spiralling in the other direction. “I’m very extreme in everything I feel, everything I want. This was a shock. It shifted my mind in a couple of seconds.” Anorexia came at 13, then bulimia. “I was just stuck,” she says, unable to find a way out of her illness. It was easy for her to hide it, even though her mother noticed she was losing weight. “I would always wear baggy clothes so she would not see the real deal. All my life revolved around food. I was scared of it. If there was a social thing, I was thinking: ‘Oh my God, I will have to eat something so that people don’t find me weird.’” Then she would start to plan: “Will I be able to go to the bathroom? Will I be able to throw up without people knowing? It was crazy.” Her mother caught her changing one day, and saw Ky’s emaciated body. Her distress was what Ky needed to find a way out, to spare her mother more pain. This description is such a far cry from the Ky in her sculptures, and the one sitting in front of me, easy in her own skin. I ask her how she changed from the teen who hated her body. “It definitely didn’t happen overnight,” she says. But where it really started, was with her hair. “I always had relaxed hair. I think I first used hair relaxer when I was five.” Then she saw a picture of Beyoncé with box braids and immediately went to get the same. “It was tight, I had never felt so much pain in my head. But I was loving it. It was pretty. And the rule here is if it’s not painful, then the hairstyle is not OK.” The tension, combined with the fragility of her hair, already damaged by relaxers, meant that she began to lose hair at her hairline. “It was terrifying, all the front of my hair was gone. I needed to hide it, so I did a weave, with some bangs; when I took the wig out, it was even worse.” She started searching online for a solution and discovered the natural hair community in America. “I was just shocked. I was 16 and it was the first time I was seeing black women with their natural hair. Can you imagine living in a country full of black women, and I’ve never seen this before? I was amazed.” She cut off all her hair and told herself: “I will try to come to natural and see what will happen.” That decision unlocked something else. “This is where everything started.” While her hair grew she started following social media accounts promoting the black aesthetic, including one on Facebook that posted about African culture before colonisation. “One day,” she says, the account featured a photo album of “African women prior to colonisation. Their hair was just [she gestures upwards from her head] ooop! It was also sculpture, decorated with beads. The shape they were able to give to their hair … I was very curious. How did they do this? I felt like I needed to experience myself how to create some shape too.” She teased her hair with extensions into a high column and posted it online. It got more attention than she expected, so she made some more shapes and posted again. “I was trying to push a little bit further every time I was posting, and the attention got bigger and bigger all the time.” When Ky first started posting on social media, she tells me she began receiving messages from women thanking her for her work and saying it was the first time they had seen a black woman so proud that she had turned herself into art. “I started to realise that maybe what I was doing was more powerful than I thought it was,” Ky says. “If I really try to use it to share what is important for me, it can make a difference.” Initially her pieces were about gender equality rather than race, “because growing up in Ivory Coast, this did not seem as much of an issue.” She began to explore racial issues after there was international interest in this element of her art. Her ability to question sexual taboos was seeded by her family, thanks to her unusually liberal parents. They separated when Ky was young but both tried to ensure that Ky felt comfortable with her body and sexuality, despite Ky’s mother being from a very strict family. “On my first day of college,” she says, “my dad took a box of condoms and gave it to me, saying: ‘It will happen there. Make sure you protect yourself.’ It was so awkward. I wanted to hide. My parents never tried to make sex a taboo for me and my sister.” The response to her work has been unexpected, both at home and abroad. In Ivory Coast, she was surprised to discover that “some women share the same beliefs but weren’t bold enough to tell it out loud”. Others, she says, predictably “freaked out” when she talked or made art about abortion, for example, telling her: “I love what you create but I don’t like what you say.” But what really took Ky by surprise was how her work got caught up in the slipstream of a western discourse about gender identification. Her focus on the punishment of biological womanhood has attracted comments that she is excluding trans women from her feminism. Ky is upfront about how the context is unfamiliar to her. “I’m not gonna lie, I don’t fully understand it. But in Ivory Coast we have things like excision, we have things like breast flattening. So when I come out there trying to express all this and someone tells me sex doesn’t exist, only gender exists, I’m like: ‘What are you saying? Sorry, but no.’” She explains that her anger on this issue is about her work being critiqued by what she believes is a self-centred western issue. She also hears from western women who thank her for saying women have wombs. “Every time I talk about sex as a reason of oppression of African women, some western people get mad. And I’m always like: ‘I’m sorry, maybe your experience is different but I’m not going to shut myself up to make you feel better about your convictions. Because those things are really happening where I come from. I also understand they have an experience I don’t have, so maybe what they think is OK concerning their experience. I’m talking about me. If it was different for you, that’s cool. I think inclusivity is a very good thing. I’m a black woman.” Ky seems broadly unshaken by any criticism, either at home or abroad. “I have learned to be very strong. I surround myself with people who agree with me.” She bats away social censure constantly about her life choices, from not shaving her armpits to not wanting children or marriage, in a society where these things are non-negotiable milestones for women. “I’ve never felt the need to have children or to be married,” she says, breezily. “Maybe it’s because I’ve never been around a successful marriage in my life. Of course I am interested in finding love. I want to find someone I will grow and build things with. I don’t think we necessarily need to be married.” At such a young age, Ky speaks as if her work is done. Her focus now is on others. “I want to inspire other women to speak,” she says. “When you start to believe you’re valuable, that you’re worth something, you don’t accept injustice any more. You want respect. You want to be free.” Love and Justice: A Journey of Empowerment, Activism, and Embracing Black Beauty by Laetitia Ky (Princeton Architectural Press, £19.99) is published 5 April",Arts/Art and design,"‘Some people are freaked out’: how Laetitia Ky tackles abortion, sexism and race with her extraordinary hair",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/31/some-people-are-freaked-out-how-laetitia-ky-tackles-abortion-sexism-and-race-with-her-extraordinary-hair
