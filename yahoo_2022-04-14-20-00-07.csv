4/14/2022,"Gov. Ron DeSantis is expected to soon sign legislation that will open a new front in how employers will need to think about workplace activities and set new state guidelines for what would constitute “unlawful employment practices.” House Bill 7, titled “Individual Freedom,” was one of the most contentious pieces of legislation considered by lawmakers during the legislative session that ended in mid-March. While much of the attention focused on the restrictions that would be applied to the classroom, the bill could also alter Florida businesses’ labor practices — in particular restricting how employers present programs aimed at promoting diversity, equity and inclusion at work. Ellen M. Leibovitch, an employment lawyer based in Boca Raton, says employers who offer training to employees on discrimination and harassment should be prepared to tailor the curriculum and presentation of their training programs. “I think that employers are maybe not going to be doing these trainings anymore, or they’re going to do these trainings so neutral as to really not have the intended impact that they are supposed to have,” Leibovitch said. The push comes as DeSantis and Florida Republicans take aim at “corporate wokeness” and publicly clash with The Walt Disney Company over the company’s opposition to a bill banning the teaching of gender-related issues to kids younger than third grade — and potentially higher grades. In practice, the bill would amend the Florida Civil Rights Act and make it unlawful for employers to subject workers to “training, instruction, or any other required activity” that promotes or compels them to believe the following concepts: That virtues such as merit, excellence, hard work, fairness, neutrality, objectivity, and racial colorblindness are racist or sexist, or were created by members of a particular race, color, sex, or national origin to oppress members of another race, color, sex or national origin. That members of one race, color sex, or national origin are morally superior to members of another race, color, sex or national origin. That an individual’s moral character or status as either privileged or oppressed is necessarily determined by his or her race, color, sex, or national origin. That an individual, by virtue of their race, color, sex, or national origin, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously. That members of one race, color, sex, or national origin cannot and should not attempt to treat others without respect to race, color, sex, or national origin. That a member of one race, color, sex or national origin cannot and should not attempt to treat others without respect to race, color, sex or national origin. That an individual, by virtue of their race, color, sex, or national origin, bears responsibility for and must feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress because of actions committed in the past by other members of the same race, color, sex, or national origin. That an individual, by virtue of his or her race, color, sex, or national origin, should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment to achieve diversity, equity, or inclusion. If an employee believes their employer has violated any of those principles when delivering a training program, they can sue and pursue a claim for relief, including damages and attorneys’ fees. The potential of lawsuits as an enforcement mechanism are likely to have a chilling effect on how employers convey certain diversity and inclusion goals in training sessions, according to some labor lawyers and consultants in the human resources field. Supporters say the bill is meant to protect workers from being told they should feel bad about historical wrongs committed by people of their same race, gender or national origin. The bill sponsor, Rep. Bryan Avila, R-Miami Springs, acknowledged part of the intent is to eliminate workplace programs that promote the concept of “white privilege” and broadly singled out training programs promoted by Walt Disney Co., Coca-Cola, American Express and Google, that he said would be in violation of the bill. “Whether it is training on how to be less oppressive, or less white, all those things should not be occurring,” Avila said in a committee hearing in February. “All of those things are counterproductive to where we want to be as a nation, state, as a community.” Penny Morey, a human resources executive and consultant with more than 30 years of experience in the field, said she has never encountered a training session curriculum that espouses the concepts the bill seeks to ban. The problem, she argued, is that the bill could trigger lawsuits based on how someone perceives the delivery of a training program. “This law is trying to fix a problem that doesn’t exist,” she said. “But please know that when I say bogus lawsuits exist, they do. People can find an attorney that works on contingency now and then, who will take something like this because it may make them some money on a contingency basis. They may get some publicly, they may get some attention — and that is going to be the chilling effect.” Morey said she believes most companies and employers will likely “wait and see” how the bill is rolled out and what the reaction is among employees. “I think the danger is that a lot of employers — and I don’t particularly blame them — will say ‘let’s step back away and take that out for now and let’s tackle it later when we know better about how this is going to be enforced,’ ” she said. Another issue is that part of the reason why employers have training programs in the first place is to insulate themselves from liability, Leibovitch said. Training sessions can offer employers a layer of protection to say they tried to prevent wrongdoing in the workplace if an employee acts inappropriately. The company can still be liable, but those programs can show they tried to tell employers not to act in a certain way. “If you don’t do the training then you really have no defense that you were trying to prevent,” said Sen. Tina Polsky, D-Boca Raton, a labor and employment attorney. If an employer goes through with a training program that could put them at risk of a lawsuit, they will also need to take into consideration their insurance policies. “The insurance that employers buy may not cover this yet because it is so new. So if they are sued, it could be that their insurance company who covers them for employment liability may say, ‘look this isn’t on your policy, so you’re on your own,’ ” Morey said.",U.S./Miami Herald,Here’s what Florida employers need to know if DeSantis approves new ‘anti-woke’ law,https://news.yahoo.com/florida-employers-know-desantis-approves-100000337.html
4/14/2022,"By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON (Reuters) - One of Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest allies warned NATO on Thursday that if Sweden and Finland joined the U.S.-led military alliance then Russia would have to bolster its defences in the region, including by deploying nuclear weapons. Finland, which shares a 1,300-km (810-mile) border with Russia, and Sweden are considering joining the NATO alliance. Finland will make a decision in the next few weeks, Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on Wednesday. Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, said that should Sweden and Finland join NATO then Russia would have to strengthen its land, naval and air forces in the Baltic Sea. Medvedev also explicitly raised the nuclear threat by saying that there could be no more talk of a ""nuclear free"" Baltic - where Russia has its Kaliningrad exclave sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. ""There can be no more talk of any nuclear–free status for the Baltic - the balance must be restored,"" said Medvedev, who was president from 2008 to 2012. ""Until today, Russia has not taken such measures and was not going to,"" Medvedev said. ""If our hand is forced well... take note it wasn't us who proposed this,"" he added. Lithuania said Russia's threats were nothing new and that Moscow had deployed nuclear weapons to Kaliningrad long before the war in Ukraine. The possible accession of Finland and Sweden into NATO - founded in 1949 to provide collective Western security against the Soviet Union - would be one of the biggest European strategic consequences of the war in Ukraine. Finland gained independence from Russia in 1917 and fought two wars against it during World War Two during which it lost some territory to Moscow. On Thursday, Finland announced a military exercise in Western Finland with the participation of forces from Britain, the United States, Latvia and Estonia. Sweden has not fought a war for 200 years and post-war foreign policy has focused on supporting democracy internationally, multilateral dialogue and nuclear disarmament. KALININGRAD Kaliningrad is of particular importance in the northern European theatre. Formerly the Prussian port of Koenigsberg, capital of East Prussia, it lies less than 1400 km from London and Paris and 500 km from Berlin. Russia said in 2018 it had deployed Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad, which was captured by the Red Army in April 1945 and ceded to the Soviet Union at the Potsdam conference. The Iskander, known as SS-26 Stone by NATO, is a short-range tactical ballistic missile system that can carry both conventional and nuclear warheads. Its official range is 500 km but some Western military sources suspect its range may be much greater. ""No sane person wants higher prices and higher taxes, increased tensions along borders, Iskanders, hypersonics and ships with nuclear weapons literally at arm's length from their own home,"" Medvedev said. ""Let's hope that the common sense of our northern neighbors will win,"" said Medvedev. Lithuanian Defence Minister Arvydas Anusauskas said Russia had deployed nuclear weapons to Kaliningrad even before the war. ""Nuclear weapons have always been kept in Kaliningrad ... the international community, the countries in the region, are perfectly aware of this,"" Anusauskas was quoted as saying by BNS. ""They use it as a threat."" Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands of people, displaced millions and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States - by far the world's two biggest nuclear powers. Putin says the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia and Moscow had to defend against the persecution of Russian-speaking people by Ukraine. Ukraine says it is fighting against an imperial-style land grab and that Putin's claims of genocide are nonsense. U.S. President Joe Biden says Putin is a war criminal and a dictator. Putin says the conflict in Ukraine as part of a much broader confrontation with the United States which he says is trying to enforce its hegemony even as its dominance over the international order declines.

4/14/2022,"Former President Donald Trump skipped another opportunity to call Russian President Vladimir Putin’s actions evil on Wednesday, then boasted about how well he knew the dictator. “I knew Putin very well. Almost as well as I know you, Sean,” Trump told his close confidante, Fox News host Sean Hannity, as the network aired graphic images of dead bodies and the damage left by Russian troops in Ukraine. “I will tell you, we talked about it, we talked about it a lot, he did want Ukraine, but I said, ‘You’re not going into Ukraine,’” Trump continued. “He would never, ever have gone into Ukraine.” Minutes earlier, Hannity had prompted Trump to denounce Putin. “I asked you the last time you were on, whether you think that this is evil in our time,” Hannity said. “Do you believe this is evil in our time?” Trump did not answer the question; instead ,he ranted about NATO. “Don’t forget, I rebuilt NATO,” Trump falsely claimed. Trump also called what was happening in Ukraine a “genocide,” joining President Joe Biden in characterizing Russia’s atrocities as such. Trump: I knew Putin very well. Almost as well as I know you Sean. pic.twitter.com/Ch0Lvytj7N — Acyn (@Acyn) April 14, 2022 Last month, Hannity tried twice to get Trump to condemn Putin during an on-air interview, to no avail. Trump also faced backlash after initially praising what he called the authoritarian leader’s “genius” strategy for invading Ukraine.He has repeatedly insisted that Putin would not have dared invade Ukraine if he was still president. Hannity and Trump’s eldest sons have offered their own commentary on the former president’s relationship to Putin. Hannity said Trump’s praise of the Russian president was “taken out of context.” Donald Trump Jr. claimed his dad’s affection for dictators was an act in order to “play these guys.” And Eric Trump lauded his father’s “great relationship” with Putin and claimed that if he was still running the country, he would have simply called Putin and said, “Vladimir, don’t even think about” invading Ukraine. There have been thousands of civilian casualties in Ukraine since the war began in February and Russian troops have been accused of indiscriminately bombing residential areas and targeting civilian shelters. The mayor of Mariupol said this week that more than 20,000 civilian residents had been killed in the invasion. According to the United Nations, some 10 million people in Ukraine have fled their homes. This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.
