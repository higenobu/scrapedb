3/4/2022,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has publicly disclosed a batch of stock trades made by her husband in January. According to the disclosure, Paul Pelosi's new investments include $2.9 million in Apple, Walt Disney, PayPal, and Amex shares. A House panel is due to debate a congressional stock trading ban that could include lawmakers' spouses. Nancy Pelosi has publicly disclosed her husband's investments in January, which include $2.9 million worth of American Express, Apple, PayPal, and Walt Disney stocks. According to a periodic transaction report dated Monday, Pelosi's husband invested between $250,000 and $500,000 in asset management firm AllianceBernstein. Under the STOCK Act, lawmakers must disclose stock transactions — be it their own or of family members — within 45 days. The disclosure comes amid calls by lawmakers for members of Congress and their spouses to be barred from trading individual stocks. On Thursday, Insider's Kimberly Leonard reported that a US House panel plans to meet on March 16 to debate a congressional stock trading ban. Punchbowl News reported in February that Pelosi was working on the ban. While she rejected the idea of a ban in December, she changed course the following month, signaling that she would be okay with letting lawmakers decide for themselves about it. However, Pelosi has been largely noncommital on whether spouses should be included in any proposed ban. The upcoming House panel meeting follows the release of Insider's ""Conflicted Congress"" report — a five-month investigation that found that dozens of lawmakers and at least 182 senior congressional staffers had failed to comply with the reporting requirements of the STOCK Act. Pelosi's husband, financier Paul Pelosi, has been lauded as a star stock-picker for his winning trades, even prompting TikTokers to mimic his investments. His holdings in corporations — including Slack, Tesla, Alphabet, Facebook, and Netflix — have placed his wife in the 13th spot on Insider's list of 25 wealthiest members of Congress.

3/4/2022,"Russian troops seized the Ukrainian city of Kherson on Wednesday. The city's mayor told residents to follow Russian orders and not to fight back. As a port city, Kherson allows Russia to import equipment into Ukraine via the Black Sea. The mayor of Kherson, the Ukrainian port city that fell to Russian forces on Wednesday, said residents should follow the orders of occupying troops and refrain from fighting back. Ihor Kolykhaiev wrote on Facebook late Wednesday that ""armed visitors"" had entered the city council building. ""I just asked them not to shoot people. We don't have the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the city, only civilians and people who want to LIVE here,"" he wrote. He also published a list of rules and advisories for residents to follow, including that civilians ""stop at the first request"" and ""do not fight."" The others are: To only go out into the city during the day. To abide by a 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. Only cars carrying food or medicines can enter the city. Public transport will run so that workers in bakeries, shops, and pharmacies can go to work. Pedestrians must walk one by one or two by two. Cars must drive slowly and consent to searches. ""The flag flying over us is Ukrainian,"" Kolykhaiev wrote. ""And for it to stay that way, these demands must be observed."" Kherson is the first major Ukrainian city to fall under Russian control. As a port city, it is strategically important as it allows Russia to import military equipment into Ukraine via the Black Sea. Kherson's regional governor, Hennadiy Laguta, said Thursday that Russian forces had taken over the region's administration building, Reuters reported. Ukraine's military told Sky News' Deborah Haynes on Thursday that the city was not totally under Russian control, and that troops were using it as a ""temporary base"" for units to transfer. A Kherson resident told Insider's Sinéad Baker hours before the city fell on Wednesday that Russian troops were ""everywhere"" and that people were too scared to walk outside in case they got shot.

3/4/2022,"Tucker Carlson admitted he was wrong about the Russian invasion of Ukraine during his opening monologue on Thursday night’s “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” but still found a way to twist the blame around on the Biden Administration. Specifically, the Fox News host asserted that he never took the situation seriously because President Joe Biden sent Vice President Kamala Harris to Europe as the world feared imminent war. Carlson opened his show by addressing breaking news of a fire at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, which broke out Thursday after Russian shelling. “So, the situation appears to be more chaotic by the day, possibly even spinning out of control,” Carlson said in response. “And that, we must be honest, is shocking to us. We’ve been taken by surprise by the whole thing. We’re not the only ones who were, but we’re willing to admit it. The only thing more embarrassing than being wrong in your estimates is pretending that you weren’t. So why didn’t we see this coming, this total loss of control?” After backpedaling on his Russia-Ukraine conflict stance, he pivoted the blame to Democrats, going on to say that his failure to take the situation seriously was due to Harris’ attendance at the Munich Security Conference in February. “Well, because we assumed that if things were dire, serious people would be involved in fixing them. But we looked up and we saw Kamala Harris involved, and that reassured us,” Carlson said. “Harris had just come back from Europe where she’d been conducting quote, ‘diplomacy’ with our allies, and that appeared to be proof this could not really be a big deal.” “If the situation in Ukraine had been legitimately serious, if the future of Europe and the world hung in the balance as now so obviously it does, of course the Biden administration would not have sent Kamala Harris to fix it, because that’s not her job,” he continued. “Kamala Harris’ job is to trot down to the Blue Room periodically to greet delegations of Tiktok influencers or to cut occasional PSAs for Children’s Dental Health Awareness Month, which is in February, so we assumed she’d be working on that right now. “We didn’t underestimate Vladimir Putin, we overestimated Joe Biden,” Carlson said before playing a series of clips showing Harris in light-hearted moments. “This is just not a serious person, not surrounded by serious people,” he followed. After months of pro-Kremlin comments, Carlson received widespread criticism for his remarks downplaying the Russia-Ukraine conflict last week, even as Russia launched the invasion. He minimized the conflict as a mere “border dispute” and questioned what he described as a sense of “a patriotic duty to hate Vladimir Putin.” “It may be worth asking yourself, since it is getting pretty serious, what is this really about? Why do I hate Putin so much?” he said on his Feb. 22 show. “Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him?” “But Joe Biden likes Ukraine, so Putin bad, war good,” he added at the time. Carlson concluded Thursday’s bizarre rant against Harris with a bit about her dating history, referencing her past relationship with Montel Williams — not his first time fixating on the relationship. “So if you’re looking for someone to date Montel Williams, well maybe she’s the person you would choose,” he said. “She could be a solid choice, she’s done it before. Dating Montel Williams – you know – is something that’s within her range of experience. Is she good at it? We can’t say. But she’s done it. But this new gig? De-escalating a world-ending conflict with the nuclear-armed rogue state? No. No, not when nuclear reactors are on fire. But they’re doing it anyway.”",World/The Wrap,"Tucker Carlson Admits He Was ‘Wrong’ About Russian Invasion of Ukraine, Bizarrely Blames Kamala Harris",https://news.yahoo.com/tucker-carlson-admits-wrong-russian-052442009.html
