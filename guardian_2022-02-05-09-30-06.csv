2/5/2022,"Ralf Rangnick blamed Manchester United for their 8-7 penalty defeat to Middlesbrough, the interim manager saying that being knocked out of the FA Cup was “our own fault”. The fourth-round loss at Old Trafford all but ends United’s hopes of ending a five-year trophy drought as Rangnick’s misfiring team are outsiders for the Champions League and 19 points behind Manchester City in the Premier League.  While Anthony Elanga missed the crucial spot-kick, Rangnick contended that Matt Crooks’s second half equaliser should not have stood after Duncan Watmore’s handball in the lead-up to the goal was adjudged accidental by Anthony Taylor and VAR. “How can it be accidental if he controls the ball up in the air with his hand? It was clear it should not stand but in the end I was really surprised it stood,” said Rangnick. Watmore said: “If I’m honest, it was completely accidental. I know it touched my hand but it wasn’t intentional at all. I was hoping it wouldn’t be handball and wasn’t expecting it but I haven’t seen it back and it doesn’t feel like it at the time.” Rangnick was clear, though, that United were culpable for the loss. “In the first half we should have easily been 3-0 up and second half we had chances too. We should have won the game in normal time. On penalties it can happen what happened today,” he said. “We have to take our chances better and with more quality than we did today. It was our own fault – we should not have gone into extra time and penalties. For example, Bruno [Fernandes] chance [near the end] – if he has 10 of these in a match he scores nine. “Today he hit the post, tried to place it too exactly – these things can happen, obviously he didn’t do that on purpose.” Middlesbrough’s manager, Chris Wilder, said: “The FA Cup is alive and kicking – I told the players it was all about making memories. We rode our luck and took our chances. I thought straight away it was handball – I thought it would be chalked out and delighted it wasn’t.”",Sport/Football,"Manchester United’s exit from FA Cup ‘our own fault’, says Ralf Rangnick",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/manchester-uniteds-exit-from-fa-cup-our-own-fault-says-ralf-rangnick
2/5/2022,"Tube workers are to go on strike for two days next month over fears for jobs, pensions and working conditions, threatening widespread disruption across London. The RMT union announced that its members on the tube would walk out on 1 and 3 March.  It came as a funding arrangement between the government and Transport for London was extended for two weeks. The arrangement was due to end on Friday. A Transport for London spokesperson said: “We continue to discuss our funding requirements with the government … We have today agreed with the government that our existing funding agreement will be extended until 18 February 2022 so that these discussions can be concluded.” Earlier, the union said it had had no assurances as Transport for London continues to look for ways to balance its finances after passenger numbers and revenue fell drastically during the pandemic, with central government refusing to confirm emergency funding will continue. A ballot of more than 10,000 members resulted in 94% backing industrial action, although TfL said only about 50% of staff had voted. Mick Lynch, the RMT general secretary, said: “Our members will be taking strike action next month because a financial crisis at London Underground (LUL) has been deliberately engineered by the government to drive a cuts agenda, which would savage jobs, services, safety and threaten their working conditions and‎ pensions. “These are the very same transport staff praised as heroes for carrying London through Covid for nearly two years. Staff will not pay the price for this cynically engineered crisis.” TfL said it would be open to talks and urged the RMT to “do the right thing for London and call off this unnecessary action”. Andy Lord said the strike call was “extremely disappointing”. TfL’s chief operating officer said no proposals had been tabled on pensions or terms and conditions, and nobody would lose their jobs. He said: “The devastating impact of the pandemic on TfL finances has made a programme of change urgently necessary and we need the RMT to work with us, rather than disrupting London’s recovery.” TfL has commissioned an independent review of staff pension arrangements, as a condition of the funding released by central government last year. It has also said it will not fill about 250 vacant customer service posts nor replace about 250-350 more when staff leave or retire, cutting the overall numbers by about 10%-12%. Meanwhile, the TSSA union said it would act if Network Rail attempted to make staff compulsorily redundant on the national railway. Network Rail is planning to cut more than 900 further jobs, which the union said were “predominantly professional and technical staff who ensure the safe running of our railways”. Manuel Cortes, the TSSA leader, said: “Tory cuts are bulldozing our rail industry. Their so-called levelling-up is a fallacy. Sadly, the message for passengers is you are paying more for less.” The growing row over deeper cuts to rail – with operators already told to find huge savings – came as the Department for Transport launched its competition to locate the headquarters of the proposed Great British Railways, as part of Keith Williams’ and Grant Shapps’ reforms announced last May. A public poll will influence the decision. Railway towns including Crewe, Derby and York are expected contenders, as well as Milton Keynes, which stands to lose its established Network Rail head office.",News/UK news,"Tube workers to strike over jobs, pensions and working conditions",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/04/tube-workers-strike-march-jobs-pensions-working-conditions-rmt
2/5/2022,"Mike Pence, the former US vice president, has issued his strongest rebuke yet of Donald Trump, insisting that his old boss is “wrong” to claim that Pence could have overturned the 2020 election. The unusually blunt criticism suggests that Pence, unswervingly loyal during his four years serving under Trump at the White House, is running out of patience with the ex-president’s assault on democracy.  “I heard this week that president Trump said I had the right to overturn the election,” Pence told a conference hosted by the conservative Federalist Society in Florida on Friday. “President Trump is wrong. I had no right to overturn the election.” The Republican former governor of Indiana added: “The presidency belongs to the American people and the American people alone. Frankly there is almost no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose the American president.” “Under the constitution, I had no right to change the outcome of our election. And [current vice-president] Kamala Harris will have no right to overturn the election when we beat them in 2024.” The intervention came after Trump issued a statement last Sunday pushing the false narrative that Pence could have “overturned” the presidential election on 6 January 2021 in his role presiding over the counting of electoral college votes by Congress. Constitutional scholars, politicians and Pence himself have determined that the vice-president has no such power and play only a ceremonial role. Members of Congress are currently working on reforming the Electoral Count Act to clear up any lingering ambiguities. The issue appears to have caused an irrevocable rift between Trump and Pence, who has faced booing and heckling from followers of the Make America Great Again movement. Pence recently revealed that he has not spoken to his former boss since last summer. In a statement on Tuesday, Trump, who has pushed bogus claims for voter fraud, said the House of Representatives committee investigating the deadly January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol should instead look at “why Mike Pence did not send back the votes for recertification or approval”. Pence was rushed from the Senate chamber that day and forced to lie low for hours in an underground car park. Trump did not call him to check on his safety even as a mob laid siege to Capitol chanting: “Hang Mike Pence!” In his speech on Friday, Pence acknowledged the disappointment of the 2020 loss to Joe Biden but argued that “we did our duty”. He went on: “The truth is there’s more at stake than our party or political fortunes. If we lose faith in the constitution, we won’t just lose elections. We lose our country.” He described January 6 as a “dark day” but, as in other recent public remarks, accused Democrats of blowing it out of proportion. Pence will not allow them to “use the actions of those who ransacked the Capitol to demean” the 74 million Americans who voted for him and Trump, he said. While Pence has previously noted that he and Trump are never likely to see “eye to eye” over the events of January 6, his speech on Friday marked his most direct rebuttal to date. The once unthinkable split is only likely to fuel speculation that the 62-year-old is laying the groundwork for a potential run for president in 2024, setting up a possible showdown with Trump, who has been hinting at a campaign of his own. Pence would face an uphill struggle in the current political climate. On Friday the Republican National Committee (RNC) censured Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, two Republicans sitting on the January 6 committee. Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the RNC, said the pair were joining in a persecution of ordinary citizens who engaged in “legitimate political discourse”. Adonna Biel, a spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee, said: “Let’s be very clear — former Vice President Mike Pence doesn’t deserve credit for ‘breaking’ with Trump after standing shoulder to shoulder with him for nearly six years.” “Pence stood silent as Trump undermined our democracy, and he surely could have done more before Trump incited a mob to attack the Capitol, assault police officers, and try to overturn an election. “On the same day the Republican Party voted to declare the January 6 insurrection ‘legitimate political discourse,’ it could not be more clear that Pence’s comments today are a day late and a dollar short, to say the least.”",News/US news,‘He is wrong’: Pence rebuts Trump claim that he could have overturned election,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/04/mike-pence-rebukes-donald-trump-election-claims-florida
