4/22/2022,"Afew weeks ago, the Daily Mail ran a lengthy feature exploring how “eco-crazy councils turned our streets into Gridlock Britain”. It begins with a heartrending and in no way manipulative story about how the traffic jams in the north London borough of Islington are upsetting a disabled 13-year-old boy. Across the river in Lambeth, the council is celebrating a victory after the court of appeal declined to order a judicial review into three different low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) across the borough. No matter: the local Tories have promised that, in the unlikely event they win next month’s council elections, they’ll scrap them all anyway. Don’t imagine, though, that the row over LTNs is restricted to either inner London or the political right. In Oxford, Labour’s former shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds has said she’s “increasingly concerned” about the rollout of such schemes, and called on Oxfordshire county council to pause them pending measures to prioritise buses. If the Lib Dem/Labour/Green coalition running the council is disappointed by this response from a Labour frontbencher, they can take some comfort from the fact that she was, at least, polite. Last summer one local communicated their views of the policy by setting fire to a planter. Few issues in local politics spark the passion, not to mention hysteria, that has greeted the rise of low-traffic neighbourhoods. As well as the fires (there have been several), campaigns against them have included vandalism, doxxing and placards depicting council leaders as military dictators. Graffiti has appeared accusing councils of “abuse of power” or, inevitably, blaming Sadiq Khan, who has had nothing to do with any of this. Councillors and private campaigners alike have reported death threats. All of which seems a pretty unhinged response to a policy intended to make streets a tiny bit nicer for those without cars. Low-traffic neighbourhoods, after all, aren’t doing anything as radical as, say, banning cars. They’re merely a gentle attempt – a new bollard here, a planter full of flowers there – to close off rat runs and keep through traffic to main roads. They’re nothing new, either: outer London boroughs including Waltham Forest and Kingston have had LTNs ever since Transport for London introduced its “mini-Hollands” scheme in 2014. Go to Walthamstow now, and you’ll find a glorious world of segregated cycle paths, quiet sidestreets and minor changes in road surface, intended to communicate that any motor vehicle passing through should be aware they’re in someone else’s space. But they have expanded rather a lot of late. In May 2020, in the middle of lockdown with the need for social distancing at its height, the Department for Transport called on councils to reallocate road space from cars to cyclists and pedestrians. At the same time, transport secretary Grant Shapps announced the government’s £250m “emergency active travel fund”. About 50 councils created about 200 LTNs – often, thanks to the temporary and emergency nature of the interventions, without consulting the public. Some of the benefits of LTNs – reducing air pollution, preventing journey planning apps from telling drivers to use your street as a shortcut – are pretty obvious. Others are not. For one thing, researchers have found that those living inside mini-Hollands are more active, with benefits for the health service. Past studies have found that those living on low-traffic streets are more likely to have friends locally, too. Between all that and halcyon images of kids playing in the street, you start to wonder why anyone wouldn’t want to live in an LTN. Part of the problem, in fact, is that not everyone can. Diverting through traffic towards main roads is likely to mean more traffic on the main roads. In many cases that problem should, eventually, solve itself thanks to the magic of “traffic evaporation”: the phenomenon by which people switch to walking, cycling or public transport, because driving is just too big a pain in the arse. That, though, can take a while, and in the meantime traffic is going to get worse. Another problem is that changes like this do create losers as well as winners – people who for one reason or another genuinely need to drive, and object to being sent, literally, all round the houses – and that it’s in the nature of things for them to shout a lot more loudly than those who benefit. Perhaps the biggest issue, though, is that those pandemic LTNs were introduced in a tearing rush, as councils raced to grab a limited pot of funding. That meant a lack of consultation over temporary schemes (although councils are required to consult before making them permanent). What’s more, it would hardly be a surprise if under-resourced councils moving at speed failed to distinguish between decent schemes that would cause some temporary increase in traffic, and badly designed ones that would cause genuine, longer-term problems. A number of schemes introduced in 2020 have since been suspended. For all that, though, it’s hard to shake the suspicion that at least some of the hysteria is just that people don’t like being inconvenienced. There are those who could walk or cycle, and whose lives would improve if they did. But they don’t want to. They want to drive, and they want to drive the most direct route, and until they can they’re going to shout at anyone trying to stop them. As well as stories of angry protests and vandalised planters, the past two years have brought footage of cars literally driving on the pavement to bypass an obstacle, rather than accepting that this route is now closed to them. Some drivers just assume their car is a god-given right, probably enshrined in Magna Carta. They are, though, in the minority. A recent Centre for London poll found that only 12% of Londoners considered LTNs an important issue in the upcoming local elections; a 2021 survey conducted by Redfield and Wilton Strategies for the New Statesman found that twice as many people supported as opposed them. Like your car, in a traffic jam, LTNs are here to stay.

4/22/2022,"Thor’s journey from sullen princeling to selfless hero and down to beer-swilling layabout (then once again to hero) has perhaps been the most radical of any main player in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It’s also the ultimate rebuff to the naysayers who declare that superhero movies are lazy money-making vehicles that simply repeat the same storylines over and over again. It has certainly given Chris Hemsworth a gargantuan sandpit to play in, especially since director Taika Waititi spotted the obvious comic potential and began to play up his lovable buffoon persona in 2017’s brilliant Thor: Ragnarok. That journey is a big reason why the forthcoming Thor: Love and Thunder (also directed by Waititi) is such a tantalising prospect: we just don’t know where the film-maker is going to take the superhero next. No longer king of Asgard, a title he relinquished to Tessa Thompson’s Valkyrie at the end of Avengers: Endgame, Hemsworth’s Thor is theoretically free to hop through space in the company of the Guardians of the Galaxy for as long as it takes him to find his place in the cosmos. Unfortunately for Hemsworth, the debut trailer for Love and Thunder, which landed this week, seems to suggest that Marvel has other plans for the son of Odin. The concept of a female Thor replacing the male incumbent has already been played out at length in the Jason Aaron-penned The Mighty Thor comics. Now we get our first look at Natalie Portman’s Jane Foster wielding Mjolnir and apparently ready to take on the mantle of Thor – presumably because Hemsworth’s god of thunder is no longer cutting it. All of this makes a certain sense, if you think about Thor’s past adventures and where he’s ended up. You might think the idea of the superhero gadding about the universe on a journey of self-discovery perfectly reasonable after the horrors he has faced over the past few movies. Let us not forget that Thor has lost his parents and his brother Loki, plus at one point felt himself responsible for the deaths of half the population of the galaxy after he failed to take his chance to tonk Thanos during the events of Avengers: Infinity War. If he needs some time off, good on him. The off the grid version of Thor has also been hugely more entertaining for audiences than the slightly po-faced iteration introduced by Kenneth Branagh in 2011, whether it be teaming up with the Hulk to defeat Cate Blanchett’s Hela in Ragnarok, or growing a splendid beer belly in Endgame. Ultimately, though, this is not really who Thor is supposed to be. Branagh’s version learned early on that his powers and position come at a price: fall short, and they are ripped from him by Odin, who in the 2011 movie banishes him to Earth without his superpowers or ability to wield Mjolnir. Back then it was arrogance that caused Thor to be punished – could it be that indolence is the cause this time around? The one-time heir to Asgard even says in the trailer that he no longer wishes to be a superhero. The problem for Waititi and the Marvel team is that there are only so many times Thor can hit rock bottom before even this bounteous plot device becomes boring. Moreover, it is hard to see how the studio can elevate the new, Portman-portrayed god of thunder without denigrating the original. Might female Thor only hang around for a couple of movies before passing the mantle back to her predecessor, as happened in the comics? Let’s hope not, for that would be a strange way to bring Portman back into the Marvel fold, nine years after her last appearance as Foster in the underwhelming Thor: The Dark World. Let’s also hope the weird and rather unsavoury comic book line, which sees the new Thor becoming increasingly riven by cancer every time she wields Mjolnir, is left out of the big-screen adaptation altogether. Most of all, let’s hope Hemsworth’s Thor finds a path back to courage and valour that still allows us to benefit from the Australian actor’s fabulous comedy chops. At some point, we need to remember that he really is still a superhero, and not just a clownish sidekick.",Arts/Film,Will Natalie Portman’s Thor mean the end of Chris Hemsworth’s take?

4/22/2022,"India and the UK will press ahead with talks on a bilateral free trade agreement, Boris Johnson and the Indian premier, Narendra Modi, have said, after the UK made clear it was willing to make immigration part of any deal. The pair appeared to differ on how rapidly an agreement could be made – Johnson suggested it could be ready by the festival of Diwali in late October, but Modi pointed to the end of the year. Johnson said: “As the next round of talks begin here next week, we’re telling our negotiators, get it done by Diwali in October.” Modi said there had been “good progress and we have decided to make all efforts to conclude the FTA [free trade agreement] by the end of this year”. Three rounds of talks had already been held. Johnson and Modi were speaking together at Hyderabad House in Delhi, where they were holding bilateral talks, as Johnson’s two-day visit to India draws to a close. Downing Street had hoped the trip would demonstrate the prime minister’s determination to focus on investment, jobs and security, but it has been overshadowed by events at home. On Thursday, Johnson’s allies were unable to prevent MPs supporting an investigation into whether he misled parliament over Partygate, and the senior MP Steve Baker, a former Johnson supporter, joined the ranks of those calling for him to go. India had been keen to make increased access to the UK for its citizens part of any trade agreement, and Johnson signalled on Thursday he was willing to make concessions in this area – something previous UK governments had refused to do. Asked whether he was willing to offer more visas as part of a deal, he told ITV: “The UK actually has a massive shortage in some sectors like IT. Some estimates say we are hundreds of thousands of people short. So what you can have is controlled migration, which allows you to bring in talented people who can really help your economy. He added: “We won’t give these things away lightly – we want to make sure we get a proper deal. There is room to do a fantastic deal.” The UK hopes its car industry and food and drinks manufacturers could benefit if tariffs are lowered under a deal. The government is under pressure to deliver further trade deals, with the hoped-for post-Brexit deal with Washington on the backburner as President Biden focuses on other issues. Johnson had promised to raise difficult issues with Modi, including India’s ambivalent stance on Ukraine – though Johnson said en route to India that it was important to acknowledge the country’s longstanding relationship with Russia. Delivering a statement alongside Johnson, Modi called for an “immediate ceasefire” in Ukraine, and emphasised the importance of diplomacy, but did not criticise Russia, which is India’s biggest supplier of arms. India has abstained from successive UN motions condemning Russia, and continues to buy Moscow’s oil. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, met Modi in Delhi earlier this month, and insisted the two countries would continue to find ways to trade, despite western sanctions on Russia. The UK announced during Johnson’s visit that it would liberalise arms exports to India, as the countries deepen their cooperation of defence. The government will issue an open general export licence for India, which will mean separate licences are not needed for individual contracts.",News/World news,India and UK to press ahead with talks on free trade deal,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/22/india-and-uk-to-press-ahead-with-talks-on-free-trade-deal-modi-johnson
4/22/2022,"Birds of prey are being put at risk by the disbanding of one of the country’s leading wildlife crime teams, campaigners have warned, raising fears it could be part of a nationwide pattern. Wildlife crime officers work to stop offences such as raptor persecution, where birds of prey are poisoned or shot by gamekeepers and landowners. Earlier this year, a rare white-tailed sea eagle was found poisoned on an estate in Dorset. The local wildlife policing team opened an investigation led by PC Claire Dinsdale, a recipient of the Queen’s police medal for her work on wildlife crime. But weeks later, the case was abruptly closed, and a search on the estate where the eagle was found dead was cancelled. The RSPB described this decision as “baffling”. Around the same time, the local wildlife crime team was rebranded – removing “wildlife” from its name. Dorset police rural wildlife and heritage crime was renamed as Dorset police rural crime team on its Twitter account, and police sources confirmed this rebrand took place to “reflect the broader work we are undertaking to ensure we provide exceptional local policing to our rural communities”. The wildlife crime section of the local policing website has also been removed. Dinsdale then went on leave, and the Guardian understands that she has been told that on her return she will no longer be a wildlife crime lead. Sources who were part of the white-tailed eagle death investigation told the Guardian that they were concerned about the hostility to wildlife crime investigations in the area, pointing out that the local MP, Chris Loder, said that police funding should be focused on other crimes. Wildlife groups fear that influential landowners who have interests in removing police focus from wildlife crime could take inspiration from the situation in Dorset, and that this pattern could be repeated throughout the country. Dr Ruth Tingay, a co-founder of wildlife campaign group Wild Justice and author of the Raptor Persecution blog, said: “If police wildlife crime teams are disbanding or rebranding to exclude wildlife crime, this flies in the face of government and police commitments to tackle wildlife crime, and particularly raptor persecution which is supposed to be a national wildlife crime priority but is on the rise according to the latest annual reports. “There is absolutely no justification whatsoever for ignoring these crimes when there is a statutory duty for raptors to be protected.” The RSPB, which is still conducting its own investigations into bird poisoning in Dorset, said it was concerned by the changes in Dorset police. RSPB’s head of investigations, Mark Thomas, said: “RSPB Investigations enjoy a good working relationship with police wildlife and rural crime teams across the UK, especially in relation to fighting raptor persecution, the illegal killing of birds of prey, most often relating to land used for gamebird shooting. “Dorset police … has been an exemplary force to work with. We obviously have concerns if the level of response from any force to wildlife crime incidents was diminished in any way, as there is clearly lots of work to be done, especially at a time when raptor persecution is at a modern day high and we have suspicious deaths of amazing birds like white-tailed eagles.” A spokesperson for Dorset police said: “Dorset police is committed to keeping everyone in our county safe, including our wildlife, which brings so much to our beautiful countryside and our communities. “As part of the police uplift programme and working together with the office of the police and crime commissioner we have reviewed our rural crime strategy for the county and allocated increased numbers of officers to the rural crime team to tackle the issues that matter. This includes all aspects of rural, wildlife and heritage-related crime. “We will continue to work closely with many different partner agencies in relation to these issues. We want to make it clear that we take any and all potential wildlife offences seriously and will act to prevent and detect offences wherever possible.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We recognise the importance of tackling wildlife crime and those who hurt animals should be subject to the full force of the law. However, it is for operationally independent chief constables and elected police and crime commissioners to align their resources to tackle local priorities.”",News/Environment,Disbanding of Dorset wildlife crime team puts birds of prey ‘at risk’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/22/disbanding-of-dorset-wildlife-team-puts-birds-pray-at-risk

The promiseA quirky if convoluted TikTok hack suggests that “increasing your hair’s contact time” with products by repeatedly washing it in the same water will improve its condition. The testThe first step is a cinch: I just wash and condition my hair as usual, then comb through a curl cream (I like Bouclème Curl Cream, £19, because it’s silicone-free, so super lightweight), followed by a leave-in conditioner. Then I exit the shower, fill a bowl with warm water and, in a step that seems as if it’s washing out the product, flip my hair over my head and dip it into the bowl. Using my hands to scrunch the curls, I dunk again in the same water and repeat, then leave it to air-dry.

4/22/2022,"Ben Roberts-Smith’s patrol commander on a controversial SAS mission in an Afghan village has defended his evidence in court as truthful, after being accused of colluding with Roberts-Smith to cover up the murder of two prisoners. The cross-examination of a retired SAS patrol commander, anonymised before the court as Person 5, focused on a mission raiding a compound known as Whiskey 108, in the Uruzgan village of Kakarak in southern Afghanistan, on Easter Sunday in 2009. Person 5 was Roberts-Smith’s patrol commander on the mission. The pair has been accused by three newspapers of being jointly responsible for the unlawful killing of an elderly man found hiding inside a tunnel discovered in the compound, while Roberts-Smith is additionally accused of machine-gunning to death a disabled man found in the tunnel. Both Roberts-Smith and Person 5 say no people were found inside the tunnel, contrary to evidence given by other Australian soldiers. Person 5 told the court two Afghan men killed during the raid were “EKIA” – enemy killed in action, or legitimate targets lawfully killed in combat – outside the compound. He said he had previously believed that the men who were killed had likely escaped via an alternative exit out of the tunnel to the area outside the compound, and were attempting to flee, but conceded before court that he later learned there was no other exit to the tunnel. Roberts-Smith, a recipient of the Victoria Cross, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing. Nick Owens SC, acting for the newspapers, said to Person 5: “I put it to you, that you are making up a version of these engagements to try to conceal the fact that two PUCs [persons under control] were found in the tunnel; one was executed outside the compound, and one was executed inside the tunnel courtyard.” Person 5 replied: “I don’t agree with that.” Owens accused Person 5 of “making up this lie” because he “knew there had to be an explanation for why two people you knew came out of the tunnel were found dead”. Person 5 said: “That’s not correct.” The newspapers allege both Roberts-Smith and Person 5 were jointly involved in the unlawful killing of an elderly Afghan man found hiding in the tunnel inside Whiskey 108. The newspapers allege Roberts-Smith was present when Person 5 ordered another Australian soldier – Person 4 – to execute the elderly man. “Pursuant to that order Person 4 placed [the Afghan man] on his knees and shot him in the back of the head. Person 4 was ordered to execute [the Afghan man] so that he could be ‘blooded’,” the defence document states. The newspapers allege Roberts-Smith “did not say or do anything to encourage Person 5 to withdraw the order or to stop Person 4 following the order”, arguing that he was complicit in, and approved of, the man’s murder. The newspapers, and two other Australian soldier witnesses, have alleged that the second man found in the tunnel, a disabled man with a prosthetic leg, was “frog-marched” out of the compound by Roberts-Smith, where he was thrown to the ground and machine-gunned to death. One Australian soldier described it as an “exhibition execution”. Both Person 5 and Roberts-Smith have rejected the newspapers’ version of events as false. Roberts-Smith has told the court the man with the prosthetic leg was armed and running when he shot and killed him, while the elderly man was shot by another Australian soldier. Person 5 said repeatedly on Friday “there were no people in the tunnel”. And he told the court “no-one was executed at that compound”. Earlier this week, the court heard Person 5 was in regular contact with Roberts-Smith, whom he described as a “good friend”, and who began to contact him from changing Australian mobile numbers, and communicating by encrypted phone apps, after newspaper stories about the mission were published in 2018. Owens put it to Person 5 he had colluded with Roberts-Smith over their version of events at Whiskey 108. “Colluding? No,” Person 5 said. “There’s been collusion, but not from our side. Your witnesses have been colluding for the last 12 years.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Person 5 said he and Roberts-Smith spoke “about the mission” at Whiskey 108, but did not discuss their evidence before the inspector general of the Australian defence force who was investigating allegations of war crimes, nor their evidence before this trial. “There was no collusion ... we were trying to work out where the hell this [the media reports] was coming from.” The court heard evidence about a PowerPoint document prepared by Person 5 showing an aerial picture of the Whiskey 108 compound which he sent to Roberts-Smith, who marked it with details of the mission such as the location of troops, entries to buildings and bodies. The document was also sent to another soldier. Eighteen soldier witnesses have already appeared in this trial, called by the newspapers. The court also heard this week that a total of five murder allegations had been made against the patrol commanded by Person 5. Two of them relate to Whiskey 108; three more – which are not part of this defamation action – related to a mission on a compound known as Whiskey 591 on 14 May 2010. Person 5 remains in the witness box.

4/22/2022,"The House of Lords commissioners for standards have launched an investigation into a second Conservative peer for allegedly breaching the rules against peers profiting financially from their membership of the Lords. The investigation into the Earl of Shrewsbury, an elected hereditary Conservative peer who has been a member of the Lords for 41 years, has been announced by the standards commissioners on their website. The rules alleged to have been breached by the earl, whose full name is Charles Henry John Benedict Crofton Chetwynd Chetwynd-Talbot, are the same as those over which his fellow Tory peer Michelle Mone is also under investigation. They include the requirements in the Lords code of conduct that members “must not seek to profit from membership of the house” by being rewarded for providing parliamentary services or advice; that they must register and declare all relevant interests, and they must not seek to benefit “by parliamentary means” any outside organisation in which they have an interest or in return for payment. The investigation into Mone relates to her alleged involvement in procuring £203m PPE contracts for a company, PPE Medpro. She has denied wrongdoing. The current Earl of Shrewsbury is the 22nd hereditary male holder of the title, which was first bestowed on his ancestor John Talbot in 1442, and generations of earls have been members of the Lords. He inherited his place in 1981, and was then elected in 1999 to serve as a Conservative hereditary peer. He has registered interests as a director in several companies, and runs his own company, Talbot Consulting. No details have been released about the substance of the commissioners’ investigation. A spokesperson for the Lords said: “At this stage information on this investigation remains confidential until it is completed and a report published. There isn’t any further information we can add other than what appears on the website at present.” The earl told the Guardian he was unable to comment. “The commission have told me that [if] I speak to anyone about their investigation I will be in contempt of parliament.
