12/26/2021,"More than 500,000 UK participants in one of the biggest ever surveys of the prevalence of Covid-19 have been given shopping vouchers worth more than £210m, figures reveal. The Covid-19 Infection Survey is the largest regular survey of coronavirus infections and antibodies in the UK, helping to provide information to shape the government’s response to the pandemic.  As an incentive to take tests, participants are offered vouchers. These can be redeemed for specific retailers, including supermarkets, fashion stores, hotels and airlines. Some households have picked up vouchers worth a total of more than £1,000. The Office for National Statistics (ONS), which jointly leads the survey with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), said participants were not obliged to accept the payouts, and that they were kept under regular review to ensure they were an effective incentive and offered value for money. New figures reveal that 528,541 enrolment vouchers, with a face value of £50 each, were issued between the start of the survey, in April 2020, and November 2021. The total value of these vouchers is £26,427,050.Participants, who are selected at random, are regularly visited by arrangement at weekly or monthly intervals to be tested for Covid and are given £25 vouchers for each visit. Vouchers worth £184,095,175 have been handed out for the testing visits. The vouchers can be spent at more than 100 outlets, including Argos, Asda, Sainsbury’s, Tesco, John Lewis, Deliveroo, Cineworld, All Bar One, Zizzi, Eurostar and Jet2holidays. The vouchers initially included Amazon among the retailers, but when details of the scheme first emerged, MPs questioned why the vouchers were not being targeted to ensure the cash would help boost high street stores. The Amazon vouchers are no longer available, but the ONS said this was not connected to any criticism of the online giant potentially benefiting from the scheme. The survey aims to find out how many people are getting Covid, how many people previously had Covid, and how many people have had a strong immune response to the vaccination. It is one of the largest surveys in the world of individuals sampled at random for possible infection. Dr James Doidge, a senior statistician at the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre, has described it as “one of the most valuable resources on the planet” in understanding the pandemic. One of the other major UK studies gathering data during the pandemic, the React study commissioned by DHSC and carried out by Imperial College London in partnership with Ipsos Mori and Imperial College healthcare NHS trust, does not offer vouchers. Each month more than 100,000 people across England are randomly sent a one-off nose/throat swab test to take at home. The ONS said: “The Covid-19 Infection Survey has been vital in understanding the spread of coronavirus in the community and informing the government’s pandemic response. “It is routine practice in surveys to offer modest compensation and the payment of vouchers was considered appropriate. Participants are not obliged to accept the vouchers; however, we offer them to reflect the time and inconvenience whole households experience taking part in this crucial study, and in particular allowing study workers to come to their homes.” The ONS and the DHSC carry out the study in partnership with the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, the UK Health Security Agency and the Wellcome Trust.",News/World news,Covid survey participants receive £210m in high street vouchers,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/26/covid-survey-participants-receive-210m-in-high-street-vouchers
12/26/2021,"In the winter break, away from the everyday craziness of my normal work schedule, one of my favourite annual rituals is to delve through the latest batch of seed catalogues. To me there is something so therapeutic about the escape of planning for a summer ahead, of colour and life, curled up safely away from the cold on the sofa. With so many beautiful and unusual new introductions on the horizon for 2022, here are four that have really caught my eye. As someone with a bit of an obsession for trialling out tomato varieties old and new, when I got wind of a novel, dwarf variety with good flavour, I had to investigate further. Growing to only around 70cm high, ‘Patio Plum’ has a really compact, stocky growth habit with curious crinkled leaves that look a bit like a savoy cabbage, which makes it far more visually striking than its rather boring name suggests. Unlike essentially all other varieties, this doesn’t produce side shoots, which we normally need to spend ages pruning out, and also offers a very respectable yield of fruit with a classic, rich tomato flavour.  If it is perennials you are after, Festuca ‘Sunrise’ to me is a real show-stopper. This deep green variety that flushes into a range of sunrise hues when it flowers in the summer, and intensifies as the leaf tips then join the show in the cooler months, creates a stunning graduated ombre effect. They are a great choice for any bright spot with well-drained soil. Truly blue flowers are actually incredibly rare in nature, and that’s because the compounds used to create this hue are metabolically tricky to make. Some garden designers, I have heard, will ask job candidates to list 20 blue flowers as the ultimate test of plant knowledge, and Corydalis ‘Blue Heron’ is as blue as they get. With electric azure flowers erupting each spring over soft, ferny foliage, this looks like it is a CGI species lifted from the scenes of Avatar. It’s a perfect plant of dappled shade that will stop visitors in their tracks in the early summer. Finally, if fruit and veg is your passion, might I offer a new fig variety that is really worth investigating further. ‘Little Miss Figgy’ is a super dwarf cultivar that at around 90cm never gets much taller than waist height. With finely divided, snowflake-like leaves, on plants that are hardy to at least -15C and suitable for pot culture, it seems to have everything. One small caveat: I have yet to try their flavour, but frankly anything would be better than the watery ‘Brown Turkey’ that currently dominates the market.

12/26/2021,"Desmond Tutu, the cleric and social activist who was a giant of the struggle against apartheid in South Africa, has died aged 90. Tutu, described by foreign observers and his countrymen as the moral conscience of his nation, died in Cape Town on Boxing Day.  “The passing of archbishop emeritus Desmond Tutu is another chapter of bereavement in our nation’s farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans who have bequeathed us a liberated South Africa,” president Cyril Ramaphosa said. “From the pavements of resistance in South Africa to the pulpits of the world’s great cathedrals and places of worship, and the prestigious setting of the Nobel peace prize ceremony, the Arch distinguished himself as a non-sectarian, inclusive champion of universal human rights.” Tutu was diagnosed with prostate cancer in the late 1990s and in recent years he was hospitalised on several occasions to treat infections associated with his treatment. “Ultimately, at the age of 90, he died peacefully at the Oasis Frail Care Centre in Cape Town this morning,” Dr Ramphela Mamphele, acting chairperson of the Archbishop Desmond Tutu IP Trust and coordinator of the Office of the Archbishop, said in a statement on behalf of the Tutu family. She did not give details on the cause of death. Tutu was born in Klerksdorp, a farming town 100 miles (160km) south-west of Johannesburg. The sickly son of a headteacher and a domestic servant, he trained first as a teacher before becoming an Anglican priest. As a cleric, he travelled widely, gaining an MA in theology from London University. Though he only emerged as a key figure in the liberation struggle in the mid-1970s, he was to have a huge impact, becoming a household name across the globe. Excitable, emotional, charismatic and highly articulate, Tutu won the Nobel peace prize in 1984. A vocal supporter of sanctions against South Africa, he was detested by supporters of the apartheid regime, who saw him as an agitator and traitor. Tutu was however protected not just by his wit and combative spirit but by his immense popularity and respect. In 1986 he was appointed archbishop of Cape Town, the effective head of the Anglican church in his homeland. Tutu always kept his distance from the African National Congress (ANC), the party which spearheaded the liberation movement and has now been in power in South Africa for more than 20 years. He refused to back its armed struggle and support unconditionally leaders such as Nelson Mandela. However Tutu shared Mandela’s vision of a multiracial society in which all communities live together without rancour or discrimination and is credited with coining the phrase “rainbow nation” to describe this vision. After the nation’s first free election in 1994, Mandela, who had become the president of a free South Africa, asked Tutu to chair of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), the controversial and emotional hearings into apartheid-era human rights abuses. The TRC was described as the “climax of Tutu’s career” and lauded across the world as a pioneering effort to heal deep historic wounds. However Tutu found the experience deeply traumatic. He was saddened and perplexed by the ferocious criticism from the white rightwing, some mainstream liberals and the ANC. The terrible testimony that he listened to day after day brought deep emotional stress too, with TV viewers watching as the tough, witty cleric put his head in his hands and wept. In late 1990s, Tutu, suffering prostate cancer, began to spend more time with his wife of 60 years, four children, and numerous grandchildren. He continued to criticise the ANC and was initially excluded from the state funeral of Nelson Mandela in 2013. His absence provoked a public outcry. Tutu later said he had been “very hurt.” Despite his illness, Tutu remained interested in world affairs and determined to use his enormous moral prestige to make a difference. In 2015, he launched a petition launched urging global leaders to create a world run on renewable energies within 35 years was backed by more than 300,000 people globally. It described climate change as “one of the greatest moral challenges of our time”. He also spoke out against homophobic legislation in Uganda and argued in favour of assisted dying. Mandela, who lived near Tutu’s home in Soweto and also won the Nobel prize, described his close friend as “sometimes strident, often tender, never afraid, seldom without humour.” “Desmond Tutu’s voice will always be the voice of the voiceless,” Mandela said. In 2009 Barack Obama described Tutu as “a crusader for freedom, a spiritual leader … and a respected statesman [who] has become a symbol of kindness and hope far beyond the borders of his native land.” Friends remembered Tutu as a man of deep faith whose charm, warmth and intelligence few could resist, and who was happiest when active on behalf of others. “I love to be loved,” he told the BBC’s Sue Lawley when appearing on Desert Island Discs in 1994.

12/26/2021,"Iam writing from the past, so many things remain uncertain for me about Christmas 2021. Will my husband’s parents have managed to adjust their tablet screen to show us something other than the ceiling, or my mother-in-law’s ear? Did we have our usual fight about my husband eating foods at a time other than that which I have arbitrarily decreed to be the correct time? (No crystal ball required for this: yes.) Where have we landed on the farce-to-fury British politics rollercoaster and how deftly has the Queen’s speech skirted it? Specifically, I find myself wondering what’s on television: not the programmes, the adverts. Usually, the evening of the 25th marks an abrupt shift from lingering shots of whatever salted caramel prawn crown Frankenfood Heston has dreamed up this year and baffling perfume ads in which Johnny Depp stamps on a guitar in cowboy boots then uses the shards to carve his name into a buffalo or something, to soft white sandy beaches lapped by Tiffany blue seas set to calypso tunes. Traditionally this is the travel industry’s peak period, as we collectively realise there is nothing to look forward to other than endless night and scrabble to book a fortnight in Crete, our deposit a down payment on optimism.  I enjoy this moment, which habitually marks my shift from anticlimactic Yule sulk (25 December, 8am onwards) to acceptance of the sofa-bound enfattening that follows. I can usually sag comfortably into these empty days, thanks to a TV-fuelled realisation that a time will eventually come when I won’t be sitting in the dark eating crumbs from my dressing gown at 3pm. But who’s planning a foreign holiday now? I have become so feral, I can barely restrain myself from meting out violent summary justice on speakerphone callers on a short bus journey; there’s no way I could survive a Ryanair flight. What with that, and trying to work out which Tory donor is least likely to mislay your £120 PCR, I would be astonished if the beleaguered travel industry is planning an all-singing, all-dancing Cop26 defying televisual hymn to the escapist glamour of international holidays this year. So what can we look forward to if it’s not getting out of here? I don’t imagine many of us will be tackling the seasonal slump at the Next sale: climate anxiety made even Christmas shopping a guilty, half-hearted business for me. I love writer Naomi Alderman’s suggestion of using multiple Advent calendars to incentivise yourself in the day-by-day trudge through January and February, but it’s probably too late for this year. Instead, why not try the social media trend that had a brief moment recently: find a photograph of yourself from exactly two years ago, before, well, you know. That might sound melancholy, but I promise you, it’s not. The only picture I could locate was taken at an axe throwing venue with my family, which is the kind of thing we did back then, apparently. I’m celebrating a fluke throw that hit the tiny bullseye, after an afternoon of dangerously casting axes everywhere but the target. Thrilled at my axe achievement, I look happily carefree, brighter and better rested, plumper of cheek, less bloodshot of eye. But apart from my axe exploits, I remember I was very exercised back then about a company’s inability to sell me the pint-sized mug I desired, genuinely upset and expending angry emailing time about this mug “issue”. Checking back through my messages, I see I was also fretting about my husband taking most of January off work and hanging around at home, my precious solo workspace. Ha. Two years later, the handle broke off my only intact pint mug last week as I carried it upstairs, spilling tea everywhere. Barely peeved, I called my husband, with whom I have been coworking and living 24/7 all this time. He came and helped me mop up, then we had a cup of coffee together, as we do most mornings. It was very nice, even with substandard mugs. I don’t believe adversity or stress necessarily makes you stronger: if it doesn’t work for paperclips, why would it for people? But here we all are, still going: wearier than our fresh-faced 2019 selves, having faced a bucketload of loss, fear and hardship, perhaps a touch wiser. That feels quite comforting to me. Of course, the other big advertising push this season is “new year, new you”: the promise of transformation through vegan meal deliveries, orthodontics or HIIT classes. I think this is, if anything, more doomed than travel ads – surely no one has the energy for self-improvement right now? Instead, that picture might, I hope, give you the sense that the person you are now is OK, really, but also that the end-of-2019 person you were still exists in some form. I know that mug-obsessed, small-stuff-sweating innocent I was is still in here somewhere under the dressing gown crumbs, behind the eye bags. I bet yours is, too. So that’s what I’m looking forward to: new year, same me, plus the hope of a hint of old me.",Lifestyle/Life and style,How a two-year-old photo might help shape the new you | Emma Beddington,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/26/how-a-two-year-old-photo-might-help-shape-the-new-you-emma-beddington
12/26/2021,"In Mayfield, Kentucky, storm warnings had been coming for days, then came radar observations of a rotating storm of debris to the south, and finally urgent alerts to the imminent strike of a severe tornado. In the seconds it took for the “quad-state” storm to pass over the higher elevations of the city soon after midnight on 10 December, the notional separation between the man-made and natural world was effectively obliterated – as were large sections of Mayfield  Damage to life and limb caused by the vast and powerful tornado that passed over Mayfield was epic and profound. The broader storm front also caused havoc as more than 30 powerful tornadoes tore through “Dixie Alley”. There were 76 dead in Kentucky alone, with eight lost in a candle factory where night-shift workers, some on work-release from jail, later claimed they were dissuaded from leaving their positions or seeking shelter by threats of termination. Last week, as collapsed houses were marked clear of victims and turned back in on themselves by bulldozers and condemned to demolition, Mayfield residents barely had time to assess the impact. The raging winds had left metal siding wrapped tight around dismembered trees, demolished the town hall Christmas tree and torn the roof off the building itself and scattered debris for miles around in a manner reminiscent of an air-crash. “It’s not normal to get a tornado in December, but then it’s not normal for it to be 73 degrees at night,” said Mayfield resident Tim Wetherbee, referring to the local temperature on the day the onslaught destroyed 15,000 buildings and trailer-homes and caused at least $3.5bn in damage. In a world that is failing to do enough to curb emissions that cause global heating and thus make extreme weather events more likely, the wider context of what happened in Mayfield was not lost on Wetherbee. “People think about today, not tomorrow, and it’s only going to get worse,” he said. His niece, Huda Alubahi, was sheltering in a bathroom closet when the tornado struck. Clutched to her side was her three-year-old son, Jha’lil, who was struck and killed as the house collapsed. His other niece and her children narrowly escaped injury when their house over the road was struck. On the other side of the post office, which lost its roof, his sister’s house was also destroyed. In all, Wetherbee, a refrigeration and heating contractor, counted five family members whose houses were destroyed. As power company workers began restoring power to Mayfieldfor some there was little to do but gawp at the scale of the destruction. Lengths of two-by-four had become airborne spears, penetrating the metal skins of cars; overturned school buses and semis; storage bins ruptured to reveal tons of grain now exposed to the elements; a collapsed water tower; and dozens of structures, from statuesque municipal buildings or private homes, that will now likely be demolished to prevent black mold from setting in. “Smaller tornadoes bounce, but an EF-4 stays on the ground,” said property owner Hoot Gibson surveying several of his ruined properties. “The only difference between this and an atom bomb is that a bomb would have fried people.” Climate change was not a subject all were willing to be drawn on. “Most people don’t want to know,” said James Hyatte, owner of The Catfish House. “They’ll go with what Fox News or their church tell them.” Joava Good, deputy director of the Church of Scientology’s disaster response team, ascribed the event to an act of “evil.” Good, who has attended the aftermath of 45 tornadoes, said that to have one of this magnitude in December was open to interpretation. “It’s quite amazing to see what’s happening. Something has changed.” Following the track of a tornado is a relatively straightforward task of following a trail of broken trees and debris. Half a mile out of town is the Mayfield Candle Factory, that had 110 workers on night shift when the storm hit. For many, it was work of last resort: poorly paid but easily accessible to those without transport. It offered consistent work, running 10-12 hour shifts around the clock at starting pay of $8 an hour to meet demand from customers like Bed, Bath & Beyond. “It’s pitiful,” said a project manager for the factory. “We lost eight lives, but we could have lost more.” The factory, reduced to a pile of twisted metal and concrete, lies a quarter mile from a feed factory that was relatively unscathed, a demolished chicken hatchery missing its chicks, likely drawn 35,000ft up into the storm; a tractor dealership that while badly damaged lost none of its equipment. Many in town, including workers at the factory that night, contradicted management’s claims that employees had been free to leave after multiple tornado warnings were issued for the area. “Even with weather like this, you’re still going to fire me?” 20-year-old worker Evan Johnson reportedly asked a manager. Their response, “Yes.” Amos Jones, an attorney representing Haley Conder, one of those trapped in the factory after it collapsed, said the candle factory, along with the partial collapse of an Amazon fulfillment center in Edwardsville that killed six, could be a turning point for labor rights. “Amid the tragedy, we hope there will be more responsible care for employees and an end to all American sweatshops,” Jones said. Jones said he he was compelled to file a workers compensation suit after a spokesman for the factory’s owner, Mayfield Consumer Products, continued to discredit and eyewitness declarations that workers were prevented from leaving and subjected to roll-calls and line-ups to determine who had left so they could be disciplined or fired. Company officials denied the allegations. The tornado also helped focus some minds on exactly who those workers were. Jaime Massó, pastor of Primera Iglesia Bautista Hispana, who had turned his small church into a outreach to supply Mayfield’s Mexican and Central American migrant worker population with food, said many workers at the factory registered under assumed names – leading to confusion over who was missing. “It’s part of the problem – they’ve been looking for the wrong people,” Massó said. “There’s a fear of authorities, and they’re not going to risk exposing themselves. They’re here, but we’ve got emergency responders searching the rubble.” Jane Hoopingarner, a crisis responder with the Red Cross, said the job for emergency workers was to start to build trust with communities that often see themselves – and are seen – as outsiders. “We are here to walk beside and support them – not provide everything they need – because they’re already being provided for by their own community.” The storm itself, though, did not discriminate. Ten miles south-west of Mayfield, Amish farms dot the landscape, and the communities’ horse-drawn buggies are a common sight on the country lanes and in town. The storm tore apart the home of Jacob and Emma Gingerich, killing both along with two of their five children. Chris Crawford, a nearby farm owner – an “Englisher” to the Amish – said he’d been over to warn the couple of the storm’s approach. “They had no way to know what was coming. We talked, they thanked me, and then 30 minutes later it came through.” Crawford went back after it had passed to find the couple’s infant baby, Ben, wearing only a diaper, under a vehicle more than 50 yards from the home and some distance from where his mother lay dead. “I heard the whimper. He was laying in the driveway. I cuddled him up, and just ask God don’t let him die on me.” Timber supplier Ronnie Murphy, helping to co-ordinate the barn rebuilds, said he believed the infant had been ripped from his mother’s arms. “All the babies that made it through are miracles, but this one…” he trailed off. By midweek, the family were buried in a single grave, and 200 of the community were coming from as far away as Canada by train to help rebuild the sawmills that had been destroyed. “I guess that’s the way God wanted it,” commented neighbor Joe Stutzman. He declined to speculate on climate-science interpretations. “We don’t get involved in stuff like that, but the end is getting closer for sure. Why did this thing come through here? I think it was to wake people up. ‘Hey! Work together better. Show your love. Pray.’” Much of the Gingrich’s farm ended up a quarter-mile away in the wood next to Joey Rogers, who lost his home, four barns, poultry and livestock. Many of his surviving cattle were still too spooked to be rounded up. “They sense the storm coming and go crazy, but there’s not much place to go when you’re out in a field,” said local vet Timothy Jones. But in the manner of natural disasters, he said, human life was first and foremost, but the animals were part of the trickle down, expansive consequences of a tornado strike. Domestic animals, too, had been injured – a dog with a splinter in his chest, another that required a leg amputated. Others, though, had been simply swept up into the story and lost for good. “How far they go, who knows?” It maybe too early to talk of recovery in Mayfield. For some, it is a going to be a haul that goes on long after the immediate dizzying intensity of the event itself and its aftermath subsides. Sandra Delk, co-ordinator for Mayfield’s community response, said she slept in her car the first two nights, then moved into a trailer with electrical issues, and finally moved back home, though still without light or heating. “People are in a daze, and some are never going to go back to their homes,” she said.",News/US news,"Tornadoes in Mayfield, Kentucky caused profound losses: ‘Some are never going back to their homes’",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/26/tornadoes-mayfield-kentucky-caused-profound-losses
12/26/2021,"Earlier this month, Kamala Harris convened the inaugural meeting of the National Space Council, an important summit that brought together cabinet secretaries and top space and military officials in the sun-drenched atrium of the US Institute of Peace. Over the course of nearly two hours, the vice-president engaged the panel in discussion with real, earthly implications for national security, the climate crisis and workforce development. But attention in Washington was diverted elsewhere. At the supreme court, the justices were weighing the future of abortion rights. Republicans in Congress were threatening a government shutdown over their opposition to Covid-19 mask mandates. And as Harris spoke, public health experts confirmed the first case of the Omicron coronavirus variant in the US.  Such is the challenge of Harris’s mission: a historic first navigating an inescapably secondary role. Her work on the president’s most urgent priorities – combatting the coronavirus pandemic and enacting his legislative agenda – is often overlooked, while her efforts on her own policy portfolio often goes unnoticed. It is a dynamic that has frustrated past occupants of the office, which comes with great influence but few formal responsibilities. But the expectations – and the stakes – are even higher for Harris, both because she made history as the first Black, South Asian and female vice-president, and because she is next in line to Joe Biden, who, at 79, is the oldest president ever to hold office. Speaking to the space council, Harris shared a piece of wisdom given to her by an astronaut, offering it as a guiding principle for tackling the myriad challenges before them: “Just focus on what’s right in front of you. And from there, widen your view.” Nearly a year into her vice-presidency, Harris has plenty to focus on – and more than enough distractions. Harris has been handed a portfolio packed with politically thorny issues, voting rights and the root causes of immigration from Central America, among them. That work comes in addition to a host of other assignments that includes selling the president’s infrastructure plan, advocating for his sprawling social policy bill, representing women in the workforce, highlighting maternal health disparities, combatting vaccine hesitancy and championing small businesses. The Biden administration continues to face a global pandemic that has not receded, rising inflation and uncertainty over the centerpiece of the president’s legislative agenda. Since taking office, her approval numbers have fallen precipitously alongside Biden’s, fueling early chatter about possible Democratic alternatives should Biden not run for re-election in 2024. She is a frequent target of attacks from conservative media outlets, where some pundits still willfully mispronounce her first name. But she has also come under pressure from activists frustrated by the slow pace of progress on issues like immigration and voting rights. And the recent departures of high-profile aides from her office have renewed scrutiny of her management style. In the churn, Harris has struggled to chart her own course in a position that can be simultaneously forgettable and highly visible. “When you are second in command, not first in command, no one understands your role,” said Donna Brazile, a veteran Democratic strategist who is close to Harris. “So you have to constantly define your role and shape your own narrative. That is the challenge that she has.” The pandemic, and the possibility of being summoned to cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate, have made travel tricky. But Harris said recently she hopes to spend more time away from Washington next year, selling the president’s agenda. And she will surely be a sought-after surrogate for Democrats on the campaign trail ahead of November’s midterm elections. Already, Harris has made dozens of domestic trips, hosting roundtables and giving local interviews to spotlight the administration’s work. On recent trip to Charlotte to promote the infrastructure law, Harris was joined by the transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg. During a tour of a bus depot, Harris sought to keep the focus on infrastructure, quizzing a local transit official about the features of a brand-new electric-powered bus. But after the event, Harris was peppered with questions from reporters about 2024, the rumored rivalry between her and Buttigieg and reports of a “staff shake-up” in the vice-president’s office. Harris has expressed frustration with the breathless coverage, which includes a recent report on her skepticism of Bluetooth headphones and an interview with a body-language expert analyzing her interactions with Buttigieg during the North Carolina trip. In an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, Harris called the coverage “ridiculous” and said she would not allow herself to be distracted. “There is no playbook for this,” said Karen Finney, a longtime Democratic strategist who is close to the Harris team. Noting that Harris has broken barriers in every job she’s held, Finney said she came into office with her eyes wide open. “She’s tough,” Finney said. “She’s focused on the job.” Some stories are harder to dismiss. Stories about staff dysfunction have dogged Harris throughout her nearly two decades in elected office, from San Francisco district attorney to the US Senate to her 2020 presidential campaign, which fell apart amid reports of internal discord. Allies see overtones of sexism and racism in the coverage of Harris. They say the portrait of her as an overbearing boss is a trope used to diminish women in politics, and that male politicians are rarely subject to the same level of scrutiny over their leadership style. And former aides have come to her defense, saying she is demanding but not unfair. But critics say Harris stands apart. She burns through staffers who have a high tolerance for difficult work environments under both male and female bosses. They point to the high turnover in her office and the lack of longtime aides by her side, a sharp contrast with Biden, who is surrounded by advisers who have been with him for decades. Gil Duran, a columnist for the San Francisco Examiner, worked for Harris in 2013, when she was attorney general. He left five months later. In a recent column, he wrote that Harris was repeating the “same old destructive patterns”. Those concerns did little to slow her political rise, Duran told the Guardian, but now that she is seen as Biden’s heir apparent, they could color perceptions of her ability to manage the presidency. “It’s important to put a stop to this narrative,” he said. If she can do that, he believes the stories of internal dysfunction will be “old news” by the time she might face voters again. “But if it continues to be refreshed by new drama,” Duran warned, “then I think it’s going to be hard to escape.” Harris’s difficult portfolio has caused angst among supporters and allies who hope to see her rise to the presidency. Some have argued that tasking the vice president with politically sensitive – and potentially intractable – policy issues positions her poorly for future endeavors. Others have argued she is being sidelined in her current role, left to handle matters that are either unpleasant or peripheral to the administration’s priorities. When asked by ABC’s George Stephanopoulos if she felt “misused or underused” by the White House, Harris disagreed. “No,” she said. “I don’t. I’m very, very excited about the work that we have accomplished.” Elaine Kamarck, a senior research fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of Picking the Vice President, says the concern is misguided. “The measure of a successful vice-president is whether or not the president trusts them enough to give them major duties,” she said. “That she has been given important jobs by the president means that he trusts her. And of course, they’re tough. If they weren’t tough, they wouldn’t be important.” But she has also frustrated immigration advocates and progressives, who consider the California Democrat, herself the daughter of immigrants, as a close ally. Many were upset that she used her first international trip to Central America to warn migrants: “Do not come.” They are also disappointed by the slow pace of progress on the administration’s long-promised immigration reform. For several days, immigrant rights activists protested outside Harris’s residence at the Naval Observatory, demanding the administration make good on their promise to deliver pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants. Harris has stressed that progress will be slow. Combating corruption and violence in Central America, not to mention addressing the threat of climate change, will take years to bear fruit. But she has made some headway. Harris recently announced a slew of new pledges from companies like ​​PepsiCo, Mastercard and Microsoft, as part of her efforts to improve economic opportunity in the region. Perhaps no issue in her charge is of more urgent concern for her party than voting rights. It is a task even Biden conceded would take “a hell of a lot of work”, but one that has personal resonance for Harris, who likes to say that she attended civil rights protests as a child, when she was still in a stroller. Activists have spent months pressuring Biden and Harris to use their bully pulpit more aggressively to push for voting rights legislation. A pair of voting rights bills are stalled in the Senate, where Republicans have used the filibuster to block the measures on four separate occasions. A recent meeting with Harris left leading voting rights advocates frustrated and alarmed that the White House did not have a strategy to pass federal voting rights legislation as Republicans roll back access to the ballot box in state legislatures across the country and enact new electoral maps designed to benefit them politically. “We need to see that sense of urgency as they have done with other priorities in administration,” said Melanie Campbell, president and CEO of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation. “We’ve not seen that level of urgency yet.” One of the few concrete duties the Constitution provides for the vice president is to serve as president of the Senate, casting tie-breaking votes when they arise. It’s a job that keeps her busy – and nearby – as she can be summoned to Capitol Hill at any hour of the day to push legislation or one of the president’s nominee through the evenly divided chamber. “Every time I vote, we win,” Harris told NBC News after casting her 14th and 15th tie-breaking votes. Despite her time on Capitol Hill, she has not served as the administration’s lead negotiator on its legislative agenda, a role Biden relished as Barack Obama’s vice-president. Harris, who spent a large part of her nearly four years in the Senate running for president, lacks the deep bonds Biden forged with lawmakers over his decades in Congress. But Harris has worked to strengthen those relationships with her former colleagues. Earlier this year, she invited all 24 female senators for dinner at her residence. And during the fraught, final negotiations over the infrastructure law, she huddled with Biden at the White House, making late-night calls to members of Congress that helped seal the deal. Carving her own path, Harris has sought to use her ceremonial office to elevate issues and voices that are often underrepresented in Washington. Earlier this year, she met with disability advocates to discuss how the administration could make voting more accessible. She also recently convened the first White House’s first day of action on maternal health. During the summit, she highlighted the racial disparities in the nation’s maternal mortality rate, which is more than double that of most other developed nations. “I wonder what my mother would say today, had she been here to see this, or my grandmother or any other woman from that era, including Shirley Chisholm, who I had the great opportunity to work for,” Brazile, who was the first Black woman to manage a presidential campaign, said, becoming emotional. “What would they say if they got up every morning knowing that the person who is a heartbeat away from the presidency, the person who is second in command, is someone who looks like them?” On 19 November, Harris became the first woman in American history to hold presidential powers. The brief transfer of power occurred from 10:10 am to 11:35 am EST, while Biden was under anesthesia for a routine colonoscopy. Harris spent the time working from her office in the West Wing and most would agree her stint in the role of president left the glass ceiling largely intact. Yet for her supporters, the moment was a glimpse of a future they still believe to be possible. History has shown that the best path forward for a vice president with higher ambitions is to ensure the success of the president, said Kamarck. “In the end, what matters is whether people end up liking the Biden years,” Kamarck said. “Do they want it to continue or are they sick of the Biden years and want something different?”",News/US news,Harris charts her own course as vice-president amid intense scrutiny,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/26/kamala-harris-vice-president-first-year-scrutiny-joe-biden

12/26/2021,"Maxine Peake remembers the day she got the call from her agent. “He said: ‘A script has come in. It’s about Anne Williams, the Hillsborough campaigner, and… ’ and straight away,” Peake says, “I got in there and said: ‘Yes!’ My agent said: ‘Don’t you want to read it first?’ I said: ‘Oh, all right, then… Can’t we just get cracking on it?’” Peake had seen Anne Williams on the news, campaigning for justice for her teenage son Kevin, who died at the Hillsborough football stadium disaster in 1989. But she never met Anne, who died in 2013. Soon, the doubts set in. “I sat back and thought: ‘Can I play her? I don’t look like her, I don’t sound like her, Anne’s a mother…’ [As an actor] you think of all the things that you’re not. But then I just thought: ‘This is not about me, it’s about telling a story. It’s about the privilege of being a part of something like this.’”  It’s early December, and Peake, her co-star Stephen Walters and scriptwriter Kevin Sampson are talking to me via Zoom about Anne, ITV’s new dramatisation of the life of Anne Williams, a shopkeeper from Formby who spent 20 years battling the Hillsborough cover-up and grew into one of the most inspirational justice campaigners of the late 20th century. Anne airs over four consecutive nights in January, a drama that spans 24 years, from 15 April 1989 to Williams’s premature death from cancer in 2013. It’s a powerful portrait of an unassuming mother and her fight for the truth – and the toll it took on her family and her health. Made by World Productions, the team behind Line of Duty, Vigil and The Pembrokeshire Murders, Anne was written and conceived by Sampson, an author and Liverpool fan who survived the crush outside the Leppings Lane end at Hillsborough, then witnessed the tragedy unfold inside. At the heart of his adaptation is what Sampson rightly describes as a “phenomenal” performance by Peake. “It’s one of the reasons I do what I do, to be involved in projects like this,” Peake tells me. “I had so many actors calling me, saying: ‘Can you get me a scene in this?’ Actors who would never normally do this.” Anne begins with 15-year-old Kevin Williams waking up on a sunny spring day in 1989 to his mum telling him that he can go to the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest after all, and follows her through the two decades during which she confronted police lies, political corruption and a sneering judiciary to secure the rightful inquest verdict into how he died at the match. Much of Anne is painful to watch – some scenes will have viewers shouting at their screens in frustration – but it’s subtle, too; an inspiring story about a mother’s love for her family, and how goodness can endure in people exposed even to the most cynical power in the land. “It’s deeply harrowing in parts,” Sampson says. “But it has to be that way. When I first mentioned the idea of doing a film to Anne [back in 2012, when Sampson was writing the book Hillsborough Voices] I told her that compared to what she had been through, Erin Brockovich was light entertainment.” Kevin was crushed to death in pen 3 at Hillsborough: one of 37 teenagers among the 97 men, women and children killed by catastrophic police negligence. In episode one, Peake plays Anne in the first year of her bereavement; poleaxed by grief, buried under the bedsheets, pushed from pillar to post simply trying to establish what happened to Kevin in his final moments. Anne initially believes the official line that Kevin died rapidly, of compression asphyxia – that there had been no chance of him being saved once severe neck injuries were inflicted. While at first she takes some solace in the belief his death was instantaneous, by the second episode, in 1990, cracks are starting to appear in the official narrative. As Anne begins to piece together the truth, with the help of lawyers, medical experts and two police officers who refuse to toe the line, Kevin’s death emerges as one of the keys to a cover-up. At the original Hillsborough inquests in 1990-91, the coroner, Stefan Popper, imposed the infamous “3.15 cut-off”: essentially, Popper ruled that all those who died had received fatal injuries that were irreversible by 3.15pm. Thus there was no need to hear evidence into the emergency services’ response beyond that time. In 1990, Popper’s ruling was largely taken at face value. But over the four episodes of Anne, which follow her campaign from 1990 to 2012, it becomes evident that the South Yorkshire coroner’s ruling meant the full extent of the South Yorkshire Police negligence at Hillsborough, under Chief Supt David Duckenfield, was never scrutinised in Sheffield Town Hall. It took the Hillsborough Independent Panel’s landmark report, in 2012, to establish that if there had been a properly coordinated emergency response, Kevin – and 40 others who died that day – might have been saved after 3.15pm. The wider truth was not, initially, Anne’s concern; she simply wanted to know what happened to “my little boy”. “So many of the campaigners were heartbroken mums in search of answers,” says Sampson, “and the idea of a mother’s love as the most potent adversary to corruption is a powerful one. It’s also completely relatable.” The relatability is also there in the depiction of a family breaking down in their grief, and their need for truth. While Anne and her indefatigable ally Sheila Coleman, a researcher from Liverpool city council, become amateur sleuths (“They used to describe themselves as Cagney and Lacey,” Sampson says), Anne’s husband, Steve, pleads with her not to describe Kevin’s fatal injuries to their elder son over tea, despairs over family holidays ruined, and looks on hopelessly as his wife drifts away, physically and emotionally. As Steve begins to realise family life will never be the same again, he retreats into the garden shed with his record player. One night, as Anne is drinking in a Kilburn pub after an encounter with the high court, Steve packs up his record collection and moves on. As Sampson says: “For Anne and all these bereaved mums, their job description changed, unbidden, overnight. When they woke up on that Sunday in April 1989 they were truth-seekers and detectives and campaigners. Viewers will, I think, empathise with that – seeing the little people rise up in adversity to become mighty.” When he first mooted the idea of adapting her story in 2012, Sampson was losing his own mother. “I felt inspired to write about these doughty mums, rolling up their sleeves.” Among all the bereaved Hillsborough mothers, why Anne? “Of all the people I’ve met, she was the one who best embodied the humility, the determination and the humour,” he says. “Anne embodied the universality of the Hillsborough experience.” Anne was a friend of mine. I survived the crush in pen 3 that killed Kevin, and in 2009, on the eve of the 20th anniversary of the disaster, with the cover-up stretching endlessly ahead, I wrote a story for the Observer about my experience of surviving Hillsborough, and how others had been affected – including Anne. We became friends, as Anne did with so many survivors. I tell Peake that her performance is remarkable – all the more so for the fact that she never met Anne. She smiles, sweetly. “Ah, thank you. You can’t help but go out with your fingers crossed that people see some resemblance to Anne, and who she was.” What did she draw on? “As an actor, you’ve got your instinct and your empathy. I also read Phil Scraton’s book Hillsborough: The Truth, Kevin’s Hillsborough Voices, I watched archive news footage, and met [Anne’s daughter] Sara. But at the end of the day, you go with the words on the page.” Sampson’s script is subtle and, for all its pain, free of sentimentality – something that appealed to Peake. “Right at the start,” she says, “I said to [the director] Bruce Goodison: ‘I don’t want this to be too sentimental. I don’t want Anne to be in tears all the time… ’ Anne reminded me of my mum: that generation of understated, quiet women who weren’t political but had a strong sense of justice.” Peake lost her mum to pancreatic cancer at 66, six months after she was diagnosed. “I saw her cry [only] once,” she says. “Those women didn’t… You see lots of dramas now and everybody’s always crying! And I actually think it takes a lot for real people to cry. We cry at not the most tragic things, sometimes. It’s always surprising, people’s reaction to trauma.” Anne is indeed a story of trauma, of what Sampson describes as the “collateral damage of Hillsborough”, but it’s a story in which hope endures. It’s there in what Peake describes as “such a beautiful relationship between Anne and her husband, Steve”, played by Stephen Walters (Outlander, Little Boy Blue) in his first role since a stellar performance in season four of Shetland as released murderer Thomas Malone. Walters had the benefit of being able to meet the inspiration for his character. Steve Williams had become a virtual recluse; content just left alone with his music. To Sara’s surprise, her dad invited Walters to his home. “It was the guitar, and music, that we bonded over,” Walters says. “Just talking for an hour about blues records. I had a go at his guitar – his hands are not so good now, but you could tell he was a player, and I play too. And it helped; he was really open. He said: ‘Ask me anything.’” As filming progressed, Walters would listen to Van Morrison’s Into the Mystic “every morning, and evening, as that was Steve and Anne’s song”. And he would text Steve for insights into how he reacted to certain events. “These are things that inform a role, things you could never get from a book,” Walters says. For Sampson, an Anfield season ticket holder who has lived with Hillsborough since day one, there was “a huge burden of responsibility” in writing the screenplay. “Our country has, in the main, looked the other way while this abhorrent abuse of the most basic human rights has gnawed away at these people, over decades, in plain sight,” he says. “And you don’t want people to look away. Too many people think that those touched by the disaster should put it behind them. I think those people need to know a bit more about why it’s so hard to do that – and the telling of that is quite tough.” As a survivor, I can see where one or two punches may have been pulled. “I consulted with Anne’s family at every step,” Sampson says, “and if we felt that something was too close to the bone, we’d pull back.” And yet, frequently, there are moments so moving that the use of archive footage from the day of the disaster comes as something of a relief. Peake and Walters are compelling; spinning round each other in their grief like two dancers in the dark. And at about 9.45pm on 3 January, when the second episode airs, I won’t be surprised to hear the cry of millions across the country: “But there’s an ambulance right there, on their own fucking videotape!” Was it draining for Peake and Walters, playing Anne and Steve? “No, I find it quite energising when you get to play people like these,” Peake says. “We had the most fantastic conversations with people around the campaign. They were so human, and full of humanity. People like Bishop James [Jones, chair of the Hillsborough Independent Panel] spoke about his spiritualism, and Anne’s spiritualism. And I came away thinking: ‘Wow!’” Peake describes herself as “a card-carrying atheist”. But sometimes, “maybe there are other elements. Back in the day, actors were shamans, weren’t they… Maybe you get help from other places.” Walters agrees. “I do believe [in God]. I remember having these philosophical discussions with Maxine about life… and, again, that feeds the work.” The scripts took Sampson a year to write, and the entire four hours of drama was shot in just nine weeks. “Bruce [the director] got us together three or four days before we started principal photography, and we went over all of the scenes between Steve and Anne, and that wedded us in,” Walters says. “And we hooked up together for a night in Wales before filming the first scene, and just talked. It cemented something before we actually started. There was a sense of us together. It’s not always that a director does this,” he says. It was a clever approach, given the tight schedule. Peake might be playing Anne in her 30s one morning, then Anne in her 50s that afternoon, and as she wrapped the morning’s shoot she’d be told: “You’re 20 years older after lunch, Maxine.” Throughout, her ability to capture Anne’s mannerisms, her compassion, her resolve, is extraordinary. Anne’s daughter, Sara, said: “When I first heard that Maxine would play my mum, I thought: ‘Well, she looks a bit like her. But by the end, I felt like I was watching my mum.” For Peake “it was never conscious. I didn’t watch Anne and go: ‘Oh, these are her mannerisms, I must do those.’ But Anne had a slower rhythm than me, so it was about slowing things down. You have to check yourself sometimes. I would have to say to myself: ‘You’re not feeling sorry for Anne, you are playing Anne.’ You have to navigate your emotions sometimes: it’s a case of ‘Am I in the moment, as Anne, or is this me going ‘This is overwhelming’?” Scenes shot on the beach at Formby allow for some of the air we all needed to breathe – Anne as she refuses to buckle under her suffocating anguish; the survivors, her allies, struggling with PTSD. There is humour, in parts. But this is essentially a love story, of a mother’s devotion to her family. It is also a tribute to Anne’s unyielding faith in the goodness of people. In episode one, she is moved by the generosity of a farmer outside Sheffield the morning after the disaster, who refuels their empty petrol tank as she and Steve head into the city to find Kevin. “Most people are good, Anne,” Steve says, as they set off towards Hillsborough, and into a 24-year ordeal. Anne’s faith in the good endures the carnival of corruption ahead, even if her marriage can’t. By the end of episode four, we see her at the Royal Courts of Justice on the Strand in London, in 2012, to see the lord chief justice quash the original Hillsborough inquest verdicts of accidental death – effectively, Anne’s dying wish. While physically diminished by cancer, she appears a giant of a justice seeker. As the final credits remind us, no one has served a moment’s jail time for unlawfully killing Kevin and 96 other people at Hillsborough. And yet the truth that Anne Williams helped to establish has become something purer, more enduring than the “justice” delivered by a legal system that became transparent only in its unwillingness to hold the guilty to account. “Anne was always able to find hope,” says Sampson. “She believed that most people were good, and that the truth would, eventually, out. She was right. That basic belief in the power of truth is Anne’s legacy, and it is, for many of us, the ultimate verdict on Hillsborough. The establishment lied. The ordinary people told the truth.”  Anne is on ITV on 2 January  The documentary The Real Anne: Unfinished Business starts on ITV on 2 January And the Sun Shines Now: How Hillsborough and the Premier League Changed Britain by Adrian Tempany was shortlisted for the Orwell prize",Arts/Television & radio,Maxine Peake on Hillsborough drama Anne: ‘It’s a privilege to be a part of something like this’,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/26/maxine-peake-anne-williams-hillsborough-drama-itv-interview
12/26/2021,"Even before summer heatwaves sent temperatures soaring across the west, lakebeds had already begun ceding ground to the cracked, dried earth. Rings showed around reservoirs where water levels fell to historic lows, verdant hillsides took on brown hues, and trees became tinder in forests primed to burn. The conditions fueled unstoppable fires that grew large and ferocious enough to create their own weather patterns.But along with the desiccation, there were downpours. Even as states grappled with the effects of a devastating drought, storms delivered heavy rains that caused floods and damaging debris flows.  In the American west it was a year of extremes. Scientists say it is likely just a taste of what’s to come if the climate crisis continues on its current course. “We have known this for a while,” said Steve Ostoja, director of the USDA California Climate Hub. “The question is how extreme is this going to go? What is the ceiling and what is the floor?” Houseboats sit in a narrow section of water in a depleted Lake Oroville. Kamala Harris tours Lake Mead in Nevada in October. As of early December, roughly 80% of the American west was still experiencing “severe drought” as categorized by the US Drought Monitor. Nearly half still qualifies for the “extreme drought” category. The critically dry conditions left some communities with water shortages, fields were left to fallow, and reservoir storage in California – which has been among the states hardest hit by the catastrophe – fell to 60% of average. This year, Lake Mead, which straddles Nevada and Arizona and is the largest reservoir in the country, sank to record-low levels and for the first time ever, and a water allocation shortage was declared for the Colorado River, which provides water for numerous western states and Mexico. All of California remains under a statewide drought emergency and the state’s governor, Gavin Newsom, has called on residents to reduce water-use by 15%. “This is without precedent,” Newsom said at a news conference announcing the first two drought declarations in April, standing on the dried and cracked ground once covered by the waters of Lake Mendocino. “Oftentimes we overstate the word historic, but this is indeed an historic moment.” The ebbs and flows of precipitation are normal in most western climates, especially in California. But human-caused warming has changed the stakes and added compounding characteristics. Rising temperatures limit the snowpack and also speed evaporation out of parched environments. That’s why, scientists fear, this isn’t just a disaster but a troubling trend. “The drought in the American west is not a passing crisis,” Justin Mankin, a climate scientist and co-lead of the NOAA Drought Task Force wrote in a Washington Post op-ed in September. “It is the shape of things to come.” A kayaker paddles in Lake Oroville in August as water levels remain low. Empty boat slips sit on a dry lake bed at Folsom Lake Marina in May. Rows of almond trees sit on the ground during an orchard removal project in Snelling, California in May. High temperatures and drought also set the stage for intense and difficult-to-contain wildfires, which blackened more than 7.6 million acres across the US in 2021. Ancient trees and mountain towns were consumed by the fast-moving flames that spewed embers miles into the distance. The infernos grew large and violent enough to force thousands to flee their homes. “This year’s fire season in the western US, and especially in three west-coast states, was the second exceptional wildfire year in a row” says Park Williams, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. He cited the extreme drought and heat-wave events “which dried out fuels and made it easy for fires to escape our control in dense forested areas”.

The Caldor fire approaches South Lake Tahoe in August. Record-breaking heatwaves – hot enough to cook small sea creatures alive along the shores of the Pacific north-west this summer – wreaked havoc on residents, agriculture, and infrastructure. Hundreds of people perished during the dangerously-high temperatures. Across the US, 18% of the country broke heat records and summer temperatures were 2.6F above average, according to Noaa. Climate models indicate that these extreme events could become more common by mid-century and there could be up to 30 big heatwaves a year. The norm now is between four and six. “That’s a huge difference,” Ostoja said. “That basically means it is going to be that hot all the time.” They are also expected grow in size, impacting more people and places, according to research from Bradfield Lyon, a professor at the Climate Change Institute at the University of Maine. “By mid-century, the spacial size of heatwaves in the US are expected to increase between about 50% to 80% from what they are in the current climate,” he said. “The frequency will increase, the duration will increase, as well as the intensity.” A thermometer at Badwater Basin in Death Valley national park in July.

A dead chinook salmon floats in a fish trap on the lower Klamath River in Weitchpec, California, in June. While much of the west remained mired in drought through the autumn, some areas of the southwest, including Arizona and New Mexico, were drenched between June and September. The heavy rains tampered fire threats but also caused deadly flash floods and debris flows. The Pacific north-west was also pummeled by downpours. Residents in western Canada and Washington state had to leave their homes as the waters rose. Water treatment facilities became overwhelmed in the city of Merritt in British Columbia, where officials called for evacuations due to “risk of mass sewage back-up and personal health risk”. The warnings came mere months after the last evacuations issued during the summer as wildfires laid siege on nearby towns. The province also endured punishing heatwaves that broke records and claimed hundreds of lives across the region. Northern California was also hit hard by two rain storms that both left behind submerged streets, downed trees and power lines, and crumbling hillsides. Evacuations were ordered near burn scars from recent years where the danger of debris flows was high. Unhoused residents bore the brunt, as tents and shelters were overcome by the rains.

The extreme events that defined 2021 were destructive and devastating – but scientists hope they serve as warnings against a future that can still be avoided. Ostoja, from the USDA, likened humanity’s approach to climate change as a frog sitting in water that’s slowly starting to boil. But when disasters strike, it’s more difficult to look away. “At least the extreme events kick that a little,” he says, “and my hope is that that’s what we start paying attention.”",News/US news,A year of extreme weather in the American west – in pictures,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/26/american-west-extreme-weather-climate-crisis-in-pictures
12/26/2021,"The space between Christmas and New Year is normally treated as pretty sacred in political circles. There are a few modest pre-prepared government and opposition announcements to keep journalists in business while everyone else switches off and remembers what their families look like. Not so this year. In the next few days, there will most likely be a cabinet meeting, albeit one on Zoom, to discuss whether England needs more restrictions to stop the spread of Omicron. After nearly two years of Zoom meetings, everyone is well aware of how hard it is to read the mood of a group of people through a computer screen. Some of Boris Johnson’s problems with his party have stemmed from the lack of real contact between the prime minister and MPs. It hasn’t helped that the internet in Downing Street is about as reliable as Johnson’s commitment to being straight with people. But even when the wifi signal is strong, the prime minister has failed to read the virtual room and has often ploughed ahead with jokes and upbeat speeches while his colleagues stare disconsolately at their screens.  But Johnson can’t have failed to notice that the mood on his cabinet calls is now very different to just a couple of months ago. It’s not the internet connection that’s breaking up, but his relationships with his own ministers, some of whom used to be very happy to support and cheer him along. Now the mood has soured. The next Zoom will be a tense affair and not just because there is a split in the PM’s top team over whether to shut down more parts of society again to keep Omicron under control. His own authority is in question, too. Last week’s cabinet call felt different partly because of the conspicuous absence of Lord Frost, who had sensationally resigned over the weekend. It also, according to those taking part, was mildly unsettling because Johnson wanted to hear what they thought and didn’t seem confident about making a decision. The ministers most sceptical about the wisdom of more restrictions also felt safe enough to push Johnson on whether he had enough data and whether the modelling on how infections might spread was right. Not only is the prime minister weak after months of political mistakes and the biggest Commons revolt of his leadership on vaccine passports, but cabinet ministers are also aware that their colleagues on the backbenches want them to be more challenging so that there aren’t further mistakes in the new year. It is no coincidence that two of the most outspoken ministers against early restrictions last week were also the two most prominent leadership contenders: Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak. Both have been busily courting backbenchers as they start to build their own campaigns for the top job. All this canvassing work means they’ve got a much better grasp of how Tory MPs are feeling than Johnson does. They know there is a growing anxiety that the Conservative party is becoming what one senior Tory warns is a “patrician Covid-state party” that signs off more curbs on people’s freedom, partly out of fear that it could knock over the fragile NHS at any moment. Sunak has the added frustration of having to find more and more funding for the health service while the businesses whose activities end up funding the NHS through taxation keep struggling because of the ongoing uncertainty and on-and-off nature of restrictions. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, has similar concerns and has been increasingly resistant to more curbs. He and his junior ministers have often overstepped the government line in media interviews to try to push policy in their direction. There are now few consequences for going against the agreed line, not least because there isn’t always a line to break. Mind you, recently it has been a miracle that any minister agrees to go out and do media at all. On some of the worst days of the rows about Downing Street Christmas parties, the cabinet were nowhere to be seen. It wasn’t just the indefensible behaviour at the heart of the stories, but also that Johnson has squandered a great deal of loyalty among his ministers over the preceding months. Take Grant Shapps. He has long been known as someone who would happily go on to any broadcast outlet and bat for the government, but allies of the normally Tiggerish transport secretary say he’s felt badly burned recently by the way Downing Street managed to botch the briefing of the government’s integrated rail plan so that a £96bn programme of upgrades ended up sounding like swingeing cuts to the railways. Chief whip Mark Spencer isn’t at all visible in the media but his efforts to defend the prime minister to the rest of the party have gone without any real thanks. Indeed, Johnson has left Spencer feeling humiliated in recent months by making him sack a junior ministerial aide, Angela Richardson, over her refusal to support his attempt to overhaul the parliamentary standards regime and help Owen Paterson escape his punishment for breaking lobbying rules. Spencer then had the grim task of reinstating Richardson 24 hours later. “Boris shot Mark in the head,” says one pal of Spencer’s. “The chief backed him all the way through the leadership. All the way.” Last week, Spencer saw more Downing Street briefings against him, as Johnson still blames the chief whip for persuading him to try to get Paterson off the hook in the first place. Other MPs point out that Johnson can’t blame Spencer for his own failure to read the “absolutely damning” report about Paterson. But there is little trust or affection between the prime minister and the man who is supposed to be his top enforcer. Jacob Rees-Mogg is another recipient of hostile briefings from No 10. He could leave the cabinet in a mini-reshuffle in the new year, but that’s only if things go to plan for Johnson. Currently, the bigger risk is that the leader of the House resigns before then, having also been made to look a fool during the Paterson row and now anxious about Covid restrictions. Other ministers who aren’t going anywhere are nonetheless frustrated that they’ve had to go out and clarify things that their prime minister, who is supposed to be a natural communicator, has made a mess of. A number of them had to dampen down a furious row in the party sparked by Johnson thinking aloud about a “national conversation” about mandatory vaccinations. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, was the one who managed to stop a backbench explosion by ruling out this policy, but it left many middle-of-the-road Conservatives wondering what was going on if the prime minister had to rely on Javid, quite a dry character, to clarify his words. Johnson does have a few genuine loyalists left at his top table: the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, is the fiercest among them and was recently booted out of a WhatsApp group with fellow Tory MPs for telling her colleagues to give the PM more credit. But even those who are quite comfortable with more Covid restrictions are still milking their leader’s current weakness. The levelling-up secretary, Michael Gove, has been in a stand-off with Sunak over the amount of money he wants to commit to infrastructure, housing and other projects in the north and Midlands. But colleagues also suspect he has delayed his big levelling-up white paper partly because he knows that waiting a little longer will mean the prime minister is weaker and will have to give in to more of his demands. Of course, ministers always try to play games to get their way. But normally the Downing Street operation is strong and effective enough to spot these sorts of tactics and deal with them. The risk at the moment is that Johnson is so weak and distracted that he and his team don’t realise how many colleagues aren’t really on his side any more – and then don’t have the wherewithal to do anything about it. An aggravating factor in all this is that the Labour party is now starting to make more of an impression, having been on mute for months. Keir Starmer’s new-look shadow cabinet is louder, more professional and quicker to respond to ministerial counterparts. Johnson doesn’t have as much room to mess up as he did a few months ago. But the bulk of the pressure is coming from within his cabinet. And even when they are all back together around their traditional boat-shaped table in Downing Street, proceedings will be awkward until Johnson works out how to fix his broken connection.

12/26/2021,"Back in the mid-90s, David Cronenberg’s Crash – a film about auto-eroticism adapted from JG Ballard’s 1973 novel – became a scandalous Cannes festival cause celebre when jury president Francis Ford Coppola reportedly campaigned against it winning the Palme d’Or (instead, it received a “special jury prize”). Here in the UK, the Evening Standard labelled Crash “beyond the bounds of depravity”, while the Daily Mail called for a ban – a call answered within the hallowed borough of Westminster. How delicious, then, that a quarter of a century later, the French film-maker Julia Ducournau – who made a Cannes splash with her 2016 feature debut, Raw – should take the Palme d’Or with a film that owes a striking debt to Cronenberg’s body-horror back catalogue in general, and Crash in particular. As with all full-blooded genre movies, there’s little mileage in describing Titane in terms of plot. Like Cronenberg’s The Brood, this is an adult fairytale (rated 18 for “strong violence, horror, sex”) about love, rage and loneliness, that operates on a visceral level, employing outlandish physical metaphors to describe down-to-earth emotional truths. Suffice to say that the story centres on Alexia (the remarkable Agathe Rousselle), a young woman with titanium plates in her head after a car accident as a child. It’s a trauma (her father’s fault?) to which she compulsively returns, earning a living as an exotic dancer at car shows, simulating erotic encounters with metal and glass.  There’s a car-crash quality to her relationships too – turbocharged encounters with men and women alike that breathe new meaning into the phrase la petite mort. Only a fantastical bump-and-grind with an automobile offers an emotional gear change, achieving the ecstatic highs that Alexia lacks elsewhere. So far, so twisted. But after an orgy of carnage, Alexia needs to disappear. So she cuts her hair, breaks her nose, binds her breasts and strangely distended stomach, torches her home, and adopts the identity of Adrien, who disappeared as a young boy many years ago. There are narrative echoes of films such as Daniel Vigne’s The Return of Martin Guerre (1982) or Clint Eastwood’s Changeling (2008) in what follows, as bereaved fire chief Vincent (a transformative turn from Vincent Lindon) simply accepts this unspeaking stranger as his son, and insists that his colleagues do the same. “Anyone hurts you, I’ll kill ’em,” he tells “Adrien”. “Even if it’s me. I’d kill myself, I swear.” Ducournau has described Titane as an attempt to talk about love without words, so it’s significant that dance plays an important role. From the commodified exhibition of Alexia’s car-show routine to the tragicomic sight of Vincent trying to win Adrien’s confidence by flailing around to the Zombies hit She’s Not There (title pun surely intended), movement and physicality speak volumes. Indeed, for all its onscreen metamorphoses and extreme-cinema revelations, it’s the sight of Rousselle androgynously gyrating to Wayfaring Stranger that offers the film’s most startling moment – taking us right back to the opening scene, reminding us just how far we have travelled. There’s a neat symmetry between the changing bodies of Alexia and Vincent, both of whom habitually gaze at their own reflections as they struggle to control their corporeal selves. While Alexia wraps her rebellious flesh in bandages, Vincent self-medicates with injections, raging against old age. Both inhabit bodies that refuse to behave; both have intense emotional needs they cannot contain. It’s easy to become dazzled by the headline-grabbing car-sex set pieces and Tetsuo-style flesh-and-metal mutations of Titane. Yet unlike Zoé Wittock’s 2020 gem Jumbo, for example, in which Noémie Merlant has a passionate relationship with a fairground ride, this is not a film about “mechanophilia”. On the contrary, it’s a fable that uses the lexicon of horror (serial killings, bodily eruptions, transposed identities) to get under the skin of unconditional love – just as Raw used cannibalism to discuss family bonds and coming-of-age traumas. Some will be repelled, many will be bamboozled. But for those with an appetite for cinema that gets you in the gut, Ducournau delivers the goods, superbly aided by Raw cinematographer Ruben Impens’s glowing visuals, all underpinned by a soundscape that throbs and groans like a beating celluloid heart.",Arts/Film,Titane review – Agathe Rousselle is extraordinary in Palme d’Or-winning body horror,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/26/titane-review-julia-ducournau-palme-dor-cronenberg-agathe-rousselle
12/26/2021,"Would Donald Trump make a good pantomime dame? His orange face, crazy talk, weird hair and baggy, saggy outfits are a natural fit for Mother Goose or Widow Twankey. Choleric, chaotic, always changeable, Trump might find cross-dressing a challenge. Then again, maybe not. The future role of America’s “very stable genius” is but one of many dramatic questions marking the end of a grim year when politics frequently descended into dark farce. World leaders too often served up political pantomime, not serious, sensible statecraft. You had to laugh, or else you’d cry.  Pantomimes – theatrical entertainments based on folk stories and fairytales that feature clownish caricatures, old songs and corny gags, slapstick comedy, saucy innuendo and a degree of gender switching – have their roots in Italian commedia dell’arte. They offer light relief, distraction and a chance to poke fun at the powerful. Characters such as Harlequin, Scaramouche, Pierrot and Pantaloon were transmogrified on the 19th- century English and American stage into dashing heroes and soppy heroines, despicable villains, incorrigible scallywags, feeble fops and hilarious fools. All are lampooned and ridiculed, often with satirical intent. Modern pantos remain highly popular – and Boxing Day is traditionally the moment when the curtain goes up. Some UK performances have been cancelled or postponed again this year because of Covid worries. But as players and directors always insist, the show must go on. So after all the crises, catastrophes, and avoidable and unavoidable grief that world leaders put everyone through in the past 12 months, it’s only fair to indulge in a bit of virtual seasonal tomfoolery and raillery at their expense. Please give a big hand for the cast of Political Panto 2021! The Dame: Physical characteristics aside, Trump’s claim to be dame is boosted by his unmatched ability to bluster, boast and brag. He can also be extremely, unintentionally amusing. Only last week, the “once and future king” claimed the pandemic was a Chinese plot to foil his rightful bid to rule the world. US presidents often overthrow foreign governments. Trump was the first to try to overthrow his own, thereby redefining the banana republic concept. He jokes he won the 2020 election – and keeps a straight face. He even thinks Vlad “the Impaler” Putin is cool. Besides, Trump would look cute in a dress. Gee, what a dame! The Clown: Many contenders vie for the role of comic lead. Top acts include Éric Zemmour, the far-right presidential candidate of Algerian parentage, who says immigrants are destroying France, and Armin Laschet, the German conservative who thought floods were a laughing matter – until he was drowned out. Channelling Dick Whittington, fallen idol Daniel Ortega voted himself lord mayor of Nicaragua – again! Iran’s turbaned mullah-in-chief, Ebrahim Raisi, who successfully hides his funny side, insisted he really doesn’t want nuclear bombs. Yo, Netanyahu! Just kidding! Turkish straight man Recep Tayyip Erdoğan would jail Cinders, Goldilocks and the Pantomime Horse and Cow if he thought they supported the Kurds. Yet after multiple standup auditions in posh boys’ drinking clubs at Eton, Oxford and Westminster, this year’s comic crown goes to Downing Street’s Buttons: knockabout gagster Boris Johnson, Britain’s pretend prime minister. BoJo partied on regardless as a locked-down nation died of laughter (or just died). As fools, humbugs and charlatans go, there’s no beating Boris! The Fairy Godmother: This wondrous panto sprite dispenses universal goodwill, starlight and transcendental happiness without resorting to class A drugs. In Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty, her magical powers protect her protege from a horrid fate, ensuring she lives happily ever after. Sic. This godparent gig was performed for 16 years by Good Fairy Angela Merkel, known to Germans as “Mutti” (Mummy), firmly guiding a sleepy, slipshod EU. Merkel made the role her own. Now she’s hanging up her wand. Boo! Bad Fairies Liz Truss and Ursula von der Leyen are less glamorous understudies. The Principal Boy: This goody-goody character, traditionally played by a woman in tights and thigh-length boots, could suit Joe Biden, who’s so nice it hurts – although he might trip on his heels. Gabriel Boric, the young socialist voted in as Chile’s president last week, may go far – except the same was said of Salvador Allende. Yet with his charisma, sexy sideburns and strategic vision (as stated in his CV), Emmanuel Macron, the pocket-sized French president also known as Manu, Jupiter and “choupinet” (poppet or sweetie), is a boyish shoo-in. Macron vows to save Europe. Carol singers gratefully chorus: “O come, O come, Emmanuel!” The Baddie: Villains were 10 a penny in 2021, and it’s hard to say who was worst. Belarus’s Alexander Lukashenko staged a vicious parody of Babes in the Wood using helpless refugees. Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, like the mean-spirited Grinch who stole Christmas, tried to cancel democracy. In Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, the climate-change-denying Wicked Witch of the West, could not see the wood for chopped-down trees. Like Aladdin, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, rubbed his lamp – and dreamed of rubbing out opponents. Myanmar’s genocidal general, Min Aung Hlaing, North Korea’s Kim Jong-un and the Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte made the Three Ugly Sisters look positively attractive. In Russia, Putin – when not threatening to invade Ukraine – played Robin Hood backwards, stealing from the poor to make oligarchs rich. But it’s China’s leader, Xi Jinping, who gets the nod as the baddiest baddie of them all. Whether it was horror in Xinjiang, hooliganism in Hong Kong, threats to bash Taiwan, dodgy debt deals in Africa, or cyberspying around the world, Xi seemed to be everywhere, like some wicked beanstalk giant or goggle-eyed, fire-breathing dragon. Where’s St George when you really need him? As 2022’s political pantomime season opens, watch out for Xi. He’s behind you! Oh yes he is!",Opinion/Opinion,Nothing like a dame: Trump tops 2021’s cast of clowns and baddies,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/26/nothing-like-a-dame-trump-tops-2021s-cast-of-clowns-and-baddies
12/26/2021,"Exploring Leicester Museum & Art Gallery 12 years ago, trainee curator Tara Munroe came across a stack of discarded oil paintings. The troubling scenes they portrayed would go on to change the direction of her career and may soon alter wider attitudes to art history. The paintings depicted wealthy colonial life in South America and the Caribbean, and had been marked for destruction by the gallery. But the images, which each subtly grade racial and social distinctions, spoke clearly and powerfully to Munroe.  “To me, they are beautiful paintings but they have a very dark message within them,” she told the Observer as she prepared for the first public display of the unrestored paintings, in Leicester in the new year. Now an expert in black heritage and the director of Opal 22 Arts and Edutainment, Munroe has doggedly continued her research into the origin and meaning of the five rare late-18th-century works she found. First, she persuaded the city’s art gallery & museum to save the works that had originally been categorised as distasteful and irrelevant, then she started to try to discover who had painted them and why. In the last few months, she has won funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund to curate a further, bigger exhibition of the paintings in 2023. The works are examples of a genre known as “casta paintings” and there is only one other collection in Britain. It is also thought there are only about 100 complete or partial paintings known of anywhere, making the Leicester find of international significance. “I want to help people understand the history of racial stereotyping in the colonial era and how the colour bar actually worked. I’d also like to link it to the academic discipline of critical race theory,” explained Munroe. “I’m from a mixed Caribbean background myself, although I am paler skinned, and so I know it is important to study the way colour has been used. It is why the paintings connected with me so much,” she said. The re-evaluation of the paintings Munroe put in train is an instance of allowing prejudiced art back into the visual arts canon, or even “un-cancelling”, and it remains an unorthodox, sometimes controversial approach. Some of the terms used then are now regarded as offensive. “Mulatto is still understood,” said Munroe. “And there are others such as Lobo, or wolf, which was what someone half-Indian and half-black was called. I want to move away from these labels without losing the history, and to be honest I’m scratching my head about the best way to do it.” Munroe, who grew up in Luton, has Chinese and African heritage, and recalls that at school fellow pupils would ask what she was. “My mother would just say ‘green with pink spots’, but that didn’t really help me,” she recalls. Casta paintings date from the 1600s to the beginning of the 19th century and were designed to show race and class divisions in Spanish colonies. Facial expressions and physical attitudes all encode the hierarchy and status of the people painted, and sometimes racial mixtures are identified and inscribed on the canvas. The works Munroe found, which also express contemporary anxieties about racial mixing, were originally donated to the Leicester museum in 1852, by Joseph Noble, a lord mayor of the city. “For me, perhaps the biggest interest to this story is how it shows that we see things differently when we come from a different perspective,” Munroe explains. “A lot of people had looked at these paintings before, and they were just being used to train picture restorers before they were destroyed. It was only because I was working there that I saw something in them. There is a new level of understanding that comes when you have different people working somewhere.” After the restoration work is complete later next year, Munroe plans a series of events and lectures with the aim of understanding the progression of academic attitudes to racial identity.",News/World news,Gallery aims to reclaim narrative with its racist ‘casta’ paintings,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/26/gallery-aims-to-reclaim-narrative-with-its-racist-casta-paintings
12/26/2021,"Perhaps I won’t have woken up this morning to the sound of clattering England wickets in the Boxing Day heat of Melbourne. Perhaps, by the time you read this, England will have taken control of the game, even after having capitulated lamely in the first two Tests of the Ashes series. But I would not bet on it. Insanity, they say, is doing the same thing again and expecting a different outcome. There is certainly a touch of insanity in watching England play Test cricket. For those who don’t follow cricket, all this might seem as meaningful as an arcane theological debate over Christmas lunch. England’s travails on the cricket field tell us something, however, about more than just cricket. They illuminate the yearning of our age for immediate highs and instant gratification – and show why that rarely satisfies.  The paradox of England’s abysmal Test showing is its success in T20 cricket. For those whose lives are lived beyond the boundary of cricket, I should explain that the game is now split into three distinct formats. In Test cricket, the match can last for up to five days. The “one-day” game was introduced as a shortened version in the 1960s. An even shorter version, Twenty20 (or T20), was born in 2003, a format in which the whole match is completed in around three hours. (There is a shorter version still called The Hundred, but it is played only in England.) In Test cricket, England have lost recent series against India and New Zealand and are currently being dismantled by Australia. Yet, despite being bundled out of the T20 World Cup by New Zealand in November, England remain the top-ranked T20 nation in the world and have reset the way the game is played with their swashbuckling, adventurous style. The desire to invent shorter forms of cricket has been part of the longstanding quest to fit the game into the rhythms of modern life and to make it more exciting. With five-day matches, baffling rules and arcane traditions, Test cricket, of all contemporary sports, must be the one least adapted to the demands of daily life or to the modern temperament. The idea of T20 has been not just to shorten the play but to make it a more thrill-a-minute game. It has certainly attracted the fans, especially in India, where the Indian Premier League has become a magnet for the world’s best players and helped turn the nation into a powerhouse of the game. It has transformed players, making them more athletic, inventive and skilful, some of which has been transferred to the Test arena. Yet much of the guile, craft and patience that defines the longer form of the game has been eroded. And nowhere more so, it would seem, than within the England team. T20 is to Test cricket as a burger is to filet mignon. It’s more exciting only if we confuse cheap thrills with true drama. Drama is what lies at the heart of sport, drama both in the sense of telling a story and as the distillation of moments of great tension. In every game, whether cricket, football or kabaddi, a story unfolds, with villains and heroes, humiliation and catharsis, despair and redemption. The games we remember most are those with the graded shades of highs and lows, of tension and tedium, the ones that leave you feeling as if you have lived a novella. And no sport embodies drama as much as cricket. Cricket has the space and the structure to allow for complex narratives to develop. Complaining that a Test match lasts five days is a bit like moaning that watching Hamlet takes four hours out of your life. It’s no accident that so many great dramatists – Beckett, Pinter, Stoppard, Ayckbourn, Rattigan – have been drawn to the game. The storylines of sport come not just from within the game but from how it is embedded in society and in history, too. Every sport inspires myths, engenders rivalries, arouses a collective sense of hope and aspiration, is infused by broader threads of politics and themes of race, class, gender and nationhood. And all are worked into the drama of sport. Great moments of drama cannot be manufactured artificially to create a thrill, but emerge organically from the narrative. England all-rounder Ben Stokes’s sensational innings to defeat Australia at Headingley in 2019, in a game that by all logic England should have lost; the “miracle of Istanbul” in 2005 when Liverpool were crowned champions of Europe despite the game seemingly being beyond them by half-time; the “Rumble in the Jungle” in 1974, when Muhammad Ali defeated George Foreman to regain his world title in the heat of Kinshasa after having been stripped of it seven years earlier for refusing to fight in Vietnam – all are exhilarating only because of the storyline that built up to the climax and, especially in the Ali-Foreman fight, of the deeper context in which the event is embedded. This is why, compared to Test cricket, T20 can seem more exciting yet less satisfying. It can electrify but, stripped of the wider storyline that infuses it with meaning, it can also feel soulless. This is true not just of cricket. At the climax of this year’s Formula One season in Abu Dhabi, a genuinely thrilling showdown between Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen descended into controversy and farce thanks to the decision by the race controller to ignore the rulebook and create a one-lap contest in the final lap. It was a stark reminder that contrived thrills rarely satisfy in sport. In an age in which the 24-hour news cycle puts a premium on the scandalous and the shocking; in which we demand instant streaming rather than have to wait a week for the next episode of a TV series; in which it feels difficult to spend a day immersed in a book without reaching for the distraction of the phone to view the latest WhatsApp message – it is not surprising that sport, too, should seek to satisfy our craving for the instant fix and the constant high. We should resist the temptation. There are certainly times when I hanker for a burger as comfort food. But if I really want to feast, I need that slab of proper steak. Not to mention an England victory in Melbourne.  Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",Opinion/Opinion,The thrills! The spills!
