2/19/2022,"Having spent more than 20 years of my career looking at education systems all over the world, including in countries such as China and Singapore, I know first hand the role of the classroom in shaping the way that students understand society. That’s why I was disappointed to see the Department for Education’s new guidance for England on political impartiality in the classroom this week, which threatens that understanding. The confusing new advice will make it harder for teachers to tackle vital subjects such as the climate crisis and racism, by pushing for them to be “taught in an impartial manner”. In particular, the guidance singles out the antiracist campaign Black Lives Matter – which has been central to forming societal attitudes around racial injustice – as having no place in the classroom. In the words of the Department for Education, the campaign goes “beyond the basic shared principle that racism is unacceptable”. The history of the empire, meanwhile, should be taught “in a balanced manner”.  Rather than restrictions, teachers need support and encouragement in teaching about these issues. Research published last year by the Runnymede Trust and Penguin Books found that fewer than 1% of students in England study a book by writer of colour at GCSE, with a key barrier to introducing more diverse texts being teachers’ lack of confidence in talking about race and racism in the classroom. Only 12% of primary and 13% of secondary school English teachers who we interviewed reported having had training on how to talk about race, with many teachers asking for further support on how to tackle the subject. Just last month, more than 1,000 teachers registered for a Lit in Colour webinar focusing on ways to approach teaching race in the English classroom, hosted with the Times Educational Supplement and the National Association for the Teaching of English. Teachers need support and there is more we can do to provide it. A separate Runnymede Trust survey of history teachers in 2019 found that 78% wanted training on teaching about migration and 71% on teaching about empire. Racist bullying in schools has been a serious issue over the past five years, with 60,000 recorded incidents since 2016 – which is likely to be the tip of the iceberg. That this guidance threatens those conversations in the classroom is profoundly disturbing. After the events of the past year, in which Covid has exposed the extent of the structural inequalities facing Black and ethnic minority groups, there could be no more important time to talk about race and racism in the classroom – yet the government proposes limiting these dialogues. Without a clear understanding of racism, pupils will not be taught to become antiracist citizens and will lack vital knowledge of how race, migration and empire have shaped the UK. Politicians across the spectrum agree that we must stamp out racism. They have all pledged to deal with inequality. Yet progress continues to be stymied by a purposely vague war on “wokeness”, used to remove the tools that could actually address these challenges. We need to be teaching about the harmful effects of racism, instilling in our children the fundamental value of racial equality and broader social equity, and ensuring schools have antiracist strategies. Is it contradictory that the government is trying to prevent the stifling of open debate in universities, but appears to be imposing a standardised conformity with very little room for difference of opinion in our schools? Promoting diversity of thought is where the strength of our education system lies, and the government is threatening that by introducing confusing guidance that may well shut down conversations about race in their entirety. In recent years, language of “impartiality and balance” has been used to stifle work on race equality and exposing the ugly history of colonialism. Alongside our colleagues at Barnardo’s and the National Trust, our work supporting ethnic minority communities has often been challenged on grounds of imbalance in this debate. I am deeply concerned that this guidance will introduce this thinking in schools, and make the teaching of race and empire political, or a facet of a culture war none of us want to be fighting – least of all our students.

2/19/2022,"Former Post Office workers have broken down in tears recounting the depression and PTSD they suffered after being caught up in the organisation’s IT scandal. More than 700 Post Office operators were prosecuted for theft and false accounting between 2000 and 2014 after the organisation’s flawed Horizon IT system incorrectly suggested there were financial shortfalls.  On Friday, former worker Jennifer O’Dell said she had considered suicide and suffered from recurring night terrors. She was accused of stealing almost £10,000 from a post office in Cambridgeshire. Speaking at the end of the first week of the independent inquiry into the scandal, O’Dell said she had researched how to take her own life, as well as suffering from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). She said: “I went to some very dark places, extremely dark places. I even worked out how to commit suicide. I had to have anti-depressants. I had to have sleeping pills. I had night terrors where my husband had to wake me up. “And it wasn’t just once every so often, it was two or three times a week. I had high blood pressure as well. “After the court case in December, I suffered from PTSD and had to have counselling. That was awful. I hadn’t been at war. I hadn’t lost a limb. They caused that.” O’Dell was suspended and, although not prosecuted, she said months of uncertainty left her expecting to “wake up to a court summons”. She said: “I want those people brought to justice. I want them to be persecuted and that’s not at all like me. I want them to say ‘yes, we did it, we didn’t tell the truth on oath’. I want them to say sorry.” The inquiry also heard a written statement on behalf of Guy Vinall, who ran a post office in Funtington, near Chichester in West Sussex. He was threatened with prosecution when the Horizon system showed a £28,000 shortfall. He ran the branch between 2004 and 2009 after taking over from his father, who had been manager for 20 years. They both took out loans to pay back the shortfall, thus avoiding prosecution. Vinall was sacked in January 2010. In his statement, he told how he suffered a mental breakdown, turned to alcohol and attempted suicide several times before being admitted to a mental health institution. The statement added: “Guy Vinall feels that he cannot ever be fully compensated for what the Post Office has done. He says that they have literally ripped the life out of me.” Meanwhile, Linda Little, who started working for the Post Office when she was 16, said being accused of stealing “sent me crazy”. She said she paid over £90,000 of her own money to cover the alleged shortfalls. “The Post Office took everything from me. They ended my career which I had built from the age of 16 and I absolutely loved my job, I really did,” she said. “They took away my retirement plans and my daughter’s and nephew’s futures as they were going to take over the business from me.” On Thursday, Susan Hazzleton, 68, said her children were taunted in the school playground when her Post Office branch in Chelmsford, Essex closed in 2001. Her children were told their mother was a liar and a thief and that she was “the reason the village did not have a Post Office or shop any more, Hazzleton said. William Graham, 53, who managed the Riverhead sub-post office near Sevenoaks, was convicted for the concealment of supposed losses of £65,521 in January 2011 and received a suspended prison sentence. He was one of 39 former workers to have their convictions quashed by the court of appeal in April 2021. Fighting back tears, Graham told the inquiry on Wednesday his conviction had left him feeling worthless. “I visited the area with my wife and we were basically told ‘we shouldn’t be speaking to you, we shouldn’t talk to you, we shouldn’t be seen to be talking to you’,” he said. Damian Owen, who managed a Post Office branch in Bangor, north Wales, was jailed for eight months after he was accused of stealing £25,000 as a result of computer errors. His conviction was quashed and he believes the former management should face charges. He said: “I want there to be convictions, not only for the people who have perpetuated the whole conspiracy inside the Post Office, everyone from the top down who knew and was still pushing charges.” The inquiry, which continues on Monday, expects to hear from about 60 former Post Office workers.",News/Business,‘They ripped the life out of me’: ex-Post Office staff tell inquiry of stress of IT scandal,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/18/ex-post-office-staff-tell-inquiry-of-stress-of-it-scandal
2/19/2022,"Production of the BBC’s MasterChef will be moved to Birmingham from 2024, the first time the show will be made outside London in more than 20 years. The series will be made at the new Digbeth Loc studios founded by the Peaky Blinders creator, Steven Knight as part of a six-year deal.  The BBC director general, Tim Davie, said: “This is great news for Birmingham and the BBC. We said we would create jobs and investment, bringing decision-making and productions to the West Midlands as part of our ‘Across the UK’ plans. Moving one of our biggest programme brands shows we are making that a reality.” Last year, the BBC pledged to increase the proportion of its television budget spent outside London from 50% to 60% by 2028, and said it would relocate 400 jobs outside the capital. MasterChef is one of the BBC’s most prominent shows and its highest rating cookery format over the past five years. The six-year deal also means spinoff shows including MasterChef: The Professionals, Celebrity MasterChef and the recently announced Young MasterChef for BBC Three, as well as any festive editions, will be made in Birmingham. “I am genuinely thrilled that MasterChef is coming to Birmingham,” Knight said. “We will work hard to ensure that this internationally renowned TV institution instantly feels at home in our creative environment, and we look forward to welcoming many more blue chip brands into our rapidly expanding media neighbourhood.” Andy Street, the mayor of the West Midlands, said the announcement was a “real vote of confidence, and the first major step of this new renewed commitment to the region by the BBC”. The success of Peaky Blinders has led to a record number of tourists heading to Birmingham in recent years and Knight’s new film and TV production studio, which is to be unveiled on Friday, will be where the movie version is made. The studio is a few hundred yards from where the first recorded attack by the real “peaky blinders” took place on 23 March 1890. Birmingham is becoming an increasingly popular filming location for Hollywood films. Tom Cruise filmed scenes for the latest Mission Impossible there last year and Steven Spielberg used the region for parts of his sci-fi adventure Ready Player One.",Arts/Television & radio,BBC MasterChef production to move to Birmingham from 2024,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/18/bbc-masterchef-move-to-birmingham-2024-peaky-blinders
2/19/2022,"The run-up to an album release is all about teasing and pleasing the fans: thrilling videos, the promise of a fantasy-fulfilling collaboration, the drip-fed unveiling of a musician’s new era. But earlier this month, the British pop star Charli XCX said she was stepping back from Twitter after receiving negative comments from fans about the campaign for her forthcoming album, Crash. “I have been feeling like I can’t do anything right at the moment,” she said. “I’ve noticed lately that a few people seem quite angry at me – for the choices of songs I’ve chosen to release, for the way I’ve decided to roll out my campaign, for the things I need to do to fund what will be the greatest tour I’ve ever done. I’ve been grappling with my mental health the past few months and obviously it makes negativity and criticism harder to handle.”  For now, she said, she would draft tweets for her team to post on her behalf, “because I can’t really handle it here right now”. Charli XCX (born Charlotte Aitchison) isn’t the only major pop star to retreat from social media: Billie Eilish abandoned Twitter to preserve her mental health; the US indie star Mitski deleted her accounts after the conclusion of her 2019 tour. The problem hits musicians in a unique way. Actors are not expected to self-promote to the same extent and often eschew social media; writers generally don’t have such large followings nor the parasocial relationships that come with them. But stepping away isn’t an option for every musician experiencing digital burnout – especially after the lack of gigs and in-person promotional opportunities diminished during the pandemic, increasing the pressure on artists to constantly share updates on their work online. Darren Hemmings is a marketing manager who works with acts including Run the Jewels, Wolf Alice and Jungle. “There was a weird logic that became perpetuated as fact: you’re not on tour so you’ve got plenty of time to be all over everything. There are examples where that was a terrific move for some people but telling artists who have been around a long time that they need to be doing more when, in reality, they’ve got less to say because they’re not doing anything, leads to this ‘always on’ mentality that I think is pretty unhealthy.” As XCX noted, social media isn’t exactly a haven for kindness and positivity. And it’s not just negative comments that can make it difficult for musicians. The expectation to constantly put on a happy face can be “draining” says German singer-songwriter Au/Ra, who says she pressurises herself to keep up with the online world. “It is something I judge myself for, it’s a guilt pattern and a comparison thing to other social media accounts.” Sara Quin of Canadian pop duo Tegan and Sara says she derives “0% pleasure” from the Google Doc containing the band’s social media calendar: “Myspace or Facebook posts used to be an add-on but now it feels like making music is about making assets for social media.” Yet when the duo were searching for a new record label, they repeatedly encountered expectations that they should have a widespread and active online presence. “We’re always looking for new revenue streams and opportunities because we’re not touring and I hate to admit it, but our social media reach dictates everything for a band like us,” says Quin. “Our online metrics equate to how much a record company will give us for a record or how much [US festival] Coachella will give us to play Saturday at 3pm.” The two years of the pandemic also correspond with the rise of TikTok as a key platform for music discovery and promotion: new acts including UK producer PinkPantheress and Brit award-nominated UK singer songwriter Mimi Webb first found an audience there. So did US country artist Priscilla Block, who got her start by posting original content and music five times a day or more, according to her co-manager, Crystal Block. Within a few months of putting all her spare time into the app, she released a song, Just About Over You, which was funded by fans through a campaign on TikTok. The track went viral, landing at No 1 on iTunes’s all-genre chart, and helped her secure a record deal. Block just released her debut album, Welcome to the Block Party, but the work doesn’t stop there. Now, says Crystal, “there is always that pressure to make everything new go viral”. That potential to reach new listeners has record labels pressurising artists to add another social media platform to an already overflowing plate that typically includes Instagram, Twitter and Facebook. Even Adele, who had the biggest-selling album of 2021, isn’t immune: in an interview with Zane Lowe, she recalled a meeting where someone at her label suggested that she got on TikTok to ensure 14-year-olds knew who she was. Beyond the few examples of acts whose social media presence has paid obvious dividends, Hemmings questions whether all the time and effort musicians spend on social media is worth it. Due to limited reach, not every post will be seen by their audience, unless it’s a paid-for advert. “You see a lot of artists shouting into the void,” he says. Instead, Hemmings encourages those he works with to build communities on channels that create a more direct route to fans, as with pre-social media fanclubs. It’s a burgeoning world: Run the Jewels have an email database; dance behemoths Chase & Status have a WhatsApp group with fans; British indie artist Bat for Lashes established a Patreon offering exclusive content. In 2020, Sheffield metalcore band While She Sleeps also started their own fan membership platform on Patreon, Sleeps Society. It has about 1,500 members. “It doesn’t sound like a huge amount of people but it makes enough money to keep the band afloat,” says guitarist Mat Welsh. In January, Tegan and Sara launched a Substack newsletter offering in-depth insight into their creative process, which has more than 6,000 subscribers and a paid-for tier priced at $6 (£4.40) a month. “Substack is us unselfconsciously saying, ‘We like our words and our ideas and our stories have value’,” says Quin. “So much of what social media feels like is that we work for those companies, like Spotify, Instagram and Facebook, and don’t necessarily feel any benefit. It feels like I’m always just supplying more content for the food chain.” Still, these alternatives aren’t wholesale replacements for social media. “I want to find people where they are,” says Quin. “I’m not trying to siphon them all into one place, but I’m never going to lie and tell you that I like social media. I hate it but I will do it because I don’t want people to miss out.” Welsh agrees: “Sleeps Society and social media are complementary for us. Our social channels are there for casual fans who want to engage on and off but the community is for those who would consider us ‘their’ band.” Despite the emerging alternatives available, the catch-22 remains for artists trying to have a healthier relationship to the internet while also promoting their work in an ever-more competitive field. “Fans are intelligent people who can immediately see through artists spending time trying to do it all or having an impact just because they feel they need to be,” says Sophie Kennard, manager of Chase & Status. “The moment that it feels a bit disingenuous, it’s game over anyway. So they might as well utilise their time elsewhere.” Ultimately, despite all the pitfalls of social media, there may be no going back. “Sometimes I wish the electrical grid would go down so I wouldn’t have to do it any more,” says Quin. “But we’re in the maze and I don’t know how to get out.”",Arts/Music,‘Making music is about making assets for social media’: pop stars battle digital burnout,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/18/making-music-is-about-making-assets-for-social-media-pop-stars-battle-digital-burnout
2/19/2022,"Britain’s 4x100m relay team has been stripped of its 2020 Olympic silver medal after CJ Ujah’s failed doping test at the Tokyo Games was confirmed. The news marks the biggest doping scandal in British Olympic history, and only the second time that a Team GB athlete has lost a medal at summer or winter Games. The first, skier Alain Baxter, lost his alpine slalom bronze medal in 2002 after using a Vicks inhaler purchased in the US. It later transpired that the same inhaler bought in the UK did not contain the illegal substance.  The news was confirmed following a hearing at the court of arbitration for sport in November but only revealed on Friday. It found that the 27-year-old sprinter did have two banned substances in a urine sample, ostarine and S-23, which are known as selective androgen receptor modulators that mimic testosterone in the body. Ujah had blamed his failed test on a contaminated supplement. However under the strict liability rules of the World Anti-Doping Agency that is no defence. In a statement Ujah said: “I accept the decision issued by the court of arbitration for sport today with sadness. I would like to make it clear that I unknowingly consumed a contaminated supplement and this was the reason why an anti-doping rule violation occurred at the Tokyo Olympic Games. “I sincerely regret that this has inadvertently led to the forfeiture of the men’s 4x100m relay team’s Olympic silver medals at the Tokyo Olympic Games. I would like to apologise to my teammates, their families and support teams for the impact which this has had on them. That is something I will regret for the rest of my life.” The British men’s quartet of Ujah, Zharnel Hughes, Richard Kilty and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake missed out on the 4x100m title by just a hundredth of a second in Tokyo, as the anchor-leg runner Mitchell-Blake was overhauled on the line by Italy’s Filippo Tortu. However, days later it was revealed that Ujah had tested positive for ostarine, which is used to treat muscle wasting and osteoporosis, and S‑23, which targets the muscle and bone tissues to promote muscle growth and bone health. The length of Ujah’s ban will now be determined in a future hearing by the Athletics Integrity Unit but it could be as long as four years. A spokesperson for UK Athletics said it was in regular communication with the athletes concerned, but added that it would not be making public comment on the case until after the World Athletics/AIU process which will follow on from this Cas outcome. The news means that Canada are upgraded to silver behind gold medallists Italy, while China now take bronze. Meanwhile Britain’s tally from the Tokyo 2020 Games is reduced to 64.",Sport/Sport,Team GB lose 4x100m Olympic silver after Ujah doping confirmed,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/18/team-gb-lose-4x100m-olympic-silver-after-ujah-doping-confirmed
2/19/2022,"A sudden end to testing and isolation could lead to rapid epidemic growth of the coronavirus, experts have warned. On Monday Boris Johnson is due to outline a “living safely with Covid” plan for England, which is expected to include a lifting of all remaining restrictions and changes to testing and isolation.  Among expected proposals is the scrapping of free home-delivered lateral flow tests, and a winding down of PCR testing. It is also likely the requirement for anyone with Covid to isolate will end soon. However, experts on the government’s scientific pandemic influenza group on modelling operational subgroup, known as SPI-M-O, which feeds into Sage, have warned that ending testing and isolation could lead to a return to rapid epidemic growth of the coronavirus. In a document released on Friday the group note that estimates from a modelling team at the University of Warwick suggest that a combination of measures and behavioural change such as testing, self-isolation, mask wearing and increased home working are currently reducing transmission by approximately 20-45%. “Warwick’s estimates are equivalent to there being the potential for transmission to increase by between around 25% and 80% if the population were to return to pre-pandemic behaviours and no mitigations,” the document says. “Warwick’s analysis indicates that, while behaviour change following the lifting of restrictions has previously been gradual, a sudden change, such as an end to testing and isolation, has the scope to lead to a return to rapid epidemic growth.” The group add that factors such as waning immunity, seasonality and the emergence of new variants could also affect transmission, either driving it up or down, adding that BA.2 – a close cousin of Omicron that is currently increasing in prevalence in the UK – may have a growth advantage over other forms of the variant. “If this were the case, it is possible that SPI-M-O’s medium-term projections may underestimate the short-term trajectory of hospitalisations,” the group wrote. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the chair of the BMA council, also raised concerns over potential changes to testing and isolation, noting that data from the Office for National Statistics suggested about 1 in 20 people in England were infected last week, and there continues to be significant work absence due to Covid. “It’s clear that we will have to learn to adjust to the reality of Covid-19. However, the BMA agrees with NHS leaders that living with Covid doesn’t mean ignoring its continued harm to many, and must not result in removing protections to some of the most vulnerable in our society. Scrapping all restrictions and allowing the infection to spread in an unmonitored and unfettered manner would be damaging to the health of millions, including for those who go on to suffer long Covid symptoms,” he said. “Without access to free testing for the public or a legal requirement for the sick to self-isolate, protecting others from illness and surveillance of the disease and its prevalence vanishes; we won’t know where outbreaks are happening, whether they are circulating among more vulnerable populations, and this means local public health teams will be lacking key information to be able to respond effectively to Covid outbreaks in their local areas,” he added. “Charging for tests will only discourage people from checking if they have Covid, especially if their symptoms are mild enough for them to continue socialising and mixing with others.” Nagpau added that World Health Organization had released updated guidance this week for contact tracing and quarantine, which said any interruption or shortening of these measures would increase the risk of onward transmission. “Of course, we all want to see a time when measures are no longer needed,” said Nagpau. “However, relaxing them must be done sensibly, based on data, and gradually, in consultation with the profession, and not at the cost of public health or our already-stretched NHS.”",News/World news,"Ending Covid tests and isolation may cause rapid rise in virus, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/18/ending-covid-tests-and-isolation-may-cause-rapid-rise-in-virus-say-experts
2/19/2022,"I was at high school during the first Iraq war, when rolling news was a relatively new thing. It was wild to turn on the TV and see a correspondent in a flak jacket, filming the bombing of Baghdad through his hotel window, or standing in front of a chain-link fence by a runway, trying to fill in airtime like it was regular TV.  That was 1991. By the time of the second Gulf war, we were used to live footage from war zones, and nearly 20 years after that – and a decade after the Arab spring – we’ve become accustomed to the role played by social media in armed conflict. On Monday, as Russian troops lined up on the border with Ukraine, the coverage was dissonant in what felt like new ways. Aerial footage of the Russian army looked like throwback visuals from the second world war – the difference being that if you happened upon these images via your social media feeds they were accompanied down the righthand column by a stream of broken hearts, sparkling hearts and disappointed face emojis. In principle, an account called @funny_vidz posting “stay strong Ukraine” alongside a flexed biceps emoji is no more pathetic than any amount of slightly better-dressed commentary. Nonetheless, the presentation was jarring, as was the White House statement on Monday informing us that a Russian invasion could happen “at any time”. Popping up as a news alert on one’s phone, it had about it the vibe of a five-minute reminder on a dental appointment or your next Zoom meeting. Heads up, guys, war’s on! Of course, the fact I’m remarking on this at all is completely in line with tradition. The debate around rolling news 20 years ago could be cut and pasted straight into discussions about TikTok coverage of war in Ukraine. Jack Straw, then foreign secretary, went for the full first world war reach in 2003 in a speech that might be dusted off and reused every time. “Had the public been able to see live coverage from the first world war trenches, I wonder for how long the governments of Asquith and Lloyd George could have maintained the war effort. Imagine the carnage of the Somme on Sky and BBC News 24.” Imagine, indeed. Big thumbs down, crying face emoji. A friend has tickets for The Music Man on Broadway, the hottest show since Hamilton. It stars Hugh Jackman as the conman Harold Hill, who, in the execution of a complicated swindle, tries to sweet talk his way into selling band instruments to the children of a small Iowa town. It is a big, overblown musical of a kind I haven’t seen for years and every song – Seventy-Six Trombones, (Ya Got) Trouble, Till There Was You – is a winner. In a packed theatre, as the orchestra swells and the big numbers get under way, it feels like the perfect antidote to two miserable years. As Marion the librarian, Sutton Foster is sublime, not least in her ability to suspend disbelief in the face of her co-star. Jackman, spry at 53, turns in a busy performance motored less by the demands of the role than by his obvious enthusiasm for being Hugh Jackman. This is no bad thing if you are, indeed, Hugh Jackman, but for everyone else it can get a little wearying. It hardly matters. The musical, which was written by Meredith Willson in 1957, does that thing all good musicals do, which is to send up America’s hucksterish values while celebrating something pure-hearted behind them. As with the best shows, there’s always something new. I’ve seen The Music Man a million times and never noticed it: as the children’s instruments, ordered by Hill, arrive on stage on the Wells Fargo wagon, my friend leans in to hiss: “If he’s paid for the instruments what exactly is the fraud?” The Trojan Horse affair, a podcast put out by the New York Times in conjunction with Serial, is an important and shocking investigation into the 2014 claims made in Britain that a Muslim plot was under way to infiltrate Birmingham schools and radicalise the kids. The podcast exposes the allegations as fraudulent, and nails the racist uses to which they were put at the highest levels of government. According to the podcast’s dogged reporting, the letter at the centre of the story appears to be a hoax. I start listening to the show while tidying up, and am so gripped that I do a more thorough clean of my house than has been done in two years. It’s not just the drama of the investigation. There is something delicious about the application of the gigantic machinery of American journalism to a story that has its roots in a petty local government dispute. In an early episode, Brian Reed, the American host and reporter, interviews a woman called Bridget, who works for Birmingham city council. Reed is accompanied by his co-host, a journalist from Birmingham called Hamza Syed, but it’s the American who cross-examines Bridget as if she’s Bob Haldeman. Caught in an apparent contradiction, Bridget titters “I’m not psychic”, a tone – defensive sarcasm masquerading as bonhomie – recognisable to anyone familiar with British bureaucracy. The story had huge ramifications nationally, lives were ruined and entire communities were maligned, all of which the podcast definitively uncovers. Still, for pure entertainment, it’s hard to touch US journalism’s finest presenting, with all the portentousness of Watergate, the scoop “mid-level functionary at Birmingham city council seems a bit shifty and underpowered shocker”. I wasn’t going to watch Reacher, the new eight-episode adaptation of Lee Child’s series of novels on Amazon, but then I did and I urge you to follow me. It’s like a warm bath, a return to the pleasures of 80s TV, when heroic fugitives operating under false names fashioned battering rams out of scrap metal to bring down the bad guys and restore justice to small-town America. There are guns and explosions, but not in a gory, Ozark way, and unlike all other bingeable TV at the moment, nothing about Reacher is in italics. He’s just a guy with massive shoulders, bouldering his way through various villains, the purest pleasure of baloney. On the walk to school, my children ask for true stories from the news. They like disaster and mayhem, anything involving people getting trapped in or under things, plane crashes, ship wrecks, extreme weather events, plunging elevators and miraculous rescues and escapes. When the news doesn’t deliver, I scramble for material. We’ve done, in summarised form, Romeo and Juliet (“that’s dumb, why didn’t she leave a note?”), Lord of the Flies (big tick), Mutiny on the Bounty, Rabbit Proof Fence, the Mary Celeste and the Bermuda triangle. Occasionally, I abuse their trust and try to sneak in something slightly more educational. “How about Russia’s imminent invasion of Ukraine?” Instantaneous and categorical “no”.",News/UK news,Digested week: prospect of war in Ukraine deserves more than sad face emojis | Emma Brockes,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/18/digested-week-prospect-war-ukraine-deserve-more-than-sad-face-emoji
2/19/2022,"The customary brouhaha erupted yesterday after the release of Vanity Fair’s annual Hollywood Issue cover photos, the most striking of which depicts an angry Benedict Cumberbatch emerging fully clothed from a hot bubblebath sesh with a bevy of swans. The Hollywood Issue increasingly feels like it belongs to a different era, when fashion magazines and actors’ star power were at their respective heights. These days, the printed press is clinging on for dear life (Entertainment Weekly announced just last week that it will be ceasing its print edition), and in Hollywood no one performer is bigger than a franchise. So the Hollywood Issue, which trades in the nose-to-the-window glamour of movie stars, has a more forlorn quality than it used to.  Oscar nominee and #ThePowerOfTheDog star Benedict Cumberbatch isn’t afraid to poke industry Goliaths: “If I’m in the belly of the beast, then surely I can start asking questions of it.”🔗: https://t.co/S91iqSvQmv pic.twitter.com/AVUkRE6bou In previous issues – such as the “Legends of Hollywood” iteration in 2001, featuring Nicole Kidman, Catherine Deneuve, Meryl Streep and Gwyneth Paltrow variously bestriding and draped over plush scenery – the magazine veritably crowed about the glamour of its catches, and, by extension, its own Brobdingnagian pulling power. Annie Leibovitz has since been taken off photography duties and the covers have been somewhat de-whitened (the extravagantly alabaster tones of 2010’s roster would quite rightly not pass muster in 2022); Maurizio Cattelan and Pierpaolo Ferrari are now on call to provide a self-consciously loopy look at today’s celebrities of the not-so-silver screen. “Look at these stars!” the magazine now appears to mumble, rather hopefully. “You like them?” In a series of eight covers for 2022, which features such other actors as Andrew Garfield, Idris Elba and Penélope Cruz, Cumberbatch’s is the standout. Where Garfield is photographed in goofy neon pink, suspended over Hollywood on a construction hook, and a dreamy Kristen Stewart surveys the city from atop a diving board, a scintilla more art direction appears to have gone into the Cumberbatch shoot. A soapy Benedict stands in a finely appointed room belonging to a Pemberley-style mansion and stares defiantly into the lens while a quartet of handsome swans cavort in and around a gold bathtub. What does the picture signify (apart from being a play on the well-worn “wet fully-clothed movie star” trope)? It’s notable that, in contrast to his surroundings, Cumberbatch is dressed in distinctly modern, action-man togs, while there are touches of distress – some chipped wood in the doorframes – in the antique chamber behind him. Perhaps the photograph is intended as a subversive comment on Cumberbatch’s efforts to distance himself from his extraordinarily moneyed family, whose every generation has its own Wikipedia page going right back to his slave-owning ancestor Abraham Parry Cumberbatch? Certainly it feels as if the UK’s current triumvirate of public school-educated acting superstars, (Cumberbatch, Eddie Redmayne and Tom Hiddleston), have been rather more quiet of late than when they once appeared to dominate the promotional circuits. Indeed, for early students of Cumberbatch’s career – from his stunning Tesman opposite Eve Best in Hedda Gabler in 2005 and his exquisite performance in Stuart: A Life Backwards alongside Tom Hardy in 2007 – a certain level of Cumberbatch fatigue set in after the actor had racked up several Sherlock Holmeses, a Hamlet at the National, the voice of Smaug in three Hobbit films, a Turing and a Julian Assange. Since then, the actor has appeared to scale things back a smidge, keeping a relatively low profile among Marvel gigs with a few cameos and secondary roles before returning to a world that was now more ready for his award-winning turn in Jane Campion’s The Power of the Dog, playing decidedly against type as a gruff and wounded rancher. This tightly coiled, muscular, surly performance seemed also to present a new Cumberbatch, one whose wit and charm had been excised in favour of a more physical charisma, banishing any Englishness from his persona. Although the Hollywood Issue has lost a touch of its pizzazz over the years, it’s interesting to see how, in its depiction of Cumberbatch at least, the magazine has resorted to a type of old-school glamour, playing on notions of money, class and perhaps even race to conjure a vision of ambiguous stardom for 2022 – played out against an empty, dilapidated room.",Arts/Film,Benedict Cumberbatch swans about on the baffling cover of Vanity Fair’s Hollywood issue,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/18/benedict-cumberbatch-vanity-fair-hollywood-issue-cover
2/19/2022,"England have been handed a significant boost before resuming their Six Nations campaign, with Courtney Lawes available to face Wales next Saturday after recovering from a head injury. Lawes has missed England’s first two matches but is on course to return against Wales and comes into the frame for the captaincy. Lawes has not played since mid-January while he has progressed through the head injury return to play protocols. He has been largely restricted to training on his own but the England defence coach Anthony Seibold on Friday confirmed that Lawes took a full part in a full-blooded session.  The 32-year-old’s return will be welcomed by Eddie Jones, who switched Maro Itoje to blindside flanker last Sunday against Italy in Lawes’s absence. During the autumn Lawes captained England in victories over Tonga and South Africa and proved a popular leader among the squad. His presence around the camp, despite being unable to fully train, suggests he will resume the role from Tom Curry, who was captain against Scotland and Italy. Seibold said: “Courtney trained fully today, which is obviously really good news for himself and England. He looked sharp. That was the last box for him to tick. He’s had a very thorough return to play integration and did everything in the session. “I was super impressed with Courtney in the autumn, which was the first time I’d worked with him. He took over from Owen Farrell as captain when Owen got injured and he did a fantastic job. He leads through his actions. One of the things with Courtney is his ability in defence. “Everyone can see his athleticism, but what he does off the ball in defence, the little detail around his effort areas, is very high. Defensively he’s a real leader for us. To have him back in the group training raises the standards because it means we’ve got a highly intelligent defensive player who is full of effort.” England currently sit second in the Six Nations table despite their opening defeat by Scotland and victory over Wales would keep them in contention for the title. Jones has already been boosted by the return to the squad of Manu Tuilagi while Sam Simmonds is set to resume full training on Monday, having sat out this week’s camp to manage an existing hip injury.",Sport/Sport,Courtney Lawes on course to return as England captain against Wales,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/18/courtney-lawes-on-course-to-return-as-england-captain-against-wales
2/19/2022,"Ralf Rangnick has admitted the atmosphere at Manchester United is better after “unhappy players” left in last month’s transfer window. In January the first-team squad members Anthony Martial, Donny van de Beek and Amad Diallo made loan moves. Rangnick, who did not speak of anyone by name, said: “There were players unhappy, the squad was too big, players realised they wouldn’t get game time and the atmosphere is better than it used to be a couple of weeks ago. Now, for us it’s about performing well, showing togetherness on the pitch, winning games and those are the things we can influence.”  The interim manager stated that Harry Maguire, whose form has drawn criticism, would remain the captain. “Harry is our captain and will stay our captain until the end of the season,” Rangnick said. United are in fourth place, two points ahead of West Ham, and travel to Leeds on Sunday before Wednesday’s trip to Atlético Madrid for the Champions League last-16 first leg. Rangnick said he was not prioritising either competition. “We are fully aware the Leeds game is an important one for us, to stay where we are in the table,” he said. “But we have an important one at Atlético Madrid in a competition [where] we would like to proceed to the next round and then we have Watford [in the league]. “We take these one by one and I am grateful we have more players available again. Nemanja Matic is back, is maybe even available for Leeds – but certainly for the next two games after.” Edinson Cavani remains out with groin and stomach problems.",Sport/Football,Rangnick: atmosphere at Manchester United better without ‘unhappy’ players,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/18/ralf-rangnick-manchester-united-atmosphere-better-without-unhappy-players-maguire-continues-captain
2/19/2022,"Just over a year ago, the western system of alliances largely lay in ruins, its confidence sapped by Covid and by a US president who saw Europe as a protection racket, treated Nato with contempt and seemed in mysterious thrall to Vladimir Putin. Six months later, Nato suffered the ignominy of the retreat from Kabul and two months after that it lost Angela Merkel – the former German chancellor who was its last best interpreter of Vladimir Putin’s mind. So as a hinge point in the Ukraine crisis arrives, western diplomats are awarding themselves a sigh of relief that diplomatic and security institutions, atrophied by lack of use, have at last cranked back into life and held together. No one is proposing a victory lap – the situation is too tense and unstable – but there is satisfaction that Putin knows he faces a surprisingly cohesive, even galvanised, western diplomatic effort built on exhaustive consultation and shared analysis.  Whether the Russian president will as a result wager that the long-term price of an invasion of Ukraine is too high seems unknowable until the missiles launch. Merkel herself once said Putin lives in his own world. The only problem is that he makes us all inhabit it as well. So even if it is too early to tidy up events still in flux, it is already clear where the west has succeeded, and may yet fail. Orysia Lutsevych, head of the Ukraine Forum at the Chatham House thinktank, said: “The west has grasped the importance of this moment. Putin may control the narrative, but the west has not turned away.” Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, made a similar point when he said: “What is important is that western countries had been able to agree on what they were confronting. If we had not been able to do that, it would have scared me.” There has not just been a shared analysis, but a sharing of responsibilities. The military deployments to shore up the eastern flank have been quick, including French troops into Romania and US troops into the Baltic states. Many of these deployments may prove permanent, UK officials say privately, an assessment they believe Poland, France and Germany shares – although that would require full Nato endorsement. Intelligence has been used in a new way – if a somewhat “the Russians are coming” one – in a bid to win an information war, signal Putin’s next steps and so block them. Dr Anders Åslund, adjunct professor at Georgetown University, said: “The western strategy – I mean here primarily the US and UK strategy – I think has been just right: expose it all, emphasise as much as possible what is going on, and provide as much intelligence as reasonably can be provided, and by doing so, the west is really pushing Putin into a sort of dead end. Either he goes for everything, and then he is likely to lose, or he is not getting anything.” Putin may also have inadvertently engendered unity. The UK may still – slightly neurotically – harp on about its leadership role, but it has also tried to stop being rude about the European Union. French and British defence ministers, for instance, met bilaterally this week in Brussels, ending their standoff caused by the row over the Aukus pact between Australia, the UK and US. David Miliband, the former foreign secretary, said: “The UK has been trying to run a foreign policy as if Europe did not exist. That is a problem when your closest ally, the object of your ardour, the US, thinks self-evidently the EU does exist.” Boris Johnson even went so far as to congratulate the EU Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, for her cooperation so far over sanctions. The UK has also been forced, in the face of international ridicule, to wake from its slumbers about Russian dirty money circulating in London, going so far as to say that in the event of an invasion Russian firms will be unable to raise capital in London. Differences still exist within the EU over the precise triggers that would launch the sanctions package, but something credible spanning energy and finance is now ready to go, even if it would require Viktor Orbán, the Hungarian prime minister, to withhold his veto. In a concession to the US, Germany has made it understood that Nord Stream 2, the Russian-German pipeline, will not go ahead in the event of an invasion. Even if Scholz did not say as much on his visit to Moscow for legal reasons, US senators came away from private briefings with him the week before, happy with what they heard. Scholz is anyway losing patience with the former chancellor Gerhard Schröder, Putin’s placeman on the Nord Stream supervisory board and an increasing embarrassment to the country’s Social Democratic party. All of this meant at the time of a maximum tension last Friday the US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, was able to give a warning to the Kremlin that rang true. “If Russia proceeds,” he said, “its long-term power and influence will be diminished, not enhanced, by an invasion. It will face a more determined transatlantic community. It will have to make more concessions to China. It will face massive pressure on its economy and export controls that will erode its defence industrial base. And it will face a wave of condemnation from around the world.” But Joe Biden has also made clear the limits of the deterrence he is proposing. To the frustration of Kyiv, he insists the west will help arm Ukraine, but will not intervene militarily or impose sanctions before an invasion. British diplomats acknowledge that the US president has probably read the mood of Americans right on their limits in terms of protecting Ukrainian sovereignty. That is the good news so far, and a rebuff to those only a year ago warned of a “westless world”. For a whole generation of Europeans that have never conceived of a war on their continent, Nato has introduced itself, and has not fallen over. Beneath the surface, the differences linger about the west’s strategy of deterrence, and how best to constrain Putin. Some of it is about little more than emphasis or tone, but it is also the product of geography, national histories and different politics. The British sniffer dogs in Whitehall in particular remain on patrol for the first “whiff of Munich” or appeasement to emerge, ironically, from Berlin. No one denies the difference in outlook between London and Berlin, to take the two most extreme examples. Scholz, for instance, assured Putin that security in Europe was not possible against Russia, “but only with Russia”. He refused to describe the crisis as hopeless, saying: “War in Europe has become unthinkable for my generation.” Politicians must ensure “that it stays that way”. Bilateral economic relations continued to have great potential, Scholz said. Those that criticise the west’s strategy most also point to the pilgrimage of European politicians to Moscow and worry that it only encourages Putin to conclude armoured tanks massed in the right place can bring the level of attention the country’s status and grievances warrant. Putin felt Russia’s demands had been ignored ever since he put them on the table in a speech to the Munich Security Conference in 2007. “What Putin is after, in part, is our full attention. He has certainly succeeded in that,” said Fiona Hill, the former White House Russia adviser. The critics worry that Putin is not only getting leaders running to his door, but results. Coercive diplomacy works. Russia can already point to the revival of the Nato-Russia security council, a body founded in 2002 that had not met for three years. In response to Putin’s unrealistic treaty demands tabled in December, Nato has replied by making formal offers to hold talks on conventional forces, a replacement for the intermediate nuclear treaty as well as proposals on the transparency of weapons. Two distinguished former British diplomats, Roderic Lyne and David Manning, admit this should have happened anyway, writing in a Chatham House report: “Many agreements underpinning European security and strategic stability between Russia and the US have dissolved, so a more stable order would bring obvious benefits to both sides.” But arms reduction, in Putin’s current mood, is a third-tier prize. Ukraine is his real target, and here Putin can claim to have at least forced the west to pay new attention to the frozen conflict in the Donbas. Political directors in the Normandy format – the four-nation body that oversees the Minsk agreements signed at the end of the 2014 conflict in eastern Ukraine – have met twice after not meeting for three years. Little progress was made, but Putin will have detected that Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, long critical of the support he was receiving from Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, has come under private pressure to shift ground on how to interpret those agreements. Scholz brought with him to Moscow from Kyiv firm promises that three legal texts needed for the Minsk process to continue were being prepared in the Ukrainian parliament – on the status of eastern Ukraine, on a constitutional amendment and on the preparation of elections. Putin is maintaining the pressure by describing what has been happening in the east as genocide and by allowing the Russian Duma, by 351 votes to 16, to back a proposal to recognise the people’s republic in the Donbas as an independent state, a move that was quickly condemned by the US State Department as calling into question Russia’s stated desire to return to diplomacy. Putin will also be surveying the cracks in the west’s resolve about Ukraine’s future security status. More and more western politicians and analysts say out loud that Ukraine’s membership of Nato, put on the table at a Nato summit in Bucharest in 2008, was a mistake that raised false expectations and it would be better to admit as much. Scholz told the German press accompanying him to Moscow: “There’s a fact and this fact is that all participants know that Ukraine’s Nato membership is not on the agenda. So everyone should take a step back and be clear that we can’t have a situation where there might be a military conflict over an issue that isn’t even on the agenda.” In saying Ukraine cannot join Nato as long as it has a pre-existing conflict with Russia, as the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, did on the BBC this week, he was stating a fact. But, perhaps inadvertently, he was giving Russia a near veto over Ukraine’s membership. Others, including Sir John Sawers, the former head of M16, propose as “a sensible solution” the possibility of some form of neutrality status for Ukraine akin to Austria’s from 1955. “This issue needs to be finessed,” Manning said. “If the border conflict was settled, and other measures agreed to ensure Ukraine’s independence was no longer under threat, the way would be open for Ukraine to leave its Nato application on the table but commit not to proceed with it within a defined and lengthy period. This would recognise reality without breaching Nato’s principles.” This approach would be hard to sell to Ukraine, where support for Nato membership is rising. But it also presumes Putin is in this for a deal. “The problem is that Russia is contemptuous of Ukraine as an independent state, but also scared of Ukraine as a functioning democratic state that cleaves westward,” Miliband said. Quoting George Kennan, he said: “Russia sees its neighbours either as a threat or a vassal, never as a partner.” Senior serving British intelligence officers also believe Putin is not interested in half measures. These officials say the key text lies less in Putin’s treaty demands – tabled in January and restated this week – but on his essay on the historical unity of the Russians and Ukrainians in July 2021. One British official points to analysis by historian Andreas Kappeler which, they said, not only shows Putin sees Ukraine as an artificial construct, but also gives a glimpse into his mind – one which “mixes Soviet patriotism, imperial and ethnic nationalism, and a blood-and-soil pathos”. The British official said: “There is a visceral emotional, even semi-spiritual attachment around his view of Ukraine. I think if he’s going to do something, which is going to cause him some significant challenge in his relationship with western nations, I think the answer for him is to look at resolving the question on his terms in the first instance, and then dealing with the fallout from there. I don’t see how something smaller, limited to those separatist republics, is enough to resolve the Ukraine question on his terms.” The argument about Putin’s true intentions is not just a parlour game but goes to the heart of the best response, not just now but in the event of an invasion. James Nixey, head of the Russia programme at Chatham House, said: “What is at stake here is a basic grasp of the nature of relations between states in the 21st century. What Russia is insisting on is its right to a land empire which is entirely at odds with the principles of statehood that now govern Europe, and indeed much of the rest of the world. “By failing to address the real nature of Russia’s demands, Europe is avoiding critical decisions that will affect its future security for generations to come. The implications of that avoidance do not only affect Europe – they are global in importance.” Miliband, too, sees something fundamental at stake not just for the west. “The reset seems to be happening now – and of which Putin is an acute form presents a system of disorganised lawlessness that is dangerous,” he said. “It is happening at a time at greater interdependence. The ramifications of system failure in one part of the system is greater than before because the world is hyper-connected. “And we are only at the beginning of this phase of disorganised lawlessness, involving state and non-state actors. We don’t know where we are going to end up.”",News/World news,Ukraine: the crisis that brought the west together,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/18/ukraine-the-crisis-that-brought-the-west-together
2/19/2022,"This week I had my first nightmare about war. In the dream, I woke up to find that Russia had attacked my home city of Kyiv: there was no internet connection, and no way of finding out what had happened. I had this dream on Wednesday, the night on which – according to western intelligence – Russia was most likely to begin its attack on Ukraine. Over the last few months, we Ukrainians have of course considered various scenarios and contingency plans, but mainly we have kept calm. But when the US, the UK and dozens of other states evacuated their embassies from the capital, it felt different.  News headlines say Russia’s advance will begin with an attack on Kyiv. That makes sense. If Moscow wants to gain control of our country, it will want to fracture the calm and resolve of a political, media and business elite which, for the last few years, has lived a perfectly normal European life without needing to think too much about the war miles away on our borders in the Donbas region. Our president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, declared that Wednesday – the supposed day of attack – should be a national day of unity. TV channels (mainly owned by oligarchs and the president’s opponents) showed live programmes featuring familiar faces from across the networks. Some people mocked the whole idea, but for me it worked. Ukraine’s predicted “dire day”, in fact, felt like a holiday: my Facebook feed was full of hearts in our national colours, wishing for peace. But that was largely illusory. Alreadya reported 150,000 Russian troops have been deployed on our border – and another pontoon bridge for military vehicles has been built in Belarus, close to Ukraine, where military drills have been taking place. Two government banks and the defence ministry say they have experienced the most severe cyber-attacks of their kind and have put the blame on Russia for them. Thankfully, they managed to defend themselves. Our army is on high alert, but for the rest of the population, everything connected to this possible incursion forms the backdrop to what is still a kind of ordinary life. This week, as well as filing a dispatch from the frontline, appearing on a TV station, participating in a briefing with US officials and calming down my own family, I have been discussing the launch of a project on public health and a translated Japanese poetry book on Chernobyl, scheduled for publication in the spring. It feels incongruous to be doing the work I would normally do, but it’s how everyone I know is coping. We are not cancelling anything. Fear is inevitable, but panic feels pointless. This refusal to change our lives is not born out of stubbornness or carelessness, nor fatalism or distrust of western sources. We know that what is to come may be long-lasting, and we need to preserve normality and conserve our strength. In a best-case scenario, the threat alerts could be moved each week. In the worst, a full-scale military incursion could occur and fighting could last for months or years. Ukraine is about two-and-a-half times larger than the UK. The terrain is difficult: even a formidable force like Russia can’t take it overnight. And 57% of Ukrainians say they are ready to resist – that number is growing, too. My experience of reporting on the Donbas conflict in the south-east of our country tells me that the Russian strategy of accusing Ukraine of fictional crimes may well continue. At the start of the week, the Russian parliament called on Putin to recognise the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, widely seen as being governed by Kremlin proxies, which he has so far been reluctant to do formally. If Russia did go ahead, it would have dire consequences for the Minsk accords – the peace agreement signed in 2014-15. The full-scale military action would focus on the Donbas, but chaos would be triggered all over the country. Yesterday, on the seventh anniversary of the Minsk accords and as the UN security council discussed the issue and the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, challenged Russia to make an unequivocal statement that it would not invade, artillery shells reportedly hit at least 30 towns on the Ukrainian government-controlled side of the Donbas, damaging a nursery and wounding three people. Predictably, Russians at the UN accused Ukraine of the attack. The west was quick to call the shelling a “false flag”, condemning an operation that seemed an attempt to provide some spurious basis for a Russian attack. But in future, since countries like the US and the UK have already pulled out their observers, there will be fewer eyes on the ground to provide verified data of any such aggression. So what will happen now? That depends not just on Putin’s decision-making (and it’s worth remembering that although a tactician, he is no mean strategist), but also deterrence, and the scale of the response from Ukraine and the rest of the world. The lesson we can take from the occupation of Crimea and Donbas in 2014 was that the perception of weakness only made things worse. To stop Russia, Ukrainians must show, for as long as possible, that we are unconquerable. The start of a full-scale war might not be as obvious as a dramatic visual attack on Kyiv, or the advance of Russian tanks along the border. Instead, it could be those millions of Ukrainians residing in the Donbas who suffer first and suffer most. Compared to that, the uncertainty and fear we feel in Kyiv is something we just have to live with.
