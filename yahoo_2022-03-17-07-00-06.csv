3/17/2022,"A group of international Chinese students from Cornell University staged a walkout and allegedly booed an Uyghur student during a public service career talk last week.

The walkout occurred after Fulbright scholar Rizwangul NurMuhammad spoke during the question-and-answer portion of a talk that was part of a weekly speaker series for the students of Cornell University's Master in Public Administration program on Thursday.

NurMuhammad asked guest speaker Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) about why the U.S. and the international community have spoken up against Russia for invading Ukraine yet remain quiet on the issue of the alleged genocide of the Uyghurs, the most persecuted ethnic minority in China.
 


NurMuhammad said that her brother, Mewlan, was arrested in 2017 during the Chinese government’s crackdown on the Uyghurs in China’s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The student also said that she has not been able to speak to her brother since his detention.

As Slotkin tried responding to NurMuhammad’s question, around 40 Chinese students reportedly walked out, prompting a university staff member to inform the Democrat representative, who joined the event via a video link, about their exit. “We have a lot of the Chinese students exiting the room, congresswoman, just to let you know,” the staff member can be heard saying in a video shared with The Independent.

“I feel for you and I’m sorry that you’re going through that and I’m sorry that the students just felt the need to leave,” Slotkin said to NurMuhammad.

“There was audible booing and jeering from the Chinese students partway through her question, and during the answer, they started to get up and just walked out of the room,"" Pedro Fernandez, a Cornell University student who attended the event, told Axios.

Around 88 students reportedly signed an email that was sent to Cornell Institute of Public Affairs faculty members the following day, explaining that the walkout was due to the “extremely hostile” environment the talk’s Chinese attendees were put in. “At that moment, we were not sitting in a classroom; we were crucified in a courtroom for crimes that we did not commit,” they wrote.

Cornell Institute for Public Affairs Director Professor Matt Hall responded with a faculty-wide email, writing: “The human rights abuses of the Uyghur people are valuable points of discussion and critical to promoting open dialogue. At the same time, we must also respect that walkouts are a legitimate form of protest and an appropriate expression of disapproval.”

Following the incident, NurMuhammad told The Independent that the walkout brought about a “dehumanizing” experience. She claimed that the email Hall sent showed “they were trying to shift the focus of what happened. They have denied my existence, literally.”

“My brother has been arbitrarily for five years, my people are suffering genocide at the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” NurMuhammad added. “When they walked out, the signal they gave me is that your personal suffering is not welcome to be shared in this space. They’re giving me this signal that you have to be silent. This stress and this worry has [sic] accumulated for too long.”

In a follow-up email, Hall and the Dean of the Cornell Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy, Colleen Barry, said the events that transpired last week “spurred divisive discourse and engaged us in serious conversation related to how best to speak up in the face of genocide and human rights atrocities against the Uyghur people.”

“At the same time, they remind us how harmful it is when conversation devolves into derogatory anti-Asian expression,” the statement continued.

Cornell University staff reportedly reached out to NurMuhammad privately, but she noted that their response to the incident was unsatisfactory, and she wants them to publicly apologize.

“You’re talking about anti-Asian? What are you talking about? I’m Asian too. There is very little understanding of what I’m going through. I felt alone,” she said.

A vocal critic of the Chinese government since her brother’s forced detention, NurMuhammad acquired New Zealand citizenship after moving there from Xinjiang in 2010. She moved to the U.S. in 2021 after receiving a Fulbright scholarship to attend Cornell University.

3/17/2022,"By Satoshi Sugiyama and Maki Shiraki TOKYO (Reuters) - A decade after Mazda Motor's cars disappeared from Ford Motor's factory floors in Michigan, the Japanese automaker is once again building in the United States - this time with compatriot Toyota Motor. When the first Mazda CX-50 crossovers rolled off the assembly line at the joint Alabama plant in January, they were packed with efficiencies hammered out by the two automakers, both known for their cost-cutting smarts and manufacturing prowess. For Mazda, restarting local production with help from Toyota's deep local knowledge and reputation for reliability is the game-changer it hopes will jump-start sales in the world's second-biggest market. ""It's a huge advantage for us to be able to learn from Toyota's vast experience in the United States,"" Masashi Aihara, head of Mazda Toyota Manufacturing U.S.A. (MTM), told Reuters in an interview last week. Although the 50-50 venture might seem like a David-and-Goliath partnership, it also provides a glimpse into how Toyota aims to glean fresh skills from its growing number of smaller partners. As competition heats up in the industry - not least from prospective new entrants such as Apple and Sony Group - Toyota has taken minority stakes in Mazda as well as small-car maker Suzuki Motor and all-wheel-drive specialist Subaru Corp in recent years. Aihara, a 38-year veteran of Mazda, said his selection to lead the $2.3 billion, 300,000-units-a-year factory was evidence that the learning was mutual. ""Under President (Akio) Toyoda, Toyota is constantly looking to change the way it does things, and I think (by putting me in this position) he was saying, 'If there's something to be learned from Mazda, learn it.'"" BEST PRACTICES The Huntsville, Alabama factory, which opened last year and is designed to add electric vehicles in future, contains many firsts for Mazda. MTM tows components from on-site suppliers on linked-up tractors, saving time on loading and unloading from trucks. The order in which the vehicles are assembled was also streamlined and machinery standardised as much as possible so Mazda and Toyota cars could eventually be built on the same line. ""There were times when we both realised that we were doing things a certain way purely out of habit,"" Aihara said. ""And in some cases, we came up with a hybrid method bringing in techniques from both sides. That's something we wouldn't be able to do at Mazda proper."" The operation hasn't been without its hitches. A tight labour market has meant the plant is still 900 workers short of the targeted 4,000, keeping it running at one shift instead of two. Mazda wants to boost U.S. sales by about a third to 450,000 by the middle of the decade. An early plan to train six teams at Mazda and Toyota factories in Japan was derailed by COVID-19, the second team forced to cut their trip short. Still, Toyota's U.S. footprint paid off there too: Kentucky and other local plants helped complete training for the rest, Aihara said. ""Ultimately, the No. 1 mission for this factory is to contribute to the growth of our U.S. business,"" he said.

3/17/2022,"Chris Cuomo’s bromance with Don Lemon appears to be completely over, taking an especially ugly turn Wednesday when the disgraced anchor threw his former CNN “brother” under the bus in an effort to extract $125 million from the network. Cuomo demanded the nine-figure sum from CNN in an arbitration filing, claiming damages for breach of contract, lost wages, and what he alleged was an assassination of his character following an unceremonious December firing. In the scorched-earth filing, first reported by Deadline, Cuomo and his lawyers devoted an entire section to lashing out at some of his former CNN colleagues. Under the headline “CNN’s Failure to Enforce Policy Against Other Employees,” Cuomo alleged that the network, under the leadership of ousted lovers Jeff Zucker and Allison Gollust, spared certain talent for ethical violations while firing a bazooka at Cuomo’s career for having helped dig up dirt on the women who accused his brother, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, of sexual misconduct. Among the talent Cuomo took aim at was Lemon, with whom he’d famously shared a close relationship—including Hamptons hangouts, Instagram selfies, a joint podcast, and a near-nightly exchange of “I love yous” during their on-air primetime handoffs. “I love you, brother,” Lemon told Cuomo in August shortly before launching into a segment on the sexual-harassment allegations against Chris’ older brother. “I love you, D. Lemon,” Cuomo replied with a smile. But Wednesday’s filing was nowhere near as warm. “As long as CNN’s ratings would not be hurt, Zucker and Gollust were more than willing to overlook major transgressions by CNN personalities such as Don Lemon and Jake Tapper, or even to engage in blatant misconduct themselves,” it alleged. Cuomo specifically cited how, in November 2021, Empire actor Jussie Smollett testified that Lemon personally warned him that Chicago police didn’t believe his false accusations of a hate crime. Lemon’s consulting with the embattled actor constituted a “flagrant breach of journalistic ethics,” Cuomo’s team wrote. “Intervening in the ongoing investigation by texting Smollett was an inexcusable breach of ethics,” the filing argued. “Yet CNN did nothing; Lemon was not disciplined in any way.” Cuomo’s attempt to drag his one-time pal in order to extract a hefty payout from CNN is perhaps the final blow to a very public, affection-laden friendship. The pair’s nightly on-air “handoff” often generated social media chatter as the pair professed their love for each other and shared anecdotes about their vacations—ultimately leading to a 23-episode CNN podcast literally titled The Handoff and hosted by the two self-described “brothers.” While Lemon has yet to publicly comment on his friend’s firing, he notably struck the first blow last month when he argued in a staff meeting after Zucker’s firing that Cuomo should not be paid any severance. “Did you think about what message it sends to the journalists in this company and to the larger public, that someone can be found to break with those journalistic standards and then get paid handsomely for it?” Lemon grilled WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar during the New York chat, Insider reported. “And what is to stop the next person from possibly getting compensated for it, to spread rumors, or what have you to the press?"" Cuomo also took aim at several other former CNN colleagues allegedly breaching company ethics without punishment. His filing cited how The Lead host Jake Tapper privately suggested Republican congressional candidate Sean Parnell run in a “safer” district instead of against incumbent Rep. Conor Lamb (D-PA). Tapper faced no internal inquiry and faced no repercussions for the action, Cuomo lamented of his former workmate. Tapper, too, had taken a swipe at Cuomo, fretting in private that the former anchor effectively destroyed Zucker’s career by threatening the network following his own ouster. “An outside observer might say, ‘Well, it looks like Chris Cuomo succeeded,’” Tapper said in a D.C. staff meeting with Kilar. “He threatened Jeff. Jeff said we don’t negotiate with terrorists. And Chris blew the place up. How do we get past that perception that this is the bad guy winning?” CNN, Lemon, and Tapper did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In the filing, Cuomo additionally referenced CNN chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin’s scandal where he was caught masturbating during a Zoom meeting with New Yorker colleagues—an act Cuomo described as “a sordid act of sexual harassment” and one for which Toobin was never forced to issue a public apology. When reached by The Daily Beast on Wednesday, Toobin declined to comment. “CNN allowed employees to retain their jobs for offenses much more egregious than anything CNN alleges Cuomo ever did,” Cuomo whined in his filing. “But because Cuomo was so strongly linked to Gov. Cuomo, whose political standing and corresponding value to CNN had turned dramatically, CNN falsely claimed that Cuomo violated its policies and practices as an excuse to terminate his contract. This is the epitome of hypocrisy, as there was no valid basis for terminating his contract.” Read more at The Daily Beast. Got a tip?

3/17/2022,"Another day, another alligator on a Florida golf course. But a big guy last week wasn’t just hanging out on the links in Lakeland. The gator was having a full-on feast — of another gator. An onlooker, Julie Marchillo Smith, posted the video on her Facebook page, writing, “So this happened this morning,” referring to the large reptile as “grandpappy.” ‘Please be cautious.’ A crocodile has taken up residence at a Florida golf course “Oh my God!” a woman screams, as the animal stops briefly on a pathway. “Put that gator down!” “Wow,” says someone else. “This guy is huge,” Smith wrote, estimating the prey’s size at around six feet and the larger apex predator at around 20 feet long. (That’s unlikely as the Florida state record for length is a 14-foot, 3 1/2-inch male from Lake Washington in Brevard County in 2010.) In the comments section, one of the social media user’s friends jokingly asked if she measured the reptiles. He stole a gator from a Florida mini golf course, then went on the attack, cops say “You can figure pretty close based on the size of the road he crossed over and the fact that I was as close as I was going to get,” Smith answered with a laughing face emoji. According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, adult male alligators are known to be cannibals and often kill over territory during mating season, which generally starts in April and runs through June. So this guy got an early start.",U.S./Miami Herald,‘Put that gator down!’ Watch a huge cannibal drag a meal through a Florida golf course,https://news.yahoo.com/put-gator-down-watch-huge-190144928.html
3/17/2022,"Yale history professor Timothy Snyder on Tuesday said Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine will backfire on Russia for years to come. The globally condemned war and resulting sanctions on Russia are pushing it “closer and closer to China,” Snyder, an expert on fascism and authoritarianism, told MSNBC’s Ari Melber. And if Putin “doesn’t let up” on Ukraine, his legacy will not be of re-establishing Russia as a global superpower. Instead, it will be of the country becoming “a vassal state of China,” Snyder predicted, echoing multiple other commentators in recent days. There are “plenty of people in Russia who realize” the war on Ukraine is a moral, economic and geopolitical disaster, said the professor. “The question is whether any of them has the courage to speak the truth to Putin and whether he realizes in time that not just his legacy, but his power is being undermined by what he is doing,” he added.
