1/13/2022,"A German court is expected to issue a verdict against a former Syrian intelligence official accused of overseeing the murder of 58 people and the torture of thousands of others, in a landmark case expected to declare the actions of the Assad regime over the last decade a crime against humanity for the first time. The verdict against Anwar Raslan, a former colonel loyal to the regime who later defected and fled Syria, is both a highly symbolic moment for the Syrian opposition in exile and a potential risk for those seeking to bring more war criminals to justice in the future, some of whom say a harsh sentence could discourage other defectors from talking openly to authorities.  Raslan, 58, is charged with crimes against humanity, rape, aggravated sexual assault and murder at Branch 251, an intelligence unit with its own prison also known as “al-Khatib” after the eponymous neighbourhood in Damascus, where he allegedly oversaw the torture of at least 4,000 people as a commanding officer between 29 April 2011 and 7 September 2012. The former officer is being tried under the legal principle of universal jurisdiction, which allows the prosecution of crimes in one country even if they happened elsewhere. If the court finds Raslan to be guilty, as the main perpetrator rather than just an aide to these crimes, he could face a life sentence on Thursday, with no chance of early release until he has served 15 years. Over 107 trial days at a regional court in the south-western German town of Koblenz, the judge heard statements from almost 50 witnesses who had survived the Branch 251 facility, several of whom appeared as co-plaintiffs. They described how suspects rounded up by the regime were beaten by guards with fists, sticks, cables, and metal pipes, and held in tightly packed cells whose ventilation shafts were intermittently closed to induce panic. “It was always the same cycle,” said the musician Wassim Mukdad when he appeared in front of the Koblenz court in August 2020. “I said something, I was beaten, I said something, I was beaten and so on and so on … They knew exactly where to beat me to cause maximum pain.” Another witness, a former funeral service worker in Damascus, recalled being enlisted by Syrian intelligence to drive its victims to mass graves outside the city – on average four trips a week, each time carrying up to 700 corpses. According to the Syrian Network for Human Rights, a UK-based independent monitoring group, at least 130,000 people have been detained or forcibly disappeared by Bashar al-Assad’s regime since March 2021. Raslan’s defence lawyers have tried to dismiss some of the evidence, arguing that none of the witnesses were directly tortured by the accused himself. The former intelligence official said in court that he had stopped identifying with the Syrian state after 2011, and that as a Sunni from the Houla region he was not trusted by Assad’s mostly Alawite generals. After defecting, he fled to Jordan in 2012 and in 2014 was granted asylum on humanitarian grounds in Germany, where he said he did not try to cover up his past. During the trial, Raslan claimed that after arriving in Germany he lived in fear of retributions from the Syrian regime and contacted Berlin police in February 2015 because he was convinced he was being followed. The police officer who questioned him at the time told the Koblenz court that while Raslan’s fear of retribution was real, she had not considered him to be under real threat in Germany. Germany’s federal criminal police started investigating Raslan in 2017, after he described his role in Syria’s security apparatus in detail during an interview with Stuttgart police, supposedly to aid their investigations into another officer. He was arrested in February 2019.",News/World news,German court expected to accuse Assad regime in Syria of torture,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/12/german-court-expected-to-accuse-assad-regime-in-syria-of-torture
1/13/2022,"Ithink it’s vaguely important to revisit the fact that last week, Romford’s Convervative MP, Andrew Rosindell, took up actual time in parliament – I am loth to describe this time as “precious” or anything, because come on, but it does feel like time spent talking out loud in the House of Commons has some sort of rudimentary value – to ask whether British broadcasters should be playing the national anthem more. “I know the minister will agree that the singing of the national anthem is something that provides great sense of unity and pride in our nation,” Rosindell said, “so in this year of the Queen’s platinum jubilee, will the minister take steps to encourage public broadcasters to play the national anthem and ensure the BBC restores it at the end of the day’s programming before it switches to News 24?” It does make you wonder what people get into the MP-ing gig for, doesn’t it? Clearly, it’s to just get up in front of people and briefly make the most embarrassing suggestion in the world for that day.  So it is worth me taking up some of my completely unprecious time to answer the question. Should we play the national anthem more? No. Should the BBC in particular do it more, because they used to do it all the time up until 1997? No. If you want to hear the national anthem so much, just play it on YouTube or something. That’s what I do whenever I want to hear the stupid songs that mean a lot to me, like Friendly Fires – Paris (Aeroplane Remix). I do not submit the entire country to having to listen to it at midnight. I just play it on YouTube and then shut up. It is a system that works flawlessly. My proclivity for near-eight-minute re-workings of songs that were popular for about two months in 2008 is not the issue, though. The issue is that over the past two years of the pandemic – and sorry to bring that whole thing into it, but it does feel related – the Conservative party has been making strange, creeping, weird, clunking gestures of patriotism, assuming we all want to come along for the ride. Patriotism has never been cool, but in the hands of the current ruling party it has veered towards something particularly un-chic. This patriotism has been ambient – Matt Hancock’s Damien Hirst artwork of the Queen, ever-increasing background union flags with every MP’s appearance on morning TV – but it’s been overt, too. Who can forget the Joy Morrissey MP x British Monarchists Society collab to offer a free portrait of the Queen to every household or office that applied for one? “I think this is a wonderful, patriotic and unifying campaign for our country,” she said at the time, a justification similar to Rosindell’s. I agree it’s hard to be proud of this country after 11-plus years of Conservative rule and we could do with something to bring us together about it, but I’m not sure the answer is a lot of visual and sonic reminders that we are not actually a democracy. Who is patriotism for? If England are doing well at an international tournament I can just about muster up an atom of national pride, but other than that the idea of “Great Britain” rarely moves me. I have a fondness for my country but I wouldn’t ever go so far as to call it a “love” – to love someone you have to respect them. If you’re into RAF flyovers, the Duchess of Cambridge’s birthday portraits, the 2012 Olympics, “Brits doing well at the Oscars”, drone renderings of Captain Tom and sitting on Henman Hill: sure, have a portrait of the Queen in your house, go nuts. But for me, being proud about what country you happen by dumb luck to be born in seems like a waste of spiritual and mental resources. But it’s where this all ends that worries me. I think we should be cautious of too many organised attempts to make us more proud of our country: it feels like a slippery slope that ends with us all having to take Nigel Farage seriously again. If there were a news story about a lawmaker in another country urging the national broadcaster to play its anthem every night, then we would all make overtures about authoritarianism and mind control and be forced to sit through a really long-seeming Spitting Image sketch about North Korea. But because it’s Britain, it lands somewhere between silly and strange, a distracting but thin veil pulled over something harder. What are we supposed to be so proud about? We can’t pass laws banning forms of protest and being vile to refugees with one hand while saluting a portrait of the Queen with the other. Give us a country to be proud of, Andrew Rosindell. Then maybe you won’t have to force us to listen to the special patriotism song in a bid to make us more patriotic.

1/13/2022,"Schools going virtual, airlines canceling flights, pharmacies and testing centers closing temporarily, shelves emptying in grocery stores because of transportation delays, blood donations dropping to crisis levels for the first time ever and the country’s hospitals are becoming stretched. This is the US in the grip of the Omicron variant.  Omicron may cause milder symptoms in some people, but its effects are ricocheting throughout America and creating some of the greatest challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic. “We have supply shortages, we have transportation shortages, that are a result of people being out because of Covid, and especially Omicron being so infectious. And that is obviously limiting the workforce, and limiting the workforce is creating some of the havoc that we’re all experiencing,” said Ezekiel Emanuel, vice-provost at the University of Pennsylvania. Joe Biden has vowed to keep businesses and schools open, but some experts wonder if that’s possible given the nature of Omicron and the lack of adequate measures to combat it. “The economy cannot stay open and schools cannot stay open when so many people are getting sick,” said Margaret Thornton, an educational researcher at Princeton School of Public and International Affairs. “We must take action to slow the spread in order to keep schools running, to keep businesses running,” she said – but much of that action has been slow to happen. In order to control Omicron and future surges, officials need to rely on tried-and-true tactics, from testing to high-quality masks and better ventilation, say some health experts. “We now have tools such as N95 masks, vaccines, treatments and rapid diagnostics to help prevent infection and reduce severity of illness,” said Rick Bright, CEO of the Pandemic Prevention Institute at the Rockefeller Foundation and a former official for the US Department of Health. “However, we need to do more to make them affordable and available to everyone, with clear guidance on when and how to use them most effectively.” Facing an astronomical rise in cases and hospitalizations, health systems have been slammed. Omicron comes on the heels of a devastating Delta wave in the fall and existing staff and supply shortages, with little opportunity to recover. The seven-day average of infections in the US is now running at more than 750,000 cases, far higher than during Delta’s peak. “It was back-to-back,” said Jorge Moreno, assistant professor of medicine at the Yale School of Medicine. “It’s affecting every section of healthcare.” Health workers have spoken out on social media about being asked to volunteer to restock supplies and answer phones, or to volunteer in housekeeping, food service and transportation. One resident physician was reportedly asked to work as a scrub tech – a job they never trained for, and weren’t paid for. Meanwhile, nurses in New York are stretched so thin, there are parts of facilities where no one is scheduled to monitor patients. Hospitals in some parts of the country are allowing staff to continue working with positive cases without isolating at all. In Rhode Island, that policy led to an outbreak among patients. “​​We can have an empty bed, but if there’s not a nurse to manage it or even a doctor to manage it, there’s no way to manage the patient. So we’re really in a crunch,” Moreno said. “We’re bursting right now at the seams” – and since hospitalizations lag by a week or two behind cases, the worst is still to come, he said. Hospitals across the nation may already be more full than official numbers suggest. In Maryland, hospitals are 87% full, according to official reports – but in reality they are closer to or exceeding 100% capacity, according to an analysis. There are also fewer hospitals now than when the pandemic began, particularly in rural areas. In 2020, 19 rural hospitals closed – the most in one year since 2005, when data first began being collected. Omicron is also responsible for staff shortages in nursing homes. That leads to facilities limiting the number of new patient admissions – and a backup in hospitals among patients who could transition to a lower level of care. Child care facilities are also facing rising cases and staff shortages. Daycares were already strained, with some centers losing up to 90% of workers as of December. According to Cindy Lehnhoff, director of the National Childcare Association, “catastrophic” shortages have hit about 80% of centers across the country, leading to closures and long wait lists. Schools have also struggled to remain in-person. “It’s chaos. It’s complete chaos,” Thornton said. In Philadelphia, for example, there are now 98 schools that have gone virtual, she said. “There truly are just not enough grownups who are well enough to be in the building.” Leaders have “gotten the reasoning backwards” on keeping schools open, she said. “This administration has said they prioritize schools because of the economy, in order to get parents back to work. And I think that’s just a really backward approach. We need to prioritize schools because they’re important to kids.” In schools, there are proven ways to reduce the spread of any variant. The measures just need to be taken, Thornton said. These measures include well-run remote options for those who want them in order to reduce classroom sizes and reduce exposure risks. Regular testing, where families opt in instead of opting out, would make a huge difference, as well as providing guidance on what to do if you test positive. Making sure that all students have high-quality masks is also essential, Thornton said. “Keeping schools open and the economy running is very important and a real challenge with so much of society getting sick over the next few weeks,” Bright said. “I believe we can do so safely. However, we need to follow the science, use the tools at our disposal and use the tools we have appropriately.” “​​The reality is that Covid-19 is not going away anytime soon. We need to move from crisis to control,” he said. Bright and Emanuel both outlined steps the administration could take to reach its goals, including measures such as expanding testing, vaccines and medication, and rebuilding trust in public health. “We are going to have a rocky next two or three weeks,” Emanuel said. But if measures can be put in place, it would have an enormous effect. And whatever measures are put in place now will help address future surges, Bright said. “​​I believe the next variant is already lurking among us now, which makes it all the more critical that we get ahead and stop it before it has the chance to spread like Omicron did.”",News/US news,‘The economy cannot stay open’: Omicron’s effects ricochet across US,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/12/us-omicron-cases-effects-schools-supply-shortage-hospitals
1/13/2022,"Pret a Manger is increasing pay for the second time in four months as labour shortages force up wages across the hospitality and retail industries. The coffee shop chain said it was investing more than £9.2m in raising hourly pay from a minimum of £9.40 to £9.80, with more than 6,900 of its 8,500 staff earning at least £10 an hour. That comes after pay was put up 5% to £9.40 an hour in September.  Workers will also be able to earn an additional £1.25 an hour, based on a weekly mystery shopper assessment, up from £1. Pret, which has 550 outlets around the world, said the changes were the biggest increase in pay and benefits in its 36-year history and were the result of its successful transformation strategy since 2020 and “the stronger position the business is now in”. The company said in-store sales were “recovering strongly” last year and, although they had fallen since new government guidance to work from home because of the Omicron variant of Covid-19, new areas of business were doing well. The group’s subscription service, launched in September, is now used more than 1m times a week in the UK and home deliveries are also on the rise. Pano Christou, the chief executive of Pret, said: “We’ve said all along that as our business recovered, we wanted to invest back into our people. Today, as we move into a new phase of our transformation strategy, I’m really pleased we’re in a position to do exactly that.” The boost for workers comes only five months after Pret workers threatened to go on strike after being told the company would cease paying for break times, meaning that someone on an eight-hour shift, including a legally required half-hour break, would receive a pay cut of just over 6% a shift compared with pre-pandemic levels. Pret initially also planned to permanently halve weekly mystery shopper bonuses to 50p an hour but relented after the Guardian revealed the move, prompting a public outcry. The increase is the latest in a string of retail and hospitality pay rises. In September, the rival chain Costa gave its workers a 5% pay rise to £9.36 an hour while Itsu, the Asian-inspired fast food chain, increased minimum hourly pay by 11% to a minimum of £10.40 an hour. Last week, Sainsbury’s said it would increase hourly pay by more than 5% to £10 an hour for its lowest paid shop workers. Aldi will increase minimum hourly rates for shop workers to £10.57 an hour from £9.55 nationally from February, a near 11% rise, and £11.32 in Greater London from £11.07. Next has said it will have to put up the price of its clothing by as much as 6% this autumn as the fashion and homewares retailer expects average wages to rise by more than 5% this year.",News/Business,Pret a Manger to increase pay for second time in four months,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/12/pret-a-manger-increase-pay-labour-shortage-coffee-shop
1/13/2022,"A Manhattan federal court judge ruled on Wednesday that a lawsuit brought by the longtime Prince Andrew accuser Virginia Giuffre can move forward. Giuffre has long said the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his then girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, herself recently convicted of sex trafficking, forced her into sex with Prince Andrew when she was 17.  Giuffre filed a civil suit against Andrew on 9 August last year, using a New York state law that provides a window for survivors of childhood sexual abuse to sue, even if the alleged crimes took place outside the statute of limitations. Prince Andrew vehemently denies the allegations. His lawyers tried to get Giuffre’s lawsuit dismissed on grounds including a $500,000 settlement with Epstein in 2009; an argument that the law under which Giuffre sued was unconstitutional; and the contention that Giuffre’s claims were too vague. Here is what to expect next. Andrew could file for a motion of reconsideration or he could take his appeal straight to the second circuit court of appeals. In that instance, a panel of judges would hear the case. If that didn’t go in Andrew’s favor, he could ask the full second circuit to hear the case or he could immediately ask the US supreme court to hear it. The supreme court would decide if it did. Any appeal would delay proceedings. On 4 January, Kaplan ordered that discovery – “the formal process of exchanging information between the parties about the witnesses and evidence they’ll present at trial” – would continue. “Discovery enables the parties to know before the trial begins what evidence may be presented,” the American Bar Association explains. “It’s designed to prevent ‘trial by ambush’, where one side doesn’t learn of the other side’s evidence or witnesses until the trial, when there’s no time to obtain answering evidence.” Discovery includes depositions and interviews under oath. Both sides could also be subject to subpoenas requiring them to turn over records or documents. Both sides could agree to a settlement that would bring proceedings to a close. On 25 October, Kaplan issued a scheduling order. Expert witnesses must be disclosed by 13 May. Rebuttal witnesses must be disclosed a month later. The order also states that discovery must be complete by 14 July. Both sides have to file a joint pretrial proposal by 28 July. This will include whether either side wants a trial by jury and if so, questions for potential jurors. This in no way means the case will progress according to those deadlines. Mitchell Garabedian has represented victims of sexual abuse for decades, settling more than 2,000 clergy abuse cases. He said: “If the parties decide not to settle … there will be intense litigation in which depositions will take place of Prince Andrew and Virginia Giuffre” as well as witnesses. “The deadlines are a guideline. Usually in these cases, one deposition leads to another unexpected deposition and so on, for both parties. If all parties are acting in good faith, and working diligently, and there’s a reasonable need for an extension of deadlines, judges usually grant those extensions.” Prince Andrew, Garabedian said, “is going to try to show that the allegations are not true, and in order to do so, he is going to use standard discovery tools – such as depositions, production of documents, investigations, speaking to collateral sources. “Ms Giuffre will be doing the same. In addition, she will have to reveal the history of her entire life, since she’s claiming emotional distress. In other words, they’ll be looking at all of her records – involving education, hospitalization, therapy, employment, criminal or lack of criminal records, many many records – and they’ll be speaking to sources who might testify in Prince Andrew’s favor, but who’ve known Ms Giuffre.” Giuffre has been accused of luring at least one victim into Epstein’s orbit. Carolyn, who testified at Maxwell’s trial, said Giuffre brought her to his Palm Beach home. Garabedian said there’s “no doubt” other victims could be deposed in Giuffre’s case either to speak about Giuffre or to speak to “pattern and practice”. “It’s up to the judge if he or she is going to allow that testimony,” Garabedian said, adding that “there will be a lot of filings” involving depositions and possible trial testimony. Lawyers will fight over whether depositions should be permitted, and whether witnesses should be allowed to testify. “I think it would be a serious mistake for Prince Andrew not to testify – he’s a party and if he doesn’t testify it’s an elephant in a room,” Garabedian said. “If he choses just not to testify, then a jury’s going to be wondering why he hasn’t.” If Prince Andrew were called to testify but didn’t show up, his deposition could be used in lieu of live testimony. Garabedian said prosecutors are “very interested” in seeing evidence in civil cases. However, when asked if there was a strong nexus between the Giuffre civil proceedings and any criminal investigation, a longtime defense attorney, Julie Rendelman, said: “I think they’re completely separate. I believe that [Maxwell] is the final piece in terms of criminal charges involving Epstein.” Rendelman pointed out that prosecutors have been investigating Epstein and adjacent persons for some time. “I’m pretty confident prosecutors spent this time evaluating every piece of evidence to see if there is anything else,” Rendelman said. “I think they realized the strongest case is Ghislaine, and that’s what they went for.” Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.
