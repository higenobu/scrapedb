The clip comes courtesy of a 20-year-old Waffle House employee named Nirajah Taylor (@nirajah.t). According to her post, the TikToker has been working at the 24/7 diner chain since she was 16. Federal Reserve raises interest rates for first time since 2018 In her video, Taylor shares photos featuring large stacks of money and checks with tips of up to $100. The clip took many viewers by surprise, although many Waffle House employees jumped in to comment that the job can be surprisingly lucrative. Taylor’s clip is part of an ever-growing trend on the app, in which users post transparently about their jobs and pay. Recently, other TikTokers have shared similar videos, including NFL water boys, notaries and even online trivia hosts. Although Taylor’s post doesn’t specify exactly how much she makes, it does make it clear she’s happy with her situation. She even asked viewers to tag the official Waffle House TikTok account in their comments. While the earnings surprised many users, some said they’d learned firsthand how well the job can pay. “I miss working there,” one user wrote. “Was nothing to make $1,000-$1400 a week.” “I believe this 100%,” another agreed. Rupaul's Drag Race' winner Symone dishes her post-drag skincare secrets: “I know the ppl that work there make good money,” another added. “I be in there drunk tipping like I’m rich all because of the conversation.” Other commenters pointed out that some Waffle House employees earn minimum wage. However, there are countless roles at the company that pay much more than the federal minimum of $7.25 per hour. According to Indeed, the average grill cook makes $12.91 an hour, while the average server makes $13.33. Meanwhile, there are managerial roles that pay salaries averaging close to $60,000 per year. Some TikTokers claimed that the real struggle is learning Waffle House’s “language.” As another viral TikTok recently showed, employees at the chain use a set of secret codes to communicate orders.

4/29/2022,"Local authorities in Canada are investigating an attack that left a 14-year-old student unconscious inside a high school in the city of Richmond.

Janice Xie, a Grade 9 student at Hugh Boyd Secondary School, said a 17-year-old Grade 11 student beat her up in a school corridor and left her with head injuries on Thursday.

The victim said she was going down the stairs during lunchtime when the older student ran after her. He then started punching her and insulting her.

""He called me a homophobic slur. He called me the 'F' slur and said all Asians are ugly and that he hates all Asians,"" Xie was quoted as saying.

She told CTV that prior to the incident, her attacker had never interacted with her.

""He thought I was telling people he liked another girl when I didn't,” she said. “And I don't think I could've known anyways because I've never even spoke [sic] to him at all before that.""

Xie, who was rushed to the hospital for treatment, suffered a concussion. She said the incident made her afraid of returning to school.

The victim’s mother, Jordana Sorensen, rushed to the school after being told that Xie passed out twice after being kicked and punched.

Tim Sorensen, the victim’s father, later learned that their daughter was repeatedly hit in the face as she was lying on the ground until other students intervened. He said local authorities informed him that the alleged attacker would be formally charged with assault.

The incident is currently under investigation by the local Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in Richmond.

According to Cpl. Ian Henderson, the male student involved was apprehended at the scene and released to a legal guardian.

""Due to privacy concerns and the confines of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, Richmond RCMP cannot release further details or the names of those involved,"" Henderson wrote in a statement.

Henderson said details about the suspect were not released to the media in accordance with the Youth Criminal Justice Act, which states that information about a young offender must not be published.

Despite Xie’s fear of returning to school, she said she has been receiving support from friends and school counselors.

""Even though I was scared to go back, my friends made me feel better,"" Xie shared. ""Everyone was texting me… they all comforted me and said I can stay with you the whole day if you want and [they'll] walk me to class and they'll just stick by my side.""

David Sadler, director of communications for the Richmond School District, released a statement to CBC noting that the school board is aware of its responsibility to foster a ""positive climate and a safe, healthy environment.""

Sadler also wrote that every member of their school’s community must act in an ""ethical, lawful manner that demonstrates respect"" for others.

A family friend, Susan Tran, has launched a campaign on GoFundMe to help fund Xie’s “trauma counseling, medical and physical therapy.” According to Tran, a portion of the raised amount will be used to help her and her family “get justice for this horrendous act.”

4/29/2022,"PARIS (Reuters) - Air France pilots who reported their Boeing 777 was failing to respond while preparing to land earlier this month simultaneously pulled the controls in opposite directions, French investigators said. Flight 11 was on final approach to Paris Charles de Gaulle airport with 177 passengers onboard after a six-hour trip from New York when the landing was abruptly aborted on April 5. In a radio exchange circulated on the Internet, a pilot was overheard in the background exclaiming ""stop, stop"" and the captain told the tower the jetliner was ""all over the place"". In a preliminary report, France's BEA air accident investigation agency said the two pilots ""simultaneously made inputs on the controls"" during a go-around for a second attempt. The agency has classified the event as a ""serious incident"", an industry term meaning it could have resulted in an accident. ""The captain held the control column in a slightly nose-down position while the co-pilot made several, more pronounced, nose-up inputs,"" the report said. ""Our crew are trained and regularly rehearse procedures that are practised by all airlines,"" Air France said. Boeing declined comment. The Boeing 777 is equipped with control columns that move in sympathy with each other to aid co-ordination. Experts say only one pilot is usually expected to be actively flying at a time. If opposing forces on the two columns pass a certain limit, the link between them is deactivated or ""desynchronised"" to prevent accidents in the case of one side getting jammed. After the landing scare, the pilots analysed the situation but did not notice that they had made contradictory inputs nor that the columns had become decoupled, the BEA said. The plane landed safely on a second attempt and resumed service just over two weeks later, according to FlightRadar24. The BEA said ""no anomaly was observed on the aeroplane"" but added that it was continuing to analyse data. Its investigations are designed to prevent accidents rather than apportion blame. About 20% of accidents take place on approach or landing, more than any other flight phase, according to Airbus data.

4/29/2022,"ALENA MAZURENKO - WEDNESDAY, 27 APRIL 2022, 17:39 Commander of the 36th Separate Marine Brigade of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Sergei Volynsky (Volina), in a new video message, requests an ""extraction"" procedure for the defenders of Mariupol, following the example of the operation in Dunkirk in 1940. Source: Volynsky's Facebook page Quote: ""For 62 days we have been conducting combat operations in complete encirclement, we are currently located at the Azovstal plant and are carrying out tasks together with the units of the Azov Regiment and other units that are surrounded ... There are more than 600 wounded guys of varying conditions in our group, they really need medical help, there are horrendous conditions, no treatments, no personnel who could help them. Also, civilians are injured, and we are providing assistance to them as much as we can. With us are hundreds of civilians, dozens of children, many people with disabilities, the elderly. The situation is difficult, there are problems with water."" Details: Volynsky reiterated that he was appealing to world leaders and diplomats so that the defenders of Mariupol would be heard and so that they would apply an ""extraction"" procedure, following the example of Operation Dynamo (Dunkirk operation, Dunkirk evacuation) during World War II. This is when, in 1940, the military of Britain and France were surrounded by German troops and blockaded in the area of &#8203;&#8203;the city of Dunkirk. The troops that had amassed on the coast were threatened with disaster, but Hitler ordered the offensive be stopped and ""not to approach Dunkirk closer than 10 km"". Winston Churchill, in a famous speech in 1940, called the events at Dunkirk a ""miracle"". More than 300,000 French and British soldiers were evacuated during the rescue operation. Quote: ""Today my main message is: save the ""Mariupol"" garrison. Apply the ""extraction"" procedure to us. It's not 1940, it's 2022. People will simply die here. The wounded will die, and the living will die in battle, civilians are dying here with us in bunkers, private houses and high-rise buildings, where they are simply being shot."" Volynsky added that the defenders of Mariupol hope for help. Background : Earlier, Ukrainian intelligence reported that it had information that the Russian authorities were planning to send units of the National Guard and the FSB to storm the positions of Ukrainian defenders at Azovstal. Ukrainian fighters reported that during the night of 26 April, 35 airstrikes were carried out against Azovstal, civilians were injured and they are under rubble At a meeting with Putin, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said that the invaders had taken control of Mariupol, and then added that Azovstal was controlled by Ukrainian defenders. Putin said on camera that there was no need to storm the plant, but after that the shelling of Azovstal only intensified. President Volodymyr Zelensky argues that the Ukrainian forces still lack the funds to carry out a military operation to remove the blockade on Mariupol. On 23 April, the Azov Regiment posted the first part of a video from the cellars of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol, which was blockaded by the enemy, showing children hiding from Russian bombs. On 24 April, the ""Azovists"" released a new video from the Azovstal bunkers and tunnels. On it, women hiding with children in a shelter said that they had only a few days left of water and food supplies.",World/Ukrayinska Pravda,Following the example of Dunkirk: the fighters of Mariupol ask for a procedure that even Hitler agreed to in 1940,https://news.yahoo.com/following-example-dunkirk-fighters-mariupol-143900745.html
4/29/2022,"Russian President Vladimir Putin ominously warned on Wednesday that if any other country intervenes in Ukraine, Russia will respond with “instruments… nobody else can boast of, and we will use them if we have to.” In recent days, Russian state media has been hyping up the same rhetoric, bombarding audiences with jarring declarations that World War III is imminent. Every major channel is promoting the idea of an inevitable, never-before-seen escalation over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which is being portrayed as a war waged against the Kremlin by the collective West. Patriotic citizens are now being primed for the idea that even the worst outcome is a good thing, because those dying for the motherland will skyrocket to paradise. During Tuesday’s broadcast of 60 Minutes, Vladimir Avatkov of Russia’s Diplomatic Academy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered an Orwellian perspective of current events. “What is happening right now is not about Ukraine, but about the future world order, which has no room for hegemony and where Russia can’t be isolated.” Host Olga Skabeeva described a summit hosted by the U.S. in Germany that day to discuss upping Ukraine’s defense capabilities as a sign that this is indeed “World War III, no longer just a special operation, with 40 countries against us. They declared a war.” Portraying global opponents of Russian aggression as evil incarnate, political scientist Mikhail Markelov claimed: “The representatives of those 40 different countries are today’s collective Hitler.” Later the same day, on The Evening With Vladimir Solovyov, host Vladimir Solovyov lamented the West’s refusal to heed the Kremlin’s warnings. “If they decide to support Ukraine—even though [Russia’s Foreign Minister] Sergey Lavrov told them that this could lead to WWIII—nothing will stop them. They’ve decided to play it big... These are the bastards with no morals.” Head of RT Margarita Simonyan added: “Personally, I think that the most realistic way is the way of World War III, based on knowing us and our leader, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, knowing how everything works around here, it’s impossible—there is no chance—that we will give up.” In perhaps the most shocking declaration about a nuclear holocaust delivered on Russian television in recent months, Simonyan concluded that the idea “that everything will end with a nuclear strike, to me, is more probable than the other outcome. This is to my horror, on one hand, but on the other hand, with the understanding that it is what it is.” Solovyov chimed in: “But we will go to heaven, while they will simply croak.” Simonyan comforted the audiences by adding: “We’re all going to die someday.” Once the conversation turned to Western arms deliveries to Ukraine and a series of fires and explosions on Russian territory, Solovyov pondered out loud: “What is preventing us from striking the territory of the United Kingdom, targeting those logistical centers where these arms are being loaded?” Andrey Sidorov, deputy dean of world politics at Moscow State University, retorted that rather than strike the U.K., Russia should target the real mastermind: America. He specified: “If we decide to strike the U.K., we should rather decide to strike the United States… Final decisions are being made not in London, but in Washington. If we want to hit the real center of the West, then we need to strike Washington.” Attacks Begin in New Country as Russia Warns Nuclear Threat Is ‘Real’ In a bizarre attempt to soften the blow of Russia’s grim predicament, state TV host and media personality Dmitry Kulikov told audiences that war is sometimes “inevitable.” “This is a big war. The West declared it against us. It’s being waged through different methods, never seen before, but there’s never been as many nuclear weapons in the world either,” he said. “That is the only thing that sets this war apart from all others. This is a historical event, something we’re used to. Let’s be worthy of our predecessors, everyone who lived through that. What made us think that our lives should be better than those of our grandparents? Why should we be free of our historical mission?” Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova appeared on the same program and continued with the same hard line. Solovyov asked her: “How far is the West ready to go?” Without hesitation, Zakharova replied: “They’ll go as far as they’re allowed to. If they aren’t stopped, they will go all the way.” Adding his two cents to the nuclear apocalypse sideshow on Wednesday was military expert and retired Colonel Yury Knutov. “I’ve been observing the American approach from its top levels of leadership towards Russia for several years now,” he said on the state TV show 60 Minutes. “For some reason, they believe that Russia can be choked for as long as it takes, until it surrenders, and Russia will never respond or use its nuclear weapons or its nuclear potential… They themselves are creating the situation when there is a threat to the existence of our nation and our military doctrine prescribes that it gives us the right to use nuclear weapons.” Throughout the program, close-up photographs depicting dead Ukrainian servicemen were repeatedly shown on the screen. Knutov praised the production choice. “We see the Ukrainian land flooded by corpses of Ukrainian soldiers and National Guardsmen… our media needs to be showing more of that.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

4/29/2022,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's government does not plan to hold a referendum if its parliament decides to proceed with an application for NATO membership, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said on Friday. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has forced both Sweden and Finland to review long held beliefs that military neutrality is the best means of ensuring national security, with both countries expected to make a decision in the coming few weeks. Andersson said that a referendum was a ""bad idea"". ""I don't think it is an issue that is suitable for a referendum,"" she told reporters. ""There is a lot of information about national security that is confidential, so there are important issues in such a referendum that cannot be discussed and important facts that cannot be put on the table."" Sweden's parliament is reviewing security policy with a report expected in mid-May. Separately, Andersson's own party, the Social Democrats, are looking at whether to drop their objections to NATO membership. With a majority in parliament backing membership, the ruling Social Democrats are seen as the biggest hurdle to Sweden applying to join the 30-nation alliance. The leader of the Moderates, the biggest opposition party, has also rejected calls for a referendum on the issue. ""Voters ... are not naive about Russia,"" Ulf Kristersson told daily Aftonbladet earlier this week in a debate with Left Party leader Nooshi Dadgostar. ""It's very clear that Swedish voters have understood what happened on 24 February and have drawn their conclusions."" Dadgostar, whose party opposes NATO membership, told Aftonbladet that Swedes should get a say in the decision. ""This .. has to go back to the voters, there has to be very strong democratic support in this question,"" she said. Sweden holds a general election in September. An opinion poll by Demoskop in daily Aftonbladet published on April 20 showed 57% of Swedes in favour of joining NATO, up from 51% in March.

4/29/2022,"Amber Heard pledged to donate $3.5 million of her divorce settlement with Johnny Depp to the ACLU. The ACLU's COO and general counsel testified Thursday the organization received only $1.3 million. He said the nonprofit believed $500,000 of the sum came from Elon Musk, whom Heard dated after Depp. When Johnny Depp and Amber Heard reached a settlement in their divorce in 2016, Heard announced that she would donate the entirety of her $7 million payout to charity. She said the money would be split between two organizations: the American Civil Liberties Union and Children's Hospital Los Angeles. But the ACLU said it never received the full $3.5 million it was promised and believed about half the donations it received in Heard's name came from Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla whom Heard started dating after her breakup with Depp. Terence Dougherty, the general counsel and chief operating officer of the ACLU, spoke about Heard's donations to the nonprofit in a prerecorded deposition played on Thursday in Depp's defamation trial against Heard. Depp has accused Heard of ruining his reputation and career by insinuating that she had been the victim of domestic violence in a 2018 Washington Post op-ed. Heard has denied Depp's defamation allegations and says he physically assaulted her on multiple occasions before and during their marriage. Dougherty said the ACLU received four donations in Heard's name, which totaled $1.3 million. Only one of those payments was from Heard directly: a payment for $350,000 in August 2016. The other payments were a $100,000 check from Depp, $500,000 from a donor-advised fund at Vanguard, and $350,000 from a donor-advised fund at Fidelity. Dougherty said the ACLU believed the $500,000 Vanguard payment was from a fund set up by Musk. Musk had emailed Anthony Romero, the executive director of the ACLU, indicating that Heard would donate the total $3.5 million over a 10-year period, Dougherty testified. ""Amber, I described your plan to donate $3.5 million to the ACLU over the next 10 years as you very much believe what you were doing,"" Musk wrote in an email sent to Romero in August 2016. Heard hasn't donated the rest of the money, and she never signed a pledge form that ACLU staffers prepared for her, Dougherty said. Heard asked the ACLU not to issue a press release about her $3.5 million pledge, Dougherty testified. In 2019, when the ACLU expected the next installment, it never came, he said. ""We reached out to Heard starting in 2019 for the next installment of her giving, and we learned that she was having financial difficulties,"" Dougherty said. Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the donation in Heard's name. A representative for Heard also didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. Within months of Depp and Heard's split in May 2016, rumors started to swirl about her dating Musk. In text messages shown in court on Wednesday, Heard acknowledged to her former agent that she never really loved Musk. Reports that they had broken up came out in August 2017. In December 2018 on the same day Heard's op-ed in The Washington Post was published, Heard announced she had taken on a role as an ACLU ambassador on women's rights. ACLU lawyers — including David Cole, the national legal director who has argued before the Supreme Court numerous times — had helped draft the op-ed, Dougherty testified. After Twitter announced on Monday that it reached a deal for Musk to purchase the platform for $44 billion, the ACLU described the billionaire as ""one of our most significant supporters"" but said people should be anxious over the prospective effects of his ownership. ""We should be worried about any powerful central actor, whether it's a government or any wealthy individual — even if it's an ACLU member — having so much control over the boundaries of our political speech online,"" Romero said in a statement.

4/29/2022,"ROME (AP) — With a round of “Happy Birthday” in Italian and English, the U.S. Army toasted an Italian woman with a birthday cake Thursday to replace the one that U.S. soldiers ate as they entered her hometown during one of the final battles of World War II. Meri Mion, who turns 90 on Friday, wiped away tears as she was presented with the cake during a ceremony in Vicenza, northwest of Venice. The event marked the anniversary of the day the 88th Infantry Division fought its way into the city on April 28, 1945. According to the U.S. Army, Mion spent that night with her mother hiding in the attic of their farm in the nearby village of San Pietro in Gù. Retreating German soldiers had fired on the house, but when Mion awoke on the morning of her 13th birthday, American soldiers were nearby. In a statement, the U.S. Army Garrison Italy said Mion’s mother baked her a birthday cake and left it on the windowsill to cool. But it disappeared — apparently nicked by hungry American soldiers who had already been feted by grateful Italians with wine and bread as they entered Vicenza along its main thoroughfare. Mion seemed genuinely surprised that U.S. soldiers had returned the cake 77 years later. She marveled “Mama mia” and “Grazie” as a small crowd featuring U.S. commanders and Italian officials sang “Happy Birthday.” “Tomorrow, we will eat that dessert, with all my family remembering this wonderful day that I will never forget,” Mion said, according to the U.S. Army.",U.S./Associated Press,US Army 'returns' cake to Italian woman for 90th birthday,https://news.yahoo.com/us-army-returns-cake-italian-160640343.html
4/29/2022,"A now-viral video shows a man seemingly trying to stop Olympic gold medalist skier Eileen Gu from leaving after they take a selfie together in Beijing.

The 18-year-old athlete, who often jogs around the city’s streets, was accompanied by her mother riding a bicycle at the time of the incident, which occurred on Chaoyang Road.

The man, who goes by Dong Bei Xing Ge on Douyin, received backlash on Chinese social media after the clip of his encounter with Gu became widely circulated online.

Social media users criticized the man and called him “rude” for not letting the athlete walk away after she took a photo with him.

The man uploaded a video to Douyin on Monday and explained that he just wanted to remind Gu “to be mindful of road safety.” He also claimed that he asked Gu’s mother for permission before he took the selfie.

“I am a loyal fan of Eileen Gu,” the man said. “I didn’t try to stop her from leaving. There happened to be a vehicle coming when she tried to cross the road. I asked her to be mindful of road safety. I definitely didn’t intend to hold her back.”

According to the man, he was excited after taking a selfie with the popular athlete. He then asked social media users to stop criticizing him about their interaction.

Gu, who won two gold medals and a silver medal at the Beijing Winter Olympics in February, is now a beloved celebrity in China. She is affectionately known to her fans as the “Snow Princess” and reportedly lets them take photos with her in public often.

4/29/2022,"NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter on Mars snapped new images of spacecraft debris on the red planet. But it wasn’t aliens. The images, snapped earlier this month from a height of 26 feet, show the dust-covered cables that connected the backshell to the supersonic parachute used during last year’s nail-biter landing. This image of Perseverance's backshell (left of center) and supersonic parachute (far right), was collected from an altitude of 26 feet by NASA's Ingenuity Mars Helicopter on April 19, 2022. (Photo: NASA/JPL-Caltech) The cable appears to be intact, the space agency said. “The backshell and parachute helped protect the rover in deep space and during its fiery descent toward the Martian surface,” NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory said in a news release. Cables emerge from the backshell to the supersonic parachute that brought the Ingenuity helicopter and Perseverance rover to Mars. (Photo: NASA/JPL-Caltech) NASA said the debris field is the result of the backshell and parachute hitting the Martian surface at a speed of 78 mph after it released the Perseverance rover, which landed much more gently via a rocket-powered descent. “The canopy shows no signs of damage from the supersonic airflow during inflation,” NASA said. Only about a third of the 70-foot wide parachute is visible in the images: The supersonic parachute. (Photo: NASA/JPL-Caltech) NASA said analysis of the images could help provide insight for future missions to Mars. “Perseverance had the best-documented Mars landing in history, with cameras showing everything from parachute inflation to touchdown,” Ian Clark, former Perseverance systems engineer and current Mars Sample Return ascent phase lead, said in a news release. “But Ingenuity’s images offer a different vantage point. If they either reinforce that our systems worked as we think they worked or provide even one dataset of engineering information we can use for Mars Sample Return planning, it will be amazing. And if not, the pictures are still phenomenal and inspiring.” The plutonium-powered Perseverance, NASA’s biggest and most advanced rover on Mars, will hunt for signs of life in an area scientists believe was once a river delta. It will also take samples, seal them in tubes and leave them to be collected and brought back to Earth by a future mission.

David Calhoun said “it was a public negotiation” and “we took some risks” in accepting a fixed-price contract that made Boeing responsible if it cost more than expected to convert two Boeing 747 jumbo jets into presidential planes. “Air Force One I’m just going to call a very unique moment, a very unique negotiation, a very unique set of risks that Boeing probably should not have taken,” Calhoun said Wednesday, “but we are where we are, and we’re going to deliver great airplanes.” Calhoun commented on the planes when an analyst asked him about the matter during a call to discuss Boeing’s first-quarter earnings results. The company lost $1.2 billion and took a $660 million write-down for Air Force One. The former private jumbo jet of heavy metal heroes Iron Maiden has landed at Cotswold Airport for its final journey as it is about to be scrapped. 

Famously known as Ed Force One, named after the Eddie mascot of the British band, the aircraft took the band around the globe on countless world tours. 

The band stopped using the plane a few years back though and now it's time for the Boeing 747 to be dismantled. Iron Maiden however, show no signs of slowing down, they're actually currently on tour again. Calhoun was on the board but he was not CEO when Boeing agreed to the $3.9 billion deal with the White House in 2018, and when it took a fixed-cost contract to build a new military training jet, which Boeing just wrote down by $367 million. “Yes, they were written off the day we took them, knowing that we would be investing a fair amount of our own money” in the planes, Calhoun said. Back in 2018, Boeing tweeted that it was “proud to build the next generation of Air Force One, providing American presidents with a flying White House at outstanding value to taxpayers.” The Trump White House said the deal would save taxpayers more than $1.4 billion. The jets are being outfitted with advanced communications equipment, work spaces, sleeping areas and other features that make it a flying office for the president. The work is taking place in San Antonio, Texas. Boeing sued a subcontractor that it blamed for delays last year. On Wednesday, Boeing officials said the pandemic and supply-chain issues have also slowed the work. It's unclear what the planes will look like. Trump took a keen interest in the planes and even promoted his own paint job which is still displayed on Boeing's website. However, many purists have called for keeping the current livery, which dates to the time of President John F. Kennedy. Air Force officials said last fall that no decision had been made. Boeing promised to deliver the planes by December 2024 under a contract negotiated by then-CEO Dennis Muilenburg, who was fired in late 2019 in the fallout from two deadly crashes of Boeing 737 Max jets. Calhoun said he doesn’t want any more fixed-price contracts.",Business/Associated Press,Boeing CEO laments deal with Trump for Air Force One planes,https://news.yahoo.com/boeing-ceo-laments-deal-trump-183927650.html
4/29/2022,"A celebrity chef said managers at American Airlines encouraged him to make sexual advances toward the flight attendant he is accused of sexually assaulting, according to testimony Wednesday at a Fort Worth civil trial. The jury trial against American Airlines began Monday in the 342nd Judicial District Court under Judge Kimberly Fitzpatrick. Kimberly Goesling, who worked for the airline for 30 years, says American Airlines retaliated against her when she reported to Human Resources that Mark Sargeant, a celebrity chef hired by American Airlines, assaulted her on a work trip to Germany in 2018. Goesling filed a lawsuit against American Airlines in 2020. The suit says American Airlines, through its employees, are responsible for the alleged assault. Much of Wednesday’s testimony centered on whether managers on the trip encouraged Sargeant to go to Goesling’s room, where she says the man forced his way into her room, pushed her onto the bed and assaulted her. Sargeant testified via a pre-recorded interview. After his hour-and-a-half long testimony, former American Airlines manager Brett Hooyerink took the stand. In Monday’s opening statements, Goesling’s attorney, Robert Miller, said American Airlines managers got Sargeant drunk, gave him Goesling’s room number and encouraged him to pursue her. The airline’s lawyer, Russell Cawyer, said Monday that there is no evidence American Airlines officials are responsible for Sargeant’s alleged actions. Sargeant, who lives in the United Kingdom, has not spoken publicly about the sexual assault accusation. He has not been criminally charged. The chef worked with Gordon Ramsay for 13 years, has made multiple TV appearances and opened a string of restaurants and bars. American Airlines hired Sargeant as an independent contractor to work on menus for first-class and business class passengers. He joined a group of American Airlines empoyees, including Goesling and Hooyerink, on the trip to Germany to work on the menu. In his video testimony, Sargeant said the night began at a German restaurant, where American Airlines paid for dinner. Sargeant ordered a stein of beer. He asked Goseling to take a video of him on her cell phone and to text it to him, which he said is how he came to have her phone number. After they finished eating, the group went to the hotel bar. Sargeant says he, Hooyerink, American Airlines manager Russell Brown, Goesling and another American Airlines employee started drinking together. He described it as an “alcohol-filled evening” in which he, Hooyerink and the other employee took Jägermeister shots together. Hooyerink later disputed this and said he personally did not get drunk and did not take shots with Sargeant. In the lawsuit, Goesling said she went to up to her room to go to bed while the others continued drinking. In his testimony, Sargeant said he did not pay for his drinks and does not know who did. According to Sargeant, he was not interested in Goesling sexually or romantically until Hooyerink “put the idea into my head.” According to Sargeant, Hooyerink told him that Goesling was attracted to Sargeant and that she “was up for it.” Sargeant testified he decided to go to Goesling’s room, uninvited, because “I thought there was a mutual attraction, and I wanted to take it further.” During the trial, Sargeant and Goesling’s text messages from that night were shown to the courtroom. At 1:38 a.m., Sargeant texted Goesling and said, “my room?” In follow-up texts he again asked her to “come to my room” but indicated he wasn’t there yet — “I will let you know when I’m back.” At 2:03, he texted her “Hey,” twice and called her multiple times. In his testimony, Sargeant said he does not remember doing this. At 3:30 a.m., Sargeant pounded on her door. Goesling opened her door and Sargeant came inside. Sargeant said the two talked and he tried to kiss her, but she made it clear she was not interested. According to the lawsuit, Sargeant forced himself on and sexually assaulted Goesling. While Sargeant says he did go to her room uninvited and try to kiss Goesling, he denies he assaulted her. According to his testimony, the two had a conversation after he tried to kiss her during which she told him she was flattered but she was not interested. He said he apologized and left the room. In his testimony, Sargeant said what happened in the hotel room was “extremely hazy” and he did not remember where he got Goesling’s room number. Sargeant kept texting Goesling after he left her hotel room. In a text at 3:48 a.m., Sargeant texted her and said,” I’m destroyed.” In texts from 3:53 a.m. to 3:57 a.m., Sargeant texted, “But I want you so much.” “Come to my room.” “Please.” “Please.” He also texted her that he wanted to engage in inappropriate sexual acts with her and said he “felt her” and “I want more.” During court testimony, Miller asked Sargeant about the text that he “felt” Goesling. In response, Sargeant said he meant he felt an emotional connection with her, not that he physically touched her. The next morning, Sargeant sent Goesling a series of texts in which he wrote he had too much to drink the night before and he “was acting like a drunken idiot.” “But well done for resisting,” Sargeant texted her at 9:47 a.m. In court testimony, Goesling’s attorney asked Sargeant what he meant by that text. “As corny as it sounds,” Sargeant said in his testimony, “I meant for resisting my charms.” In one text to Goesling, Sargeant said: “I was encouraged. Naming no names.” In February 2018, Goesling reported the alleged assault to American Airlines human resources. Sandra Lauro, an American Airlines investigator, testified in court Tuesday about her investigation into Goesling’s complaint. Lauro said that there was a “preponderance of evidence that (Goesling) was victim to unwelcome sexual advances” from Sargeant. Sargeant’s contract was terminated with American Airlines. According to Lauro’s notes from her investigation, Sargeant told Lauro that he “was egged on” by American Airlines managers that night. He told Lauro did not know how he got Goesling’s room number. During his testimony Wednesday, Sargeant said someone who worked at the hotel — not an American Airlines employee — provided him with Goesling’s number. Hooyerink, who worked at American Airlines for 19 years, testified in person in the Tarrant County courtroom Wednesday. In this case, Miller said in his opening statements, Hooyerink and his actions represent the actions of American Airlines. If American Airlines managers got Sargeant drunk and encouraged him to pursue Goesling, Miller said Monday, the airline is responsible for what happened to her. Hooyerink explained he was on the work trip as the manager of international menu design for the airline. He said he was offered another job in Dallas-Fort Worth in 2019 and no longer works for American Airlines. Hooyerink disputed much of Sargeant’s testimony. Hooyerink said he did not get drunk with Sargeant the night of Jan. 19, 2018, and that he actually went to sleep before Goesling did. He said he did not encourage Sargeant to pursue Goesling or tell Sargeant that Goesling was attracted to him. Miller pointed out that during Hooyerink’s initial deposition — testimony that happens out of the courtroom — Hooyerink was asked if he encouraged Sargeant to pursue Goeseling. During that deposition, Hooyerink had replied, “I can’t rule it out.” “At the time, I said I couldn’t rule it out,” Hooyerink said Wednesday “But I deny it now.” When Miller asked why Hooyerink’s answer changed, Hooyerink said the “context of Mark Sargeant’s recollection has changed.” During the trial Wednesday, Miller wrote the words, “I can’t rule it out” on a piece of paper and displayed it on a projector for the courtroom. Hooyerink said he did believe Goesling was “very friendly with Sargeant that night” and his “perception was that she was attracted to Mark Sargeant.” But, Hooyerink reiterated Wednesday, he did not encourage him to pursue her. Later in the night Jan. 18, Hooyerink said he also heard banging on a door out in the hallway. His hotel room was next door to Goesling’s, although Hooyerink said he did not know that at the time. Hooyerink said he heard a door open in the room next to his and heard conversation, but then he fell back to sleep. When American Airlines’ attorney, Russell Cawyer, questioned Hooyerink, he emphasized Hooyerink was a low-level manager when he was employed at the airline. On Monday, Cawyer said in opening statements that American Airlines is not responsible for the actions of an independent contractor. He and American Airlines are not in court to defend Sargeant’s actions, Caywer said, but “we are defending the accusation that American Airlines aided and abetted” him.",U.S./Fort Worth Star-Telegram,Celebrity chef accused of sexual assault says American Airlines managers ‘egged him on’,https://news.yahoo.com/celebrity-chef-accused-sexual-assault-212836659.html
4/29/2022,"A leading Kremlin mouthpiece has warned that the West’s overt backing for Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory could lead not to Russia’s defeat but to the “total annihilation” of Ukraine. The warning from Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of the propaganda outlets RT and Sputnik, came after further Ukrainian strikes overnight on the border city of Belgorod, a key supply center for Russian military forces in eastern Ukraine. “Explosions and air defense sirens in Belgorod,” Simonyan wrote early Thursday in a message on Telegram. “The Anglo-Saxons publicly encourage Ukraine to take their hostilities into Russian territory. And they give them means to carry that plan out. “What choice do you leave us, idiots? The total annihilation of what remains of Ukraine? A nuclear strike?” In Putinist circles the term “Anglo-Saxons” can be used as a bit of a catch-all for malign Western influences, but there appeared to be little doubt that Simonyan’s message was referring to Britain. British defence minister James Heappey prompted outrage in Moscow earlier this week when he said he thought it was “completely legitimate” for Ukrainian forces to strike against targets in Russia and it was “not necessarily a problem’” if they used weapons donated by Britain. The British military has actively trained Ukrainian forces since Russia annexed Crimea and sent special forces into eastern Ukraine in 2014. The U.K. has also supplied large amounts of arms, including valuable mobile anti-tank weapons. In an interview with Times Radio, Heappey said: “Ukraine was a sovereign country that was living peacefully within its owner borders and then another country decided to violate those borders and bring 130,000 troops across into their country. “That started a war between Ukraine and Russia, and in war Ukraine needs to strike into its opponent’s depth to attack its logistics lines, its fuel supplies, its ammunition depots, and that’s part of it.” Putin himself got in on the threat in a speech to lawmakers in St Petersburg on Wednesday. “If someone intends to intervene in the ongoing events from the outside, and create strategic threats for Russia that are unacceptable to us, they should know that our retaliatory strikes will be lightning-fast,” he said. “We have all the tools for this, things no one else can boast of having now. And we will not boast, we will use them if necessary. And I want everyone to know that.” It is not the first time that Kremlin leaders or propagandists have warned of a nuclear conflagration, although the threats have become ever clearer and less veiled as the war drags on. When he ordered the invasion on Feb. 24, Putin warned that those who tried to stop Russia achieving its aims would face “consequences that you’ve never faced in your history”—which was taken to mean nuclear weapons. At that point, the invasion still appeared to be an almost comfortable imperialist adventure for Putin and his generals, who were super-confident that Ukrainian resistance would soon be snuffed out and the government of Volodymyr Zelensky ousted. But, out-thought and outfought by better-prepared Ukrainian forces, the Russians suffered a humiliating setback in the battle for Kyiv. Forced to retreat, the Russian military is now focusing its might on areas of eastern and southern Ukraine, where it is making costly but grinding progress as it tries to encircle Ukrainian forces in the east and take full control of the Black Sea coast up to Odesa. The Ukrainian defence ministry said on Thursday that the Russians, who are now fighting under a single commander, were stepping up their offensives in both eastern Ukraine and in the south and “exerting intense fire” on all fronts. In the early battle for Kyiv, Russia suffered painful losses at the hands of Ukrainian light infantry and special forces, who used their knowledge of the terrain to take out Russian columns—leaving behind the oxidised remains of Russian tanks and fighting vehicles, identifiable only by the letter “Z”. Military experts say the latest phase of the war—just as crucial for Ukraine's survival as a nation—is more conventional in terms of warfare, fought on flatter and more open terrain with the power of each side's artillery key to success. A number of Western nations are sending hundreds of artillery pieces, plus tens of thousands of shells, to Ukraine. The Pentagon on Wednesday published pictures of dozens of 155-mm howitzers being loaded onto an aircraft at the March Air Reserve Base in California. The ever-increasing flow of weaponry into Ukraine presents a huge issue for the Russians, whose own munition factories are largely sitting idle for a lack of foreign-made components because of international sanctions. Hence the growing chorus of nuclear threats from the Kremlin and its mouthpieces. Read more at The Daily Beast. Get the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

4/29/2022,"(Reuters) - Russia's defence ministry said on Wednesday its Kalibr missiles had struck an arms depot in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region housing weapons from the United States and European countries. The ministry -- which said its air force had destroyed 59 Ukrainian military targets overnight -- said the missiles had ""destroyed hangars with a large batch of foreign weapons and ammunition supplied to Ukrainian troops by the United States and European countries."" It was not possible to independently confirm the Russian claim, which did not say which kinds of weapons were housed in the hangars. Russia has warned the United States that large Western deliveries of weapons to Ukraine are fuelling the nine-week-old conflict. The United States and NATO have ruled out sending their own forces to Ukraine, but Washington and its European allies have supplied large quantities of weapons to Kyiv, including drones and anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles.

4/29/2022,"When Deanna Kohley with a donkey rescue organization bought a donkey named Jayla, she later learned the animal was pregnant. But she had no idea Jayla was carrying a very rare baby. Before Jayla gave birth, Kohley with T&D Donkey Rescue Inc. brought her to the Veterinary Health Center at Kansas State University “to ensure the best chance of survival for her foal,” according to an April 26 Facebook post. And out popped a foal with a donkey face and zebra legs, photos from the K-State vet center show. That was when “it became apparent” that Jayla had mated with a zebra before she was purchased by the Missouri nonprofit. This makes the new baby — named Zyla — a zonkey. She’s a rare hybrid that’s part donkey and part zebra, according to the school. “Both Zyla and her mother are currently doing well at home,” the health center said. Zyla is not the first zonkey to make a surprise appearance. In April 2020, Sheldrick Wildlife Trust in Kenya announced a zonkey was born to a zebra the group had helped home. “At first, we thought that (the foal) had just been wallowing in the mud bath, but then the truth dawned on us: Our wayward zebra had given birth to a zonkey,” the organization said. T&D Donkey Rescue provides medical attention to donkeys that have been neglected, abandoned or abused, according to its website. “If a donkey can not be rehabilitated, physically or psychologically, they will live at the rescue as long as they are comfortably able,” the non-profit group says. “Working closely with our veterinarians, equine chiropractor, and farriers, we make decisions based on what is best for every donkey and the rescue. Our donkeys live in a natural environment and in herds that are honored and protected.” The volunteer organization works with donkeys from states including Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Kansas.

4/29/2022,"Former CIA director John Brennan said Russian President Vladimir Putin knows his plan for invading Ukraine has “completely collapsed” and warned the Russian leader will resort to threatening the West. On Wednesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Deadline: White House,” Brennan told anchor Nicolle Wallace that Putin is “clearly reacting to ongoing developments” in Ukraine, “many of which have been setbacks to Russia,” he said. Putin has “been adapting on the military battlefield in Ukraine by consolidating and repositioning forces along the east and the south” because of “the pummeling” his forces have received, Brennan said. The Russian leader also is “reacting to the strength of NATO support and particularly the ongoing supply of weapons and ammunition to the Ukrainian forces,” he continued. Brennan envisioned Putin putting more pressure on other neighboring countries, such as Poland and Bulgaria, where he’s cut off natural gas deliveries. Putin “realizes that his initial game plan has just completely collapsed and therefore he has to adapt and react,” said Brennan, who led the CIA from 2013 to 2017. “It’s going to be a combination of saber-rattling and rhetorical flourishes, he’s trying to again threaten the West,” he added. “But also taking these types of steps to try to appeal to those sympathizers in Europe and also the United States, unfortunately, as a way to again split the NATO alliance and to weaken the resolve and the determination of NATO to continue to support Ukraine.” Watch the interview here: ""[Putin] realizes that his initial game plan has just completely collapsed and therefore he has to adapt and react, and so it's going to be a combination of saber rattling and rhetorical flourishes to threaten the West"" - @JohnBrennan w/ @NicolleDWallacepic.twitter.com/hAg6uQOZcB — Deadline White House (@DeadlineWH) April 27, 2022 This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

4/29/2022,"MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines has pulled the plug on all domestic screenings of a Hollywood film called ""Uncharted"", over a scene showing a disputed map of the South China Sea, the foreign ministry said on Wednesday. The move comes shortly after Vietnam, another claimant in the South China Sea, also banned the Sony Pictures action movie, which stars Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg. It was released in the Philippines on Feb. 23. A two-second frame in the movie contains an image of the so-called nine-dash line, which marks China's claims in the South China Sea, a strategic waterway. The scene ""is contrary to national interest,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement. The U-shaped line is a feature used on Chinese maps to illustrate its maritime territory in a region where Taiwan, Vietnam, Brunei, and Malaysia, the Philippines all have competing claims. A 2016 ruling by an arbitration tribunal in The Hague invalidated China's claims to almost the entire waterway through which about $3 trillion worth of ship-borne trade passes annually. Beijing did not participate in the court proceedings and does not recognise the ruling. Sony's Columbia Pictures Industries Inc was ordered to stop screening the film and has complied, the foreign ministry said. Sony Pictures did not immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment. In 2019, the Philippines' foreign ministry requested DreamWorks to shut down cinema screenings of animated film ""Abominable"" after a scene showed the same Chinese nine-dash line.

Local authorities have spoken out, labeling the video ""fake."" Various clips claiming to show a ""real mermaid"" on a beach have gone viral across TikTok and YouTube, causing widespread speculation about how the footage came to be, and leading local authorities to debunk the claims. On April 6, a user called Aamir Cali uploaded a TikTok captioned ""Real Mermaid Caught in Muizenberg South Africa."" The clip shows a group of people crowding around a human-like figure with a long moving tail attached to its lower body. Real Mermaid Caught in Muizenberg South Africa🧜‍♀️🧜😳🤔 It went viral with 9.6 million views and is one of several on the user's account that claim to show a ""real mermaid"" caught on film. The user did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. Video: This mermaid performs all over the world According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, there is no evidence that mermaids — known in mythology as creatures that are half-human and half-fish — have ever lived on the earth. The majority of comments under the video expressed skepticism, with viewers confused by what the footage depicted. Some speculated the tail-like object in the clip is actually a large fish that has partially swallowed the child. Several comments also said the tail-like object may be attached to a ""set of strings"" that could be pulled to make it move. Dan Evon wrote for fact-checking website Snopes that, ""In all likelihood, this video is a digitally altered composite featuring genuine footage of a dying fish and digitally added images of a child or doll."" British television news outlet ITV News also analyzed the video in an April 14 report broadcast exclusively on Instagram and YouTube, concluding that, ""With no solid scientific evidence of mermaids even existing, and this video's authenticity being disputed, it's pretty unlikely that this is actually a mermaid.""   On April 7, additional footage of what appeared to be the same scene resurfaced on several YouTube and TikTok accounts, but this time, captions under the videos said it was filmed in Ukanda, which is a town in Kenya.

4/29/2022,"By Soo-hyang Choi SEOUL (Reuters) - When South Korea announced its decision to lift most COVID-19 restrictions earlier this month, 29-year-old office worker Jang was more concerned than happy. The end of social distancing revived the time-honoured office ritual of after-work meal gatherings, part of a tradition called ""hoeshik"" in Korean. Jang was among the increasing number of young workers here who consider it an obsolete company culture that intrudes on employees' personal time. ""Hoeshik is part of your work life, except it's unpaid,"" said Jang, who lives and works in Seoul. She asked to be identified only by her last name in order to speak candidly about her employer. Beginning last week, South Korea removed a midnight curfew on bars and restaurants, along with a cap of 10 people for private gatherings. The rules had served as guidelines for companies to adopt remote work policy and rein in non-essential gatherings, such as the off-hours drinking sessions. ""The worst part about the after-work dinners is that you don't know when it'll end. With drinks, it could really continue well into the night until who knows when,"" Jang said. Even before the pandemic, an increasing number of South Koreans, particularly younger workers, were already souring on company dinners and similar events, such as company retreats or weekend hiking with co-workers. The pandemic may ensure that the old hoeshik culture is fading for good, an expert said. ""Now that employees know what it's like to have off-hours kept for themselves, companies won't be able to fully restore the old after-dinner and weekend gathering culture,"" Suh Yong-gu, a marketing professor at Sookmyung Women's University in Seoul, said. According to a recent survey by Incruit Corp, a recruiting website operator, nearly 80% of respondents said their companies' meal-gathering culture had changed during the pandemic, with 95% of them expressing satisfaction over the change. The past two years taught Jang what hoeshik-free evenings were like. She spent more time to keep her house clean, make herself a good dinner and work out. Kim Woon-bong, 30, who began working for a city government last year, said he felt lucky not having had to go through the mandatory hoeshik culture, thanks to the distancing rules. ""I actually liked meal gatherings held during lunch hours, because I knew they would end at 1 p.m.,"" he said. ""I am cautiously hoping the company dinner culture will change now that it has been almost gone for two years."" Despite young employees' growing displeasure with after-work dinners, many senior workers still believe such gatherings are necessary to build bonds with colleagues, Professor Suh said. ""It will be yet another conflict between the old and new generation,"" he said. ""But even if the after-dinner and weekend-gathering culture manages to survive, they won't be able to be held as often as they used to be."" While many companies are gradually returning to their offices, some are seeking to find a middle ground, opting for hybrid models instead of implementing a full-fledge return-to-office scheme. SK Telecom Co Ltd, for one, is operating new workspaces to allow its employees to choose whether to work from home, at their head office, or at small dispersed work spaces that the company has opened. ""We don't have specific guidance on company dinners, but they will be less frequent when many of our employees are working from home,"" a company official said, asking not to be named as he was not authorised to talk to media. ""The key is that we don't mind where our employees work or how often they come to the office, as long as it helps improve their efficiency.""
