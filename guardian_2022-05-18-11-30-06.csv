5/18/2022,"Scott Morrison brushed off the need for further measures to curtail Australia’s ongoing high rates of Covid-19 transmission and deaths, and suggested many Australians are dying with, not of, Covid. Morrison told reporters on Wednesday medical advice does not currently support a fourth Covid vaccine for the general population and asserted, without evidence, that Labor under Anthony Albanese may return to lockdowns to combat Covid. Morrison has leaned heavily on Australia’s record combating Covid in his campaign for re-election by citing low deaths in the first two years of the pandemic, when the country’s borders were shut to the world. But after just 2,239 deaths in 2020 and 2021, Australia now has one of the highest Covid transmission rates per capita in the world, with 5,633 deaths so far this year alone and a seven-day average of 45 deaths a day. Despite the worsening figures, Morrison has argued as recently as 20 April that the “pandemic has now passed” because Australians are now “living with Covid”, as the Coalition seeks votes from minor party voters disillusioned with extensive health restrictions. Asked on Wednesday if the death toll was acceptable and what he was doing to curtail it, Morrison said that “every single one of these deaths, from the outset of this pandemic, is a terrible loss”. “As the number of cases has risen, that’s what was always going to happen – as part of the national plan that we put together with the states and territories, the case numbers would rise, and there were some 53,000 [cases] yesterday,” he told reporters in Armstrong Creek. “What you see when you have case numbers of that level is that people, when they pass away from many other causes, they will die with Covid, and their deaths are recorded as Covid deaths – but that doesn’t necessarily mean … that they passed away because of Covid, that’s a very different proposition.” Morrison said the premiers, chief medical officer and health authorities also recognised that distinction. Although true that Covid statistics record deaths of people with Covid, this is because it is a contributing factor in most deaths. The Australian Medical Association in Victoria is recommending a return to mask use in settings where there is a high risk of transmission, such as large sporting events, movie theatres and concert halls, due to the high rates of transmission. The prime minister said he would continue to follow medical advice and put in place the “winter preparedness plan”; he added that “the medical advice has not been to extend fourth doses”. Morrison claimed that because more than 70% of Australia’s adult population have received the first booster, Australia has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world. In fact, with 227 vaccines per 100 people, Australia’s vaccination rate is behind New Zealand (229), China (231), Singapore (239), Korea (244), and some countries with much smaller populations. By the measure of people boosted, much of Europe – including Italy, Germany, France and Greece – is beating Australia.

Morrison then claimed Albanese is “keen to get back into that type of approach” – but offered no evidence for that proposition when challenged. In recent days Albanese has called for an increased advertising push for Australians to get vaccinated, but he has never opposed the national reopening plan released in July 2021 linking the end of health restrictions to vaccination rates. Asked about the fact Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, had not ruled out reinstating mask mandates, Morrison replied: “I believe we need to move on from where we have been, that has always been my view.” Morrison said the government would continue to monitor new variants. “But when it comes to going forward, Australians want to move ahead, and that’s certainly what I want to do.”",News/Australia news,"PM dismisses need for more measures to limit Covid deaths, suggests Australians dying with, not of, the virus",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/18/pm-dismisses-need-for-more-measures-to-limit-covid-deaths-suggests-australians-dying-with-not-of-the-virus
5/18/2022,"Australian wage growth barely budged in the March quarter, with salaries increasing at less than half the headline inflation rate, stoking concerns pay packets continue to shrink in real terms. During the first three months of 2022, the seasonally adjusted wage price index (WPI) rose 0.7% from the December quarter to be 2.4% higher than a year earlier. Economists had tipped a quarterly and yearly rise of 0.7-0.8% and 2.5%, respectively. The WPI increase – the most in a little more than three years - fell well short of consumer price inflation for the March quarter, with the underlying inflation rate of 3.7% the highest since 2009, with the headline CPI gauge that including more volatile price movements at 5.1%. Wages rose in the March quarter at the fastest pace since the end of 2018, at a 2.4% annual pace. Headline inflation though was 5.1% and the underlying rate 3.7%, implying real wages kept shrinking. #auspol #ausvotes pic.twitter.com/OxubFqwN1V The latest data comes just three days before polls close for an election campaign in which wage increases have been one of the more contentious issues. Labor leader Anthony Albanese has said he “absolutely” supported workers’ salaries keeping up with inflation. Prime minister Scott Morrison, though, warned that too-rapid wage rises would stoke inflation and prompt the Reserve Bank to ratchet up its interest faster, hurting borrowers. Jim Chalmers, Labor’s shadow treasurer, said in a tweet the gap with headline consumer prices at 2.7% was the biggest in 20 years. Earlier in May, the RBA said its liaison teams had detected faster rises in salaries as employers scrambled to retain and attract staff as the jobless rate sank to levels not seen since the 1970s. Even so, the central bank expected wage growth excluding bonus to lag inflation by about 3 percentage points and only catch up in 2024. “The annual rate of wage growth has risen for each of the last five quarters from a low point of 1.4 per cent in December quarter 2020,” Michelle Marquardt, head of Prices Statistics at the ABS, said in a statement. Public sector wage increases continued to drag on the overall numbers, advancing 2.2% from a year earlier. Private sector wages increased 0.7% for the quarter and 2.4% for the year.

5/18/2022,"Here is everything you need to know about the voting process in the 2022 Australia election. The 2022 Australian federal election day is Saturday, 21 May. The Australian Electoral Commission, the independent body that runs elections, says there are 17 million people enrolled to vote in the 2022 federal election – 96.3% of the eligible voting population. The deadline for enrolment was Monday 18 April. If you are not sure of the status of your enrolment, you can check here. You can also call the AEC on 13 23 26. You can find your electorate by entering your address on this page on the AEC website. The results of the 2019 election in each electorate are on the commission’s Tally Room site, but bear in mind that boundaries of some seats in Victoria and Western Australia have changed since then. You can read about what those changes mean on the election blog of the ABC’s Antony Green. If you are unable to cast a ballot in person at a polling station on election day, there are several other ways to vote. At this election extra provision has been made to ensure those affected by the recent floods in Queensland and NSW, and people affected by Covid, are not disenfranchised. If you can’t make it on the day, you can vote in advance at a pre-polling station. A list of these will be published on the AEC website. Mobile polling facilities are also set up in some hospitals, nursing homes, prisons and remote areas in advance of polling day, although at this election that service will be limited by Covid considerations (see below). You can apply via the AEC website to have your ballot papers sent to you in the mail. These must be completed by close of polling on election day and returned to the AEC, which allows 13 days after that for the ballots to arrive. In some countries you may be able to access an overseas voting centre – a list will be posted on the AEC website. Otherwise you need to apply for a postal vote, allowing enough time for the papers to be mailed to you. The AEC has expanded the provision of voting by phone (traditionally used for blind or low-vision Australians) to accommodate people who may be required to isolate because they have Covid or they are a close contact of someone who does. However, it has warned the process may not be entirely flawless. People who expect to be in isolation on polling day may apply for a postal vote. Those who test positive or who are close contacts of someone who tests positive between Wednesday and Saturday should contact the AEC to arrange a vote by phone. Close contacts who return a negative rapid test should check with their state or territory whether they are entitled to leave isolation to vote in person. At the ballot box, you will be handed two pieces of paper. The smaller is for the House of Representatives, which is elected using preferential voting. You must number every box in order of your preference for your vote to be valid. The larger is for the Senate, which consists of 76 members, 12 for each state, and two for each territory. On the Senate ballot paper, you can vote in one of two ways. First, you can number at least six boxes above the line, indicating the parties or groups you prefer in the order of your choice. Or you can vote below the line, meaning you are voting individually for the candidates nominated by each party or group. In this case you must number at least 12 boxes to cast a valid vote. There are 151 members of the House of Representatives, so one party needs to win at least 76 seats to form a majority government. Going into the election, the Liberal-National Coalition holds 76 seats, Labor holds 69 and the six others are held by minor parties and independents. To reach 76, Labor would need to retain their current number of seats and gain another seven. However, picking up an extra four seats from Liberal or Nationals would be enough for them to overtake the Coalition. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It may well be tight. According to analysis by Green: “Labor needs a uniform swing of 3.1% to gain four seats and 3.3% to gain seven. Yet Labor is defending 13 seats on a margin of up to 3%.” If the Coalition loses even one seat, but Labor fails to gain seven, Australia would have a hung parliament. In that case one or other of the major parties would have to secure the support of enough minor party or independent MPs to form government. A new wave of independents is running in Coalition-held seats at this election, which may increase the chances of a hung parliament.",News/Australia news,Australian election 2022 voters’ guide: everything you need to know,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/18/australian-election-2022-voters-guide-how-to-vote-when-who-everything-you-need-to-know-australia-federal-poll-day
