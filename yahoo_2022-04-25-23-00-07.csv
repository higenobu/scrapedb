4/25/2022,"A superyacht captain used sonic weapons to fend off pirates, an industry insider told The Times of London. They also deployed ""pain rays,"" which create a burning sensation on the skin, the worker said. The captain used the weapons against armed pirates approaching on inflatable boats, the worker added. The captain of a superyacht deployed sonic weapons and ""pain rays"" to fend off armed pirates in the Arabian Sea, according to an industry insider. ""Kalashnikov-wielding pirates"" were speeding towards the 230-foot yacht on inflatable boats, the anonymous worker, who spent 20 years in the superyacht business, wrote in The Times of London. The captain was said to have deployed an onboard weapon that directed ""ear-splitting, high-volume acoustics"" at the pirates. He was also said to have used ""pain rays"" – narrow beams of electromagnetic energy that trigger a burning sensation on the skin. The worker wrote in The Times: ""The threat of pirate attacks is all too real. In some areas, such as along the coast of Africa in the Gulf of Aden, it's even expected. Any protective technology worth having will find its way aboard a yacht."" Superyachts tend to be adorned with luxury features that make them attractive targets for pirates. A Russian businessman's yacht that was seized in the UK in March has a fresh-water swimming pool and a wine cellar, the UK government said. Meanwhile, a $120 million vessel detained in France features a swimming pool that converts into a helicopter pad and a sun deck with a jacuzzi, according to its maker Oceanco. The amenities on billionaire Roman Abramovich's $700 million superyacht Eclipse include a helipad, two swimming pools, and a dance floor, per SuperYacht Fan. Media reports have suggested the 553-foot vessel has a missile defense system but the anonymous worker wrote in the Times that this wasn't true. Abramovich, a Russian oligarch, is among the wealthy individuals who have been targeted by Western sanctions over their connections to Russian President Vladimir Putin amid the Ukraine war. The sanctions have led to the freezing of oligarchs' assets and the seizure of their luxury yachts and private jets. The anonymous worker also detailed to The Times how a superyacht's crew prepared fresh lobster for its wealthy owner every day despite not knowing if he was on board, and how the crew of a yacht dressed in designer clothes that were thrown away by its owner after he wore them once.

4/25/2022,"A downed power line in Nebraska has been identified as the source of eerie markings in the ground that resemble mythical dragon’s breath. This includes scorched grass, melted soil and mysterious vein-like appendages reaching in all directions. It happened April 22 in Polk County, according to the Polk County Rural Public Power District. The county is about 100 miles west of downtown Omaha. “We always stress to stay away from a down power line as they may still be energized,” the district wrote. “Today we got a call that there was a line down, and when the lineman arrived, this is what they found. This awesome photo shows with the line down how the electricity was moving through the soil thanks to the perfect mixture of soil conditions.” A photo shared on Facebook shows the scorched trail was almost double the length of the service vehicle sent to the scene. Polk County Rural Public Power District, which maintains about 1,100 square miles of line, didn’t say how many volts were being transmitted by the line. But typical overhead distribution lines carry 7,200 volts per wire, while major transmission lines hold 500,000 volts, experts say. “When a live wire touches the ground, electricity ripples out through the ground,” Stearns Electric Association reports. “The minimum safe distance from a downed power line is 35 feet, but we recommend staying at least 50 feet away.” The power district’s photo has gotten hundreds of reactions and comments on social media, including some who noted it offered visual proof of an invisible danger. “Makes me think what could happen,” Lonna Flodman wrote on Facebook. “Looks like a dragon trail,” Norm Baker said. “Both awesome and frightening,” Janice Jablonski posted.
