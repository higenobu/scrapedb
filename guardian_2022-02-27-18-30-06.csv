2/27/2022,"There was a certain irony that “freedom day” – the name given by some to the removal on Thursday of the last official Covid restrictions in England – was also the day that Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine. For two years, as the virus has wreaked havoc and authorities across the globe imposed unprecedented constraints on our lives, there has been much discussion of what the “new normal” might be in the post-pandemic world. Vladimir Putin’s assault on Ukraine is a reminder that the new normal may be shaped by developments more profound than even the pandemic. The “freedom day” rhetoric is both understandable and asinine. It is understandable not just because we all desire a return to some form of normality but also because we should be wary of elements of the unprecedented state encroachments on our liberties of the past two years being folded into the “new normal”. It is asinine because this is no sudden leap from enslavement to freedom, from darkness to light. There are important debates to be had about the responses to the pandemic and their impact. We should not confuse this, however, with a black-and-white debate about achieving “freedom” through the removal of Covid restrictions. This both trivialises the meaning of freedom and ignores the fact that the removal of formal restrictions is part of an unfolding process of learning to “live with Covid”. A study by the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) suggests that the new normal may be much like the old normal. On issues of inequality, welfare, law and order, trust and the role of the state, the authors argue, “the pandemic, has had relatively little impact on the balance of public opinion”. Rather than “having to confront an apparent ‘turning-point’, for the most part the pattern of attitudes and beliefs with which policymakers will have to deal when the pandemic is finally over will be a relatively familiar one”. Yet two years of a degraded social life, of more intrusive policing, of the disruption of everything from work to schooling, cannot but have had an impact. Trust in institutions has taken a particular hit. A survey by King’s College, London and the University of Sheffield shows a large decrease last year in the proportion of people who think the government is honest and truthful, who believe what the government says, who think the government does the right thing in general or who think it acts fairly. More than half the British population disagree that the government is honest and truthful and more than half of Conservative voters are unsure as to whether they can believe the government. These are not, as the NatCen survey points out, new phenomena. The atomisation of society and the erosion of trust in mainstream institutions have developed over many decades. What the pandemic has done is deepen already existing trends, exacerbating some of the worst aspects. Crises and disasters often bring people together. The pandemic, particularly at the beginning, led to a flourishing of community spirit. From mutual aid groups to volunteers helping the vaccination drive, there has been a desire to show solidarity in the face of adversity. But Covid, and the response to it, has also required a greater individuation of society, in which social distancing and self-isolation have become the most vital expressions of social solidarity. Trust rests on our ability to engage with other people and on our experience of a flourishing public sphere. To have a chat at work, argue over a pint in the pub, mingle after worship, debate in a seminar or public meeting or simply gossip with a friend you bump into in the street – all these little moments serve collectively as the foundations of a thriving civil society. Much of this the pandemic and the restrictions took away. It was inevitable that trust would erode too. Distrust has grown not just of politicians or of institutions but also of other people. Throughout the pandemic, there has been a tendency to view other people as the problem. Polls have shown that many people have blamed “the public” more than government policy for Covid failures. The willingness of the government to point the finger at ordinary people for all manner of social ills has only exacerbated this process. All this takes us back to the question of “freedom”. It’s a concept that has many connotations and its meaning is inevitably shaped by context. The possibilities of freedom in a fractured, atomised society, in which people are fearful of others, is necessarily different from that in a society with a flourishing civil society, vibrant social movements and the promise of real social change. ‘Freedom” today has become both trivialised and tribalised. Many on the right who insist that the refusal to wear a mask is a matter of “freedom” are quite happy to support the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill, one of the most ferociously illiberal laws of recent times. At the same time, many on the left are happy to ignore egregious assaults on freedom when it suits them to do so for tribal reasons. Take the debate over the Canadian truckers’ “freedom convoy” protest in Ottawa. For some, the truckers are fascists, for others, an exemplar of working-class resistance to unacceptable authoritarianism. They are, of course, neither. Like many protests and social movements today, such as the gilets jaunes in France, the truckers exhibit an inchoate anger that can take many forms. Whatever one thinks of the truckers’ protest, the authorities’ response – from the police violence in removing them to the freezing of the bank accounts of those who gave money to the protesters – has been authoritarian in the extreme. And yet, liberals and the left have barely spoken out against this crackdown because of their antipathy to the truckers. If it becomes accepted that the authorities can do this to the truckers, what will stop them doing it to a Black Lives Matter protest or a strike next time? The expansion of policing powers in the pandemic will have real consequences for the future and this should matter to the left even more than to the right. Whatever the new normal, less tribalism and posturing will make it easier both to restore a degree of trust and to give shape to the post-pandemic world.

2/27/2022,"Each celebrated album from Binker and Moses, a duo based around Binker Golding’s free-jazz sax and Moses Boyd’s restless drumming, has had a distinctive attitude. Though they’re most at home in a crowd of fellow travellers guesting on each other’s records, Feeding the Machine, their fourth studio outing, sees them joined only by modular synth manipulator Max Luthert, who has played with them live. Boyd in particular is on form, having released his own Mercury-shortlisted album, Dark Matter, in 2020. So while Golding still soliloquises with familiar brio, and scene linchpin Boyd ranges from susurrations to swinging breakbeats, especially on the banging Accelerometer Overdose, Luthert contributes an insistent electronic presence throughout, made up of Golding and Boyd’s output manipulated into drones, whirrs and textures. The highlight of this approach comes on Active-Multiple-Fetish-Overlord, on which Golding’s flutters and parps are chopped and screwed into strobing abstraction, and Luthert’s low-end thrum ensures everything sounds like it is being beamed in from deep space (along with the track titles).

2/27/2022,"Margaret Atwood was recently described in a Guardian interview as “arguably the most famous living literary novelist in the world”, and she is undoubtedly the most venerable. In the Introduction to Burning Questions, her third collection of essays and nonfiction pieces, spanning the years 2004 to 2021, she laments, with her characteristically tongue-in-cheek style, her much-lauded productivity: “Looking back at my sporadic, badly-kept and not very informative journals, I notice that one of the leitmotifs is a constant moaning about taking on too much. ‘This has to stop,’ I find myself saying.” And yet – thankfully – she hasn’t. One of the most notable aspects of this collection is how engaged Atwood, now 82, has remained with the pressing issues of the day, and how vigorously she continues to pursue the public life of a writer; many of these pieces first took the form of speeches. When her long-term partner, Graeme Gibson, died during her 2019 tour for The Testaments, she carried on with her international speaking commitments – a decision of which she writes, “given a choice between hotel rooms and events and people on the one hand, and an empty house and a vacant chair on the other, which would you have chosen, Dear Reader?” In tribute to Gibson, the final section of Burning Questions includes the introductions she wrote to reissues of two of his novels, as well as the foreword to his The Bedside Book of Birds. The majority of the pieces here are concerned with themes that have preoccupied her all her writing life: “subjects that still occupy my shrinking brain: ‘women’s issues’, writing and writers, human rights.” More recent essays add to that list the environment, free speech and the state of western democracy. Atwood has always been a political novelist in the broadest sense (though she would probably reject that description, given her dislike of literary labels), and the enduring popularity and pertinence of her fiction have bestowed on her an iconic status, which means swathes of readers now expect her to make definitive pronouncements on hot-button topics, particularly concerning feminist controversies, and are ready to attack if her stance is not to their liking. One such controversy is addressed in the 2018 piece “Am I a Bad Feminist?”, which is not so much a rebuttal as a careful consideration of the titular accusation. It was occasioned by Atwood’s decision to sign an open letter to the University of British Columbia protesting at its treatment of an academic, Steven Galloway, who had been accused of sexual misconduct. “The public – including me – was left with the impression that this man was a violent serial rapist, and everyone was free to attack him publicly,” she writes. Galloway was later cleared of sexual assault by a judge but lost his job anyway; the signatories of the letter had been concerned with the lack of due process and transparency, but Atwood’s “Good Feminist accusers” called her out for apparently siding with an alleged abuser. “And now, it seems, I am conducting a War on Women, like the misogynistic, rape-enabling Bad Feminist that I am,” she notes drily. But, as any reader of The Handmaid’s Tale knows, Atwood is suspicious of mob justice, especially when it is fuelled by self-righteousness, and she uses the Galloway incident as a starting point to reflect on the nature of witch trials, “in which a person was guilty because accused”. It was a knife-edge position to take in the heat of the #MeToo movement, when believing the accuser was an article of faith for many feminists, but Atwood is clearly undaunted by opprobrium, calling instead for fairness and accountability. “In times of extremes, extremists win,” she writes, “…and moderates in the middle are annihilated.” Given her willingness to throw herself into the fray on social media, it would have been interesting to hear her considered thoughts on other current debates surrounding free speech and feminism. But then, as she observes in “The Writing of The Testaments” from 2020: “I have always been suspicious of the phrase the wrong side of history… History is simply human beings doing stuff.” It’s fascinating to read Atwood’s reflections on her own novels and their continued relevance, sometimes three or four decades after the fact, but equally striking to see how many pieces she has included here generously celebrating other writers. There are tributes to Doris Lessing, Ursula K Le Guin and Simone de Beauvoir, as well as the environmentalists Barry Lopez and Rachel Carson, and an essay on her abiding love for Shakespeare. Through all these pieces she communicates the message central to her wonderful 2014 book On Writers and Writing, that a writer must also be a reader. One of the final pieces collected here is a tribute not to a book but an album, Laurie Anderson’s Big Science, but the exhortation with which Atwood ends it could serve as a tag line for the whole of Burning Questions: “Have a listen. Confront the urgent questions. Feel the chill.”  Burning Questions by Margaret Atwood is published by Chatto (£20). To support the Guardian and Observer order your copy at guardianbookshop.com.

2/27/2022,"The British class system continues to cast its noxious shadow. For more than a century, British working-class children and teenagers have been offered second-best routes to education and training. By contrast, middle-class offspring will find their way – a significant minority via the queue-jumping privileges of private education – to university or a professional qualification. Before you object, I’m conscious of eliding class and educational achievement (working-class pupils have been increasing in numbers at university and why shouldn’t a middle-class child favour an apprenticeship?) But in the real world, the divide between the academic and the practical tends to be shaped by background and to acquire a skill, to be an apprentice, is to come second in the British lottery of life. The standards and quality of what is offered are rarely in the same league as what is offered academically. The extent of what is offered is cruelly financially capped. By contrast, if a sixth form or a university in the academic pathway takes in a student, the funding automatically follows. Get your student loan and there will be a university place for you because the system is designed to respond to demand. However, no such certainty or responsiveness to demand accompanies a young person wanting to train, to learn a craft, and that will remain the case after the current skills bill becomes law. Instead, the numbers in further education are capped by central government around a pre-determined limit. Indeed, and amazingly, spending on further education has halved in real terms over the last 11 years, to astonishingly little complaint, and will recoup only a third of that loss despite the vaunted recent spending increases. So if a teenager wants or needs to train, there simply may not be a course or a place in her or his chosen field. Nearly 22% of our 18-year-olds are neither in education nor in a job that involves training. It is a rank injustice, fatally undermining our economy and the cohesion of our society. But the demand-led academic route is creaking; already the stock of student debt tops £140bn, which will rise to 20% of national output by 2040, projects the Office for Budget Responsibility, but with only a fraction of this debt likely to be repaid. It will become a fiscal millstone around our national neck. If it is to be sustainable, more debt must be repaid. Last week, the government overhauled the system to try to do that, while rejecting an overt student cap and so maintaining the demand-led character of university admissions. Graduates-to-be will still be able to command a place of their choosing, unlike their non-graduate counterparts, but will now repay their loan over 40 years rather than 30 once their salary rises above a threshold lowered to £25,000 from today’s £27,295. To sweeten the pill, the former 3% interest rate premium over the inflation rate has been dropped. In effect, the system will more closely represent a lifelong graduate tax but with university places still offered on demand. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, modelling the changes, says they will make the system much more sustainable. As much as 60% of debt will now be repaid, so releasing, via the quirks of public accounting, a windfall for the Treasury of £5bn next year. But moving to a surrogate graduate tax will hurt low-earning graduates disproportionately. In the old days, they would rarely have repaid the debt; now they will repay much more if not all of it. This, argues Philip Augar, author of the review that prompted the changes, may make applicants think harder about whether certain, if any, university degrees are worth the lifelong graduate tax. A good thing. And although there is no overt student cap, the government is consulting on whether only students with two Es at A-level or level 4 passes in English and maths GCSE should be eligible for a loan – a softer way of arriving at what in practice will be cap. Obviously, the criticism is that the two measures combined hurt disadvantaged students from low-income families and regions more, while a graduate tax, whatever its merits, penalises the young over the old. Both are true, but if a degree has value, at least part of that value should be paid for by the holder rather than the tax-paying public. Equally, data from Ucas suggests that in 2020 only some 20,000 students offered university places did not hold the proposed new GCSE standards. There is a “reasonable logic”, as former Ucas chief executive Mary Curnock Cook argues, that students are unlikely to prosper at university without basic numeracy and literacy and, paradoxically, in future it will force the education system to lift its game so all students reach basic levels in English and maths. This will be no less important for skills training, which also needs basic literacy and numeracy as much as higher education. After all, the point of both is to know stuff and, as Augar argues, surely a degree has to mean something. Far more worrying is the impending squeeze on the incomes of our 140 universities: fees are to be frozen until 2025 as inflation surges, implying a real cut of close to 20% in their incomes, with only partial plans to compensate and then only focused on in-vogue subject areas in the sciences and engineering. Some will get through; others will face severe retrenchment. As for the skills reforms, the centrepiece is a long-awaited and potentially transformatory lifelong learning guarantee to start in 2025. But the question is how generous will be the system of financing its students, so deserving of help. With no mention of reintroducing educational maintenance grants, the omens are obvious. As for apprentices, despite the much-vaunted levy, apprenticeships for those under 25 have steadily fallen; meanwhile, more than half are “in-service training” spent on those aged over 25. We are being fooled. Britain needs to sustain its great university system and put training of the more than half the population for whom academic education does not work on the same footing, both in terms of financial access and in status. The right words leave government ministers’ lips: an emergent framework now exists on paper. Their intentions may have been genuine, but penny pinching, despite that £5bn windfall doubtless earmarked for tax cuts, and neglect for the non-academic will be their downfall.

2/27/2022,"When Giles Duley looks back on the past 11 years, the worst of times, he suggests, wasn’t the moment that he stepped on a landmine in Afghanistan while on assignment photographing a US regiment at war. It wasn’t even the 45 days he spent in the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham, undergoing countless operations, initially learning to communicate by blinking his eye while coming to terms with the fact that he had lost both his legs and one of his arms. It wasn’t the year of rehabilitation when, having been told he would never walk again, he walked again. The worst of times were the months, having been released from hospital, when he was sitting alone in a bedsit in Clapham, south London, waiting for the phone to ring. “I lost everything when I got injured,” Duley, says. “I got no payouts. I just had this horrible a bare room with a bed and a chair and a little oven. I couldn’t get my wheelchair in there, it was so small. I was in a really desperate state. In hospital you live by goals: first survive, next learn to walk, next achieve independence. And then, there you are.” The first words Duley had spoken, having been airlifted from the battlefield, were, “I am still a photographer.” Taking pictures had been his obsession since his godfather had bequeathed him an Olympus camera and a book of Don McCullin’s war photographs, aged 18. He’d worked for fashion and music magazines before he’d gone to conflict zones as a determinedly “antiwar photographer”. At his bedside in hospital, old friends and editors would tell him, “Don’t worry, Giles, we’ll get you working again.” But in his bedsit it was clear those promises had been quickly forgotten. “That was a very, very dark place,” he recalls. “Because, I was like, ‘I don’t know how I get out of this.’ Before, I might have always got a job in a bar or something, but now?” Duley, always a vivid, generous storyteller, eventually persuaded Channel 4 to send him back to Kabul for a documentary and then funded his own trips to Lebanon to photograph Syrian refugees, pictures the Observer published. And he carried on from there, resuming his former career, mostly travelling under his own steam or for charities including the United Nations high commissioner for refugees. Even today, with a decade of work behind him, he says, there’s still always a strange relationship with people he worked for in the past. In particular, he is dismayed, angered, by the fact that since his injury the only offers of work he still gets are around people with disability. “It would be, ‘We’re doing a story on injured soldiers. We’d love you to take the portraits and talk about your own injuries,’” he says. At first, he did those jobs, but after a while he started to turn them down. “I just didn’t want to be that guy. I remember sitting with a producer who had worked with me on a couple of things, telling him about the stuff I really wanted to do. And he literally said to me, ‘Giles, if you want to work, you’re going to have to keep doing stories about disability.’ It was a very uncomfortable conversation. And I had several like that.” While Duley was doing everything he could to prove that he was not limited by his injuries, travelling on his own to some of the world’s least forgiving places, coming back with remarkable pictures and stories, it was as if people didn’t want to believe it. That kind of reaction had started straight away for him in hospital. “I used to do a lot of athletics when I was younger,” he says. “County-level sprinting and so on, and I love the Olympics. I was in hospital just before London 2012 and I remember a nurse said to me, ‘Giles, I bet you’re looking forward to the Paralympics.’ It was as if: that’s your people now.” Duley’s wonderfully combative personal war against that kind of stereotyping has been fought on multiple fronts. One of them is in the kitchen. For a few years now he has posted pictures of the glorious food he has made on his One Armed Chef Instagram account. At first, he says, “it started as a kind of ‘fuck you’ to restaurants. I would go out, I’d be on a date and my food would arrive, and it had been cut up by the chef as if I was six years old.” To begin with, he wouldn’t say anything. But it happened so often he started making comments about it: “I didn’t ask for my food to be cut up.” Sometimes waiters got quite angry. One of Duley’s favourite dishes to make is a delicate egg yolk ravioli, a handmade pasta. He got into the habit of showing the waiters pictures of this to prove his point, and then when they didn’t believe him, he showed the pictures to the chefs. One time, to finally prove the point, in a restaurant in Milan, he stormed into the kitchen and just cooked the ravioli in front of them. Duley, now 50, is explaining all this to me in his flat on the ground floor of a Georgian house on the seafront in St Leonards on the East Sussex coast. One wall is books and photographs and tribal masks and old military tin hats. On the back of his front door is a sign: “Beware: mines.” He’s cooking me lunch in his galley kitchen, a starter of burrata, with roasted radishes and figs, and then a truly fabulous bowl of homemade pasta, Tuscan strozzapreti with chicken stock, morels and tarragon. He laughs as he’s serving it up, explaining how even when he cooks for people in front of them, they still assume there’s a trick. He had an exhibition of his pictures in Paris recently and for the opening-night party he made and cooked pasta for 30 people in an improvised kitchen in the gallery. Because he was cooking for so many he used a little motorised pasta machine to speed things up. And someone said, “Ah Giles, that’s how you do it!” as if he’d been caught out cheating. Food has always played a significant part in his life. His dad is Italian, so that was taken as read. His mum was born in east London to Scottish parents. In the 1930s, at 16, she was sent away to work in a stately home. On the first day she was put in the kitchens and told to skin a rabbit. She brought all those below stairs skills to the family: no takeaways, everything made from scratch. In Duley’s 20s and early 30s, food returned as a sort of after-hours salvation. “I’d been doing magazine photography,” he recalls, “and for five years, I ended up very depressed. I was drinking, doing lots of cocaine just to knock myself out. I was either working or I would just be in this stupor. But while I was in that state, I would invariably watch food programmes, MasterChef. I was on the road with Oasis or whoever, and then I’ll be going home, doing lines of cocaine through the night and bingeing on Rick Stein. I was obsessed by food shows.” That kind of therapeutic instinct returned to him in full force after he had been taking pictures of the recapture of Mosul from Islamic State control in 2017 and 2018. He was based in a hospital run by the Italian charity Emergency, surrounded by scenes of unfathomable horror. “I remembered one man coming up to me, and he hadn’t spoken for days. He had one son who had lost his eyes,” he says. “He just grabbed me and kept saying, ‘It wasn’t my fault.’ His story was that he had been at home during the bombing, he’d told his family to run and a bomb had fallen. They were all killed. He didn’t get a scratch, and this one surviving son was blinded. And he was just saying, ‘I shouldn’t have told them to run.’ Every day was like that. I remember just thinking: there’s nothing my pictures will do to stop this. I felt so powerless.”When Duley came back to this flat, he just shut the curtains for days, didn’t speak to anyone. He was overwhelmed by the thought that all this was still happening, yet nobody cared. His way out of that darkness was recipe books. “Weirdly, I started just cooking,” he says. “Making things like pastas and breads. I was often up all night doing this stuff. And I realised that it was the only place where I could find some peace.” In some ways, he was challenging the dexterity of his surviving, reconstructed hand, mindless, like rolling a cigarette. And his neighbours loved it because he was taking cakes and stuff round to them at all hours. “I realised that was my therapy,” he says. “And my realisation was this: food is the antithesis of war. Where war is about breaking apart communities and families, food is about bringing them together.” In thrall to this idea, Duley developed an idea for a TV series in which he would visit places ruined by war, but partly on a mission to cook with the families he met. He pitched this idea all over, to the BBC, Channel 4, wherever, but always got knocked back, told that it was too confusing a mix of things – the kind of response that makes you despair of documentary commissioning. Ironically, it was only because of lockdown that he got to make the programmes. When the first shutdown happened, the American cable channel Vice got in contact with Duley to give him the green light, partly because some of the places he planned to visit were among the few countries not closed down. It worked because they were a production team of three, able to move quickly without much planning. Only once did they have to abandon plans, to go to Vietnam. Instead, they drove up to Scotland and did a film contrasting the food poverty in certain areas – kids fainting with hunger in schools – with some of the world’s leading seafood and meat production, just up the road. Before I had come to see Duley I’d watched a couple of previews of the shows, one that sees him in the current war zone in eastern Ukraine, and one in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They are unmissable, warm-hearted films that don’t flinch from the realities of living in the shadow or aftermath of war, while holding on to things that make life bearable, notably food and friendship. As a presenter, Duley has an enormous natural curiosity, and a gift for helping people explain their lives. In some cases this involves checking in with some of the families he has helped though a charity, the Legacy of War Foundation , which he set up in 2017 to try to change the lives of people he photographed. “I think one scene sums up what we were trying to do with the series,” he says. “In Lebanon, we went to see Khawla, who I met when she was 12 years old. She’d come from Syria, where she’d lost her father, seen her school bombed and lost all her friends. Her mother had five kids, and because Khawla had heard her worrying about how she would feed them, she had tried to kill herself by drinking rat poison.” When Duley met Khawla the first time, she had just got out of hospital and he decided not to do a story then because he thought she was too vulnerable. Subsequently, his charity was able to rehouse Khawla’s family and support her through school. When he went back with his film team, it was her 17th birthday and now it seemed fine to tell her story. “There’s a scene where we go to the family’s house,” Duley says, “and the mother is crying because her son has been killed in Syria recently. I’m there listening. And that feels like a traditional documentary: go to house, family tells you terrible story, you leave.” It’s what happens next that Duley loves. “The next scene is we’re on the beach, and I’m trying to cook for them. I’m doing a fish on a fire using this kind of fancy aquaponics seawater method to cook it. And they are all just making fun of me and Khawla is laughing her head off.” Generally, Duley says, in this kind of film, there might be a reluctance to show those scenes, in case they dilute the tragic impact of what has gone before. In fact, he can attest, that’s half the point of tragedy, life good and bad, insists on returning. It’s a similar understanding to that which has informed his arguments with producers over the years who tell him that viewers need to be told every time he appears on screen what happened to him, how he lost his limbs. He’s pleased to have mostly won those arguments with Vice. “I’m like, I’m eating fucking seafood in Scotland. The fact that I was blown up 10 years ago, is probably not relevant.” It’s interesting, watching the programmes, just how quickly Duley’s prosthetics become an irrelevance beside his enthusiasm for the stories he uncovers. “For me,” he says, “it’s really important my own injury is not a focal point.” He hopes people will watch the films as they might watch Michael Palin, say, on his travels and think, “This guy’s living a great life.” Talking to Duley, you can’t help but feel he was born for this kind of mission. As we chat, he drops in stories of the profound stubbornness that characterised his growing up. The time, for example, he insisted on walking, aged 12, from Yeovil to see his friend in Winchester, with a homemade rucksack. He was held back a year at school because he was dyslexic, and bullied as a result. He wanted to leave at 16, telling his parents he would not need qualifications because he would only ever work for himself. When they insisted he stayed on in sixth form he proved that point by studying for his A-levels but never opening the envelope containing his results. That envelope remains sealed to this day. “I don’t know where this need to challenge myself came from,” he says, but he’s always had it. He trained as a boxer, then after school won a scholarship to a US college to try out in American football, an ambition that ended when he busted his knees in a car accident. One drunken night long after that, boasting he could run anywhere after sprinting home for a bottle of booze, he signed up for the toughest footrace on earth, the 156-mile Marathon des Sables through the Sahara, and then did it, on practically no training. “I remember,” he says with a grin, “running the first mile in the desert and thinking, ‘This actually was a really stupid idea.’” He finished it all the same. The stubbornness was also the thing that gave him back his life. In the first instance, it expressed itself in looking hard for surgeons that he thought could do the things he wanted. He found Shehan Hettiaratchy, the lead surgeon at Charing Cross and St Mary’s hospitals, who agreed to do a “skin flap” on the stumps of his legs, connecting living tissue, rather than a conventional skin graft. The operations took 16 hours and Hettiaratchy has become a friend and trustee of Duley’s charity. One thing the surgeon said did not surprise him: “He told me, ‘I’ve never operated on such a stubborn body. It kept doing things it’s not supposed to do.’ Apparently,” Duley says, “even my cells were telling him to fuck off.” The stubbornness also got him through the 45 days in the intensive care unit, the ultimate lockdown, strapped to the bed, unable to move. Strangely, not long before he had gone to Afghanistan, Duley had bought his then girlfriend the book of The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly. Now here he was trying to talk with her using his eyelids like the author Jean-Dominique Bauby. “Except,” he says, “in the film of the book there had been that romantic image of this beautiful speech therapist, who creates this custom alphabet. I had the NHS equivalent, which was a badly photocopied alphabet that I could hardly actually see because nobody had taken my contact lenses out.” When he was first injured, and for a long time afterwards, there was a feeling similar to being thrown in freezing cold water. Everything was terrifying. To return to himself, Duley started to create photographic projects in his head. “One of them was ‘100 portraits’ before I die,” he says. “I would imagine the 100 people I wish I’d taken portraits of and visualise the photoshoots. That actually completely changed the way I now work as a photographer.” The other thought was, “Giles, you can give yourself a break now. You will never need to prove anything to anyone, again. Life is going to be really tough but enjoy it, and appreciate it and savour it.” He was 40. It was something like the ultimate midlife crisis. He keeps in touch with some of the soldiers, other amputees, he was in hospital with. Some, used to the routine of the army, rather than the self-sufficient chaos of journalistic life, have found it tougher to adjust. “I quite often get calls,” Duley says. “The hard part is sometimes not the memory of the trauma itself, but how to cope with everyday stuff. The panic of supermarkets and thinking, ‘What the fuck am I doing for dinner?’” The unaccountable terrors of domesticity. The relationship that Duley was in when he was injured did not last. “It’s a complicated dynamic,” he says, “because for some people there’s a sort of glorification of the injuries and what you go through. Some people romanticise it, or they create their own narrative Hollywood script and that creates its own pressures.” He’s seeing somebody else, but tries to keep it very private and low key to avoid those issues. He still has to be wary of overcommitting – he talks about how before lockdown he was about to board a plane when his appendix nearly burst – and then got the flight a week after that operation; and then, in passing, about having malaria in an Indian field hospital in South Sudan. Still, you believe him when he says that “now is the calmest and happiest I’ve been in my life. I sometimes joke about like bomb therapy. It’s quite extreme, but, you know, I don’t know where I’d be if that hadn’t happened.” His great adversary, apart from the limiting attitudes of others, is obviously chronic pain. He points to its three main sites – the stump of his arm, the “toothache pain” of the hand that was smashed to pieces and the flares of pain, “like an electric fence”, in his leg. It’s wearying and unignorable, he says, “but the fact is, I get tremendous pleasure from life. People say, ‘I’m so sorry for you,’ but they shouldn’t. I’m living the life I dreamed: I do work that I’m passionate about. I travel, I laugh and joke, I eat great food. I have this charity that’s having some small impact in the world. “Of course,” he says, “I miss my legs. I miss my freedom. And sometimes things just suck.” He smiles. “Like I put a big pan in the oven the other day, I was doing a roast, but I couldn’t lift it out one-handed. I thought, ‘fuck it’ and ended up dragging the pan onto the floor and eating it there. It tasted fantastic.” Episode 1 of The One Armed Chef is available now on Vice Munchies YouTube channel and officially launches on 7 March",Arts/Art and design,"The One Armed Chef, Giles Duley: ‘Cooking was the way I found peace’",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/27/photojournalist-giles-duley-the-one-armed-chef-food-war
2/27/2022,"We have developed a small ritual in our house, which consists of the fire being lit at 4pm, so it has been roaring for a good 30 minutes before my bambine get home from school. And then we drink tea, talk about our day and dunk a biscuit or two. It acts as a break to propel me away from my desk and stops me becoming saddle sore and walking like a cowboy (I sit on a perching stool). Recently, I made some hobnobs, throwing in a handful of Guittard milk chocolate chips right at the end. The results were life enhancing and, basically, got me through the long, dark days of February. So, too, did these following bars. First, Cocoa Retreat’s Gianduja, £6.25/45g, which is a darkish milk with rich, roasted hazelnuts in cacao from Peruvian Fortunato beans. Its Coffee Milk, £6.25/45, 60% Ecuadorian cocoa, was also gorgeous and both had what I can only describe as a fulsome mouthfeel, very satisfying, and rather too easy to eat. For something more fragrant and unusual, try Salcombe Dairy’s marriage of Rose and Milk chocolate, £6.50/80g, 48% cocoa. It’s super creamy with a wonderful, delicate hint of rose – if that’s your thing you’ll love this. Finally, Latitude’s Semuliki, £4.95/70g is a serious, grown-up, punchy bar from Uganda with great credentials – 50% of the farmers are women, a beautiful wrapper and a seriously interesting taste.

2/27/2022,"A broad and eclectic coalition of more than 100 businesses and campaigners on health, food and the environment is calling for the government to enshrine tough food targets in law, amid concerns that Boris Johnson is about to ditch anti-obesity measures. Greggs, Aldi, Tesco and other major food businesses have joined groups including the National Trust, RSPB and British Heart Foundation in urging ministers to introduce legally binding targets that would force successive governments to take long-term action to tackle the obesity epidemic, with one in four people in the UK classed as very overweight. Writing in today’s Observer, the coalition says the government must seize “a once-in-a-generation opportunity” to transform England’s food system, when it publishes a white paper next month in response to Henry Dimbleby’s national food strategy. Dimbleby, the co-founder of the Leon restaurant chain, called for wide-ranging reforms to agriculture and a tax on sugar and salt. He also said the government should set targets so that, by 2032, people are eating 30% more fruit and vegetables and 50% more fibre, and to cut consumption of meat by 30% and foods high in fat, salt and sugar by 25%. Ministers promised to respond with a white paper, usually a precursor to new legislation, but Johnson said he was “not attracted” to the idea of levies on salt and sugar. Campaigners say this would not lead to more expensive food, but would allow food manufacturers to reduce salt and sugar without fearing that a competitor will undermine them. The Soft Drinks Industry Levy has led to manufacturers reducing 44 million kg of sugar each year from drinks in the UK. Most of the UK’s major supermarkets, contract caterers including Sodexo, Bidfood and Compass, and food manufacturers such as Young’s Seafood and Greencore, which makes ready-meals and M&S sandwiches, have all backed the call for tough targets. Last year, the government introduced restrictions on in-store promotions and buy-one-get-one-free offers to remove junk food from checkouts. But measures to introduce a 9pm watershed on TV advertising for junk food are reportedly under threat as part of the prime minister’s “Operation Red Meat”, to win over Tory backbenchers. Ministers are believed to be considering removing the measure from the Health and Social Care bill when it returns to the House of Commons next month, which led to Jamie Oliver accusing Johnson of “playing politics” with children’s health. Dr Charmaine Griffiths, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, said it was vital for the government to forge ahead with the ad watershed, as well as bring in a new food bill. “A food bill could make everyday foods healthier for everyone, which in turn could help to address stubbornly high obesity rates and boost the nation’s heart health,” she said. “In particular, we support recommendations for an industry levy to drive down salt and sugar content.” Kath Dalmeny, Sustain’s chief executive, said educating people to make healthier choices was not enough. “We can’t solve the obesity crisis through willpower and exercise alone. That policy approach is tried and tested; it has spent a lot of taxpayer money and it has failed. Businesses say they need a level playing field to prevent being held back by a system that is skewed in favour of junk food. We need the government to be bold, to take action and put laws in place that help tackle the systemic problems in our food system.” The Food Foundation’s executive director, Anna Taylor, said that re-orienting the food system was “an urgent priority. It needs the commitment of successive governments, which can only be achieved through a good food bill which sets out how progress will be tracked and by whom.” Environmental campaigners said there needed to be a “radical rethink” of food and farming. “The drastic declines in wildlife are a red flashing warning light that our current ways of producing food are damaging the very ecosystems that support future food production,” said Katie-Jo Luxton, the RSPB’s executive director for global conservation. “We need a radical rethink of our food and farming system to put ourselves on a new path to enable restoration of our fragile countryside so that it can deliver the government’s net zero and nature positive commitments, as well as improve health and reduce inequalities so that everyone can have access to abundant nature and wildlife-friendly food.” Katie White, executive director of advocacy and campaigns at WWF, said: “Sustainable, affordable and healthy food should be the norm, not the exception. The UK government needs to take urgent, co-ordinated action to fix the broken food system. We need them to deliver an integrated national plan to reduce the environmental and health impact of food produced and consumed in the UK. This would enable farmers to speed up a transition to regenerative farming. At the same time, we need businesses and policymakers to take action to ensure that UK supply chains are truly sustainable.”",News/Business,Food lobby urges PM to back health bill and tackle UK obesity crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/27/food-lobby-urges-pm-to-back-health-bill-and-tackle-uk-obesity-crisis
2/27/2022,"Flood waters continued to rise across Brisbane, south-east Queensland and other parts of the state on Sunday night as a “rain bomb” dumped significant volumes of water into the city and put more than 1,000 homes at risk. In some parts of Brisbane, flooding and damage has already been more severe than the 2011 floods, which killed 33 people and caused widespread damage. Heavy rainfall is expected to continue, unabated, until at least Monday morning. Schools in 14 local government areas will be closed due to the unfolding emergency. Across the state, thousands are waiting anxiously as the water continues to rise. On Sunday afternoon, people were rescued from their homes and others fled as water lapped at their doorsteps. Boats and debris caused havoc in the Brisbane River and major city roads were cut. A houseboat skipper had a lucky escape when his boat crashed into the new Brisbane ferry terminal and sank immediately on Sunday morning. A film-maker making a car advertisement nearby captured the crash. Matthew Porter and his colleagues, fearing the man could have died, raised the alarm. Police tracked him in the fast-moving water for 500 metres before he reached the Howard Smith Wharves ferry terminal where members of the public pulled the 70-year-old to safety. He sustained no significant injuries, Queensland police said. Enoggera Road, a six-lane main road just 3km north of Brisbane’s city centre, was cut by flooding at the bridge over Enoggera Creek. Locals who had lived in the area for decades never remember the bridge flooding. “It didn’t even come close – not within metres, even – in 2011,” one local said on Sunday afternoon. The Brisbane lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, said the flood was a very different experience to 2011, when heavy rainfall lasted for more than a week and much of the damage came later as the rivers swelled. This time the rainfall period has – so far – been shorter but more intense. Stuart Khan, one of Australia’s leading water experts, said on Twitter that Wivenhoe Dam had inflows of about 1,020 gigalitres over six days in 2o11. In half that time this year, Wivehoe has taken in 1,380GL of water. Wivenhoe Dam is now containing more than 2000 gigalitres (GL) of water. Thats 177% of the normal full supply capacity (and 49% of the flood mitigation capacity). The 2011 event saw net inflows of 1020 GL over 6 days, but this fill has been much faster with 1380 GL in only 3 days. pic.twitter.com/naFccHL2jm It was at 177% capacity – up from about 40% before the rain. The low starting point had helped to mitigate the extent of flooding. The dam’s manager, Seqwater, began controlled releases of water on Sunday morning, in accordance with procedures developed after the 2011 flood. Those releases would nonetheless heighten river levels. Much of the unanticipated flooding has happened in Brisbane River tributary catchments. The Enoggera Reservoir, which does not have a gate and releases water when it is over capacity, was at 270% capacity on Sunday night. Along the catchment, flood waters seeped into places where flooding had not occurred before. “This place didn’t flood in 2011,” said Gwen Huth, whose property at Wilston in Brisbane’s inner north was flooded on Sunday morning. “When we moved here we looked and we knew this house wasn’t affected. The backyard is now completely underwater.” The Brisbane lord mayor told reporters on Sunday the flood was a “unique event”. “This is different,” Schrinner said. “[In 2011] the rain stopped while the river continued to rise. We have a rain bomb over south-east Queensland at the moment. “We have creek flooding, river flooding and overland flow happening all at once. As the rain continues, we have at least 24 hours of danger.” The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said on Sunday morning that 1,430 homes in Brisbane were estimated to have been impacted “above the floorboards”. There were 1,040 people across the south-east in evacuation centres, 550 of those in Gympie. A major flood warning was issued for the Gympie area as the Mary River rose to 22.81m on Sunday. The town has recorded 1,000mm of rain since Thursday. The mayor, Glen Hartwig, told Guardian Australia it was too early to tell if the worst danger had passed. “At this point in time we’re us waiting to see what the impact of [Saturday’s’] deluge in Gympie and the Mary River will have,” he said. “Certainly the river is falling very slowly.” Scott Morrison said the impact of the flooding was being seen “everywhere from Bundaberg to the border”. “And all the way out to Toowoomba and particularly in places like Gympie, this is a very serious situation,” the prime minister said. Disaster recovery payments – $1,000 per adult and $400 per child – will be available to people in the Gympie and North Burnett council areas. The federal government is responding to requests from the Queensland government and payments are expected to be expanded as the disaster unfolds. Palaszczuk said the weather system was “unpredictable” but would start moving south by Monday. “It’s literally a rain bomb sitting over the entire south-east Queensland,” she said. Hundreds of schools will be closed. The premier encouraged people to work from home because of “a lot of road closures” and “a lot of water”. “I’m urging you your children will be staying at home tomorrow and we don’t want people out on the roads,” Palaszczuk said. “We need our emergency services to get out and about as quickly and safe as possible. Now, also, if you are living in an area where there are, you’re prone to river rises or creek rises, now is probably the time to start thinking about your safety plan.” Six people have died since the rain began; the latest was a man who became stuck while trying to drive through flood water at Indooroopilly early on Sunday morning. Witnesses told police the man had freed himself from his vehicle and attempted to swim to safety before encountering trouble. Police were still searching for a man in his 70s who fell overboard from his vessel near the mouth of Breakfast Creek on Saturday afternoon. Across the border in northern New South Wales, a man was missing in flood waters on Sunday night, as rain continued to batter the state – with warnings of much more to come.Police will continue searching for the man on Monday after officers in Lismore heard him calling for help on Sunday afternoon. “Police lost sight of the man a short time later,” the force said.There were 11 flood warnings in northern NSW, as the rain that inundated Queensland’s south-east headed south.The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, said earlier on Sunday an evacuation alert was in place for residents along the Clarence River near Maclean. Queensland’s State Emergency Service commissioner, Carlene York, warned that there may be more deaths because of people’s behaviour. “I want people to speak to their friends, parents to speak to their children about this behaviour, please,” she said. “There are people on surfboards, people swimming, people trying to cross on waterways and the list goes on. I ask all of you that you take this seriously but you stay off the roads unless you desperately have to be on them for an emergency matter.” With Australian Associated Press",News/Australia news,Flood waters surge across Brisbane and south-east Queensland as ‘rain bomb’ threatens lives,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/27/flood-waters-surge-across-brisbane-and-south-east-queensland-as-rain-bomb-threatens-lives
2/27/2022,"New anti-corruption measures to help track down Russian assets in London and confiscate “dirty money” are to be fast-tracked by the government. Ministers plan to bolster unexplained wealth orders, which can be used to seize illicit assets. The orders have had limited success to date after legal challenges. The government will also shortly announce its proposed reforms of the Economic Crime Bill, which will include a register of overseas property ownership and reforms to Companies House. Labour has criticised the government after years of delays in implementing the reforms. Boris Johnson said last week that the government would set up a “kleptocracy cell” in the National Crime Agency to target sanctions evasion and Russian assets hidden in the UK. He said it would mean London oligarchs would have “nowhere to hide”. While the government has introduced sanctions since the invasion of Ukraine, it is under pressure to widen the measures against key figures who have amassed huge fortunes under Putin’s regime. Ministers face calls to implement sanctions against all 35 oligarchs and “enablers” of the Putin regime on a list drawn up by the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. The list, read out in parliament last week by a Liberal Democrat MP, Layla Moran, includes oligarchs with strong ties to London including Roman Abramovich and Oleg Deripaska. The government last week named eight individuals it was sanctioning, but only two, Gennady Timchenko, a Russian investor and Putin ally, and Denis Bortnikov, deputy president of the Russian state-owned VTB bank, are on the Navalny list. Bill Browder, a financier and critic of Russia, said those on the Navalny list should now be sanctioned by the UK, adding: “You don’t get to be an oligarch unless you’re basically in cahoots with Putin.” Abramovich has extensive interests in Britain, including his ownership of Chelsea Football Club and a multi-million-pound property empire, which reportedly includes a £150m mansion near Kensington Palace. Abramovich has disputed reports suggesting his alleged closeness to Putin and Russia, or that he has done anything to merit sanctions being imposed against him. Chris Bryant, the Labour MP, last week told MPs he had been passed leaked Home Office documents which flagged concerns over Abramovich because of his links to the Russian state and his “public association with corrupt activity and practices”. Bryant said: “Surely Mr Abramovich should no longer be able to own a football club in this country?” The tycoon has not commented on the allegations but last night said he was handing “stewardship” of the club to the trustees of its charitable foundation. Deripaska, an industrial tycoon, has been sanctioned by the US since 2018, but no action has been taken against him in the UK. He is a major shareholder in the aluminium company EN+, listed on the London Stock Exchange. Deripaska has taken legal action to challenge US sanctions, but has been unsuccessful. He has denied any wrongdoing and said US allegations against him were based on false rumours fuelled by rivals. Another member of the Russian elite on the Navalny list is the former deputy prime minister of Russia, Igor Shuvalov, now head of Vnesheconombank (VEB), the Russian state development corporation. Shuvalov was placed on an EU sanctions list last week, but was not among the eight individuals sanctioned by the UK. He owns two flats in Whitehall Court, an imposing building built in the style of a French chateau overlooking the Thames, bought in August 2014 for £11.4m. On Thursday, the UK government announced sanctions it said were designed to inflict “maximum and lasting pain on Russia” and “devastate” the country’s economy. The measures include asset freezes and travel bans affecting more than 100 companies and oligarchs it said were “at the heart of Putin’s regime”, including VTB, Russia’s second-largest bank; Rostec, Russia’s biggest defence company, and Tactical Missiles Corporation, the country’s leading supplier of air and sea missiles. The international community moved closer yesterday to expelling Russia from the SWIFT payments system used by thousands of banks, a sanction that would cripple the country’s economy by making international money transfers far more difficult. It appeared this weekend Italy and Hungary have shifted their positions and will now support the move, leaving Germany looking isolated on the issue in Europe. Boris Johnson has pledge support for a ban. Meanwhile a Russian cargo ship carrying cars to St Petersburg was blocked from crossing the Channel on Saturday in line with new EU sanctions. The 127-metre vessel had set sail from the French city of Rouen but was intercepted by French naval forces and escorted to the port of Boulogne-sur-Mer between 3am and 4am local time, officials said. The regional maritime prefecture told Reuters that the ship was “strongly suspected of being linked to Russian interests targeted by sanctions” and that seizing it was a “sign of firmness”.",News/World news,Boris Johnson under pressure to widen sanctions on more oligarchs in London,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/boris-johnson-under-pressure-to-widen-sanctions-on-more-oligarchs-in-london
2/27/2022,"Aballet that conveys a powerful message to young people to “be yourself”, while making a dig at social media in a story about superficial beauty, has inspired one of the UK’s most famous dancers to perform on the big screen. Dame Darcey Bussell, a former principal of the Royal Ballet, will dance in a new film based on the classic ballet Coppelia because, she said, it will “resonate” with young people who face intense pressures to change their looks in the pursuit of happiness. She told the Observer: “Dance is a great tool to touch on a difficult subject and make it easier to accept and easier to understand.” In the original story, Dr Coppelius is an eccentric toymaker who dreams of bringing his mechanical dolls to life. In the reimagined story, a young woman must save her sweetheart from having his heart used by the charismatic but sinister cosmetic surgeon Doctor Coppelius to bring life to Coppelia, the perfect robot-woman he has created. The lure of superficial beauty poisons a town until its people realise that it has never been more important to be yourself. Bussell said: “It’s about appreciating you can be yourself, and you should be happy with who you are. The young, especially, believe that to be happy they have to change their appearance.” She is disturbed by the darker side of social media, describing it as “an unkind space”. “For all the good it creates in connecting people, it can also be the opposite. It’s a very hard thing to balance, for the young person especially, because they’ve known nothing else. “Sadly, because we communicate constantly on a screen, we forget body language and how we read people’s emotions. When you’re constantly texting, it stops that social skill that is so important you learn from a young age.” She said she only uses social media for work-related subjects, realising that the brevity of comments means that they are so often misunderstood: “Something comes out wrong and people always get offended. There’s no detail. You don’t see the thought behind it. It sadly gives people a way of expressing themselves unkindly, without any thought.” Adrienne Liron, one of the film’s producers, said that it makes a dig at social media in showing characters looking in the mirror after their treatment at the cosmetic clinic: “In the reflection, what they see is like an Instagram or Snapchat filter, a Kardashian-esque version of themselves. The directors wanted to show how people often want to see themselves. Kids are using these filters to give themselves perfect skin, bigger eyes, bigger lips, a smaller nose, whatever. It’s a terrible negative thing.” Coppelia will be released in the UK on 1 April. It is a modern interpretation of the 1870 comic ballet, an innovative approach that mixes 2D and computer-generated animation with live-action dance. It was created by filmmakers Jeff Tudor, Steven De Beul and Ben Tesseur, and choreographed by Ted Brandsen, artistic director of the Dutch National Ballet, with an original score by Maurizio Malagnini, which has just won two major awards. Its producers describe it as a silent movie, using the language of dance, music and animation to tell the story. The world-renowned ballerina Michaela DePrince heads an international cast that includes dancers Daniel Camargo, Sasha Mukhamedov, Vito Mazzeo and Irek Mukhamedov. Liron said: “We believe that we’re the first dance feature film to mix world-class ballet with 2D and 3D animation. It’s unusual to have a film that has no dialogue. There aren’t many silent feature films any more.” She added that Bussell and Irek Mukhamedov, who appear as a mayor and a baker in the film, used to be partners at the Royal Ballet: “This is the first time they’ve been reunited in 20 years. It is something very special in the dance world. The two of them are absolute legends. Irek is one of the greatest male dancers ever, Darcey is one of the greatest female dancers ever. So it will bring a smile to the face of anyone who remembers them dancing together at the Royal Ballet.”",Arts/Stage,"Social media is an unkind space, Darcey Bussell warns teens",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/27/social-media-unkind-darcey-bussell-royal-ballet-coppelia-film
2/27/2022,"In April 1997, Vechernyaya Moskva, one of the most popular newspapers in Moscow, published an article on a former Russian intelligence agent, Boris Karpichkov. The article was illustrated with a picture of Karpichkov’s KGB identity papers, with the crosshairs of a sniper’s rifle superimposed. It warned that the ex-KGB major was wanted by Interpol, faced interrogation by the Russian authorities and was being hunted by organised crime groups. It was reported that his location was unknown, but the stark conclusion was that in the near future Karpichkov was likely to be “liquidated”. More than two decades later, the veteran Latvian-born agent is alive and living in a two-bedroom flat in London. He is a vociferous critic of the Russian regime. Having fled to Britain in 1998, he remains fearful for his life. While Putin faces international condemnation over the invasion of Ukraine, Karpichkov, 63, says the police and security services have failed to provide the required protection for Russia’s dissidents, critics and defectors. “There is no way that anyone would consider defecting to the UK from Russia,” he said. “The British authorities have proved they are not able to protect anyone who needs and deserves to be protected. “I expect to be killed and I can’t protect myself. My fate can only be described as a dead man walking.” A British court found in September 2020 that Karpichkov was likely to be a “threat to the Russian intelligence services” after working in Russia and Latvia as a double agent. It concluded that he had received death threats that were considered credible, and which experts concluded were likely to be from Russian interests. Karpichkov is particularly angered because the assumed name he has been living under and his address were disclosed by the National Crime Agency (NCA) to the Latvian authorities in unsuccessful extradition proceedings. He believes Russia now knows where he and his wife live. A death threat in Russian, which he says was sent to his London flat last month, is now under police investigation. It warned: “No matter how much you change your residence, you cannot avoid your punishment. Traitors like you have no place on earth. Wait, death is on the way for you.” It has been shown that Russian death squads can reach into the UK. British law enforcement agencies found Russian agents killed the former KGB spy Alexander Litvinenko, who died from poisoning at a London hospital in November 2006. Two men from the Russian military intelligence service, also known as the GRU, were accused by the UK of attempting to murder former KGB agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia by poisoning them with the novichok in Salisbury in March 2018. Other Putin critics have died in the UK in mysterious circumstances. A London coroner ruled in April last year that businessman Nikolai Glushkov was strangled in his London home in March 2018. A dog lead was wrapped around his neck to simulate the appearance of a suicide. In March 2014, a coroner recorded an open verdict on Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky, who died in March 2013. He was found in the bathroom of his Berkshire mansion with a ligature around his neck. Karpichkov was born in Latvia in February 1959, when it was part of the Soviet Union. After training as an engineer, he was recruited to the KGB in July 1984, training at its academy in Minsk, Belarus. He was taught the skills of a Soviet agent, including weapons training and unarmed combat. He worked as a senior operative, targeting the activities of American and Canadian intelligence officers. After Latvia gained independence in August 1991, Karpichkov continued working for Russia. He was tasked by the new domestic security agency, the Federal Security Service (FSB), with infiltrating Latvia’s new security services with informers. Karpichkov also investigated the links between Latvian officials and organised crime. He says documents were transported secretly across the Russian-Latvian border in suitcases to be given to his Russian handlers. He refused to keep working with the FSB in early 1995 and says he was threatened by his superiors and put under surveillance. Then he was arrested by the Latvian authorities in March 1996 on claims that he was involved in the embezzlement of funds from the collapsed bank Olympia. He denied any involvement and fled the country after being placed under house arrest. Initially seeking refuge in Russia, he considered that he was at risk from both the Russian and Latvian intelligence agencies, as well as from organised crime groups. He arrived with his wife and family in the UK on 21 June 1998 and was granted indefinite leave to remain, becoming a British citizen in July 2010. He says he was not debriefed by the British security services because he is from Latvia, which is considered a friendly state. In July 2019, the Latvian authorities issued a European arrest warrant for his extradition over the embezzlement case. The court was told that during the legal exchanges between the UK authorities and Latvia, Karpichkov’s home address and alias were provided to the Latvian authorities. Karpichkov said the Russian state still had significant contacts in Latvia, which he believes it has exploited to obtain his details. In September 2020, district judge Vanessa Baraitser at Westminster magistrates court concluded there was support for his claim that the Olympia bank prosecution was initiated to force him to hand over valuable information. She said in the judgment: “There is evidence to support Mr Karpichkov’s claims that he has dangerous enemies in Russia who would wish for his silence … I am satisfied that he has received recent death threats likely to have emanated from Russia.” The application for extradition was rejected. A police assessment of his security in May 2021 found there was a “possible” risk to his life and the consequences would be “catastrophic” and fatal. He has since moved home, but the death threat he received in January was sent to his new London address. Karpichkov lives in social housing and has been unsuccessful in his attempts to be rehomed with his wife in a new location. He said: “I feel betrayed because there has been a total failure to protect me. I am now left devastated and desperate.” An NCA spokesperson said: “The NCA shares intelligence with trusted law enforcement agencies in line with the processes and legislation that govern information sharing. The NCA is unable to comment on individual cases where there are ongoing legal discussions.”",News/World news,‘I’m a dead man walking’: ex-Russian spy says defectors in UK are at risk,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/im-a-dead-man-walking-ex-russian-spy-says-defectors-in-uk-are-at-risk
2/27/2022,"Almost 10 million households in England and Wales risk missing out on savings of £950 a year that come from owning an electric car, according to a study warning that richer households stand to benefit most. About a third of households have no access to off-street parking or a personal garage, so will miss out on lower costs from charging the cars using cheaper overnight electricity. Switching to those tariffs and away from fossil fuel-run cars could see weekly fuel costs fall from £21 to less than £3 for those who can access them. However, while 76% of the richest households have access to off-street parking, the same is true for only 56% of the poorest fifth of households. The findings emerge in a forthcoming study by the Resolution Foundation thinktank examining Britain’s plans for achieving net zero emissions and the impact on living standards. The switch to electric vehicles has the potential to cut fuel costs, but it reveals the barriers that remain in ensuring everyone can access them. Purchases of battery-powered electric vehicles (BEVs) have already surpassed projections, representing one-in-five new vehicles bought so far this year. This is double even the most ambitious projections produced by the Climate Change Committee, which advises the government on green policies. The running costs are one of their major draws. Even public charging points cost about 25% less than the average cost of filling a petrol car at the pumps. However, the type of home someone has will impact on the costs of charging. “Unless addressed, these stark cost differences risk creating a ‘charging divide’ – with the bulk of savings risk being accrued by richer households, which risks widening inequality,” the report concludes. It finds that for households with off-street parking at home, low-cost overnight charging could see annual running costs fall to £139, or £389 for those who do not use the cheapest off-peak tariffs. However, those with no choice but to use the public network of charging points face annual fuel costs of £712 – five times higher than the cheapest off-peak tariff. The equivalent cost of filling up a petrol car is around £1,100 a year. Some 9.8 million households across England and Wales have no access to a garage or off-street parking. Non-homeowners are less likely to have access to off street parking. Only 51% of private renters, 38% of housing association tenants and 26% of local authority renters have such access, compared to 81% of homeowners. Jonny Marshall, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, called on ministers to prioritise reducing the cost of public charging and encourage the installation of home charging points in rented accommodation. “Britain’s electric car revolution must be more than just buying new cars,” he said. “The government can address this ‘charging divide’ by acting to reduce the disparity in prices across the charging network and stop those without access to at-home charging paying a much higher rate.” It comes after calls from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) last year for the government to intervene in the electric car charger market to prevent “charging deserts”. It said locations outside of London remained underserved. The expansion of electric car use is a key part of government plans to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. A DfT spokesperson said: “We’re providing over £1.3bn to support the roll-out of charge points at homes, businesses and on residential streets, and today a driver is never more than 25 miles from a rapid chargepoint anywhere along England’s major A roads and motorways. Our EV Infrastructure Strategy will soon be published, setting out our vision to create a world-leading charging infrastructure network.”",News/Environment,Plug in your car … but only Britain’s richer motorists can charge up cheaply,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/27/plug-in-your-car-britain-richer-motorists-can-charge-up-cheaply
2/27/2022,"The last time I filled in for Eva Wiseman for a stretch everything was closing down, hazard tape on swings, bars shuttering, Welsh goats plotting their takeover. The picture accompanying this column was taken on 16 March 2020 in an echoing, empty office, the photographer trying to catch me not looking terrified. Afterwards, I trekked across febrile, empty-shelved London, trying to buy bread and tissues. The city felt as strange as it did on 7/7, with that same sense of not knowing what or where was safe. I went back to London yesterday. “Covid is over on this train,” I messaged a friend crossly on the way, glasses fogged, face humid from my FFP2. “It’s the roaring 20s, we’re all Charlestoning in the sodding aisles.” “Do they have a champagne tower in the buffet car?” she replied. “Yes, and cocaine instead of fruit cake.” In Crouch End, “people are crammed into cafés living their best brunching lives,” the same, cautious, friend reported, wonderingly. “There’s a pug called Hummus in the queue.” Later, provincial mind already blown by the sensory overload of the Francis Bacon exhibition and a Korean supermarket, I found myself stopping to stare at the familiar-unfamiliar sight of a crush of loud, laughing bodies squished into a Soho pub. It’s fair enough. The WHO says we’re heading for a Covid “ceasefire”, possibly even “enduring peace” – (what weird sporting metaphor would Jonathan Van-Tam be using if he still appeared on TV?) The government… no, who cares what they say, but actual competent adults have suggested we can have a little bit of hope, as a treat. From my fortunate, healthy perspective, this is both welcome – it’s lovely to feel the world unfurl in parallel with the daffodils – and appalling. Because on some level I must have believed we wouldn’t get through this, or at least, when we did, we would not go back to the kind of business as usual that requires me to have clean clothes, a presentable face and social skills. But if brunch is back, and business as usual looks more likely than living in sewers, foraging for squirrel meat, I will need to engage with the concept of “waistbands” and “conversation” again. I quite enjoyed becoming my truest, worst self: it was a catastrophist’s consolation to scroll myself into a carpal tunnel, abandon cleanser, mummify myself in old jumpers and declare showering optional. But enough is probably enough. With this in mind, I am embarking on baby steps towards self-remediation. I started with what I hoped would be the easy stuff – basic physical maintenance – but results have been mixed. Getting my ears syringed was disgusting (albeit thrillingly so) and now the world is even louder than I feared. My dental hygienist found a chunk of bagel between my molars then guilted me into purchasing a rainbow of those interdental brushes, several large enough to make me feel like Cletus the slack-jawed yokel from The Simpsons. Invisible, but surely an indicator of improved self-care, I have also tried to tackle my errant coil. So far, I have only managed the kind of exchange with the doctor’s receptionist Alan Bennett might put in his diary if he had a cervix (“Are you sure you can’t find it?” “Well, I’ve had a good rummage?”), but it’s a start. Fashion has gone through several “vibe shifts” without me. I have harvested the terms “indie sleaze”, “haute mess” and “clowncore” in baffled horror from recent fashion pages, and seen Sarah Jessica Parker wearing a dress that looks like a croissant (pastrycore?) A brief online window-shop ended with me being pursued around the internet by a giant, completely see-through pair of granny pants and a bra that is just a ribbon harness with no cup fabric (“Perfect for the boudoir and beyond.”) I know pleading ignorance makes me sound like one of those men who simply can’t understand the pornography charges on their TV package, but I swear I only looked at chunky knits. Makeup and skincare are also challenging. “Foundation,” I imagine myself drawling, cigarette dangling from the corner of my mouth, like that crab meme. “I ain’t heard that name round these parts in years, boy.” Allowed to revert to its natural potato-like state for two years, my face now angrily rejects everything, even SPF, and a spritz of scent is only mood-enhancing until a blotchy rash spreads across my face and neck. More and harder re-acclimation challenges lie ahead. I need to master greetings (Can we touch now? Must we?) and crush my risky urge to police public transport phone crimes. Eventually, I hope even to relearn the “Yes, and” of normal conversation as opposed to coming out with baffling non-sequiturs about old episodes of MasterChef. The only way I will manage any of this is to keep putting on what I understand is known as “lipstick” and heading out into the risky, thrilling, beautiful world. Could it all still go wrong? Absolutely. But hopefully now I won’t have bagel in my teeth to face it.

2/27/2022,"The haunting wail of air-raid sirens urging people to shelter underground. The howl of warplanes. The crump of artillery. The death rattle of tanks. Civilians who have never held a weapon arming themselves with a gun to defend their homeland. War has returned to Europe. And it has returned in a form and on a scale that many complacently thought could never again happen on our continent. A large and despotic power is hurling its military might at a smaller, democratic neighbour. At minimum, the Russian invasion of Ukraine aims to eliminate an independent, sovereign nation’s right to self-determination. Vladimir Putin’s onslaught is designed to prevent Ukrainians from choosing any other destiny than subservience to Moscow. At worst, he will satisfy his appetite to swallow up a country that he has mendaciously argued has no right to exist. Many voices lament that this opens a new, dark chapter of history. I’m afraid there’s an even less palatable truth. The world has been on a trajectory towards an event like this for some time. The Russian attack is shocking, but it ought not to be altogether surprising to anyone who has been paying attention over the past decade. The barbaric battering of Ukraine is the savage expression of a global contest for the soul of our planet. It is a struggle between the democracies and an axis of autocracies led by China and Russia who seek to impose their authoritarian systems not only on their own populations, but on people beyond their borders. Putin repeatedly lied in the buildup to an invasion that he denied was going to happen, making dupes of Emmanuel Macron, Olaf Scholz and the other leaders who shuttled to the Kremlin for a jaw-jaw while Russian generals made their final preparations for war-war. Yet we can also say that Putin has been brutally honest about his ambition to redraw Europe’s borders through violence. He has written about his loathing for the west and his desire to reforge a Russian imperium; he has made speeches about it and he has acted on it. The annexation of Crimea in 2014, the 2008 war that tore a chunk out of Georgia, the ferocious intervention in support of the Assad dictatorship in Syria, the cyber-attacks and information warfare: all were warnings of what he was capable of and how little he was bothered by western condemnation. Then there were the assassinations, including the Salisbury nerve agent attack, which was an act of war on British soil. The response to earlier aggressions was some heavy denouncing and some light sanctioning, counter-measures that were much too puny to deter the Russian leader. Putin’s greatest strength has been the weakness of the west. Nato and the EU passed heated motions. The Kremlin coldly planned its next war. The democracies repeatedly gave him reason to believe that they only pretended to care about naked violations of the rule of international law. Russia hosted the Winter Olympics in the same year that he grabbed Crimea and then the Fifa World Cup four years later. All the blood of this conflict is on his hands, but some of the guilt is borne by a variety of actors in the west who have enabled or emboldened Putin. Figures on the populist right fawned over him as a nationalist strongman worthy of admiration – and still do. Donald Trump described the “genius” Putin as “very savvy” for launching this invasion under the ludicrously fictitious disguise of being on a peacekeeping mission. Moscow has also received succour from hard leftists in the west. Even as 190,000 Russian troops massed around Ukraine, Jeremy Corbyn and 11 Labour MPs signed a Stop the War petition blaming Nato and British “sabre-rattling”. The 11 later removed their signatures under pressure from Sir Keir Starmer, who has been unequivocal in his denunciations of Putin’s “jackboot of tyranny”. Labour now has a leader who can be trusted to take the right stand, but that can’t obscure the fact that Mr Corbyn was its candidate for prime minister at two elections. That was one of many signals sent from this country and others that encouraged the Kremlin to think there would be no meaningful push back from the liberal democracies. How likely was Putin going to take ritual warnings of pariah status and threats of sanctions when so many members of the European business and political elite have been willing to put themselves on the Kremlin’s payroll? The former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder is still sitting on Russian company boards, including Rosneft, the state-owned oil corporation. François Fillon, a former prime minister of France, sits on the boards of a Russian petrochemicals business and a state-owned oil group. Only after the tanks were rolling into Ukraine did former leaders of Austria, Finland and Italy quit their seats on the boards of Russian companies. Lenin had a phrase to describe these people. Useful idiots. Instead of legitimising Russian interests, European politicians should have been concentrating on how to contain the threat posed by Russia’s leader. There has been an awful absence of strategic thinking. That is nowhere more obvious than in allowing so much of Europe – and notably Germany – to become so dependent on hydrocarbons supplied by a regime that is so starkly hostile to democratic values. The talk now is of “crippling” sanctions. The toughest measure available is to boycott the oil and gas exports that finance Putin’s war machine. That isn’t happening because of Moscow’s grip around the windpipe of Europe’s energy supplies. This has attracted self-satisfied criticism from Boris Johnson, but that is the British pot trying to establish bragging rights over the German kettle. While they became hooked on Russian gas, too many of Britain’s elite have been addicted to Russian cash. Successive governments have indulged, facilitated and encouraged Russian oligarchs to purchase influence in our political, commercial and cultural life. Our capital acquired the nickname Londongrad because of its global reputation as a laundromat for dirty money. Take the cash first – and don’t ask too many questions afterwards. That has been the Tory party’s attitude to plutocrats bearing gifts. Outlining Britain’s “severe” response to the invasion, Mr Johnson has talked about establishing a “new kleptocracy cell” in the National Crime Agency. Why did he wait until Russian troops were motoring on Kyiv? There will now be a ban on any further exports to Russia of technology that can be used for military purposes. Why did our government wait until after cruise missiles had taken out critical defence facilities in Ukraine? If the latest tranche of measures is to have a greater impact than previous efforts to penalise aggression, the sanctions will have to be sweeping, strictly applied and sustained. Putin is betting they won’t be. He calculates that Russians can endure hardship for longer than soft western governments will tolerate economic pain. We already have a squeeze on living standards and it will be made more acute by higher oil and gas prices accompanied by increased costs for cereals and minerals essential for the production of many goods. There will be a cost to confronting despotism and the leaders of the democracies will have to convince their electorates that the cause is worth the sacrifice. This must be the end of the lazy assumption that security and freedom can be taken for granted in the west. The democracies will have to relearn the arts of deterrence and become much more serious about ensuring they have the means to protect themselves and their allies against despots who respect only hard power. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the disarmament that followed, the UK and its neighbours have mainly spent the “peace dividend” on giving ageing populations better healthcare and pensions than they would otherwise have enjoyed. A reluctance to spend more on defence has continued even as China and Russia have become increasingly belligerent. Only a third of Nato’s 30 members are currently meeting the commitment to spend 2% of GDP on their armed forces. Germany, Italy and Spain fall very short of the target. Liberal democracies urgently need to rediscover the resolve to defend their values against tyranny that they displayed during the cold war. The autocrats in Moscow and Beijing believe that the west is divided, decadent and in decline. They have to be proved wrong. Otherwise, all the rhetoric about freedom is merely noise before defeat.

2/27/2022,"Just a few years ago, student activism and protests were a rarity at Chulalongkorn University – considered Thailand’s most elite and staunchly conservative campus. Yet Thailand’s oldest university, named after King Chulalongkorn, has since become yet another battleground for debate over the role of Thailand’s monarchy and political system. On Saturday, the head of the student union, Netiwit Chotiphatphaisal, said he had been removed from his post by the university, which accused him of activities that damaged its reputation, undermined public order and were incompatible with Thai culture. “They think I’m symbolic of something they have to get rid of, because now the younger generation are very radical,” he said, adding that it was likely that the university administration wanted to remove anyone who might spur on activism among younger students. The student union has provoked the ire of royalists by questioning the university’s politics and traditions. On King Chulalongkorn memorial day last year, it announced it had voted to scrap the Phra Kiao coronet parade, a tradition where two students are carried above the shoulders of others, along with the coronet, an emblem of the university, at an annual football match. Student critics described it as a symbol of authoritarianism. The union has also issued statements opposing the university’s decision to grant an honorary doctorate to a prominent business tycoon, and apologising for the role of its alumni in past political protests against ’s government. But it was perhaps the student union’s choice of speakers at an initiation event that most infuriated conservatives. Young activists who have led mass protests calling for the king’s powers to be curbed, and an exiled dissident who runs a popular Facebook group critical of the monarchy, were invited to address new students through a video link. Parit Chiwarak, 24, a protest leader known by his nickname, Penguin, showed his middle finger and told the audience that the university belonged to students and the people – not to the administration. He faces a raft of legal charges over his role in leading mass protests in 2020 calling for the royal budget to be cut, and for its influence across politics and society to be curbed. The protests shocked the political establishment, and broke a long-held taboo around criticism of the royals. Since July 2020, more than 1,700 people have been charged under various laws for expressing their political views and taking part in protests. Parit, who faces hundreds of years in prison over his activism, was released last week after spending more than 200 days in pre-trial detention. The court requested bail of 2m baht for his release; within hours, an online campaign raised more than 10m baht. Anon Nampa, a human rights lawyer and prominent activist, remains in detention. Alongside a legal clampdown, other forms of pressure have been exerted by those who oppose the calls for reform – from attempts by one university to censor student artwork deemed too political to threats by some companies that graduates who do not attend their graduation ceremony will be blacklisted for employment. The ceremonies, which are presided over by members of the royal family, have been boycotted by some protesters. Tyrell Haberkorn, professor of Southeast Asian Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the targeting of Chotiphatphaisal was part of a much broader pattern of attacks within universities that started after the 2014 coup. “A dean or a department chair will call a student into their office or call a faculty member into their office to say we know you’ve done X, Y, X,” she said. Elite universities such as Chulalongkorn feel especially threatened by dissent within its student population, said Haberkorn. “Even though students everywhere are rising up, I think somehow they thought it wouldn’t happen where they were.” Young people’s attitudes towards politics have changed dramatically over the past few years, said Sirin Mungcharoen, known by the nickname Fleur, who recently graduated from Chulalongkorn University. A court ruling that dissolved the popular opposition party Future Forward, provoking the anger of its young support base, was one of several events that galvanised students. The party had been accused of receiving an illegal loan, a claim it denied. “[In the past] it wasn’t trendy or cool to be into politics,” she said. “Netiwit and other activists like me were seen as strange or different for caring about politics.” In his earlier years as a student, Chotiphatphaisal refused to participate in a ceremony where first year students prostrate themselves before a statue of King Chulalongkorn. At that time, he said, many students opposed his actions. Mass protests led by young people have halted, as the authorities have imposed heavy legal penalties on organisers. Yet activists say that change is inevitable. “Some of my professors say, and I agree, [the establishment] won the battle, but not the war,” said Netiwit. There are other students who will grow to take on the role of activists and protest leaders who have been blocked from positions or detained, said Haberkorn. Younger students in Bangkok’s elite high schools, who will soon progress to higher education, are even more politically engaged than their older peers, Haberkorn added: “The universities have no idea what’s going to hit them.”",News/World news,"The student, the Penguin and the king: elite Thai university roiled by dissent",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/the-student-the-penguin-and-the-king-elite-thai-university-roiled-by-dissent
