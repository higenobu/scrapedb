3/18/2022,"The Australian government’s planned appointment of the foreign affairs minister’s chief of staff to the helm of an influential policy thinktank is yet to be approved, amid speculation the official was not the preferred candidate. The delay in appointing Marise Payne’s top adviser, Justin Bassi, to lead the government-funded Australian Strategic Policy Institute has prompted Labor to warn against “a political captain’s call” on the eve of the election. The Australian reported in December that Bassi, a foreign policy hawk who also previously advised Malcolm Turnbull, was “set to be named” as head of ASPI. It reported the defence minister, Peter Dutton, had recommended the appointment to Scott Morrison’s cabinet. However, Guardian Australia understands Bassi was not the preferred candidate of all of the members of the ASPI council, and that there have been ongoing discussions between the chair, former army chief Kenneth Gillespie and Dutton’s office on the matter. A Defence spokesperson confirmed the appointment process was not yet finalised. “A process is underway to appoint a new executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute … and a decision will be announced when the process has been completed,” the spokesperson said on Thursday night. Dutton’s office responded with a similar comment. Neither Dutton’s office nor Defence answered direct questions about whether the government would make an appointment that is consistent with advice from ASPI or the department. They also did not explain why it was taking so long to formalise the replacement for the incumbent executive director, Peter Jennings, who is due to finish up next month. Labor’s defence spokesperson, Brendan O’Connor, called on the government to rule out a pre-election political decision. “There is no greater responsibility than the security of our nation, and part of that is restoring the integrity, trust and transparency of our institutions,” O’Connor said. O’Connor submitted freedom of information applications to both the department and to Dutton’s office in late December seeking all documents related to the selection of the new executive director, including correspondence with ASPI. Both decisions are overdue. “Considering the appointment for ASPI’s CEO is imminent and we are on the eve of an election, the defence minister has an obligation to respond to the FOI request and demonstrate that a candidate recommended by an apolitical body has not been overlooked in favour of a political captain’s call,” O’Connor said. Government insiders are acting on the assumption that Bassi will be formally appointed, although he may stay in Payne’s office until the election, due in May. The ASPI council had set up a subcommittee to oversee the selection process in conjunction with a recruitment firm. Several internal contenders had been in the running. In a field of potential candidates to lead the organisation, Bassi had been assessed as suitable for the position, but the preferred candidate is said to be Michael Shoebridge, currently a director of the thinktank’s defence, strategy and national security program. While previous media reports had said the decision would have to go to cabinet, the ASPI constitution is not as definitive, saying the organisation’s directors may appoint a person to the top position “in consultation with the minister” and on terms “as the directors see fit”. The Howard government created ASPI in 2001 to “provide alternative sources of input to government decision-making processes” and to “nourish public debate and understanding”. But it stressed at the time that the organisation should operate independently of government, with ministers believing “the perception as well as the reality of that independence would need to be carefully maintained”. According to the Howard government’s charter letter, ASPI should also “take steps to avoid becoming identified with any narrowly defined lines of thought on specific issues, and attention should be paid to publishing a range of views on contentious topics”. In recent years, ASPI has taken on a prominent role in public debate about how Australia should position itself relative to a more assertive China, and Jennings has been a prominent voice calling for a Chinese company to be stripped of the long-term lease over the Port of Darwin. The organisation has attracted the ire of Beijing, particularly for its research documenting human rights abuses in Xinjiang. The now-infamous list of grievances issued by the Chinese embassy in 2020 included criticism of the Australian government for funding what it called an “anti-China thinktank”. More than half of ASPI’s funding comes from either the Department of Defence or other federal government agencies. Defence has earmarked $20m in total funding for the period 2018 to 2023. Last year the government poured in an extra $5m to allow ASPI to set up another office in Washington DC. A portion of ASPI’s funding also comes from defence contractors. The organisation has always insisted that it is transparent about its funding but it “remains independent in the content of our research and in all editorial judgements”. Bassi, who also previously held a senior role at the Office of National Intelligence, is credited with driving the government’s increasingly firm policies on foreign influence and interference and cybersecurity. Payne’s office was contacted to offer Bassi an opportunity to comment.",News/Australia news,Labor warns against ‘political captain’s call’ as Dutton’s choice to head defence thinktank delayed,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/18/labor-warns-against-political-captains-call-as-duttons-choice-to-head-defence-thinktank-delayed
3/18/2022,"Rising numbers of Covid patients in hospital are leading to more becoming unwell, staff absences, delayed operations and long waits in emergency departments, experts have warned. In recent weeks, Covid infection levels have been rising in the UK and hospitalisations also on the up. The number of people in hospital in Devon with Covid has doubled in the space of a fortnight and is higher than at any other point in the pandemic, according to NHS Devon clinical commissioning group (CCG). “The last time Covid-19 numbers were this high was in January 2021, before most people had the benefit of Covid-19 vaccines,” it said in a statement. While far fewer Covid patients are in intensive care, the rise in patients with Covid is having a significant impact, it added. “Many people have tested positive for Covid-19 while in hospital for other conditions, and this has led to patients who are already vulnerable becoming more unwell and also impacted on the ability to admit other patients,” the CCG states. According to data for England, the number of people in hospital with Covid increased from 8,210 on 3 March to 11,346 on Thursday. Meanwhile, data released by the UK Health Security Agency on Thursday revealed that the overall weekly hospital admission rate in England for Covid in the week ending 13 March was 13.38 per 100,000 compared with 11.67 per 100,000 the previous week. The highest rates were in the south-east and south-west, at 19.31 and 19.30 per 100,000 respectively, with the West Midlands the only region in England to show a decline. The report adds that the highest admission rate was among those aged 85 and older. While rising infection levels in the community mean the number of people in hospital who have an “incidental” Covid infection is likely to be rising, the number of those who are being treated primarily for Covid rose from 3,445 on 3 March to 4,475 on 15 March, according to NHS England. In addition, analysts have suggested hospital-acquired Covid infections are on the up. Ian Currie, the medical director of Torbay and South Devon NHS foundation trust, said: “While it is encouraging that the majority of our patients who have tested positive for Covid-19 are in hospital for other conditions and are asymptomatic or experiencing mild symptoms, the impact that the presence of Covid-19 has in our hospitals is really significant. “Under current infection prevention and control guidelines, one patient testing positive for Covid-19 can result in the closure of the whole ward, meaning that beds are unavailable for emergency admissions and for planned operations. This means people waiting longer for treatment in the community and operations being cancelled or postponed and long waits in emergency departments for people needing a hospital bed.” Dr David Strain, a senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter medical school, told the Guardian the situation is continuing to deteriorate. “What we are seeing here is what we’re expecting the rest of the country to be seeing over the next week to 10 days,” said Strain, adding that the pressure on hospital beds has coincided with the rise of the BA.2 subvariant of Omicron. Strain said a key difficulty is in maintaining the option for people to visit their loved ones in hospital. “For now, our solution is we are giving them all the face masks and asking them to do their lateral flow test before they come to visit,” he said. “But of course, when lateral flow tests cease to be free in 10 days’ time, that’s going to be a big issue.” Last week the Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS trust announced it would be suspending visiting immediately because of a rise in the number of patients with Covid.",News/Society,"Rise in UK Covid admissions leading to illness, absence and delays",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/17/rise-in-uk-covid-admissions-leading-to-infections-absence-and-delays
3/18/2022,"This radical reimagining of Jonathan Swift’s 18th-century tale of a shipwrecked surgeon is less a biting social satire and more a journey into imagination and fantasy as a refuge from the real world. Writer Lulu Raczka revives Lemuel Gulliver as a student whose mother is seriously ill, and who decides to be “someone else” to escape her pain through make-believe. So she imaginatively enacts the voyages that comprise Swift’s four-part book from the confines of her bedroom. Directed by Jaz Woodcock-Stewart, there is a lovely, scrappy form of storytelling here as scenes are quickly created and dismantled before our eyes, often with bewitching use ofvideo and projections. An enormous back screen resembles a white sheet pinned up against a nursery wall. The video design by Jack Phelan is thrilling, and perspectives are changed with the use of cameras, model figures, a doll’s house for the Lilliputians and clever camera angles for the giants in Brobdingnag, plus a host of other tricks on Rosanna Vize’s ingenious set. A water-filled tank becomes a sloshing ocean storm for Gulliver’s first shipwreck and the special effects become more sophisticated yet never lose their charming DIY quality. The technical games occasionally distract from the story’s emotional grip but at other times it all comes together. Both the script and performances are full of delightful humour. The musical composition by Ben and Max Ringham, and sound design by Owen Crouch, combine with the projection and movement so magnificently that the show feels most energised in these moments. But the spoken drama feels like an interruption or anticlimax against this spectacle, and the technical inventions distract from the emotional grip of the story, although the script and performance are full of humour. Its pace flags a little and it ends up feeling drawn out, even at an hour and a half. Too long is spent in Lilliput, too, with the same games played around scale. It becomes more surreal as it leaves Brobdingnag and enters Laputa, whose society appears complicated and opaque, with scenes cutting away quickly so it is not easy to make sense of it all for a younger audience. But this section is darker and pacier, the shadowy, haunted set evocative. There is a brush with the Houyhnhnms (or horses) of Gulliver’s final voyage, though this world is only glimpsed, with no sign of the Yahoos. Leah Brotherhead, Mae Munuo, Sam Swann and Jacoba Williams form a strong ensemble as joint storytellers and characters. Munuo leads as a lovable Gulliver and has a great singing voice to boot, while the others double up as the motley characters she meets. Gulliver’s musings about life and death when she is in fear of drowning are beautiful for their dark melancholic interiority, and adults might be left wishing for more of this before the tone snaps back to lightness. But at its high points, it is magnificent – a voyage well worth taking, which could do with a bit of tightening up, but grows with emotional power and punch at the end.

3/18/2022,"There will be scratching of heads in Belgrade over how on earth back-to-back games against Rangers returned just two goals for Red Star. The answer lies in the influence of VAR, wastefulness and Allan McGregor. For the second time in as many rounds, Rangers played the more efficient football and progressed. Red Star’s second, scored from the penalty spot in stoppage time, was barely relevant. This success takes Rangers into the quarter-final of a European competition for the first time since 2008, when they eventually reached the Uefa Cup final. There were shades of that run – during which Rangers were routinely under the cosh – in Belgrade. Yet by the time Ryan Kent marauded forward to equalise the scores on the night, restoring a three-goal Rangers advantage in the process, the outcome was obvious. McGregor’s imperious form, aged 40 and in his 99th European appearance for Rangers, was key to that sense. And there was still, at that point, more than half an hour to play. The evening had started in perfect fashion for Red Star. In front of a typically vociferous support, Mirko Ivanic chested down a Guelor Kanga cross and slammed the ball home. With just 10 minutes played, the Serbians had genuine aspirations of overturning the 3-0 Ibrox defeat. McGregor had other ideas. The goalkeeper made outstanding saves from Ivanic and Cristiano Piccini before the interval. Milan Pavkov should have doubled the hosts’ advantage but miscued his shot entirely after Leon Balogun and Calvin Bassey had misjudged a simple through ball. Not that Rangers were completely without a threat; Alfredo Morelos dragged an effort narrowly wide in the 23rd minute. Red Star’s opening to the second half was actually even more aggressive. Ohi Omoijuanfo left Bassey stranded and even McGregor in no-man’s land but overhit a pass when Pankov was ready to tap into an empty net. How Rangers capitalised. Glen Kamara played a wonderful flick into the path of the rampaging Kent, who opted to go for goal rather than play in Morelos. The shot flicked off Alexsandar Dragovic on the way beyond Milan Borjan. Ivanic prodded wide. McGregor produced a double save, El Fardou Ben Nabouhane left with head in hands after failing to convert a rebound. Ben Nabouhane did beat McGregor – who saved a penalty in the first leg - from 12 yards after Kamara upended Filippo Falco but his was to be Rangers’ night; again. With Borussia Dortmund and Red Star seen off in successive rounds, dreams of another final appearance would hardly be unreasonable. A full-time, multi-player melee endorsed Red Star’s frustrations.",Sport/Football,Rangers reach Europa League last eight despite Red Star Belgrade defeat,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/17/red-star-belgrade-rangers-europa-league-last-16-second-leg-match-report
3/18/2022,"Good morning. The west is now supplying Ukraine with a range of military weapons, as six countries accuse Russia of war crimes. Residents in Kyiv have been documenting evidence of possible war crimes at great personal risk. And hundreds of Ukrainians fleeing the conflict are expected to arrive in Australia within the coming days. Russia has been accused by Britain, the US, France, Albania, Ireland and Norway of war crimes in Ukraine, as Paris claimed Vladimir Putin was only pretending to be interested in negotiating a peace deal. The six nations challenged Russia before a UN security council meeting as the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said there was now “very, very strong evidence” of war crimes being committed by Russian forces. The US president, Joe Biden, has announced an $800m package of arms to Ukraine as the west steps up military aid against invading Russia forces. The west’s military assistance to Ukraine began cautiously with helmets and flak jackets but now includes drones that can destroy Russian tanks and artillery from 80km away. The west has repeatedly refused to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine but is now supplying a range of powerful weapons. There is “nowhere on Earth” where people are more at risk than the isolated region of northern Ethiopia, according to the head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who has urged the world not to forget the humanitarian crisis in Tigray. The UN has been unable to get emergency food supplies into Tigray since mid-December. And while in recent weeks medical supplies have started to trickle in, after a six-month hiatus, the WHO and doctors on the ground have said the amount arriving is nowhere near enough to meet the needs of the population. Often there is not enough fuel to get supplies to where they need to go. Alluding to the Russian invasion of its neighbour, Ghebreyesus said: “Just as we continue to call on Russia to make peace in Ukraine, so we continue to call on Ethiopia and Eritrea to end the blockade, the siege, and allow safe access for humanitarian supplies and workers to save lives.” Motor homes intended for Lismore residents whose houses were inundated in this month’s eastern Australia floods are lying empty because linen and water sources have not been organised, while housing “pods” promised by the New South Wales government are yet to materialise. The measures were announced as part of a temporary housing package last week but, three weeks on from the flood, thousands of locals are still living in evacuation centres due to the lacklustre speed of official support. More than 3,600 homes across the NSW northern rivers have been deemed uninhabitable due to floods by State Emergency Services assessors, and the premier, Dominic Perrottet, has said recovery could take years. Bundaberg mayor and former Queensland LNP minister Jack Dempsey has described the Morrison government as being “obsessed by coal” and out of step with almost everybody on the climate crisis “except the big polluters”. Former chief of the defence force Chris Barrie says defence personnel are not allowed to speak out on the national strategic threats posed by climate change without prior approval from Peter Dutton’s office. About 220 Aboriginal men, women and children were killed in reprisal for the spearing of a prominent pastoralist in Western Australia in 1886, in possibly the biggest and most enduring massacre in WA and Northern Territory history. New research reveals that these reprisals were more widespread than previously thought. Owners of several hospitality venues in Melbourne have backed the Victorian government’s $246m trial of paid sick leave for casuals, after taking it upon themselves to provide similar benefits to their workers. The Bureau of Meteorology now says the La Niña event in the Pacific will not break down until late autumn, or almost two months later than originally forecast. So, what’s going on with this La Niña and when will the rainy weather finally end? Former Honduras president Juan Orlando Hernández should be extradited to the US to face drug trafficking and weapons charges, a Honduran judge has ruled. Brazilian activists are outraged after Jair Bolsonaro – who has been accused of spearheading a cataclysmic attack on Indigenous rights – was honoured by his own government for his supposedly “altruistic” efforts to protect Indigenous lives. More than 1,000 police officers and staff in the United Kingdom accused of domestic abuse are still serving in law enforcement, new figures show. Eight out of 10 kept their jobs after the allegations were made, with a small fraction being disciplined or dismissed. Tropical Cyclone Gombe affected parts of Madagascar, Mozambique and Malawi last week, bringing damaging winds and torrential rainfall. Gombe made landfall in the Nampula province of northern Mozambique on Friday as a category three tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of about 120mph and more that 100mm of rainfall in places. The wealthy are buying their way out of the climate emergency with elaborate contingency plans. You see it with the PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel buying a very large bolthole in New Zealand, and wealthy Australians buying land in Tasmania to escape the worst ravages of climate change, Brigid Delaney writes. But who wants to live in a country where the poor drown and the rich are saved? In Rhett Davis’s debut novel, Hovering, Davis skilfully weaves the chaos of life online into a story about a dissolving city and a family on the edge – but is it all a bit too neat? Barkandji artist Badger Bates shares the story behind the giant steel serpent he has made for the 2022 Sydney biennale, and how it feeds into his wider fight for water rights. Australia is heading towards a cost of living crisis. As prices rise, wages are staying the same – or even going backwards for some. And with an election approaching, the incomes of those who can least afford it will be hit hardest.

3/18/2022,"Joe Biden has selected a new White House Covid-19 response coordinator to help lead the US’s fight against the virus, the US president announced on Thursday. Dr Ashish Jha has been named as the new response coordinator. Jha, who is the dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health, is a well-known public health expert. In 2014, Jha co-chaired an international investigative commission that looked into the failures of the global response to the Ebola outbreak. “Jha is one of the leading public health experts in America, and a well-known figure to many Americans from his wise and calming presence,” Biden said in a written statement. “As we enter a new moment in the pandemic – executing on my national Covid-19 preparedness plan and managing the ongoing risks from Covid – Dr Jha is the perfect person for the job,” he added. Jha will be replacing Jeff Zients, the current White House Covid-19 response coordinator. Biden praised Zients, calling him “a man of service and an expert manager”. When Biden first appointed Zients 14 months ago, less than 1% of Americans were fully vaccinated, fewer than half of schools across the country were open and the US lacked any at-home Covid tests. Today, nearly 80% of adults are fully vaccinated, over 100 million are boosted, nearly every school is open and hundreds of millions of at-home tests are distributed every month, the president said. “The progress that [Zients] and his team have made is stunning and, even more important, consequential. Lives have been saved. “I will miss his counsel and I’m grateful for his service,” Biden added.",News/World news,Biden names Ashish Jha as new White House Covid-19 response coordinator,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/ashish-jha-covid-response-coordinator
3/18/2022,"Ministers and trade unions have condemned P&O Ferries’ mass sacking of 800 British seafarers to replace them with agency crew as shameful and “completely unacceptable”, amid furious calls for action against the company’s Dubai owners. P&O Ferries’ services could be suspended for up to 10 days, disrupting its cross-Channel and Irish Sea routes, after an extraordinary day in which the operator sacked its entire British seafaring staff without notice. They learned the news of their redundancy via a pre-recorded video message this morning. Politicians on both sides called on the government to act to stop what Labour and trade unions called a “scandalous betrayal”. Staff were told by P&O to discharge passengers and freight before being sent a video message telling them P&O “vessels will be primarily crewed by a third-party crew provider … Your final day of employment is today.” Long-serving crew were removed from ships by security guards in Dover, Kent, and in Larne, near Belfast. Replacement agency workers, typically a cheaper option and believed to have been recruited in the UK and Europe, had already boarded some vessels in Dover on Thursday afternoon. Unions had instructed members to stay onboard as they demanded urgent government intervention, but by the evening the potential for prolonged standoffs ended, when crew in Hull left their ship. Earlier, the Dutch captain of P&O’s Pride of Hull had supported crew who refused to leave. In Dover, one 46-year-old crew member of 30 years’ service, said he was worried about how he would support his family. He said: “There were grown men in tears worrying what to do about their mortgages. We’ve been treated abysmally. This was planned for ages; it’s not off the hoof.” Legal experts raised questions about whether there had been a breach of employment laws, which stipulate that any employer planning to sack more than 100 staff must give ministers 45 days’ notice. The government said it was given no notice of the plans. The prime minister’s spokesperson said: “The way these workers were informed was completely unacceptable. Clearly the way that this was communicated to staff was not right and we have made that clear.” The RMT union’s general secretary, Mick Lynch, said it was seeking urgent legal action over “one of the most shameful acts in the history of British industrial relations”. Speaking in the Commons, Robert Courts echoed Downing Street’s condemnation of the manner in which P&O crew were fired, saying he was “extremely concerned and frankly angry at the treatment”. The maritime minister added: “Reports of workers being given zero notice and being escorted off their ships while being told that cheaper alternatives will take up their roles shows the insensitive way P&O have approached this issue.” But he stopped short of describing the action as illegal or promising any action, saying: “Their finances are a matter for them alone.” Courts said the supply of critical goods and services should not be affected by the temporary suspension of P&O’s ferries on the Dover-Calais crossing, as well as from Hull to Rotterdam, Liverpool to Dublin, and Cairnryan to Larne, which he said could last a week to 10 days. The shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, said P&O Ferries’ dismissals, including the use of “handcuffed-trained security, some wearing balaclavas, marching British crew off their ships” were “the actions of thugs”. She said it was a scandal that a Dubai-owned company, which had taken British taxpayers’ money during the Covid pandemic, should act in such a way, and demanded the government review DP World’s contracts, including to run freeports in the UK. DP World, one of the largest port operators in the world, is owned by Dubai’s sovereign wealth fund, and chaired by Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, who also heads Dubai’s customs authority. The group owns London Gateway port – the centrepiece of the first of the controversial freeports championed by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and established by the government last year. P&O Ferries was given £33m in emergency support by the UK government to ensure freight kept sailing in May 2020, and it also furloughed 1,100 staff with taxpayer help. Conservative MPs joined calls for the government to act. Huw Merriman, the transport select committee chair, said: “The government must do everything it can – including tabling emergency legislation if needed – to ensure that this appalling employment transaction cannot be completed.” The Dover MP, Natalie Elphicke, urged the minister to discuss “what more could be done to hold DP World and P&O Ferries to account for their disgraceful behaviour”. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said she was deeply concerned at the news. A spokesperson for P&O Ferries said it had to take a “very difficult but necessary decision” to “secure the future viability of our business, which employs an additional 2,200 people, and supports billions in trade in and out of the UK”. They said P&O Ferries was not a viable business in its current state. “We have made a £100m loss year-on-year, which has been covered by our parent [company] DP World. This is not sustainable. Our survival is dependent on making swift and significant changes now.” The maritime union Nautilus International said the news was “a betrayal of British workers”. The head of the European seafarers’ union ETF, Livia Spera, said it was “astonishing that this can happen in a major developed country like the UK”. P&O initially told customers on Twitter that services would be “unable to run for the next few hours” and that port teams would arrange travel via an alternative operator. Cross-Channel ferry passengers and truck drivers were expected to be diverted to DFDS or Eurotunnel services. Passengers on Irish Sea crossings have been sent to Stena Line. But a number of passengers were left stranded and unable to rebook immediately on alternative services on Thursday morning. A driver in Calais due to return to the UK told the PA Media news agency he had been waiting for a ferry since 6am, adding: “More than anything I’m frustrated at the fact nobody from P&O was there to help and advise. I’ve never had such shoddy service from anybody.” DP World bought P&O Ferries for a second time in 2019, for £322m, after selling it earlier in the decade. The business is believed to have been making escalating losses, with the rising cost of diesel adding to disruption from Covid and post-Brexit paperwork in cross-Channel traffic. DP World said it had never taken a dividend from P&O Ferries. DP World has also come under fire for a £146m deficit in the Merchant Navy Ratings pension fund, which includes retired P&O crew. Sources said the taxpayer could be liable for the shortfall if it was left unpaid. DP World last year agreed to sponsor the European golf tour – at a cost of £147m.",News/Business,‘Scandalous betrayal’: MPs condemn P&O Ferries for mass sacking of 800 staff,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/17/politicians-condemn-p-and-o-ferries-mass-sacking-staff
