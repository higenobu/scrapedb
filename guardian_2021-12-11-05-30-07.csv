12/11/2021,"Peloton is no stranger to bad advertisements. In 2019, an ill-conceived “sexist and dystopian” holiday ad prompted comparisons to a hostage video and wiped nearly $1.5bn from the value of the company. And this week, in an unexpected collision of two pop culture icons, the company’s flagship product took on a starring role in the Sex and the City reboot, And Just Like That, as the bike that killed Mr Big.  In the shocking series premiere, Carrie Bradshaw’s longtime flame, who has become a devotee of the luxury bike, has a heart attack after finishing his 1,000th ride and dies in his wife’s arms. The death of the beloved character shocked fans, some of whom asked what the company had done to the series’ writer/director, Michael Patrick King, to warrant such a role. But Peloton says its bike didn’t kill Big. In fact, a company representative said, it may have kept the character, who had a history of heart troubles – physical and emotional – alive for longer. “I’m sure SATC fans, like me, are saddened by the news that Mr Big dies of a heart attack. Mr Big lived what many would call an extravagant lifestyle – including cocktails, cigars and big steaks,” Suzanne Steinbaum, a cardiologist and member of Peloton’s health and wellness advisory council, told the Los Angeles Times. “These lifestyle choices and perhaps even his family history, which often is a significant factor, were the likely cause of his death. Riding his Peloton bike may have even helped delay his cardiac event.” The company knew the bike would be featured in the show, BuzzFeed News reported, along with a cameo from the Peloton instructor Jess King, but was not aware of its role in Mr Big’s death. “Due to confidentiality reasons, HBO did not disclose the larger context surrounding the scene to Peloton in advance,”a spokesperson, Denise Kelly, told the outlet. Whatever role the bike played in Big’s untimely demise, the characters don’t seem to be holding it against Peloton. “He was on that bike for over a thousand rides,” Miranda says in the second episode. “He got the OK from his cardiologist. Exercise is good for the heart.” Of course, Big’s death might not have had anything to do with Peloton at all. Chris Noth, who has played Big since 1998, told the Guardian he was hesitant to return to the role again, but was persuaded by a conversation with the show’s writer and director, Michael Patrick King. “It was a long conversation, it continued through the pandemic and he took in a lot of my ideas and we came up with a way for me to work into it.”",Arts/Television & radio,Sex and the City fans shocked over character’s death by Peloton,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/10/sex-and-the-city-fans-shocked-over-characters-death-by-peloton
12/11/2021,"The House select committee investigating the Capitol attack on Friday issued new subpoenas against two Trump White House officials involved in organizing the rally and march that descended into the 6 January insurrection, as they inquire into the extent of Donald Trump’s involvement.  The select committee issued orders compelling documents and testimony to Brian Jack, Trump’s former White House director of political affairs, now working for the House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, and Max Miller, a former deputy manager for the Trump campaign. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the select committee, said in the subpoena letter for Miller that the panel targeted him as he attended a 4 January meeting with Trump in a private White House dining room about who should speak at the rally on the morning of 6 January. Miller also communicated with the then deputy secretary of the interior and the then-acting director of the National Park Service to strong-arm career officials, who had declined to allow the rally from taking place on the Ellipse, to reverse course, Thompson said. Thompson said the panel was pursuing Jack because he contacted a number of Republican members of Congress, including Mo Brooks, on behalf of Trump to ask them to speak at the rally in support of the former president and endorse lies about election fraud. “Rep Mo Brooks accepted President Trump’s invitation,” Thompson said in Jack’s subpoena letter. “Brooks later told a reporter he was wearing body armor during his speech because he was warned on Monday [January 3rd] there might be risks associated with the next few days.” But the new subpoenas suggest the investigation is edging closer to establishing the role played by Trump in the planning process of the rally on the Ellipse in the days before the morning of 6 January, when he addressed supporters who would later storm the Capitol. The select committee was already certain of at least some coordination between the Trump White House and the organizers of the rally, as the Secret Service would have needed to sign off on how Trump would appear at the rally, according to a source familiar with the matter. But the new subpoenas are certain to ramp up the pressure on Trump as the select committee expands their dragnet to include even more of his former aides, but also for McCarthy, who now has one of his own staffers under investigation in an inquiry he cannot control. Among those the select committee believes helped coordinate Trump’s address at the Ellipse rally was Jack and Miller, the source said, as Jack oversaw Trump’s political operations through the White House, and Miller helped manage Trump’s political operations with the campaign. The new subpoenas are certain to ramp up the pressure on Trump as the select committee expands their dragnet to include even more of his former aides, but also for McCarthy, who now has one of his own staffers under investigation in an inquiry he cannot control. The select committee has so far held off issuing subpoenas to Republican members of Congress and their staff, but the subpoena to Jack raises the specter of him having to testify under oath about what he might have learned about McCarthy’s conduct on 5 and 6 January. McCarthy is expected to be of interest to House investigators scrutinizing what Trump was saying and doing as his supporters attacked the Capitol in order to stop Joe Biden’s certification, as he spoke directly to the former president as the riot unfolded. The House minority leader made a frantic phone call to Trump begging him to call off the rioters as they breached the Capitol, but Trump declined, scolding him that they cared more about overturning the 2020 election than Republicans in Congress. McCarthy, in his desperation, also spoke with senior White House adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner to try and stop the attack after his pleas to Trump went unheeded, a former administration source said. The subpoena to Miller, meanwhile, may adversely affect his Trump-endorsed campaign to represent Ohio’s 13th congressional district, which leans Democratic and is expected to be a swing seat in the 2022 midterm elections. The select committee on Friday also issued four additional subpoenas to pro-Trump individuals connected to the rally: Kimberly Fletcher, the president of Moms for Trump, a rally participant, Brian Lewis, Ed Martin, and Bobby Peede. The total of six subpoenas issued by House investigators comes a day after the select committee held a marathon day of depositions with previously subpoenaed Trump officials, and won a major victory in court that paves the way for them to obtain Trump White House records. House investigators on Thursday deposed Trump lawyer John Eastman, who the Guardian reported led a team of operatives at the Willard hotel to stop Biden’s certification, former defense department aide Kash Patel, former US cyber chief Christopher Krebs, and Ali Alexander. The select committee also prevailed in a US federal appellate court decision handed down on Thursday that upheld that the panel should get Trump White House records from the National Archives over the objections of executive privilege advanced by the former president.”",News/US news,Capitol attack committee issues new subpoenas to two ex-Trump aides,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/10/capitol-attack-committee-trump-officials-subpoenas
12/11/2021,"There is an interesting, and no doubt very common phenomenon called parasocial interaction. This is where people feel they have an intimate, reciprocal relationship with a famous person, a belief that by consuming images of that person, by thinking about them, the mirror becomes a two-way glass; that they can see you too. We all get this to some extent, right down to the entry-level version where you glimpse a famous person in the street and, as you walk past, automatically say hello-all-right-how’s-it-going-bro-safe-see-you-later-ha-ha-ha-be-lucky-how’s-Tanya, because obviously you must know them, and then five paces down the road realise it was Howard from Take That.  It probably depends on your age and cultural obsessions how this manifests itself. I get a surge of this feeling, and a weird kind of familial tenderness, when I see players from the golden generation era in English men’s football: back when the world was young, when the Premier League seemed to offer up a voraciously hungry new frontier. For the players this was a kind of unplanned social experiment. Let’s throw money, fame and malevolent attention at these young men. Let’s give them no filters or protective layers or genuine guidance. Let’s see how they react. At its peak – World Cup 2006, the Baden-Baden Supremacy – there was a tendency to see footballers as an acme of fame-driven debauchery. They bought vellum-upholstered super cars and wore solid gold bowler hats and shoes made out of vintage parmesan cheese. They had – one of the biggest crimes of all – wives and girlfriends. The world can seem like a vicious place right now. But it was vicious in other ways then. Another key point of difference: the players were essentially mute. We didn’t hear their voices much, and didn’t know what they thought in the way we do now. Perhaps because of this, footballers of the time seemed giant scale, a selection of Easter Island heads – the good one, the love rat, the goon – and projector screens for our own feelings of love, need, envy, covetousness. It is a scar you can still catch a glimpse of now. Players of that era look like survivors. Still a little frazzled and bruised, but oddly heroic too. They were the first ones. They went through it alone. And looking back, we never knew that much about them at all. This is a long-winded way of getting round to Steven Gerrard, who returns to Anfield with Aston Villa on Saturday, and who might just turn out to be the most interesting graduate of a very distinct group. Firstly, Saturday is not an audition. People keep saying it is. But how could it be? Gerrard has only just become Villa manager, a huge job in itself. Jürgen Klopp was already an elite coach when Liverpool hired him. On Saturday afternoon he will field one of the great modern-day club teams, currently on a sublime run of six wins in 19 days, with 17 goals scored and Klopp snooded-up on the touchline radiating grizzled alpha-power, another surge of light and fury. Audition that with your inherited mid-season Aston Villa. And yet, maybe it really is an audition, in the same way everything is to some degree. Certainly, Gerrard has turned out to be a compelling prospect as a manager. The most interesting part is just how different, how ideologically opposed he is to Gerrard the player. The young Gerrard was a wonderful thing, explosively brilliant even in his defensive work, and in a way that is oddly outmoded now. Looking back he seems in those early years to reduce down to a single galloping pair of legs: all radical energy, stanchion-clanging drives, slaloming, pond-skater dribbles, footballing third eye prised wide open. Gerrard the manager is something else; modern, controlled and defensively disciplined. In their title-winning season his Rangers team conceded 13 goals in 38 games. His first acts at Villa have been about tightening up and adding resistance. Goals against, xG against, shots against: all have been reined in. Villa play fewer long passes and press much harder in deep areas. It is all quite un-Gerrard. Or is it? If the comic book film franchise era tells us anything it is that origin stories are your power source, the key to your ultimate fate. This is my Gerrard origin story. All good managers are driven by a wound of some kind. Gerrard was mangled through those Golden years, when football struggled to retain some part of itself. Hence the sense of something old-school and agreeably unforgiving. But his main wound is 2013-14 and the lost league title. Gerrard the player was always encouraged to gallop, to overwhelm. He gave an on-field speech in that run-in that seemed disastrously overexcited (one weakness: Liverpool’s main man, their leader, had the desperation of a first-time winner.). Ultimately that 2013-14 Liverpool were cut right through the middle in the decisive game against Chelsea. So Gerrard is building teams to heal that wound. He’s becoming the kind of coach who would have won the league for Gerrard the player. This is football management as therapy, as resolution, as narrative arc. It’s quite good isn’t it? Completely made-up, a maybe story invented out of bits and bobs; but a story all the same. Who knows, it might just take on its own life. Gerrard still has a wariness that translates now into authority. He is clearly obsessed with football, and obsessed with winning. He wouldn’t be a DNA manager at Liverpool. This isn’t badge waffle, of culture blah. He has a style, and will stand or fall on how far he can take that. Perhaps he can even become the first of that generation to make it as a top-level manager. A few have had a go. Wayne Rooney is doing redemptive, powerfully-bearded things in the wreckage of Derby County. Ashley Cole, who really was poorly treated back in the day, seems very shrewd and might have had the England Under-21 job already. Either way the Goldens, those old familial faces, deserve some slack. Gerrard, always one of the most opaque, might just be entering an authentic second footballing life.",Sport/Football,Golden generation survivor Steven Gerrard is writing his own superhero story | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/dec/10/golden-generation-survivor-steven-gerrard-is-writing-his-own-superhero-story
12/11/2021,"“‘We were on the pitch training that day,” says the Afghanistan development team player Fatemah Baratean. “We’d been selected to play in the under-23 Central Asian FA women’s championship, in Tajikistan, then all of a sudden there were explosions and bomb blasts all around, 100 metres from us, smoke, people screaming, mothers running. We didn’t know what was going on.” The coach told the team it would be their last session, that the Taliban had seized control and they should take one final selfie together there in Herat before everything changed.  “We didn’t want to accept that,” Baratean, 20, says. “We were telling the coach it was not true, it was not happening, this was not the reality. But that was our last moment on our pitch.” Baratean began playing football in high school. So did three teammates, the 18-year-old Narges Mayeli, Sahar Chamran (19) and captain Sabreyah Nowrozi, 24, who are also speaking to the Guardian from temporary accommodation in the UK, where they arrived on 18 November. Whereas the bulk of the Afghanistan women’s senior national team made it on to some of the last planes to leave Kabul before the Taliban halted evacuation flights, with visas to Australia secured, the development team were stuck. “We weren’t prepared,” Nowrozi says. “We didn’t estimate that they would suddenly take power. The last 20 years for women and girls in Afghanistan was huge; we had many women actively participating in society – we had doctors, lawyers, judges. A lot of the developments that had happened for women meant we didn’t even think about what would happen if the country collapsed. We didn’t think the country would just give up without a fight.” Despite the Taliban’s attempts to paint themselves as a changed force to the watching world, the players say the impact was instant. “Everything stopped,” says Baratean. “Education, jobs, everything for girls stopped. We were athletes, we were scared for our future. For the first time we saw the Taliban in the streets. It was really frightening.” Baratean says it was not common for girls to play football in schools, that even the female teachers did not approve and “because they were against our participation in football it had a negative impact on our grades”, but they had persevered. “In the first two weeks we started playing outside,” Nowrozi says, looking back to her school days, “and we received threats from the Taliban. There was an announcement from the Taliban that if the people that supported us playing continued to support us, if something happened to us, then they would be responsible. We didn’t give up, we managed to find a secure and hidden place to continue our game. We moved from being outside on a pitch to a school which was more surrounded.” The four went to different schools but were selected first to play in a regional team in Herat, then for the national development squad. “When we moved from the school to the stadium it was timed so that no men were allowed to go in and the doors were locked,” Nowrozi says. “When we would leave the stadium, the men who knew that we were footballers were very insulting – there was a lot of verbal harassment, a lot of insults. We ignored it. We could not fight back because there was a risk they could attack us.” Nowrozi’s father was supportive but pressure to stop came from wider family. Her father was labelled “not a real man” and as “having no honour” because he allowed his daughter to play football. Nowrozi was described as a “bad woman”, as having been “westernised” and worse. “For me it was the same,” says Mayeli. “At first families were against us, they didn’t let us play football, they told us the community wouldn’t accept that you’re a girl and are playing football. People would talk about you, people would argue with you, they would call you names.” Buying sports gear in shops was not an option. They relied on coaches and male relatives to take their money and buy equipment. Why did they navigate these extraordinary circumstances to play? “We didn’t have any other social happiness or freedom,” says Baratean. Nowrozi concurs: “Through football we’ve managed to inspire others, we’ve managed to show women as strong women to the community and to families. We’ve been able to tell them you can still be covered and follow the religion and play football. It’s a positive message.” When the Taliban took over, the players headed for Kabul airport after contacting Khalida Popal, one of the founders of the women’s national team who was helping players to get out. It took 20 hours for the team and their families to reach the capital, with a driver relative of one of the players paid to organise transport. He hid their documents and ID cards and they were split into smaller groups. “We were undercover,” says Nowrozi. “Wearing big burqas, hijabs and masks and loads of clothes to hide our identities. On the way it was so scary to see cars exploding, Taliban checkpoints, many accidents. At every Taliban checkpoint we were stopped and we had to work hard to not be identified.” When they left their homes they felt their chances of getting out were slim and that intensified on arrival outside Kabul airport. “We were being beaten by the Taliban and pushed and forced back, surrounded by gunfire,” says Nowrozi. “But then we had some hope when there was a bus to get us into the airport. We sat in the bus waiting to go, very happy, then there was the explosion [at Abbey Gate which killed more than 180 people] and we had to get off the bus. We lost all hope. “I was so tired, I had no idea what was next. We were surrounded by family members asking us what was happening. I had no answers. I stood there feeling so helpless.” Getting out via the airport became impossible as troops sealed the entrances. The development team and their families were forced to bounce from hostel to hostel in the capital, trying to avoid notice while they waited for help from Popal and organisations and individuals who had offered assistance. Chamran says the hardest part had been convincing their families to leave everything behind and “trust us as their daughters”. Stuck in Kabul, the families were wavering, Nowrozi recalls: “Some were really frightened and frustrated and could not cope with the stress. They started to put a lot of pressure on us to turn back and told us we could live in the home without freedoms and it would be OK. They wanted us to go home and give up on this hopeless fight. We were fighting to keep our families with us.” Eventually they got word that they had temporary visas from Pakistan but they had to make it to the border and cross. It took seven hours to reach via numerous Taliban checkpoints. “The Taliban had leashes and were beating people,” says Baratean of their experience at the border. “They were forcing women to cover their faces; if their scarf was a little bit down they were beating us with leashes. The weather was so hot and it was hard to breathe among the crowd. They separated men and women. They were splitting us, they were beating us, there was a moment when they saw a letter from the football federation and started screaming at us, asking if we were footballers. “We didn’t know what to do, what to answer. We were scared, we said we were and they started screaming: ‘You’re kicked out of our governance, we’ll never accept you, you’re non-Muslims, there’s no space for you in our territories. If you can’t make your way from here you’ll be killed. There’s no way for you to be alive here, we don’t accept you, you have no space in our government.’ We were so scared, we were stuck in the crowd, with a direct threat. We pushed ourselves towards the gate.” Crossing the border was hard. Some family members got through more quickly than the players but eventually there was relief for everyone in Pakistan. “We felt like a bird that had escaped its cage,” says Nowrozi. “But it was only 50% relief because we didn’t know what was next for us, what the future would look like. We didn’t have a final destination.” It wasn’t safe in Pakistan, where the Taliban were also present, and they had only short-term visas, but eventually the UK agreed to host the whole development team with their families, 130 people in total. “The feeling, especially when we landed and we saw the sign saying: ‘Welcome to the UK,’ was a feeling of freedom,” says Nowrozi. “We felt like we were newly born, that we could breathe for the first time. When we got to the accommodation we felt like we were living the first days of our lives.” Feelings are mixed though. “That is our country, our homeland, where we had a lot of dreams and wishes. We left everything behind. But we do have this mission and promise to ourselves that we want to invest in ourselves, to study, to work, to participate actively and inspire women and girls and be an example for others. We lost everything but we want to empower others and send a message to other women in Afghanistan.” The Leeds United owner and chairman, Andrea Radrizzani, helped to get the players and their families out and on 1 December the team were invited to train at the club’s academy. “It was like a child being separated from its mother for several months and finding them again,” says Nowrozi. “We did not want to be separated from the ball. We were running up and down like crazy on the pitch. Just seeing the pitch and having the ball with us, we didn’t want any distractions. After training they brought food, pizza and water and we were saying: ‘We don’t want it.’ We just wanted to play football, we just wanted to stay on the pitch longer. It is difficult to describe it: the best feeling ever.” Now the bigger journey begins, the rebuilding of their lives. Those supporting them have launched a fundraiser to help their resettlement. Importantly, the players do not want the women left behind to be forgotten. “Someone has to make sacrifices to make change happen and that’s what the women of Afghanistan are doing,” says Nowrozi. “We will do our part outside of Afghanistan to continue fighting with them and supporting them. We did it when we were in our country and we will continue to do it after.”",Sport/Football,‘We felt newly born’: Afghan women footballers’ remarkable escape to UK,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/10/female-afghan-footballers-remarkable-escape-to-uk
12/11/2021,"As the United States continues to monitor the spread of the Omicron Covid-19 variant, scientists have been testing the nation’s wastewater to conduct early detection of the virus. In the past week, a team of researchers in California announced they had found traces of the variant in sewage treatment facilities across the state – suggesting that Omicron is already present in multiple cities. The team from the Sewer Coronavirus Alert Network (SCAN), a collaboration between city officials and scientists at universities including Stanford, found that wastewater in Sacramento and Merced contained evidence of the Omicron variant.  “This is certainly suggestive – even though we haven’t had any clinical cases reported in those counties yet – that there is the virus circulating there,” Dr Erica Pan, the California state epidemiologist, said in a presentation earlier this week to the California Medical Association. “We definitely are seeing Omicron across the state,” she added. The first confirmed case of Omicron in California was found last week and authorities across the country are concerned that the new variant could spread widely in the US as it has in countries such as South Africa and the United Kingdom. Multiple countries and US states have turned to wastewater testing as an early gauge of whether the variant is present in communities. Colorado health officials announced on Tuesday that researchers had found traces of the Omicron variant in wastewater that likely indicated more than one case of the variant in the state. The Houston, Texas, health department said that same day that tests had detected the Omicron variant at eight wastewater treatment facilities throughout the city – about a fifth of its total facilities. Idaho’s Department of Health also announced on Thursday that it would be expanding its testing program amid concerns over Omicron, stating that it allowed the state to have earlier indications of new trends in coronavirus transmission. In California, officials said evidence of the Omicron variant was detected in wastewater samples taken as early as 25 November, a day before the World Health Organization named it and designated it a variant of concern. Wastewater testing for Covid-19 emerged last year as a valuable warning system, giving officials a head start before hospitalizations rose, without relying on individuals to take Covid-19 tests. Sewage treatment facilities send vials of sample wastewater to scientists for testing, who can then quickly check for coronavirus in fecal matter. Although wastewater testing cannot confirm individual cases or provide more granular detail on how outbreaks have occurred, experts say the results are quick and there is always a constant source of samples available for testing. In testing specifically for Omicron, Stanford professor Alexandra Boehm told NPR that scientists checked for the variant’s unique mutations that distinguish it from other types of Covid -19 such as the now-dominant Delta variant. After two rounds of tests over the course of the past two weeks, the Sewer Coronavirus Alert Network announced their findings. Much is still unclear about the Omicron variant and how it may shift the course of the pandemic. Early indicators suggest that Omicron can rapidly spread, although researchers in South Africa have reported that it’s possible the variant is more transmissible but causes less severe illness than other forms of the virus. Lab studies on how existing vaccines hold up to Omicron are under way, with Pfizer and BioNTech reporting this week that tests of blood samples showed two doses of its vaccine were less effective against the variant, although receiving a third booster shot provided significant protection. Scientists have said that travel bans from South Africa and southern African countries are ineffective at controlling the spread of disease, especially in light of evidence from wastewater that Omicron had reached the US before the government issued travel restrictions. Health officials and the Biden administration have renewed a push for vaccinations as Omicron begins to spread throughout the country, while the US vaccination rate still lags behind other countries where the vaccine is readily available.

Vishal Garg, who founded the company in 2016, told the employees on the call that they “are part of the unlucky group that is being laid off”.  After the mass layoffs, Garg accused the terminated employees of “stealing” from the company by being unproductive, according to Fortune, which confirmed that Garg was writing about the layoffs under an anonymous account on a professional network. “You guys know that at least 250 of the people terminated were working an average of 2 hours a day while closing in 8 hours+ a day in the payroll system,” he wrote. “They were stealing from you and stealing from our customers who pay the bills that pay our bills.” In an interview with Fortune, Garg said that he and his team reviewed individual employee productivity data, including missed telephone calls, the number of inbound and outbound calls and employees showing up late to meetings with customers. Current employees reported that after Garg fired those workers, he held a companywide call about the layoffs and told the remaining employees that their productivity would be closely watched. “His tone was extremely harsh and threatening,” an staff member told Fortune. In their email to employees, which was obtained by Vice, the company’s board called the events “very regrettable” and said that the company has contracted a third-party firm to do a “leadership and cultural assessment”. In an apology posted to the company’s website, Garg said that he “failed to show the appropriate amount of respect and appreciation for the individuals who were affected.” “I own the decision to do the layoffs,” Garg said. “But in communicating it, I blundered the execution.

12/11/2021,"A woman has pleaded guilty to abusing her pet marmoset, including offering cocaine to the primate and attempting to flush it down the toilet. A court heard how Vicki Holland was aggressive towards the primate, which is native to tropical forests in Central and South America. The monkey’s treatment was shown to the RSPCA after videos were discovered on Holland’s phone by Gwent police after a drug raid at her home.  One clip showed her hand holding cocaine while the monkey cowered in the corner of her home in Newport, south Wales. She is heard saying to the monkey: “Want some coke … lick my fingers.” Another video showed the mother-of-four laughing as she attempted to flush the marmoset down the toilet as it clung to the rim. Holland, 38, could be heard on the video saying, “I need the toilet” and “shall I flush it?” The toilet was then flushed and she called the animal a “fucking twat” and told it “don’t attack me”. The court heard that her phone had 22 “very disturbing” videos involving the marmoset, who was fed “inappropriate food” including kebabs, burgers and sausages. Holland was banned from keeping all animals for life after pleading guilty to three Animal Welfare Act offences and was given a 12-week jail term, suspended for 12 months. She must also pay £420 in costs and a £128 victim surcharge. Prosecutor Aled Watkins said the marmosets have a “very particular set of needs”, however, its cage was “devoid of decor needed for environmental enrichment”. Scott Bowen, defending, said his client was “deeply embarrassed and deeply ashamed of her behaviour”. “In hindsight, Ms Holland fully accepts she shouldn’t have had the animal in the first place,” he told the court. Bowen said the monkey had experienced “distress” but there was “no long-term damage” to the animal, which was handed over to the RSPCA during the investigation. Magistrates in Newport heard Holland informed the RSPCA that she had sold the marmoset a week earlier. It is now living at the Monkey World rescue centre near Wool, Dorset. After the sentencing, RSPCA inspector and exotics officer Sophie Daniels said: “I was immediately and gravely concerned about the welfare of this marmoset when I saw these disturbing videos. Videos from the defendant’s phone showed Holland offering the marmoset cocaine, while another showed the clearly terrified marmoset down a toilet bowl. “Holland was shouting, swearing, laughing and at one point in the clip, the toilet is flushed, showing the petrified animal struggling to cling on to the side of the bowl. An independent vet soon confirmed that the marmoset was suffering unnecessarily as a result of the way she had been treated.” Holland previously appeared in court in May where she was ordered to pay more than £4,000 over a hidden cocaine haul found in Kinder chocolate eggs. Holland and her partner, Russell Cox, 43, both admitted possession with intent to supply a class A drug at Newport crown court. Cox, from Cwmbran, south Wales, was jailed for 30 months and Holland was jailed for 20 months, suspended for two years in November last year. A proceeds of crime hearing was told the couple made almost £40,000 from their cocaine business. Cox made £31,904.46 from drug dealing but was left with just £180 that could be seized in available assets.

12/11/2021,"Six climate crisis activists whose protest halted transport links serving London’s financial district have been acquitted by a jury. The group of Extinction Rebellion protesters targeted the Docklands Light Railway (DLR), which runs commuters around the City, Canary Wharf and other parts of east and south-east London, saying they wanted to draw attention to the financial industry’s contribution to the climate emergency.  Five of them climbed on top of the train with banners that read “Business As Usual=Death” and “Don’t Jail the Canaries”; a reference to fellow protesters who were facing prosecution at the time. The sixth, Dr Diana Warner, glued herself to a train window. They were charged with obstructing trains or carriages on the railway and, during their trial at Inner London crown court, acknowledged their roles in planning and carrying out the protest on 25 April 2019. They argued that their action was a lawful protest against government inaction on the climate crisis. Warner, Ruth Jarman, Ian Bray, Richard Barnard, Nick Cooper and Phil Kingston were found not guilty in a unanimous verdict delivered by the jury on Friday. “The defendants’ motives chimed with the concerns of 12 citizens representative of the wider public,” their lawyer Mike Schwartz, of Hodge Jones & Allen, said. “The jury all agreed the climate crisis requires radical action. This reinforces the importance of both civil disobedience and juries in a healthy democracy.” Ian Bray, one of the defendants, said: “We are grateful for the love, compassion and moral clarity of the jury which enabled them to reach a unanimous verdict within an hour.” His fellow protester, Richard Barnard, added: “Obviously, it’s great to win. But this cannot be the end until we can change the system so that all species, people and the planet are protected before profit. So we call on all people to go out and take action.” Speaking after the acquittal, Ruth Jarman said: “I just want to thank the jury and bless them. I can’t believe they came so quickly to the right decision.” Nick Cooper added: “I’m moved, but not overly surprised that they came to such a quick decision.” The protesters claimed the jury’s verdict was an application of the principles established in June by the supreme court, which ruled that the exercising of protest rights could constitute a “lawful excuse” for obstructing the highway, even if the protest is considered disruptive. They had been asked to consider the appeals of four people convicted at the high court, having earlier been cleared by a district judge in a lower court. In their contributions to the majority judgment, Lord Hamblen and Lord Stephens said: “There should be a certain degree of tolerance to disruption to ordinary life, including disruption of traffic, caused by the exercise of the right to freedom of expression or freedom of peaceful assembly. “Political views, unlike ‘vapid tittle-tattle’, are particularly worthy of protection … The district judge took into account that the appellants were not a group of people who randomly chose to attend this event hoping to cause trouble. We consider that the peaceful intentions of the appellants were appropriate matters to be considered in an evaluation of proportionality.” Giving evidence in their subsequent trial, the DLR protesters stressed that the attention they had paid to minimising the safety risk to the public and to themselves, while still attracting media attention, when they planned their action. And they expressed hope their case could influence future ones. Government ministers have recently sought to crack down on forms of protest they deem a nuisance in response to actions by Extinction Rebellion and others. At the same time, they have championed freedom of expression, most notably in areas where ministers believe more conservative voices are not being heard.",News/Environment,Jury clears Extinction Rebellion activists who targeted commuters,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/10/jury-clears-extinction-rebellion-activists-who-targeted-commuters
12/11/2021,"Boris Johnson is under growing pressure to confirm whether parties were held in his Downing Street flat in defiance of Covid rules during last year’s lockdowns. The prime minister’s former adviser, Dominic Cummings, claimed on Friday that photos could come to light proving such gatherings were held. On the day that Cummings dramatically left his job in Downing Street in November last year, blaring music and aides chatting were heard in the No 11 residence where Johnson lives with his wife, Carrie, sources have said.  Separately, the Guardian has been told a “wine and pizza” party attended by Tory advisers was held in Downing Street after a Covid press conference during the first lockdown, in spring 2020. No 10 said the prime minister was in his flat “solely with his family” on the evening in question and the spokesperson denied knowledge of any gathering. Another insider suggested there were “various little drinks things” in breach of rules preventing social gatherings during 2020, with press office staff in particular tending to open a bottle of wine on Friday evenings, especially if they were working late. They said it would have been impossible for Johnson not to notice such gatherings as he had to walk past on his way up to the 11 Downing Street flat. “There’s literally no other way he could get to his flat,” the source said. The prime minister has consistently denied breaches of Covid rules, but this week his aides were exposed as having laughed and joked about a party on 18 December, which is now under investigation. Asked on Friday whether Johnson had been present at any social gatherings in his residence during lockdowns or restrictions on contact, his official spokesperson said: “No.” The spokesperson declined to say whether Johnson had known about the 18 December event, saying it would be covered by the independent investigation by Simon Case, the cabinet secretary. The Guardian also understands that Jack Doyle, Johnson’s chief spin doctor, tried to quit his post on Friday after it emerged he attended the party to thank staff and handed out mock awards, including for the “best dressed”. The December event went on late into the night, with dozens of staff drinking, swapping secret Santa presents and playing party games, it is understood. Doyle’s resignation was rejected by the prime minister, two sources said, contrasting with the approach taken earlier this week when the government’s Cop26 spokesperson, Allegra Stratton, was forced to stand down in a tearful address outside her home. “The PM wouldn’t have it,” a source said. Asked whether Doyle had tried to step down, Johnson’s spokesperson said: “Not that I’m aware of.” Doyle did not comment. No 10 said the prime minister still had full confidence in him. Insiders believe Johnson is resisting pressure for any more resignations. However, Stratton said in leaked footage four days after the 18 December party that she “went home”, leading to some Tory MPs calling for those who were allegedly there – such as Doyle and No 10’s head of broadcast, Ed Oldfield – to face the sack. Charlie Falconer, Labour’s former shadow attorney general, asked how Johnson could possibly retain confidence in Doyle after he presided over “days of No 10 briefing” that there was no party and no rules were broken. Cummings said there were “lots of pictures of the parties which will inevitably get out” and that invitations to the 18 December event were sent to staff in other Whitehall departments. He added that Johnson knew about it and would have had to walk past the area where it was held to go upstairs to his own flat. Cummings claimed the prime minister had “tried to lie his way out” by denying any knowledge of the event but was boxed into a corner due to the footage unearthed this week. On Friday, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said Johnson was unfit for office, accusing the government of being “up to its neck in dishonesty”. “We’ve had lie upon lie in relation to the parties going on in Downing Street,” he said. “The question really is for Tory members of the cabinet, Tory MPs, to ask themselves: ‘Are they prepared to put up with this?’ “Are they prepared to go through the degrading of themselves and their party, to go out to the media, have to defend the indefensible, for months to come, or are they going to actually have the courage to challenge him and say: ‘You’re not fit for office.’” There are three gatherings under investigation by Case: the 18 December party; another believed to be a leaving do for an aide, Cleo Watson, on 27 November; and “thank you” drinks for staff working in the then education secretary, Gavin Williamson’s department on 10 December. Case said that “if during the course of the work any evidence emerges of behaviour that is potentially a criminal offence, the matter will be referred to the police”. However, other events took place that are not being looked into, including a party at Conservative campaign headquarters on 14 December – the same day it was announced that London would be going into tier 3, with social mixing between households already banned.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson pressed to say if there were parties in his flat during lockdowns,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/10/pressure-piles-on-boris-johnson-to-confirm-awareness-of-no-10-parties
