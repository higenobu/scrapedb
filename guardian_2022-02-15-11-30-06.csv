2/15/2022,"San Francisco police used DNA collected as part of a rape exam to link a woman to a crime, possibly violating her constitutional rights, the city’s district attorney alleged on Monday. The department’s crime lab entered the DNA profiles of potentially thousands of sexual assault victims over “many years” to a database that is used to identify suspects, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. District attorney Chesa Boudin, who said his office first learned of the practice last week, told the newspaper such use of victims’ DNA could violate the California’s Victims’ Bill of Rights as well as constitutional laws related to unreasonable searches and seizures.  The woman’s DNA, which was collected in a rape exam as part of a domestic violence and sexual abuse case several years ago, was used to link her to a felony property crime in the city. Police identified her in the crime based on evidence from the rape exam, Boudin said. The district attorney expressed concerns the practice would deter victims of sexual assault, which is widely underreported in the US, from coming forward. “Law enforcement retaining and using DNA collected from survivors’ sexual assault exams to incriminate them hurts survivors,” Boudin said on Twitter. “Public safety demands that we support sexual assault survivors and end any practices that dissuade them from coming forward.” Law enforcement retaining and using DNA collected from survivors' sexual assault exams to incriminate them hurts survivors.Public safety demands that we support sexual assault survivors and end any practices that dissuade them from coming forward.https://t.co/uBEz38MCT3 Bill Scott, the San Francisco police chief, told the Chronicle the woman could have been identified in the property crime via DNA found in a different database, rather than a profile collected from a rape exam. Scott also said the department “would thoroughly review the matter” and report back to him and the district attorney’s office. State senator Scott Wiener, who represents the city, said lawmakers were seeking to determine whether a change in state law was needed to prevent the practice. “Getting a rape kit can be re-traumatizing. Having that DNA placed in a database for future use creates yet another incentive not to do it. It’s unacceptable,” he said on Twitter.",News/US news,Police reportedly link woman to crime using DNA taken from her rape kit,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/14/san-francisco-police-woman-crime-dna-rape-kit
2/15/2022,"The Australian government used a fraud conviction to attempt to deport an otherwise “model” New Zealand citizen who has lived in Australia for 40 years, with three Australian children and an Australian wife, and has not returned to his birth country since he was 17. The Morrison government is using the final days of parliament to attempt to harden its “character test” policy, which automatically cancels the visas of non-citizens, primarily New Zealand citizens, who are sentenced to more than 12 months’ imprisonment.  The policy has been a huge point of contention between the two nations, souring relations, and prompting direct rebukes to prime minister Scott Morrison from his New Zealand counterpart Jacinda Ardern. Last week, the government lost a case in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to deport a 47-year-old New Zealand man, who was convicted in 2021 of defrauding his own small business, but had no other criminal history and was a “very low” risk of reoffending. The man was “otherwise exemplary in his behaviour” and a “loving and caring father and husband who has contributed significantly to the community”, tribunal deputy president Stephen Boyle said. The man’s lawyers argued before the tribunal that immigration minister Alex Hawke’s refusal to revoke the automatic cancellation in November threatened to separate the man from at least one of his children and take his wife and immediate family away from their school, relatives and friends. His lawyers appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, arguing the decision was against the best interests of his children, that their client and his family were heavily established in Australia, posed no ongoing risk to the community, and the man had not committed offences of violence, drugs or abuse. “[He] is not a violent criminal,” they argued. “[He] was not involved in drugs and has no other criminal record. He is not a member of a group involved with criminal conduct nor was he involved in human trafficking or vilification of any sector of the Australian community.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “[He] does have an Australian wife, three Australian children and an extended network of family and friends which has grown from his many productive years as a respected citizen and taxpayer in his community. He is presently paying for his error in prison and there is no suggestion that he will ever repeat his mistakes when his sentence is finished.” The AAT decided in the man’s favour, finding that the considerations in favour of allowing him to remain in Australia outweighed those against. It revoked the cancellation and allowed him to stay in the country. Australia’s policy of deporting non-citizens has been the source of longstanding trans-Tasman tensions. The number of visa cancellations under the policy has skyrocketed in less than a decade. Almost half of the 946 visas cancelled under the policy last financial year were New Zealand citizens. Those numbers will increase further if the government succeeds in its current attempt to harden the law. The Morrison government is currently attempting to push through the Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test) bill 2021, which would allow it to cancel the visas of those who are sentenced to less than one year behind bars. The changes would also apply the policy to additional offence types. The Law Council of Australia has criticised the changes as “disproportionate and unnecessary”. In 2020, Ardern publicly rebuked Morrison over the deportation policy, declaring that New Zealand would “own our people [and] we ask that Australia stops exporting theirs”. More recently, prominent Māori leader Matthew Tukaki, the executive chairman of the National Māori Authority, said Australia was attempting to turn New Zealand into a “dumping ground” for criminals. Tukaki suggested the Ardern government should “turn the planes around”.",News/Australia news,Australia tried to use fraud charge to deport otherwise ‘model’ NZ citizen who has lived here for 40 years,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/15/australia-tried-to-use-charge-to-deport-otherwise-model-nz-citizen-who-has-lived-here-for-40-years
