IRPIN, Ukraine—This suburb northeast of Kyiv has become one of the most fiercely contested and symbolic battlegrounds of Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine. It was claimed this week that Ukrainian forces had succeeded in vanquishing the invaders after hundreds of civilians were slaughtered in the Russian advance on the capital city. A few days after the mayor announced that Irpin had been liberated, we set out to see for ourselves. After a 20-minute drive from Kyiv on Thursday, a French colleague, myself, and our driver Sasha arrive in Stoyanka, on the western edge of the capital. The place is devastated: A gas station has collapsed under shelling, burnt-out vehicles are spread on the highway leading to Jytomyr. This is one of the last checkpoints on the road to Irpin. The exhausted members of the Territorial Defense manning it try to dissuade us from going any further. “It’s not safe there!” warns Viktor, a twentysomething carrying an AK-74 on a sling. He invites us for a coffee in their base, a former Georgian restaurant called Radio Tbilisi. We share a cigarette and discuss our idea of going to Irpin. He disapproves. The whole city has not been declared safe and it remains within range of artillery and rockets. After weighing the risks, we decide to try our luck nonetheless. “It’s your responsibility,” sighs Viktor, as he shakes our hands. A winding road through a forest takes us to the entrance of Irpin. As we approach the city, Sasha stops the car. Roughly 500 meters up ahead, a black car bearing a spray-painted white “V” is blocking the road. Its windows seem shattered, its trunk is open. We hesitate. “It could be the Russians,” our driver says wearily. About five minutes later, a Ukrainian soldier emerges from the forest. We ask him if it’s safe to progress any further. He shrugs. “Maybe.” We decide to go for it. A few miles ahead, we encounter members of Ukraine’s special forces clearing out the city. After a bit of negotiating, their commanding officer, Phil, agrees to show us around the town. “I’ll only be able to take you around the area we’ve cleaned. The rest of the city is not safe,” he said. We set out on foot for a nearby two-story house, where soldiers are taking a break. Phil barks orders in Ukrainian, and the men start picking up their gear. One of them shows off his Savage sniper rifle with child-like enthusiasm. “It’s American!” he tells us with a smile. Once they’re ready, Phil turns to us: “Have you guys ever seen a body without a head? It’s not pretty.” We’ve been warned that there are four civilians lying dead further up the road, killed by either shrapnel or snipers. According to the mayor of the town, Oleksandr Markushyn, between 200 and 300 residents of Irpin have been killed since the beginning of Russia’s invasion. “Let’s go,” says Phil. We snake through alleyways, keeping close to the walls of the houses. Every building in this residential area bears the scars of fighting: The windows are destroyed, the façades riddled with holes from bullets or shrapnel. Around the corner of a house, we come across a bus bearing a red cross that’s been shot at, its windows shattered. Inside, a teddy bear lies face down, covered in dirt. “They shoot at children, the fucking bastards!” a soldier exclaims. On the front seat of the bus, a first-aid kit has been opened, its contents scattered on the floor. We move further up the road. As we progress into the city, the rhythmic thud of air defense systems can be heard echoing through the surrounding forest. “It’s ours,” says one of the soldiers with a smile. We are taken through a building site where we encounter the first dead body, a man wearing blue jeans and a blue jacket. “Brace yourselves,” says Phil, as he points toward another body, a hundred meters ahead. It’s a man. His face has rotted away, exposing his skull. A part of the torso is missing. His belongings are scattered all around. Once we’ve received the all-clear from a spotter, we move ahead, covered at all times by a marksman. Behind us, soldiers are keeping watch. “Watch your feet,” a soldier tells me as we make our way through an open field. “For mines?” I inquire. “Yes, that kind,” as he points toward the dogshit that litters the place. He laughs. Around 50 yards ahead, the body of a man is rotting away, his ribcage exposed. Another, a woman, is laying face-down next to a small crater. Her body has been covered with a jacket. “A mortar killed them,” says Phil. As we stop to take pictures of the scene, one of the soldiers escorting us discovers yet another body behind a nearby fence: It’s a woman in a pink jacket, still clutching her purse. “She’s probably been there for a couple of days,” he says, as he hangs her belongings on a nearby post. To facilitate her identification later, he tells me. We walk back onto the main road, up to a gray Renault that, we’re told, has been run over by a Russian tank. Thankfully, no one seems to have been inside at the time. A school bag rests against the rear left wheel. That’s as far as we’ll go into Irpin. “The rest of the city is not cleared yet,” says Phil, as he points toward high-rise apartment buildings in the distance. On the way back, the Ukrainian soldiers insist on showing us a car that was supposedly stolen by Russian soldiers trying to flee the city. The car, a white BMW bearing a spray-painted “V” on its doors, is filled with laptops, phones, as well as ammunition. We’re told that the Russians looted the nearby houses on their way out of the city. We ask about the fate of the driver. “He was killed.” Despite our enquiries, we get no further details. After having been assured over the radio that the way is clear, Phil leads us back to the entrance of the city. As we enter our car, he waves at us and shouts “Glory to Ukraine!” before heading back toward Irpin. Read more at The Daily Beast.

4/2/2022,"President Biden has said Russia is “isolated from the world,” but the rest of the world doesn't necessarily see it that way. Driving the news: Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s friendly visits to the world’s two biggest countries — India and China — suggest that Russia is hardly a pariah.

And while the sanctions on Russia are crippling, they’re limited mainly to NATO members and other close U.S. allies like Australia, Japan and South Korea. Leaders from many other countries, including Brazil, Pakistan and South Africa, are much more open to Russia. What they're saying: As Lavrov was traveling to Delhi, the U.S. and Australia criticized India for discussing a rupee-ruble trade arrangement with Russia, which could undermine Western sanctions. “Now is the time to stand on the right side of history, and to stand with the United States and dozens of other countries, standing up for freedom, democracy and sovereignty with the Ukrainian people, and not funding and fueling and aiding President Putin’s war,” Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said, per Bloomberg. Between the lines: India is one of the U.S.' most valued strategic partners. But by working to protect its trade with Russia, and refusing to condemn the invasion of Ukraine, it's actively undercutting Washington's efforts to isolate Moscow. Where it stands: Lavrov said Russia, China and other like-minded countries would “move towards a multipolar, just, democratic world order.” Beijing reiterated that its relationship with Moscow — which is now even more vital for Russia due to the sanctions — “has no limits.” Meanwhile, OPEC countries elected to stand by a deal with Russia rather than comply with U.S. pressure to increase production. Saudi Arabia and the UAE, key members of that group, have both signaled support for Russia in recent days. Flashback: 144 countries condemned the invasion in a UN vote on March 2, but few world leaders have openly criticized Vladimir Putin since. Support for that UN resolution among not-Western countries “was quite thin,” Richard Gowan, UN director at the International Crisis Group, told the Washington Post. The big picture: If European countries are highly concerned about the boomerang effects of Russia sanctions on their own economies, so are African and Asian countries — many of whom don’t seem to view this as their fight. Russia is a top global exporter of energy, weapons and wheat. Several leaders, including Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni, have raised Western interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya in justifying their reluctance to criticize Russia. ""Don’t threaten me, and I will not threaten you,” Museveni said. Like this article?

4/2/2022,"WASHINGTON — After serving as White House press secretary for more than a year, Jen Psaki will leave the Biden administration for MSNBC, where she will serve as a host and on-air expert. The departure, first reported by Axios, is expected this spring. Psaki has held near-daily briefings since the start of the Biden presidency, and has generally been praised for her transparency. She had initially said that she would stay at her position for a year, but a number of overlapping crises — the coronavirus pandemic, the withdrawal from Afghanistan and, most recently, the war in Ukraine — appear to have extended her tenure. The news outlet Puck had previously reported that Psaki was in talks with both CNN and MSNBC, and there was even speculation that she might replace MSNBC primetime star Rachel Maddow, who is stepping back from nightly hosting duties. Psaki will join a cable news landscape crowded with alumni of high-level Washington politics. CBS recently hired former Trump White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, a decision for which it was criticized by some of the network’s own employees. And Symone Sanders, former top spokesperson to Vice President Kamala Harris, will start hosting her own program on MSNBC in May.",Politics/Yahoo News,Psaki leaving White House for MSNBC,https://news.yahoo.com/psaki-leaving-white-house-for-msnbc-151447427.html
4/2/2022,"Police and school officials in Wilmington are investigating a “serious and disturbing physical altercation” inside a boys’ bathroom this week that left the superintendent of schools “appalled,” not only because of the incident, but because some students recorded video and posted it online. In a letter to the school community dated March 30th, Superintendent Glenn Brand said the incident happened on Tuesday and investigators are working to identify the students involved. Video sent to Boston 25 indicates a student was picked up inside the bathroom and had his head forced into a toilet inside a stall in the bathroom. “I am truly appalled by the actions of these students which are unacceptable and do not represent the core values of this educational community,” said Supt. Brand. ”It is my expectation that each and every one of our students has the right to attend a school that is safe and supportive. While I recognize that the vast number of our students consistently make appropriate choices to support such an environment, we will have zero tolerance for those that do not.” “The Wilmington Public School prioritizes, above all else, the safety, well-being and respect of all of our students and staff,” said Supt. Brand. “It is therefore with tremendous disappointment that I write to inform you of a serious and disturbing physical altercation that occurred in one of the boys’ bathrooms (Tuesday),” said Brand. “Not only is the incident itself concerning, but also that some of our students recorded the altercation and posted this online.” “All students who are found culpable will be held fully accountable and appropriate disciplinary action will be taken as well as the removal of appropriate privileges that are afforded to those students,” said Supt. Brand. “I assure you that we will pursue relevant legal actions should such be deemed warranted following the investigation.” The superintendent also alluded to other recent trouble at the school. “This incident comes in the wake of a number of other concerns recently involving troubling student behavior. Everyone has an obligation to help foster the type of school environments that our students deserve, including our staff, families and most importantly, our students themselves,” said Brand.
