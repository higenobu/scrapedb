12/25/2021,"An incredible £500,000 has been raised for climate justice good causes by generous Guardian and Observer readers, in the space of just over a fortnight since the launch of the 2021 charity appeal. Nearly 6,000 people have so far donated to the appeal, which will be shared between four charities: Practical Action, Global Greengrants Fund UK, Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, and Environmental Justice Foundation.  The theme this year is climate justice, inspired by stories of people and communities uprooted by climate volatility, whether flooding, wildfire, melting ice or drought, and supporting charities working with those most affected by environmental loss. “On behalf of all Practical Action’s staff and the communities we work with, I’d like to say a huge thank you to Guardian and Observer readers for their support,” said Sarah Roberts, chief executive of Practical Action. “The money will help the world’s most vulnerable people living at the sharp end of the climate crisis gain vital new skills to adapt their lives to their new environmental reality.” Dr Paul Wilkin, head of ecosystem stewardship at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, also paid tribute to readers: “We are blown away by people’s generosity for this year’s appeal. We know that our planet is under immense strain from biodiversity loss and climate change so these funds will help us to hit the accelerator on our work in Madagascar and for that we are incredibly grateful,” Introducing the appeal earlier this month the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, wrote: “The stark truth is that the world’s developing countries have seen the vast majority of the death and destruction caused by climate-induced disasters, and yet they are responsible for a tiny fraction of global emissions.” She added: “The richest countries pollute most but it is in the poorest where climate change is most harshly felt, through extreme poverty, food and water insecurity and the displacement of millions of people from their homes.” The appeal continues until early January.",News/Society,"Guardian and Observer climate justice charity appeal raises £500,000",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/25/guardian-and-observer-climate-justice-charity-appeal-raises-500000

12/25/2021,"Across three Sunday nights last summer, Sean Bean was remarkable. BBC One’s Time saw him play a teacher jailed for killing someone while drunk-driving. With Jimmy McGovern’s script often leaving him silent and alone in his cell, he painted an astonishingly affecting portrait of the regret and terror of a previously respected professional banged up with veteran criminals – and he frequently did so using expressions alone. How is it to try to grab the audience entirely through looks? “As you get older, it’s sometimes a bit easier!” says Bean, 62, with a laugh. “When I started out, I used to count up how many lines I had and want some more. Now, it’s: ‘Oh, fuck, do I have to remember all that?’ So I don’t mind silence.”  Is it not technically harder to convey everything facially, though? “Yeah, it is,” says Bean. “But if the character is alone, it’s about trying to think what they are thinking. You can draw on situations in which you have felt alone, or sad, or nervous. That can be uncomfortable, but it gets you to the truth.” As well as fewer lines to learn, Time also allowed Bean to reach the makeup trailer later. As a leading man, his time before shooting is usually spent trying to look as good as possible. Here, he needed to look rough. “It’s not as if I didn’t have to do anything. I shaved each day but aimed to get the effect of someone using a cheap razor in a little cracked mirror in their cell,” he says. “You do have to wear some makeup or you look a different texture from everyone else. But I put on the bare minimum, nothing too flattering. You want to look like someone who’s exhausted and in shock. That wasn’t too difficult some mornings!” Bean deliberately chose not to speak to any prisoners as part of his preparation for playing Mark Cobden – who is often the only person on his wing experiencing incarceration for the first time. “I wanted the locations – the cells, corridors, exercise yard – to be new and shocking to me, as they are to him. I wanted just to react to what was around me,” he says. The drama intercuts the experiences of Cobden and Eric McNally, his supervising prison officer, played by Stephen Graham. Their scenes together are acting as grand slam final tennis, each participant judging whether to match the pace of the other player or change it. Watching Time called to mind theatrical experiments in which actors have swapped the main parts in a play on alternate nights – the king and Bolingbroke in Shakespeare’s Richard II, the brothers in Sam Shepard’s True West – and I fantasised about seeing the drama with Bean as the prison officer and Graham as the inmate. Was the casting ever up for discussion? “It was always me for Mark and him for Eric. But it would be really interesting. You should ask Jimmy about remaking it that way.” Four years ago, in another McGovern drama, Broken, Bean played Father Michael Kerrigan, a Merseyside Catholic priest forced to double as a sort of social worker because of state and council cuts. Time and Broken are linked by Mark and Michael having been baptised into the same faith: Michael is a Catholic believer who struggles with doubts, while Mark has lost his faith but is tempted by a prison chaplain to lapse from atheism. Bean, who grew up in a practising Catholic family in Sheffield but was deemed “too out there” as a child to be encouraged towards the priesthood (as McGovern was), says: “The church offers Mark a lifeline. Jimmy McGovern claims not to believe in religion, but Catholicism is a thread in his work. In Time and Broken, there’s a tension between what the characters say they believe or don’t believe and what they actually think.” Where Father Michael is seen by society as a good guy and Mark Cobden as a bad man, the truth is far more complex. “They’re both very self-critical, and a mix of fallibilities and good qualities,” says Bean. “That ambiguity is what makes Jimmy’s characters so rich. And we’re all like that, aren’t we? We all like to think we have mostly good bits with a few bad bits – but others may think we have more downs than ups.” Time was his third primetime BBC collaboration with McGovern. Before Broken, there was 2012’s Tracie’s Story, which gave Bean his boldest screen role. Known as an action actor – the titular 19th-century soldier in ITV’s Sharpe, Ned Stark in Game of Thrones – he played, in blond wig and false breasts, Tracie, the trans alter ego of an English teacher. There are increasing calls for authentic casting, in which the identities of actor and character match. But for McGovern alone, Bean has played a priest, a prisoner and a transexual, none of which he has been. Would he defend pretence? “I think so. I come from a generation that started in repertory theatre, playing a different role each week. The aim was to play as many parts as possible. Whereas there’s a tendency now to argue that characters can only be played by someone like them,” says Bean. “I think that is restrictive and counterproductive. We risk getting into a situation where drama is dictated more by which boxes are ticked than the story being told. I often think that, if I did Tracie’s Story today, there’d be an uproar. I have a feeling it would be questioned and wouldn’t even be made, but it’s one of the roles I’m proudest of. It seems such a shame if actors can’t play a range of parts.” While in Time, Broken and Tracie’s Story, Bean was unable to draw on personal experience, the four-part BBC drama he is shooting with Nicola Walker – written and directed by Stefan Golaszewski, who made the BBC Two hit Mum – is called Marriage. Is it painful or useful that Bean is currently on his fifth? “Well,” he laughs, “the show is about a longterm, 27-year marriage, which isn’t something I know about.” His lengthiest stretch of matrimony so far is seven years. “It’s about the small things that happen in a marriage, how you stay together. There are really few words in this. It’s all in the silences and pauses. So it’s another very different shift for me, which is what I like.”",Arts/Television & radio,"Sean Bean on Time, makeup and his trans role: ‘If I did it today, there’d be an uproar’",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/25/sean-bean-on-time-makeup-and-his-trans-role-if-i-did-it-today-thered-be-an-uproar
12/25/2021,"Ikeep a list of words that are strange to me. Any time I find one I half-know or do not recognise, it goes in the list. I find its existence reassuring, as if having more words at my disposal will make it easier to decode whatever confusing things happen to me each day. The best word on my list is velleity. I found it in Don DeLillo’s Underworld (1997), in a section where a Jesuit priest is explaining to the main character, Nick Shay, the value of knowing the names for those things in danger of being lost to eternity. The priest teaches the word “velleity” to Nick. “Volition at its lowest ebb,” he calls it. “A small thing, a wish, a tendency.” He uses it in relation to his own life, to express regret at how it has passed. He has prayed a lot, sure, but what tangible things has he done in this world?  This year I’ve spent more time in Anglican churches than I have in the rest of my life combined. I haven’t converted, I don’t think. But I have been researching people in their 20s who have done, and it quickly became clear that without going to church I would miss crucial aspects of what it meant to become a Christian. And so, despite my initial wariness about structured religion, I started accompanying those I was interviewing not just to Sunday services, but the daily offices: morning prayers, evening prayers and compline (the night prayer). The first few services I was bored. I believed prayer to be a waste of thought. I spent the duration worrying, or feeling hungry, or both. I stared at the faded scars and burns across my hands and tried to remember how I got them. Gradually, though, I found myself taking an interest. I started to look forward to the prayers of penitence, recited in chorus by the congregation. I liked to say, “We confess we have sinned.” To say, “We have not loved our neighbours as ourselves”, admitting (half out-loud, half in private) to all the minor acts of unkindness we had inevitably carried out that week. I enjoyed the intercessions, too – the structured sequence of prayers, written by members of the congregation each week, which follow the pattern of prayers for the Church, then for society at large, for the local community, for any who suffer, and finally, for the communion of saints. The intercessions kept up with the news – prayers for the England team during the Euros, for NHS staff, for the families of refugees lost crossing seas. It was a grand picture that moved me: in the 16,000 Church of England buildings across the UK, which were reopened in July 2020 after the first period in 800 years without public worship in England, all these groups of people were closing their eyes and pressing their hands together in contemplation of those they did not know. Prayer did not stop during the pandemic, however. Between March 2020 and March this year, the Church of England’s various prayer apps were accessed 8m times, a 50% increase on the previous year. My Christian friend likes to phrase it in counterfactuals: what if prayer doesn’t do nothing? I posed this to someone else, whose apostasy came in his early 20s. “Yeah, what if,” he said, his voice empty of anything. “What if?” Having prayed each night of his childhood, he now finds the complacency necessary to trust you are “doing really valuable things by praying for the rest of the world” – at best deluded, and at worst dangerous. But most of the Christians I spoke with do not see prayer as efficacious. Instead, it is a response to the paralysis they feel when confronted with sickness, death or violence. “I’ll pray for you,” they say, and find it has more weight than “I’m sorry”. One of my close friends practises the metta bhavana, the Buddhist “loving-kindness” meditation. Like the intercessions, there are five stages. First, you meditate on yourself. Then on someone you love platonically, someone you feel neutral towards, someone you dislike, and then finally, the whole world. At each stage, you chant the following in your head: “May you be well, may you be happy, may you progress upon your path.” My friend knows their meditating cannot ensure the happiness of others, or of themselves. But it is a way of releasing hard emotions, and feeling momentarily connected to the disparate lives external to their immediate circumstances. I don’t think the Jesuit priest in Underworld was right. I don’t believe dealing in small things such as wishes makes you “low-willed”, as he expressed it. Velleity means desiring things you cannot hope to get. There is something in that impracticability I find serious, strengthening. Velleity is the closest word I have for the approximation of prayer I find myself moving towards: not a replacement for action, but a distinct act in itself. Sending out thoughts to people I miss or have hurt or will never meet. Knowing it has no power, but doing it anyway.
