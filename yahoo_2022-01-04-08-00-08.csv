1/4/2022,"⚡️ Read the full article on Motorious While the tornado which hit Bowling Green, Kentucky was a horrific event primarily because of the homes and livelihoods which were lost, we and many other enthusiasts mourned the loss of the rare and highly sought after C8 Corvettes damaged in the storm. Some were hoping GM would sell those mid-engine sports cars at a reduced price, kind of like when you go to a dent and scratch furniture store, but that was never in the cards. Learn about the radical new plan to take away private cars here. Instead, GM has crushed all the damaged C8 Corvettes rather than have the potentially defective cars end up in consumers’ hands. That might seem like an odd decision since people wreck Corvettes and they end up in salvage yards, then are fixed and sometimes not very well. While that might seem like the same thing, the truth is those Corvettes wrecked by customers weren’t in the possession and control of GM, so the automaker couldn’t do anything about them. Once a car is delivered to a customer it’s pretty much the new owner’s problem, barring anything covered by the warranty or found to be caused by faulty manufacturing practices. Two photos taken by Kornel J Werner and posted on Facebook show dozens of C8s, most if not all without doors, front clips, and a few other parts all lined up neatly like they’re in front of a firing squad. Those cars were damaged in the storm and have already been crushed, so there’s no convincing GM to stop like how the electric car people tried to stop the automaker from destroying the EV1. Maybe Michael Moore can make a movie about this automotive industry coverup? Sadly, this means at least this many customers who have been waiting for their new C8 Corvette are going to be waiting even longer. Sign up for the Motorious Newsletter.

1/4/2022,"A controversial law professor at the University of Pennsylvania is taking heat—yet again—for her racially insensitive comments. This time, Amy Wax was called out for being xenophobic in a recent interview with Glenn Loury, a social sciences professor at Brown University, and was quick to clap back at her critics. But her “defense” only made things worse, when she directly stated that because “most” Asian Americans support Democrats, “the United States is better off with fewer Asians and less Asian immigration.” The social media backlash was swift, with former President Donald Trump’s niece Mary Trump even chiming in. “It helps explain the situation this country finds itself in that an Ivy League university allows the morally and intellectually bankrupt racist #AmyWax teach the next generation of American lawyers. There should be consequences for this kind of hateful rhetoric @pennlaw,” she wrote. It all started with the Dec. 20 episode of The Glenn Show, during which Wax discussed U.S. immigration, insisting that it’s difficult to welcome people into Western societies if they do not share the same values—an idea she also shared in a recent speech. “It’s just harder to assimilate those people or to have confidence that our way of life will continue if we bring a lot of people in who are not familiar with it. These are not original ideas on the [political] right,” Wax told Loury. “This might result in a shift in the racial profile of people who come in. Obviously, we’ll have fewer people from Africa. We’ll have fewer people of some parts of Asia, and it’ll be more white—not that many white people want to come to the United States.” Specifically, Wax referred to South Asian elites migrating to the U.S., whom she differentiated from migrants traveling from Latin America. “[We] have to distinguish mass-immigration, which we’re getting from the Hispanics, south of the border, which I think poses different questions and challenges from the Asian elites that we’re getting,” she said. “It doesn’t mean that the influx of Asian elites is unproblematic. I actually think it’s problematic. …I think it’s because there’s this…danger of the dominance of an Asian elite in this country, and what does that mean? What is that going to mean to change the culture? “Does the spirit of liberty beat in their breast?” she continued. Wax considered the spirit of liberty to be “people who are mistrustful of centralized concentrations of authority who have a kind of ‘don’t tread on me’ attitude, who are focused…on our freedoms, on our liberties, on sort of small scale personal responsibility who are non-conformist in good ways.” The law professor noted that the idea of “wokeness” is an elite ideology and that “Asians tend to be more conformist to whatever the dominant ethos is.” The Same Hate That Targeted Muslims Is Turning on Asian Americans Now Then, Wax railed against Indians who stay in America after complaining that the country is racist. Her comments did not bode well with Loury’s audience. Loury posted an email he received from listener George Lee, who said he generally opposes undocumented immigration and usually agrees with Wax. But her latest rant “disturbed” him. “It is a bad thing for America to bring in immigrants who oppose America's basic values,” Lee concurred. “But…race and national origin are very poor proxies for cultural values that should be kept out of America.” Lee elaborated on the Asian immigrants who made racial strides in America, “who pounded the pavement and hit the airwaves to help stem the tides of racial essentialism and collective judgment in proposed legislation, ballot initiatives, and elections.” “By many accounts, Asians were key marginal contributors to some of these successes,” he said. “Asians do contribute to America’s scholarly, technological, and economic competitiveness, whose benefits we all share.” Wax then issued a rebuttal, saying Lee is “too optimistic about the influence of Asians and Asian immigrants.” “In the case of Asians in the U.S., the overwhelming majority vote Democratic,” Wax argued. “I find Asian support for these policies mystifying, as I fail to see how they are in Asians’ interest. We can speculate (and, yes, generalize) about Asians’ desire to please the elite.” “As long as most Asians support Democrats and help to advance their positions, I think the United States is better off with fewer Asians and less Asian immigration,” she added. Wax’s anti-Asian comments soon went viral on social media. Current Affairs Editor Nathan Robinson tweeted, “University of Pennsylvania law professor Amy Wax, who insisted she was not a racist despite praising the superiority of ‘European’ culture, now argues that the US needs ‘fewer Asians’ and we need to be asking ‘how many Asians are too many.’” She's arguing for explicitly racial immigration quotas designed to limit the number of nonwhite people because she thinks there are too many of them. She is a white nationalist! She wants a white nation! How much clearer can she be about that?! — Nathan J Robinson (@NathanJRobinson) January 2, 2022 “The most ironic part of this is that Wax complains about the decline of ‘bourgeois values,’ but then is opposed to the immigrant group (Asians) that are knocking it out of the park when it comes to those values (academic achievement, entrepreneurship, family focus, etc),” another Twitter user posted. Writer and scholar of race relations in history and law Brando Simeo Starkey wrote, “I’ve had the misfortune of having dinner with her in a group setting. She’s absolutely racist.” The University of Pennsylvania School of Law did not immediately return a request for comment to The Daily Beast. ‘Wokeness’ Battle Engulfs Prominent NYC Museum After Ex-Employee’s Rant The Washington Post reported that Wax has previously faced backlash for falsely claiming that Black students in their classes are rarely among the most successful students at Penn. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen a Black student graduate in the top quarter of the class, and rarely, rarely, in the top half,” she said in a 2017 interview with Loury. Due to Wax’s comments, a dean at Penn Law said that the professor would no longer teach required courses but only instruct electives. “Black students have graduated in the top of the class at Penn Law,” Dean Theordore Ruger said. “Contrary to any suggestion otherwise, Black students at Penn Law are extremely successful, both inside and outside the classroom, in the job market, and in their careers.” In her latest talk with Loury, Wax claimed that alumni of color are trying to get her fired.

1/4/2022,"Gov. Ron DeSantis, who’s spent $3 million this year zipping around the state in a $15.5 million plane that’s supposed to be used only for public business, must think Floridians don’t know what campaigning looks like. But if he’s confused, here are some tips: If there are snappy slogans on the podium instead of a simple, dignified state seal, that looks like campaigning. If there’s an audience of fans yelling, cheering and waving signs with veiled references to profane catchphrases instead of concerned experts and charts with critical public information, that also looks a lot like campaigning. If DeSantis is spitting out slogans instead of addressing his duties as this state’s elected leader — it looks like campaigning. Sending out fundraising information closely keyed to the appearance he just made? Looks like campaigning. Spinning fantasies about stolen elections and conspiracy theories involving respected federal health officials? Well … that sounds like lying. Also, sadly, campaigning. When the governor is hitting bakeries, barbecue joints and coffee shops across Florida instead of talking about the life-and-death concerns of millions of Floridians who entrusted him with the state’s highest office — maybe that’s not campaigning, but it’s certainly not working. He’s got plenty to say in his Twitter feed about all the bagels, sandwiches, coffee and unspecified “baked goods” he’s noshed on. Unemployment, the affordable housing crisis and the ever-present specter of the coronavirus, not so much. Worst of all, there’s been barely a flicker of concern for those Floridians who are dying of COVID — currently at a rate of about 16 people a day, which he seems to regard as barely worth noticing. Have you contacted any of those families, Gov. DeSantis? You do realize that when new cases soar, it’s only a matter of time before those invisibly grieving families begin to multiply exponentially? Leave aside that potential compassion deficit for a minute. Here’s what the law says: Public officials aren’t allowed to campaign on the state’s dime. They don’t get to use the state’s plane, bought for official duties, as an aeronautical pack mule bearing the burden of their personal ambition. (Why does he need a $15.5 million state plane?) He doesn’t get to co-opt the taxpayer-paid employees of the governor’s office and state agency heads as props and head cheerleaders, no matter how eager they may be to fulfil those roles. We need those people hard at work on serious state business. Groups like Integrity Florida, which recently spoke to the Sentinel about DeSantis’ use of the state plane and a potential “blurring of the lines” between public duty and political grandstanding, are right. He doesn’t get to use publicly funded resources for his own benefit. We understand it’s much more convenient for him. But it’s not one of the perks of the job. Good Lord, governor. You know this. You went to Harvard Law School. (We have heard about what happens when someone slips and says you went to Yale Law School. As another Florida newspaper recently learned, there is no faster way to hear from a Yale Law representative icily requesting a correction.) Governor, you also know how many Floridians are mourning today and how many are terrified by the sound of incessant coughing from another room. Maybe not in numbers, but in magnitude: You know it’s a lot. We don’t expect you to visit them all. We don’t expect you, Lord help them, to bring any of them muffins or maybe some orange juice. Just show a little compassion. A little decorum. A little acknowledgement that Florida is something more than a backdrop for the glory that is you. That Floridians are more than props. That you are putting their needs first, as they deserve. Correction: The print version of this editorial incorrectly identified the advocacy group Integrity Florida.

1/4/2022,"BERLIN (AP) — Two off-duty officers heading for a holiday in Canada together as a couple stepped up and helped restrain a fellow passenger who became rowdy on their flight last week, Austria's Interior Ministry said on Monday. The ministry said the passenger started issuing threats about two hours into the flight “and thereby endangered the safety of the plane.” After quietly reaching out to the plane's crew, the officers overpowered the disruptive passenger and kept him under observation until the plane landed and they were able to hand him over to Canadian authorities. In a statement, Lufthansa confirmed that the incident occurred on its Dec. 29 flight from Frankfurt to Toronto, and thanked the pair for their help. The German carrier declined to provide further details citing data protection.",World/Associated Press,Cop couple overpower rowdy passenger on flight to Canada,https://news.yahoo.com/cop-couple-overpower-rowdy-passenger-203137851.html
