3/18/2022,"A fourth London council has voted to oppose a new £2bn road tunnel under the Thames in east London, putting the capital’s mayor at loggerheads with local authorities over his biggest infrastructure project. Sadiq Khan accused councils of “want[ing] to put off tough decisions”, after Greenwich councillors voted overwhelmingly to call for all work on the Silvertown tunnel to be paused immediately. The vote means that both of the boroughs that would be primarily served by the tunnel now oppose it. Silvertown would link Greenwich peninsula with Royal Dock in Newham, where councillors two weeks ago voted for the tunnel to be cancelled. Lewisham and Hackney councils voted to oppose the tunnel in 2015. Khan insists the tunnel, in combination with new bus routes, road charging and emissions control schemes, will reduce congestion. But opponents say the new road would bring increased traffic, especially from lorries, and that any successor to Khan could eliminate the tolls he says will deter drivers. Khan spoke to journalists on Thursday about a City Hall analysis showing black and Asian Londoners were more likely to suffer the impacts of the climate emergency. He denied Silvertown, a major road project in the middle of some of the UK’s most diverse and deprived communities, stood in contradiction to his stance on environmental justice. He suggested opponents of the scheme did not understand the reality of living in the area, which lacks the “abundance of bridges and crossings” enjoyed by residents in the city’s wealthier western boroughs. “Those doctors campaigning against this may not live in that part of London, some of those people you are talking about who object may not be stuck in the traffic,” Khan said. “But the consequences of those who are stuck in traffic is poor quality air suffered by the children playing in the playgrounds around their schools, and the residents who can’t use their gardens safely because of the particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide.” Nevertheless, the Greenwich vote, after years of equivocation, leaves Khan politically isolated over Silvertown, a scheme he inherited from Boris Johnson’s tenure as London mayor. It is thought the council’s Labour leadership finally allowed a vote on the scheme after internal party wrangling, and fears it could be an issue in forthcoming local elections. “I can understand with elections approaching why people want to put off tough decisions,” Khan said. He said his administration had improved on Johnson’s plans, adding: “It would have been really easy, by the way, for me to cancel altogether those plans in 2016. But it doesn’t solve the problem in that part of London, it is putting your head in the sand. I’m not willing to do that.” Simon Pirani, of the Stop the Silvertown Tunnel group, rejected Khan’s claim that campaigners against the tunnel were not locals to Newham and Greenwich. The retired energy researcher, who lives in Greenwich, said that, on the contrary, he and fellow campaigners had struggled to raise awareness outside the immediate area. “We are thrilled that Greenwich council has changed its mind after its leadership has spent months trying to prevent a discussion about this,” Pirani said. “This gives us hope that the mayor of London too can come to his senses, even at this late stage, and pause the project for a proper review.”",News/UK news,Greenwich becomes fourth London council to oppose Silvertown tunnel,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/17/greenwich-fourth-london-council-oppose-silvertown-tunnel
3/18/2022,"Bounder, criminal, villain. Dandy, duke or diplomat. Peter Bowles, who has died aged 85 of cancer, could be all of these incarnations and often two or three of them at once. Always distinguished and highly regarded, Bowles himself ruefully admitted that he wasn’t a “star” until, aged 43, he played Richard DeVere, the former costermonger turned supermarket tycoon, in the BBC’s hit comedy series To the Manor Born (1979-81), written by Peter Spence, in which he contested the affections, and the superior social status, of Penelope Keith’s not so merry widow Audrey fforbes-Hamilton. The sure-fire premise of a classic class-conscious comedy was that Audrey, beset with debts and death duties, was obliged to downsize and set up home in the lodge on her own estate, now in the ownership of a monstrous arriviste. The ripples of resentment, compromise and green shoots of affection were the fuel of two brilliant comic performances; while Keith had already achieved national stardom in The Good Life – Bowles had turned down the role taken in that series by Paul Eddington – this was his moment, and he seized it with relish. Thereafter, he appeared sporadically on the West End stage as an authentic leading player, and initiated, often as a co-deviser, or “original idea” supplier, a string of major television serials including Only When I Laugh (1979-82), in which he starred with James Bolam and Christopher Strauli as one of three troublesome hospital patients under the supervision of Richard Wilson’s irascible doctor; The Irish RM (1983-85), in which he played a tetchily disposed army major serving as a resident magistrate in Northern Ireland (“Bowles Saves Channel 4” ran one headline after it opened to rave reviews and large viewing figures); and Perfect Scoundrels (1990-92), with Bowles and Bryan Murray playing likable conmen, latter-day Robin Hoods choosing only deserving victims. The phenomenon of a posh villain or cultured cad was nothing new. But Bowles could suggest complications beyond the superficially suave. He often paraded his charm as a veil for true menace or nastiness, as well as spivvery, and there was always a hint of phoniness around the smooth-talking self-assurance. Even off-stage or off-set he was always impeccably dressed in pronounced pin-stripes and high, starched collars. This was a result of his background. Both his parents were in domestic service, but only, as they used to say, to the quality. An only child, Bowles was born in Upper Boddington, Northamptonshire, 12 miles from Banbury, to Sarah Jane (nee Harrison) and Herbert Bowles. Herbert was valet to Drogo Montagu, son of the Earl of Sandwich, while Sarah was nanny to Lady Jeanne Campbell, Lord Beaverbrook’s granddaughter, whose mother married the Duke of Argyll. In 1940, the Bowleses moved to a two-up, two-down (with outside lavatory) in Nottingham, where Herbert now worked for Rolls-Royce and Peter was educated at High Pavement grammar school, alma mater too of the comedian John Bird. Encouraged by his own aptitude in school plays, and the example of two former pupils, Philip Voss and John Turner, who had both entered the acting profession with success, Bowles secured a scholarship to Rada in London. He shared a flat with Albert Finney (other contemporaries included Peter O’Toole, Richard Briers and Alan Bates) and he won the Kendal prize; he and Finney were promptly signed by the top US talent agency MCA. Bowles made his professional debut in Julius Caesar at Nottingham Rep in 1955 and debuts in London and New York the following year in Romeo and Juliet (in the small role of Abraham) with the Old Vic, where he made fast friends with his future colleagues James Villiers and Bryan Pringle. He thought he had found his pathway to classical theatre distinction at the Royal Court in 1960, when he appeared in John Arden’s This Happy Haven (as the only unmasked character) and with Rex Harrison in Chekhov’s Platonov. The Arden play was directed by William Gaskill, who also led classes in movement, masks, improvisation and play construction that Bowles relished. When Gaskill was appointed an associate director at the new National Theatre by Laurence Olivier, Bowles begged Gaskill to take him with other Royal Court actors, such as Joan Plowright, Robert Stephens and Colin Blakely, but Gaskill refused. Newly married, in 1961, to the actor Susan Bennett, and soon to start a family, he plunged into film and television, abandoning the theatre for 11 years after brief appearances with Coral Browne (in Bonne Soupe at Wyndham’s in 1961) and in a Séan O’Casey play at the Mermaid. He signed up as a movie gangster in Ken Annakin’s black-and-white The Informers (1963), followed by four major screen projects: Antonioni’s Blow-Up (1966), co-starring with David Hemmings (who played a photographer) and Vanessa Redgrave; Tony Richardson’s The Charge of the Light Brigade (1968), also with Hemmings and Redgrave, as well as Trevor Howard and John Gielgud; Richardson’s Laughter in the Dark (1969), adapted by Edward Bond from Vladimir Nabokov, in which a blinded art dealer’s wife gets her lover to move in with them (Nicol Williamson replaced a sacked Richard Burton during the shoot); and Peter Medak’s film of Peter Nichols’s A Day in the Death of Joe Egg (1970) in which he lent notable support as a well-meaning old schoolfriend to Alan Bates and Janet Suzman as the parents of a disabled child. His last major film was Sidney Lumet’s The Offence (1973), in which Sean Connery gave a great performance as a flaky police officer interviewing a child abuse suspect (Ian Bannen) in a psychodrama adapted by John Hopkins from his own stage play This Story of Yours. Two decades of television stardom were prefigured by the start, in 1976, of a 16-year association with Rumpole of the Bailey as Guthrie Featherstone QC MP and a much-loved episode of Rising Damp, starring Leonard Rossiter, in 1977, in which he wafted through as a cravat-wearing playwright called Hilary, dividing his flirtatious “rehearsal” attentions between Frances de la Tour and a long-haired Richard Beckinsale. He returned to the theatre in Alan Ayckbourn’s Absent Friends (1975) at the Garrick, humiliated by his wife (Pat Heywood), pushed to the limit by a bereaved and boring friend (Briers), and in 1976 filled his lunchtimes for six months with a hilarious turn as a north country Labour MP in Tom Stoppard’s Dirty Linen at the Almost Free in Rupert Street before it transferred – to run for seven years – at the Arts. He played another, more unctuous, Labour MP in Nichols’s Born in the Gardens at the Globe (now the Gielgud) opposite Beryl Reid as his bereaved mother, and won resounding plaudits as Archie Rice in John Osborne’s The Entertainer at the Shaftesbury in 1986, even if the character’s nasty edge was slightly blunted. He was much more at home as the macho medallion man Vic Parks, an armed robber turned television celebrity, in Ayckbourn’s Man of the Moment at the Globe (now Gielgud) in 1990, memorably crossing paths with the have-a-go hero of his crime in a suburban bank branch, Michael Gambon’s lolloping clerical nonentity. The morning after the transmission of Running Late (1992), a fine Simon Gray drama in which he played a television inquisitor unravelling in his personal life, Bowles bumped into the director Peter Hall, who invited him to join his company in a 1993 revival of Terence Rattigan’s Separate Tables at the Albery (now Noël Coward). His double of Rattigan’s wrecked newspaper columnist in one play and furtive groper of women in cinemas (“It has to be in the dark, and with strangers”) in the other attracted huge critical praise and heralded nine seasons of outstanding work with Hall’s company, playing major roles in Molière and Shaw, Coward and Chekhov, at the Theatre Royal, Bath, and in the West End. He also, in this Indian summer of his stage career, appeared for the producer Bill Kenwright in two popular warhorses, Anthony Shaffer’s Sleuth and Frederick Knott’s Wait Until Dark, re-imagining both leading roles as more sinister aspects of his smooth and menacing default setting. It was as though he had at last fully recovered from the disappointment of not joining the National 50 years earlier. He even resumed mild hostilities with Penelope Keith in a Hall revival of Sheridan’s The Rivals at the Haymarket in 2011; while Keith fired off her malapropisms imperiously, he glided elegantly around the stage in sleek grey silks as a forbiddingly dyspeptic, rakish Sir Anthony Absolute. There was a slight tailing off in his last stage appearance as Father Merrin in a pointless but ingeniously staged version of The Exorcist at the Phoenix theatre in 2017. The schlock horror of the 1973 movie and Bowles’s own decent performance were all upstaged by the overwhelming, pre-recorded voice of Ian McKellen as the Demon. Bowles, who collected British art and kept fit, he said, with “physical jerks”, was voted the Variety Club’s ITV personality of the year in 1984 and awarded an honorary doctorate by Nottingham Trent University in 2002. He published an anecdotal memoir, Ask Me If I’m Happy (2010), and a handbook on what he called “the job of acting”, Behind the Curtain (2012). He is survived by his wife, Susan, and their three children, Guy, Adam and Sasha.

3/18/2022,"When Jay got a phone call last week, the details were vague. “I was asked if I could come to Poland. All I was told was it involved helping evacuate Ukrainian children,” said the Canadian military veteran, who declined to give his full name because he hopes to carry out more rescue missions. “I didn’t have to think about it. Forty-eight hours later, I’m in Krakow.” In Poland, Jay joined other Canadian veterans as part of high-stakes mission to safely evacuate cancer patients to Canada. On Wednesday, a chartered plane carrying two children and their families touched down in Toronto, successfully capping a multi-day rescue effort, at times marred by bureaucracy and bad luck. Toronto’s Sick Kids, the world-leading paediatric hospital, will treat the children for their cancers and says it’s prepared to take as many as 15 children and has contacted other hospitals across the country. But the journey of those two children and their families highlights the complexity of such missions. “We’ve really been upside down and backwards in the last 10 days. It’s been an emotional rollercoaster because at times, we thought this whole thing wasn’t going to happen,” said Brian Macdonald, a military veteran and executive director of the aid group Aman Lara. The efforts began in earnest last week after Macdonald saw jarring images of hospitals being bombed by Russian forces. Since last summer, the non-profit, whose name is Pashto for “Sheltered Path” has helped evacuate Afghans seeking to feel their country after the Taliban took power. So far, the group has helped more than 2,000 escape. “We looked at the situation in Ukraine and figured we’d learned some skills in Afghanistan and that we could help,” said Macdonald. “And so we just reached deep into our network.” Macdonald found that Sick Kids hospital had connections to clinics and doctors in Poland, where many of the refugees were taking shelter. The Ukrainian community offered to find free accommodation and translators. And on 7 March, Macdonald called up Steven Day, a former commander with Canada’s elite special forces unit. Day, who oversaw mass evacuations as a ground force commander in Haiti in 2004 and in Lebanon in 2006, now runs Reticle, a security company that’s been helping Aman Lara with the Afghanistan evacuations. “When Brian called, I said let’s do it,” said Day. “Let’s rock and roll.” Everyone involved decided to work for nothing – all they needed was the money to cover expenses. It took a single phone call to a colleague for Day to line up a donor. Richard Hamm, a Toronto-based investment banker, put up $C200,000 (US$158,000) to cover the cost of a private plane after a Zoom meeting. “I’ve been in war. I’ve been a peacekeeper. I’ve been in disaster zones. I’ve seen it all,” said Day. “And I’ve seen the power of trust.” By Thursday, Jay was on the ground in Poland, visiting clinics to find families who were interested in travelling to Canada to continue cancer treatments. On Friday, the mission hit the first of many roadblocks. The team couldn’t get the travel paperwork sorted for the first prospective family – and they lost the plane they had lined up. “You have to pay for the aircraft 24 hours before it goes wheels up. That money is non-refundable,” said Day. “I couldn’t risk the donor’s money if we didn’t have all the paperwork done or the right patients. You can’t gamble $200,000.” The team soon learned the paperwork on the Canadian side could take as long as four days but, for the Polish clinics to triage a wave of incoming patients fleeing Ukraine, waiting days was impossible. As the team scrambled to find families that would be a good fit in Canada, they had to change aircraft providers three times in two days. Day eventually connected with James Newton at Vantage Aviation, a small UK-based company to help source a plane. When they found an aircraft, Day wired the money – but the transfer was delayed. “James cleaned out the company’s bank account to pay a German company for the plane. And the German pilots lifted off before I was paid by the donor,” said Day. “So I’m out 200 large. And James is out 200 large, all on a word of trust between two guys over the internet, who’ve never met face to face.” Further complicating matters on the ground, one of the children’s legal guardians was his father. Because of a rule that fighting-age males can’t leave Ukraine, the team had to find ways to hide the father from Polish security officers until they could get everyone on the flight. (Sick Kids hospital has not released any information about the children, citing the need for the families’ privacy.) Once the plane finally took off, Day says he was overwhelmed by a sense of calm. “As a commander, whether in a military mission or this sort of thing, you know you’ve done everything you can. I can’t change weather patterns. I can’t sort out a refuel. You just need to trust the team to get on with it.” For Jay, who spent sleepless nights working out logistics finding suitable patients and vetting possible airports to land the evacuation plane, his urge to help stems from a different conflict. When Afghanistan fell to Taliban forces over the summer, he was overcome by a sense of helplessness and frustration. The Canadian forces veteran had spent time in the country nearly a decade ago and felt the Afghans who had helped him and his fellow soldiers had been betrayed. “They fought beside us. They defended us, and now they were being hunted by the Taliban. It felt like they’d been abandoned,” said Jay. “When Russia invaded Ukraine, that same sentiment came back. I needed to do something. I wanted to help.” The United Nations estimates more than 3 million Ukrainians have fled their country, with the majority seeking shelter in Poland, Slovakia and Moldova. “If you look at the mountain, you’re going to get discouraged,” said Jay. “Personally, it’s just about taking on one impossible task at a time. You just focus on that. And when you look back, you realize you’ve actually made a difference.”",News/World news,‘I didn’t have to think about it’: the veteran bringing Ukrainian kids with cancer to Canada,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/canada-veteran-evacuating-ukrainian-kids-cancer
3/18/2022,"The footballer Emiliano Sala died as a result of a plane crash, having been overcome by toxic levels of carbon monoxide from the aircraft’s faulty exhaust system during an unlicensed commercial flight from France to Wales, an inquest jury has ruled. Sala’s family welcomed the jury’s conclusion and said that they were pleased that the coroner Rachael Griffin expressed concerns about safety issues that arose during the inquest. Speaking after the jury’s conclusions on behalf of Sala’s mother and two siblings, solicitor Daniel Machover said: “This inquest has exposed the complex facts leading to Emiliano’s untimely death. It has shone a bright light on many of the missed opportunities in the worlds of football and aviation to prevent his tragic death. “The family particularly note the jury’s findings that it is likely that both the pilot and Emiliano suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning and that Emiliano was deeply unconscious at the time of the accident, and that the poisoning was caused by a failure in the aircraft exhaust system. “The family also welcome the coroner’s decision to communicate to the relevant authorities her concerns about the safety issues arising from this inquest in order to prevent similar future deaths. No family should have to go through grief from a similar avoidable accident.” The jury was told that the flight was arranged as part of the Argentinian striker’s £15m transfer to Cardiff City, then in the Premier League, from the French Ligue 1 side Nantes. He was being flown by pilot David Ibbotson from France to Wales in a Piper Malibu on the night of 21 January 2019 when it crashed into the sea close to Guernsey. The footballer’s body was recovered from the seabed 68 metres down. Postmortem tests found he was overcome by carbon monoxide poisoning and died of severe head and chest injuries. The body of Ibbotson, 59, from Lincolnshire, was not found. Sala’s mother, Mercedes Taffarel, told the inquest that Cardiff had put “a lot of pressure” on Sala to complete the move quickly and he felt in the middle of a dispute over money between the Welsh and French clubs. Taffarel said that after the tragedy, relatives of Sala travelled to Guernsey in the hope that her son had somehow survived. “In the cold weather we walked on those islands calling his name, hoping to hear from him,” she said. The jury was told that Ibbotson held a licence that did not permit him to fly commercially or at night. On the flight out to France a loud bang came from the aircraft but Ibbotson did not tell the authorities. David Henderson, the businessman who arranged the flight, has been jailed for his part but, giving evidence via video link, he insisted he had not banned Ibbotson from warning air traffic control of problems to avoid his business dealings coming to the attention of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). He said it would have been up to Ibbotson to ground the plane if he thought it was not safe, and claimed he had forgotten he could not fly at night. Jurors were told that Ibbotson was also likely to have been overcome by carbon monoxide minutes before the plane crashed. Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) experts testified that they believed the most likely cause for dangerous levels of carbon monoxide getting into the cabin was a faulty exhaust system. Brian McDermid, an AAIB inspector, said pilots were encouraged to carry carbon monoxide detectors but this was not mandatory. “One of the problems of carbon monoxide is it’s odourless and in the cabin you may not be aware of its presence,” McDermid said. “Which is why we think the use of carbon monoxide detectors in light aircraft should be mandatory – at the moment they are not.” The flight was arranged by the football agent Willie McKay, a long-time client of Henderson, who was involved in Sala’s move to Cardiff. McKay claimed he organised the flight because he knew Cardiff City would not pay for it. He said: “I have used David Henderson for 14 years and he had never let me down. David Henderson was a top, top pilot and flew in the RAF and flew planes all round the world. The most important thing was to help Emi.”",Sport/Football,"Plane crash killed Emiliano Sala after he was overcome by fumes, inquest rules",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/17/plane-crash-killed-emiliano-sala-after-he-was-overcome-by-fumes-inquest-rules
3/18/2022,"As the Russian patron saint of artists who create works of dissent under the noses of dictators, Shostakovich is a timely composer to turn to – more so than the Emerson Quartet can have imagined when they programmed a trio of London concerts featuring the first nine of his 15 string quartets. The Emersons, who have announced they will retire as a quartet in October 2023, have forged a strong connection with Shostakovich’s music over the past four decades. Still, on this occasion that affinity took a little while to show. The Quartet No 1, always one of the briefest and sunniest of the 15, began with the texture well-blended to a fault and some of the tuning unclear, and with the first violinist, Eugene Drucker, rarely singing out above the rest. Things began to spark with the Quartet No 2; from the folksy opening melody onwards Drucker’s playing had more heft, and in the first movement the others lent the music an insistent swing. Everyone’s playing seemed to take on more character – even that of cellist Paul Watkins, who had provided the most distinctive voice in No 1. By the time Lawrence Dutton’s viola line was climbing up through the final chords of the work, the performance had taken on a persuasive intensity. That feeling continued after the interval into the Quartet No 3, written in 1946. This was where the concert caught fire. Now it was Philip Setzer in the first violinist’s chair, with Drucker playing second; Setzer dispatched the opening theme with an easy presence, without the laboured detail that can make Shostakovich’s chirpy melodies seem so arch. Here was the crispness and intention that had been missing in No 1. Belligerence was followed by lamenting, and it added up to a moving performance of a powerful response to war. Rounding off a heartfelt speech at the end, Drucker spoke of how Shostakovich’s music could perhaps be looked to right now for solace and meaning. Still, it was J S Bach the players turned to for their brief encore, his music as ever offering the possibility of consolation and equilibrium.  At the Queen Elizabeth Hall, Southbank Centre, on Thursday and Friday.",Arts/Music,Emerson String Quartet review – Shostakovich offers consolation and equilibrium,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/17/emerson-string-quartet-review-shostakovich-queen-elizabeth-hall
3/18/2022,"Keely Hodgkinson has warned her opponents that the World Indoors is not enough as she sets her sights on four major championship medals in 2022. The 20-year-old is a big James Bond fan and celebrated winning Olympic silver in Tokyo by attending the premier of No Time To Die and being invited by Aston Martin to drive the DB5 car used in the film. Having trained hard over the winter, Hodgkinson says she is ready to kick on again by winning her first global gold medal at the world indoors in Belgrade this weekend. But she also believes she can follow it up with medals this summer at the world outdoors in Eugene, Oregon, the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham and, potentially, the European championships in Munich. “I’d love four major medals,” she says. “It’s definitely physically possible to do all four. Mentally, we’ll see.” The world outdoors is No 1 and I really want to do the Commonwealths, as it is a home Games. With the Europeans we’ll see how the body and mind are coping. But I’d like to be there.” Last year, Hodgkinson announced herself to the world by taking the European indoor title and then running a British outdoor record of 1min 55.88sec to win Olympic silver. To keep her focus fresh for 2022, she wrote down a long list of the targets. The first was to break the British indoor 800m record, which she did by running 1:57.20 in Birmingham last month – the fastest time by a woman indoors for 20 years. The next was to win the world indoors. But that, she says, only hints at the scale of her ambition. “I did write down ‘world champion’, so that is an expectation for me,” she says. “Hopefully, I can go back and tick it off when I get home. I’ve set some goals but they’re pretty big – they are bigger than last year.” Some items on her bucket list have already been ticked off, including driving Bond’s Aston Martin. “They let me drive it on the roads of Milton Keynes,” she says. “It was the car that was used in the James Bond film, the DB5. There’s 25 worldwide and only one of them is road safe and that’s the one they used in the film. “I must have said something in an interview because Aston Martin got in touch on Twitter and said they would make it happen. It was very cool – and I went to the world premiere of the film as well.” Britain field a largely developmental team in Belgrade, but other potential medallists include Elliot Giles in the men’s 800m, the returning Katarina Johnson-Thompson in the women’s heptathlon, Lorraine Ugen in the women’s long jump and Daryll Neita in the women’s 60m. Twelve Olympic gold medallists from Tokyo are competing, including Shaunae Miller-Uibo in the 400m, the pole vault world record-holder, Mondo Duplantis, and the 100m Olympic champion, Marcell Jacobs, who takes on the world champion, Christian Coleman, over 60m in the race of the weekend.",Sport/Sport,Keely Hodgkinson sets target of four major championship medals in 2022,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/17/keely-hodgkinson-sets-target-of-four-major-championship-medals-in-2022
3/18/2022,"With the exception of a handful of works – the miraculous Octet, composed when the composer was just 16, a couple of the string quartets, early and late, and maybe one of the piano trios – Mendelssohn’s chamber music remains too little known. The string quintets, scored for the pairs of violins and violas with a single cello that Mozart opted for in his quintets, are superb examples of what that neglected music can offer. There are two of them, composed almost 20 years apart. The A major Quintet Op 18 dates from 1826, the year after the Octet, and a year before the first of Mendelssohn’s truly mature string quartets, the A major Op 13. (Through his career, the opus numbers given to Mendelssohn’s works sometimes bear little relation to the order in which they were composed.) Its opening movement has the same youthful buoyancy and effortless lyricism that characterises much of the Op 13 quartet, while its scurrying scherzo recalls the equivalent movement in the Octet. The B flat Quintet Op 87, written in 1845, was his penultimate chamber work and, it seems to me, one of his finest achievements – a score of tremendous scope and surging power with an intense slow movement as its centre of gravity. Though there are a few moments in the performances by the Doric Quartet and viola player Timothy Ridout when the textures seem muddier than perhaps they need to be, they generally do full justice to both quintets. They give full rein to the easy-going invention of Op 18, while treating its slow intermezzo, Mendelssohn’s 1832 replacement for the original second movement, with almost Beethovenian profundity, and the energy of their account of Op 87 is pretty irresistible, too. Shades, the Manchester Collective’s second release on the Bedroom Community label, is devoted to the two string quartets by Edmund Finnis, the second of which he composed for the group last year. Finnis describes the scores as “some of the most personal and intimate” pieces he has written. “Outcomes of something that I’m incapable of fully expressing with words.” The starting point for the first quartet was a reflection on William Byrd’s setting of a fifth-century hymn that forms the fourth of its five movements, while the second quartet arose out of some recordings of songs that Finnis had composed in his teens, and which he rediscovered when moving house. What the two works have in common is the wonderful refinement of the string writing, its airy lyricism and fragile, touching beauty.",Arts/Music,Mendelssohn: The String Quintets review | Andrew Clements's classical album of the week,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/17/mendelssohn-the-string-quintets-review-doric-quartet-timothy-ridout
3/18/2022,"Brazilian activists are outraged after Jair Bolsonaro – who has been accused of spearheading a cataclysmic attack on Indigenous rights – was honoured by his own government for his supposedly “altruistic” efforts to protect Indigenous lives. Bolsonaro was granted the Medal of Indigenous Merit on Wednesday in recognition of what the justice ministry called his attempts to defend Indigenous communities in the South American country. The same honour was bestowed upon key Bolsonaro allies, including his health, defence and agriculture ministers and the hardline institutional security chief, Augusto Heleno, who has accused Indigenous activists of committing crimes against the state by criticising the government’s policies overseas. Indigenous leaders reacted to the award with disbelief and exasperation, noting how Brazil’s far-right president had spent three years undermining its Indigenous and environmental protection agencies, Funai and Ibama, and promoting legislation that would open Indigenous territories to commercial development. The Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil criticised the government’s “contemptuous gesture”. “They want to destroy us at all costs and, as if that wasn’t enough, they now want to pay tribute to themselves in our name?” the group said, claiming Bolsonaro deserved only “the medal of Indigenous genocide”. Alessandra Korap, an activist from the Amazon’s Munduruku people, said Bolsonaro needed to be arrested, not honoured “for all the destruction he has inflicted on Indigenous people and the forest”. “Now he wants to use the Ukraine war [as justification] for allowing mining, oil and gas exploration, hydroelectric dams and soy plantations on Indigenous lands,” Korap added, in reference to recent moves to fast-track draft legislation allowing such activities. Alessandro Molon, the lower house leader of Brazil’s opposition, urged Congress to strip Bolsonaro of the medal. “It’s a mockery that the same government that is trying to legalise mining on Indigenous lands – endangering the existence of these utterly persecuted and mistreated people – has the nerve to award itself medals of ‘merit’ for all of the harm it has caused over the past three years,” Molon told the magazine Veja. “If Congress doesn’t overrule this absurdity it will be associating itself with this unprecedented assault on Indigenous people,” Molon said.",News/World news,‘Contemptuous’: anger in Brazil as Bolsonaro given Indigenous merit medal,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/contemptuous-anger-in-brazil-as-bolsonaro-given-indigenous-merit-medal

Until 2002, when it was identified after it sold in a garden statuary auction for a mere £5,200, it was revealed on Thursday. It is now valued for sale between £5m and £8m. “It is a miracle that Antonio Canova’s exceptional, long-lost masterpiece has been found, 200 years after its completion,” said Dr Mario Guderzo, a leading Canova scholar and former director of the Museo Gypsotheca Antonio Canova. “This work has been searched for by scholars for decades, so the discovery is of fundamental importance for the history of collecting and the history of art.” The sculpture will be auctioned by Christie’s this summer. Its sellers have not been named but are said to be a British couple who bought it to decorate their garden. Their rediscovery “brings to a conclusion a very particular story worthy of a novel, of a marble of significant historical value and great aesthetic beauty produced by Canova in the final years of his artistic activity,” Guderzo said. The story of the Recumbent Magdalene begins in 1819 when it was commissioned by Liverpool, whose interest and influence in the arts is best exemplified by the founding of the National Gallery under his government. After his death in 1828, Liverpool’s title and estate – including the Canova sculpture, were passed to his brother Charles, the third Earl of Liverpool, after whose death the sculpture was auctioned by Christie’s almost exactly 170 years ago, in 1852. In 1856 it was in the collection of Lord Ward, later the Earl of Dudley, who exhibited it in London and Manchester. After Ward’s death his estate and collection passed to his son, who at a moment of personal tragedy in 1920 sold his house, Witley Court, and its contents to Sir Herbert Smith, a carpet manufacturer. It was at this point that the attribution to Canova appears to have been lost, Christie’s said. Subsequent owners have included Violet van der Elst, an eccentric entrepreneur and campaigner who was instrumental in bringing about the abolition of the death penalty in England. The lost chapter continued until 2002 when the present owners heard rumours that their sculpture could be the highly sought-after Canova marble. They contacted Francis Outred, an art adviser, whose team uncovered its missing history. Canova is cherished by art historians and collectors for his compositional talents and in his ability to translate those compositions into marble. Writing about the Recumbent Magdalene in 1819, he said: “I exhibited another model of a second Magdalene lying on the ground, and almost fainting from the excessive pain of her penitence, a subject that I like very much, and that has earned me a lot of indulgence, and very flattering praise.” One of these admirers was the Irish writer and poet Thomas Moore, who wrote that Canova “took me to see his last Magdalen, which is divine: she is lying recumbent in all the abandonment of grief; and the expression of her face, and the beauty of her figure … are perfection.” Donald Johnson, Christie’s international head of sculpture, said the rediscovery was “a highlight within my 30-plus-year career in the field”. He said: “This sculpture represents an extensively documented commission from a major figure in British history, the prime minister Lord Liverpool, whose purchase of the Magdalene is a testament to the love that British collectors had always show for the work of the great neo-classical sculptor Antonio Canova.”",Arts/Art and design,Long-lost Canova sculpture bought for couple’s garden could fetch £8m,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/17/long-lost-canova-sculpture-bought-for-couples-garden-could-fetch-8m
3/18/2022,"Survivors have emerged from the basement of a theatre hit by a Russian airstrike in the besieged southern city of Mariupol – part of a furious bombardment of civilian targets in multiple cities over the past few days. Hundreds of people were hiding beneath the theatre, which was designated as a shelter for displaced civilians when it was struck on Wednesday. It is not known if there were injuries or deaths among those inside. Local officials said Russian airstrikes also hit a municipal swimming pool complex in the city. A satellite photograph from Monday showed the word “children” in large Russian script painted on the ground outside the red-roofed theatre building. To the north, at least 53 people have been killed over 24 hours in the city of Chernihiv, the local governor said. Ukrainian officials also reported artillery and airstrikes in the Kalynivka and Brovary suburbs of the capital, Kyiv. Early on Thursday a fire broke out in an apartment building hit by remnants of a downed Russian rocket in the Kyiv, killing one person and injuring at least three.Russian artillery destroyed a school and a community centre in Merefa, a city near the northeast city of Kharkiv, according to Merefa’s mayor. There were no known civilian casualties. The Kharkiv region has seen heavy bombardment as stalled Russian forces try to advance in the area. Under Russian control Russian invasion route Russian airstrike or shelling Russian attack or movement Ukrainian attack or movement  The world becomes increasingly concerned about more than 100,000 Russian troops that have accumulated on the Ukrainian border. Western intelligence agencies sound the alarm, though Vladimir Putin insists Russia has no plans to invade. On 22 February, Putin declared that Russia would recognise the Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent states, after Russia-backed separatists partially seized the regions. Ukraine and the west's worst fears are realised as airstrikes hit targets across the country, as far west as Lviv. By clicking on the dots on the map, you'll reveal more information about individual strikes and events. Russian forces invade Ukraine from multiple entry points: Belarus to the north, Russia to the east and Russian-occupied Crimea to the south. Russian forces move on several points on the first day of the invasion. Several key locations, including the Chernobyl exclusion zone, are captured by the Russian army. Russian troops enter parts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where they face strong resistance. After fierce fighting prevents them from seizing the Hostomel airbase on the first day of the invasion, progress is limited to the north-west of the capital. They are still, however, able to claim some land on the outskirts of the city. Elsewhere, fighting continues even as Russian progress slows. Russian forces move to encircle the southern city of Mariupol, although they enjoy less success in the north, where they abandon an attempt to take Chernihiv after heavy fighting. Russian forces advance on key cities including Kharkiv in the north-east, Kyiv in the north and Mariupol in the south. A large convoy of military vehicles approaches the capital, although progress is limited and logistical problems are reported. As the war enters its second week, Russia steps up shelling of civilian areas. Operations to envelop Kyiv remain the focus of Russia’s efforts, but the ISW reports three other aims: seizing Kharkiv, taking Mariupol and securing a “land bridge” in the south, and securing Kherson in order to set conditions for a drive west towards Mykolaiv and Odesa. Little progress is made over the first two weeks of March. Amid reports of lost momentum and low morale, Russian forces are consolidating positions with reinforcements and probing defences around Kyiv. Dozens of civilians are reportedly killed as Russian forces hit cities with artillery and airstrikes, seen as a new tactic in the face of limited advances on the ground. Russia is widely seen as making its best advances in the south, where Kherson becomes the first major city to fall under Russian control. On the other southern front, several buildings in Mariupol are flattened and people are left without water or power. Russia breaks ceasefires put in place to allow for evacuations from Mariupol and Volnovakha. As the conflict concludes its third week, Russia sends in reinforcements to tighten its grip around the key cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, which remain under Ukrainian control. Russian advances in the south contrast with difficulties its forces have faced in the north and north-east. Nowhere is this resistance stronger than in the increasingly fortified capital, Kyiv. Russia steps up its artillery and airstrikes on the city in an apparent attempt to degrade defending forces' capacity and morale. It is a strategy that has so far failed in other cities such as Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. Over the previous few months Russia had deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
3/18/2022,"Taking long naps could be a precursor of Alzheimer’s disease, according to a study that tracked the daytime sleeping habits of elderly people. The findings could help resolve the conflicting results of the effects of napping on cognition in older adults, with some previous studies highlighting the benefits of a siesta on mood, alertness and performance on mental tasks. The latest study suggests that an increase over time in naps was linked to a higher chance of developing mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s. The scientists think it is more likely that excessive napping could be an early warning sign, rather than it causing mental decline. “It might be a signal of accelerated ageing,” said Dr Yue Leng, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of California San Francisco. “The main takeaway is if you didn’t used to take naps and you notice you’re starting to get more sleepy in the day, it might be a signal of declining cognitive health.” The scientists tracked more than 1,000 people, with an average age of 81, over several years. Each year, the participants wore a watch-like device to track mobility for up to 14 days. Each prolonged period of non-activity from 9am to 7pm was interpreted as a nap. The participants also underwent tests to evaluate cognition each year. At the start of the study 76% of participants had no cognitive impairment, 20% had mild cognitive impairment and 4% had Alzheimer’s disease. For participants who did not develop cognitive impairment, daily daytime napping increased by an average 11 minutes a year. The rate of increase doubled after a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment to a total of 24 minutes and nearly tripled to a total of 68 minutes after a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, according to the research published in the journal Alzheimer’s and dementia. Overall, participants who napped more than an hour a day had a 40% higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s than those who napped less than an hour a day; and participants who napped at least once a day had a 40% higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s than those who napped less than once a day. Previous research, comparing postmortem brains, showed that those with Alzheimer’s disease were found to have fewer specialist neurons that promote wakefulness. Unusual sleep patterns, insomnia and poor quality night-time sleep are common for people with dementia, but the latest work showed that the link with napping remained even when night-time sleep was taken into account. “This suggested that the role of daytime napping is important itself,” Leng said. The authors said feeling increasingly drowsy during the day could be an early sign that changes were under way in the brain that were the precursors of dementia. Leng said it was not possible to rule out the possibility that napping was causing cognitive problems but there was “no obvious biological mechanism by which taking naps could cause Alzheimer’s”.",News/Society,"Long naps may be early sign of Alzheimer’s disease, study shows",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/17/naps-early-sign-alzheimers-disease-study
3/18/2022,"The US president, Joe Biden, has announced an $800m (£610m) package of arms to Ukraine as the west steps up military aid against invading Russia forces. The west’s military assistance to Ukraine began cautiously with helmets and flak jackets but now includes drones that can destroy Russian tanks and artillery from 50 miles away. The west has repeatedly refused to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine but is now supplying a range of powerful weapons. They include: These Turkish-made drones featured prominently in videos at the start of the invasion. They showed a number of successful attacks against Russian tanks and armoured vehicles. They have since became less effective after Russia set up air defences in the battlefield. Turkey began selling the TB2 drones to Ukraine in 2019. Turkish officials have refused to disclose how many, but independent estimates reckon Ukraine has up to 50 TB2s. Aaron Stein, director of research at the US Foreign Policy Research Institute, described them as the “Toyota Corolla of drones”. He said: “It doesn’t do everything that your high-end sports car does, but it does 80% of that. So even for a high-end military, like the US the basic concept of using in an attritable, cheap platform to strike a superior force has inherent value.” Biden’s “unprecedented assistance” includes 100 drones, which officials have said are the Switchblade or “kamikaze drone” that explode on impact. Each drone is folded into a lightweight mortar launcher. Once it is fired the drone’s wings open out as the weapon is guided to its target. The most powerful version travels at 115mph and has a range of 50 miles. A lighter version has a range of six miles. The latest US package includes 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems in addition to more than 600 already promised. The FIM-92 Stinger is a “man-portable air-defence system” – or Manpads – that is typically used by ground troops but can also be used from helicopters. This type of weapon was seen as crucial to the mujahideen’s successful guerrilla conflict in the Soviet-Afghan war in the 1980s. Germany has also pledged to send 500 Stinger missiles. The Javelin is an anti-tank missile system that uses thermal imaging to find its target. The latest US package includes 2,000 of these surface-to-air missiles. They can be fired from a shoulder launcher or from the ground. The White House says it is sending 6,000 AT4 portable anti-tank weapons as part of the package outlined by Biden. The Swedish-made 84mm-calibre weapon has a range of 500 metres. It requires little training to use, but is single-shot so it has be discarded after it is fired. Thousands more anti-tank weapons are being supplied by European countries. These include Germany, which has pledged 1,000 anti-tank weapons from its inventory; Norway with 2,000; and Sweden, which has promised 5,000. The UK has sent 3,615 of these British-Swedish-made short-range next generation light anti-tank weapons – or NLAW missiles. Hundreds more are also expected to be sent at a cost of £120m. The missiles weigh only 12.5kg and are just over 1 metre long, making them easy for infantry to use. They have a maximum range of just 800 metres. The US has also pledged 1,000 light anti-armour weapons. The UK’s defence minister, Ben Wallace, has also promised to supply an unspecified number of high-velocity Starstreak anti-aircraft weapons to Ukraine. The Belfast-made weapons are known to be the fastest short-range surface-to-air missile. They accelerate after launch and include three laser-guided submunitions to increase the chance of hitting their targets. Poland proposed to allow all of its MiG-29 fighter jets, of a kind familiar to Ukraine’s pilots, to be transferred via a US airbase in Germany. The plan was blocked by the US, but the US has sent other Soviet-era aircraft to Ukraine in the form of five Mi-17 helicopters.",News/World news,What weapons have other countries supplied to Ukraine?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/what-weapons-have-other-countries-supplied-to-ukraine
3/18/2022,"Late-night hosts all recapped Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s appearance before the US Congress on Wednesday, in which the Ukrainian president, via video, appealed for more support against the Russian invasion and received a standing ovation. “I can say with absolute certainty that’s the warmest reception anyone has ever received on Zoom,” Seth Meyers said on Late Night. In response to Zelenskiy’s address, Joe Biden announced another $800m in aid to Ukraine. “The consequences for Russia have been intense, and there’s likely more coming,” Meyers explained. “On top of that, it seems like Putin did not expect that his barbaric invasion of Ukraine would go this badly or take this long.” According to some reports, Putin thought Russia’s military could capture Kyiv in two days, but the invasion has now been under way for three weeks. “Which explains the new law he passed that changes the entire month of March to one day,” Meyers quipped. Meyers also cheered the protest of Marina Ovsyannikova, a producer and editor for Russian state television, who burst on to a nightly news broadcast with a sign protesting the war in Ukraine. The sign read, in part: “Don’t believe the propaganda. They’re lying to you here.” “That is an incredibly brave protest knowing the likely consequences,” said Meyers. “In fact, it’s hard to fully grasp just how brave that is, because we take free speech for granted here.” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert also praised Zelenskiy’s address to Congress, which received bipartisan cheers. “You know it was a powerful speech when that many old people jump to their feet,” he said. “There were knees in that room that were alive during the Roosevelt administration.” Biden’s planned $800m in new military aid to Ukraine was “remarkable – not only because of how fast he moved to get them what they needed, but at no point did he use the phrase, ‘I would like you to do us a favor, though,’” Colbert joked, referring to Donald Trump’s infamous 2019 phone call with Zelenskiy that led to his first impeachment trial. Colbert also mocked the 190 Papa John’s pizza locations that will remain open in Russia, even as other companies – McDonald’s, KFC, Starbucks – shut down business in the country. These shops are primarily owned by Russians through a franchise agreement with a company controlled by an American, Christopher Wynne, who explained his reasoning as: “The vast majority of Russian people are very clearheaded and understand the dark gravity of the situation they’re in … and, at the end of the day, they appreciate a good pizza.” “Adding: unfortunately, we serve Papa Johns,” Colbert joked. Zelenskiy, in waxing fondly on America to US lawmakers, “knows way more about America than most US senators know about this country,” Trevor Noah observed on the Daily Show. “Like could you imagine how they would sound if they had to give an inspiring speech using Ukrainian history? “I’m also impressed that Zelenskiy was able to dodge so many landmines in his research,” he added. “Because you realize, this could’ve gone very wrong – ‘And now to 9/11, which as we all know from YouTube, was inside job. I see you, Bush.’ “For real, it was a really impressive speech,” Noah continued. Especially the ending, when Zelenskiy switched to English and addressed Biden directly: “You are the leader of the nation. I wish you be the leader of the world. Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace.” “I’m pretty sure that was the first time in history people applauded a Zoom call,” Noah joked. “It’s also impressive that Zelenskiy was able to deliver that message in his non-native tongue. In fact, when you think about it, his English is better than the past two US presidents.” “I think he’d rather get fighter jets, but the standing ovations were good,” said Jimmy Kimmel of Zelenskiy’s speech. “It was bipartisan – Republicans and Democrats stood for him, which is almost impossible. It’s like getting Kim and Kanye to agree on a daycare situation. It’s very difficult.” Zelenskiy appealed to Congress for help, “and Congress was like, ‘Listen, we’d love to help, but we just made daylight savings time permanent and we are wiped out,’” Kimmel joked. Biden remains reluctant to institute a no-fly zone over Ukraine, which could escalate into a direct conflict with Russia, a nuclear superpower. “But we are willing to wear blue and yellow lapel pins at all the award shows this month,” Kimmel noted. “So that’s something, right?” One of the “few bright spots” in the horrific Ukraine invasion, Kimmel continued, has been watching Russian oligarchs’ superyachts get seized by other governments; one Russian-owned yacht is stranded in Norway because locals refuse to refuel it. “Every once and awhile the Norwegians like to remind us they descended from Vikings, you know?” said Kimmel.",Arts/Culture,Seth Meyers on Zelenskiy’s speech: ‘Warmest reception anyone has ever received on Zoom’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/17/seth-meyers-volodymyr-zelenskiy-congress-late-night-recap
3/18/2022,"On Sunday morning, Jane Campion was riding high in the saddle. Her homoerotic western, The Power of the Dog, had been cleaning up at awards ceremonies before the Oscars at the end of the month, where it is nominated in 12 categories, including best picture and best director. Of course, there have been dissenters. More than usual, perhaps: the film is a Netflix production and therefore likely to infuriate the sorts of audiences who would never have ventured out to a cinema to see it, but may have found it among their recommendations because they once watched Adam Sandler’s The Ridiculous 6. Was Sam Elliott one of them? The actor, who has starred in westerns such as Tombstone and The Quick and the Dead, recently dismissed Campion’s film as “a piece of shit” before casting aspersions on its authenticity: “What the fuck does this woman from down there … know about the American west, and why the fuck did she shoot this movie in New Zealand and call it Montana?” Questioned about Elliott’s outburst at the Directors Guild of America awards on Saturday night, Campion coolly pointed out the sexist nature of his remarks, called him “a little bit of a B-I-T-C-H” and, most deliciously of all, reminded the world that “he’s not a cowboy, he’s an actor”. That is the sort of shade that Elliott could recline in for days, or however long it takes for Campion’s burn to stop stinging. Had the director maintained a dignified silence, the headline from the DGA awards would have been: “The Power of the Dog wins again.” (Campion took home the prize for outstanding directorial achievement in feature film.) But this was far juicier. The spectacle of a tough guy trying to undermine a woman, only to be put firmly in his place by her on the very territory that he has spent a lifetime staking out as his own, was unimaginably satisfying. The Power of the Dog is the tale of a tormented macho cowboy fatally underestimating those he considers weak or inferior – a story now playing out for real on the red carpet and on social media. Just 24 hours later, Campion wasn’t sounding like a champion. “What an honour to be in the room with you,” she told Venus and Serena Williams, who were in attendance at the Critics Choice awards to represent King Richard, the film in which Will Smith plays their father. Collecting her prize for best director (one of four that the film won), Campion called them “marvels”, before pointing out that “you do not play against the guys, like I have to” – a reference to her fellow nominees, who were all men. Serena was shown applauding from the audience; pictures later showed Venus and Campion dancing together at the afterparty. If there were any hard feelings after the film-maker’s suggestion that two black women hadn’t had it as tough as her, they had been smoothed over before the evening was out. Social media, however, is a different ballgame. The objections were best summed up there by the producer Drew Dixon, whose allegations of rape and sexual assault against the hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons were the subject of the 2020 documentary On the Record. (Simmons has vehemently denied all the allegations made against him in the film.) Dixon took to Twitter to make her feelings clear: “The nerve of Jane Campion to suggest her journey is harder than that of two Black women who’ve overcome racism, sexism and classism in one of the whitest richest sports in the world to become CHAMPIONS again and again is why I have trust issues with white feminists.” The writer and podcaster Molly Lambert even tweeted a picture of Kirsten Dunst, who is Oscar-nominated for best supporting actress for The Power of the Dog, sitting next to Lars von Trier in 2011 at the Cannes press conference for their film Melancholia; his flippant comments expressing an affinity for Hitler were widely agreed to have dashed Dunst’s chances of an Oscar nomination for her remarkable performance in that film. Lambert’s caption was: “Kirsten Dunst watching Jane Campion blow the Oscar for her.” Others posted links to a 1996 essay by Reshela DuPuis, which argued that Campion’s Oscar-winning 1993 film The Piano “relies heavily on profoundly racist depictions of the indigenous Māori people of New Zealand, and on culturally coded, deeply racialized representations of their land”. There was also a reminder of the excoriating analysis of the film by the late bell hooks, who described its “docile happy darkies … who appear to have not a care in the world”. The implication was clear: Campion is no beginner when it comes to diminishing people of colour. Heroes can be dangerous things in art, almost as dubious as a consensus. The thought that anyone is incapable of exhibiting bias, even a feted feminist auteur, should be discouraged. Campion, for her part, issued an apology for the Williams comment: “I did not intend to devalue these two legendary Black women and world‑class athletes,” she said, describing their accomplishments as “titanic and inspiring”. Putting aside the complexities of the specific arguments surrounding Campion’s comments, her experience of reputational whiplash last weekend proves yet again that the road to the Oscars, like hell, is paved with good intentions. What may appear to be a red carpet is in fact a banana skin – and Campion isn’t the first to put a foot wrong. During the 2013-14 awards season, the director David O Russell was in contention for his crime caper American Hustle when he began bemoaning the schedule of one of his stars, Jennifer Lawrence, who was busy shooting the Hunger Games series. “I’ll tell you what it is about that girl,” Russell said. “Talk about 12 years of slavery – that’s what the franchise is.” An apology followed. “Clearly, I used a stupid analogy in a poor attempt at humour,” he said. “I realised it the minute I said it and I am truly sorry.” American Hustle had never been the favourite to take home the best picture prize that year, but Russell’s insensitivity seemed to make certain that he wouldn’t need to waste time writing an acceptance speech. (The winner that year was 12 Years a Slave.) It seems unlikely that Campion’s comments will be enough to unseat her as the favourite for the best director Oscar, although poorly chosen words really can cost a nominee the prize. It is widely accepted that Charlotte Rampling blew her chances of winning the best actress Oscar in 2016, for her performance in 45 Years, after she suggested that the #OscarsSoWhite furore was “racist to whites” and that “perhaps the black actors did not deserve to make the final list”. (She later apologised: “I simply meant to say that, in an ideal world, every performance will be given equal opportunities for consideration.”) Michael Caine, a two-time Oscar winner, wasn’t up for an award that year – he was last nominated in 2002 for The Quiet American – but that didn’t stop him playing the loud-mouthed Englishman, advising actors of colour to “be patient” when it comes to receiving Oscar nominations. Hollywood loves few things better than life lessons, though, and there is a valuable one to be extrapolated from Campion’s whirlwind weekend: talented people who have experienced prejudice sometimes make foolish comments that expose their biases. People of colour experience these micro-aggressions routinely – the writer Kimberly Drew tweeted on Monday: “We’ve all worked with or for a Jane Campion.” For everyone else, the question is whether to learn from the film-maker’s behaviour and accept that we might easily have been guilty of the same error – or to take the Sam Elliott option.",Arts/Film,Red carpets and banana skins: Jane Campion and the Oscars hopefuls who jeopardised their chances,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/17/red-carpets-and-banana-skins-jane-campion-and-the-oscars-hopefuls-who-scuppered-their-chances
3/18/2022,"Conductors don’t normally receive a standing ovation before they have even reached the podium, but these are not normal times. Ukrainian-born Kirill Karabits was making his first appearance with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra since Russia invaded his homeland, and the Poole audience, many of them brandishing sunflowers, the national flower of Ukraine, gave him the warmest possible welcome. As he explained in a brief speech, Karabits had considered changing his programme to include a work by a Ukrainian composer, but reckoned that, over the 13 years that he has been the orchestra’s chief, the BSO had probably performed more Ukrainian music than any other orchestra outside the country itself, and so he had decided to leave things as planned. In fact the concert ended with a work whose finale has often been regarded as a symbol of resistance to Russian rule, Sibelius’s Second Symphony. Like all the really convincing Sibelius conductors, Karabits did not impose himself obviously on the music, never pushing too hard or micro-managing the phrases, yet his performance still had real cumulative power, and the various strands of the belligerent finale were drawn together with unanswerable conviction. Before the interval he had conducted Tintagel, the best known of the three symphonic poems that Arnold Bax composed during the first world war. Bax and Sibelius were good friends – Bax devoted his Fifth Symphony to the Finn – but in Tintagel at least it’s Debussy, his orchestral Images in particular, that is the more obvious model, and Karabits and his orchestra revelled in its intricate play of sonorities. They had begun with All These Lighted Things, which the American Elizabeth Ogonek composed for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 2017 – three nicely shaped miniatures, vividly scored and each with the ghost of a dance form behind it, and all finally cut short by a shatteringly brief climax that ebbs away in shards of metallic percussion.

It will likely make the payments, but probably in roubles rather than dollars. Some of Russia’s debt contracts permit such an arrangement; the two bonds in question do not. Russia has a grace period of 30 days within which to make payments in the normal fashion. If it fails to do so, it is likely to be declared in default by its creditor. Sovereign defaults send shockwaves through the global financial system. They signal that a debtor at the very apex of the monetary system – a government – is either unwilling or unable to meet its obligations. Since, in a modern monetary system, government debt is generally treated as the ultimate safe asset, this is a shock that goes beyond the arena of high finance. Russian defaults have rocked the global financial system twice in modern history. In 1917, the Bolsheviks repudiated the debts of the Tsarist empire, souring relations with Russia’s former allies, most notably France, for decades to come. In 1998, in the financial crisis that defined Vladimir Putin’s rise to power, Russia defaulted on its domestic debt and some Soviet-era foreign debt. The repercussions were significant enough to bring about the meltdown of the LTCM hedge fund, the world’s biggest, in New York. The current impending default is nothing like either of those occasions. Only a few short months ago Russia was a top-rated sovereign debtor. It had only $38bn in foreign currency debt outstanding, of which only $20bn was owned by foreign investors – a tiny amount for a trillion-dollar economy. The payment that is due now, $117m, is a small fraction of what Russia continues to earn every day for its oil and gas exports. For gas alone, Russia was a fortnight ago earning more than $700m a day. Russia will pay in its local currency not because it is unable to find $117m, or because it has unilaterally decided that these debts are odious and should not be serviced. It is not paying its foreign creditors because it is locked in an asymmetrical proxy war with the west, a struggle in which the latter has chosen to weaponise the financial system. The defining moment came on Saturday 26 February, with the announcement of central bank sanctions. This sent the rouble plunging, and forced the closure of Russia’s financial markets. In the coming months, inflation in Russia will surge. To contain the price increases, interest rates have been savagely hiked. Russia will have a hard time getting hold of vital imports. Economists estimate that Russia’s economy could contract by 15% or more. All of this is terrible news for Russian households and businesses. But if Iran is anything to go by, it will not lead to a total collapse of the Russian economy. Since only the US, which consumes hardly any Russian oil, has so far imposed an embargo on Russian energy exports, Russia continues to earn hard currency. Having piled up its foreign exchange earnings, it has enough foreign exchange reserves to settle its entire foreign currency debt outright more than 12 times over. Russia’s problem is not financial but political. It cannot access its hundreds of billions in foreign exchange reserves because of European and American sanctions. For its part, it has barred foreign investors from selling their Russian investments. And when it makes the $117m payment in roubles, it is not obvious that its foreign creditors will be able to set up bank accounts in Russia into which to receive them. To treat this as a regular default is to engage in a charade: it is a tit-for-tat measure in a financial war. Given the sanctions we have imposed, it is frankly silly to expect anything less. The losers will be the west’s private investors in Russian bonds. Their interests – not just the oligarchs’ – were sacrificed the moment sanctions were announced. BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, has almost entirely written off the $18.2bn in Russian assets it had at the beginning of the year. Practically every major western brand name is pulling out of Russia. Some will incur heavy losses in the process, inflicting pain both on their investors and on the hundreds of thousands of Russians who work with them. Ethics aside, it makes perfect sense from a business point of view. No one wants the reputational damage. Foreign creditors of the Russian government are in a different position. Their interest was not in selling hamburgers or self-assembly furniture to ordinary Russians. They put their money directly towards funding the Russian state, warts and all. The prospectuses of Russia’s bonds issued since the annexation of Crimea in 2014 specifically refer to geopolitical tensions with the west and the risk of sanctions. Knowing full well what they were funding, western investors snapped them up. That bet has now gone bad. The legal claims by Russia’s creditors may be odious but they are also powerful. If they are shameless enough to pursue their defaulted loans through the courts in London or New York, they may well be granted liens on Russian government property while the true victims of Putin’s aggression, first and foremost the Ukrainians, have no such recourse. Debt activists around the world have pushed for legislation in major creditor countries to ban vulture funds from taking advantage of distressed sovereigns. It is time for legislation in the UK and US to ensure that if anyone is able to make financial claims against Putin’s regime, it is not those who sought to profit by investing in it.
