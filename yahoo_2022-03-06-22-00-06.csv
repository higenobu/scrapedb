3/6/2022,"The public's fascination with the Titanic spans generations â€” and there's no question as to why. The $7.5 million (over $200 million today) luxury ocean liner was a representation of grandeur and, for many, was a beacon of hope. Construction began on March 3, 1909 and, when it was completed, it was the largest ship its kind (roughly three football fields long and as tall as a 17-story building!). On April 10, 1912, the Titanic set sail on its maiden voyage from Southhampton, England to New York City. But a few days into the trip, the ship hit an iceberg and sank within hours. Approximately 1,500 people died in the tragedy. Today, it lies at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, but there's still photographic evidence of the impressive vessel. Get a closer look at one of the most beautiful ships to ever exist with these rare photos.

3/6/2022,"Donald Trump asked why the Truth Social app is not dominating the competition, reported the Daily Beast. The app's February rollout was plagued by technical difficulties, and it is currently trailing its competitors. Sources said the former president has been heard swearing and complaining about the app's lack of success. Former President Donald Trump is furious about the underwhelming launch of his new social media app Truth Social, The Daily Beast reported, citing two sources familiar with the matter. Sources told the outlet Trump had been heard on the phone ""swearing gratuitously"" and asking ""what the fuck is going on"" with the app. The former president's long-hyped app came out on February 20, but technical difficulties plagued its launch. Many people who downloaded the app say they could not create accounts or were placed on waitlists. The former president has been complaining about the negative press surrounding the app's botched rollout, sources told The Daily Beast, demanding to know why more people aren't using it and why it isn't dominating the competition. An analysis of the app's traffic suggests that Truth Social is doing worse or the same as its MAGA app competitors like Gab and Gettr, The Daily Beast said. While Truth Social had a sharp spike of around 2 million daily visits to the site when it first came out, the outlet said, citing data from traffic analysis site SimilarWeb, it then dipped to an average of approximately 300,000 visits each day. It puts the site on par with Gettr but far behind Gab, which averaged around 650,000 daily visits in the same period, the outlet said. It is despite Gab's mobile apps ban from Apple and Google's app stores. Truth Social's lack of traffic could be due to the app's long waitlist, which now has more than a million users, The Daily Beast said. It is also currently only available on the Apple app store, and there is no Android or web version. The former president is also apparently yet to post Truth Social, instead choosing to make TV and radio appearances to comment on current affairs, Axios noted. Insider cannot verify whether or not Trump has posted, as Truth Social is still restricting access to the app. The former president is both the founder and chairman of Truth Social, which he launched after Twitter and Facebook barred him following the January 6 Capitol riot.

3/6/2022,"McDonald's and PepsiCo, along with many others, are being urged to end their business in Russia. New York state's comptroller wrote to several companies calling for action, per Reuters. British politician John Mann has made similar requests. McDonald's and PepsiCo are among brands facing calls from political figures to cut business ties with Russia, following its invasion of Ukraine In a letter Friday, Thomas DiNapoli, New York state comptroller, urged companies to rethink their Russian business operations because they face ""significant and growing legal, compliance, operational, human rights and personnel, and reputational risks,"" Reuters reported. He added that suspending or ending business in Russia ""would address various investment risks associated with the Russian market"" and play a key role in ""condemning Russia's role in fundamentally undermining the international order."" McDonald's and PepsiCo did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment, made outside of normal working hours. Other companies, including Estee Lauder, Kimberly-Clark Corp, Coty Inc, Mondelez International Inc, Fortinet Inc, Bunge Ltd, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc, and Trimble Inc, were also asked in the letter to boycott business in Russia, per Reuters. Since Russian President Vladamir Putin invaded Ukraine in an unprovoked attack, scores of companies have taken action by ending or limiting their commercial dealings with Russia. Ikea, Spotify, and Nike were among the major companies that recently severed business ties with Russia. Some retail brands including Publix and Kroger also showed their solidarity with Ukraine by removing Russian vodka from store shelves. British politician John Mann called for similar action to DiNapoli. In a tweet, he said: ""If Mcdonalds and Starbucks continue to sell in Russia then an international boycott of their products should be instigated."" Social media users have also called for company boycotts, with McDonald's being a particular target. One user who posted a photo of open McDonald's stores in Russia said: ""Guess who is doing business as normal in #Russia no surprise #BoycottMcDonalds."" Another said: ""@McDonalds Leave #Russia or lose loyal customers, the choice is yours. #BoycottMcDonalds.""
