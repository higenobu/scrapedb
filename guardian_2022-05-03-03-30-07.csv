5/3/2022,"Johnny Depp’s $50m defamation case against his former wife, Amber Heard, entered its 12th day of testimony in a Virginia courtroom on Monday, a day after Heard was reported to have fired her PR team. Jurors were told that after Heard made allegations of domestic violence against Depp in 2016, his film work and earnings dropped dramatically. Depp’s agent, Jack Whigham, testified that in 2017 the actor made three studio and two independent films with fees of around $35m, but in 2018 made just two independent films for fees of $4m. Whigham said that for one of those films, Minamata, financing became “shaky” and Depp was forced to drop his fee “to save the movie”. Disney, which had scheduled Depp for a sixth installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, “were going in a different direction”, Whigham said. Depp, who was due to be paid $20m plus a share of profits, was to be replaced by Margot Robbie. “I was not successful in rescuing Pirates for Johnny,” Whigham said. “After the op-ed it was impossible to get him a studio film,” Whigham said, referring to the Washington Post article at the center of the defamation action, in which Heard said she was a survivor of domestic and sexual assault. “With respect to Johnny, it was catastrophic,” Whigham said. Under cross-examination, Whigham said the article became “a death knell, catastrophic thing for Mr Depp in the Hollywood community”. Depp had not made a movie, he said, since July 2020. The court was also presented with testimony from Travis McGivern, a member of Depp’s security team who often worked the night shift. The choreography of disputes at Depp and Heard’s five-penthouse complex in Los Angeles again became the subject of attention, as McGivern testified that he saw Heard punch Depp in the face after he and Depp’s nurse were called at 4am one day in April 2016. McGivern said Heard threw a Red Bull can at Depp from a second level, hitting him on the back. “She threw a bag or purse, she spat at him, a lot of verbal vitriol,” McGivern said. “Typically, it was Ms Heard directing her feelings at Mr Depp,” he added, as the frequency of arguments increased to “several times a week”. McGivern said Depp never responded physically. As the verbal insults continued, Depp “gave as good as he got”, he said. The abuse, he said, could include “anything and everything … the f-word is my favorite word but it was being thrown around to the point I was uncomfortable.” On the night in question, McGivern said, Heard left and returned with her sister, Whitney, while he was trying to get Depp out. By then, he said, Depp had thrown racks of Heard’s clothes and accessories off a third-floor balcony. McGivern said both Heard and Depp were “agitated”. Typically, he said, Depp would grab framed letters from Hunter S Thompson or Marlon Brando before going back to his house on North Sweetzer, which was once owned by Bela Lugosi. McGivern said he was standing between Depp and Heard when “in the corner of my eye, I saw a fist and an arm come across my right shoulder. I heard and saw a closed fist contact Mr Depp on the left side of his face”. McGivern testified it was Heard who threw the punch and that Depp had a look of “shock” on his face. The actor had a “nice little shiner”, he said, describing his face as red and swollen. Depp, McGivern said, had been angry at him for not shielding him. Depp’s lawyers will wind up their presentation on Tuesday. On Wednesday, it is believed Heard will take the stand in her defence against Depp’s $50m defamation claim, and counter with a $100m claim of her own, for nuisance. Heard was reported on Sunday to have fired her team at Precision Strategies. She has reportedly hired another firm, Shane Communications. One source told the New York Post of the switch while another said the Aquaman actor was “frustrated with her story not being told effectively”. “It’s a tough task to try and convince people that they shouldn’t pay attention to or listen to the things they have already seen and heard for themselves,” a crisis PR insider told Law & Crime. “And what they’ve seen and heard so far has brought a ton of organic support to Johnny’s side. People can decide for themselves, but three weeks to turn that all around is going to be tough.”  In the US, the domestic violence hotline is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

5/3/2022,"Europe is facing a crunch point in mid-May when EU member states will have to reject Moscow’s demands for fuel payments to be made in roubles – despite being without alternative gas supply, Brussels has warned. Kadri Simson, the European commissioner for energy, said on Monday that the Kremlin’s demands had to be rebuffed despite the risks of an interruption to supply at a time that the shortfall cannot be made good. Last week, Gazprom suspended its gas flow to Poland and Bulgaria and threatened the supply of others if they should follow Warsaw and Sofia in failing to pay for fuel in the Russian currency. After a meeting of EU energy ministers, Simson said that all the energy ministers had accepted that paying in roubles through the mechanism set out by Russia would breach sanctions imposed by the bloc after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. She added that she had not heard of any European energy company that was preparing to comply with Moscow despite suggestions to the contrary from Gazprom and firms such as MOL of Hungary. Simson said: “Many European energy companies are due to make the next payment to Gazprom in mid-May and are trying to understand better what they should do and we need to give them the clarity that paying in roubles through the conversion mechanism managed by the Russian public authorities and a second dedicated account at Gazprom bank is a violation of the sanctions and cannot be accepted.” In 2021, the EU imported 155bn cubic metres of natural gas from Russia, accounting for about 45% of EU gas imports and close to 40% of its total gas consumption. In the last year, this dependency has been reduced but the reliance on Russian fossil fuel remains so high that there is no alternative that could fully compensate for its loss. It is understood that the next major date for payments for gas by European energy companies is 20 May. The potential standoff comes as the EU considers phasing in a ban on Russian oil, a move that Germany’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, said on Monday would lead to a major economic hit and higher prices for consumers. Habeck said Germany was not opposed to such a ban but he warned that Europeans needed to be prepared for the consequences and that some countries would be hit harder than others. He said: “We will be harming ourselves, that much is clear. It’s inconceivable that sanctions won’t have consequences for our own economy and for prices in our countries. “We as Europeans are prepared to bear [the economic strain] in order to help Ukraine. But there’s no way this won’t come at a cost to us.” Under the draft sixth round of sanctions to be discussed by EU ambassadors on Wednesday, a ban on the import of Russian oil would be enacted by the end of the year, although Hungary has said it could block the proposal if alternatives are not successfully found. Anna Moskwa, Poland’s climate and environment minister, said Warsaw, which has been investing heavily in liquefied natural gas terminals, would be prepared to help any EU country that needed alternatives to Russian fossil fuels. She said: “We will call for immediate sanctions on Russian oil and gas. This is the next, and urgent, and absolute step. We already have coal. Now it’s time for oil, and [the] second step is for gas. The best option is take them all together.”",News/World news,EU comes to the crunch over Russia’s demands to pay roubles for gas,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/02/eu-to-reject-moscow-demands-to-pay-roubles-for-russian-gas

So happy to see all these people there. The people of Blackburn, they all seem like part of a community, but for me coming new to this city … now I’m feeling like a part of the community.” Blackburn Rovers play in the Championship, the second tier of English football. Khalifa is a Manchester City fan but said he would now also support his new home side. “I know that is the English way to do,” he said. “Every city [has] to support their team whatever their team are doing, good or bad. I’ll support them until they make it.” The Eid prayer is performed as part of Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of the Ramadan month of fasting, and Eid al-Adha, another Islamic festival that falls later in the year. On Eid al-Fitr, the prayer comes after a mandatory act of charity offered to the poor by every financially able Muslim, and is followed by a meal of sweet dishes. The prayer is typically performed as part of a congregation in a large open area such as a field or mosque, though in recent years events have been cancelled or scaled down because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Dozens of social media users congratulated Blackburn for hosting the event. “This is actually quite amazing,” said one. “Well done to all involved – pretty special for a little town called Blackburn. Hope other clubs follow where there’s a need.” Another said: “Proud to be a Rover. Eid Mubarak.” Eid prayers were held at sites around the country on Monday morning.

5/3/2022,"The House select committee investigating the US Capitol attack on Monday asked three Republican members of Congress to assist its inquiry, as it seeks to establish the extent of their roles in Donald Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election. The panel sent letters requesting voluntary cooperation to Mo Brooks, Andy Biggs and Ronny Jackson, three congressmen who strategised ways to stop certification of Joe Biden’s election win or appeared to have connections to elements involved in the Capitol attack. Bennie Thompson, the Democratic committee chair, told the Guardian last week the panel wanted to conduct interviews with Republicans so it could consider their testimony for its report, due to be published in September. The panel opted against issuing subpoenas compelling testimony in the first instance, since that could cause the Republicans to attack, whereas an informal interview might at least yield some information, two sources close to the matter said. In a statement, Jackson refused to cooperate. “I will not participate in the illegitimate committee’s ruthless crusade against President Trump and his allies,” he said, hours after a Trump-appointed judge ruled in separate January 6 litigation that the panel was, in fact, legitimate. House investigators are expected to issue further letters to Republican members of Congress, sources said. The Guardian first reported the committee was considering letters to Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert and Paul Gosar, in addition to Biggs and Brooks. The panel made a particularly expansive request to Biggs, the former head of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, outlining four lines of inquiry that investigators want to pursue with respect to his role in the weeks before 6 January. Thompson told Biggs the committee wanted to ask him about a crucial 21 December meeting at the White House between Trump and dozens of Republicans, which produced a plan to have the then vice-president, Mike Pence, refuse to certify Biden’s win. The letter also said the panel wanted to ask what Biggs knew of plans to stage a march from the Ellipse, near the White House, to the Capitol on 6 January, through his purported contacts with the pro-Trump activist Ali Alexander, who led the “Stop the Steal” movement after the 2020 election. Biggs’s potential contacts with Alexander are of special interest to the investigation, the sources said. The committee is trying to untangle claims by Alexander that he “schemed up putting maximum pressure on Congress while they were voting” with Brooks, Biggs and Gosar, and his testimony that he spoke to Biggs’s staff and the congressman himself. Alexander obtained a permit for a 6 January rally near the Capitol. But the rally never took place – although a separately organised event did – and Alexander was instead filmed going up the Capitol steps with members of the Oath Keepers militia group. Thompson said the panel also wanted to ask Biggs about his efforts to pressure legislators to create “alternate” slates of electors for Trump in states he lost, as well as an alleged request he made to Trump for a pardon in the days after the Capitol attack. In a letter to Brooks, the select committee said it wanted to ask him about his recent public comments, how Trump supposedly asked him on several occasions to “help rescind the election” and that “we’ve got to take Joe Biden down and put me in now”. In the letter to Jackson, the panel indicated they would ask Trump’s former White House physician about why his name came up in encrypted text messages among members of the Oath Keepers as the Capitol attack was under way. According to text messages in a recent court filing, an unidentified Oath Keeper messaged a group chat in the afternoon of 6 January that “Ronnie [sic] Jackson (TX) office inside Capitol – he needs OK help. Anyone inside?” The same Oath Keeper provided an update less than 10 minutes later: “Dr Ronnie Jackson – on the move. Needs protection. If anyone inside cover him. He has critical data to protect.” The Oath Keepers leader, Stewart Rhodes, responded: “Give him my cell.” The extraordinary exchange raises the notion that members of the Oath Keepers – two of whom are among those who have been indicted on charges of seditious conspiracy for storming the Capitol – were close enough to Jackson to know his whereabouts and condition in real time. To that extent, the letter to Jackson said, the select committee wants to ask him about whether he had contacts with the Oath Keepers, how the militia group could have known that he needed protection or, in another text, knew he had “critical data to protect”.",News/US news,Capitol attack committee requests cooperation from key Republican trio,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/02/capitol-attack-republicans-mo-brooks-andy-biggs-ronny-jackson
5/3/2022,"The Conservative MP for Tiverton and Honiton, Neil Parish, announced he would quit as an MP after admitting to twice watching pornography in the House of Commons, triggering another byelection. It comes days after the resignation of Imran Ahmad Khan, Tory MP for Wakefield, who was found guilty of sexual assault. While Parish’s seat at least may seem safe for the Tories, recent byelections have brought shock results. Here’s a rundown of the two votes to come – and the eight already held since the last general election. The Conservatives have held the Devon seat since its creation in 1997 but are expected to face a fight to cling on to it after Parish’s resignation. While Labour finished second in 2019, the Liberal Democrats are bullish about their chances. Amid talk of an informal plan for neither party to over-exert itself where the other is better-placed to unseat a Tory incumbent, the Lib Dems believe they could end up being the principal challenger. No date has yet been set for the byelection. One of the seats the Conservatives were most proud to grab during their raid of the so-called red wall in 2019, they now fear losing it before the parliamentary term is up. Imran Ahmad Khan resigned after being convicted of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy in April, then being confronted by the Guardian with more allegations. The byelection is expected in June. Among the greatest upsets of recent byelections, and one of the most closely associated with Boris Johnson’s personal failings in No 10. The Lib Dem candidate Helen Morgan pulled off a 34% swing in a supposedly safe Tory seat in December after the prime minister’s disastrous attempt to prevent Owen Paterson facing the consequences of an “egregious” breach of lobbying rules ended with the former minister’s resignation. Paterson had won a near-23,000 majority in 2019. Morgan emerged triumphant with her own 6,000 majority. Another Lib Dem gain from the Conservatives in what had been one of their safest seats – this time in the Buckinghamshire constituency. Sarah Green built up a majority of more than 8,000 votes as she managed a swing of 25 percentage points to win last June – foreshadowing the Lib Dems’ win in Shropshire six months later. The contest was called after the death from cancer of the local MP Cheryl Gillan, who had represented the constituency since 1992 and held it in 2019 with a majority of 16,223. The Conservatives are not the only party to have seen a seat they may have hoped to hold slip away during this parliament. A year ago, the people of Hartlepool woke up in a Tory constituency for the first time in more than 50 years after Jill Mortimer won. While distrust of Johnson has been identified as one of the issues behind Tory troubles, Labour figures said the prime minister’s popularity made their task an uphill one in this north-east England byelection, which was precipitated by the resignation of Mike Hill amid misconduct allegations. An employment tribunal later ruled he sexually assaulted and harassed a parliamentary staff member. Labour may have gained ground after the resignation of Neil Gray to stand in a Scottish parliamentary election in the overlapping Holyrood constituency, but Anum Qaisar-Javed ultimately held the Westminster seat for the SNP last May. In so doing, the modern studies teacher became only Scotland’s second female Muslim MP. She told BBC Scotland she hoped to be a role model for others from diverse backgrounds, and she pledged to fight for Scottish independence. In Shropshire last December, the Conservatives paid the price of what Johnson admitted was his “total mistake” in trying to replace the system that found Paterson breached the rules with one dominated by his own party. But they had escaped such censure in the south-east London suburb of Old Bexley and Sidcup two weeks earlier. Louie French held the safe seat in a byelection triggered by the death from lung cancer of the former cabinet minister James Brokenshire – albeit with a reduced majority on a smaller turnout. Kim Leadbeater, sister of the murdered MP Jo Cox, held the seat for Labour after her party colleague Tracy Brabin stood down when she was elected West Yorkshire’s mayor. Anger at the revelation that the former health secretary, Matt Hancock, had breached his own government’s social distancing rules, as well as a concerted effort to keep George Galloway out of power after he was blamed for stoking division, were identified as key drivers of the Labour vote. The election of Paulette Hamilton to the West Midlands seat in March this year followed the sudden death of the former shadow minister Jack Dromey, who had held the seat since 2010. Hamilton, a former nurse who became Birmingham’s first black MP, increased Labour’s vote share on 2019. She said the result showed that “with listening to what the public are telling us and acting upon that”, Labour could secure more success. Anna Firth held the Essex constituency for the Conservatives in February in a byelection that followed the murder of the MP David Amess by an Islamist terrorist. She won with 86% of the vote after Labour, the Liberal Democrats and other mainstream political parties chose not to contest the seat. Speaking after her victory speech, she praised Amess’ widow, adding that she recognised it was a “sad and painful day” for his family.",News/Politics,Byelections: will recent scandals at Westminster cause upsets at the polls?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/02/byelections-will-recent-scandals-at-westminster-cause-upsets-at-the-polls
5/3/2022,"Uefa has told Russia that the country’s bid to host the men’s European Championship has been rejected and that their team will be replaced by Portugal in the women’s tournament this summer, as it took further measures in response to the war in Ukraine. The European governing body said it was acting to ensure its tournaments had “smooth staging in a safe and secure environment for all”, and confirmed that there would be no Russian sides competing in next season’s European club competitions either. Russia had made a shock, and many felt provocative, move in March when it expressed an interest in hosting the men’s European Championship in 2028 or 2032, despite being banned from international football at the moment of application. Responding to the move on Monday, Uefa said it had rejected the submission as “not eligible”, citing article 16.02 of its regulations which states that “each bidder shall ensure that it does not act in a manner that could bring Uefa … or European football into disrepute.” With the women’s Euros due to start on 6 July, Uefa confirmed that Portugal would take part in the tournament to be held in England, claiming the place vacated by Russia, who beat them in a qualifying playoff. Russia will not be able to qualify for next year’s women’s World Cup, having been removed by Uefa from qualifying group E and their results rendered null and void. In what amounted to a barrage of injunctions against Russia and its football authorities, which took in everything from participation in the Futsal Champions League to the amateur Regions’ Cup, Uefa also took action against its club sides. No Russian team will take part in European competition next season and the country’s coefficient has been reduced to a level consistent with the lowest total reached over the past five seasons. One immediate consequence is that the champions of this season’s Scottish Premiership will gain automatic qualification to the group stages of next season’s Champions League. As a coda to the organisation’s various decrees, a spokesperson said that Uefa would “remain on standby to convene further meetings to reassess the legal and factual situation as it evolves and adopt further decisions as necessary”.",Sport/Football,Russia thrown out of Women’s Euros and banned from Uefa tournament bids,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/02/russia-thrown-out-of-womens-euros-and-banned-from-uefa-tournament-bids
5/3/2022,"Unions have begun pushing the Queensland government for wage increases across the public service that meet inflation – which is running at a 20-year high – with key agreements set to expire this year. The current work agreements for teachers, nurses, police officers and transport workers are all set to end in the coming months. This comes as annual inflation reaches 5.1%, with the cost of living rapidly outpacing the state government’s official wages policy that has had salary increases capped at 2.5%. The president of the Queensland Teacher’s Union, Cresta Richardson, said the union and the Department of Education would be using a “an interest-based bargaining approach” across eight areas, including salaries. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Richardson said the union’s aim was to achieve salaries and conditions “that acknowledge and reward the work of school leaders and teachers” and addresses the “unprecedented times we live in, in terms of inflation”. Sally McManus, the secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, told Guardian Australia she would support a wage increase for public sector workers to keep up with the rising rate of inflation. “Wages … have been flatlining before they went backwards for 10 years. Last year, the average worker lost $800. This year, we’re on track to lose $1,000,” McManus said. “People don’t want to see their wages go backwards. People want to make sure they can get pay rises that deal with the inflation that we’ve got.” McManus also said wage caps should be scrapped and replaced with fair bargaining. “Having wage increases in both productivity and CPI is what’s really important in some sectors … like aged care,” McManus said. “Those jobs have been undervalued, and so they need to be reevaluated to reflect the skills and the importance of the work.” Dr Richard Denniss, the chief economist at the Australia Institute, said wages should be increased beyond the rate of inflation. “The Reserve Bank governor has made it clear that we need to have real wage growth, that is, wage growth over and above inflation,” Denniss said. “Wage growth is good for small business, big business and it help public servants keep up with the rapidly rising inflation cycle.” In 2020, the Queensland government froze wages for public servants who were due for a pay rise in the next financial year to “maximise the protection of public sector employment.” A report the same year by the Australia Institute’s Centre for Future Work revealed freezing public sector wages would cost the Queensland economy $9bn over three years. The Centre for Future Work report, by the economist Dan Nahum, warned of the “deeply damaging” results from any austerity measures targeting government workers. “We will need more public services, more government income supports, and more decent public sector jobs as Australia strives to recover from this unprecedented crisis,” Nahum said at the time. “The idea of pulling money out of an economy at a time like this, and pulling services out at a time like this, is a really alarming idea.” The report also noted that two in three public sector jobs in Queensland are based outside Brisbane, and that regional areas would be more affected by an austerity policy towards the public sector. Dr Denniss said Nahum’s arguments still stand. He said every additional dollar spent by the state government on higher wages would go into the pockets of people who spend that money in their local communities. “Australia has record high profits as a share of GDP and the owners of companies are doing better than they’ve ever done,” he said. “To suggest that now is not the time to increase wages because it might lead to some reduction in profits is absurd. “While some businesses are adamant that if their wages went up they might lay off some workers, all businesses benefit when their customers get a pay rise.”",News/Australia news,Unions eye pay rises that reflect inflation as Queensland public sector agreements expire,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/03/unions-eye-pay-rises-that-reflect-inflation-as-queensland-public-sector-agreements-expire
5/3/2022,"With the cost of houses in Australia soaring in recent years, including up almost 25% last year, both major parties have policies designed at helping people into the property market. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, used his campaign launch in Perth on Sunday to unveil the party’s new “Help to Buy” scheme, while the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has been talking up the Coalition’s existing “Home Guarantee” scheme which it launched in 2020. So how do the two schemes compare? Both policies are aimed at helping people into the property market, but have different rules and conditions. The biggest difference is that the Labor scheme is a “shared equity” program, which means the government basically owns a certain portion of your house by contributing a large chunk of the purchase price. This would be up to 40% of a new home, and 30% of an existing home. For example, on a $600,000 house that has a government equity share of 30%, you would have to get a loan approved for $420,000, while the government would chip in $180,000, substantially expanding a buyer’s purchasing power. When the house is sold, the government is entitled to its 30% share back, meaning it would get shared benefit of any capital gains from price rises. Likewise, it shares the risk of any fall in house prices. The Coalition’s Home Guarantee scheme provides a government guarantee for a portion of the loan for someone with a lower deposit, allowing them to borrow more than they otherwise would be allowed to. Under this program, the government does not own a part of your home or directly contribute to the cost of a new property. The Coalition’s scheme requires a deposit of 5% for first-home buyers, whereas Labor’s Help to Buy scheme only requires a 2% deposit. Both schemes will allow people to borrow money without the need to pay mortgage lender insurance, providing a significant saving for homebuyers. The Home Guarantee scheme has 50,000 places annually, including 35,000 for first-home buyers, 5,000 for single parents and 10,000 for regional buyers. It is open to anyone in these categories who earns up to $125,000 for a single person or $200,000 for a couple. Labor’s policy is open to anyone who doesn’t currently own a property, and will have 10,000 places annually. The income caps for the Help to Buy scheme are up to $90,000 for a single and $120,000 for a couple. The Grattan Institute’s economic policy program director, Brendan Coates, said that while the Coalition scheme was focused on first-home buyers, Labor’s scheme would also benefit older Australians. An example would be someone who had lost their home after a divorce, and was struggling to get back into the housing market. The Grattan Institute has highlighted the risk of the Help to Buy scheme only having a small 2% deposit requirement, preferring a 5% deposit to provide a buffer for the possibility of falling house prices and the risk of negative equity. However, the smaller loan being granted under Labor’s scheme means that the purchaser would have lower loan repayments on a smaller mortgage than they would if they took out a loan under the Coalition’s Home Guarantee scheme. Under the government’s scheme, the buyer pays the mortgage on the full value of the home. Coates said that both policies are aimed at accessibility, rather than affordability, and neither was a “panacea” for housing affordability. He says there are several things that would improve housing affordability, naming housing supply and land use planning which are primarily the responsibility of state governments as two key areas of reform. The commonwealth could offer incentives for states to boost housing supply which in turn would help affordability. “Paying the states to boost housing construction, set housing targets and if they exceed them, offering incentive payments, would be a good way forward,” Coates said. He said there were “diminished ambitions” on both sides of politics for changing capital gains tax or negative gearing tax concessions, which were also key to addressing housing affordability. “There’s lots of things that are politically unpopular that we think would work, and even if we did all of those things like fixing supply and phasing back the tax breaks, house prices might fall at best 20% to 25%,” he said. “You’re still going see house prices high relative to incomes compared to where they have been historically, so the deposit hurdle is still a problem for young people and serviceability is still a problem for all people. “So that’s why we think this [shared equity policy] is needed. It’s a piece of the puzzle, but it doesn’t solve the biggest problems in the housing market.” Coates said both policies would have a very small impact on house prices, with the government’s scheme possibly having a slightly bigger inflationary effect. He said Labor’s shared equity proposal would add $5bn in stock value to a housing market that is worth more than $9tn. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Any time you add in to the demand of housing, there’s the risk that you’re going to push up prices,” he said. “Now, the size of the scheme and the house price thresholds mean it’s going to be pretty small. The deposit guarantee scheme, because it is so much larger will probably have more of an effect, because we are talking about potentially up to one in three first-time buyers in the country in any given year could access that scheme. “But they’re relatively small price impacts compared to things like interest rates.”",News/Australia news,What are the differences between the major parties’ homebuying policies this election?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/03/what-are-the-differences-between-the-major-parties-homebuying-policies-this-election
5/3/2022,"I’ve spent more than half my life in or near the central Victorian electorate of Nicholls. I’m the product of a large extended farming family and I’ve worked in agriculture all my life. My left-leaning mates think I’m a conservative, my conservative mates think I’m a lefty. The truth is I’m neither. The major parties lost me over a decade ago when they abandoned policy and humanity for political expediency. They sacrificed people seeking asylum for votes and ruined thousands of lives. They ignored the climate crisis to keep the miners happy and ruined more lives affected by bushfire, drought and flood. Democratic governments aren’t supposed to ruin lives. At 54 years old, this election is personal. For once in my life, my vote will count. Nicholls is Victoria’s food bowl, growing and processing fruit, tomatoes and milk as well as cropping, sheep and beef cattle. The northern part of the electorate is part of the largest irrigation scheme in the country, the Goulburn Murray Irrigation District, which I would argue did the heaviest lifting in returning water from private ownership to the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder. Farmers now operate with half the irrigation water and 70% of the irrigated land area, compared with 1997. The most southern part of the Murray Darling Basin is a long way from the rivers of Queensland and New South Wales. Much smaller hats and smaller farms and far less connection with federal political powerbrokers. You need a thick skin, a smart brain and good supply of irrigation water to navigate northern Victorian irrigated farming. In the millennium drought, many farmers sold their water, a considerable asset, back to the government. Those who kept their water, use the valuable asset for themselves or place it on the “allocation market”. It’s like an Airbnb for irrigation water in that you rent your water. Prices go up when demand is high or when supply is scarce. During the peak drought of 2019, the allocation market price was 10 times the current price. Think of paying $3,000 a night for a room in Sydney instead of $300, in a place that you once owned. For the irrigators of the Nicholls, the next water crisis and the next deep moment of trauma is only as far away as the next drought. Climate change means more droughts more often. The deadline for implementing the Murray Darling Basin Plan is June 2024. Each state is under pressure to meet its commitment for water handed back to the environment. Most people around here feel further irrigation water buybacks will break people, businesses and towns in Nicholls. It must be avoided. The next member for Nicholls will be responsible for influencing the federal water minister and the prime minister so the region is heard and a fair outcome is negotiated. Win the election and win that responsibility. Yet federal parliamentary leaders continue to demonstrate they don’t take us or their responsibility seriously. Barnaby Joyce’s behaviour at the opening of Dhungala, the Echuca Moama bridge is a case in point. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter That bridge opening was probably the biggest thing to happen in Echuca since Charles and Diana visited in the 1980s. It was a huge occasion for residents on both sides of the Murray. It was also a time to pay tribute to the 60 years of delegations to Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne to lobby governments. That’s three generations of locals lobbying. Instead of paying tribute, Joyce grabbed the press conference with gusto only to remind wavering Nationals voters why they might look at other options. The locals are livid. “Poor form”, said one. “Why didn’t they throw him in?” was another. “Frustrating but hardly surprising,” said yet another. The main contenders for Nicholls are National Party Sam Birrell, Liberal Steve Brooks and Independent Rob Priestly. These three white men are locally raised with strong credentials in business and agriculture.

5/3/2022,"The Australian Election Commission is recording a spike in postal vote applications so far during the campaign, a trend which could delay results in closely fought seats. Real-time data shows the AEC has received 1.54m postal vote applications already in the election campaign. It received about 1.5m in the entire 2019 election campaign. Here is what the postal vote applications per day are looking like for the 2022 election compared to recent past elections. Looks like we're in for pretty huge postal vote numbers if all of these people postal vote. pic.twitter.com/7PLOMaMnXe Analysis by Damon Muller, an elections expert with the parliamentary library, suggests the trend cannot entirely be explained by increases to the population since 2019. The number of postal vote applications as a proportion of enrolled voters is also higher than past elections, though not as significantly. Here is the same chart as a proportion of enrolments for that election. It's not just that there are more people voting this election, more of them are applying for postal votes (but the difference is not as dramatic). pic.twitter.com/UVMrfmzW73 The AEC media director, Evan Ekin-Smyth, said comparisons between different elections had been complicated by the way the major parties were collecting and submitting data about postal votes sent in through their various platforms, which was making the analysis of data in real-time difficult. But he said the AEC’s data did clearly show an increase in postal voting applications during the 2022 campaign, compared with the three prior elections. Ekin-Smyth said the AEC was initially surprised at the scale of the increase. “The general gist of it is – it’s more,” he said. “But if the curve for how many people are applying for postal votes flattens out, like it usually does through an election period, it’s not that much more. Early on, it was tracking double, so early on it was opening our eyes a bit. “Our eyes have closed a little bit more. We got about 1.5m postal vote applications last election. If the curve does flatten like we think, maybe that will end up at something like 1.7m to 1.8m this election, which is not a remarkable increase.” Postal votes have remained relatively static in recent elections, hovering at about 8% of total votes, the AEC said. Ekin-Smyth said Covid and the way political parties are distributing postal voting forms to Australians this campaign could explain the change. “You’d have to think Covid plays a part in that, but the real spamming of party postal vote applications that’s occurred this election – which occurs every election, but it was a little bit different this election – could have contributed,” he said. “They sort of evolved their tactics by using websites and text messages and emails, rather than just putting them in letterboxes, and given that some elections have been wholly postal in Covid times, there could have been people receiving these things and thinking ‘well it’s a wholly postal election’ and doing it for those reasons, or thinking it was the preferred method.” The AEC has already expressed concern at the way the parties are distributing information about postal voting, warning it is “potentially misleading”. Parties this election are sending out forms to voters where they can register with the AEC to vote by mail. But the forms are sent back via the political parties, raising concerns about privacy and data harvesting. The AEC wrote to parties warning them over reports of incorrect forms being distributed to voters in one division and the AEC’s official purple colouring being used on other forms. “While we haven’t seen unauthorised postal vote applications, the use of colour and wording means someone who doesn’t examine the material in detail could mistake it for a piece of AEC communication,” the AEC said. Labor have set up howtovote.org.au and the Liberals have established postal.vote to target voters. Neither site has significant party branding. Political parties are also exempt from privacy law, meaning there is no visibility or certainty on how they are using the data collected from postal votes submitted through their platforms. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “People have a right to know who they are handing their data over,” Ekin-Smyth said. “If they think it’s the AEC, well we operate under the privacy act, and the parties don’t.” Any additional postal voting puts more pressure on the count and has the potential to delay results in close seats. “Any additional votes in envelopes is tricky,” Ekin-Smyth said. “We don’t count any postal votes on the night. And if you have some close seats, you’ve got less votes counted, you’re less likely to get an indication on them.”",News/Australia news,"Spike in postal votes could delay results in closely fought seats in 2022 election, AEC says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/03/spike-in-postal-votes-could-delay-results-in-closely-fought-seats-in-2022-election-aec-says
5/3/2022,"Rotten teeth are rarely life-threatening, thanks to antibiotics. Tooth loss mainly affects people in later life and is strongly associated with ageing and decline – a subject that many people prefer not to think about. Dentists are to a considerable extent separate from the rest of the NHS, and especially from the big hospitals where attention on the health service tends to focus. A larger proportion of dental treatment is carried out privately than other forms of healthcare. NHS England’s last GP patient survey, before the March 2020 lockdown, found that 21% of people in the south-east have a private dentist. A combination of these factors probably explains why dentistry is often left out of discussions about the NHS. A sharp fall in the number of NHS dentists, combined with alarming regional disparities leading to “dental deserts” where there are few or none, shows how urgently this needs to change. The latest figure of 21,544 NHS dentists in England is the lowest for a decade, with acute shortages in counties including Lincolnshire and Norfolk. In Thurrock, Essex, just 26.1% of adults and 30.7% of children have seen a dentist in the past two years. Figures in several other areas are not much better. In Scotland, too, the British Dental Association has warned that most practices are likely to reduce their NHS commitment, with many dentists considering retiring. There are similar problems, only partly caused by the pandemic, in Wales and Northern Ireland. What dentistry requires, from politicians in the four administrations but also the NHS itself, is more attention. Without a joined-up policy response, there is every chance of further weakening and fragmentation. Based on the existing evidence, including last year’s report on oral health inequalities from Public Health England, this should be expected to strengthen the link between socioeconomic deprivation and poor outcomes, including mouth cancers as well as periodontal disease (which is also caused by smoking) and tooth decay in children. (Data on oral health inequalities related to ethnicity and other characteristics is less clear.) Over the longer term, there is an extraordinarily positive story to be told about teeth. In 1948, three-quarters of all British adults had dentures. In the NHS’s early years, dentists were overwhelmed by need. The rising cost of treatment is what led to the hugely controversial introduction of charges. More recently, dentistry has been characterised by an uneasy compromise between public and private. What this means in practice is many dentists providing one service to NHS patients (including children, pregnant women and some benefit claimants) and a range of additional treatments – often for cosmetic reasons – to those who can pay. As with consultants and GPs, the contracts under which such arrangements operate are complicated. But it is clear what is needed now. Increasing longevity means that we all need to take more care than ever, if we want to hold on to our teeth until old age. As with healthcare in general, prevention is infinitely preferable to cure. So areas lacking dentists must have them. Like the NHS’s wider staffing problems, this one cannot be fixed overnight. But if Sajid Javid wants to make a move in the right direction, he could announce straight away that the government will stop opposing the eminently sensible workforce planning amendment that peers have been trying to add to its health and care bill – and back it instead.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the dentist shortage: a gap that needs filling | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/02/the-guardian-view-on-the-dentist-shortage-a-gap-that-needs-filling
5/3/2022,"The adage, try before you buy, may be more apt for clothes than any other product. No matter how typical your proportions are, most brands use a “fit model” – a person whose job it is to try on their clothes – with their own unique body shape, which is why we are all subject to confusing variances within clothing sizes. Making sure something fits well is important for a long-lasting wardrobe, as poorly fitting garments can strain, stretch and ultimately break faster. Fit can also indicate how well something has been constructed, which is a good indication of its quality. This week, our experts take us inside the fitting room, and explain how a well-made garment will feel when you try it on. When you’re about to put a garment on, the first thing you might notice is whether or not it is lined. Depending on the garment, lining may or may not be necessary. Max Sanderson, a lecturer in fashion design at Parson’s Paris, says “if it’s a jacket for winter that’s made of a fabric that will be uncomfortable against the skin, then lining is good”. But a lightweight jacket for the summer will probably be more comfortable unlined. If a garment is tailored, lining is extremely important. The owner of vintage consignment store Shop Bruce, Dan Neilsenbeck, says this is because “lining conceals a garment’s construction and reduces strain, which increases its life”. Designer Bianca Spender says this can be applied to fitted garments more broadly. She says lining has an important role to play, taking some of the resistance off your movement, without pulling the outer fabric. But her “favourite silk dresses don’t have lining because there is nothing like the feeling of silk against your skin”. On that note, it’s important to consider what the lining is made of. Sanderson recommends lining made from cupro, which is a cellulose fibre (like viscose), because it breathes but is also very durable, or silk because it is a protein fibre so it has good thermal properties. “If I saw something with polyester lining, I would be concerned that I would sweat in the garment and be uncomfortable because it doesn’t breathe,” he says. Anyone that’s worked in retail will tell you women get very excited when clothes have pockets. Unlike in menswear, where there are usually pockets in every conceivable location, womenswear often leave them off, which is frustrating. Pockets mean you may not need to carry a bag, and they can also improve the silhouette of trousers or the line of a dress. The only thing more annoying than clothes without pockets is an insufficient pocket that can’t hold the weight of a phone. Sanderson says if you’re buying something you’ll be wearing regularly, you should make sure the pocket bag (the inside of your pocket) is made of durable fabric, like cotton or something heavier, so your keys, wallet or phone won’t tear a hole in it. It is even worth tucking your phone into a garment’s pocket while you’re trying it on, to make sure it doesn’t sag open or strain. If the item is made of delicate fabric for a special occasion (like a tuxedo), a durable pocket bag might upset the way it sits, so a subtle pocket bag will have to suffice in these cases. This is similar for the breast interior pocket on a jacket, which will need to be discrete. A well-constructed garment should not restrict your movement. When you try something on, there are a few small moves you can do to test how the garment feels. Spender says to be sure “you can drive a car, get a book off the top shelf, and sit down on a chair without exposure or pulling”. For a shirt, this might mean there is a square pleat in between your shoulder blades – this will allow more movement through the arms and body. Neilsenbeck says a good shirt will have a back yoke, which is the piece of fabric that runs from the back of your neck along your shoulders. He also suggests inspecting the buttons and buttonholes to ensure they’re well finished. If threads are already coming loose before a garment has made it out of the shop, the problem will only get worse when you bring it home. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning For jackets, Sanderson says make sure “there is enough room under the arm” for it to be practical all day. “If you wear big sweaters all the time, is [the jacket] going to work with the size of the garments underneath?” When trying trousers on, Spender says to check there are no creases on the crotch, and that the pants sit well on your body from all angles. Other things to look for in trousers are extra fabric in the hem and along the seams, so they can be made longer or let out a size if needed. Generally, the way a garment hangs on the body can indicate how well it’s been made. “It really should fall from the shoulders without pulling or dragging into the neck, armhole and around the sleeves,” Spender says. If you’re contemplating a dress or jumpsuit with a back zip, and you struggle to either undo or do it up on your own, will that be a problem? Perhaps you live with people who can help, but it might be worth considering if you’ll feel comfortable asking a stranger in a restaurant bathroom. Or if you have small children, a puppy or a job that involves working in the garden or cooking, it’s probably not wise to buy a jacquard silk coat for day-to-day wear. Not least because you won’t be able to machine wash it. Sanderson says it is important to consider what your day entails when you shop, to avoid buying clothes you’ll never wear. “You don’t buy a Maserati and drive it on the beach, so maybe you don’t wear a silk coat to carry your groceries,” he says.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Try before you buy: how to spot well-made clothes in the change room,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/03/try-before-you-buy-how-to-spot-well-made-clothes-in-the-change-room
5/3/2022,"The date 30 April 2022 will live in renown, not just for the NSW Waratahs, but more broadly for Australian rugby and the Super Rugby Pacific competition as a whole. The Waratahs upset the Crusaders 24-21 at Leichhardt Oval on Saturday afternoon to confirm the resurgence of the men in sky blue under new coach Darren Coleman. There has been a marked improvement in the Waratahs’ play this season, but no one saw that stunning result coming. NSW were rank outsiders, but that was not apparent as they took on the most successful team in the history of Super Rugby without the slightest hint of trepidation. The Crusaders were without their rested maestro, All Blacks five-eighth Richie Mo’unga, but they still had more than enough talent and experience to beat the Waratahs, who are in a rebuilding phase, and the result served as a huge confidence booster. A day later, the Brumbies followed the Waratahs with a convincing 42-25 win against the Hurricanes at GIO Stadium. Having won four of their last six matches against New Zealand opposition in Canberra, they were expected to beat the Hurricanes, although perhaps not by the eventual 17-point margin . The Brumbies were too efficient and well-structured for a dangerous, but ill-disciplined, Hurricanes outfit. Australian teams won 50% of their fixtures with New Zealand opposition over the weekend, which is something of an achievement these days. Without star five-eighth James O’Connor, the Reds just fell short, 27-25, against the Chiefs in Brisbane on Saturday night, while the Western Force surprisingly pushed the Blues 22-18 in Perth on Friday. It would be premature to suggest the trans-Tasman gap has closed, but it certainly appears to be narrowing. With the Brumbies’ 28-17 win against the Highlanders the previous week, Australian teams have now won more games (three) against the Kiwis than they did last year (two). It is vitally important for the Australian teams to start beating the New Zealanders, especially the top sides, to regain credibility and the support Australian rugby has lost in the last 15 to 20 years. Many of the fans who continue to support the Australian teams are diehards, but the game needs to reclaim the support of life-long fans who have deserted the game. Successful teams attract bigger crowds and higher television ratings, which drive the economy of the game. Sanzaar officials will also be delighted with the Waratahs’ win against the Crusaders, as it will help to restore the credibility of Super Rugby, which started in 1996 as a 12-team competition involving three of the best rugby countries in the world – Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The expansion and contraction of Super Rugby over the years alienated many fans and it will take a lot of hard work for the current format of 10 Australian and New Zealand teams plus two sides from the Pacific Islands to re-establish the competition. It is imperative for the Australian teams to continue to regain some kind of parity for Super Rugby to be taken seriously again as a major provincial competition. The close results at the weekend, including Fijian Drua’s 27-24 loss to the Highlanders in Suva, were signs of a healthy competition. But it was the Waratahs’ famous win against the Crusaders that has the potential to have a ripple effect beyond the borders of NSW to the world of rugby beyond. There is an old saying that when NSW is strong Australia is strong. A winning Wallabies team not only underpins the game in this country, but also adds value to international competition, particularly the Bledisloe Cup series with the All Blacks. No doubt Waratahs players, officials and fans will be talking about that win for many years to come, but NSW’s most important game is their next against Moana Pasifika, who gave the Melbourne Rebels a scare in Melbourne last Saturday night. The Waratahs must follow up with another good performance against Moana Pasifika, who they will be expected to beat. They will then complete their regular season games against New Zealand opposition – the Hurricanes, Highlanders and Blues. If the Waratahs fail to win any of these games, their victory against the Crusaders will be dismissed as an aberration, bringing undone all the good work that was achieved at Leichhardt Oval on Saturday. Before any champagne corks are popped, it should be remembered that the Waratahs beat the Crusaders in 2019 and look at what happened after that. But for the time being, at least, the Waratahs have put the “super” back into Super Rugby. It is now up to them and the other Australian teams to keep it there.",Sport/Sport,Waratahs deliver timely confidence boost for Australian rugby,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/may/03/waratahs-deliver-timely-confidence-boost-for-australian-rugby
5/3/2022,"When Betty Blythe bought into a manufactured home park, she had no idea that years later she’d been cutting back on groceries and scrapping her home insurance due to increases in rent. While she owns her home in southern Queensland, Blythe leases the land from the park owner, with rent going towards shared facilities and utilities. Her rent is now $31 a week more than what it was four years ago, and Blythe said as a pensioner every cent counts. “There’s no luxuries in this house. I only buy the basics; I can’t afford anything else,” the 75-year-old said. “I’m a gardener but I haven’t been to a nursery for two or three years because I can’t afford to go and have a really beautiful garden.” Her rent increase, which sees her paying $1,612 a year more than she used to, takes up more than 80% of the growth in the single age pension during that time, leaving only another $6 a week to cover cost increases for items like food and transport. When Blythe bought her home, her understanding of manufactured home parks didn’t expand much beyond the village’s glossy brochure of the retirement lifestyle on offer. The terms “market review” and “consumer prices index”, cited in her agreement as the methods used to calculate the rent hikes, meant nothing to her. “I had no idea what they were talking about,” she said. “Your whole life, you go to work, you get your wages and you live your life. CPI is never mentioned in everyday life.” Blythe’s experience is not uncommon, and the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal has dozens of cases listed showing manufactured home owners challenging rent increases in recent years. Under the state’s Manufacturing Homes Act, park owners are able to increase rent each year in line with inflation, or CPI. They are also allowed to charge more if they’ve incurred significant operational costs, and increase rent further every three years following a “market review”. Amanda Hess, senior lawyer for the Queensland Retirement Villages and Parks Service, said market reviews were particularly tough for owners, with weekly rental increases often hiked up to 15%. “People’s rents might be going up $30 a fortnight, which is a pretty significant hike for someone who’s on a fixed income, particularly if they are on an aged pension,” she said. “It is possible to dispute the valuation but … it’s a time consuming and exhausting process for elderly and often vulnerable homeowners to undertake.” Hess said that while there have been some important reforms made to the Manufactured Homes Act over the last few years, there is still more work to be done. “The act, and particularly the dispute resolution process it sets out, operates as if there is equal bargaining power between the parties, which is just not the case,” she said. “This is a space which is crying out for consumer protection legislation.” As a founding member of the Alliance Of Manufactured Home Owners, Brad Goodwin is calling for the act to be amended to remove market rent reviews. He is also pushing for annual rent increases to be measured against increases in the aged care and disability pensions. Goodwin says these properties are supposed to be an affordable alternative to retirement villages, with no entry and exit fees or daily accommodation payments required. Richard Homans pays $350 a fortnight in rent for a manufactured home on the Gold Coast. “We’re the bottom of the rung when it comes to homeowners,” Homans said. The 73-year-old pensioner unsuccessfully sought a reduction in a rental increase that was introduced after a market review in 2020, when he says the village’s bowling green was suffering issues with mould and drainage. “The park owners are supposed to maintain the facilities and if there is a loss of facility we’re entitled to a reduction in rent,” Homans said. Hometown Australia, which manages the facilities at the park, told Guardian Australia “mould buildup on the artificial bowls surface … is not uncommon” and that bowlers continued to play at the green “before and after the 2020 market review as the bowling green surface was usable”. The spokesperson said the bowling green was later upgraded by the company at a total cost of $130,000. Hometown Australia says it is permitted under legislation to increase site rents commensurate with the terms of site agreements, and recognises “the financial effects of rising site rents in the current economic climate”. “In 2019, Hometown Australia (Park Owner) relaxed site rents to assist home owners by not applying the annual increase despite being legislatively able to,” the spokesperson said. “Hometown Australia continued offering lower increases to home owners in the 2020 market review.” Homans also battled both the previous and current park owners over their attempts to charge residents separately for sewerage. In February QCAT ordered Gateway Lifestyle, which was acquired by Hometown Australia in 2018, to pay one resident $711.16 for sewerage costs from 2017 to 2019 which it “was not entitled to charge”. Hometown Australia said sewerage charges had been implemented by the previous owner but had since been removed for all residents. South Brisbane MP, Amy MacMahon, has raised the issue of rental spikes for manufactured home owners in state parliament on several occasions. Like Goodwin, she believes the act needs to be reformed. “We’re in a housing crisis here in Queensland,” she told Guardian Australia. “The Manufactured Homes Act does little to balance the inherently unequal relationship between wealthy corporations who own the parks, and the retirees and pensioners who live in them. “Real reform should put the power back in the hands of residents, ban market rent reviews and ban CPI rent increases.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A spokesperson from Queensland’s Department of Housing said the government is aware that site rent increases and market rent reviews “can be a source of anxiety” for manufactured home owners. The spokesperson said the government will release an issue paper and survey in mid-2022 which will cover “issues associated with site rent increases and unsold homes.” Homeowners are entitled to dispute a site rent increase if they believe it is excessive, they said. “If the dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation between the homeowner and the park owner, it may be escalated to the QCAT. “The government also funds the Queensland Retirement Village and Park Advice Service to provide free legal information and advice to manufactured homeowners, including how to dispute a site rent increase.”",News/Australia news,Queensland’s rental crisis spreads to manufactured home parks,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/03/queenslands-rental-crisis-spreads-to-manufactured-home-parks
5/3/2022,"Extreme weather due to the climate crisis is expected to increasingly make some Australian homes “uninsurable”, with a new report suggesting up to one in 25 households will struggle to be covered by 2030. The analysis by the Climate Council, using data from consultants Climate Valuation, mapped the 10 electorates across the country considered most at risk of becoming uninsurable due to flood, fire and other extreme weather risk. The most at-risk areas were mostly found to be in flood and cyclone-prone areas of Queensland and in parts of Victoria built over flood plains near major rivers. “Uninsurable” is defined in the report as an area where the required type of insurance product was expected to be not available, or only available at such high cost that no one could afford it. Nicki Hutley, an economist and member of the Climate Council who wrote the report, said insurance costs were already rising sharply and people were struggling to get insurance in parts of the country. She said people were seeing changes, citing the black summer bushfires and the recent devastating floods in northern New South Wales. Hutley said the report highlighted the level of “under-insurance” across the country, a term that refers to situations in which a property was covered for lesser risks but not for the greatest threat in the area where they lived. ASIC has previously estimated the rate of under-insurance in the country may be up to 80%. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The report includes a tool that shows how the risk of different catastrophes, and uninsurability, grows under different scenarios over timeframes out to 2100. People can enter their address to see how their property is expected to be affected. It suggested up to 27% of properties in the electorate of Nicholls, in northern Victoria, and 20% of properties in Richmond, in New South Wales, could soon be uninsurable due to flood plain risk. Dr Karl Mallon, chief executive of Climate Valuation, said the company aimed to make risks visible to homeowners, insurance companies and authorities. “The underlying technology is indeed intended to give people an understanding whether a property has insurance challenges in the way an insurance industry does not,” he said. The Climate Council report used generalised assumptions about the type of building at each address: that each is a single storey, detached house built using recent design specifications and materials. The replacement costs were conservatively assumed to be $314,000 a home, based on Australian Bureau of Statistics data of the average cost. It categorises a property as uninsurable if the expected annual cost of damage is more than 1% of the rebuild cost. Not everyone working in the field is convinced a totally accurate house-by-house analysis is possible. Sharanjit Paddam, an expert in climate and environmental risk at Finity Consulting, said the report was “really important” at a broad level, particularly if it started to “make people think about whether climate change is going to affect their property, and their insurance costs”. But he said he would be reluctant to say some areas would be totally uninsurable as there was always uncertainty about models that have to make “really difficult assumptions for which we don’t necessarily have all the information available”. “The results won’t necessarily be correct at an individual home level but it will give a good guide to where the areas of risk are,” Paddam said. “However, I don’t think the eight years is an exaggeration because the risk is here today, and we know this is the case because the government has intervened in cyclone costs to make it more affordable today. He said there were also costs involved in doing nothing. “Not doing anything about climate change is the most expensive option and I think this report makes that very clear,” he said.",News/Business,"Flood and cyclone-prone areas in eastern Australia may be ‘uninsurable’ by 2030, report suggests ",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/03/flood-and-cyclone-prone-areas-in-eastern-australia-may-be-uninsurable-by-2030-report-suggests
5/3/2022,"At its simplest, press freedom is about truth: the ability to report and publish the truth, without fear or favour. In that critical endeavour, whistleblowers – truth-tellers – play an essential role. It is a dark stain on our democracy that Australia still has several public interest whistleblowers on trial. Richard Boyle, David McBride and Bernard Collaery all face potential jail time for speaking up about serious wrongdoing. It is an indictment on our legal and political system that they continue to be prosecuted for holding power to account. Collaery, a distinguished Canberra lawyer and former Australian Capital Territory (ACT) attorney general, is alleged to have spoken to the media about Australia’s treatment of our neighbour, Timor-Leste. It is alleged that Australia spied on Timor-Leste to gain an upper hand in oil and gas negotiations in the early 2000s, for commercial gain. Collaery has pleaded not guilty; his former client, intelligence officer Witness K, pleaded guilty to a lesser offence last year, and was given a suspended sentence. McBride, a former defence lawyer, blew the whistle on alleged war crimes committed by Australian forces in Afghanistan. Boyle, meanwhile, spoke up about unethical practices within the Australian Taxation Office. All three blew the whistle to the national broadcaster, the ABC. The complexity and opacity surrounding these three cases is nothing short of staggering, particularly given they have all been vindicated. No one seriously denies that Australia bugged Timor-Leste’s cabinet office – the renegotiation of bilateral agreements following international legal action was a tacit admission. The Brereton Report provided a damning forensic assessment of the actions of Australian forces in Afghanistan; criminal investigations are ongoing. Several independent inquiries, including by the Senate, have condemned the aggressive debt recovery practices exposed by Boyle. Yet despite the accountability and change their whistleblowing has helped achieve, all three men continue to face criminal charges. On this of all days, it is worth reflecting on their plight – and the government’s responsibility. Whistleblowers make Australia a better place. They hold governments who commit wrongdoing to account. They shine light on the darkest of acts. Prosecuting whistleblowers – especially those who exposed government wrongdoing – is undemocratic. It has a chilling effect. There is no public interest in prosecuting these truth-tellers. They should be protected, not punished. Fortunately, there is a simple solution. The attorney general has the power, at both common law and under the Judiciary Act, to drop a prosecution at any time. It is an exceptional power, rarely used. But exceptional powers exist for exceptional circumstances. Given the highly political nature of these prosecutions – the case against Collaery was expressly approved by Christian Porter while he was attorney general – political intervention is justified. Ultimately, the current attorney general is accountable for these unjust prosecutions. Whoever wins government at the May election must commit to immediately dropping the prosecutions of Collaery, McBride and Boyle, all of which have been dragging on for years. The Collaery case is particularly Kafka-esque, with the government ceaseless in its quest for secrecy in which to shroud the trial. Most recently, the attorney general appealed to the high court to keep secret a judgment that refused a secret trial (the high court deferred the matter). At court hearings later this year, McBride and Boyle will argue that they are protected from prosecution by federal whistleblowing law, the Public Interest Disclosure Act (PID). That law provides that whistleblowers can go public in certain circumstances. Boyle and McBride thought they were following the rules – speaking up internally first, then to oversight bodies, and only then to the media as a last resort. If they are unsuccessful, they will go on trial. But even a PID Act victory would be pyrrhic – both have endured significant emotional trauma, just for speaking up. These whistleblowers have suffered financially and psychologically for doing the right thing. They have already paid the price. This reinforces the urgent need for law reform. The PID Act was independently reviewed in 2016, with significant changes recommended. Six years later, and 18 months since the government promised to accept most of the review’s recommendations, the law remains untouched. Both major parties must also commit to reform the PID Act before the end 2022. In recent years, Australian whistleblowers have worked with journalists to reveal exploitative conduct by Australian banks, the mistreatment of migrant workers, the suffering of people in aged care and disability settings, and alleged war crimes in Afghanistan. But while there is so much that Australians now know thanks to the courage of individual whistleblowers, we need to be concerned about what we don’t know – and what stories may never be told – because people are too afraid to speak up. Our major parties should take a simple but seismic step towards upholding press freedom, by promising to drop these prosecutions and fix our national whistleblowing law if elected.

5/3/2022,"Each year, high school teacher and artist Adele Chapman-Burgess takes her year eight class to the Myall Creek memorial in north-east New South Wales. It was here, in June 1838, that at least 28 Wirrayaraay people were killed in a massacre by white stockmen, their bodies later piled up and burned. The students are “blown away when they see the memorial”, she says, which includes a walking trail and a large stone with a brass plaque, on which a vandal at one point scratched out the word “murdered”. The Myall Creek murders set a judicial precedent: seven stockmen were convicted of the deaths and hanged six months later, although one free settler among the perpetrators evaded capture, living comfortably in plain sight for the rest of his life. A further four defendants walked free, after an Aboriginal eyewitness mysteriously disappeared. The massacres that claimed thousands of Aboriginal men, women and children’s lives across Australia between 1788 and 1930 continue to be mapped by the University of Newcastle and Guardian Australia, but largely went unpunished at the time. Speakers at a truth-telling panel on the Myall Creek massacre, hosted on Saturday by the Arts and Cultural Exchange at Parramatta, criticised an “ignorance” among many Australians about our frontier history, calling for more education of teachers and students, as well as greater Indigenous self-determination of the terms on which historical truths can be told. Panellist Chapman-Burgess, a Ngarrabul/Gamilaraay/Yuwaalaray/Kooma woman – and a descendant of the same language group as the Wirrayaraay – called on universities to “step up” by expanding their “tokenistic” Aboriginal histories modules so that teachers can “feel comfortable talking about Aboriginal history, culture and telling the truth”. Chapman-Burgess is a member of the national committee of the friends of Myall Creek, which includes descendants of the massacre’s perpetrators, victims and survivors. Each June they meet at the site in reconciliation, to light commemorative candles and acknowledge inter-generational trauma. Keith Munro is co-chair of the committee. He says having descendants of both sides come together each of the past 22 years sets an example for effective reconciliation. “It’s not just our history, it’s also your history. As 10th generation Australians, there is no separation, there is no us and them.” Saturday’s panel spoke of the continuing denial that massacres took place in Australia, and the pressure to use euphemisms in the education system. Chapman-Burgess said her school executive has fielded phone calls of objection (she doesn’t say from whom) asking her to avoid the word “massacre” on student permission slips to attend the memorial. “Sorry, no,” she tells them, adding her school backs her up. A Dharug panel member, Lesley Woodhouse, told the meeting: “What we are seeing in schools is kids are parroting their parents, and parents have views that are based on no education about this … Give kids the opportunity to listen, to hear another side of the story,” she says. “We don’t have to keep telling them the same lie. This not calling a massacre a massacre is ridiculous.” There are plans to add an educational and memorial keeping place for artefacts at Myall Creek, provided funding can be secured. This might mean a permanent home for a 30-panel Myall Creek gathering cloak made by community artists on possum skins, which tells songline stories around water, originally created for a 2018 exhibition and currently on display at Sydney’s National Art School as part of Sydney Biennale. Another panellist, Dharug man Chris Tobin, noted that despite the plethora of cenotaphs and statues for Australians fighting overseas, there was until recent times “nothing” for Aboriginal people “who fought to defend their own country”. This fact propelled a reconciliation group, of which Tobin was a part, to approach the St John of God hospital to erect a memorial at a massacre site at Richmond Hill, where a battle took place in 1795 between Dharug people and the New South Wales Corps. “Don’t wait for the government,” he said. “Bugger waiting for the government.” Memorials are “more meaningful” when put together by Aboriginal groups in consultation with community, said Dharug panellist Julie Bakari Webb. “That’s our traditional right under lore and business,” she said. “That’s not the place of government or councils or anyone else to be able to tell us how to memorialise.” In 2017, the Uluru Statement from the Heart was released, which called for a constitutionally enshrined First Nations voice to parliament and a Makarrata commission “to supervise a process of agreement-making between governments and First Nations and truth-telling about our history”. “Governments have really struggled since the day dot to establish a genuine relationship with Aboriginal people,” said Keith Munro. “The ignorance in regard to our frontier history can also be echoed in the ignorance a lot of Australians have to just simple things, like how Aboriginal funding actually works. [Most funding for Aboriginal programs] gets chewed up in administrative costs.” Whichever political party forms federal government after the 21 May election, Myall Creek committee member Kelvin Brown said it must be Indigenous people, not governments, that set the terms of reference for truth-telling. “There are stories out there that will never be known … we will never know the true amount of those atrocities,” he said, but emphasised there were more stories waiting to be uncovered, which should be reported to massacre investigators. “Right across this nation, one end to the other, top and down, left and right, there were massacres everywhere,” he said. “We all have a responsibility to talk about it … as a nation … discuss it, remember it, record it.”",News/Australia news,‘Not calling a massacre a massacre is ridiculous’: a model of truth-telling at Myall Creek,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/03/not-calling-a-massacre-a-massacre-is-ridiculous-a-model-of-truth-telling-at-myall-creek
5/3/2022,"Support for both the major parties has dropped since the start of the federal election campaign, but Labor is emerging as the party most trusted to manage the cost of living pressures facing Australians. At the mid-point of the six-week election campaign, the Guardian Essential poll of 1,500 respondents finds the primary vote for both Labor and the Coalition largely unmoved, despite billions of dollars in election promises being made as voters tune into the contest. But while primary support is flatlining, Labor retains a lead over the Coalition of 49% to 45% on a two-party preferred “plus” measure. The challenge to connect with disengaged voters is also highlighted by the fact that 17% of people say they have not been paying any attention to the news, advertising or updates from the federal election campaign, and 33% saying they have only been paying little attention. The latest survey shows the Coalition’s primary vote is at 36% – down from 37% a fortnight ago and back to where it was at the beginning of April, while Labor’s primary support is unchanged at 35%. At the beginning of April, Labor’s primary support was 36%. The Greens are polling 10%, the United Australia Party 4%, One Nation 3%, and independents and other parties 5%. Six per cent of people are still undecided. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning On the 2PP+ metric, Labor’s increase to 49% is up two points in the past fortnight, with the Coalition dropping to 45% and the undecided vote down to just 6%. Essential’s voting intention figures express the head-to-head metric of the major party contest as two-party preferred “plus”, rather than the standard two-party preferred measure. It has a 3% margin of error. This change in methodology, adopted after the 2019 election, highlights the proportion of undecided voters in any survey, providing accuracy on the limits of any prediction. The Coalition’s support is higher among older voters, men, and people in New South Wales and Queensland. For the first time, the Coalition has also won over more female voters than Labor, 34% to 32%, but this remains within the poll’s margin of error. Labor’s support is stronger in Victoria and among 18- to 34-year-olds and 35- to 54-year-olds. But while the major parties are struggling to win the support of voters, the poll has also found a large drop in the number of people who feel that “Australia is heading in the right direction” compared to a fortnight ago. Just under half of respondents (41%) say Australia is heading in the right direction, while 43% of people say the country is on the “wrong track”. When this question was asked a fortnight ago, 46% of respondents said they believed Australia was going in the right direction, with 37% saying we are on the wrong track. As cost of living pressures take centre stage in the election campaign, with inflation at 20-year highs and expectations that interest rates will begin rising as soon as Tuesday, voters say hip pocket concerns have become the most important to them. Four out of five (79%) of voters listed cost of living as important, with 47% ranking it very important. It is the most important issue, ahead of improving public services (69%), job security (60%) and climate change (54%). Almost half of all voters rank paying down government debt and the relationship between China and Solomon Islands as important (47%), while the issue of boat turnbacks is seen as a priority by 41% of people. The poll also found that 27% of people believe the debate over the participation of transgender people in sport is important, with 11% rating the issue – thrust into the spotlight by Warringah Liberal candidate, Katherine Deves – as “very important”. On the cost of living, 40% of voters judged that Labor was best placed to manage the issue, compared to 30% who trust the Coalition on the issue, and 30% who deemed both parties to be no different. Labor also outranked the Coalition on voter trust for improving public services such as health and welfare (44% to 26%), job security (38% to 29%) and the climate crisis (40% to 21%.) About 10% of people report difficulty being able to pay bills, while about a third of all voters (34%) say they are “struggling a bit”, and have to watch the budget. Most people (39%) say they are “secure”, and are able to pay bills and “usually have money spare for savings or buying luxuries.” Just 18% of people describe themselves as comfortable. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has been campaigning on the risk of a change of government to Labor, seizing on the economic uncertainty to tell voters to stick with what they know rather than chance opposition leader Anthony Albanese. Labor has been running a small-target campaign offering safe change, while also focused on promising voters cost of living relief through its childcare, housing, Medicare and energy policies. Just 33% of people believe the government deserves to be re-elected, while 46% agree with the statement that it “is time to give someone else a go”. In response to questions about the likely fate of the government, 56% believe that Labor will win the coming contest, compared to 44% who believe the Coalition will be re-elected.",News/Australia news,Guardian Essential poll: Labor maintains lead as major parties struggle to reach disengaged voters,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/03/guardian-essential-poll-labor-maintains-lead-as-major-parties-struggle-to-reach-disengaged-voters
5/3/2022,"Philip Lowe, governor of the Reserve Bank, will preside over one of the institution’s most critical and sensitive meetings on Tuesday when his board meets to decide whether to lift the official cash rate during the election campaign. The high-stakes decision follows last week’s spike in both core and headline inflation to their highest levels in more than 20 years. With so much riding on it, how does the RBA make its determination and what is the likely outcome? The RBA hasn’t raised interest rates since November 2010, on the same day Americain won the Melbourne Cup. In other words, so long ago, few can remember it. The last time the RBA lifted rates during an election was in 2007 when governor Glenn Stevens and his board hiked the rate by 0.25 percentage points to 6.75%. The move angered then prime minister John Howard who went on to lose his seat and the election. Interestingly, the bank under the current governor Lowe waited until after the 2019 election before cutting the cash rate by 25 basis points to 1.25% in June of that year. Scott Morrison has tried to blunt criticism that a Tuesday rate rise would be a poor reflection on his government’s economic management, blaming international factors for the high inflation. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, also pointed to previous comments by Lowe – including in last month’s board meeting – that the RBA wanted to see inflation and wage data before lifting the rate from its now record low 0.1%. Labor’s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, meanwhile, says he’s “disappointed” that Frydenberg’s comments undermine the RBA’s independence. He and other Labor bigwigs are also hedging their bets, saying rates will rise a lot whether the first hike is in May or June. (Markets predict the rate will start climbing from May onwards.) The RBA board has nine members, all of whom have been appointed by the Coalition government in their current roles. Lowe, though, first joined the board as a deputy governor in 2012 during the Labor government led by Julia Gillard. Women make up most of the board for the first time following the abrupt exit of deputy governor Guy Debelle in March, with Michele Bullock stepping up to fill the role. Most non-officials have tended to be in business, including Mark Barnaba, deputy chair of mining giant Fortescue. Ian Harper, director of the Melbourne Business School, held roles including the inaugural fair pay commissioner, and is also on the board of the right-leaning Robert Menzies Institute. Wendy Craik, a former head of the National Farmers Federation, has also served in a number of government roles mostly appointed by Coalition governments, such as the now all-but-defunct Climate Change Authority. Steven Kennedy, who is a board member by dint of being treasury secretary, is arguably the most political appointment. James Morley, a University of Sydney professor who has worked on central banks from North America to New Zealand, said having the treasury secretary on the board set Australia apart from similar countries, such as Canada. Even so, the RBA is “still a fairly independent central bank”. Unlike in the US or the UK, the RBA doesn’t disclose how board members vote. The central bank itself says only that “consistent with the Reserve Bank Act, the board makes decisions by a majority of the members present, with the chair having a casting vote”. Before the meetings, RBA staff provide board members with information about the economy to help them prepare. Staff, other board members, and Lowe himself would often make presentations. “So the idea that we kind of just go along and I say, ‘Interest rates aren’t changing,’ they say, ‘Yes. Yes, let’s go to lunch.’ That’s completely fanciful,” he said, adding that a “collective exploration … [is] the way that I like to do things”. “By nature, I like to find the consensus that I need to explore through the shades of the murky wall of grey I live in, and that’s what we do,” Lowe said. Mariano Kulish, another University of Sydney professor, who worked at the RBA until 2010, said the staff would typically provide a recommendation that would be discussed. “I don’t know there’s been many instances in which the board has not gone with the staff recommendation or the governor’s decision,” Kulish says. Both Kulish and Morley are part of the ANU-based Shadow RBA board which tries to anticipate the RBA decision. Their view was “marginally in favour of cash rate rise” on Tuesday, although the verdict was only 53:47, Morley said. Financial markets, though, have reduced their expectation of a rate rise, according to an ASX tracker. A separate measure also pared the prediction for a May rise while predicting a firm move of the cash rate target to 0.5% by the June meeting. Why would the RBA hold back despite the CPI coming in at 5.1% for the March quarter? After all, that’s the highest level – excluding the introduction of the GST in 2000 – since the mid-1990s. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning For one thing, the inflation push is so far coming from higher energy prices and supply constraints caused by Covid. What happens if, somewhat miraculously, those issues reversed – would the RBA cut interest rates, Morley asks? “There is still good reason for the RBA to wait to June and raise the cash rate by 0.4 percentage points in response to the sustained and broad-based increases in prices,” Sarah Hunter, a KPMG economist said. “A June increase would allow the RBA to act outside the election campaign, and with the benefit of seeing the Wage Price Index release [on 18 May] before deciding on the size of the upward movement.” The RBA, though, would also be watching its overseas counterparts. Central banks in the US, the UK, New Zealand and elsewhere have already been raising rates, sometimes for months. The longer Australia waits, the more pressure will be placed on the Australian dollar, Kulish notes. The currency has already dropped from the mid-70 US cent range to just above 70 US cents. Further falls – which will be more likely the longer Australian interest rates stay near zero as others’ rise – will only end up importing more inflation, which the RBA will have to stamp harder on later, he said.",News/Australia news,Interest rate rise: who makes the high-stakes decision and how does it get made?  ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/03/interest-rate-rise-who-makes-the-high-stakes-decision-and-how-does-it-get-made
5/3/2022,"The 19th-century Birmingham pastor Robert Dale would have been dismayed by today’s apathy towards local elections. As one of the greatest proselytisers for the role of municipal government in Victorian England, Dale made it his job to celebrate the virtues of public-spirited service in the interests of the community: “If we are true to each other and true to the town,” he suggested in one 1881 sermon, “we may do deeds as great as those done by Pisa, Florence and Venice in their triumphant days.” Slightly ambitious perhaps. Nevertheless, such pioneering idealism inspired an era of civic achievement that transformed England’s towns and cities. But the better housing, libraries, swimming pools and schools would not have been possible without locally controlled revenues, which were then hoovered up by the centralising state in the 20th century. The Thatcher era, in which metropolitan councils were distrusted as dangerous sites of socialist experimentation, led to a further concentration of powers in the centre. Under David Cameron and George Osborne, local councils subsequently became the fall guys of austerity, forced to swallow crippling cuts to grants from Westminster. The journey away from localism – notwithstanding recent innovations such as the metro mayors – has helped to create one of Europe’s most economically unbalanced countries, draining regional politics of its prestige and capacity to make a real impact in vital areas. In a major study last week, the Institute for Government reported that local administration in England had been “hollowed out” since 2010, and is forced increasingly to limit itself to the provision of statutory services. Three-quarters of controllable local authority spending now goes on social care. Amid rising demand and costs, this comes increasingly at the expense of other neighbourhood services. Between 2010 and 2020, for example, library closures and reduced hours led to a 52% reduction in visits. The government aspires to address a crisis made worse by its predecessors through its levelling up agenda. Its white paper on this subject makes important points, suggesting that greater agency for local leaders and communities can restore pride to places that have felt neglected by London. This is a sentiment that Pastor Dale could happily endorse. But without significantly enhanced revenue-raising powers, including the ability to borrow more freely, the promised devolution risks delivering responsibility without power. Meanwhile, levelling up funds have so far been parcelled out at the whim of Westminster. The public continue to draw their own conclusions. At last year’s council elections, roughly two-thirds of those eligible to vote failed to do so. At a time when the level of popular cynicism towards Westminster has soared, such desultory numbers testify to another layer of deep disaffection with the way our politics works. One of the key ideas in the government’s levelling up white paper is “empowerment” – a buzzword of our times because so many people think there is far too little of it. As this newspaper has argued, electoral reform and greater proportional representation would help address this deficit at a national level. Lower down England’s political pyramid, real resources are needed that would belatedly allow local knowledge and imagination to be fruitfully deployed. After Thursday’s polls, the media’s overwhelming focus will be on what the results mean for Boris Johnson and Sir Keir Starmer. England’s cities, towns and villages deserve better.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on local democracy: make it matter | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/02/the-guardian-view-on-local-democracy-make-it-matter
5/3/2022,"There was a smile from Unai Emery when the stats were read out to him the day before what could well the biggest night in Villarreal’s history: not just the team but the town. This season Liverpool have played 56 games and lost only three, and never by more than two goals. In other words, Jürgen Klopp’s team have not endured the kind of result that Villarreal will have to inflict upon them to progress to the Champions League final. “You’ve done a good job finding that stat,” the Villarreal coach said. “We had them but I didn’t want to say so. That shows you how difficult it will be to turn it round, but we will work on the game and see if we can. We’ll have to produce a perfect game, reach excellence or get close to it to be able to do something that no one has done to them.” Villarreal will have to be better than in the first leg certainly and Emery sees hope in playing the second leg at home. There, he said, he hopes his team can find the play that he conceded they were unable to produce in the first meeting, where they were reduced to resisting. That, though, does not necessarily mean opening up and he said his team would have to defend well – the central defender Pau Torres expressed his hope for a “long” game, saying “one goal puts us right back in it and it doesn’t matter if it’s in the first minute or the 60th”. Asked what makes the second game different, Emery said: “First, we’re at home with our fans. Second, we have to win. Third, we have to defend, but there are lots of ways of defending. We have to do a brutal defensive performance and from that base be able to find something we could not find there [in Liverpool], which is our play. Over 90 minutes, in their ground, they were favourites, they were better than us, no complaints. “It is hard to turn around a 2-0. It benefits us that there is no away goals [rule] so it’s a bit more natural to play for a win. We have to find ways of scoring. The ‘home’ factor was very important there and we would like to have a little difference in our favour here. “This is a town where of course not everyone likes football here but they do all identify with Villarreal because they have that feeling of belonging; 23,000 people will be there and we want to play to be in the final. They have a big lead but we’re not here just to end it.” Emery was reminded of a comeback his Arsenal side had produced against Rennes, in which they recovered from a 3-1 first-leg deficit to go through in the Europa League round of 16 in 2019. Although he admitted there were “certain parallels”, he said “this time the level is much higher”. He described Thiago Alcântara as offering a “tremendous” performance in the first leg, labelled Fabinho’s career path “extraordinary” and insisted Liverpool were the “best team in the world”. “We’re at home, we have to be focused, and find a great response against a very complete team, one that plays with a tremendous confidence, a feeling of superiority, one that loses very little,” he said. “We have to look for our chance, try to face them in duels and win those duels. To have got here we have needed a huge effort; now we have to try to reach excellence.”",Sport/Football,Unai Emery claims Villarreal will need ‘perfect game’ to beat Liverpool,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/02/unai-emery-says-villarreal-will-need-perfect-game-to-beat-liverpool
5/3/2022,"Organizers of the 2022 Met Gala are weathering widespread criticism for the event’s theme, “Gilded Glamor and White Tie”, facing accusation of insensitivity to the worsening inflation most Americans are dealing with. The annual gala’s sartorial theme follows the second part of curator Andrew Bolton’s two-part exhibition In America: An Anthology of Fashion, which explores the origins of American fashion. However, many onlookers have used social media to condemn Monday evening’s event for its extravagance and luxury as the nation grapples with a shrinking economy. As “Gilded Glamour and White Tie” pays homage to the period of rapid prosperity, industrialization and growth in the US from 1870 to 1890, some have called it “out of touch”. One user tweeted: “Am I the only one who thinks this years #MetGala theme is out of touch? inequality is at the highest levels since the Gilded Age, a pandemic & economic meltdown wrecked us, inflation is out of control … but cool, let’s wear #GildedAge themed dresses & laugh about inequality … this year’s theme is a slap in the face to average Americans.” Another user pointed out the irony of such a theme amid the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, writing: “Gilded glamor at a time of war, let them eat cake,” referencing a quote commonly attributed to the French queen Marie Antoinette, who during the French Revolution allegedly suggested that starving peasants lacking bread could eat cake. Last quarter, the American economy shrank for the first time since the recession that struck during the pandemic two years ago. US GDP fell by about 0.35% from January to March, or at an annualized rate of 1.4%, prompting experts to point to rising inflation, the Omicron variant and supply chain issues as factors. The rising inflation and economic contraction suggests America’s economy is at a greater risk of a downturn, especially as Russia’s war in Ukraine continues to pummel the global economy. “It’s too-on-the-nose for the Met Gala to have a ‘Gilded Age’ theme on the same day we know the US economy is contracting,” a Business Insider reporter tweeted. “The met gala this year is going to piss off people. The theme being gilded glamour??? And with everything going on this year yeah people will be mad lol,” another user tweeted. Each year, the gala draws out the rich and powerful to raise money for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute, which is the only department at the museum that is required to raise its own funds. The cost for a seat at last year’s gala started at $35,000, although some guests on the highly selective guest list are invited free of charge. The event, which is the institute’s primary source of income, raised more than $16.4m last year. Last year’s gala also spurred controversy, as the Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wore a white gown that said “Tax the Rich”. The dress sparked backlash across the political spectrum, with critics condemning the move as both hypocritical and performative. Ocasio-Cortez defended her actions, saying: “The medium is the message.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,Met Gala organizers face criticism for ‘Gilded Glamor’ theme amid inflation,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/may/02/met-gala-theme-gilded-glamor-criticism-inflation
5/3/2022,"Trent Alexander-Arnold has called on Liverpool to crown a “very special season” with a place in the history books as Jürgen Klopp’s quadruple chasers attempt to secure a third Champions League final appearance in five campaigns. Liverpool visit Villarreal in the semi-finals on Tuesday leading 2-0 from the first leg with a 100% win record on the road in the competition this season. Alexander-Arnold said in February that one trophy per season should be the minimum expectation for a squad of Liverpool’s quality. But with the team close to an unprecedented quadruple in the final month of the campaign, the 23-year-old right-back has revised his target. “I did say one trophy a season minimum and that is in a season that isn’t our best, but we are in fine form and have been able to win in different ways,” Alexander-Arnold said. “When you are staring down the barrel and looking at more trophies, where if we win every game we are looking at more silverware, that is what we are looking at. These kinds of games are exciting for us. “This time last year we were trying to fight back into the top four and secure the Champions League. Now we are second in the league – a point off [Manchester] City – and in the FA Cup final. Who can complain? This is a very special season for us all and hopefully we will see it through, and at the end we will be in the history books again.” Alexander-Arnold said Liverpool must treat every game as a final and, despite the pressure on each fixture, he believes the defining phase of a season brings the best out of Klopp’s players. “I feel like we thrive off it,” he said. “This is always the best time of the season. Every game is a final, pushing on all three fronts. These are the exciting games: you want to be playing in these, you want everything on the line, you want every game to feel like you have to win it. It is exciting, the buzz you get from scoring a goal and knowing how important it is.” Alexander-Arnold cited Naby Keïta’s goal on Saturday and Jordan Henderson’s deflected cross against Villarreal as significant moments for the club this season. “Those goals give you a different feeling that this is big, this is massive. Same with the three points. These are the best times we are going to have as a team.” Liverpool dominated Villarreal last week and restricted Unai Emery’s side to one shot, none on target. One attempt is the joint-fewest in a Champions League semi-final since the data started being recorded in 2003-04. Emery vowed Liverpool would see a different side to Villarreal in the second leg and Klopp, whose team have been behind for 69 minutes in 2022, accepts the visitors will have to suffer at times. Klopp said: “Obviously with the situation we are in we must have done something right but the problem in our job is everything is perfect and then the next game starts on the wrong foot and then all of a sudden the game gets a different dynamic. It is good to know [the 69 minutes statistic] and it is more a feeling inside, not that we are flying constantly and high-fiving here and there, but we know we are in a good moment. “But, on the other side, what would you do if you had lost 2-0 away, are maybe not happy with your performance knowing you can do better, and with the crowd behind you? My only concern is what we do tomorrow night and we have to be ready to suffer but without going down. That can happen in football matches: they have the first shot on target, the crowd goes up, with each challenge the crowd goes up again. “A good example was Newcastle. The crowd was obviously very passionate but we did not let it happen, which was the biggest quality of this game.

5/3/2022,"Mundher Al-Adhami, who has died suddenly aged 79, was a maths teacher who moved into research and development. In this work he focused on the structure of progression in learning and on constructing lessons that encourage active engagement in mathematical thinking for all children. A passionate intellectual activist and writer, Mundher was always trying to understand the world and working to improve it, whether in education or Middle Eastern politics. He was a generous collaborator and stimulating friend. Born in Baghdad, he was one of 16 children of Fatima Jawad Asia and Nouman Mohammed Al-Adhami, a grain wholesaler. After attending Markazia high school, he left Iraq to study geophysics at the universities of Moscow and Durham. Throughout his life, he was involved in publishing for and leading Iraqi and Palestinian solidarity movements, and was a member of the BRussells tribunal on the Iraq war. With his second wife, Haifa Zangana, whom he met at a political demonstration in 1988 and married in 1992, he later endowed prizes for Iraqi writers. He had several temporary teaching posts in Durham but the first permanent post was at Elliott school in Putney, south-west London, where he moved to in 1974, then John Archer school in Wandsworth, which later merged into Wandsworth school. When I first met him, he was head of maths there. He then moved to become a key member of the project team of graded assessment in mathematics (Gaim) at King’s College London, developing a teacher-assessed scheme for 11- to 16-year-olds that could be traded in for a final GCSE grade. The job involved researching and trialling a framework of progression in understanding, partly assessed by individual and group problem-solving, and later administering the Gaim GCSE. Two related projects at King’s followed, one secondary and one primary, on cognitive acceleration in mathematics education (Came), working with teachers to develop crafted “thinking maths” lessons based on the Gaim framework and informed by cognitive psychology. All these projects gave rise to published teacher resources and academic books and papers, to which Mundher richly contributed. He continued as chief executive of the educational consultancy Cognitive Acceleration Associates, and founder of the charity Let’s Think Forum, working with schools to improve their teaching of maths. While latterly enjoying his winters in Tunisia, Mundher continued writing, editing and collaborating internationally right up to his death, contributing with his customary wisdom, humanity and passion to both politics and maths teaching. He is survived by Haifa, his two children, Youssef and Rheem, from his first marriage to Helen (nee Vesey), from whom he was divorced, four grandchildren, a stepdaughter, and 10 of his 15 siblings.",News/Education,Mundher Al-Adhami obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/02/mundher-al-adhami-obituary
5/3/2022,"One of the UK’s most wanted men has been arrested after trying to fly to Portugal using a fraudulent passport. Alex Male, 29, of Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, is alleged to have been a regional distributor of class A drugs across the south-west of England, using an EncroChat encrypted communications network. He was detained at Lisbon airport after arriving on a flight from Turkey where he had been refused entry, according to the National Crime Agency. Male, who was added to the NCA’s most-wanted list in January, is accused of conspiracy to supply cocaine and ketamine, money laundering and conspiracy to acquire a firearm as part of his alleged drug-dealing activity between April and June 2020. He had been on the run after failing to adhere to the bail restrictions imposed after his arrest and was previously thought to be in the Marbella area of Spain before moving to Portugal. The NCA international liaison officer, Phil Robinson, said: “Male naively believed he could travel across international borders using fraudulent documentation and remain undetected by law enforcement. But he underestimated the vigilance and expertise of the Turkish border police, which enabled the Portuguese authorities to act. “Any arrest of a fugitive is a fantastic result, even more so since Male had only recently been added to our most-wanted list. “He is wanted in connection with dangerous crimes, which have a devastating impact on communities, so I’m delighted he has been caught. We continue to work with our international partners to close the net around fugitives, no matter where they are.” Male, who was initially detained at Lisbon airport on Saturday, remains in custody and will face extradition proceedings. DI Adrian Hawkins of the south-west regional organised crime unit said: “Male will now be returned to the criminal justice system in the UK to face the charges he ran away from. This is an example of international law enforcement working together to ensure justice can be done and demonstrating there is nowhere safe to hide.” The NCA is the UK’s lead agency against serious and organised crime.",News/UK news,One of UK’s most wanted men arrested at Lisbon airport,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/02/alex-male-arrested-lisbon-one-of-uk-most-wanted-men
5/3/2022,"The problem with Russia suffering “colossal losses” (Moscow confirms attack on Kyiv during UN chief’s visit, 29 April) is that this really does not matter to its leaders. You only have to look back at historic campaigns involving Russia and its satellites to see that one of its major tactics is to keep throwing men (and women) into battle until the other side runs out of steam. A comparison of the allied (British, American and French) cemeteries from the second world war in what was West Berlin and the Soviet war memorial in Treptow Park in the erstwhile East Berlin shows the difference in attitude to the value of human life: on the one hand individual graves lovingly cared for, each with its cross; on the other a vast arena where a statue of a Russian soldier holds aloft a child and stamps on the symbol of Nazism, while looking across to the statue of Mother Russia. Between them lie anonymous sarcophagi, each containing an unnumbered quantity of unnamed bodies. Western rhetoric will not deter Vladimir Putin, who is a past master of the art; our politicians must find an effective brake to his ambitions in order to prevent further aggression from him.Anne MaclennanCuguen, France  I was relieved to read your editorial (29 April) explicitly addressing the risks of escalation of the Ukraine war. I have been alarmed at the increasingly bellicose rhetoric of our government, politicians and commentators in the press, which has drifted towards war between Nato and Russia, without any reflection on the risks raised by a conflict between nuclear powers. As someone who lived through much of the cold war, I am astonished and terrified by the apparent lack of concern over the risks of this crisis; where alarm bells should be ringing loudly, nuclear escalation is hardly referred to, despite nuclear Armageddon being a predictable consequence. Whereas the priority should be seeking a negotiated end to the conflict involving unpalatable compromises, all the rhetoric has been of victory and defeat. Unless this changes, the risks will only steadily increase.Stephen SmithGlasgow  Another brilliant piece by Simon Jenkins (Liz Truss risks recklessly inflaming Ukraine’s war to serve her own ambition, 28 April). With a prime minister who thinks he’s Winston Churchill and a foreign secretary who thinks she’s Margaret Thatcher, we are at risk of bellicose fantasy sliding into bloody reality. Putin is dangerous, but the best response to danger is rationality, not grandiose promises. Putin needs a way out. A joint undertaking by Russia and Nato to guarantee the neutrality of Ukraine (and other nations) should have been on the table to avert the invasion, but it could still be a way of offering Putin a basis for peace. He would no doubt claim it was an achievement of his demonstration of strength, but sustaining sovereignty would be the real benefit. The endgame has to be agreement, not mutually assured destruction.Andrew SeberWinchester  Neal Ascherson’s condemnation of Liz Truss’s dangerous rhetoric is clear and welcome (Letters, 28 April). It is founded on deep understanding of the countries and peoples who live near or around the Black Sea. His call for Truss to be put “back into her cage” should be extended to Boris Johnson and Ben Wallace, who dangerously talk up conflict as a solution and themselves as “leaders”.Darra McFadyenLondon  Many international lawyers argue that Nato is an illegal organisation since it is a political and military alliance, not exclusively focused on peace and security, although it signed up to article 2(4) of the UN charter prohibiting use of force to resolve disputes. Liz Truss ignores its peace role and is promoting the continuance of this horrendous war, rather than seeking ways to end it.Margaret OwenLondon  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

5/3/2022,"In September 1985, a New York Times article bemoaned the decline of the established stars of country music and the cliched “Nashville Sound”, but help was already on the way. Why Not Me, the 1984 debut album by mother and daughter duo the Judds, had topped the US country chart, was racking up multimillion sales, and had delivered three No 1 country singles, Why Not Me, Girls’ Night Out and Love Is Alive. With her daughter Wynonna, Naomi Judd, who has died aged 76 after suffering from depression and mental illness, was about to top the country chart again with the follow-up album, Rockin’ With the Rhythm. It would also generate three more chart-topping singles. To their amazement, the Judds found themselves nominated for best new artist at the 1985 Grammy awards, up against mainstream pop stars such as Cyndi Lauper and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. The Judds were not alone either, because 1986 brought a swathe of debut albums by a posse of artists including Steve Earle, Lyle Lovett and Dwight Yoakam – “New Traditionalists” – who would galvanise a stagnant Nashville. But the Judds’ family bond gave them something special. Naomi and Wynonna had listened to country music’s famous sibling acts, including the Delmore Brothers and the Everly Brothers as well as the swing-era trio the Boswell Sisters and the Andrews Sisters. The Judds’ own voices made a naturally organic mix. Wynonna’s was powerful and bluesy, and mixed with Naomi’s sweeter tone to form an unmistakable and commercially irresistible blend. With songs that melded elements of bluegrass, folk, early rock’n’roll and even a little bebop, and lyrics that often empathised with the lives of small-town, working-class women, the Judds became a natural addition to country’s lineage of forceful female stars such as Tammy Wynette or Patsy Cline. However, their joint career was cut painfully short. In 1990 Naomi announced that she was suffering from hepatitis C, and the Judds gave up performing the following year (though they would reunite for some one-off shows, and mounted the Power to Change tour in 2000 and the Last Encore Tour in 2010-11). They had notched up 14 No 1 singles on the country chart, while their six albums had sold more than 20m copies, making them, at the time, history’s most successful country duo. They won five Grammy awards, nine Country Music Association awards and seven awards from the Academy of Country Music. Naomi was born Diana Judd in Ashland, Kentucky, daughter of Charles Judd, a petrol station owner, and Pauline (nee Oliver), who was a cook on a Mississippi river boat. At the age of three, she was sexually abused by an uncle, an event she believed helped trigger her history of depression. At 17 she became pregnant by Charles Jordan, but he abandoned her, and in January 1964 she married Michael Ciminella. Later that year Wynonna was born, the birth causing Naomi to miss her high school graduation ceremony. In 1965 her younger brother Brian died of Hodgkin’s disease, and her parents split up. Naomi’s second daughter, Ashley, was born in 1968, by which time she and her husband had moved to Los Angeles, where Naomi began studying for a nursing degree. Ashley would become a successful film actor, with roles in Heat, Double Jeopardy and A Time To Kill, among others. Naomi and Ciminella divorced in 1972, and she took a variety of jobs to support her daughters. A traumatic assault and rape by a drug-addicted ex-boyfriend prompted her to leave Los Angeles and move to a cottage in Morrill, Kentucky, where she struggled to pay the bills while Wynonna became absorbed in singing and learning to play the guitar. They moved back to Marin County, California, where Naomi enrolled in nursing school. She was often frustrated by Wynonna’s obsession with music (“she’d even take grocery money to buy new guitar strings,” she recalled), until she discovered that she and her daughter had a natural instinct for singing harmony together. Naomi recalled the influence of the coal-mining songs of Hazel Dickens and Alice Gerrard. “As these women harmonised together, it came to me: Wynonna and I couldn’t talk to each other, but, lo and behold, we could sing together.” After Naomi completed her nursing studies, the family moved to Nashville in 1979. Three years later, Naomi was assigned to nurse the daughter of the record producer Brent Maher after she had been injured in a road accident. A grateful Maher agreed to listen to a demo tape Naomi and Wynonna had recorded, and when he had heard it he instantly agreed to become their producer. He spent six months honing their sound, and in 1983 they were signed to RCA following a live audition. In early 1984 they released the six-track EP Wynonna & Naomi, from which Mama He’s Crazy became their first song to top the country chart. The song also appeared on their debut album later that year. After Naomi gave up performing with the Judds, she founded the Naomi Judd Education and Research Fund to raise awareness about hepatitis C and became an advocate for the American Liver Foundation. She took occasional acting roles, hosted the Sunday morning talk show Naomi’s New Morning in 2005 and joined the reality-competition show Can You Duet as a judge in 2008. She had married Larry Strickland (a former backing singer for Elvis Presley) in 1989, and in 2017 the couple competed in the reality cooking series My Kitchen Rules. She also published a string of books, including River of Time: My Descent Into Depression and How I Emerged With Hope (2016). In a 2017 interview she described how her mental state had declined dramatically after she stopped performing. “When I came off the tour I went into this deep, dark absolutely terrifying hole and I couldn’t get out. I spent two years on my couch.” The Judds had been planning a concert tour for this autumn. She is survived by her husband and daughters.

But the belated recognition of the role of Black women in the arts and as uncompromising “troublemakers” in the UK needs to go back at least a generation. For example, Trinidad-born Pearl Prescod was the first Black female actor at the National Theatre, in Olivier’s production of Arthur Miller’s The Crucible in 1965. In 1963, with Claudia Jones and other Black artists, who, like her, merged the personal, political and professional, she led the anti-racist march to the US embassy in London in solidarity with Martin Luther King’s March on Washington, singing We Shall Overcome.

5/3/2022,"The season that ended early with Carlo Ancelotti becoming the only manager to win all five of Europe’s major leagues started with a phone call about something completely different. If this wasn’t exactly the way they had planned it, that’s because it was better. In late May last year Zinedine Zidane announced he was leaving Real Madrid, dropping a letter bomb as he went, and the sudden search for someone to replace him wasn’t going particularly well. Until one Saturday when, discussing other deals, they told Ancelotti as much, the conversation shifting from players to coaches, an idea forming. What about me? A couple of calls later and it was done. By the Tuesday, Ancelotti had been announced as the new old manager. They briefed him but he didn’t really need them to: it was enough to know that this is Real Madrid. Sure, he had been unhappy about how they had sacked him last time, yes he was aware of the pressure and politics it brings having suffered it himself, but still: it’s Real Madrid, a second chance he never expected. “If it had been anyone else, I would have said ‘no’,” he claimed. Everton weren’t as bothered as they should have been and if some in Madrid weren’t as excited as they should have been either, Madrid had a manager. Twelve months on, they have a league title too, Ancelotti’s first in Spain to go with one at each of Milan, Chelsea, PSG and Bayern. On Wednesday night, they also have a Champions League semi-final second leg, the fans celebrating this success also trying to prepare the ground for that one, chanting “si, se puede!” – yes, we can! And so far the evidence in Europe is that somehow, even if they don’t entirely know how, they can. Domestically, it is easier to understand: while the victory that removed any last doubt they would win the league was another comeback, winning 3-2 at Sevilla having been 2-0 down, in the end Madrid’s title comes down to the most basic thing of all: they’ve been better than everyone else. On Saturday afternoon, they defeated Espanyol 4-0 at the Bernabéu, winning the league in front of their fans for the first time in 15 years. “We did it with four weeks to spare, and that says it all,” insisted Luka Modric. If at times it has been hard to judge how good Madrid are, if Marca’s Rubén Jiménez described this season as a cowboys and Indians film without any Indians, Atletico 25 points off where they finished last year with 12 to play for and Barcelona and Sevilla 13 points off, Madrid haven’t wrapped up a league this early in 32 years. They lead by 15 points, which would equal the biggest ever margin. They have scored more goals, created more chances and completed more passes than anyone. And they have lost just three times, responding to each defeat by going 10 weeks unbeaten: Espanyol in week eight, Getafe in week 19, Barcelona in week 29. That last one hurt. This is a team with flaws but with moments too, players whose highest level is superior, and they tend to step up when it mattered most. “We won in hard places,” Ancelotti said, “Sevilla, San Sebastian, Bilbao, Barcelona.” Away at nine of the top 10 – this week they visit Atlético – they’ve only dropped points in a draw at Villarreal. At the Bernabéu they beat Sevilla, Atlético and Real Sociedad. Madrid have only had two spells off the top – after week two and between weeks 9 and 14 when they had a game in hand – and won’t be off it for the rest of the season now. Which is why they were celebrating on Saturday, the trophy actually handed to them on the day they won the thing, which is progress, Marcelo bowing before Modric, Nacho fetching David Alaba’s chair and taking Sergio Ramos and Raúl’s role of performing bullfighting passes, kids sliding by. Players and staff danced in a huge circle. Fans followed the bus down the Castellana, trophy taped on tight to prevent another tumble, while over 100,000 people waited at Cibeles, the Roman Goddess of fertility. Carlo Ancelotti was thrown into the sky, shouting “More! More!” “I enjoyed being in the air,” he said. Then he thanked Madrid for this opportunity. There was a hint of tears as he talked. “Getting emotional is genetic: my grandfather did it and my father did it too,” he said. And yet while that was understandable, if there’s anything that has defined this title-winning season it is how calm he has been, how in control; how he doesn’t seem to care about any of the crap, barely an eyebrow raised, albeit raised a long way. That has always been the case but this year, at 62, given another go, all the more so. “The work has been easy for me,” he said, and sometimes it feels like it really has been, like he has been able to leave them to get on with it and just enjoy the ride, like this is not about him. Not least because the person who least makes it about Carlo Ancelotti is Carlo Ancelotti. There was a moment earlier this season when Ancelotti said Modric, Toni Kroos and Casemiro do things he hasn’t asked them to do. “Madrid fans can rest easy,” he said, “I’m not going to interfere.” There may be something in that and this has been their league. It has been Karim Benzema’s league, the best player in Spain by a very long way. And it has Thibaut Courtois’s league, saving 75% of shots faced, running at a miracle a match or more. It has certainly been Vinícius’s league, scoring twice as many as in the last three seasons combined, even though it didn’t look likely to begin with. This league has been about them and their teammates, but this is also Ancelotti’s league. When Ancelotti took over, his idea was to play Eden Hazard and Gareth Bale up front but Vinícius took over, his case made and closed swiftly, quietly. Pragmatism without posturing: if it doesn’t work, move on; if it does work, do it, facilitate it. Bale started the first three games and only once thereafter, clocking up more minutes with Wales than Madrid; Hazard has scored no league goals. The most expensive players in Madrid’s history with the highest salaries in the squad, their absence has not mattered. Nor even has the departure of Sergio Ramos and Raphaël Varane, the defence that sustained them over a decade. In part, because Ancelotti didn’t let it. In those early weeks, Dani Carvajal said this Ancelotti was different to the one he had known before in being more focused on the defence. He talked about how he wanted defenders to be pessimists, not optimists – it’s better they fear the worst. He, though, is an optimist with a lightness of touch, managing moments that, in this giant echo chamber, can become bigger than they really are. He knows: when he arrived, he was asked about Zidane’s complaints, the response suggesting his former assistant really should have known where he was. “I’ve been in football almost 40 years and people speak – it’s normal,” he said. There are things you can’t change, so don’t try. He made no demands, no requests for players, no complaints about gaps in the squad or players who didn’t care enough. He started no fires; instead he put them out, every debate gently dismissed, managed like it was the most natural thing in the world. He won the league with a midfield aged, 36, 32 and 30. He didn’t really rotate, 10 of the XI clear (although Kroos and Modric have sat out a significant chunk of games). He ignored warnings about a late season collapse like last time, and they reached the season’s close in better physical shape than anyone expected. “I don’t listen to what’s said; I look at the data we have from games and training,” he said, trusting in fitness trainer Antonio Pintus who rejoined last summer. When it was suggested that they played too deep – the stats reveal a team lining up two and a half metres further back than last season – he said that Vinícius had a “motorbike in his boots” so why wouldn’t you play on the counter? After the PSG game, though, he agreed: they would step up. Athletic Bilbao 2-0 Atlético Madrid, Valencia 1-1 Levante, Real Madrid 4-0 Espanyol, Aláves 2-1 Villarreal, Barcelona 2-1 Real Mallorca, Rayo Vallecano 1-1 Real Sociedad, Granada 1-1 Celta Vigo, Elche 1-1 Osasuna He admitted mistakes, but said: “I can get it wrong once; I tend not to get it wrong twice.” When he was accused of suffering Benzema dependencia, he said he was proud to depend on the world’s best player. When Marco Asensio got angry, he said: “Good.” The next match Asensio scored a hat-trick and he wondered who to annoy next. When Kroos was angry at being replaced, Ancelotti turned to a recurring line he likes: “He got annoyed with the manager, not the man.” He reminded everyone of something a footballer had said to him, his understanding revealed: “The player who’s not pissed off at not playing is not a player at all.” When Dani Ceballos wanted more minutes, he said: “He’s right; I’ve been unfair.” Empathy reached players, who adore him, play for him, won the league with him. One line stands out, even if few seemed to hear it. “I listen to my players,” he said, something so often seen as a weakness instead projected as a what it actually is: a strength. On Saturday night, once the plan had come together and as the open-topped bus edged down the Castellana with the league title on board, past Nuevos Ministerios and the science museum, beyond Colón and on to Cibeles, Carlo Ancelotti pulled on a pair of sunglasses and sucked on a gigantic cigar, the portrait of what he had done and how he had done it. “The Boss,” Vinícius called him.",Sport/Football,Real Madrid step up when it matters to seal Ancelotti’s grand slam of titles | Sid Lowe,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/02/real-madrid-seal-carlo-ancelotti-grand-slam-titles-la-liga
5/3/2022,"Swiss politicians will debate the future of the country’s controversial banking secrecy law this week, as it faces pressure from UN officials to scrap rules under which whistleblowers and journalists who report on potential wrongdoing can be prosecuted. A committee in Switzerland’s parliament could put forward proposals by Friday that would amend the banking secrecy law – known as article 47 – which makes it a criminal offence to disclose information about a bank’s clients, even if it is in the public interest to do so. It comes amid mounting international pressure to repeal the law, including from the United Nations special rapporteur for freedom of opinion and expression, Irene Khan, who said article 47 violated international law and human rights. “This is normally a problem in authoritarian states,” she said. Khan, who has written to the Swiss government on the matter, is planning to escalate her concerns regarding article 47 to the UN’s human rights council next month. Her intervention following an investigation by a consortium of international media outlets, including the Guardian, into Switzerland’s second largest bank, Credit Suisse. The leak, which included data for 30,000 clients, revealed that the bank held accounts for individuals involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption, and other serious crimes, over decades. However, Switzerland’s extreme banking secrecy laws meant that journalists who took part in the investigation, known as the Suisse secrets project, risked potential fines or even imprisonment. Swiss media could not take part as a result. It prompted Khan to write to the Swiss government, demanding they explain how the laws aligned with the country’s commitment to human rights. “The blanket protection of banking secrecy in Switzerland violates international law,” Khan told reporters from Tamedia and Der Spiegel, who were involved in the Suisse secrets project. She said Swiss banking secrecy laws were incompatible with two international conventions – article 19 of the international covenant on civil and political rights, and article 10 of the European convention on human rights – which together guarantee freedom of expression and the press. “Switzerland has signed both and is obliged to uphold them,” she said. Khan added that the Swiss government was “in a difficult position to explain why publishing information that could reveal financial crimes should be punished with up to three years in prison. Especially when journalists and whistleblowers point out real problems in a bank. The law should not criminalise that.” Article 47 has existed since the early 20th century, but was expanded in 2015 to include third parties such as journalists and whistleblowers, after a number of cases where client data was shared with to foreign tax authorities. That famously included a CD of data from HSBC Private Bank Suisse that was subsequently accessed by journalists. Supporters of the law have previously cited clients’ rights to privacy. However, Khan said: “Convicted criminals and politically exposed persons have a right to privacy but not when there is good ground to believe they may be involved in financial wrongdoing.” Credit Suisse said in February that it could not comment on specific clients due to the same banking secrecy laws but “strongly rejects the allegations and inferences about the bank’s purported business practices”. The special rapporteur said the Swiss government had since responded to her letter, first sent in March, claiming it was fully committed to freedom of expression and that no journalist had ever been prosecuted under the law, which they said was now under review. A Swiss government spokesperson said they expected the full response to be published next week. In the meantime, the Swiss parliamentary subcommittee on economy and taxes is to review article 47 and the findings from the Suisse secrets investigation from 5 May. The subcommittee could put forward a motion that could amend the law as early as Friday. But barring a major overhaul, Khan will escalate the issue to the UN human rights council on 24 June. She plans to present officials with a new report on press freedoms that will “critically address” article 47 and the criminalisation of journalism that she says is typically observed in authoritarian regimes. “Switzerland is a champion of human rights and press freedom, and participates actively in the UN human rights council. It has repeatedly denounced the actions of other countries against journalists. That is why it is important that Switzerland now reacts itself and changes such a problematic law. Switzerland must not only preach. It must also act,” she said.",News/News,Swiss consider amending banking secrecy laws amid UN pressure,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/may/02/swiss-consider-amending-banking-secrecy-laws-amid-un-pressure
5/3/2022,"Earlier today I set you this problem from last year’s British Mathematical Olympiad (BMO), the UK’s top maths competition for pre-university students, which is taken by almost 2,000 teenagers a year. The question was attempted by 90 per cent of the contestants, and about 1 in 3 got full marks. How did you get on? Ping pong percentages Arun and Disha played several games of table tennis. At five points during the day, Arun calculated the percentage of the games played so far that he had won. The results of these calculations were exactly 30 per cent, exactly 40 per cent, exactly 50 per cent, exactly 60 per cent and exactly 70 per cent, but not necessarily in that order. What is the smallest possible number of games they played? Here’s a hint. Arun wins one of the first two games. Solution 30 Here’s how you might have gone about it. First, let G be the number of games played so far. If at any stage Arun has won 30 per cent of the games he played, then we can write the equation: W/G = 3/10 where W are the games he has won so far. We can rearrange this equation as 10W = 3G, from which we can deduce that G must be a multiple of 10. However we also know that there is a point at which he has won 70 per cent of games. In other words there is a w such that 10w = 7G. We can eliminate the chance that the total number of games is 10, since if it was then this would mean that after ten games Arun would be finishing having won both 70 and 30 per cent of games, which is impossible. Let’s say the total number of games is 20. Then either (i) after 10 games he has won 3 of them, and after 20 games he has won 14 of them, or (ii) after 10 games he has won 7 of them and after 20 games he has won 6 of them. [This is because we are only going to achieve the 30 per cent, and 70 per cent, of wins when the games played is divisible by 10] Both (i) and (ii) are impossible. (i) because there are not enough games to go from 3 to 14 wins in 10 games, and (ii) because you can’t go from 7 wins to 6. Now let’s try with G = 30. I told you that Arun wins now of the first two games. So, after two games his running total of wins/games is 1/2, which is 50 per cent. Let’s now rewrite the other percentages required as fractions: 30, 40, 60 and 70 per cent are 3/10, 2/5, 3/5 and 7/10. Let’s say that after winning 1/2, Arun wins one of the next three. That get’s him to 2/5, when he will have won 40 per cent. If he wins one of the next five, that get’s him to 3/10, which is 30 per cent. If he wins nine of the next ten, that get’s him to 12/20, which is 60 per cent. If he wins another nine of the next ten, he finishes with 21/30, which is 70 per cent. We’re done! G = 30.

5/3/2022,"Buns N Roses, the cheeky opening number in Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Cinderella, sets the scene in Belleville, imagined by writer Emerald Fennell as an “aggressively picturesque” place whose supremely buffed citizens keep their dirty laundry out of sight. “We’re so dependent on the tourist trade to fill our cupboards and our coffers,” observe the chorus of the town, before the Queen unveils a grand statue. “Should be a luc-ra-tive att-ract-tion” she predicts in a contented staccato. But after a troubled run that included umpteen opening night postponements and a shutdown of several weeks amid the Omicron crisis, Lloyd Webber’s latest attraction is to close early, despite London tourism beginning to bounce back from its 2020-21 lows and the West End’s footfall slowly returning towards pre-pandemic levels. Cinderella had been booking until February next year and the announcement on Sunday night of its closure next month came as a surprise to many of the cast and crew, including several actors who had been about to join the company and who expressed their shock on social media. Among them was Daisy Twells who said she had spent weeks going in and out of London for rounds of auditions, had been trying to find a place to live and had mapped out the next year of her life in what would have been her first West End show. Summer Strallen, who had been due to take over the role of the Queen and went for a wig fitting as recently as last week, said that her diary was also now unexpectedly and alarmingly empty. A spokesperson for Lloyd Webber’s Really Useful Group said that “everyone involved in Cinderella was contacted by call, email or in person (some through agents) before the news went live in the evening” and that “every effort was made to ensure people were notified before it went live”. But for several of the show’s newest recruits, tweets and news stories about the closure reached them before their official notice did. Bear in mind that this was a bank holiday weekend: informing a huge number of workers, simultaneously, of such upsetting news requires great consideration and careful timing – why choose Sunday before a public holiday? The fact that some of the leads were already leaving the show soon does not make the situation any easier for the company. And what a company they are. I was at the Gillian Lynne theatre again on Saturday afternoon to see the show for a second time after it left me giddy on opening night in August. I wondered if it would have the same effect and, if anything, I enjoyed it even more. In the lead role, Carrie Hope Fletcher is a phenomenon (I’d forgotten she has quite so many solos) and Ivano Turco, who only graduated in the summer of 2020, is a fantastic Prince Sebastian, navigating his feelings for his childhood mucker Cinderella as well as his unease with royal duties. Turco’s solo, Only You, Lonely You, is delivered tenderly and the jesting duets he and Fletcher share are a delight. Gloria Onitiri is in such blazing voice as the Godmother that you long for her to have a bigger part. Victoria Hamilton-Barritt – inexplicably the only cast or creative from the show to earn an Olivier nomination – is still a haughty hoot as the Stepmother, while Georgina Castle and Laura Baldwin are a double whammy of wicked vanity as her daughters. They get some of Fennell’s prickliest lines and, in the helter-skelter song Unfair, relish some of David Zippel’s snappiest lyrics too. Throw in Rebecca Trehearn’s Queen, with an incestuous lust for her strapping son Prince Charming, and you think how unfortunate it was that this most panto of musicals was closed for so much of the festive period through concerns about the Omicron variant. The show earned five- and four-star reviews in August and the matinee I saw – alongside several others who had already seen the show once – ended with a standing ovation in the packed stalls. But the booking system shows lots of seats are still empty for the remaining shows. How come? Its stop-start run won’t have helped build an audience and, while many saw the composer as theatrical Marmite already, his declarations last year about risking arrest to open the show at full capacity won’t have endeared him to many. Ticket prices aren’t the key issue: there are two ticket bands under £20 with lots of those seats still left. There are certainly issues of confidence about returning to theatres when the majority of an audience is unmasked; I didn’t see very many masks at Cinderella. Other mega musicals, including Lloyd Webber’s own masked avenger, in The Phantom of the Opera, and hits such as Hamilton, are also showing plenty of available seats this week. So is another fairytale, Frozen, but I wonder if part of the problem with Cinderella is how, unlike that Disney juggernaut, it isn’t targeted squarely at a young audience. Belleville is a barbed, bitchy place with thrusting bare-chested “hunks” bragging about their sexual conquests. You might think twice about taking kids along; equally, an adult audience may well wonder if it’s a family-focused show rather than the filthy, rip-roaring (if occasionally moving) night that it is. This time I sat in the revolve section of the stalls which, in the second half, spins you around during a waltz scene so that you end up underneath the set’s rococo frame, watching the show as if on stage. It’s the sort of coup de théâtre that you’d imagine would have helped to win audiences back when the industry was promoting the unrivalled thrill of live entertainment during the pandemic. Cinderella became a much-publicised flagship show for that task, a brand new musical in the commercial sector which had far less help from the government’s Culture Recovery Fund than subsidised theatres. “We led the charge to reopen the West End,” said Lloyd Webber in his statement about the early closure. But the way that closure was handled suggests the industry has a long way to go if it really wants to “build back better”.

5/3/2022,"A multi-billion dollar cryptocurrency company has apologised to users after its sale of “metaverse land” sparked a frenzy that temporarily brought down the Ethereum cryptocurrency. Yuga Labs, the company behind the Bored Ape NFTs beloved of Jimmy Fallon and Paris Hilton, announced the sale of its latest tokens – representing plots of land in a forthcoming multiplayer game called Otherside – on Sunday. A total of 55,000 plots were sold, at a flat price of 305 ApeCoin (a currency created by Yuga), which is worth about £4,500 at current exchange rates. Demand for the plots was so high that it overwhelmed the Ethereum blockchain, a layer of infrastructure that all cryptocurrency projects rely on to operate. As users raced to be one of the lucky few able to secure an “Otherdeed”, transaction fees on the network rose higher and higher, until an individual NFT purchase cost more than £2,500 in fees alone. One user, who successfully secured two Otherdeeds, paid a transaction fee of over 5 ETH (£11,000) on top of the £9,000 to buy the land itself. Others lost thousands of pounds failing to secure the tokens at all: if a user runs out money while paying the transaction fees, the transaction fails, but the fees aren’t refunded. For most of those who secured Yuga’s latest token, the eye-watering fees have paid off, at least in the short term: tokens that sold for £4,500 are already reselling for more than £9,000. But people who were unlucky enough to be trying to carry out other cryptocurrency business at the same time have racked up hefty losses. Molly White, a cryptocurrency expert who runs a site chronicling the sector, tracked multiple examples over the day of NFT sales worth less than £500 being hit with transaction fees of more than £2,000. $3,300 transaction fee for a $25 NFT(not a typo—they paid a transaction fee that was more than 100x as much as the NFT) pic.twitter.com/mzNGMpAcGa “Gas fees, which increase based on network congestion, spiked to shocking levels,” White wrote. While most sales on OpenSea, the most popular marketplace for NFTs, were for Otherside deeds, “some people oddly continued to buy and sell cheaper NFTs”, she added. In total, more than $100m was spent on transaction fees to buy Otherside NFTs, while Yuga Labs took another $300m in payments. When the sale was over, the company apologised for the chaos it had caused. “We know that the Otherdeed mint was unprecedented in its size as a high-demand NFT collection, and that would bring with it unique challenges. “This has been the largest NFT mint in history by several multiples, and yet the gas used during the mint shows that demand far exceeded anyone’s wildest expectations. The scale of this mint was so large that Etherscan crashed,” Yuga added, referring to a cryptocurrency analytics website. “We’re sorry for turning off the lights on Ethereum for a while.” The company had already faced one crisis thanks to the Otherdeed sale: a fake post on its hacked Instagram page, announcing free metaverse land, led to a phishing campaign that stole $3m worth of NFTs. Some argued that the ramifications of such a comparatively small sale was evidence that the cryptocurrency sector would struggle to scale to provide services to the mainstream. “There’s much talk about the promise of web3. But at this rate, any non-web3 sales mechanism works with ~100x less wasted fees,” wrote Gergely Orosz, a prominent technology commentator. “If it’s too expensive to use, or it’s unreliable: this is something alpha at best, not ready for mainstream use.”",News/Technology,Yuga Labs apologises after sale of virtual land crashes Ethereum,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/02/yuga-labs-apologises-after-sale-of-virtual-land-crashes-ethereum
5/3/2022,"A first group of civilians trapped for weeks inside Mariupol’s Azovstal steelworks were expected to reach a Ukrainian-held city on Monday, but efforts to save more people from the horrific conditions inside the huge plant were held up. Hundreds remain trapped in underground bunkers and tunnels beneath the sprawling industrial site – the last stronghold of resistance to Russia’s siege of the devastated southern port city – which Moscow’s forces resumed shelling overnight. Ukraine’s defence ministry said its drones had destroyed two small Russian Raptor patrol boats in the Black Sea, while the governor of the Russian region of Belgorod reported two explosions in the early hours, the latest in a string of fires and blasts in recent weeks at ammunition stores and fuel depots in the area. A Russian rocket strike hit a strategically important bridge across the Dniester estuary west of the port of Odesa, authorities said, while Moscow claimed to have also destroyed an airport runway and a hangar containing western-supplied weapons and ammunition outside the south-western city. Under Russian control Russian invasion route Russian airstrike or shelling Russian attack or movement Ukrainian attack or movement  The world becomes increasingly concerned about more than 100,000 Russian troops that have accumulated on the Ukrainian border. Western intelligence agencies sound the alarm, though Vladimir Putin insists Russia has no plans to invade. On 22 February, Putin declared that Russia would recognise the Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent states, after Russia-backed separatists partially seized the regions. Ukraine and the west's worst fears are realised as airstrikes hit targets across the country, as far west as Lviv. By clicking on the dots on the map, you'll reveal more information about individual strikes and events. Russian forces invade Ukraine from multiple entry points: Belarus to the north, Russia to the east and Russian-occupied Crimea to the south. Russian forces move on several points on the first day of the invasion. Several key locations, including the Chernobyl exclusion zone, are captured by the Russian army. Russian troops enter parts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where they face strong resistance. After fierce fighting prevents them from seizing the Hostomel airbase on the first day of the invasion, progress is limited to the north-west of the capital. They are still, however, able to claim some land on the outskirts of the city. Elsewhere, fighting continues even as Russian progress slows. Russian forces move to encircle the southern city of Mariupol, although they enjoy less success in the north, where they abandon an attempt to take Chernihiv after heavy fighting. Russian forces advance on key cities including Kharkiv in the north-east, Kyiv in the north and Mariupol in the south. A large convoy of military vehicles approaches the capital, although progress is limited and logistical problems are reported. As the war enters its second week, Russia steps up shelling of civilian areas. Operations to envelop Kyiv remain the focus of Russia’s efforts, but the ISW reports three other aims: seizing Kharkiv, taking Mariupol and securing a “land bridge” in the south, and securing Kherson in order to set conditions for a drive west towards Mykolaiv and Odesa. Little progress is made over the first two weeks of March. Amid reports of lost momentum and low morale, Russian forces are consolidating positions with reinforcements and probing defences around Kyiv. Dozens of civilians are reportedly killed as Russian forces hit cities with artillery and airstrikes, seen as a new tactic in the face of limited advances on the ground. Russia is widely seen as making its best advances in the south, where Kherson becomes the first major city to fall under Russian control. On the other southern front, several buildings in Mariupol are flattened and people are left without water or power. Russia breaks ceasefires put in place to allow for evacuations from Mariupol and Volnovakha. As the conflict concludes its third week, Russia sends in reinforcements to tighten its grip around the key cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, which remain under Ukrainian control. Russian advances in the south contrast with difficulties its forces have faced in the north and north-east. Nowhere is this resistance stronger than in the increasingly fortified capital, Kyiv. Russia steps up its artillery and airstrikes on the city in an apparent attempt to degrade defending forces' capacity and morale. It is a strategy that has so far failed in other cities such as Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. In the months before its invasion Russia deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
5/3/2022,"John Oliver delved into environmental racism in the US, in which, like many things, the effects of toxic pollution disproportionately effect people of color, particularly black Americans. The Last Week Tonight host cited studies which found that black Americans are exposed to 38% more polluted air and are 75% more likely to live in communities that border a plant or factory. Those disparities hold when controlled for income; black Americans making $200,000 annually were exposed to more air pollution than white Americans making $25,000, “proving that yet again, racism is one of the few things in this country more powerful than money,” Oliver noted. “In fact, I believe America’s current top five power rankings go: racism, beef, viral videos of soldiers reuniting with their dogs, DJ Khaled’s PR team and then money.” Oliver explored how this happened, and how pervasive the issue is today, starting with the history of redlining, AKA federal policies which prevented black Americans from obtaining government-backed home loans where white people lived. The areas where they could live were often also zoned for industrial uses, essentially overlaying the maps of communities of color and industrial waste zones. “But history and zoning are only part of the story here, because it also is about who is has the power to push back,” Oliver continued, “and polluters often assume that black communities in particular won’t be able to stop them. “Sometimes, pollution can be invisible. And those that you’d expect to warn you about that can be incredibly slow to do so when it comes to communities of color.” Oliver cited the example of the West Calumet housing complex in East Chicago, Indiana, a federally assisted housing community built on top of a former lead smelter. The lead levels surrounding the complex were dangerously off the charts for years, up to 200 times the emergency levels. “Which just isn’t great when the place that you found it is the ground,” said Oliver, “a place notoriously difficult to avoid unless, that is, you’re willing to spend the rest of your life playing a very high-stakes version of the floor is lava.” Even worse, the government knew the area under and around the housing complex was dangerously toxic for decades before it informed residents. Oliver cited government reports on lead toxicity in the area in 1985, 1998 and 2009, when the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) declared West Calumet a Superfund site and prioritized it for cleanup and still didn’t notify residents because federal law doesn’t require its agencies to tell tenants that a unit is located on a Superfund site. “Which I truly cannot wrap my head around,” said Oliver. “The whole point of Superfund is to officially classify something in the government record as very dangerous,” he added. “So it is not great to do that and then not tell the people actually at risk. It’s like putting a ‘Do Not Lean Over the Fence’ sign at a bear exhibit and having it face the bear side. Sure, the information is technically out there, but it’s not really doing much to improve public safety.” The government finally notified residents in 2016 – 31 years and eight government agencies later. “And even then, the steps the government took were utterly pathetic,” Oliver said, including yard signs warning children not to play in the dirt or grass. “We all know there is nothing children respect more than the authority of a flimsy sign,” he deadpanned. The West Calumet example is extreme but telling, as 70% of hazardous waste sites on the Superfund list are located within one mile of federally assisted housing. And “without significant changes, our whole system is currently set up so that places that have already been polluted get worse and worse”. Those areas are literally termed environmental “sacrifice zones”, such as Louisiana’s Cancer Alley, where the cancer risk is more than 50 times the national average. “When you put all of this together – a history of racist zoning, ineffective regulation and a government that continues to prioritize the profits of industry over the health of people – it is clear we have a massive problem,” Oliver said. The Biden administration has named environmental racism as a priority, but also said race will not be a factor in deciding where to focus efforts. “Which is pretty fucking infuriating,” said Oliver. The conservative-majority supreme court is likely to strike down an explicitly race-based policy, which leaves the US “in a pretty fucking backwards situation. When any solutions to this problem have to be race-blind, despite the fact that the causes of it are so demonstrably not.” Oliver called for more support for local activists and intense zoning reform for an “unacceptable” status quo. “When this country designates communities of color as ‘sacrifice zones’ the clear message there is that the people who live in them are expendable,” he said. “That it’s OK for their kids to not be able to play outside and for their lifespans to be shorter. “And unless we take big steps to address environmental racism and call it what it is, a brutal divide is going to stay in place in this country where some are treated like they’re worth protecting, and others like they can be sacrificed.",Arts/Television & radio,John Oliver on environmental racism: ‘It’s clear we have a massive problem’,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/02/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-recap-environmental-racism
5/3/2022,"More than two months after they were unveiled, the government’s student loan changes have now been reviewed and analysed in detail, with experts concluding they will be a gamechanger for higher education in England – but not in the way ministers hope. The long-awaited response to the Augar review of post-18 education and funding, published in February, included 40-year payback periods and higher repayment terms. While these are unlikely to stop middle-class teenagers from aiming for a degree, those from less advantaged backgrounds may hold back, imperilling the supply of graduates in key sectors such as teaching and nursing, experts have concluded. Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) thinktank found that lower-middle- and middle-income graduates would be hardest hit, paying £30,000 more than current graduates, with repayments spread over 40 years. But graduates in the highest income brackets will pay £20,000 less as the progressive elements of the existing loan package are stripped away. The IFS also found that proposals under consideration to restrict loans to those with minimum exam grades could have a dramatic effect on who goes to university. Imposing a requirement of GCSE passes in English and maths might have stopped 10% of recent undergraduates accessing loans – in effect barring most of them from campus. The IFS found the majority would be from disadvantaged families or ethnic minorities, precisely the groups that successive governments have encouraged to consider higher education. Claire Crawford, of University College London’s Institute of Education, said government and taxpayers would be “massively reducing the amount of investment that they are providing” by recouping more from graduates. The proportion of graduates repaying their loans in full could rise from 25% to nearly 75%, according to the IFS. But whether the new repayment regime will deter future students in England depends on their calculations of whether or not they will be better off. “Those who might expect to go on and be relatively high-earning, you would think that they would be even more incentivised to go to university as a result of this, because their repayments are predicted to go down,” Crawford said. “If you’re at the lower end of the spectrum, I guess it’s a more marginal decision. But it’s not totally obvious.” Crawford noted that many students chose subjects and courses that had a low return in terms of earnings, suggesting reasons other than income were behind their decision. “What we can conclude is that the [existing] sticker price did not seem to put people off. So whether they’re paying sufficient attention to these kind of underlying changes, which affect future payments, is not clear,” she said. The vice-chancellor of Sheffield Hallam University, Chris Husbands, said there were two views among his colleagues about the potential effects. “The first view is that none of this is going to have any impact, that the cultural predisposition to go to university as a way of improving yourself is so deeply entrenched, that the changes to the loan regime will not significantly impact the demand for places. “View No 2 is that this cultural predisposition is much stronger among the middle classes than among poorer households, and that while none of these interventions are likely to be decisive in themselves, the drip, drip, drip of this is likely to have an effect on families in places like east Barnsley [reinforcing historically low rates of participation].” Husbands thinks ministers are less interested in widening participation “because they think the job has been done” and are more concerned about cost, with current forecasts of a 26% increase in student numbers over the next decade. As a result Husbands says policymakers are like hotel guests in an unfamiliar shower, alternating between being too hot and too cold while nervously adjusting the taps. “What worries me about all of this is that the deteriorating terms of trade on student loans, the minimum eligibility requirements and so on, are a whole series of interventions that have the impact of getting us back to a 1940s or 1950s world, where essentially universities are full of middle-class people, and poorer people don’t get in,” he said. Husbands said he could accept the case for minimum eligibility requirements, but they could act as barriers to the most disadvantaged because of England’s highly unequal results at school level. “But I don’t think the sector has got its brain around it yet.” While the government has been improving its financial position, it has done little to help students whose maintenance loans are falling in real terms. University funding through tuition fees, stuck at £9,250 since 2016, has also been eroded by inflation despite government increasing teaching grants in some high-priority subjects such as health. Robin Mason, the pro-vice-chancellor at the University of Birmingham, said the extended fee freeze could lead to a rebalancing between more selective universities and the rest of the sector, reversing the trend of the last decade that has resulted in selective universities taking a greater proportion of students. “I think you can bet on the more selective universities not looking to expand their domestic undergraduate numbers,” Mason said. “One part of government policy restricts supply at the top end and another part says it doesn’t want ‘lower-value’ courses. And there’s going to be a collision between those two but it’s a collision that’s being forced by different arms of policy.” A spokesperson for the Russell Group of universities said frozen fees, rising costs and demand for places would “inevitably start to impact on quality and choice for students, particularly for those subjects with the highest teaching costs” such as nursing and engineering. “To protect the pipeline of high-level skills and jobs that will be crucial to our economic recovery, we would urge government to work with the sector and find a long-term, financially sustainable approach to funding higher education and which continues to widen access to university,” the spokesperson said.",News/Education,Student loan changes in England ‘could imperil supply of teachers and nurses’,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/02/student-loan-changes-england-imperil-supply-teachers-nurses
5/3/2022,"The slip-ups and car-crash interviews of Nadine Dorries, the secretary of state for culture, such as her reference to “downstreaming” films, provide regular fodder for satirists and social media users alike, but the problem is that these clips are distractions from the real substance of what she is doing – and the privatisation of Channel 4 is no joke. Privatisation in some form has been mooted about half a dozen times since the channel’s launch in 1982, but no one has managed to get as close as this government, which is pressing ahead with its sale. There are doubts over whether it will have the political backing to pass the legislation required to sell off the broadcaster, but Dorries is defending the plans, not by the brilliance of her argument, but by being less than entirely clear about the facts. Channel 4, which celebrates its 40th birthday this year, is a strange beast: a state-owned broadcaster funded by private-sector advertising, but with a commitment, or remit, to show the sort of public-service content (the news, the Paralympics, regional voices) that is largely unprofitable and then to reinvest profits into new programming. On the day the white paper to privatise the channel was published, listeners to Iain Dale’s LBC radio show heard Dorries say that investment in the broadcasting rival Channel 5 increased after it was “privatised … three years ago, five years ago maybe”. Channel 5 has never been publicly owned and therefore could never have been privatised. When the error was pointed out, Dorries doubled down. She said criticism was “nit-picking” after she “misspoke” the date, suggesting that failing to remember when Channel 5 was sold (2014) was the problem and not the fact she had failed to understand the channel’s ownership model. Everyone is allowed to make mistakes, but the interview was hardly unusual. She wrote a column for the Mail on Sunday headlined, “Predictably, the Leftie lynch mob refuses to accept what is best for British TV”. In it Dorries trumpets the fact that “Channel 4 decreased the amount it spent on new content by £158m” but downplayed the fact that this decline happened in 2020, an exceptional year for everyone, and that the broadcaster’s spending has been back above 2019 levels ever since. Dorries opines that Margaret Thatcher wanted to privatise the channel, citing the former prime minister’s 1988 memoir, yet she fails to mention the fact that subsequent meetings dissuaded Thatcher from this view. This was partly economic – with no in-house production, Channel 4 has pump-primed a thriving independent production sector in the UK since the 1980s – but Thatcher was also convinced that the bill was likely to be defeated. Minutes held in the National Archives read: “In both Houses, a proposal to privatise Channel 4 was likely to be vulnerable to defeat.” Dorries likes to suggest that media luvvies are the ones criticising her plans, yet 96% of the responses to the government’s own consultation paper were against privatisation. Dorries called this “politically motivated organisation” by polling group 38 Degrees, which doesn’t explain why many members of her own party, including Julian Knight, Jeremy Hunt and Damian Green, are against the plans. So why would the government want to push this privatisation now? It can’t be just because it needs the sale proceeds, because Dorries has promised to reinvest them. Dorries denies that her motivations are political – yet she still derides the Channel 4 “anchor … shouting eff the Tories” at every opportunity. It’s hard not to believe that Boris Johnson and his team are turning the heat up on Channel 4 in revenge for its political coverage, including replacing him with a melting ice sculpture when he failed to turn up for a climate crisis debate. The public needs to remember that it can oust the prime minister at the next election, but once Channel 4 is gone, it won’t come back.

5/3/2022,"The US government’s highest-ranking trans official has condemned political attacks on LGBTQ+ communities and accentuated the importance of gender-affirming care for trans youth. Speaking on Saturday in Fort Worth, Texas, the US assistant secretary of health Rachel Levine addressed fellow physicians about conservative politicians’ attacks on LGBTQ+ communities. “Today, many of our fellow human beings across the country call for our attention because they’re being attacked, and they see few places to turn,” Levine said. “I want to say this very, very clearly: lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer Americans are committing suicide at a rate that should shock our conscience.” Levine, a trained pediatrician who specialized in adolescent medicine at Penn State University, said 52% of trans and non-binary young people contemplated suicide in 2020, elaborating on the mental health crisis occurring among LGBTQ+ youth. “Think about how many of them thought it was better to die than to put up with any more harassment, scapegoating and intentional abuse,” Levine added. Levine also said that for many LGBTQ+ young people struggling with poor mental health, a “single caring adult” is “the difference between life and death”. During the speech, Levine underscored the importance of gender-affirming care for trans youth, a healthcare measure that Republicans have worked to deny trans young people in recent months. “Gender-affirming care is medical care,” Levine said. “It is mental health care. It is suicide prevention care. It improves quality of life, and it saves lives.” According to studies Levine cited in her speech, recipients of gender-affirming care, including puberty blockers and hormones, had much lower rates of depression and suicide. “The positive value of gender-affirming care is not in serious scientific or medical dispute,” Levine said. Levine delivered her remarks as several states pass or propose laws prosecuting trans youth and their caretakers. Specifically in Texas, the Republican governor, Greg Abbott, accused parents who provide their children with gender-affirming care of “abuse”, instructing the state’s child protection services in March to investigate any such case. Alabama state lawmakers last month criminalized gender-affirming medical treatments for transgender people 18 or younger, threatening medical providers and parents with prison time and fines. The US justice department has joined efforts to strike that law down as discriminatory and unconstitutional. Iowa also passed a law in March that bans trans girls and women from participating in high school and college athletics, despite arguments that the bill was discriminatory, too, and addressed a manufactured problem. Levine said it was imperative to oppose those who invoke science and the principles of child protection to justify anti-LGBTQ+ legislation. “The language of medicine and science is being used to drive people to suicide,” Levine said. “The mantle of concern for children is being claimed to destroy children’s lives. “We have to stand up. We have to take a stand on behalf of those who are being hurt. We have to be doctors. This is what we do, even when it’s difficult.”",News/US news,America’s top-ranked trans official condemns attacks on LGBTQ+ youth,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/02/rachel-levine-trans-official-lgbtq-attacks
5/3/2022,"A first group of civilians trapped for weeks inside Mariupol’s Azovstal steelworks were expected to reach a Ukrainian-held city on Monday, but efforts to save more people from the horrific conditions inside the huge plant were held up. Hundreds remain trapped in underground bunkers and tunnels beneath the sprawling industrial site – the last stronghold of resistance to Russia’s siege of the devastated southern port city – which Moscow’s forces resumed shelling overnight. “The situation has become a sign of a real humanitarian catastrophe,” Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said, with supplies of water, food and medicine fast running out. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said about 100 civilians should arrive in the city of Zaporizhzhia on Monday. “For the first time in all the days of the war, this vitally needed green corridor has started working,” Zelenskiy said overnight. Some evacuees were initially taken to a village held by Moscow-backed separatists, but later allowed to continue to Ukrainian-held territory if they wanted. However, while the head of the Donetsk military administration said more evacuations under a UN/Red Cross plan were set to begin on Monday morning, by late afternoon the buses had not reached the agreed pickup point. The reason for the holdup was not immediately clear. One evacuee, Natalia Usmanova, 37, said after leaving the steelworks that she became hysterical whenever the bunker started to shake. “I was so worried it would cave in – I had terrible fear,” she told Reuters, recalling widespread terror and a lack of oxygen underground. Some who were not sheltering in the steelworks also managed to escape without assistance. Anastasiia Dembytska said she took advantage of the brief evacuation ceasefire to leave with her daughter, nephew and dog. She said she had to cross countless checkpoints to reach Zaporizhzhia, waiting 18 hours outside before being allowed to pass. Another woman arrived in a funeral van saying she left Mariupol earlier and had been hiding in a basement in a nearby village. A UN spokesperson, Saviano Abreu, said civilians arriving in Zaporizhzhia, about 140 miles (230km) north-west of Mariupol, would get immediate support, including psychological services. A Médecins Sans Frontières team was already in place. There were no apparent plans to pull out the remaining Ukrainian forces still holed up in the plant, however, thought to number up to 2,000 and include members of the Azov regiment, the national guard, marines, border guards and other units. One of the steelworks’ defenders, Denys Shlega, commander of the 12th Operational Brigade of Ukraine’s national guard, said Russian forces resumed shelling the plant on Sunday evening as soon as the civilians were evacuated. Shlega said several hundred civilians remained trapped alongside nearly 500 wounded soldiers and “numerous” dead bodies. “Several dozen small children are still in the bunkers underneath the plant,” he said. Sviatoslav Palamar of the Azov regiment called for wounded fighters to be evacuated too. Mariupol, which is almost entirely held by Russian forces, is a key target because its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, open up a land corridor to Crimea, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops for what has become the main focus of the invasion: achieving full control of the eastern Donbas region. Ukraine said on Monday it had formally closed the Black and Azov sea ports of Kherson, Mariupol, Berdiansk and Skadovsk, all of which have been captured by Russian forces. The World Food Programme said about 4.5m tonnes of grain was stuck in Ukrainian ports. Ukraine’s military command said on Monday Russia had redeployed several battalions from Mariupol to the heavily bombarded town of Popasna in the Luhansk province of Donbas, with the towns of Rubizhne, Sievierodonetsk, Slovyansk and Barvinkove also coming under heavy attack. “I don’t even want to speak about what’s happening to the people living in Popasna, Rubizhne and Novotoshkivske right now,” said the Luhansk regional governor, Serhiy Gaidai. “These cities simply don’t exist any more. They have completely destroyed them.” Zelenskiy’s office said on Monday at least three people were killed and another three, including a child, were wounded in Luhansk over the last 24 hours, with another four wounded in shelling in neighbouring Donetsk. Another two died in Orikhiv in the Zaporizhzhia region, further west. Western officials say Russia is advancing slowly in its eastern offensive and has captured some villages, but is inflicting heavy civilian casualties through indiscriminate bombing. Ukrainian forces are fighting village-by-village and have retaken ground in places. “Everyone understands that we must hold the line here,” Lt Yevgen Samoylov of the 81st Brigade told Agence France-Presse as his unit rotated out of the frontline near the town of Sviatohirsk. “We cannot let the enemy move closer. We try to hold it with all our force.” The UK defence ministry said more than a quarter of the 120 “battalion tactical groups” – about 65% of Moscow’s total combat strength – deployed in Ukraine may be “combat ineffective” due to personnel and equipment losses. “It will probably take years for Russia to reconstitute these forces,” it said. Ukraine’s defence ministry said its drones had destroyed two small Russian Raptor patrol boats in the Black Sea, while the governor of the Russian region of Belgorod reported two explosions in the early hours, the latest in a string of fires and blasts in recent weeks at ammunition stores and fuel depots in the area. A Russian rocket strike hit a strategically important bridge across the Dniester estuary west of the port of Odesa, authorities said, while Moscow claimed to have also destroyed an airport runway and a hangar containing western-supplied weapons and ammunition outside the south-western city. The UN human rights office said the death toll of civilians killed in Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February had reached 3,153, although it said the real toll was likely to be considerably higher. Most victims were killed by explosive weapons, it said.",News/World news,Civilians evacuated from Mariupol steelworks but hundreds still trapped,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/02/mariupol-steelworks-evacuees-heading-ukraine-held-city
5/3/2022,"For more than two months, Vladimir Putin has been violently trying to erase the modern Ukrainian state from the map of Europe. This means Ukraine needs to win. In fact, victory is imperative if the continent wants to stand the chance of being able to live in peace and work collectively to meet global challenges. It is clear that Putin has failed to compel Kyiv to capitulate. Russia’s plans to annihilate Ukraine and annex more of its territory have cemented Ukraine’s will to fight and win this war. So we need to ask: what does victory actually look like? For Ukraine’s government, it means first that the Russian army is defeated on the battlefields of Donbas and is pushed back to where it was stationed before 24 February 2022. Polling, meanwhile, indicates consensus among the people regarding the return of Crimea and Donbas to the control of Kyiv and opposition to a truce with Russia until it fully withdraws its troops. What is needed is the creation of an effective diplomatic forum to negotiate further Russian withdrawal from the occupied parts of Donbas, a settlement over the future of Crimea, financial compensation for the damage it has inflicted, prosecution of individuals who have committed war crimes (Ukraine’s prosecutor general has already registered more than 8,000 suspected cases), the prospect of EU membership for Ukraine, and the creation of viable Nato-compatible armed forces that can defend the country in a coalition of willing nations. What would defeat look like? Put simply, anything that results in a long-term simmering conflict that locks Ukraine in a grey zone of instability. An inconclusive outcome that still gives Russia an upper hand to conquer and annex more territory is unacceptable. The Kremlin is planning a new annexation of the Kherson region under the name of North Tavriya. Kyiv’s official recognition of Putin’s territorial gains at gunpoint would lead to Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s political demise and further endanger the Ukrainian state. Victory won’t be easy, but Ukrainians increasingly believe they can achieve it. That confidence, which seemed like lunacy at the start of the war, has been vindicated by combat success and the total mobilisation of Ukrainian society. This has convinced key western allies that “Ukraine can win”. The UK’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, resolutely stated that “we will keep going further and faster to push Russia out of the whole of Ukraine”. Ukraine’s objectives coincide with those of its allies. More to the point, those goals are now backed by a newly approved Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act under which the US government will allocate $33bn, mostly for military support. A coalition of 40 countries has set up a permanent defence advisory group to coordinate this assistance. Ukraine must defeat Russia in what, after all, should be considered a colonial war. The restoration of Ukrainian territorial integrity and, ultimately, peace will mean the collapse of Putinism as a doctrine and an end to Russian claims to territorial dominance elsewhere in eastern Europe and Central Asia. Demonstrating that a “gathering of historic Russian lands” is doomed to failure is the only solid basis for sustainable peace and security in Europe. Ukraine’s victory would also prevent future wars. Russia uses newly conquered territories to stage further conflicts. Annexed Crimea was indispensable for its military operation in Syria, and now for its assaults on Mariupol and Kherson. The breakaway entity of Transnistria in Moldova, propped up for decades by Russia, is a de-facto arms depot, with a military base that could be used to attack Odesa. Belarus is already being used to launch missiles on Kyiv. Let’s not forget we’re also talking about the world’s food system. A Ukrainian victory would reduce the risk of a mass famine. The lifting of sanctions in response to a full Russian withdrawal from Ukraine would also lead to a more stable and predictable Russian economy. Ukraine and Russia are critical suppliers of food across much of the global south. In some countries, such as Somalia, Russia and Ukraine account for 100% of wheat imports. The UN projects that 8-20 million people will now be left hungry from the knock-on effects of soaring prices and broken supply chains for grain, cooking oil, fertiliser and fuel. Settling this war in a sustainable way means millions of Ukrainians will be able to return home, lifting the burden of caring from countries that host them. More than 5 million people are scattered across European cities and the bill for supporting them is €17bn. Most are desperate to return home. And Ukraine needs these people for its future modernisation and economic growth. The outcome of this war will either lead to a brighter future or bog down millions of people in struggle and misery – and not only in Ukraine. That is why we must give Ukraine’s victory a fighting chance.

5/3/2022,"The paper wine bottle is one of the biggest ideas since the screw top but as pecorino in a brown paper eco-bottle arrives at Ocado, there’s one thing to remember, try not to get it wet. The £11 white, from the sustainable wine brand When in Rome, goes on sale this week, and is the first wine in a paper bottle to be sold in a mainstream UK supermarket. Even if the bottle does become damp, all is not lost, says Rob Malin, the company’s founder, because the wine is safe in a recyclable plastic pouch inside. While glass bottles have been part of the wine-drinking tradition for centuries, making the material requires huge amounts of energy at a time when companies are looking for ways to reduce the carbon footprint of their products. Recycling rates for glass are also poor. “Great wine doesn’t have to come in glass bottles,” Malin says, explaining the leap of faith he is asking wine drinkers to take. “Whether you’re drinking from a glass bottle or a paper bottle, the quality of the wine is not impacted.” However, he cautions, don’t put the paper bottle in an ice bucket. “It will go soggy. You need to use a dry chiller.” The bottle, made by the sustainable packaging firm Frugalpac, is 94% recycled paper and has a carbon footprint that is about a sixth of a single-use glass bottle. At the moment it costs about the same as a glass one but the maths are moving in its favour because of soaring glass prices as well as shortages linked to higher energy costs and the war in Ukraine, where some factories have closed. “The production of glass involves huge amounts of energy, so the cost of glass bottles is going sky-high,” said Malcolm Waugh, Frugalpac’s chief executive. “In some instances it is two to three times the price but it depends on who you are, and the type of bottle. Certainly there’s a 30 to 40% increase.” Waugh says Frugalpac’s sales are up fivefold this year, with the firm being inundated with inquiries for the paper bottles, which can also be used for spirits and olive oil. “We’ve taken some big orders that will be coming out later this year.” Ceri Parke, a co-owner of the Cantina Goccia winery in Umbria, agrees there is a shortage of glass and the price is going up. Her winery uses glass and paper bottles but she says: “You can’t just get the glass bottles you’re used to getting. For a bottling we did three weeks ago, I had to use a bottle that I wouldn’t normally use. The consumer probably won’t notice the difference but the other one is not available.” When in Rome is also trying to convince Britons to try other, greener wine containers such as box wine or cans. These “alt-formats” unfairly get a “bad rap”, Malin says. “People think bag-in-box wine is crap. It’s ridiculous because most Australian wine comes here in huge bag-in-boxes.” The paper bottle has a higher carbon footprint than its box wine but Malin says it means it can go “head to head with glass, and let the consumer decide for themselves about alt-format wines”.",News/Business,Glass dismissed: wine goes green with paper bottle drive,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/02/glass-dismissed-wine-goes-green-with-paper-bottle-drive-ocado
5/3/2022,"The way we talk about the great migration is often oversimplified, limiting it to the movement of Black Americans from the rural south to the urban north through the early and mid 20th century. But there are many more stories of the great migration than just this one. The new joint exhibition between the Mississippi Museum of Art and the Baltimore Museum of Art, A Movement in Every Direction seeks to complicate that tidy narrative through freshly commissioned artwork that adds new stories to the great migration, and explores how it continues to this day. Ryan Dennis, co-curator of the exhibit and Chief Curator of the Mississippi Museum of Art, told me that, “our vision for the show was to think more expansively about the great migration and to its deep connections to the south”. Revising predominating narratives of this massive exodus, Dennis believed that “it was really important to move away from the deep trauma connected to the great migration and to think more about how self-determined agency and possibility were a part of the story”. To that end, A Movement in Every Direction shows new work in various media by 12 celebrated artists, including Carrie Mae Weems, Mark Bradford and Theaster Gates Jr. The show opened at the Mississippi Museum of Art in April, and in the fall it will travel to the Baltimore Museum of Art, opening there on 30 October 2022. Bradford’s attention-grabbing piece 500 consists of 60 individually painted and oxidized paper-on-wood panels. From afar, 500 looks to be an abstract mass of blacks and ochers, but closer examination reveals that each of its 60 panels is in fact a reproduction of a 1913 advertisement reading “WANTED” across the top, recruiting settlers to the Black-established farming town of Blackdom, New Mexico. Incorporated in 1903 by 13 African Americans, the town briefly flourished during the 1910s, before eventually declining and emptying out amid the Great Depression. Bradford’s 500 has a rustic, time-ravaged feel, the process of oxidation rendering each individual panel only partially legible. It conjures curiosity about the individuals who may have seen this advertisement, the mixture of emotions they felt as they contemplated transforming their lives entirely through the arduous work of traveling out west and building a new settlement. A sense of time and history also sits layered on to this work, the panels connoting the gulf of a century that separates us from those migrants, even as it raises contemporary questions about who the descendants of these individuals are and where they are living their lives, probably in drastically different circumstances than their ancestors. Contrasting with the deeply rooted historicism of 500 is artist Leslie Hewitt’s tryptich of abstract low-rise sculptures, Untitled (Slow Drag, Barely Moving, Imperceptible), placed throughout the exhibit. The title of these pieces brings to mind the very slow, lengthy rhythms associated with long-term migrations, particularly in the era before modern means of transportation. Their strangeness can evoke displacement among museum-goers, yet they also offer viewers a moment of familiarity – as the exhibition co-curator and curator at the Baltimore Museum of Art, Jessica Bell Brown, told me, “Leslie uses materials that connect her to her family’s ancestral origin in Macon, Georgia. So the materials create this sort of abstraction for visitors, but when you look at the work it immediately reminds you of this domestic space, a deep sense of connection to space.” Brown saw Hewitt’s sculptures as connecting with Zoë Charlton’s large-scale pop-up collage, Permanent Change of Station, which features an enormous wall drawing of a lush landscape behind multiple pop-up-book-like plants collaged together in the foreground. Although the work leans heavily into the natural splendor that is so essential in defining places, its title calls back to the influence of the military in her family’s life, which caused Charlton’s family to migrate throughout the globe. Brown told me that, “in this piece, Zoë is thinking about her family’s origins in the Florida panhandle, as well as so-called foreign landscapes where her family spent so much time in military service. Looking at Zoë’s incredible installation, it’s phenomenal to me that artists like her and Leslie are speaking to each other through their family stories.” With the breadth of work on offer in A Movement in Every Direction, it is clear that Dennis and Brown are trying to position the great migration in a very broad sense, as a complicated phenomenon that can hold many meanings at once. This show is important in that it aspires to put agency back into the story of the great migration, as well as engage with the larger story of how Black individuals have found their homes in the US. Dennis sees migration as “movement and possibility, something that has a really deep impact on Black folks, both in this country and globally. It looks into how people need to move about to protect themselves and allow for a deeper rootedness in the world, and to think about how they need to move for their families.” Brown added that, “when I think about all the artists in the show, I think about migration as a sense of radical possibility”. Curating A Movement in Every Direction has also been a very personally rewarding experience for Dennis and Brown. Dennis shared that by collaborating on the show they have “created a friendship that will last a lifetime”. In addition, as Black women with their own connections to the Black community, they found that working on the show gave them space to open up questions of their own personal and family histories. Dennis told me that curating the show, “allowed me to ask more questions of my family and to understand their origin story and movement in a way that I just hadn’t before. It’s been inspiring to really just share this exhibition with my nieces and nephews, who have been encouraged to talk to their great-aunts about just their lives.” Adding to that, Brown said, “there’s a deep deep relevance in this exhibition in that it opens up the opportunity for so many folks to open up their family legacies and to open up how they tell stories”. Indeed, so far A Movement in Every Direction has been doing just that. According to Dennis, in the two years that she’s worked with the Mississippi Museum of Art, she’s never seen so many people of color come in to see an exhibit. That’s particularly important since Jackson, where the museum is located, is 85% Black. For Dennis, seeing the public’s response to the show has “been really phenomenal. People in Jackson can see themselves reflected in the work and the narrative of the show, and so they have really showed up.” A Movement in Every Direction is now on at the Mississippi Museum of Art before moving to the Baltimore Museum of Art on 30 October",Arts/Art and design,‘A sense of radical possibility’: re-examining the great migration through art,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/02/re-examining-us-great-migration-through-art
5/3/2022,"Some in the music industry were unsurprised when the allegations about the DJ Tim Westwood came to light last week. There had long been stories recounted by Black women of his alleged abuse of power – rumours that circulated among friends in Black nightlife and the music industry. An investigation by the BBC and the Guardian details the accounts of multiple Black women, some teenagers at the time – of alleged predatory behaviour and groping on the part of the veteran DJ. Some claim to have been groped at his shows, while others maintain that they were enticed to a flat on the promise of professional guidance, only to be abused. In 2020, a Twitter account was created, named Surviving Tim Westwood and a hashtag of the same name started to trend. Then the account disappeared, perhaps due to Westwood’s legal team, as he has denied all the allegations. However it was also possibly indicative of a deep-seated truth: that Black women’s voices are often silenced. This is just one example of how misogynoir, the term used to describe misogyny specifically directed at Black women, may have aided and abetted Westwood in avoiding accountability until now.Westwood was a deified figure within Black music – beloved by party-goers as well as industry gatekeepers. Many people, especially Black men, credit him with giving hip-hop and rap music that would otherwise have been relegated to the underground a mainstream platform. What is telling about that argument is how Westwood’s negligible influence in a culture that is far bigger than him is treated as more important than the allegations made by Black women. So, while the powerful, predominantly white, industry executives who continued to employ him as those allegations swirled should be held accountable, there is clearly an intraracial gender issue here, too – namely that Black women’s stories were diminished in order to justify Westwood’s standing in Black culture overall. Colourism plays a part too. Beauty standards exalt lily-white or racially ambiguous women – so it may well have seemed impossible to many that a powerful man such as Westwood could desire these dark-skinned women. Perhaps it was the presumed undesirability of dark-skinned women that allowed him to allegedly pursue them in a covert manner, without alarm bells ringing. Meanwhile, the fetishisation and hypersexualisation of Black women flourished on his shows – as it does elsewhere in a culture in which the mere expression of our sexuality is seen as an invitation. In 2016, Cardi B was a guest on his YouTube channel, TimWestoodTV. When she asked “do you have sex with a lot of Black women?” he responded “not as much as I’d like to … but we could rectify that”. While #MeToo and #Time’sUp felt like moments of real accountability for lecherous men, the movements felt whitewashed. Meanwhile Tarana Burke’s decades-long work with survivors of sexual abuse, during which she originated the phrase Me Too, went uncredited. It’s difficult to tell whether there has been substantial change within the music industry. Despite confidential conversations among ourselves, women are still reluctant to speak out about the sexual inappropriateness they’ve faced, not only for fear of not being believed, but for their jobs. On the rare occasions that they do report their accounts, non-disclosure agreements can further silence them. This is what makes the recorded testimonies of these Black women so profound; the hope is that they will break through the wall of silence that protects alleged abusers within the music industry. The limitations that #MeToo exposed potentially led to a better understanding of the complexity of issues that affect Black women – and it certainly feels as if there are more light-skinned and white people who want to be better allies. But it is imperative that women of all races and shades band together because the hypervisibility of dark-skinned Black women, of whom there are so few in public life, leaves them particularly exposed to racism and misogyny. Black musicians are beginning to find their voice in tackling this. Recently the singer Ari Lennox was asked “is someone fucking you good right now?” by a South African radio broadcaster. She visibly recoiled and asked: “Why ask it in that way?” In the past, a Black woman might have felt the need to parry this kind of question the way Cardi B did with Westwood, but, by reacting in the way that she did, Lennox was able to set an example that our boundaries are to be respected. Malcolm X once said: “The most disrespected woman in America is the Black woman.” This is still applicable now, and beyond America. It’s promising that Westwood has stepped down from his slot at Capital Xtra until further notice, but there is still a long way to go. By “protect Black women”, we mean protect us all – not just the ones we’re taught to believe are deserving.

5/3/2022,"It has been four weeks since 12-year-old Diana Demchyna was taken in darkness across the Ukrainian border to Poland on the first leg of her journey to Britain. Her parents, who cannot leave Ukraine due to their work, had arranged for Diana to live with her relative, Olenka Pevny, in the UK until the war was over. Pevny, a professor at the University of Cambridge, was assured twice by the Home Office that Diana would be able to come to Britain under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. She filed the paperwork on 24 March and flew to Poland the following week to collect her young relative. They have been waiting there ever since. Diana’s application is among tens of thousands stuck in a byzantine system that charities say is worsening the trauma of those fleeing war. Pevny, 58, said she faced the prospect of having to send Diana back to Ukraine as she could no longer afford to stay in Poland. “It cannot be right for a 12-year-old girl to leave a war zone and then, because the UK has a glitch in their visa scheme, have to go back to a war zone where Russians are committing war crimes against children and mothers,” she said. “We’re reading about all these mothers and children, who are Diana’s age, who are being raped around Kyiv. Can I actually as a human being return this child to Ukraine?” Pevny was told twice by the Home Office to apply to host Diana under the Homes for Ukraine scheme because, as a distant relative, she would not qualify as a close family member, although they are incredibly close as families and celebrate all their holidays together. But weeks after submitting an application under Homes for Ukraine, she found out that the rules had changed so that unaccompanied under-18s could not be brought to Britain. The safeguarding reasons behind this may be sound, but the change was not publicised or communicated to Pevny, who only found out when her MP, Daniel Zeichner, looked into her case. She now faces another long wait as her application is rerouted to the family scheme, with no prospect of success. Pevny said Diana was “traumatised” by the process: “She thinks that the UK does not want her. She thinks that I will leave her in Poland or send her back to the war zone. There must be a better way for the UK to help innocent children who are victims of the Russian war of aggression.” Charlie Richards, a market research consultant, has found himself managing visa applications on behalf of 22 Ukrainians who fled their homeland when Russia invaded. The group consists of six families of people aged from three years old to 70. They are scattered across Europe as they approach their sixth week of waiting for the green light to travel to the UK. Richards, 35, discovered on 4 April that more than half of his 22 applicants had been approved for visas but had not received them. He learned this only because Home Office officials visited a Ukrainian cultural centre near his home in Reading, so he asked them to check the status of their applications. They had been approved, some weeks ago, but never sent. He was astonished; the Home Office officials looked concerned. They came back four days later after looking into the issue. “They recognised it was a problem,” Richards said. The government only officially acknowledged the problem on Thursday, the day parliament was prorogued. Potentially thousands of people could have arrived in the UK weeks ago if their visas had been dispatched as soon as they had been approved. Three of Richards’ cases received visas 16 days after they were authorised. But that family are still in limbo halfway across Europe because three of their group are still waiting for their paperwork. Richards said the UK had “fundamentally let down a group of people we should have been there for as a country”. He added: “When you see that tens of thousands of people have supposedly been granted visas but haven’t got here yet, it’s impossible not to think the problem could be that widespread.” Alexandra, a Ukrainian refugee, said she was at a loss to understand why she has had to wait six weeks for a straightforward visa application to be processed. She fled Kherson and her visa application was lodged on the day the scheme opened, 18 March. “I feel like it’s a joke and a game from government for us,” she said. “It makes me so mad, the suspense and zero information. I don’t think they realise what we have been through.” Since fleeing Kherson with only her passport and a few items of clothing, Alexandra has been on a dangerous journey passing through Russia, Turkey and Bulgaria to get to Romania, where she is waiting for her visa to come through. A home is waiting for her in Warwickshire, where she has been sponsored by Daniel Edwards. But still the wait goes on. “I’ve exhausted so many different options trying to get in touch with MPs, the Home Office helpline, the visa office but there are still no results and no hope,” said Edwards. “The woman I’m sponsoring has been on such a dangerous journey from border to border. The visa should have arrived at least four weeks ago. It’s an absolute disgrace that it’s now more than 40 days since the original application.”",News/UK news,"‘No results, no hope’: Homes for Ukraine glitches lock refugees out of UK",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/02/homes-for-ukraine-glitches-lock-refugees-out-of-uk
