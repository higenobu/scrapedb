4/13/2022,"As might be expected, there is a polarity to the coverage in today’s papers of Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak being among those to receive a fixed-penalty notice over Partygate. “PM: I broke my own law but I refuse to go”, with Johnson and Sunak shown side by side, is on the front page of the Guardian. “Led by liars & lawbreakers” – that’s the assessment of the Mirror, which says the number of fines issued to government insiders has risen to a “shameful 50”.

4/13/2022,"US president Joe Biden has labelled Russia’s actions in Ukraine as “genocide”, saying Russian president Vladimir Putin “is trying to wipe out the idea of being able to be Ukrainian”. Biden made the remarks to reporters as he prepared to board Air Force One to return to Washington after an event on the economy in Iowa. “We’ll let the lawyers decide internationally whether or not it qualifies, but it sure seems that way to me,” he said. Putin’s closest ally in Ukraine, Viktor Medvedchuk, has been captured by Ukrainian law enforcement, Volodomyr Zelenskiy announced. Medvedchuk is the leader of the Opposition Platform for Life, Ukraine’s biggest opposition party. Zelenskiy proposed releasing him to Russia in exchange for Ukrainians captured by Russian forces. Zelenskiy also warned Russia: “Let Medvedchuk be an example for you. Even the former oligarch did not escape, not to mention much more ordinary criminals from the Russian boondocks. We will get everyone.” Zelenskiy said it is “not yet possible” to draw 100% conclusions about what kind of substance was used in Mariupol on Tuesday. Earlier, he voiced concerns that Russian forces were preparing “a new stage of terror” that could involve the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine. Andriy Biletsky, the leader of the Azov volunteer regiment, claimed on Monday that three people in the southern port city had experienced “poisoning by warfare chemicals, but without catastrophic consequences”. However, some observers have expressed skepticism that the available evidence points towards a chemical weapons attack. It is too soon to say definitively what happened, but one expert cautioned that it remained unclear whether chemicals, let alone chemical weapons, had been used, based on the evidence initially available. A senior US defence official said the US cannot confirm reports of use of chemical weapons in Mariupol. Civilians have fled eastern Ukraine in advance of a widely forecast attack and Russian forces closed in on the ruins of the southern city of Mariupol. Ukrainian forces were preparing for a new Russian offensive in the east of the country, with the governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Gaidai, urging residents to evacuate as soon as possible using agreed humanitarian corridors. The mayor of Mariupol, Vadym Boichenko, said the latest estimate was that around 21,000 civilian residents had been killed in the Ukrainian port city since the start of the Russian invasion. The number of deaths in Mariupol could be as high as 22,000, Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of the Donetsk regional military administration, told CNN. The mayor of the Ukrainian town of Bucha, near Kyiv, said authorities had so far found 403 bodies of people they believed were killed by Russian forces during their occupation of the area. That number was still growing, Anatoliy Fedoruk said, adding that it was too early for residents to return to the town. Putin said Ukraine had deviated from the agreements made at a peace conference in Istanbul, and that talks were in a “dead end”. When asked about the Russian president’s comments, a member of the Ukrainian delegation, Mykhailo Podolyak, said negotiations with Russians were very hard but were continuing. Putin also claimed Russia’s military operation was going as planned, and that Russia’s aim in Ukraine was to meet all its goals and minimise losses. “We will achieve our objectives, there are no doubts,” Putin told workers at the Vostochny cosmodrome in Russia’s far east. “Its goals are absolutely clear and noble,” he said of Russia’s military campaign. He said Russia “had no other choice” but to launch what he calls a “special military operation”, and vowed it would “continue until its full completion and the fulfilment of the tasks that have been set”. The World Bank is planning financial support to Ukraine worth $1.5bn (£1.2bn) to help keep critical services running as the country fights a fresh assault by Russia. The bank said the funds would be used to support the continuation of key government services, including wages for hospital workers, pensions for elderly people and social programmes for vulnerable people. A Briton who has been fighting with the Ukrainian armed forces in the besieged city of Mariupol has been forced to surrender along with his unit to the Russians because they have run out of food and ammunition. Aiden Aslin, from Newark, joined Ukraine’s marines in 2018 but has told friends and family that he and his comrades cannot hold out any longer as the Russians gradually tighten their grip on the southern port city. Zelenskiy rejected a request by the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, to visit Kyiv along with other European politicians on Wednesday. According a report in the German newspaper Bild, the reason for the denial was the German Social Democrat’s previously close ties to the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and his history as an advocate of close Russian-German economic ties.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 49 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-49-of-the-invasion
