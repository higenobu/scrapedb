1/18/2022,"Fox News' Laura Ingraham appeared jubilant when reporting on Gen. Mark Milley's COVID diagnosis. Milley has long been a hate figure for Trump supporters. Ingraham discussed Milley's case on a section of her show where she pushes vaccine misinformation. Fox News host Laura Ingraham clapped in celebration when reporting that Gen. Mark Milley, the highest-ranking US military officer, tested postive for COVID. In ""Positively Boosted"", a regular segment on her show when she showcases vaccinated public figures who catch COVID-19, Ingraham on Monday night discussed the news of Milley's diagnosis. ""All right, the triple vaxxed Joint Chiefs chairman Mark Milley – our favorite, Mark Milley! – tested positive for Covid yesterday,"" Ingraham said while clapping. ""And who else? General David Berger, the Marine Corps commandant, also positively boosted."" The graphic that aired during the segment noted that Milley is suffering only mild symptoms. His testing positive was announced by a spokesman on Sunday, who said Milley would be isolating. Public health authorities and experts have been clear that that the highly contagious Omicron variant, currently surging in the US and other countries, can infect vaccinated people. Although it gives some defense against getting sick, vaccination is mainly effective at protecting against severe illness and death from the virus. Ingraham has long been accused of pushing claims on her show designed to erode trust in COVID vaccines. Milley has become a hate figure for some Donald Trump supporters in light of reports that he acted to head off what he thought was a coup by Trump in the last weeks of his presidency. The actions were described in Bob Woodward's recent book, ""Rage,"" which said that Milley thought Trump so unstable after losing the 2020 election that he could start a nuclear war. In Congressional testimony last June Milley defended the teaching of critical race theory in the military, an issue that incensed some conservatives. Milley has become a frequent target of scorn for Trump at his rallies. Read the original article on Business Insider",U.S./INSIDER,"Laura Ingraham clapped in celebration while reporting that Gen.

1/18/2022,"By Kane Wu Hong Kong (Reuters) - Private equity firm Affinity Equity Partners is this week launching the sale of its Burger King fast-food businesses in South Korea and Japan, in a deal that could fetch more than $1 billion, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Hong Kong-based Affinity has appointed Goldman Sachs to run the sale, which is targeting both private equity investors and strategic buyers, said the person, who declined to be identified as the information is confidential. The bank declined to comment. Affinity bought full control of Burger King South Korea in 2016 for about $170 million and a year later acquired the American fast-food brand's Japan franchise. The South Korean business reported 680 billion won ($572 million) in revenue in 2021, with adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) at 80 billion won ($67 million), said the person, adding its adjusted EBITDA in 2022 is expected to reach 100 billion won. Burger King Japan's adjusted EBITDA in 2021 was 700 million yen ($6 million), the person said. Global fast-food chains such as McDonald's and Yum! Brands are trading at 20 to 30 times their EBITDA, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. Burger King India is trading at about 25 times of its EBITDA. Affinity and Burger King Japan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An official at BKR Corporation, the operator of Burger King in South Korea, declined to comment. The Nikkei business daily first reported the sale on Monday. It comes as the consumer and retail sector faces tremendous challenges and disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic. In South Korea, businesses have adapted by relying more on deliveries, which has prompted exponential growth for its food delivery apps. Burger King Korea said on Monday the number of monthly active users on its mobile app in December exceeded 1.4 million, the highest since the app was launched in May 2016. Since Affinity's acquisition, Burger King has been in an expansion mode in South Korea and Japan. Burger King runs 440 outlets in South Korea, more than its rival McDonald's. The Japan franchise said on Monday it would open three new outlets in January, bringing the total there to 149, with plans to open more ""aggressively"" in 2022.

1/18/2022,"Rona MacInnes, 54, was determined to do everything possible to protect her elderly mother as her family prepared to gather for Christmas in Pennington, N.J. With her son returning from study in Dublin, MacInnes hoped serial at-home coronavirus tests would catch a coronavirus infection he might bring home. The college junior would take six rapid tests before the holiday, all of which returned negative results. But it would become clear only later - after he had spent time with his grandmother - that he had been infected the whole time. Several days after gathering for Christmas, he got a positive result back from the first available lab-based PCR test he was able to book. Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post. The result floored and frightened MacInnes, creating fresh worries about her 80-year-old mother. The family quickly booked an appointment to get a PCR test for her mother that came back negative. ""Thankfully none of us have developed symptoms,"" MacInnes said. The promise of at-home tests to tell people whether they are infectious has been undercut not just by anecdotal reports like MacInnes's, but by preliminary data that suggest some of the rapid tests may be less sensitive to the now-dominant omicron variant. Studies suggest they detect infections most reliably two to five days after exposure in people with high viral loads who are experiencing symptoms, which is why people are urged to take the tests serially. But even then, they are not foolproof. And for those who have taken pains to find out if their sniffle and sore throat might be harbingers of covid-19 to protect others, contradictory test results are often dismaying. A New York woman who relied on negative rapid test results to go out with her friends on New Year's Eve only to get back a positive PCR test result afterward said she believes the at-home tests offer ""a false sense of security."" The Food and Drug Administration acknowledged the issue on Dec. 28, noting that ""early data suggests that antigen tests do detect the omicron variant but may have reduced sensitivity."" A week later, a small preprint study that has not yet been peer-reviewed found the rapid tests failed to detect the virus on day zero and day one after infection for 30 individuals in New York and San Francisco. In 28 of those cases, PCR tests indicated that the patients' virus levels were high enough on those days to make them infectious. (Several authors of the study serve as unpaid board members of SalivaDirect, a PCR test protocol affiliated with the Yale School of Public Health.) A much larger preprint study from researchers in California that looked at 731 samples found that Abbott's BinaxNOW rapid test performed about as well in detecting infections caused by the omicron variant as it had for those caused by other variants, especially among people with symptoms. But the tests failed to detect about 10% of lab-confirmed positive cases among asymptomatic people, who may have been tested very early in their infections. ""Our data support the recommendation for repeat rapid antigen testing for persons at risk for covid-19 who have an initial negative BinaxNOW result,"" the researchers said. - - - Public health experts say that at-home tests were never expected to be as sensitive as the PCR tests performed in a lab or clinic because of the different ways they work. The PCR tests use a technique called polymerase chain reaction to amplify trace amounts of virus DNA. While they're considered the gold standard for detecting infection, it can take 12 hours to several days to deliver results and cost $150 or more without insurance coverage. By comparison, rapid tests, also called antigen tests, are cheaper and most people can administer them at home. They return results in as little as 15 minutes by detecting antigens, a type of protein on the surface of the virus. But since rapid tests don't magnify the virus, a person needs to have produced enough antigens in their body to return a positive result. The good news, researchers say, is that two newly authorized rapid tests coming to market later this month work well in detecting omicron, the now-dominant variant. The FDA issued emergency use authorizations for the tests by Roche and Siemens Healthineers in late December. ""Help is on the way,"" said Wilbur Lam, a physician and biomedical engineer at Emory University who runs the lab tasked by the National Institutes of Health with evaluating the performance of the rapid tests on the market. ""The two new [tests] coming out perform really well."" Lam leads the Atlanta Center for Microsystems Engineered Point-of-Care Technologies, which the government enlisted to evaluate coronavirus tests beginning in March 2020. He has no affiliation with Roche or Siemens. Lam explained that each antigen test uses different lab-made antibodies, which ""act like glue to 'capture' and detect virus,"" and some are better at detecting omicron than others. He said his lab has been evaluating all of the existing tests, including the new ones from Roche and Siemens, to see how they stack up against the omicron variant. ""It happens that these two new tests have very good antibodies that 'stick' very well to the virus, likely better than the antibodies of other tests on the market,"" Lam added. Consumers will be able to purchase Roche tests beginning in late January, spokeswoman Michelle Johnson said in an email. A Siemens spokesman said it is too early to say when its tests will reach stores, but production is already ramping up. Both companies are expected to produce tens of millions of at-home test kits each month, helping to boost the nation's supply of rapid tests. Lam said that when the omicron variant first reached the United States in mid-November, he and his colleagues used inactivated virus samples to test all of the rapid tests on the market. All performed well. But when they began evaluating the tests against live samples of omicron, some of the tests appeared to be less sensitive to the variant. ""There could be a bunch of different reasons for this,"" Lam said. Some substrains of the variant may produce less of the antigen that the tests are designed to detect. And differences among patients - their vaccination status, severity of infection and how long they've had symptoms - may also affect how well the tests work. ""All these things are still theoretical,"" Lam said of the early findings. ""And we just need to do more rigorous testing."" Omicron may also proliferate in different parts of the body than other variants, sparking some debate over whether people should rely on nasal swabs or throat swabs for antigen tests. The FDA has advised against doing throat swabs because it says the rapid tests were not designed for them. - - - More reliable rapid tests can't come soon enough for people eager to resume their pre-pandemic lives. After a New Year's Eve spent among four friends who all tested before gathering, a painful headache and dry cough spurred a 58-year-old New York City woman to take another rapid test on Wednesday. The test came back negative, but her symptoms persisted, so she decided to get a PCR test on Thursday. The PCR test came back positive. ""Everybody thought, 'We're going to test - that's the key to freedom,' "" said the woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she is in interviews to change jobs. ""And the problem is, if people are getting these false negatives, they're adding to the spread."" Because a person's virus levels fluctuate over the course of an infection and the rapid tests do not magnify tiny bits of virus, experts say that a single negative rapid test result does not preclude that an individual is infected. That's why they advise the tests be used serially - at least two over the course of several days, although that can be difficult because the tests are costly and still in short supply. With the omicron variant, infected people also appear less likely to return positive results during the first day or two of symptoms. ""Some people turn positive two days after exposure, some three days, some four days, some five days,"" said William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases and preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. ""All of this leads to a great deal of confusion."" That uncertainty is why the tests were never designed to be used ""as a 'Get Out of Jail Free card,' "" to leave quarantine or isolation, he added. False positives from rapid tests are much less likely, although they happen occasionally, Schaffner said. ""If you use any test in a population where the risk of having a true positive is very, very, very low, you can get false positive results just by chance alone, because no test is perfect,"" he said. But many experts say that a positive result from a rapid test should always be treated as a true positive. That is especially true because infections caused by the omicron variant appear to move faster than those caused by other variants, said Lam, the Emory biomedical engineer. A positive result on a rapid test followed by a negative result on a PCR test may mean that a patient was infected, but stopped producing virus by the time of the second test, he added. ""If the rapid antigen test says you're positive, then you're probably definitely positive - and you're likely infectious,"" Lam said.

1/18/2022,"WASHINGTON – Sen. Ted Cruz didn't need the money. He wanted to make a point. A day before his successful reelection in 2018, the Texas Republican loaned his own campaign $260,000. When the deadline came to repay the money, his campaign didn't fully reimburse him, so Cruz could challenge a law that has bitterly divided Republicans and Democrats over how candidates fund their campaigns. The Supreme Court will hear arguments in that challenge Wednesday. On the surface, Cruz is asking the high court to strike down an obscure provision of law that dictates what happens when candidates loan money to their own campaigns. Simmering below that is a bigger fight over what the Biden administration views as an anti-corruption effort and what critics see as a perk for incumbents. Caught in the crossfire is a landmark, if controversial law signed by President George W. Bush in 2002 that set new limits on political donations, tried to quash ""soft money"" that skirted those limits and required federal candidates to include the now ubiquitous ""I approve this message"" tag line when they run ads on TV. 'Prodigious': Blind judge leaves mark on influential federal appeals court Abortion: Why the Supreme Court may look to China as it reconsiders Roe v. Wade Conservatives on the Supreme Court have repeatedly chipped away at that law, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act. Cruz asserts the First Amendment demands the court strike down another chunk. ""What it is is an effort to point out the inconsistencies and the absurdities, not just in this part of the BCRA but in many parts,"" said Erik Jaffe, a prominent lawyer and critic of the law who filed a brief supporting Cruz. At issue are federal requirements governing how campaigns repay loans from a candidate in excess of $250,000. Any amount over that threshold has to be repaid within 20 days or it converts to a donation, meaning the candidate can't recover it. A campaign is prohibited from repaying any amount above $250,000 from post-election contributions. If campaigns can't repay that money with contributions made before the election, the candidate has to take the loss. The idea behind the prohibition is simple: Without it, contributions to a successful candidate's campaign would essentially wind up directly in the politician's pocket, since the money would be used by the campaign to pay back the candidate. That, supporters of the law say, increases the risk of corruption. ""Common sense suggests, for example, that the risk of corruption is greater when an officeholder receives $2,900 that he can use to pay down his mortgage than when he receives $2,900 that his campaign can use to pay for more placards,"" the Federal Election Commission told the Supreme Court in a brief filed last summer. Cruz, who was made whole for $250,000 of his loan, acknowledged his campaign purposefully did not pay back the remaining $10,000, so he could challenge the law. After his race against Democrat Beto O'Rourke in 2018, Cruz's campaign had roughly $2.4 million in the bank. Opponents say repaying a candidate loan is no different than settling bills with ad makers, pollsters and staff. And, they say, the prohibition makes it harder for a challenger to compete against better-funded incumbents. ""This makes it harder for challengers of modest means to get sufficient name recognition early in the process without having to stake their savings ... on the outcome,"" Jaffe said. Advocates on the other side worry about a sweeping decision from the Supreme Court that could hamper the FEC's ability to regulate other money-in-politics provisions. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., asked the court for exactly that outcome. McConnell pointed out in a brief that the loan provisions of the BCRA were bundled into what became known as the ""millionaire's amendment"" when the bill was working its way through Congress. The amendment was intended to curb the ability of wealthy candidates to buy their way into office by restricting loans and allowing candidates running against self-funders to collect contributions in addition to the normal limits. More: Same-sex marriage, contraception could be threatened by abortion ruling More: Native Americans are winning at the Supreme Court – with help from Gorsuch The amendment was essential to the bill's passage in 2001, McConnell said. Three years later, it helped a little-known Democratic state senator and law professor running for U.S. Senate, Barack Obama. As Obama ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008, a narrow majority of the Supreme Court struck down the provision of the amendment that dealt with donor limits. If the court invalidates the loan provisions, McConnell said, the justices may as well scrap the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act altogether. ""From the beginning,"" McConnell told the court, the law ""was a constitutional train wreck."" The Supreme Court's decisions over the past two decades, he wrote, have turned the act into ""the Humpty Dumpty of campaign-finance law."" Experts don't expect the court will go that far.  Still, there's always a possibility a decision leads to unforeseen consequences. ""Whenever a campaign finance case goes to the Supreme Court, particularly the court as currently constituted, it gives them an opportunity to create broader principles that might affect other campaign finance cases,"" said Tara Malloy, a senior director at the Campaign Legal Center. She said the court could whittle away at the FEC's ability to head off corruption. ""It's sort of a death by a thousand cuts,"" she said. ""If the government has to somehow show 100 cases of bribery by loan repayments [to enforce the BCRA's provisions], that's going to be a bar that the government can never clear."" The Supreme Court has issued landmark decisions that roll back federal campaign finance rules, including a ruling in 2010 that permitted outside groups to spend unlimited money in elections. Another decision four years later lifted caps on how much individuals may give to all candidates and committees during an election cycle. Cruz's case, which arrives at the Supreme Court in a midterm election year, is on appeal from a special three-judge panel that unanimously sided with his position last summer. The panel, which included one judge nominated by a Democratic president and two nominated by a Republican, ruled the government failed to demonstrate that the prohibitions prevented quid pro quo corruption. Before he was a senator, Cruz was a frequent presence at the Supreme Court, arguing cases both in private practice and as Texas' solicitor general. He successfully defended the state's 2003 redistricting plan, for instance. In 2004, he beat back an effort to reopen the murder convictions of dozens of Mexican nationals. Cruz, who did not respond to a request for comment, told the court in legal papers last month that the loan provision ""intrudes deeply on the rights of candidates and their campaign committees to make constitutionally protected decisions."" During the ""heat of a campaign,"" he said, candidates must calculate whether they will be able to comply with the loan requirements even if they lose the election, or whether they'll wind up losing their money. The law, Cruz said, ""intensifies and distorts these inherent risks, deliberately curbing the funding, and thus the speech, of candidates, their campaigns, and their contributors.""

1/18/2022,"With the Federal Reserve now widely expected to jack up interest rates in March to beat back rampant inflation, investors in the stock market should buckle up for a more muted few months of returns, says Goldman Sachs chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin.  The S&P 500 has been ""resilient"" around the start of Fed hiking cycles in the past, Kostin notes. But one could interpret that resiliency Kostin speaks of in different ways.  The first is that the stock market didn't fall off a cliff as borrowing conditions became tighter, but losses did come to market goers. The S&P 500 has dropped 6% on average during the three months following the first rate increase of recent cycles, Kostin finds.  On the other hand, the weakness in stocks has proven short-lived. The Goldman strategist finds the S&P 500 has returned 5% in the six months following the first rate hike of a cycle.  Either way you look at it, the evolving backdrop requires a careful recalibration of one's approach to investing. That may be especially so at the start of this cycle, as Goldman Sachs is looking for 10 interest rate increases before 2025. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon didn't rule out seven interest rate increases this year in his typical free-wheeling earnings call with analysts.  ""The start of Fed hiking cycles tends to coincide with a strong economy, which can help to lift cyclical sectors (materials, industrials, energy). At the factor level, value stocks tend to outperform in the months before and after the first hike. High quality factors (e.g., high margins, strong balance sheets) underperform in the strong economic environment preceding hikes and outperform in the months following the initial rate increase. Growth is the worst performing factor in the six months around the first hike,"" explains Kostin.  To be sure, the stock market is behaving in line with Kostin's work on returns and Fed hiking cycles. The S&P 500 is down 2.79% in 2022 so far, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost 1.84%. The Nasdaq Composite has shed a whopping 5.93% year-to-date. More than one-third of companies in the index are at least 50% from their 52-week highs, according to Bloomberg data. High multiple tech stocks continue to be under severe pressure, notably fintech player Block (formerly Square), which is hovering around a 52-week low. ""We are in this adjustment process, which might be a little patchy. We are adjusting from an economy that was very strong and the Fed was doing nothing. This is clearly changing,"" said iCapital chief investment strategist Anastasia Amoroso on Yahoo Finance Live. ""We are seeing this stepped down lowering of activity — still solid but slower. But now the Fed is starting to do something about it. That's what is causing some volatility here.

1/18/2022,"With its concrete jungles, ongoing construction, packed highways and deteriorating condos desperately reaching skyward away from the floodwaters, Florida is truly one of the most beautiful states in the country. At least, it is according to photography and printing experts Printique, which ranked the states in order of beauty and decided that Florida is the third most beautiful state in the land. Not too shabby for what is essentially an overflowing, frequently toxic swamp filling rapidly with New Yorkers. Did these experts visit the scenic Florida Keys? The gatortastic Everglades? The west coast with its jaw dropping sunsets and annoying, championship-winning sports teams? No. The experts scored states by counting the number of registered historic places, national parks, national historic landmarks, Instagram hashtags, and the number of Google searches its most popular location receives. So it’s legit: Everyone knows, Instagram hashtags tell all. The most beautiful state is Rhode Island, apparently. We know, we know. We were a little puzzled ourselves. But the photographers and printers applaud the fact that the country’s smallest state has the largest number of historic places, national parks and national landmarks registered for its size. There are approximately four registered historic places for every 10 square miles — the highest ratio on the list. Take that, Arizona, with your otherworldly landscapes and super big, photogenic canyon. No. 2 was Massachusetts. The rest of the top 10: New York, California, Maryland, New Jersey, Connecticut, Tennessee and Hawaii. We are not sure how anyone in their right mind thinks New Jersey is more beautiful than Hawaii, but then we make no claim to be experts. The least picturesque state, Printique says, is North Dakota. Since no one has ever actually been there, we can’t corroborate this. But we do know that listing Wyoming at No. 49 is a bit dubious, as Yellowstone National Park and the Beartooth Highway are things that exist.
