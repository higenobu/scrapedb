2/2/2022,"When Cecilie Fjellhøy first met the man she knew as Simon Leviev for a 10am coffee date at the Four Seasons Hotel in London in January 2018, he seemed to align with his Tinder profile. His pictures were flashy – designer clothes and expensive sunglasses in luxury cars and private jets – and his in-person demeanor was equally debonair. “He has this magnetism,” Fjellhøy recalls of her first impression in the Netflix documentary The Tinder Swindler, out this week. “There’s something about this guy that is special.”  Fjellhøy, then a 29-year-old Norwegian graduate student living in London, was charmed by the man who claimed to be the “prince of diamonds”, a billionaire heir to the diamond fortune of the Israeli magnate Lev Leviev. And she was surprised: Simon had to leave that afternoon for a business trip in Sofia, Bulgaria. Would she like to go with him via private jet? She agreed – “I felt I would be stupid if I said no,” she says – and the film, directed by Felicity Morris, stitches together the trip through the documentation on Fjellhøy’s phone. There’s a “Yolo” WhatsApp message to her friends; photos of Leviev’s security team aboard the private jet; video of the woman and toddler Leviev said were his ex and child, and one in which Fjellhøy kisses him on the cheek. They spent the night together in the hotel, and she flew back to London the next day, smitten with the man with whom she began exchanging messages daily. This being called The Tinder Swindler, it’s not a happily ever after; it would take Fjellhøy months, $250,000 in unpaid loans, and an investigative team from Norway’s largest paper to figure it out, but nothing Leviev said or did was truthful. The bodyguard? A hired poser. The jet? Paid for by another swindled woman’s money. The woman Leviev said was his ex, who assured Fjellhøy he was a stand-up guy? One of three women he had swindled in Finland before he was convicted and imprisoned there in 2015, who still associated with him for reasons that remain unclear (she declined to participate in the film). Even the name Simon Leviev was a dodge; the “Simon <3” in her phone was actually a serial catfisher and conman born Shimon Yehuda Hayut to a middle-class Jewish orthodox family in suburban Israel – no billionaire father. (In 2017, upon release from the Finnish prison, he legally changed his name to Simon Leviev.)  “This isn’t just catfishing – this is catfishing on a whole other level,” Morris told the Guardian. “There’s not the red flags you think there are in these stories.” “We’re all a little bit guilty of gold-plating our lives, whether it be on Instagram or what have you,” she added. “But Simon, when you meet him, everything stacks up.” For Fjellhøy and the two other women who tell their stories in the film – Pernilla Sjoholm, from Sweden, and Ayleen Charlotte from Amsterdam – as well as others who have not come forward, “it’s almost like they enter a Truman Show, being played out for them, where he’s got a bodyguard, he does actually fly around in a private jet,” said Morris. For most of its first half, the nearly two-hour film weaves Fjellhøy’s first-person account with Sjoholm’s, who met Leivev on Tinder in March 2018. Their connection was initially romantic but turned into a deep friendship; Leviev brought along Sjoholm on trips to Mykonos, Rome and elsewhere with other Tinder dates, and the two messaged consistently for eight months. As Leviev partied lavishly with Sjoholm, Fjellhøy was looking, at his request, for London flats to rent together. Three months into dating, she received disturbing photos of Leviev and his bodyguard covered in blood, and a request for $25,000 – according to Leviev, his enemies were tracing his credit card payments. Fjellhøy had no reason to doubt her boyfriend would be good for the money, and who else was closer to him? She took out credit cards, loans and more loans for more requests, as Leviev repeatedly assured her that payment would come through the next day, then the next. It didn’t. Fjellhøy had been tricked, fallout from which rains throughout the second half of the film, as she links up with journalists at the Norwegian paper VG, and eventually Sjoholm and Charlotte, to unravel Leviev’s long history of cons dating back to his teenage years in Israel. (VG’s investigative piece, featuring messages, voice notes and video that is worked into the film, was published in 2019.) Losing the money and credit was bad enough, but losing the man she thought cared about her – the boyfriend who sent her roses and doting voice notes, the one who made a surprise last-minute trip to Oslo to see her – was a worse gut punch. The con was as much emotional as financial. Leviev “wasn’t being a kind of James Bond character with these girls”, said Morris. “Yes he’d send them flowers, and he’d remember their birthday, and he’d be really sweet, but it wasn’t like they were getting anything. He wasn’t giving them designer handbags or amazing holidays. He was just a very consistent, loving boyfriend.” The normal red flags or hiccups – not texting back, ghosting, lack of interest – didn’t apply to Simon, and the bar for dating was so low that this in and of itself was remarkable. “Simon was the perfect man for these women,” said Morris, “and that wasn’t in a material way. That was in an emotional way.” “We’ve all grown up on this diet of romcom movies and the idea of finding the love of your life, your Prince Charming, to sweep you off your feet,” said Morris, who works in clips from classic Hollywood romances into the film. “I definitely think that Simon plays on that.” The final section of the film, which simply must be seen to be fully appreciated and moves beyond the scope of the VG story, works in testimony and comeuppance from Charlotte, who dated Leviev for 18 months and also loaned him significant amounts of money that was never repaid. Morris stitches together VG’s investigations, Charlotte’s recollections, and menacing voice and text messages from Leviev to reveal a vindictive pathological liar finally snagged by his past. It’s thanks to all three women that he was arrested in 2019 in Greece and extradited to Israel; he was sentenced to 15 months in prison for theft and fraud charges he skipped out on in 2011, and released after five months due to good behavior. Simon Leviev, as he is still legally named (his now-private Instagram account, @simon_leviev_official, currently has 97,500 followers, bot percentage unknown), declined to formally participate in the film, though he did respond to WhatsApp messages from the Morris’s team. There was a “back-and-forth between us and various lawyers that he had employed for us to speak to”, said Morris, but “an interview never materialized.” Leviev, however, did send voice notes that are included in the film in which he denies all the women’s claims of fraud and threatens legal action. Despite the name, The Tinder Swindler is not actually that much about Tinder, or a warning against the perils of online dating. “We’re not saying that people shouldn’t use dating apps,” said Morris. “We’re not saying that people should be more cautious than they are, because most people are cautious.” Instead, the message is more one of perseverance through gaslighting, financial ruin and the fear of judgment. Fjellhøy, Sjoholm and Charlotte knew the reaction and skepticism that would come from speaking out, yet “they’ve been brave enough to say well, actually, the only real way that we’re going to get justice is to expose him,” said Morris. That justice, if not in jail time or financial restitution, can come through a public record. The first thing you do with a Tinder match is Google them, says Fejllhøy, who is still on the app, at the end of the film. And the results for Simon Leviev?

2/2/2022,"Morning everyone. I’m Martin Farrer and these are today’s top stories.  A day after promising to reboot his faltering government, Boris Johnson faces fresh allegations about lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street after the Guardian learned that he attended a prosecco-fuelled leaving do for a No 10 aide during the strict post-Christmas shutdown last year. The alleged party is now under police investigation. Sue Gray’s investigation into lockdown parties revealed several events that had not previously been publicised, including a gathering on 14 January 2021 “on the departure of two No 10 private secretaries”. But the redacted report revealed no further details. Sources said the event was held in Downing Street in part as a leaving do for a senior policy adviser who is now a top civil servant working in the culture department. Three gatherings allegedly attended by Johnson are now being investigated by police. Anger continues to simmer on the Tory backbenches after Johnson’s allies briefed that he had won over his party despite the damage of the Gray report. As splits appear in the One Nation group of Tory centrists, veteran MP Peter Aldous said he had submitted a letter of no confidence and MP Tom Hunt criticised Johnson’s “cack-handed” backers. However, there was some cheer for the Tories as many welcomed the return of Lynton Crosby, the Australian campaign guru, to the prime minister’s side as part of No 10’s planned fightback. Levelling up – Michael Gove will lead another key strand of the government’s attempted reset today when he launches the flagship levelling-up white paper, with targets to reduce inequalities across society by 2030 to be enshrined in law. The communities secretary will promise to “call time on the postcode lottery” of inequalities across Britain, setting 12 legally binding “missions” to improve health, living standards, transport, crime and wellbeing by the end of the decade. Labour has dismissed the policy as “new slogans without new ideas”, while research exposes the inequality of the funding formula. Putin speaks out – Vladimir Putin has accused the US of trying to lure his country into war by giving military backing to Ukraine as the tense standoff over Moscow’s military buildup in eastern Ukraine continued. In his first public comments on the growing crisis since December, Russia’s president said the west was ignoring Russia’s security proposals and was using Ukraine to spark a conflict. Boris Johnson warned on a flying visit to Kyiv that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would end in a humanitarian, political and military disaster for Russia and the world. And our diplomatic editor argues that the Ukraine crisis is the first post-Brexit test for Britain to show that it is not a global irrelevance as many predicted it would become. It is also a test that Johnson cannot afford to fail. Further Greenwood arrest – Manchester United footballer Mason Greenwood has been further arrested on suspicion of sexual assault and making threats to kill. The 20-year-old was arrested on suspicion of rape and assault on Sunday after police saw a woman reporting claims of physical violence and sexual threats on social media. Greater Manchester police, who have not identified the player by name, said yesterday that a suspect had been further arrested on suspicion of sexual assault and making threats to kill after they were granted further time to question him. Police have until later today to decide whether to charge or release him. Goldberg suspended – Whoopi Goldberg has been suspended from a US talk show after saying in a TV appearance that the Holocaust was “not about race”. The 66-year-old actor apologised for her remarks on The Late Show and again on the next broadcast of The View on Tuesday morning. But now she has been suspended from the latter programme “effective immediately”, the ABC network said last night. ‘Fraud epidemic’ – An influential group of MPs has urged the government to tackle a “fraud epidemic” across Britain, amid concerns about the increasing financial toll on consumers and taxpayers from economic crime. The Commons Treasury committee said ministers needed to bring in fresh laws after a 43% jump in fraud and computer misuse between June 2019 and June 2021. It comes amid mounting anger over official figures that showed ministers spent almost £9bn on personal protective equipment that was either substandard, defective, past its use-by date or overpriced. Blooming early – If you think plants are flowering much earlier than they used to, you’re right: a new study says blooms are coming out a month earlier in the UK as the climate heats up. Researchers led by a Cambridge professor examined 420,000 recorded dates of first flowering for more than 400 species, dating to 1793. The average date for the first blooms was about 12 May up to 1986, but since then the date has been pushed forward to 16 April. An attack on a prison in northern Syria by Islamic State fighters led to a six-day siege that marked the terror group’s most dramatic stand since the collapse of its “caliphate” nearly three years ago.

2/2/2022,"Badly built roads can generate more hazard than a significant earthquake, research shows. Hakan Tanyaş, from the University of Twente in the Netherlands, and colleagues monitored the size and number of landslips in the Arhavi area of north-eastern Turkey between 2010 and 2020. During this period several roads were constructed through the region to access a new hydroelectric scheme. The scientists show that development had a shocking impact on the stability of the hillsides, with road construction responsible for more than 90% of the observed landslips in the region.  Their calculations, reported in the Natural Hazards journal, suggest the volume of debris created by these excess landslips is equivalent to the area being shaken by a magnitude 6 earthquake. Because much of this sediment ends up in rivers, the scientists say it will change the way rivers flow and increase the probability and severity of flooding. Writing in The Landslide Blog, Dave Petley from the University of Sheffield, says road-induced landslides are a global issue. “The sad element of this is that these landslides almost entirely avoidable – such road-related landslide impacts are down to poor engineering practice. “Roads do not need to be built in this way, and there are plenty of examples of good practice from around the world.”",News/Science,How impact of bad roads can be worse than an earthquake,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/02/impact-bad-roads-earthquake-construction-landslips
2/2/2022,"The warm home discount scheme, which at the moment offers a £140 discount to those on certain benefits during the winter months, has come under the spotlight as ministers explore ways to tackle the impact of the energy crisis on household bills. The government has said the discount will be increased next winter, and the Labour party pledged it would add to the funding and expand its coverage.  The scheme offers vulnerable energy customers a discount on their energy bills each winter. Since 2014/15 the discount has been worth £140 a year. Discounts are given automatically to people on pension credit, but other low-income households must apply and only get help if their providers offer the scheme and there is still money available. The money comes off bills, rather than being paid to customers. The energy companies fund the discount, with the money coming from customers’ bills. The sums put in are mandated by the government. This year suppliers have put in a total of £350m, which has added about £14 to bills. Next year they will put in more – a consultation last year suggested £475m in total – which will cost customers £19. The Treasury does not currently add to the scheme. Around 2m households currently qualify to apply – but not all will be able to get hold of the discount. If you are on pension credit you should have automatically been accepted. If not, you need to apply. Applications are currently only available to those on low incomes who receive certain benefits, including income support and universal credit, and meet other qualifying criteria. More than 900,000 eligible pensioners who have not applied for pension credit are thought to miss out each year. Only energy suppliers with at least 150,000 customers have to offer the discount currently, so those with smaller companies miss out. When providers have allocated all of their required funds, schemes are closed. EDF and Scottish Power have both already stopped taking applications. EDF said it had provided about 260,000 rebates worth a total of £36m. It said it had other support for customers, including a Customer Support Fund (CSF) for help with an outstanding debt or replacing essential white goods. A Scottish Power spokesperson said the scheme had been open between August and December, as in previous years, and it had worked hard to raise awareness among customers, which had led to it being fully subscribed. “Supporting customers in vulnerable circumstances is one of our priorities,” the spokesperson said. “As well as the warm home discount, we offer a wide range of customer support – like our prepayment voucher scheme – and we also support a number of external industry initiatives. We would encourage any customers having difficulty paying their bills to contact us.” Next winter the discount will go up to £150 and the government will change the criteria to focus on those in fuel poverty. This will only affect energy customers in England and Wales. The changes follow a consultation before the energy crisis took hold, which also proposed offering automatic payments to everyone who qualifies, rather than asking people to apply. The government has not confirmed that it will make that change. It has also proposed to reduce the number of households who miss out because their energy provider is too small by lowering the number of customers a supplier must have to 50,000 in April 2022 and then to 1,000 from April 2023. At that point, the government said an estimated 99.99% of domestic customers would be with suppliers that had to offer the discount. A business department spokesperson said: “As set out in the energy white paper, from 2022/23, we plan to extend the warm home discount until 2026, increase it by £10 to £150, and help an extra 780,000 pensioners and low-income families with their energy bills.” Charities have welcomed the changes – Citizens Advice, for example, suggests the biggest problems with the scheme will be addressed. Gillian Cooper, head of energy policy at Citizens Advice, said currently rebates were unfairly distributed. Because the number of rebates for each company is based on their customer numbers rather than need “every year we see clients who miss out on rebates because their supplier is oversubscribed. Conversely, some suppliers are unable to give out all the rebates they’re required to, because their customers are more affluent, and put the unspent money towards alternative support instead.” However, others have called for the government to inject some money into the scheme so that discounts can be more meaningful. The fuel poverty charity, National Energy Action says the government needs to pay in £500m to make sure those who qualify can all get the money and to increase the discount. “As a very bare minimum, the scheme should at least be sufficient to make sure that everybody eligible for it should get it automatically,” says Peter Smith, director of policy at the charity. “A £500m injection from the Treasury would mean that everyone currently eligible could automatically receive a discount of just over £200.” Adding government funding to the scheme would be cheaper than scrapping VAT on energy, a proposal that the government is understood to be considering. The end of VAT on bills would cost the Treasury an estimated £2bn and not be targeted at the households in greatest need.",News/Business,Warm home discount scheme: the key questions answered,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/02/warm-home-discount-scheme-the-key-questions-answered
2/2/2022,"The Russian threat to Ukraine may be the first major foreign policy crisis since Brexit in which the UK can play to its strengths, and show that Britain with its military muscle is not turning into the global irrelevance that many had predicted. That at least is the hope in parts of Whitehall. The two other big post-Brexit foreign policy moments – the withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the announcement of the Aukus security partnership in the Indo-Pacific – did not exactly see Britain in the cockpit in the same way. The UK departed from Afghanistan under US duress and then executed that withdrawal so chaotically that it cost Dominic Raab his foreign secretaryship. Aukus was largely a US-Australian deal, even if puts the UK in a potentially leading role in the Indo-Pacific in future.  But the Ukraine crisis is a different test, and one that the UK’s extensive diplomatic network dare not fail if it is to prove that outside the EU bloc, the UK has acquired a new foreign policy agility. At a personal level, Boris Johnson also hopes Ukraine will be his deus ex machina, a moment to prove to his sceptical backbenchers that he can show statesmanship and, more cynically, to shame the media into ending its “trivial obsessions” with “partygate”. As a result many of the recent Downing Street briefings prepared for the Sunday papers have had a somewhat desperate quality to them, portraying Johnson as being at the centre of grave, fast-moving world events. This contrasts with the harsher reality of scheduled calls to Vladimir Putin being cancelled because Johnson was detained by MPs asking him if they were fools to have complied with the Covid rules that he had set. The Russian president was never likely to see Johnson as an important interlocutor in the same league as the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Putin can also detect weakness in his opponents, and as soon as he sees a man is down, his first instinct is to kick as hard as he can. The call has now been rescheduled, but it is an embarrassing episode. It was also a bad stroke of luck that Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, was struck by Covid just before she headed on a diplomatic tour of eastern Europe. But that is not the whole picture or a fair description of how active the UK has been throughout the crisis. Britain has a clear-eyed sense of the issues at stake – the defence of the security architecture stuck in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union, all set out in the widely praised article by the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, debunking Putin’s claims about Ukraine’s historic origins. The UK also has a deep, long-standing military connection with Ukraine – confirmed last year in a new strategic partnership upon which it is now building through the provision of next generation anti-tank weapons. Through Chatham House there has been a steady flow of exchanges with Ukraine’s leading figures, covering energy, civil society and banking, going back a decade. The UK now hopes that military alliance with Ukraine can be extended by drawing in another close British ally, Poland – an idea enthusiastically endorsed by the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki. It may even prove to be a way of drawing Ukraine closer to an informal security alliance with Nato partners without actually joining Nato itself – something which is off the table for the foreseeable future anyway. It would represent a balance to the Weimar Triangle, the much older alliance between Germany, France and Poland. All that helps to make Johnson a priority in Kyiv as European premiers jostle to fly into Ukraine. But there is a bigger prize for the UK. If it plays its cards right, It can re-establish itself as the undisputed No 1 ally of the US. UK intelligence services are working in lockstep with Washington, for instance over claims of a Russian inspired coup. Some reports suggest the US handed the UK the intelligence evidence to allow Truss to unmask the alleged plotters. Equally, British and US assessment of the high likelihood of an invasion is largely pitched at the same level. Britain’s leading cyber-experts have been flying to Washington to discuss what counter-measures can be prepared. Johnson has not been averse to reminding Washington of the UK’s reliability by chastising his former EU rivals France and Germany. Doubtless echoing what his diplomats were hearing in Washington, Johnson has warned Macron not to seek to exploit the crisis to promote his project of European strategic autonomy. Germany, he and Truss now repeatedly say, is too dependent on Russian gas, an analysis shared on a bipartisan basis by many in the US Congress. For a variety of historic and geographical reasons Germany was always going to end up the outlier in this crisis, but none of this is helped by a new coalition government still bedding in. It has even led the UK Foreign Office to lobby Washington to ask for an expansion of the Normandy format, from which the UK and the US are currently excluded. As the key forum in which the status of eastern Ukraine is discussed with Russia, Britain deeply regrets its self-exclusion. Above all, UK diplomats, along with the Ministry of Defence are trying to make themselves useful by using its influence in its network of former allies inside the EU, including in the Baltic states and eastern Europe. The Baltic states need no persuading about the Russian threat, and are privately, and sometimes in public, frustrated with Germany’s refusal to let them give Ukraine weaponry of German origin. More UK troops will go to Estonia if Nato requests. But Wallace is also putting in the air miles touring the EU countries where the UK message on the Russian threat faces a tougher reception: Slovakia, Hungary and Croatia. On Monday, Wallace – currently top of a cabinet league table monthly members’ poll on the ConservativeHome website – made little progress in Budapest with the Hungarian defence secretary who, at a joint press conference, said he opposed sanctions on Russia or more Nato troops in his country. On Tuesday, Wallace popped up in Croatia. Johnson has also been on the phone to Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey, a Nato member and potential wild card. There is of course one problem with all this frenetic activity and with the policy towards Moscow: Britain’s lax approach to Russian oligarchs based in the UK. It is now out there as a drag anchor on everything the UK seeks to do internationally about Russia. The shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, was correct on Monday when he said that report and after report has been published highlighting this problem, and yet the government has refused to act. None of the measures announced this week by the Foreign Office will be implemented unless an invasion occurs, so the basic problem remains untouched. With Joe Biden making the fight against corruption one of his big themes, it was inevitable that Washington was going to lose patience with the UK’s sloth.",News/Politics,Ukraine crisis a test that Britain – and Johnson – dare not fail,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/02/ukraine-crisis-a-test-that-britain-and-johnson-dare-not-fail
2/2/2022,"Absurd as it seems, and resist it though we may, the universe continues to insist that the 90s were 30 years ago instead of 10 minutes. Thus, we are increasingly confronted by dramas that take the headlines of our youths and examine them as the pivotal moments of history they in fact were. At least they are not (quite yet) ancient enough to be treated with reverence or mystification. We 70s babies are still not Stonehenge, or the ruins of Herculaneum. But the bouncily interrogative spirit of the king of the genre, Ryan Murphy (who has dramatised the OJ Simpson case, the killing of Gianni Versace and the Clinton-Lewinsky affair) still seems to be setting the tone for those who follow in his train.  Pam & Tommy (Disney+), adapted from the article by Amanda Chicago Lewis, disinters the sex tape scandal that engulfed the celebrity couple of the mid-90s. The Baywatch star and international sex symbol (to give what was then her full official title), Pamela Anderson, and Mötley Crüe drummer, Tommy Lee, had become even greater than the sum of their parts (and Lee’s part in particular was already legendary – and about to become more so) by getting married four days after meeting each other. Robert Siegel’s eight-part miniseries looks at what happened to the couple after a private tape of them having sex on their honeymoon went (for the first time thanks to the power of the then-infant internet) very, very public. The series is really three narratives plaited together. The first – to which the opening episode is dedicated, though we return to it throughout – is a heist caper, true even in its most incredible details. Rand Gauthier (Seth Rogen) is a contractor fired, unpaid, by the capricious Lee for supposedly shoddy work, who takes revenge by stealing the safe from the rock star’s garage. He evades the security guards and cameras by using a furry rug to disguise himself as a large dog. Inside the safe he finds various weapons, cash, and an unmarked Hi8 video cassette, which he takes to his friend, a porn director played by Nick Offerman. “Looking for work?” he asks Rand. “Carpentry? Anal?” When they see what’s on it, the stage is set. It’s a fun opener – as it were – but doesn’t showcase what will become a warm, funny, intelligent and rather moving drama, with astonishing performances from Lily James as Anderson and Sebastian Stan as Lee. They each achieve the feat of uncannily resembling – aesthetically, vocally, and in every mannerism – the real-life people, without descending into mimicry. The series moves back and forth in time as the second and third narratives come into play. There’s the love story – as unconventional as all get out, sure, but showing what the pair found in each other (beyond, yes, the obvious), and how, even if a split was probably inevitable, their relationship was put under unprecedented pressure when the tape went public. The third strand is the one that virtually defines the genre: a critique of the media machinations, public appetite and systemic legal biases at that particular time, which enabled the events to unfold as they did. And, as ever, we can see the misogyny that infused everything, and here made sure Anderson bore the brunt of the humiliation and damage to herself and her career. There is a particularly brutal scene in which she is deposed by a lawyer who seems out to degrade her as thoroughly as possible. But there is a whole web of lesser moments (on the Baywatch set, during personal appearances, in her Playboy shoots), when she is at the whim of the men in charge. The sight of the 90s image of Anderson, and the scandal being reconsidered in line with modern and more enlightened mores (imperfect though they still are) is a welcome one. But, this is undermined by the fact that the whole enterprise has been undertaken without her approval. Ironically, it is the very alertness and compassion of the thing that – assuming she saw the script or was given an idea of the tone – makes you think how very much she must have wanted, whatever the take on it was to be, the entire subject to be left alone.",Arts/Television & radio,Pam & Tommy review – the infamous sex tape’s astonishing story,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/02/pam-tommy-review-sex-tape-compassion-fun-90s-scandal-fallout
2/2/2022,"Invasion. Disease. Death. The 16th-century Europeans arriving in Peru brought with them all manner of havoc and destruction. But they did not only pillage the living. They also looted graves.  Now researchers say local people came up with a somewhat macabre response to restore disturbed remains – by threading spines on to sticks. “The idea is that when [the Europeans were looting], they have to go through textile bundles that have these bodies, and so they’re ripping textile bundles, and taking out the gold and silver, and bodies are coming apart,” said Dr Jacob Bongers from the University of East Anglia, lead author of the study. “Then local peoples, Chincha peoples, are coming back, seeing this, and trying to put their dead back together.” The Chincha were a very wealthy society of at least 30,000 people that included fishers and farmers, with Spanish reports suggesting they were known for their sea-faring merchants. Writing in the journal Antiquity, Bongers and colleagues report how they encountered human vertebrae carefully threaded on to reed posts while exploring mortuary sites in the Chincha valley of Peru in 2013, an area in which the Chincha kingdom flourished until the 15th century when it was incorporated into the Inca empire. At first, Bongers said, he thought the sticks were created by the looters. But as more and more vertebrae-threaded posts were found – with almost 200 reported so far – he realised that was unlikely to be the case, adding their association with disturbed textile bundles also suggested there could be a different story. The study reveals that the threaded vertebrae were found inside or outside large elaborate tombs known as chullpas, often on the surface, while the practice was applied to the remains of adults and juveniles. Radiocarbon dating of three reeds and their associated vertebrae, combined with modelling and analysis, suggests the individuals probably died between 1520 and 1550, a period consistent with epidemics and famines in Peru, Bongers added. The reeds were harvested to make the posts a little later, between 1550 and 1590. “The reed dates [are] approximately when the Europeans would have been in Chincha, and when they would have been looting these tombs,” said Bongers. The team say their hypothesis is supported by the finding that the vertebrae were often threaded on to the reeds out of their anatomical order, and were already separated from each other when the threaded posts were created. “That’s why the vertebrae are not in order: because they were scattered,” said Bongers. Bongers said the study showed that even though the body parts are no longer biologically living, they continue to have social lives. “Death was not the end here,” he said. “What we are seeing here is long-term engagement with the dead. European colonialism is not stopping local people from interacting with the dead.” Prof Bill Sillar, an expert in Andean archaeology from University College London, who was not involved in the work, said the dating in the study was convincing, noting that finding that the remains had deteriorated before the threaded vertebrae were constructed showed this took place some time after death. But he added that while it is plausible the action was a response to colonial looting, there could be other explanations, as many Andean societies revisited the remains of their dead – including Inca society, which periodically brought out their mummies and gave them drinks before returning them to their tombs. “While I think it is quite reasonable to think the vertebrae were restrung and mummies reconstructed as a response to colonial interventions,” Sillar said, “I could also see it as equally plausible that this practice emerged as an aspect of Andean mortuary ritual before the Spanish intervened.”",News/Science,"Native Peruvians threaded corpses’ spines on to sticks, study suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/02/native-peruvians-threaded-corpses-spines-on-to-sticks-study-suggests

2/2/2022,"Plants are flowering a month earlier in the UK as the climate heats up, a study has found. The researchers examined 420,000 recorded dates of first flowering for more than 400 species, dating to 1793. The average date for the first blooms was about 12 May up to 1986, but since then the date has been pushed forward to 16 April.  Herbaceous plants saw the biggest advance, producing flowers an average of 32 days earlier. Trees blossomed 14 days sooner and shrubs advanced by 10 days. The researchers think faster-reproducing herbaceous plants can more easily adapt to the warming climate. During the most recent recorded year, 2019, spring arrived 42 days earlier than the pre-1986 average. The difference between flowering times in the north of the UK, above Stoke-on-Trent, and the south has shrunk from nine days before 1986 to four days afterwards. In the period after the mid-80s there has been accelerated global heating caused by fossil-fuel-burning and other human activities. “The results are truly alarming, because of the ecological risks associated with earlier flowering times,” said Prof Ulf Büntgen, at the University of Cambridge, who led the research. “When plants flower too early, a late frost can kill them – a phenomenon that most gardeners will have experienced at some point.” But the even bigger risk is “ecological mismatch”, he said, when plants and hibernating or migrating insects, birds and other wildlife are no longer synchronised. “That can lead species to collapse if they can’t adapt quickly enough.” Such mismatches are already being seen, for example, between orchids and bees and great tit chicks and their crucial caterpillar food. The researchers concluded that if plants in the UK continued to flower earlier, and climatic extremes increased further, then “biological, ecological and agricultural systems will be at an unprecedented risk”. Farmers could suffer, for example, if fruit trees were flowering early and then a late frost killed the entire crop. While it could be difficult for people to see the significance of average global warming of 1C, Büntgen said, plants flowering a month early showed a clear change. “It is not abstract anymore. We all have a feeling for a month, particularly if you have to wait for your next salary payment,” he said. The study, published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B journal, examined first flowering dates from the Channel Islands to Shetland, and from Northern Ireland to Suffolk. The study did not highlight specific species, because the data available for individual plants were very variable over time and in geographic coverage. “You have to be very cautious,” said Büntgen. But the study did note that there were now hundreds of records of snowdrops and hellebores flowering before New Year’s Day and dozens of such records for primroses, winter aconites and lesser celandines. The scientists found that the earlier flowering dates correlated strongly with the average daily maximum temperature from January to April, which rose from 7.8C from 1952-1986 to 8.9C from 1987-2019. The researchers did not find a link with the length of the day, but they said this cue used by plants might become important if average flowering dates are brought forward into February in the future. The researchers found that their data showed flowering had advanced by 15 days more than the UK Spring Index used by the government, which includes only two species, hawthorn and horse chestnut. John David, at the Royal Horticultural Society, said: “The main focus of this study is on native plants and so we don’t yet have a clear picture of the full impact of these changes on garden plants, but we would expect a similar pattern and have seen indications of this in our own gardens, such as the apple flowering times in our orchard at Wisley.” “The UK’s 30 million gardeners have an important role to play therefore in supporting our native biodiversity and counteracting the effects of any mismatch between flowering times and dependent wildlife. Our Plants for Bugs research, for example, shows what plants you can grow that will support biodiversity all year round.” The flowering date records used in the study come from Nature’s Calendar, a collection of 3.5m observations of seasonal change and maintained by the Woodland Trust and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. Many of the records are provided by citizen scientists and anyone in the UK can submit data. “It is the world’s largest dataset and it’s superb, but it’s not enough,” said Büntgen, who called for more people to participate. “Updating the dataset every year is extremely valuable, because this is the only tool we have to really understand how climate is affecting our ecosystems. This is not something we can model.”",News/Environment,Flowers arriving a month early in UK as climate heats up,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/02/flowers-arriving-month-early-uk-climate-heats-up-bloom-insects-birds
2/2/2022,"Some of the wealthiest parts of England, including areas represented by government ministers, have so far been allocated 10 times more money per capita than the poorest under Boris Johnson’s “levelling up” agenda, Guardian analysis has found. Michael Gove, the communities secretary, will announce on Wednesday new measures designed to end what the prime minister has called the “outrage” of regional inequalities.  But analysis of the £4.7bn allocated under the levelling up agenda to date shows how some of England’s most deprived areas are receiving far less support than some of the richest boroughs. A further £1.8bn is still to be announced. Sajid Javid’s constituency, Bromsgrove in Worcestershire, will receive nearly £15m – £148 a head – despite being one of the wealthiest areas in England. Mid Bedfordshire, an area partly represented by the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, has received £26.7m – £91 a head – from the Levelling Up Fund despite being one of the fifth most affluent areas of the country. In contrast, eight local authorities that are among the poorest in England have received less than £10 a head from the four funds announced to date. These include Swale in Kent; Tendring in Essex; Barking and Dagenham; Southampton; and Knowsley in Merseyside. The analysis brings together the four main levelling up funds for the first time. The Future High Streets Fund, the Community Renewal Fund and the Towns Fund have been fully allocated, while the levelling up fund has allocated £1.4bn with a further £1.8bn still to be announced. A total of £4.7bn has been allocated in England across the four schemes so far. Jonathan Webb, a senior research fellow at the thinktank IPPR North, said: “This new analysis from the Guardian demonstrates the gap between the rhetoric and the reality of levelling up. “Forcing local areas to bid for centrally controlled pots of money is resulting in an opaque and unfair allocation of already limited resources, as this analysis shows. The fact some of the most deprived local authorities have received no money from any of the government’s four main levelling up funds is unacceptable and will only widen the UK’s existing regional divides.” The Commons public accounts committee, which scrutinises government spending, has ordered Gove’s department to provide more information about how its funding decisions were taken amid concerns about a lack of clarity and transparency from ministers and officials. Other relatively affluent areas that have received much larger awards than poorer areas include Lewes in East Sussex (£443 a head), South Derbyshire (£229) and South Ribble in Lancashire (£226).  The analysis is based on four funds: the Levelling Up Fund, the Towns Fund, the Future High Streets Fund and the Community Renewal Fund. If the funding was announced at upper-tier or combined authority level it was reallocated to the appropriate lower-tier local authority. In instances where the funding was split over more than one local authority the funding was divided by the number of relevant authorities, unless it was clearly going to one specific area.Population figures used are 2020 ONS mid-year estimates, and deprivation data was taken from the Indices of Multiple Deprivation 2019. IMD figures were used to divide areas into quintiles based on deprivation. Buckinghamshire, North Northamptonshire and West Northamptonshire have been excluded due to recent boundary changes. Isles of Scilly and City of London were excluded due to low population.  Many areas of high deprivation have also received large payouts. Copeland and Barrow-in-Furness, which are both among the most deprived 40% of councils nationally, will receive more than £600 a head – the largest per capita awards. But Southampton and Knowsley, both among the most deprived fifth of councils, have so far received nothing from the four funds. The Merseyside borough of Knowsley, the third poorest local authority in England, has been rejected by three of the funds despite being identified by the government as a top priority for investment. It was named on Tuesday as one of the government’s “educational investment areas” to be outlined in the white paper, however. Graham Morgan, the Labour leader of Knowsley council, said levelling up had been “nothing more than a slogan so far” and suggested the area was being punished because it was a Labour stronghold: “The people who actually work for the government on these schemes can’t find any box which we haven’t ticked. So there is some other reason – a political reason – why Knowsley isn’t getting the support which local people need.” Lisa Nandy MP, the shadow levelling up secretary, said: “For all the talk of levelling up, we have been completely short-changed. Ministers are hiding behind process, refusing to come clean on how these decisions around funding are being made. People are struggling to keep their heads above the water with rising costs, rising bills and rising taxes.” The government said it had assessed data on deprivation, need for regeneration, impact of Brexit, transport infrastructure and other indicators to decide which areas should get funding. It said local authorities that were wealthier on average would often contain pockets of deprivation and that urban areas with metro mayors may have benefited from separate government funding streams. But Henri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, a regional economic thinktank, said: “This analysis shows the government has allocated money without enough regard to the high levels of economic disadvantage in many parts of the country – this seriously undermines their professed commitment to levelling up.” Murison said Johnson’s government was planning to spend less on English regional development than Theresa May or David Cameron’s governments and that true levelling up would need long-term financial backing form the chancellor, Rishi Sunak. A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said the analysis was misleading because it “ignores the billions of pounds of levelling up funding that will be allocated in the coming months, and the huge amount of work taking place across government to level up the UK”. They added: “Levelling up is more than one grant – it’s a massively ambitious, generation-defining project that includes the largest shift of power from Whitehall to local leaders in modern times alongside innovative new policies to end the postcode lottery and shift focus and resources to Britain’s forgotten communities.”",News/Inequality,‘Levelling-up’ funding inequality exposed by Guardian research,https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2022/feb/02/levelling-up-funding-inequality-exposed-by-guardian-research
2/2/2022,"The family of an England rugby player locked down in a care home have voiced “pure despair” at new visiting rules which mean thousands of care residents will continue to be denied contact with loved ones. Kate Skillen, whose father, David Robinson, was a flanker in a county team that beat the New Zealand All Blacks in 1972 and toured Japan with England in 1971, said her family feel helpless that despite a pledge from the government to return to “unlimited visiting” from this week, rolling Covid outbreaks mean they cannot see him. Their last visit was on Christmas Day.  Robinson, 77, who later became a dairy farmer, has dementia and lives in a care home in Cockermouth, Cumbria. He is one of tens of thousands of care home residents in England who remain locked down because of the spread of Omicron. Under new guidance published on Monday which lifts restrictions on the number of people who can visit in care homes, settings where two or more staff or residents test positive for Covid must still stop all indoor visiting for 14 days, except at the end of life or if a visitor has been granted “essential care giver status”. It means he is denied face to face visits with his three daughters, Beth, Anna and Kate, and seven grandchildren, including Hetty, three. The new government guidance states: “We expect and encourage providers to facilitate visits wherever possible, and to do so in a risk-managed way.” But the Rights for Residents campaign group said the continued restrictions on care visits into homes with outbreaks meant the restrictions were not a meaningful easing. “It is a continuation of draconian lockdown measures, isolating our loved ones at a time in life when they need families and friends – it’s a disgrace,” the organisation said. Up to 70% of the 165 homes operated by Four Seasons Health Care, one of the UK’s largest private operators, are currently closed to most visitors because of positive tests. 534 care homes in England reported Covid outbreaks to the UK Health Security Agency in the third week of January. Jeremy Richardson, chief executive of Four Seasons, said he wants the government to change the definition of an outbreak “because the consequences of infection are dramatically different now”. Covid deaths in England’s care homes are running at about 200 a week, nine times lower than the peak of the wave in January 2021. “We have been told that visiting remains restricted and there appears to be a rolling outbreak,” said Skillen. “My dad still knows us, he is overcome with emotion when he sees us and repeatedly tells us he loves us and kisses us when we see him, gripping our hands. It is very upsetting and I can only hope and pray he doesn’t just think we’ve abandoned him.” A quarantine period of 10 days is also still required after emergency hospital stays, which is discriminatory and deeply damaging to older people’s wellbeing according to Helen Wildbore, director of the Residents and Relatives Association. “Six months after so-called ‘freedom day’, guidance on visiting in care homes still contains the most damaging restrictions on people’s movement and contact,” she said. “The government has ignored calls from the sector – even from care providers – to amend the definition of an outbreak which is leading to harmful isolation periods often rolling on for several weeks if more cases are detected.” The Department of Health and Social Care has been approached for comment.",News/Society,Family of England rugby player voice ‘pure despair’ at care home visiting rules,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/02/family-of-england-rugby-player-voice-pure-despair-at-care-home-visiting-rules
2/2/2022,"Lala likes to think of herself as pretty unshockable. On her popular Instagram account @lalalaletmeexplain, she dishes out anonymous sex and dating advice on everything from orgasms to the etiquette of sending nude pictures. Nor is the 40-year-old sex educator and former social worker (Lala is a pseudonym) shy of sharing her own dating experiences as a single woman. But even she was perturbed by a recent question, from a woman with a seven-year-old daughter who had caught her new partner watching “stepdaughter” porn involving teenage girls. Was that a red flag?  Given her professional training, the story set Lala’s alarm bells ringing. “To me, you can’t take these risks – things like that I’m willing to die on a hill for,” she says. So she was taken aback by some of the comments on her Instagram account, where she asks her 175,000 followers to respond to other people’s dilemmas. “There were people on that post saying: “What people watch in porn is not what they do in real life; how can you be so judgmental?’” The idea that nobody should be judged for their sexual desires lies at the heart of so-called “sex-positive feminism”, the credo that stripping away the stigma historically surrounding female sexuality will liberate women to enjoy themselves without guilt or shame and help to eliminate the slut-shaming and victim-blaming that often stops violence against women being taken seriously. The movement is credited with shattering taboos around issues such as masturbation, periods, LGBT rights and female genital mutilation, thanks to its insistence on women’s right to sexual pleasure. From the gleeful exhibitionism of Love Island contestants to Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion’s exuberant sex-positive anthem Wet Ass Pussy, the idea that enjoying sex is nothing to be ashamed of – in theory at least, if not always in practice – has filtered into young women’s everyday lives. But if sex-positive feminism champions women pursuing their own desires without feeling judged, it also demands that they refrain from judging the way other people have sex – at least between consenting adults. Now, some are questioning who this free-for-all really serves and how consent is defined, in a society where women are still heavily conditioned to please men. In her book Block, Delete, Move On, published this month, Lala writes of her gratitude to those who fought for women’s right to enjoy sex – however and whenever they want – and her refusal to be judged on the number of people she has slept with. But, while the endless supply of potential hook-ups provided by dating apps has been great for women who just want casual sex, she argues, it has downsides for those seeking long-term relationships. “Since sex has become easier to get,” she writes, “love has become harder to find.” Through her Instagram account and the dating column she writes for OK! magazine, she hears regularly from women tolerating activities they don’t enjoy in bed for fear of being rejected for someone more willing – an age-old story, except that those sexual norms are now set by pornography. “Sexual liberation is great, but in some ways we ran with that, and then ended up in a model of sex that has been created by men,” says Lala. “We have got the part where it’s: ‘You can do this without judgment, you don’t have to be married or worry about unintended pregnancies!’ but we’re not balancing that with the education or that sense of what sex really is – how should it feel, when should you do it, how should you do it?” When Lala polled her Instagram followers recently, almost three quarters said they had experienced rough or painful sex but had chosen not to complain about it. “It’s like: ‘I don’t want to disappoint him, I don’t want to be bad in bed.’ If you really like someone but every time you have sex it hurts and you don’t want that, how do you negotiate that when you’re only 18?” For all her professional expertise, she says, she remembers some “pretty horrible sex” when she was younger. In December, the singer Billie Eilish, then 19, declared that watching porn from the age of 11 had “destroyed” her brain. At first it made her feel like “one of the guys”, she told the Howard Stern radio show in the US, but now she thinks it twisted her expectations: “The first few times I, you know, had sex, I was not saying no to things that were not good. It was because I thought that’s what I was supposed to be attracted to.” On Twitter, self-proclaimed sex-positive feminists accused her of being “anti-choice”, or stigmatising women who work in porn, while the #BillieEilish hashtag attracted images of topless models with her head crudely photoshopped on to them, and lurid boasts from men of what they’d like to do to her. But Eilish is not alone in questioning the way porn tropes have coloured everyday relationships. Generation Z is the most sexually fluid generation yet – only 54% of its members define themselves as exclusively attracted to members of the opposite sex, compared with 81% of baby boomers – and is arguably the most adventurous. More than one in 10 teenagers claim to have had anal sex by the age of 18, according to the UK’s authoritative National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles, which also found under-24s almost as likely as middle-aged people to have had more than 10 partners, despite being sexually active for many fewer years. But the generation most likely to have its first sexual experience via a phone screen seems increasingly willing to question what that means for individuals’ lives. A third of British women under 40 have experienced unwanted slapping, spitting, choking or gagging in bed, according to research carried out for the pressure group We Can’t Consent to This, which campaigns to limit the so-called “rough sex” defence for murder (used by men who killed their partners to argue that the women died accidentally, in consensual sex games). It is one of a string of recent grassroots campaigns led by young women against tech-enabled forms of sexual aggression, from the unsolicited sending of “dick pics” to sharing intimate photos online. While women who enjoy rough sex have an absolute right to pursue it without shame, Lala argues, the normalisation of pain in porn may provide cover for some abusive men, and make women feel prudish for refusing potentially dangerous acts like choking. “A lot of young men have co-opted BDSM [bondage, discipline or domination, sadism and masochism]. They’re not into power plays and consent. They just like hurting women.” Anna-Louise Adams was in her early 20s, and at university in London, when she experienced a handful of casual sexual encounters that turned rough without warning. “It was quite forceful hair pulling, and spanking – stuff that, I suppose, you would see in porn and seems quite generic, but you would expect a conversation to be had before it happened,” she says on the phone from Birmingham, where she is completing a master’s in sociology. Luckily, she says, she was confident enough to object. “But I did find it quite shocking, and it did deter me from having sex for probably about a year. I’d had two or three experiences of varying degrees of extremity and I just thought: ‘what’s the point of this?’” she says. “I’d come to my own conclusions about sex that wasn’t in a relationship, at least. I feel quite sad for my younger self, really.” Now 25, and having compared notes with friends who had similar experiences, she no longer thinks it relevant that the encounters that turned sour were casual ones. “I’ve heard about plenty of relationships where it’s happened, and happened unexpectedly.” Speaking publicly for the We Can’t Consent to This campaign has, she says, also helped to channel her feelings into something constructive. Some might say sex positivity has benefited women such as Adams, giving them the confidence to set boundaries in bed and discuss their experiences openly. But she is unconvinced. “It doesn’t benefit women. Even if there are individuals who feel personally empowered, collectively it continues to oppress us,” she says. “It’s all well and good saying that we can have sex now without being shamed and victim blamed. But it’s not like that’s being translated into real life.” The sense that the revolution hasn’t lived up to its idealistic promises may be fuelling resistance. Louise Perry, press officer for We Can’t Consent to This and author of The Case Against the Sexual Revolution, due to be published this summer, argues that a movement originally meant to liberate women is being hijacked to serve men’s interests. Perry, 29, held the same liberal views in her early 20s as “most other millennial urban graduates in the west”, about issues such as porn, hook-up culture, or BDSM, but began questioning them after a stint working in a rape crisis centre. “I’m not anti the sexual revolution per se – I don’t want to go back to having 10 children, or whatever would have been in store without the pill,” she says. “But I think the beneficiaries [of sex-positive feminism] overwhelmingly have been a certain subset of men.” The problem isn’t just porn, she argues, but dating apps inadvertently making men less accountable for abusive behaviour. “I’ve spoken to women who have dated men from apps and have been sexually assaulted, then find he’s deleted his profile and they don’t even know his username – that’s the sort of thing that really, really serves the interests of men.” While there’s little evidence of singletons deleting apps en masse, the suspension of dating during the pandemic may have pushed some to rethink what they’re looking for. The dating app OKCupid reported a rise in the number of British users seeking a long-term relationship after the 2020 lockdown while in the US, Match.com’s annual Singles in America report last year found that only 11% of users claim to be seeking casual flings, with qualities such as trust and emotional maturity now prized over physical attractiveness. If only temporarily, the loneliness and insecurity of lockdown may have made cosy coupledom look more appealing. Yet the idea that sex-positive feminism is “falling out of fashion”, as the New York Times writer Michelle Goldberg argued, may seem regressive to some people. After all, it was never meant to be about just saying “yes” to everything. Indeed, some sex-positive activists are defined by actively not wanting sex, such as the lingerie model Yasmin Benoit, who identifies as asexual or ace – meaning that she never or rarely experiences attraction to others – but maintains she is not anti-sex just because she isn’t interested, personally. And, historically, sex positivity is rooted in efforts to tackle sexual violence, via protests such as the “Slut Walks” movement of the past decade, where women marched, stripped to their bras, to project the message that nobody is “asking for it” by the way they dress. Contentiously, for Generation Z in particular, while sex positivity is frequently associated with liberal-left views or support for trans rights, the backlash against it has become associated – not always fairly – with both rightwing media and gender-critical views. (The foreword to Perry’s book is by Prof Kathleen Stock, the academic who resigned from the University of Sussex last year, after protests against her views on trans rights.) “I think we’re on the edge of a real anti-sex backlash,” says the activist and writer Laurie Penny, author of Sexual Revolution: Modern Fascism and the Feminist Fightback, who points out that destigmatising sex has freed women to talk about what were once taboo subjects. “A culture where sex is stigmatised is also one where we can’t talk about any of those things and I don’t believe there’s anything progressive about a society that wants to control or limit women’s sexuality.” Penny, who uses they/them pronouns, also thinks some attacks on sex-positive feminism – such as that it means porn is beyond criticism – are fights with straw men. “There’s a brilliant quote from [the porn star] Stoya, which says that trying to learn about sex from watching porn is like trying to learn to drive from watching monster truck videos. The thing is I don’t often see that argument made, that you’re not allowed to criticise pornography,” they say. But Penny agrees the “sex-positive” label is becoming outdated in a culture where old constraints on sexual behaviour are gone but the threat of male violence endures. “In this apparently sexually liberated culture, women still don’t feel able to have boundaries and say what they want, and everything is dictated by what men feel they’re supposed to want. I don’t think the problem is too much sexual liberation, I think it’s not enough. You have to actually deal with sexual violence in order to create substantive sexual liberation.” If there is a backlash under way, it may not mean a return to sexual conservatism. Last year, the hashtag “Cancel P*rn” began spreading on TikTok, with users sharing horror stories of X-rated platforms caught hosting footage of rape and child abuse, or talking about the impact of the sex industry on their own lives. While arguments like this are sometimes dubbed “sex-negative” feminism, negative seems the wrong word for accounts such as @profitfromtrauma, a 23-year-old former escort and “sugar baby” to rich older men who paid her for sex. Now working as a trauma coach, she answers followers’ questions about why – in contrast to some more upbeat sex worker accounts on the platform – she really couldn’t recommend her old career. Yet she comes across as anything but prudish. One of her most popular posts is labelled “How I enjoy my body knowing I’m not a £150 sock to men any more”. The missing element of this half-finished revolution, Lala argues, is a cultural shift in men’s attitudes. “Sex-positive feminism has laid the foundations, it’s given us a platform and a voice and a space to use our voices. But without getting men on board and proper sex education, we’re all going to be on the same old hamster wheel.” That won’t happen overnight, she acknowledges. But she does see glimmers of hope. Recently, she counselled a man who had been choking his girlfriend during sex for years. It was only when the girlfriend mustered the courage to say she didn’t like it that he admitted he didn’t like it, either. They were both, it turned out, going along with what they thought the other one wanted, and each secretly wishing the other would make it stop.",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘It stopped me having sex for a year’: why Generation Z is turning its back on sex-positive feminism,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/02/it-stopped-me-having-sex-for-a-year-why-generation-z-is-turning-its-back-on-sex-positive-feminism
2/2/2022,"Richard Colbeck has defended his decision to attend the Ashes cricket in Hobart instead of a parliamentary Covid inquiry, insisting the aged sector was not in crisis and he continued to work on the Omicron outbreak. The aged care and sport minister told the Senate’s Covid-19 inquiry on Wednesday the aged care sector was performing “extremely well” despite coming under “genuine stress” due to coronavirus.  The hearing also heard the Morrison government did not consider the possibility that PCR testing would be overwhelmed over summer, with officials from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet blaming the states for imposing testing requirements to travel across borders. Guardian Australia last week revealed Colbeck attended the Hobart Test from 14 to 16 January after declining to attend the Covid committee on Friday 14 January – citing the workload of officials battling the Omicron wave. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has said he can “understand the criticism” of Colbeck but backed him for continuing to work on aged care issues. On Wednesday, Colbeck said he stood by the decision to attend the day-night Test because it “would be hypocritical of me not to”. “I made a judgment call. I have no option but to stand by that and take the criticism that comes from it.” Colbeck denied putting his sport portfolio above aged care, insisting he “continued to work on both”. “I wasn’t just at the cricket – I continued to work with officials to manage the issues in aged care,” he said. Colbeck said on 14 January he spent “the predominant part of the day on the aged care outbreak”, including meetings with the head of the vaccine rollout, Lt Gen John Frewen, in the morning to discuss aged care boosters, and with the deputy chief medical officer and head of the aged care advisory group, Prof Michael Kidd, at 3.30pm. “The Test match in Hobart was a significant event for Tasmania, as minister for sport I had to be conscious of that as an issue,” the minister said. “All through that weekend, I continued to work on matters in both portfolios, particularly aged care, even though it was a weekend and I attended the Test match.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Colbeck noted that, despite criticism from Labor, the shadow agriculture minister, Julie Collins, had also attended the Test after leaving Anthony Albanese’s tour of regional Queensland. The Labor senator Katy Gallagher noted on Wednesday that the aged care sector was struggling with outbreaks in half of all facilities with 10,000 cases overall, residents locked down, and the sector suffering workforce shortages. There had been 657 deaths in the sector since July 2021. Colbeck said the sector was performing “extremely well” despite the Omicron outbreak. He cited the fact that in 2020 there were 28,000 Covid cases in Australia, of which 2,051 were in aged care (7.2%), but now of the 1.8m Covid cases, just 10,500 were in aged care (0.58%). Some 89% of aged care residents have had both doses of a vaccine, but just 66% have received their booster despite 99% of centres being visited by teams offering them – meaning 64,600 of the system’s 190,000 residents have not had a booster. Frewen said boosters in aged care lagged due to issues including a lack of consent from residents or carers; residents only receiving their second dose recently and a lack of urgency in some communities due to no outbreaks. Colbeck and health officials could not say how many of the 471 people who have died in aged care since January were boosted, citing a “time lag” in getting data from the states. Despite rollout delays throughout 2021, Australia now had the eighth-highest vaccination rate in the OECD, Frewen said, with 95.6% of the population aged 16 and over having had one dose and 93.5% fully vaccinated. More than 8m boosters have been administered. Frewen said the Indigenous vaccination gap had closed by 12%: some 88% of Indigenous Australians have had a first dose and 75% were fully vaccinated. Earlier, officials from the department of the prime minister revealed that despite the health department commissioning new modelling from the Doherty Institute in December, the government did not anticipate PCR testing delays and inadequate capacity over summer.

Chief health officers had been “zealous” in controlling how rapid antigen tests were used in their states, she said, and health advice still recommended PCR testing as the best option. “The preference was for PCR as a higher standard of testing,” Frame said. “Rapid antigen testing may complement that, but it was not the mainstay.” Frame blamed the states for a surge in demand for PCR testing, noting that “test to travel” requirements had added about 20% to demand. She claimed that had not been anticipated. The head of the Therapeutic Goods Administration, Prof John Skerritt, rejected suggestions the regulator had been “asleep” or “lazy” in the process of approving rapid tests. Skerritt said the TGA gave advice in favour of rapid tests in September and 13 varieties were approved by October. But the decision to wait before recommending their use more widely was “deliberate”, he said, because it “would have been dangerous” to rely on tests with false-positive rates of up to 50% or 60% while Australia was still in the Delta wave. The chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, agreed that rapid tests were “not the best in the Australian context at that time” because of low community transmission. Skerritt said they were a “significant part of the armoury”. In the first week of the government’s limited free RAT program for concession-card holders, some 2.8m free tests were delivered through community pharmacies.",News/Australia news,Richard Colbeck defends skipping aged care Covid inquiry for ‘significant’ Test match in Hobart,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/02/richard-colbeck-defends-skipping-aged-care-covid-inquiry-for-significant-test-match-in-hobart
2/2/2022,"Doctors and surgeons are urging state and federal governments to address a backlog in elective surgeries, but nurses in Victoria say the surgery pause should continue to give an “exhausted workforce” some reprieve. The Australian Medical Association (AMA) and the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (RACS) both supported state governments that postponed elective surgeries to dedicate resources to Covid-19 and prevent virus patients from overwhelming public hospitals. But in a joint statement, the AMA and RACS said: “This approach is increasingly unsustainable.  “An urgent plan is needed to restore reasonable and acceptable access to elective surgery, as well as a long-term funding arrangement to ensure this backlog is cleared,” the statement said. The AMA president, Dr Omar Khorshid, said blanket suspensions of elective surgery should be used only as a last resort. “The fact that these are still happening points to the failure of governments to properly invest in public hospital capacity, as well as a failure to undertake the necessary planning needed to avoid this outcome,” he said. The surgeries cancelled by governments have largely been “category three” surgeries – operations that need to occur within one year or for conditions that may cause pain but aren’t expected to rapidly deteriorate – and some “category two” surgeries, which are conditions causing pain or disability and need to occur within 90 days. The RACS president, Dr Sally Langley, said these surgeries were not “optional”. “For many patients waiting in line in pain to have a critical operation, the delays in surgery can be devastating,” she said. “Further, the lack of screening procedures has resulted in patients presenting with more advanced cancers, and in some cases, it has dramatically altered their prognosis.” The AMA and RACS want elective surgery to resume as a priority in both private and public hospitals so that surgeons can start catching up on missed operations. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning On 7 January the New South Wales government announced non-urgent elective surgery would be suspended. On Tuesday, the premier, Dominic Perrottet, announced that from 7 February, non-urgent elective surgery requiring an overnight stay would return to 75% capacity in private hospitals, and up to 75% of pre-pandemic activity levels at public hospitals in regional and rural NSW where they were able to do so. In Victoria, non-urgent elective surgeries have been suspended until mid-February. The Victorian branch of the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation urged the premier, Daniel Andrews, to maintain the pause as planned, despite growing pressure from doctors and surgeons. The federation’s acting secretary, Paul Gilbert, said the pause had provided a surge workforce that could be redeployed at a time when nurses were exhausted and there were critical shortages in aged care homes especially. “In a crisis, it is smart not to use up all your reserves and private hospital nurses and doctors are a surge workforce under the code brown declaration that may well be needed over the next few weeks.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app Asked about Gilbert’s comments on Wednesday, Andrews said the government would take a cautious approach before announcing anything. But he added: “We think it is possible to resume some services in a staggered way, in a balanced, cautious way, and we’ll make further announcements about that soon. “We’ll make the announcements when we’ve listened, when we’ve got all that feedback and when we have determined how it is we will recommence those services, and nothing will be done that isn’t safe. “It’s not an easy decision, it’s not lightly made to limit the number of services that are offered across the system. We’ll get those services back up and running as fast as we possibly can and, of course, we’ll listen to our workforce when it comes to making those important decisions.” The Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association acting chief executive, Kylie Woolcock, said governments also needed to invest funding into the health system, including for digital transformation, to address the range of care deferred and delayed through the pandemic. While surgeries had been affected, data reported by the Productivity Commission on Tuesday revealed decreasing participation in cancer screenings nationwide throughout the pandemic. “These drops in screening will result in people being diagnosed when cancer is at a more advanced stage, when it is more difficult to treat and result in worse prognoses,” Woolcock said.",News/Australia news,Doctors push to clear Australia’s elective surgery backlog but ‘exhausted’ nurses want pause to continue,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/02/doctors-push-to-clear-australias-elective-surgery-backlog-but-exhausted-nurses-want-pause-to-continue
2/2/2022,"A rapid antigen test manufacturing facility will be established in Melbourne to supply Victoria with millions of kits each year. The state’s premier, Daniel Andrews, on Wednesday announced his government’s partnership with Lumos Diagnostics, which is already manufacturing the kits in the US for Canadian and European markets.  If their kits are approved by Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration, the company plans to produce 1 million tests a month from April and 3 million a month after July. The facility will reach full capacity to manufacture 50 million tests a year by October. “That’s a fantastic outcome,” Andrews said. “We know we’re going to be using these things for quite some time and of course, once you get to that level, there’s always opportunities to grow this even further.” The announcement came as case numbers continued to drop nationwide. Victoria recorded 25 deaths and 14,553 new cases of coronavirus, with the number of active infections in the state almost halving – from nearly 140,000 cases one week ago down to 73,886 on Wednesday. Andrews said the majority of deaths were from previous days and had only recently been reported to authorities. There were 786 Victorians in hospital with the virus, down from 851 on Tuesday. NSW Health recorded 27 more Covid deaths and 11,807 new cases on Tuesday, the lowest number this year apart from Australia Day, when 10,345 cases were recorded. It’s a drop of 1,011 cases on the previous day and a stark contrast to the record high of 91,715 cases on 13 January. Queensland recorded 16 deaths, including a child under the age of 10, and 9,360 new cases. The state’s chief health officer, Dr John Gerrard, said the child who died had a “very serious underlying, rare, inherited medical condition”. Queensland’s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said the news was “absolutely devastating”. “It’s our very sad duty today to have to report our first young child that has passed away due to Covid,” she said on Wednesday. “Can I … please urge families to get their children vaccinated. School goes back next week, we are expecting to see increased numbers of cases.” South Australia recorded 1,723 infections and one death, while Tasmania recorded 666 cases and the Australian Capital Territory 549. Western Australia recorded 17 new local cases and 12 returning from interstate or overseas. Two of the local infections are unlinked to existing clusters and are under investigation. The Northern Territory is yet to release their daily figures. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Despite the drop in cases and new manufacturing deal, Andrews said Victoria would not be cancelling any previously made orders for rapid antigen tests, instead offering to share the kits with other jurisdictions if they were not needed. “We can be more confident and much more positive about the future now that we’ve got that supply chain independence,” he said. He flagged it would not be long until a resumption of non-urgent elective surgery, which has already been announced in NSW. “We think it is possible to resume some services in a staggered way, in a balanced, cautious way, and we’ll make further announcements about that soon,” Andrews said.",News/World news,Victoria announces facility to make rapid Covid tests as Australian hospital numbers fall,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/02/victoria-announces-facility-to-make-rapid-covid-tests-as-australian-hospital-numbers-fall
2/2/2022,"Footsore, we reached the ruins of Metcalf’s House that, until the beginning of the 19th century, was an inn on an old road between Teesdale and Weardale. On this frosty morning, it’s the perfect spot for a sit-down, hands warmed by mugs of flasky tea. It wasn’t difficult to imagine what a welcome sight this place must have been for weary drovers of packhorses that once carried almost everything across these Pennine hills before the advent of railways, decent roads and the internal combustion engine. Now, there is no blaze in the hearth, open to the skies, and the apse-shaped oven built into the wall is full of rubble and ferns. In the inn’s heyday, when it had walls, doors and a roof, the air in these rooms must have been a fug of wood smoke, beer, hot beverages and warm bread.  The forest below us, along Ayhope Beck, was partially wreathed in mist. There is probably no one alive who remembers this view before conifer plantations clothed the hillsides, but the birch, hazel, gorse and alder around Metcalf’s House hint at a pre-forested landscape of heathland. Our route onwards, thankfully all downhill, took us through air scented with the sharp, resinous tang of conifers. In a Scots pine plantation, some wind-thrown trees from past storms had been allowed to slowly subside into the earth: left to their own devices, forests can bury their own casualties under carpets of moss, until fungal decay completes its work and timber rots and crumbles. Winged seeds from cones above sometimes spin down and settle on these mossy seedbeds, elevated above the tangle of brambles, nurturing a new generation of saplings, rooted in decaying remains of fallen giants. We reached the valley bottom and the sweet, humic aroma of a deciduous woodland of lofty, straight-trunked oaks. They must have been among the first trees planted here, by unemployed shipyard workers and miners who were drafted in and housed in barrack huts, to afforest these windswept hillsides during the Depression years of the 1930s. Their names go unrecorded but they deserve to be remembered for this magnificent legacy.
