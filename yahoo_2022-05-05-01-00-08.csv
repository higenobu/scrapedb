Source: Investigators of ""Agenstvo"" with reference to sources Details: Two sources - one of them is in constant contact with the parents of the missing sailors from the ""Moskva"", the other talked to officers of the Black Sea Fleet - claim that two-thirds of the ship's crew might have been conscripts. The first source says there was an approximate number of 300 people, explaining that ""bottle-washer"" sailors were needed"", and that all conscripts of the Russian Navy were divided among [different] ships."" An expert from the Russian Navy, Captain 1st Rank in Reserve, told the publication that the cruiser ""always had and has conscripts"", because ""when we have to perform combat missions, we can't quickly send the conscripts back to their mothers and replace them with contractors."" The Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation has officially recognized the death of one person from ""Moskva"". Another 27 have been declared missing. The ""Agenstvo"" has counted 13 sailors whose relatives reported their disappearance; the relatives of another sailor were told by the commanders that he had died. At least 10 of those 14, according to their parents, were conscripts.

5/5/2022,"STORY: The United States and its NATO allies are continuing to pump weapons into Ukraine,"" Shoigu told a conference of defense ministry officials on day 70 of what Russia calls its special military operation in Ukraine. ""We view any transport of the North Atlantic Alliance arriving on the territory of the country with weapons or materials destined to the Ukrainian army as a target to be destroyed."" Russia's defense ministry said earlier that it had disabled six railway stations in Ukraine used to supply Ukrainian forces with Western-made weapons in the country's east by bombing their power supplies. It was not possible to independently verify the claim, which did not say which Western-made weapons were supplied to Ukrainian forces via those stations. There was no immediate reaction from Kyiv. Russia's Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov was shown at Shoigu's side during the meeting of defense officials. On Monday, the United States said it believed Gerasimov visited Ukraine's eastern Donbas region last week but could not confirm media reports that he was wounded during fighting.",Politics/Reuters Videos,Russia to target vehicles taking weapons to Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-target-vehicles-taking-weapons-152311289.html
5/5/2022,"Newsmax host Grant Stinchfield suggested on Tuesday — without evidence or logic — that future Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson may be responsible for the leak of a draft ruling that would dismantle abortion rights. There’s one very big problem with this theory: Jackson isn’t on the Supreme Court yet. Nor was she on the court when it heard arguments in the case over Mississippi’s abortion restrictions. She isn’t involved in the ruling at all. But in the flurry of speculation over who may have leaked the draft, which Politico published Monday, conservatives have singled out individuals by name even though they have no basis beyond their own speculation. Jackson will be sworn in this summer after Justice Stephen Breyer retires. Stinchfield acknowledged that she’s not a justice yet. But he still posited that she may have hired clerks and they may have started work already. He has no evidence this is true; he’s nonetheless “sure” of it. “I find it suspect that the first leak coming out of the Supreme Court in history comes shortly after Judge Jackson is confirmed,” Stinchfield said, as flagged by Media Matters for America’s Jason Campbell. “I want to know if her law clerks, who I am sure have already been hired, possibly even working at the high court already before her swearing in, have access to these draft decisions.” “She would be my first suspect when it comes to the leak because Ketanji Brown Jackson is a radical left-wing activist, more radical than any other justice in the history of the Supreme Court,” he continued. “I believe she is capable of undermining the court this way.” With zero evidence, Newsmax host says Ketanji Brown Jackson ""would be my first suspect when it comes to the leak"" pic.twitter.com/lUE7J4fmdO — Jason Campbell (@JasonSCampbell) May 4, 2022 It’s little surprise that a conservative host would use this opportunity to go after Jackson, who will be the first Black woman on the Supreme Court in its history. During her confirmation hearings, Republicans repeatedly insisted she held radical views, simply for offenses like being a public defender, backing criminal justice reform within the mainstream and ruling like many other judges. Along with Jackson, some conservatives have suggested that the leak came from the office of Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latina to serve on the Supreme Court, who similarly has been accused of holding extreme views.  The other liberal justices on the Supreme Court, who are white, have not been accused in leak speculation.  Supreme Court opinions and drafts are incredibly closely guarded, which is part of why the leak was such a shock. Typically, the justices hold a preliminary vote on which way they will go, then select one member — Justice Samuel Alito, in this instance — to write the majority opinion.  Drafts of the opinion are then circulated among the justices and their support staff. Changes are lobbied for and made, and ultimately, justices may decide to go with another ruling altogether. As of now, the ruling is not final in this case.  The process does not, however, involve sharing drafts outside the court, so if someone is going to make this claim, they need actual evidence to back it up. Whether Stinchfield believes it or not.

5/5/2022,"(Reuters) -The armed forces of Belarus began sudden large-scale drills on Wednesday to test their combat readiness, the defence ministry of Ukraine's neighbour said. Belarus is a close ally of Russia, which invaded Ukraine in late February immediately after holding joint drills with Minsk which had allowed it to move more forces closer to the Ukrainian border. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"". ""It is planned that the (combat readiness) test will involve the movement of significant numbers of military vehicles, which can slow down traffic on public roads,"" the Belarusian ministry said in a statement. The ministry said the exercise posed no threat to its neighbours or the European community in general. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko spoke to his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Tuesday and the two discussed the Russian operation in Ukraine, among other issues, according to official statements. Areas of Ukraine adjacent to Belarus, including its capital Kyiv, came under Russian assault in the initial stage of the invasion, but now Russia has focused its attacks on Ukraine's eastern and southeastern regions.
