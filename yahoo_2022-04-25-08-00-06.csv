4/25/2022,"One of the unexpected effects of the ongoing pandemic has been a surge in cases of agoraphobia. The condition is now keeping an untold number of Americans trapped inside their own homes, according to Dr. Gary Grosel, chief medical officer for UnitedHealthcare of Ohio. Spring's arrival: Hummingbirds are back in Ohio -- and hungry after long journey ""It's an anxiety disorder,"" Grosel said. ""It's where you really have an excessive fear in different situations that usually leaves someone overwhelmed."" The National Institute of Mental Health defines agoraphobia as ""an anxiety disorder that involves intense fear and anxiety of any place or situation where escape might be difficult."" Some people don't even realize they have agoraphobia, partly because it's a disorder that people can develop at any age. It plagues as many as 2% of adults and adolescents nationwide. ""It's more common among women,"" Grosel said. ""Usually less than age 35."" People who have developed the disorder become afraid that something mysterious might just come at them at any second. Usually the fear of attack comes upon them when they are outside of the home, such as with strangers in a bus, in an airplane or in any crowded space.

The disorder entraps people because seeking help flares up symptoms and leads to a new attack. Agoraphobia can grow from an existing anxiety disorder, or it can come about all on its own. Statistics show that about one-third of people who have a panic disorder are at risk of becoming agoraphobic. The disorder typically flares up after a stressful life event, such as a sexual assault or a death in the family — events tend to take place outside of the patient's home. Planting season: Frost-free date coming early this year on May 2 ""If it occurred at a park, they might avoid areas with trees or something like that,"" Grosel said. ""It's irrational behavior."" The doctor said it's important for people to understand that they can develop agoraphobia at any age, so nobody should assume they can't get it. Anyone who thinks they might have developed agoraphobia is urged to talk to a medical professional about the possibility as soon as possible. ""I would start with a family doctor,"" Grosel said. ""Most family doctors will be able to see the signs and symptoms."" Putting it off and staying at home to avoid people is not a good practice, and can in fact make the situation even worse.

""The more you avoid it, the more it adds to the disorder."" If left untreated, agoraphobia can lead to loneliness, depression and alcoholism. Treatments can begin remotely through telehealth services so that patients can remain in the comfort of their homes, but it's important that they progress to in-person sessions. Some patients receive medication that helps level out the amount of serotonin available to the brain. Other patients visit a therapist who puts them into a relaxed state, then asks questions that cause them to recreate their traumatic experience. More: Student reading scores dropped in pandemic. Here's what's being done to improve skills ""As they help you to manage that, it trains the brain to be able to accept it and eventually get over that,"" Grosel said. Either way, recovery is possible. Options for treatment can be discussed after having an initial conversation with a family doctor, or other primary healthcare provider. ""The main thing is, is it affecting daily activity?"" Grosel said. ""If it is, that's a problem."" ztuggle@gannett.com 419-564-3508 Twitter: @zachtuggle This article originally appeared on Mansfield News Journal: Agoraphobia has left people trapped at home during COVID pandemic",Health/Mansfield News Journal,Doctors detect surge in agoraphobia due to COVID-19,https://news.yahoo.com/doctors-detect-surge-agoraphobia-due-090409165.html
4/25/2022,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — It’s unknown how long a stay will hold off the execution of Richard Bernard Moore — South Carolina's first-ever inmate to be put to death by a firing squad — as his attorneys pursue legal challenges. But the issuance of Moore's death warrant, initially planned to be carried out April 29, has renewed interest in how a state puts in motion its plans to shoot an inmate to death. The method is employed in only a handful of states and has not been used in the U.S. in more than a decade. South Carolina just instituted the firing squad option last year, giving condemned inmates the choice between that and electrocution, prompted by an inability to procure lethal injection drugs. In choosing the firing squad, the 57-year-old Moore said he didn’t concede that either method was legal or constitutional but that he more strongly opposed death by electrocution and only opted for the firing squad because he was required to make a choice. Moore drew the death sentence for the 1999 killing of convenience store clerk James Mahoney in Spartanburg. Planning to rob the store for money to support his cocaine habit, investigators have said that Mahoney pulled a gun, which Moore was able to wrestle away and use to shoot the clerk. A May 13 execution date has also been set for another inmate, Brad Sigmon, although a state judge is examining his legal argument that both electrocution and the firing squad are “barbaric” methods of killing. Only three executions in the United States have been carried out by firing squad since 1976, according to the Washington-based nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center. Moore’s would mark the first since Ronnie Lee Gardner ’s 2010 execution by a five-person firing squad in Utah. WHEN DID THIS PROCESS BEGIN? South Carolina — once home to one of the busiest death chambers in the nation — has been unable to carry out any execution since 2011, an involuntary pause that officials have attributed to the state's inability to procure the trifecta of drugs needed to carry out a lethal injection. Condemned inmates had the choice between injection and electrocution, meaning that opting for the former would in essence leave the state unable to carry out the sentence. For several years, lawmakers have mulled adding the firing squad as an option to approved methods, but debate never advanced. Last year, Democratic Sen. Dick Harpootlian and GOP Sen. Greg Hembree, both of whom previously served as prosecutors, again argued in favor of adding the firing squad option. “The death penalty is going to stay the law here for a while. If it is going to remain, it ought to be humane,” Harpootlian said, positing that the firing squad provided a more humane alternative than electrocution, if executions were to continue in the GOP-dominated state. The measure, which Republican Gov. Henry McMaster signed into law last May, made South Carolina the fourth state in the country to allow use of a firing squad, according to the Washington-based nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center. HOW IS THE EXECUTION CARRIED OUT? Since the bill's passage, the South Carolina Department of Corrections worked at retrofitting its existing death chamber in Columbia — where executions by lethal injection and electrocution have been carried out for more than 30 years — to accommodate the needs of a firing squad. The agency spent $53,600 in state funding on renovations, including the installation of bullet-resistant glass between the death chamber and witnesses, as well as a metal chair into which the inmate will be strapped. They also cut into the brick wall of the chamber to make an aperture through which the three shooters — all volunteer employees from the Corrections Department — will thread their weapons, all loaded with live ammunition. The aperture is 15 feet from the condemned, situated in a corner of the room, according to a memo released last month by the prisons agency. While the inmate will be visible to witnesses, officials said that the shooters and their weapons will not. The electric chair, which officials say cannot be removed from the chamber, will be covered in its spot between the glass wall and the firing squad chair. After an opportunity to make a final statement, the inmate will be strapped into the chair and a hood placed over his head. An execution team member will place a “small aim point” over the inmate's heart. After the warden reads the execution order, officials said the team will fire. The agency has not specified what caliber rifles the volunteer shooters will use, nor details of the “certain qualifications” they will be required to have met. WHO WILL BE THERE TO WITNESS IT? Aside from the state officials in the chamber to carry out the execution, three media witnesses may attend the execution, as well as three witnesses from the victim’s family, according to the Corrections Department. State law also allows religious and legal counsel for the inmate, as well as representatives from law enforcement and local prosecutors. WHAT HAPPENS AFTERWARD? As is standard with all South Carolina executions, a physician will examine the inmate and make a death declaration. A photo released by Corrections officials shows a lipped metal basin underneath the inmate chair, as well as a rectangular box directly behind it, potentially to absorb the gunfire. Immediately thereafter, the witnesses will be escorted from the room and taken to the Corrections headquarters building, where other media will be gathered. Out of sight of the witnesses, the inmate's body is removed from the chamber and taken by the Richland County Coroner's Office for an autopsy before being returned to the inmate's family. ___ Meg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP.",U.S./Associated Press,EXPLAINER: How South Carolina execution firing squad works,https://news.yahoo.com/explainer-south-carolina-execution-firing-125505873.html
4/25/2022,"By Laura Gottesdiener GALEANA, Mexico (Reuters) - Standing atop a windswept hill in northern Mexico, surrounded by dozens of fellow mourners, Mario Escobar prepared to bury his teenage daughter, Debanhi, one of the latest victims of the country's crisis of violence against women. ""We are destroyed inside,"" he said. ""We had so much faith that we would find her alive, but that's not what happened."" The nearly two-week search for the 18-year-old law student who disappeared on April 9 near the northern industrial city of Monterrey has sparked new anguish and outrage over gender violence. In Mexico, an average of 10 women a day are killed, and tens of thousands more are missing. More than one hundred family members, friends, and neighbors joined the funeral in Galeana, Nuevo Leon, the hometown of Debanhi's mother where the family often spent weekends and holidays. Singing hymns as they walked under the hot sun, the mourners carried white balloons and hand-written signs demanding justice for Debanhi. The teenager's body was found on Thursday night submerged in a cistern inside the grounds of a motel near where she was last seen alive. The state attorney general said on Friday that the cause of death was a contusion to the skull and that all lines of investigation were open. At the funeral, Mario Escobar said his daughter's corpse had been ""beaten and strangled."" Her death came amid a spate of disappearances of women in the state of Nuevo Leon. Since the beginning of this year, at least 26 women and girls have disappeared, and six more - including Debanhi - have been found dead after being reported missing.
