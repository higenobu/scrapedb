3/13/2022,"Donald Trump didn’t even speak for an hour during his really in Florence, South Carolina, on Saturday night, but he still managed to lay out a sufficiently terrifying vision of what the United States could look like should he run for and win the presidency in 2024, while cycling through the gamut of right-wing talking points about Ukraine, Biden, and beyond. The former president railed against President Biden’s handling of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and once again failed to condemn Vladimir Putin; he bashed Democrats for advocating for a more humane immigration policy and acknowledging the reality of climate change; and went on an extended rant about the 2020 election, claiming that not only is there evidence the election was rigged (there isn’t), but that the matter is “beyond the standpoint of evidence” (it’s not). “I ran twice, I won twice, and I did much better the second time,” Trump said of the election he lost by over seven million votes.

Trump-L.': How CNN's Jeff Zucker and His Cronies Manipulated the News The takeaway from all of this is what Trump has hinted at repeatedly since he left office: “We may have to run again,” he said to what may have been the loudest applause of the night. The rally was Trump’s first since Russia invaded Ukraine, and he spent the beginning of it recycling several of the points he’s made in recent weeks. He claimed the invasion is Biden’s fault and would have never happened if he was still in office. He wasn’t so harsh on Putin, whom he described as someone who is “driven to put it together.” Trump, again, took credit for the Ukrainian resistance, touting the military assistance sent to the nation during his administration. He did not mention that he delayed said military assistance in an effort to extort Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky into digging up dirt on Biden and family.

He thusly spent plenty of time bashing Democratic policy initiatives. He dismissed the idea that climate change is anything to worry about. “The oceans are going to rise 1/100th of an inch in the next 300 years and it’s going to kill everybody,” he said sarcastically. “It’s going create more oceanfront property, that’s what it’s going to do.” He fear-mongered at length about how “Joe Biden has thrown the gates open to these murderous cartels” across the border, noting how “bloodthirsty criminal gangs” are “torturing and slaughtering hostages,” insinuating you and everyone you love may be next if the Democrats keep control of Congress. He also claimed that Democrats are to blame for empty store shelves, which they aren’t, of course, because store shelves aren’t empty. “This all came out of the stench of the Biden administration,” Trump said.

The stores are half empty. pic.twitter.com/rnMGOHvwtz — Acyn (@Acyn) March 13, 2022 The most terrifying part of Trump’s speech may have been not only his relentless insistence that he won the 2020 election (“It was a fraudulent election and the proof is beyond anybody’s wildest expectation”), but the preview he offered of what another Trump administration might look like, should he win in 2024. He’ll have fashioned a Congress that is far more compliant with his authoritarian impulses than the one he took office with in 2017, and that wouldn’t really have a problem with him deciding, say, that he should be able to just go ahead and get rid of anyone in the executive branch who isn’t sufficiently loyal. “We will pass critical reforms making every executive branch employee fireable by the president of the United States,” Trump said. “The deep state must and will be brought to hell. It’s already happening.” “We will pass critical reforms making every executive branch employee fireable by the president of the United States.

3/13/2022,"By Andrius Sytas VILNIUS (Reuters) - Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte was sworn in on Friday as a member of the Riflemen's Union, a paramilitary volunteer force that supports the police and the army and has seen a surge in applications since Russia invaded Ukraine. Over 2,000 applications to join the force have been received since the conflict began, bringing total numbers to 12,000, about a third of them women, the Union said?. Members of the union receive limited military training within their units and volunteer to help the police or the military as needed in certain functions. Simonyte was one of several hundred who took the oath on Friday in front of parliament, on the anniversary of Lithuania becoming the first Soviet republic to declare independence from the Soviet Union, in 1990. ""I see that many people feel restless now,"" she said. ""Volunteering, for instance with the Riflemen's Union, is one good activity to turn to."" The Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, once ruled from Moscow but now part of NATO and the European Union, have received troop deployments from their Western partners to help protect them, and NATO's eastern border, against any threat from Russia and its close ally Belarus.

3/13/2022,"By Andrew R.C. Marshall ZHOVKVA, Ukraine (Reuters) - Before he left for the front, Ukrainian military reservist Viktor Dudar hugged his wife Oksana and told her not to worry. And every day he was away, fighting the advancing Russian forces, he found time to message or call her. ""I'm alive,"" he wrote once. ""Everything is okay."" Then on March 3, a week after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, the messages stopped. Three days later, Oksana's worst fears were confirmed when a priest and some soldiers arrived at her door. ""They entered the house and said, 'Your husband is a hero,'"" recalled Oksana, 47. ""No other words were needed."" Her husband had died in a hail of Russian rockets. Viktor, 44, who in peacetime was a journalist, is one of perhaps hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers who have died since Russia launched its invasion on Feb. 24. Ukraine says its forces have killed more than 12,000 Russian troops. Russia has confirmed about 500 losses. Neither side has disclosed Ukrainian casualties. During his regular TV addresses, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has awarded the title ""Hero of Ukraine"" to soldiers who have died in action. On Thursday alone, Zelenskiy read out the names of 13 recipients. The United Nations estimates that 1,500 civilians have been killed or injured, with Ukrainian officials predicting a much higher death toll as Russia continues to besiege and bombard their cities. 'WHERE ARE YOU?' Oksana and Viktor Dudar met at university, when he came to her dorm to move some furniture. They made their home in Zhovkva, near the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, and have a 21-year-old daughter, Sofia. Today, still dazed with grief, Oksana sits with Viktor's military badge and beret on her lap, rubbing the badge with fingers made red raw by the cold. As a journalist who specialised in military affairs, Viktor believed a Russian invasion was imminent, said Oksana. Within hours of the attack, he had driven to Lviv to present himself at the headquarters of the 80th Brigade. He had served in the brigade in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and started backing separatists who seized territory in eastern Ukraine. He went straight to the front, Oksana later learned, to Mykolaiv, a strategic port city on the Black Sea. The region was the scene of fierce clashes as Ukrainian soldiers repelled Russian forces sweeping up from Crimea. Back home in Zhovkva, a town untouched by the fighting, Oksana tried to gauge from Viktor's daily messages and fleeting calls where he was and how much danger he was in. He never revealed his exact location, but gave glimpses of his life on the frontline. One night, he slept in a tree. On another occasion, local people cooked hot meals for his unit. He was candid with Oksana, who is also a journalist, about the battle ahead. ""On TV we hear about Ukraine's great wins, about how we're destroying the enemy,"" he told her. ""But it looks like I'll be here for a long time."" Then, on March 3, Viktor went silent. ""Where are you?"" Oksana messaged him that afternoon. ""What's happening to you?"" After his death was confirmed, Viktor's belongings were returned - just his wallet and its contents, nothing more - and then his body. The coffin was sealed. Oksana said she wasn't allowed to look inside. Viktor is buried in Lychakiv Cemetery in Lviv, his grave piled high with flowers. Next to him lie six other soldiers beneath flower-decked mounds. Behind them there is an empty plot, ready for more. Viktor's death has hardened Oksana's resolve. ""After such great losses, after the grief that was brought to our land, we have no choice but to win,"" she said. ""For those who have already died, we must win."" (Reporting by Andrew R.C.
