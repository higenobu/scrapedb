4/12/2022,"The Church of England’s procedures for addressing issues of racial injustice and contested heritage are “inadequate” and “not fit for purpose”, according to the head of Jesus College at the University of Cambridge. The damning assessment was made as the college ruled out an appeal against a church court judgment preventing the removal of a memorial in its chapel to 17th-century benefactor Tobias Rustat, who was involved with the slave trade. It claimed, however, that the recent ruling by the consistory court of the Diocese of Ely was “fundamentally wrong” and said the current process for deciding these issues urgently needs reform. “Many students and members of the college community put their trust in the church process, and understandably feel let down by the judgment and its misrepresentation of their views,” said Sonita Alleyne, who is master of Jesus College and the first black head of any Oxbridge college. “The consistory court’s decision shows a lack of understanding of the lived experience of people of colour in modern Britain,” she added. Jesus College argued the memorial, in a prominent position on the west wall of the Grade I-listed chapel, should be moved to another site in the college because its presence was having a negative impact on the mission and ministry of the church. Rustat, a former courtier to Charles II and one of the college’s most significant benefactors, was involved with the Royal Adventurers, later the Royal African Company, which trafficked and traded enslaved Africans. But the court ruled that opposition to the memorial was based on “a false narrative” about the scale of the financial rewards Rustat gained from slavery, and ordered that the memorial should remain in the chapel, which is the oldest in Cambridge. “Having taken advice, and after much thought, the college council has decided not to appeal the disappointing judgment,” said Alleyne. “While we believe the judgment is fundamentally wrong, the time and costs involved in appealing the decision are significant, and the grounds on which we are allowed to appeal are restrictive. “We will take our time and consider what to do next. The presence of the memorial in our chapel continues to be a serious issue for our increasingly diverse community. We strongly believe that our stance will place us on the right side of history.” Alleyne reminded the church of its commitment to take action last year in its report From Lament to Action. “This judgment demonstrates the inadequacies of the church process for addressing issues of racial injustice and contested memorialisation. It is not fit for purpose. “There is a much overdue debate happening within the church about how best to face up to the legacy of racial injustice. We will continue to keep up the pressure, because this matters to our students.” The Rev James Crockford, Dean of Chapel at Jesus College, said the Rustat memorial was a test case for the church. “It is clear that, if the Church of England wishes to take diversity and inclusion seriously, it cannot ignore the implications of this decision for the wider mission of the church to be a place where all are welcome.” A spokesperson for the Church of England responded: “The Church of England’s processes allowed for this case to be considered at great length, in a court of law. “The parallel process for secular listed buildings is subject to the government’s policy of ‘retain and explain’ articulated by the secretary of state. “We continue to believe that the church’s ability to adopt a distinctive approach to cases of this type is important, balancing heritage considerations with the unique place churches, cathedrals and chapels have as centres of living mission and ministry.”",News/World news,"C of E procedures on racial injustice ‘inadequate’, says Cambridge college",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/c-of-e-procedures-on-racial-injustice-inadequate-says-cambridge-college
4/12/2022,"Growth in UK retail sales slowed last month as fears over the rising cost of living led to the sharpest drop in consumer confidence since the 2008 financial crisis, according to industry data. The British Retail Consortium said total sales rose by 3.1% in March compared with the same month a year earlier, significantly down on the 6.7% increase in February and 12-month average growth rate of 10.3%. Comparing March with the same month in 2019 before the Covid pandemic spread, total sales rose by 5.4%, as retailers warned rising inflation was beginning to hurt consumer spending. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said it was likely that strength in the total value of retail sales reflected the surge in prices rather than a rush by consumers back to the shops after the easing of pandemic restrictions. “The rising cost of living and the ongoing war in Ukraine has shaken consumer confidence, with expectations of people’s personal finances over the next 12 months reaching depths not seen since the 2008 financial crisis,” she said. “Ultimately, consumers face an enormous challenge this year, and this is likely to be reflected in retail spend in the future.” The latest snapshot compiled by the retail industry showed a rise in spending on beauty and fashion items before Mother’s Day – 27 March – while the fact that people were gradually returning to town and city centres was leading to an uptick in demand for clothes. However, spending on food dropped by 6.1%, possibly due to a later Easter compared with a year earlier, and as consumers returned to eating out in restaurants and pubs after the Omicron variant had weighed on demand. Susan Barratt, chief executive of the research organisation IGD, said the prospect of soaring prices had driven consumer confidence below levels last seen in December 2013 when the horsemeat scandal rocked the food industry. “These challenges affect shoppers in different ways, with household cutbacks seeing less affluent shoppers skipping meals to save money,” she said. “This volatile time is set to continue as the reality of the energy price increase, as well as general inflation, hits home for shoppers.” Separate figures from Barclaycard showed consumer card spending rose by 17.7% in March, largely caused by an increase in fuel and food prices as households come under mounting pressure from living costs. Barclaycard, the UK’s biggest credit card provider, processing nearly half of all card transactions, said shoppers were buying in bulk to save money, with many stocking up on non-perishable items and household supplies. With petrol and diesel prices hitting a record high after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine drove up global energy markets, it said spending on fuel rose by 26.1%. In response to high prices, surveys on behalf of the card provider showed 41% of people were changing the way they travel, including walking and cycling more, and cutting back on longer car journeys. Jose Carvalho, head of consumer products at Barclaycard, said: “Rising fuel prices and household bills are clearly starting to influence consumer behaviour, with many Brits changing their travel and shopping habits to save money. “While this may dampen growth in the months ahead, we shouldn’t overlook the expected heatwave later in April, and the Easter holidays, both of which are likely to boost non-essential spending.”",News/Business,Retail sales slide as UK consumer confidence sinks to record low,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/12/retail-sales-slide-as-uk-consumer-confidence-sinks-to-record-low
4/12/2022,"The outgoing Doctor Who showrunner has revealed that pressures of working during the Covid pandemic threatened to curtail his three-series run to two. Chris Chibnall, who is bowing out as the show’s executive producer after taking over from Steven Moffat for series 11, said: “That we made Doctor Who at all during the past two years is a miracle.” Chibnall, 52, told Radio Times that the pandemic nearly put paid to his and Jodie Whittaker’s plans to leave after three series. “There was a point around April/May 2020 where it looked like we would have to call it a day after two series. If we had not already planned to leave after series three, there’s no way I would be staying on now after going through that experience,” he said. A planned final trio of specials – culminating in the Doctor’s regeneration this autumn – faced production and budget pressures, forcing him to pare down Eve of the Daleks, which aired on new year’s day. He had to ditch the original idea and write a new script in a week, he said. Chibnall wrote five episodes for Doctor Who under Russell T Davies and Moffat before becoming showrunner. He was also lead writer on the spin-off Torchwood for its first two series from 2006 and created and wrote ITV’s popular Broadchurch. Having worked with Whittaker on Broadchurch before casting her as the Doctor, he described her as one of the greatest actors of her generation. He promised her three-series run would wrap up in “a really huge, fun, action-y, mad, heartbreaking way”, with lots of laughs and tears in her final episode. As he prepares for his final Doctor Who specials to air, Chibnall described working on the show as a “treadmill”. Of his decision to move on, he said he owed it to his family, of whom he hadn’t seen much in recent years. Davies is returning in time for the show’s 60th anniversary next year. Chibnall billed this Easter’s special, Legend of the Sea Devils, as an action-adventure romp, which would see the Doctor and her companion Yasmin, played by Mandip Gill, finally address their romantic feelings for each other. Chibnall said conversations between the pair would be “developing and taking place”. Since first appearing on screen in 1963, the Doctor has often been involved in romantic subplots, but this would be the Time Lord’s first same-sex relationship with a companion. In Eve Of The Daleks Yasmin finally confided her feelings for the Doctor to Dan Lewis, played by the comedian John Bishop. Chibnall said: “Dan has cottoned on to the dynamic between the Doctor and Yaz, and from a distance observed what they haven’t been admitting to themselves. “I think really, in Eve of the Daleks, both Yaz and the Doctor have hinted that they have feelings that they are suppressing and keeping quiet about. So there are some conversations that need to be had and you will see those conversations developing and taking place in Legend Of The Sea Devils.” Gill, who has played the Doctor’s assistant since 2017, also offered an insight. She said: “Conversations are not concluded in this episode, but they still definitely have advanced from where they were at the new year’s episode. There’s a lot of open and honest conversations.” Chibnall said he had “absolutely loved” his time as showrunner. “It’s such a privilege. Few people have done it and you are standing in the footsteps of those people across 60 years.”",Arts/Television & radio,"Pandemic nearly made me quit Doctor Who, says showrunner Chris Chibnall",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/12/pandemic-nearly-made-me-quit-doctor-who-says-showrunner-chris-chibnall
4/12/2022,"Teenage climate crisis campaigner Anjali Sharma has revealed the torrent of sexist and racist abuse she has received while fronting a legal case against the Morrison government’s approval of a New South Wales coal project. Sharma, 17, from Melbourne, was one of eight young people who, with the support of octogenarian nun Sister Brigid Arthur, tried unsuccessfully to block the Whitehaven Coal Vickery mine expansion. Lawyers for the group will announce on Tuesday that they will not appeal last month’s federal court judgment, which overturned a finding that the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, had a duty of care to protect younger people from the climate crisis when considering fossil fuel developments. Sharma, whose family moved to Australia from India when she was 10 months old, has made some of the messages she has received through Twitter and Instagram public. They read: “Typical migrant. Maybe you should get raped. Sort u out” “What right do you have to come here and tell this government what to do” Sharma told Guardian Australia she had not reported the messages to police or to the social media platforms. “You won’t change people like this or make them reconsider what they say,” she said. “If they are willing to say vile stuff like this, then there’s no chance of having a decent conversation, so I see no value in complaints about [the messages].” My court case against Sussan Ley brought me into the public spotlight two years ago. Since then I’ve been constantly hit by absolutely vile racism. Here’s a tiny sample, because enough is enough and now I’m going to talk about it. pic.twitter.com/cocEf41Ezj She posted screenshots of the “absolutely vile racism” on social media, and added that nobody should expect her to be silenced. “Now I’m paying it forward. To my young women of colour,” she wrote. “Don’t let them laugh at your food, your culture, your traditional dress or your beautiful language. “Don’t let them ‘other’ you. If you’re anything like me, your culture means more to you than you can express in words, so hold it close to your heart always.” She said that while Australia is multicultural,“we have so far to go for adequate representation for people of colour in the media and in popular culture. “I have found myself wondering: if I was not a person of colour, would the case have got more media?” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning She had been hesitant to publicly reveal the abuse, she said, in case it opened her up to more – but said she wanted to be a role model for other young people of colour. Women of colour have inspired her to fight, she said, such as Ugandan climate activist Vanessa Nakate, Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi, Melbourne writer Maggie Zhou and Varsha Yajman, a paralegal at the firm that took on the case. In the federal court in July last year, Justice Mordecai Bromberg ruled that the environment minister had a duty “to take reasonable care” to “avoid causing personal injury or death” to Australians under 18 “arising from emissions of carbon dioxide into the Earth’s atmosphere” from the approval of Whitehaven Coal’s project near Boggabri in northern NSW. But the government successfully appealed that ruling. Sharma said it had been tough to come to a collective decision not to appeal, but that the case had succeeded in seeing climate science accepted in the federal court. “We have exposed the true lengths that the government will go to continue business as usual,” she said. “They spent 10 years in power and a lot of that time has been spent approving fossil fuel projects. They’re not willing to make a change. “They will take eight children to court on taxpayer money to allow them to keep [the status quo] . We forced them to say the quiet part out loud.” Lawyer David Barnden of Equity Generation Lawyers, who led the case, said: “To have that evidence before a court and for it to be unchallenged by the minister forms a solid basis for other actions”.",News/Law,Teen climate activist subjected to sexist and racist abuse amid federal court climate case,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/apr/12/teen-climate-activist-subjected-to-sexist-and-racist-abuse-amid-federal-court-climate-case
4/12/2022,"A video recently posted online shows what happens when police try to apprehend an autonomous vehicle – only to find nobody inside. Police in San Francisco stopped a vehicle operated by Cruise, an autonomous car company backed by General Motors, in a video posted on 1 April. Officers approached the car, which had been driving without headlights, only to find it was empty. “Ain’t nobody in it – this is crazy,” a bystander can be heard saying in the video. The car then speeds away to the other side of the intersection, leaving the police behind. The video, which has since circulated widely on social media, prompted inevitable jokes. “Welcome to the future,” quipped one Twitter user. Welcome to the future. Cop pulls over driverless car (because no lights?) Then Cruise goes on the lamb. (via https://t.co/mtmsIeOAUP) pic.twitter.com/ecQ5xXuSnS Cruise is working to deploy its autonomous driving technology for ride-hailing purposes, transporting riders around the city without a driver. It has been testing its vehicles with a backup driver in the front seat since 2015, but it started allowing users to hail driverless cars in San Francisco in November 2021. The company said in a tweet that the vehicle had behaved as expected by moving to a safer location on the other side of the intersection where police were able to address their concerns. “Our AV yielded to the police vehicle, then pulled over to the nearest safe location, as intended. An officer contacted Cruise personnel and no citation was issued,” Cruise said on its corporate Twitter account. A Cruise spokeswoman, Tiffany Testo, told the Guardian that the vehicle “did not have its headlights on because of a human error, which was the reason the SFPD approached it, and we have fixed the issue that led to this”. She added that the company offered a phone number for police to call with questions any time a vehicle is pulled over. The SFPD did not immediately respond to request for comment about the incident or about its policies for driverless vehicles. The viral video underscores the bumps in the road as companies race to put fully autonomous vehicles on streets. The Cruise video comes just weeks after Waymo, another autonomous car company, announced it would deploy driverless vehicles in San Francisco. Waymo has been working on autonomous driving technology for more than a decade and running fully driverless rides in Arizona for more than a year. But driverless car glitches have made headlines in the past, including a Waymo vehicle that became stuck at an intersection and required rescue. Waymo said in March it would allow passengers in its driverless cars on a trial basis. To partake, interested riders must apply for a waitlist and sign non-disclosure agreements to get early access. Nuro, another autonomous car company, also has a permit for driverless vehicles in San Francisco, but is using it for self-driving delivery services rather than passenger rides. It is already making driverless deliveries in Mountain View, California. Other driverless car firms are working on their own technology, including Elon Musk’s electronic car company Tesla and Aurora Innovation, a company based in Pittsburgh.",News/Technology,"San Francisco police stop self-driving car – and find nobody inside, video shows",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/11/self-driving-car-police-pull-over-san-francisco
4/12/2022,"Police teams that specialise in investigating rape must be set up across England and Wales and independent legal advice must be offered to victims and survivors facing demands for their digital devices, a parliamentary committee has concluded. In an examination of why rape prosecutions are falling, the home affairs select committee found that the unacceptably low numbers of prosecutions for rape and sexual offences would continue without major reforms to the criminal justice system. Reforms should include setting up police rape teams in each force, which have been shown to speed up inquiries and improve communication with victims, according to a report released on Tuesday. The government should also make the provision of independent legal advice a higher priority, particularly for victims facing “unnecessary, excessive requests” for information on their mobile phones, the MPs said. This latest report comes weeks after a joint inspection by two government watchdogs identified multiple failings in the process from the reporting of a rape through to the potential trial and conviction of an assailant. In the year to September 2021, there were 63,136 rape offences recorded – an all-time high – yet only 1.3% of recorded rape offences assigned an outcome resulted in a charge or summons. The number of completed rape prosecutions dropped from 5,190 in 2016-17 to 1,557 in 2020-21, the report said. Diana Johnson MP, the chair of the committee, said the collapse in the number of prosecutions for rape and sexual offences over the past five years was “truly shocking and completely unacceptable”. “From now on, the focus must be on supporting the victims. Reporting an incident should be the beginning of getting justice but instead has become a source of further pain. The fact that even now nearly two-thirds of cases collapse because a victim may not be able to bear going forward is unimaginable. “Specialist support needs to guide victims throughout the process and improved counselling to deal with the long-term effects. We strongly urge the government to further pilot the provision of independent legal advice to victims and survivors grappling with requests from the police to access data from their phones or third-party material,” she said. The report called for the government to work with policing bodies to ensure specialist police rape teams could be put in place across all police forces. “Despite the difference these teams make – including more timely investigations and improved communication both with victims and the CPS – a recent freedom of information request submitted by the Guardian found that at least two-fifths of police forces in England and Wales do not have them set up,” the report said. Victims and survivors faced demands for their data, which could lead to some cases collapsing, the report said, and they should be offered independent legal advice. “A number of organisations highlighted their concerns that the police and the CPS can make what appear to be unnecessary, excessive requests for such data, almost as a matter of course. This can cause delays and the intrusion of privacy that even result in complainants dropping their cases,” the report said. MPs said that reforms must focus on the experience of victims attempting to get justice. Lengthy delays in cases reaching court, harmful evidence-gathering processes and poor provision of support services were turning people away from seeking justice, they said. Programmes intended to improve performance in each of these areas are still at the pilot stage and will require improved funding to be expanded nationally. Counselling needed to be accessible to all victims and survivors, the report concluded. While increased funding for Independent Sexual Violence Advisers was welcomed, the report said there was not enough support in place for counselling and therapy in the long term. Jayne Butler, the chief executive of Rape Crisis, said the report emphasised that the criminal justice system was categorically failing rape victims and survivors, and that steps from the government to rectify the situation lacked ambition and funds. “We are encouraged by the recognition from the committee of the importance of specialist sexual violence and abuse support services as we know that criminal justice is only part of the survivor journey,” she said. “Long-term and specialist support is crucial in ensuring victim and survivor welfare, and this specialist support provision must be available whether a victim or survivor chooses to report or not.” A government spokesperson said: “We’re recruiting more sexual violence advisers, rolling out pre-recorded evidence faster, improving collaboration between the police and Crown Prosecution Service and boosting funding for victim support services to a minimum £440m over the next three years.“The most recent data shows that there has been a modest increase in the number of charges for rape and our reforms will drive this progress further.”",News/UK news,"Put ‘rape teams’ on all police forces in England and Wales, say MPs",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/11/put-teams-on-all-police-forces-in-england-and-wales-say-mps
