2/3/2022,"A serving SAS soldier has told a federal court hearing that fellow personnel were openly hostile to Ben Roberts-Smith and believed the gallantry that earned him the Victoria Cross may have been “falsified”. A former comrade of Roberts-Smith, a still-serving SAS soldier anonymised in court as Person 41, has given two days of evidence about serving alongside the VC winner in Afghanistan.  He said he witnessed Roberts-Smith order a subordinate soldier to execute an unarmed elderly Afghan man allegedly found hiding in a tunnel during a raid, and also saw Roberts-Smith “frog-march” another unarmed Afghan man, who had a prosthetic leg, outside the same compound before throwing him to the ground and shooting him dead with a machine gun. Person 41 said he believed Roberts-Smith was a competent and brave soldier who could be relied upon to have his comrades’ backs. But he told the court on Thursday there were “haters” within the SAS regiment who thought Roberts-Smith was “arrogant”, “thought he was better than everyone else” and was undeserving of his numerous decorations. Roberts-Smith is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts Smith denies any wrongdoing. Person 41 said two other soldiers, known by the court as Person 7 and Person 42, did not believe Roberts-Smith deserved his Victoria Cross, the Australian military’s highest honour. Roberts-Smith was awarded the VC for storming two enemy machine gun posts during a raid at Tizak, in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province in 2010. Person 41 told the court that Person 7’s dislike of Roberts-Smith stemmed from a disbelief over the action. “It always centred around the fact that Person 7 believed ‘RS’ [Roberts-Smith] wasn’t deserving of the Victoria Cross and the events leading up to that were falsified,” he told the court. Person 41 told the court another soldier, Person 42, believed the events that led to Roberts-Smith’s VC “may have been falsified”. “I believe it was along the lines of his arrogance and he thought he was better than everyone else.” Roberts-Smith has previously told the court the Victoria Cross “put a target on my back”. He said he was “white-anted” by other soldiers jealous of his success as a soldier. On Tuesday, Person 41 detailed before the court the deaths of two men during a raid on a compound known as Whiskey 108 in the village of Kakarak, a known insurgent stronghold, in Uruzgan province, on 12 April 2009. This occurred the year before Roberts-Smith’s VC action. Person 41 said, as the compound was being “cleared” by a number of SAS platoons, Roberts-Smith and another soldier, Person 4, borrowed a suppressor from him. He then saw the two soldiers walk over to a captive, unarmed elderly Afghan man, kneeling next to the entrance to a concealed tunnel, where the man had been found hiding. He said Roberts-Smith walked the man about 2 metres until he was in front of Person 4, “then kicked him in the back of the legs behind the knees until he was kneeling down … RS pointed to the Afghan and said to Person 4 ‘shoot him’”. Later in the same raid, Person 41 said he was outside the walled compound when he saw Roberts-Smith “frog-marching” another Afghan man away from the compound entrance. “He [Roberts-Smith] had his machine gun in his right arm, holding it up, and sort of frog-marching the Afghan by the scruff of the neck with his left arm. “I turned to face ‘RS’ to see what was happening. He then proceeded to throw the Afghan male down on to the ground. The Afghan male landed on his back. ‘RS’ then reached down and grabbed him by the shoulder and flipped him on to his stomach. Then I observed him lower his machine gun and shoot approximately three to five rounds into the back of the Afghan male.” “After he’d done that, he looked up and saw me standing there, and looked at me and said ‘are we all cool, we good?’ And I just replied, ‘yeah mate, no worries’.” Person 41 learned later that this man was disabled, and had a prosthetic leg. Under cross-examination on Wednesday, Person 41 defended his evidence. Arthur Moses SC, acting for Roberts-Smith, put to Person 41 his testimony was not true. “You’re lying aren’t you?” “No.” Moses suggested the reason the alleged murders weren’t reported was because they “didn’t happen”. “That’s incorrect. I know what I saw,” Person 41 said. Person 41 said it was more than a decade after the event, in 2020, before he told anybody what he had witnessed at Whiskey 108, because he feared being ostracised and for his career in the regiment. He said disclosing the events could have led to him being returned to Australia with “everybody knowing you’d dobbed in, so to speak”. Person 41 admitted to drinking from the prosthetic leg souvenired from Whiskey 108 by another soldier, and which was used as a drinking vessel at the Australian soldiers’ unofficial bar on base, the Fat Ladies Arms.",News/Australia news,"SAS soldiers considered Ben Roberts-Smith ‘arrogant’ and undeserving of Victoria Cross, court told",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/03/sas-soldiers-considered-ben-roberts-smith-arrogant-and-undeserving-of-victoria-cross-court-told
2/3/2022,"The Turkish president and wild card of Nato diplomacy, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, will fly to Kyiv on Thursday to offer himself again in the role of mediator between Ukraine and the Russian president Vladimir Putin. He will be joining the flock of overseas leaders lending their support to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy and is expected to sign a free-trade deal. With Turkey’s Nato membership often under challenge, partly due to its decision to buy the Russian-made S-400 air-defence system, Erdoğan faces a difficult balancing act in showing continued strong diplomatic support for Ukraine while not damaging his complex long-term relations with Moscow.  In a sign of the visit’s importance, Jake Sullivan, US national security adviser, and Ibrahim Kalin, chief adviser to the president of Turkey, spoke on Tuesday about their commitment to “deter further Russian aggression against Ukraine”, according to a White House statement. The Erdoğan mediation proposal has not yet been picked up by Russia. The US is trying to minimise the number of interlocutors with Putin and the Russian leader seems to believe the best way to solve the Ukraine conflict is through direct bilateral talks with the White House, rather than via any third party. Putin criticised Turkey last year when it sold its Bayraktar TB2 drones to the Ukrainian army. The highly effective weapons could be used against Russian soldiers supporting the rebel-held area of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. The sale led to an official complaint from the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, that Turkey was feeding militarist tendencies. The drones have been credited with tipping the balance towards Azerbaijan in its war over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh enclave with Armenia in late 2020. In practice, Ukraine has used its drones rarely and the precise number sold to the country is unclear. In a recent interview with Al-Monitor, Lt Col Yuri Ignati, spokesperson for the Ukrainian air force, lavished praise on the drones and said his country could not get enough of them. One of Erdoğan’s sons-in-law has a stake in the private sector firm that produces the drones. Iliya Kuva from the Ukrainian Institute of the Future said: “The drones have a pretty huge psychological and political impact on Ukrainian public opinion since Turkey is seen as the country that provides weapons that are modern and good enough to maintain a military balance with Russian forces in the east.” The offer of drones was part of a wider broadening of ties between the two countries including a long-negotiated free-trade deal. On the other hand, Ukrainian politicians have been angered by TurkStream, a gas pipeline inaugurated in 2020. The pipeline takes gas from Russia to Turkey via the Black Sea in a manner that weakens Ukraine’s role as a transit country for Russian gas, in the same way that Nord Stream 2 will if Germany declares it has passed regulatory hurdles. In a bid to reassure Moscow before Erdoğan’s visit, the Turkish defence minister, Hulusi Akar, stressed Ankara’s commitment to the 1936 Montreux Convention, the treaty that strictly restricts Nato forces’ access to the Black Sea through the Bosphorus. The convention regulates maritime traffic through Turkey’s Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits – the link between the Mediterranean and Black seas.Its status is not academic in the event of a conflict. During the confrontation in Georgia, Turkey refused to let US warships into the Black Sea as part of US moves to deter Russia. However, Nato will be monitoring the visit to ensure that Erdoğan does not break ranks over the alliance’s absolute rejection of Putin’s demands for Nato to pull back its borders. Turkey’s turbulent relations with Moscow in Libya and Syria show two countries often in direct conflict but not eager to see relations break down, let alone spill into direct military action. Turkey has been supportive of the Tatar community in Russian-occupied Crimea, but did not join sanctions against Russia in the wake of the 2014 invasion. Turkic Muslim Tatars were a majority until Stalin forced them out and millions resettled in Turkey. Russia has usurped Crimea and “things cannot go on with a mentality of occupation”, Erdoğan said on 17 January.",News/World news,Erdoğan offers to mediate between Ukraine and Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/turkish-president-erdogan-mediate-ukraine-russia
