2/11/2022,"The UK government has given its strongest indication yet it will agree to calls to extend its visa lifeboat scheme to cover Hongkongers aged between 18 and 24 who were at the heart of the recent civilian protests. The current scheme, opened a year ago, is available only to British national (overseas) (BNO) passport holders born before 1997, the date of the handover of the city to China and the ending of the BNO scheme.  A campaign that has the support of prestigious Conservatives including the former foreign secretary William Hague and the last governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, has been under way for months. It calls for a route to citizenship in the UK to be opened to younger Hongkongers if they are the children of BNO passport holders that do not wish to come to the UK. The Home Office minister Andrew Sharpe in a debate on Thursday on the nationality and borders bill for the first time said the government was looking at this age group and will come forward with proposals. The minister said: “We have heard concerns raised, and are very sympathetic to the circumstances of children born on or after July 1997 with BNO parents.” He added he hoped to have an update for this cohort ready by the bill’s report stage. Ministers had previously proposed this age group could apply to reach the UK through a youth mobility scheme and have said they are expecting upto 300,000 Hongkongers to come to the UK over the next five years. Sharpe said 88,000 BNO holders and their family members had applied to the UK by the end of September and 76,000 applications were granted. The net value of the migrants to the UK treasury is estimated to be worth £2.4-2.9bn over five years. Making the call for a relaxation of the rules, David Alton said: “These are courageous young people that need a lifeboat out of the city. These are the very people that flooded the streets and stood up for freedom in 2019.” Research published last year showed 93% of the defendants in street protest cases were between the ages of 18 and 25. Speaking to fellow Lords, Patten praised the BNO lifeboat scheme saying it had already brought many talented young professionals to the UK, including health specialists and teachers. He said the proposal would be a wonderful way “to mend a hole in the lifeboat”, pointing out there has been a comprehensive assault on fundamental freedoms in Hong Kong. He accused China of “the destruction of one of the great free cities in the world”. A previous version of the proposal in parliament tabled by Damian Green was supported by 30 Tory MPs, but rejected by the government. Ministers instead proposed an alternative youth mobility scheme, but this does not provide the same route to citizenship. An estimated 200 young people from Hong Kong have applied for asylum, but some face protest-related criminal charges, making it harder for them to apply for asylum. Some have been waiting for a year.",News/World news,UK may extend visa scheme to young Hongkongers seeking refuge,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/11/uk-may-extend-visa-scheme-to-young-hongkongers-seeking-refuge
2/11/2022,"France against Ireland promises to be a blockbuster and without wishing to be overly anglocentric about a match between the two leading sides in Europe, there is an irresistible narrative as Shaun Edwards and Andy Farrell lock horns again. They are two legends of rugby – winning dozens of major titles during their careers – and I have had the privilege of playing under both. Shaun was the only coach who created a personal relationship between me and defence. If I missed a tackle he almost had a look about him that said: “Why would you do that to me?” Sometimes it is just a case of a bigger man running over a slightly smaller man, but I feared the feedback and the repercussions of not doing my job. Shaun was able to instil that feeling in me. To this day I cannot comprehend how the Rugby Football Union has not written him a blank cheque. His mantra is defence wins you championships and throughout his coaching career he has proven it to be the case.  Similarly, Andy is an unbelievably good motivator. He would have me ready to play Saturday’s game on a Tuesday just by knowing what buttons to press in the team meeting room before going out to train. He got off to a slightly rocky start as Ireland’s head coach, which in many ways was inevitable. He was still learning on the job and it was always going to take time for Ireland to transition after having someone like Joe Schmidt at the helm but to me Ireland look like the most settled team in the tournament. I’m a huge fan of Andy’s. He’s someone who understands his people extremely well which is such an important quality as a head coach who oversees so many players and staff. I get fed up when I hear that good people can’t make good coaches so I’m delighted to see Andy proving them wrong. Both Shaun and Andy know how to manipulate the emotions of their players and get them ready. That’s all you can do as a coach. Good coaches get you believing and doing things that might not be second nature to you. Take France as an example. Their DNA is the manner in which they attack, which is great when they have their tails up, but can they be as desperate in defence as they are electric in attack? That is where Shaun comes in because Ireland have that under Andy. I believe that this Ireland team, in terms of cohesion and clarity of gameplan, is ahead of France at the moment. The potential in the French team is astronomical but I’m not sure they are at the same level of togetherness yet. In a condensed tournament like the Six Nations where you have five matches back-to-back, or at a World Cup where it is seven, I would always look to teams who can bank on their set-piece and their defence. There are so many moving parts in attack and there are times when it just does not function. I look at Ireland and see a team built on defence and set-piece. France, on the other hand, are trying to twin defence and attack but with a greater emphasis on the latter which is why I’m leaning towards Ireland on Saturday. If anyone can prove me wrong though, it is Shaun Edwards. Had you asked me on Monday I’d have been even more confident backing Ireland but then came the news that Johnny Sexton would be absent. When we talk about Sexton we often focus on things like leadership, experience and temperament but we can often forget just how talented he is. The best way to illustrate how important Sexton is to Ireland is that famous drop-goal in Paris four years ago. It all started with his pin-point 22 drop-out. Of course going through 41 phases, when one mistake means it’s all over, requires remarkable effort and execution from everyone in the team but Sexton was the conductor and the composure and accuracy he showed to win the match sums him up. In his own right Joey Carbery is a fine player. He’s been badly hampered by injuries but this weekend gets his shot. He is helped by the fact that Ireland have a very robust and considered gameplan and he will be slotting into a side that feels familiar. The challenge is that he is not coming on the pitch with Ireland already having established dominance as was the case against Wales. He has to hit the ground running from the word go. Ultimately small margins are going to decide this match. We often talk about ‘No Talent Required’ – things like how quickly you get up off the floor, how hard you work in the back of the field or making good decisions at the ruck. I have more confidence in Ireland doing that for 80 minutes than I do France but Gabin Villière’s second try against Italy was a great example. Can they show that sort of effort on both sides of the ball for 80 minutes? If they can then they could find themselves in the box-seat for the championship and as much as they are a delight to watch, they desperately need a Six Nations title either this year or next, before they host the World Cup. They can take a major step closer to that on Saturday.",Sport/Sport,Edwards v Farrell a fascinating subplot to France v Ireland | Ugo Monye,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/11/edwards-v-farrell-a-fascinating-subplot-to-frances-tantalising-clash-with-ireland
2/11/2022,"Each February the rich and famous descend upon St Moritz, not just for the slopes and après-ski but for one of the world’s most exclusive horse races, held on ice. Though the luxury resort has a nearby airport mainly catering to private jets, and visitors can be seen being ferried around in helicopters and Ferraris, moneyed guests are beginning to think about the climate emergency.  This is because the White Turf race, the only such event in the world held on a frozen lake, is under threat. It is held on the vast expanse of water directly under the Swiss resort, and because of global heating, the lake is melting. St Moritz was created as a ski resort by Britons, and since then it has been a popular place for extreme snow sports, from the breakneck-speed Cresta Run toboggan race to skijoring, which is standing on skis and being dragged along by a horse on the frozen lake. The White Turf has been held for 114 years, with spectators, musicians, caterers, horses and their trainers all gathering to stand on the ice. Until now, no one thought anything of riding horses, ice skating and dancing over a frozen lake – the ice was always known to be steady and thick. Last weekend, 7,000 people from around the world once again descended upon the lake to watch the race. But organisers watched in horror as water “pushed up” under the ice, putting the races in jeopardy. Organisers of the race say they have had to limit the weight of attractions on the ice as the climate heats and the lake melts. This includes giving instructions to luxury kitchens serving oysters, lobster and venison not to bring too much equipment. Last year those running White Turf were horrified as the ice under the VIP tent cracked, meaning it had to be dismantled and rebuilt on thicker ice. This year the race had to be shortened because ice on parts of the lake was melting. A spokesperson for White Turf said: “With enough ice and not too much snow on Lake St Moritz, everything seemed perfectly prepared for this year’s 114th edition of the White Turf. However, over the past week, water pushed through from below in the finishing area, so that the races could not be held as planned. All racing events – flat and trotting races as well as skijoring – were shortened to 800 metres. Since the starting boxes were not in use either, all races were started with the flag.” Because of this, only four horses took part in the main race of the day, competing for a prize of 20,000 Swiss francs (£15,900). All the Swiss trainers snubbed the race because of the shortened distance. The race was further marred by the death of a horse, Echo Beach, which fell after the start and was believed to have suffered an aortic tear after intense exercise. While for now the races go ahead on the ever-creaking ice, visitors joke that one day the White Turf will become a swimming race. As the winters grow warmer, the future of the race is in doubt.",News/Environment,Future of world’s most exclusive horse race on thin ice due to global heating,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/11/future-of-white-turf-st-mortiz-horse-race-on-thin-ice-global-heating
2/11/2022,"As governments across the world loosen pandemic restrictions, Beyoncé’s new powerbob is being hailed as the definitive “back to the office” look. Unveiled by the singer as part of a new collection in her Ivy Park fashion line, the haircut comes as Jennifer Lopez, Selena Gomez, Kesha, Kourtney Kardashian, Alexa Chung have all adopted a sharp and short look.  “Historically, when you think about the bob’s first real moment as a fashion trend, it’s in the 1920s during changing, unstable times,” said the hair historian Rachael Gibson. “It reappears again in the 1960s and 80s as a powerful, no-nonsense, very strong cut – the perfect antidote to any uncertainty. People often cut their hair during times of economic downturn.” At the beginning of the pandemic, a wave of buzzcuts signalled a change in economic fortunes, but also the shift towards work-from-home culture and an abandonment of fussy corporate style. Now, Beyoncé’s powerbob has been declared by members of the Beyhive – an ultra-dedicated group of superfans – as giving a “CEO of the company” look. Beyoncé’s new look also includes the exaggerated shoulder pads of a 1980s power suit. “It definitely reflects the idea of a return to work,” said Gibson. “This is a total boardroom boss look and the bob feels integral to that.” Gibson draws a comparison to Shiv Roy, the “alpha female” of the HBO drama Succession, who debuts a fresh bob cut in season two. “Shiv’s hair oozes quality and money: it’s really expensive-looking hair, both in terms of the cut and its super-luxe condition,” said Gibson. “The cut also suggests that she’s a strong, business woman – or is at least trying to come across as one.” Beyoncé’s powerbob is also a nod to some of the black female icons who have inspired her work, said the fashion historian Darnell-Jamal Lisby. “Diana Ross and Tina Turner… were known for their bob wigs,” Lisby said. “Therefore the hairstyle has this history of sensuality as a form of strength in femininity that is at the core of Beyoncé’s artistry. “Having a power suit in the collection subtly celebrates the expanding presence of Black people in professional fields and their continued elevation in corporate America,” Lisby added. Wonky-bob hairstyles may be predicted to be this year’s “it” haircut (see: the shaggy “boyfriend” cut, the Mob-mullet/bob hybrid), but Amy Abramite, creative director of Maxine Salon, said that her most requested cut was a conservative “shorter bob without an angle or layers”. Abramite added the ideal length of cut “hugs the chin” and is worn “with the ends turned slightly under”. So new you, new bob? Gibson sees the powerbob as the ultimate fresh start. “It’s literally cutting away the dead weight and presenting a new version of yourself to the world,” she said. “It’s the hair equivalent of switching your working-from-home joggers for a really well-fitted piece [of clothing].”",Lifestyle/Fashion,Short and sharp: Beyoncé launches ‘back to the office’ powerbob,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/feb/11/short-and-sharp-beyonce-launches-back-to-the-office-powerbob-haircut
2/11/2022,"The UK’s equalities watchdog is facing calls for it to lose its status as an internationally recognised human rights body amid claims of politicisation and taking a “determinedly anti-trans stance”. A coalition of 19 LGBT+ organisations led by Stonewall and supported by the Good Law Project says the Equality and Human Rights Commission has taken a “recent and significant” shift on trans rights that has prompted them to make a submission to the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions calling for the body to lose its “A-rating”.  The chief executive of the commission, Marcial Boo, said Stonewall and others were “aiming at the wrong target” and urged them to “work with us to identify discrimination against LGBT people so we can take action together to stop it”. The call follows two interventions by the commission at the end of January, in which it recommended that the UK government’s proposed ban on conversion practices not extend to trans people, and it wrote to the Scottish government asking it to pause plans to simplify the legal requirements for gender recognition, reversing its previous position. At the time this was met with fury by some Scottish campaigners who railed against “UK government appointees telling us in Scotland how to legislate in devolved areas”. The commission insisted impartiality was “a core value” and that all decisions “are made independently of any government”. The 19-page submission outlines what the Stonewall-led coalition claims is evidence of “the numerous ways the EHRC now finds itself falling short of international standards”. This includes a “complete absence” of financial autonomy from the UK government and “excessive” governmental interference, including “politically motivated” appointments to the chair and board, “many of whom have repeatedly and publicly demonstrated their opposition to the expansion of human rights, and whose appointments have drawn widespread criticism from NGOs”. A spokesperson from the commission said it took all decisions “impartially, based on evidence and the law, both in the UK and internationally”, that its independence was “guaranteed in statute”, and that all appointments were made through “a fair, open and transparent recruitment process”. “Our statutory mandate and role as a national human rights institution is to protect and promote equality and human rights for everyone – and that includes trans people. Where rights may conflict, our role is to advise on striking an appropriate balance. We uphold fairness for all, and our work is rigorous and impartial.” Calling on the UK government to “revive” an independent EHRC, Nancy Kelley, the CEO of Stonewall, said: “The politicisation of the UK’s human rights body has placed trans people in the firing line, but this attempt to create a hierarchy of human rights in the UK is a very real threat to everyone, particularly those of us protected by the Equality Act”. The submission comes amid growing concerns about the role and independence of the EHRC.

2/11/2022,"It is almost Valentine’s Day, but that is not why I’m thinking about jewellery. Well, it sort of is, but it also really isn’t. Unfashionably, I love Valentine’s Day, but the spirit of Saint Valentine is very much one of card and flowers, to me. When did it get turned into expensive, sexy Christmas? Jewellery and Valentine’s Day go together like – I was going to say Romeo and Juliet, but only the dreamy first date bit. Both jewellery and Valentine’s Day are about love, but jewellery has always been, as Valentine’s Day is now, also about money. In the bronze age, rings were traded as an early form of currency; the ancient Egyptians had wedding rings, a habit adopted by their Greek conquerers. Roman wedding rings were forged from iron, sometimes with a key motif to symbolise a wife’s control over household finances. For women who could neither work nor own property, jewellery given by a husband or a parent was both a love token – and a potential running away fund, to be squirrelled away just in case the love part didn’t work out. So, while it is fashionable to blame modern hypercapitalism for everything, jewellery was about money as well as love long before De Beers invented the diamond engagement ring with its 1947 slogan, “A diamond is forever”.  Jewellery, like underwear, is more deeply connected to the personal than the rest of our wardrobes. Shifts in how we live and how we think matter more than changes on the catwalk. The hopes and dreams for the future that have always been symbolised by a diamond are measured, increasingly, in ethical credentials rather than carats. Lab-grown diamonds have made sparkle accessibly priced, and sustainability credentials have boosted their status. The brand Pandora claims that one of the smaller diamonds from its human-made Pandora Brilliance collection has a carbon footprint equivalent to that of a litre of milk, although the traditional diamond industry argues that ethical production of natural diamonds is more socially responsible than abandoning communities in Africa who rely on mining for their livelihoods. That most jewellery is now bought by women for themselves (in 2018, 78% of purchases were made by women, according to Lyst) has changed everything. A world that was once gold, silver and white (with rose gold for the daring, woo-hoo!) has exploded into colour. Laura Lambert, the young founder and CEO of ethical fine jewellery brand Fenton, told me recently that the popularity of coloured gemstones reflected for her customers a feeling that modern love comes in many forms. The diamond engagement ring is rooted in an era when a woman was allowed to dream of having a husband, but not of having a wife. (Me, I go weak at the knees for an emerald every time.) And if rainbow shades aren’t your thing, look out for a collection created by ethical fashion designer Amy Powney with British jewellery legend Monica Vinader, out next week, which mixes sustainable natural “galaxy” diamonds, which are grey, with seed-shaped keshi pearls. Jewellery is about status and values, but it is also about the little things. Literally, at the moment. Have you tried wearing a mask with large earrings? Take off your mask and the ear loop catches in your earring and pulls it out, sending the butterfly fastening flying so that, even if you can pick up the earring, you can’t put it back in. Or the earring stays in, but the ear loop gets twisted into it, so that you are left clumsily trying to extricate mask from hoop. I have admitted defeat, and retreated into huggie hoops: doll-sized sparkly hoops which are small enough not to get in the way. And small jewellery, for daytime at least, also feels more practical now that the world is opening up and outfit planning is increasingly complicated, with pilates classes jigsawed between meetings and stuff to do after work. The old me would have worn big earrings and taken them off for pilates, but if the new me did that she would almost certainly leave said earrings in the changing room. Jewellery that adds sparkle but is small enough not to get in the way feels right for now. That’s what I’ll be wearing on Valentine’s Day.",Lifestyle/Fashion,My current favourite earrings?

2/11/2022,"What easy but impressive date-night dishes would you recommend for Valentine’s Day?Ben, Cardiff As Lara Lee, author of Coconut & Sambal, sensibly points out: “Valentine’s Day is on a Monday this year, so it’s all about having as little washing-up as possible.” The solution? Turn up the heat with a Thai green or red curry. “I’ve been exploring the world of good curry pastes, which you can buy in Asian supermarkets,” says Lee, who favours the Mae Ploy, Maesri, Pantai, Nittaya and Lobo brands. “Fry it in a bit of oil, add a couple of cans of coconut milk, your chosen protein and vegetables, and – voila! – you have a curry.” Lee does, however, “pimp the paste”, throwing in a couple of makrut lime leaves (“I always keep a tub of them in the freezer”), bruised lemongrass and minced ginger. “It can then simmer while you’re sipping wine and listening to Kenny G.”  Shareable food such as meze is a good way to go, says Ravinder Bhogal, chef/owner of Jikoni in London. “I also love seafood, especially scallops. They take mere moments to cook, or try them cured in a ceviche.” Emily Scott, chef-owner of Emily Scott Food at Watergate Bay in Cornwall, is also #teamscallops, which she fries before topping with a classic beurre blanc. “Make them more of a main course by serving with new potatoes and greens, or, if it’s for a starter, some nice bread.” A big pot of “comforting but delicate” fish stew is sure to make your night in (or any night, for that matter) special, Scott adds. While that might sound a bit of a faff for a Monday, you could always make the base (finely sliced onion and fennel, garlic, tinned tomatoes, a good pinch of saffron and fish or veg stock) the day before. “Then all you’re doing on the day is cooking whatever fish you want – mussels, clams, prawns, gurnard – in that sauce.” Oh, and knocking up a saffron aïoli (“or cheat and buy mayonnaise”) to spread on accompanying crostini. Mussels and clams are also perfect partners for linguine, Bhogal says: “You may have your Lady and the Tramp moment yet.” More spaghetti slurping can be found in puttanesca, which, Scott notes, earns bonus points for being red. Heat some olive oil in a saucepan, then “add tinned cherry tomatoes with a couple of finely chopped garlic cloves, capers, oregano, some chilli flakes or half a finely diced red chilli, black olives and anchovies.” Bubble away, toss in the cooked pasta and serve with finely chopped parsley. Valentine’s Day is, of course, a friend of the sweet-toothed. “I love making jelly,” says Bhogal, who suggests a rhubarb and custard number. “Gorgeously pink, like a just spanked bottom, with a shot of booze in it to keep it jolly but adult.” Happily, that can be made ahead of time, too. The same goes for old-school chocolate mousse or pannacotta, which Scott serves with figs that have been halved, sprinkled with sugar, and caramelised under the grill. “And things dipped in chocolate are always good, aren’t they?” And as easy to make for two people as they are for one, because, Scott says, “lovingly cooking something for yourself is also really important”.

2/11/2022,"A homeless woman who was sexually assaulted by a stranger as she slept in a tent has been awarded damages by police after she accused them of failing to investigate properly. The woman was sleeping rough in Manchester city centre in August 2020 when she awoke to find a man in her tent with his hand inside her clothes while he carried out a sexual act on himself.  Despite reporting the incident to Greater Manchester police (GMP), the case was closed shortly afterwards without officers having taken a formal statement from the woman or a witness, according to the woman’s lawyer. The woman discussed the sexual assault with other homeless women in the days after and four others said they had also experienced a similar assault by a man of the same description, her lawyer said. Nicola Bailey-Gibbs at Hudgell Solicitors, who represented the woman, said: “These sexual assaults on vulnerable homeless women in Manchester city centre were not minor offences and these officers should not have treated them as minor offences. “They were a series of disturbing sexual assaults that should have prompted concern amongst officers whose job it is to protect the public, whoever they may be and whatever circumstances they find themselves in. “This may well have been a serial sex attacker and Greater Manchester police officers appear not to have been open to that possibility. Sexual assaults cannot be ignored, by doing so the consequences could be catastrophic.” The woman was paid £2,800 damages by GMP in an out-of-court settlement. GMP did not accept any liability for the incident, the Guardian understands. The force has been contacted for comment. Bailey-Gibbs said the woman immediately reported the incident to police and officers arrived at the scene. However, she maintains they spoke to her only briefly in the back of a patrol car. CCTV footage was later reviewed by police and then the sexual assault case was closed. No formal statements were taken from the woman or her partner, who was a witness, and no other potential witnesses were interviewed. Hudgell Solicitors believes that had officers carried out a proportionate investigation they would have established a link to all five sexual assaults. “Formal statements should have been taken from all five women and other CCTV should also have been reviewed; had these appropriate actions been taken we believe the outcome could have proved more fruitful,” the firm said in a statement. Bailey-Gibbs said the consequences of the police officers’ actions in failing to investigate could have been catastrophic: “We know that Sarah Everard’s killer was exposing himself in public before going on to commit a murder, these offences simply cannot be taken lightly. “Investigations are under way into how police forces handled allegations that [Everard’s killer] Wayne Couzens indecently exposed himself and whether the appropriate actions were taken, including whether policies and procedures were followed. “My client and other vulnerable women deserve better, and I hope the Greater Manchester police force has reviewed the way it responds to and investigates reports of sexual assaults,” she said.

Derby were placed into administration last September and the sale of the club has been complicated in part by the claims of Middlesbrough and Wycombe.  The club said details of the accord between Morris and Gibson had been shared with the joint administrator Quantuma before the sides’ Championship meeting at the Riverside on Saturday. Derby said a resolution had been reached after “private conversations” between Gibson and Morris, who had invited Middlesbrough and Wycombe to take their claims against him personally, in an attempt to remove a major obstacle in the financially stricken club’s attempt to secure a new owner. A Derby statement said: “The claim has clearly been the source of much concern to both sets of fans, and especially those of Derby County. The fact that a resolution has been discussed and agreed should be comforting to both sets of supporters. “Details of the accord shall remain private. However, it is important for all interested parties, including potential bidders, to be confident that the Middlesbrough claim will not be an impediment to Derby County progressing its plans for a sale of the club.” Carl Jackson, partner on behalf of Quantuma, said: “We are pleased to see that an acceptable resolution has been identified which allows us to push forward with our plans for the sale of the club.” Middlesbrough and Wycombe have been seeking compensation worth millions after Derby breached financial rules.

2/11/2022,"Grandparents planning hefty amounts of childcare this half-term might want to think again after research claimed to disprove previous findings of a “rejuvenating effect” from looking after grandchildren. Many studies have appeared to show mental and physical health advantages for those who care for their grandchildren. But none involved researchers talking to the same grandparents before and after their caregiving responsibilities began.  When the authors of Is There a Rejuvenating Effect of (Grand)Childcare? A Longitudinal Study, published this week in The Journals of Gerontology, did that, they found that caring for grandchildren failed to make grandparents feel any younger than their actual age. The age people feel they are – as opposed to the age on their birth certificate – is seen as a strong indicator of their mental and physical wellbeing, sometimes even outperforming chronological age as a direct predictor of psychological and health-related outcomes, including risk of death. “This is the first study to look at the same people before and after taking up grandparental childcare in terms of the effects on subjective age,” said Dr Valeria Bordone, co-author of the report. Bordone is also co-author of a 2016 report, Do Grandchildren Influence How Old You Feel? That found over-65s who take care of grandchildren feel at least two years younger than their age, rising to 2.6 years for men aged 74-85. But her new findings have given her pause for thought. “Contrary to our 2016 findings, our new study found no youthful effect of the transition from not being a caregiver to becoming a grandchild caregiver for either grandfathers or grandmothers,” she said. The new study was welcomed by Prof Cecilia Tomassini, a leading member of the Grandparenting in Europe network of researchers. “This research adds important insight to a question that hasn’t previously been interrogated by going back to the same people,” she said. “Even studies that have gone back to the same group have tended to lose sight of grandparents in ill health because they’ve dropped out of the research. This means those papers have ended up by only looking at healthy grandparents, which is why they’ve been getting, until now, largely positive responses.” Bordone now believes that attributing a causal effect between childcare provision and feeling younger is wrong. Instead, she said, the link is likely to have more to do with hidden selection effects. “It may well be that personality traits and family values that mean grandparents already have a young, subjective age are overrepresented among individuals who provide care to others,” she said. In short, rather than childcare making grandparents feel young, it’s the grandparents who feel young already who do more childcare. When Bordone researched this issue in 2016, she asked adults who care for their grandchildren how young and healthy they felt. This time, she questioned the same 7,730 adults aged 50–85 before they began childcare. Returning over a period of time during which 21% started providing childcare, she asked the same question. Those who never provided childcare remained in the control group. If your children’s grandparents are now reluctant to step up this half-term, you might have more luck asking a friend or neighbour of grandparent age. The research threw up the unexpected finding that there are slight benefits in older adults looking after young children who are not their own kin. The hypothesis, said Bordone, is that unrelated children bring with them the rejuvenating effect of youth – without the same reminder of old age that grandchildren do. “Grandparenthood is a powerful reminder of a person’s ageing and as such it is likely to affect subjective age,” she said.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Looking after grandchildren has no health advantages, study suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/11/grandparents-looking-after-grandchildren-has-no-health-advantages-study-suggests

Klopp credited Díaz’s “skill-set and character” for the seamless introduction and, despite calling for calm, admits he was captivated by the winger’s 89-minute display.  “It was his first game and it was probably one of the best I ever saw from a new player, that’s true, because he looked completely natural,” the Liverpool manager said. “But it was only a first game and we have to see how he adapts to working with intensity and all this kind of things in the Premier League. “There is no rush. Last night was a very good opportunity to start him because of Sadio not being here yet and Mo [Salah] coming back from an incredibly tense tournament and, yes, he showed up.”",Sport/Football,Klopp hails Luis Díaz’s first Liverpool start as ‘one of the best I ever saw’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/11/jurgen-klopp-luis-diaz-first-liverpool-start-one-of-the-best-i-ever-saw
