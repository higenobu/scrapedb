5/4/2022,"The Australian Border Force has confirmed the transfer of 12 immigration centre detainees to Christmas Island, 24-hours after a heated clash between police and protesters outside a Melbourne detention centre on Tuesday. Guardian Australia understands that 12 detainees, including one person whose refugee status has been approved, were woken by guards at the Melbourne International Transit Accommodation centre early yesterday morning and told they would be moved to Christmas Island. The border force did not respond to questions on Tuesday and released a one-line statement early Wednesday, saying: “The ABF does not comment on the details of specific operational matters.” On Wednesday afternoon, it said the group being transferred had their right to remain in the country revoked under section 501 of the Migration Act, which allows the minister to cancel a visa on character grounds. “The cohort being transferred is made up of detainees whose visas have been cancelled due to being a risk to the community, and includes those convicted of serious crimes relating to assault, illicit drugs, robbery, domestic violence and other offences,” the border force statement said. “Detainees are transferred between facilities to balance the detainee population and security risk.” The Morrison government reopened the Christmas Island detention centre in August 2020. There are about 212 people held in detention on Christmas Island, 90 of whom had their visas revoked by the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton. At least one of those transferred on Tuesday has had their refugee status recognised but was put back in detention after their visa was revoked, the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said. They are challenging that decision through the courts in Victoria. Their lawyer was not notified of their transfer. Another detainee, who immigrated to Australia at three months old and had his visa revoked under section 501, but who remains in the centre, said that more than 20 guards went to the unit before 5am to tell the selected detainees to pack their bags. “We have asked them to let us know the day before – in prison they let you know the day before,” the detainee said. “Just so people can let their family or their lawyers know. But they don’t.” The transfer was temporarily blocked by protesters who surrounded a minibus outside the centre yesterday to prevent it from leaving. The detainees were then placed in another larger bus and taken away. Victorian senator Lidia Thorpe attended the protest and was filmed telling the police confronting protesters that they were “an absolute disgrace”. “How dare you treat people like that?” Thorpe said, in a video shared on her social media accounts. “How dare you manhandle women like you did?” Thorpe said in a statement on Wednesday that she was there in solidarity with activists and detainees, and that activists have the right to protest without being confronted by police.

Police say they expect she will be charged on summons for traffic offences. “Investigators will continue to review CCTV footage of the incident and there may be further charges,” the spokesperson said.",News/Australia news,Immigration detainees transferred from Melbourne to Christmas Island amid heated protests,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/04/immigration-detainees-transferred-from-melbourne-to-christmas-island-amid-heated-protests
5/4/2022,"Elon Musk has said Twitter may charge a “slight” fee for commercial and government users, in the latest hint of the changes the world’s richest person could introduce after he completes his takeover of the social media platform. “Twitter will always be free for casual users, but maybe a slight cost for commercial/government users,” Musk said in a tweet. “Some revenue is better than none!” he added in another tweet. The Tesla chief executive has agreed to buy Twitter for $44bn (£35.2bn), in a deal funded by $21bn of his own money, a further $12.5bn borrowed against his shareholding in Tesla and the rest made up by loans from banks. The estimated $1bn in interest costs attached to the funding have raised speculation that Musk will introduce charges on the platform and cut costs in order to make the transaction financially viable. In a series of tweets referring to his ambitions for the platform in recent weeks, Musk has suggested a number of changes to Twitter, including making the algorithms, which curate what users see on the platform, “open source” – or transparent to developers and users. He has also pledged to defeat spambots, and “authenticate” all humans. Last week it was reported that Musk had told banks he would develop new ways to monetise tweets and crack down on executive pay to slash costs at the social media platform. Musk also told the banks he planned to develop features to grow business revenue, including new ways to make money out of tweets that contain important information or go viral, sources told Reuters. At the annual Met Gala in New York on Monday, Musk said the reach of Twitter was only “niche” and he would want a much bigger percentage of the American population to be on it. Twitter has 229 million daily users worldwide. In tweets that were subsequently deleted, Musk suggested changes to the platform’s premium subscription service, Twitter Blue, including slashing its price, banning advertising and giving an option to pay in the cryptocurrency dogecoin.",News/Technology,Elon Musk considers ‘slight’ Twitter fee for commercial users,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/04/elon-musk-considers-slight-twitter-fee-for-commercial-users
5/4/2022,"“I have a new lower-league team (in the NPSL – one version of the fourth division in the US and considered the highest tier of amateur football) in my area that will open play in two weeks,” begins Harriet Osborn. “They will borrow a local school’s stadium which has a capacity of 8,500. As a few students of that school like to point out, that’s a larger capacity than some stadiums used by professional teams in Europe, such as Salford City (5,108). What is the most extreme example of this: how many leagues of difference can we find between a big stadium in a lower division and a smaller stadium in a higher one?” Perhaps the most obvious answer to this is perennial stadium-stat conquerors Queen’s Park. The 52,000-capacity Hampden Park was home to the Scottish League One side for over a century but as of 2021 they are homeless, their lease on the ground having ended, and are awaiting development of a new home. Nevertheless in 2012-13 Queen’s Park were in the fourth tier of Scottish football while Ross County’s 6,541-capacity Victoria Park was hosting top-tier action. In England, Darlington played at the 25,000-seat Reynolds Arena while in the National League in 2010-11. That same season, the 16,220-capacity Bloomfield Road hosted Blackpool in the Premier League. And the 11,000-capacity Dean Court hosted Premier League football in 2019-20 – that same season Notts County played fifth-tier National League football at their Meadow Lane ground that holds 18,816. Beyond the big boys of the National League, there have been some pretty large borrowed stadiums playing host to games way down the pyramid. Gateshead play at the 11,800-capacity Gateshead International Stadium – a home for athletics in the north east – and in 2003-04 were a Northern Premier Division One side in the seventh tier. There was nothing smaller in the Premier League that year but Rotherham were in the second tier playing at the 8,300-capacity Millmoor. Widnes FC’s home games are at the 13,350 Halton Stadium – home of Widnes Vikings rugby league club – and they played in the 10th-tier North West Counties League Division One in 2013-14. That same season Yeovil were in the Championship – Huish Park holds 9,565. And, the biggest gap we’ve found, non-league Hull United briefly shared Hull Kingston Rovers’ 12,225-capacity Craven Park, and were there for much of the Northern Counties East League Division One 2015-16 season – the 10th tier of English football (or possibly the 11th – it’s not entirely clear). Good old 11,000-capacity Dean Court hosted Premier League Bournemouth that same year. “Fulham have secured their fourth promotion to the Premier League, which is surely a record. But, unlike Sky, we know football didn’t begin in 1992. So which club holds the record for promotions to the top tier of English football? I’ll open the bidding with Fulham’s five, but I’m sure there are plenty of clubs with more than that,” writes Richard Hirst. Hold your horses, Richard. Fulham have a way to go to surpass Norwich’s Premier League promotion prowess – the Canaries have gone up five times in the Premier League era and were relegated for the sixth time at the weekend. Four promotions pre-1992 brings them to a grand total of nine, but that’s still comfortably short of Birmingham City, who have been promoted to the top flight no fewer than 12 times (the first few coming as Small Heath back in the early 1890s). In last week’s Knowledge, we looked at teams playing their home and away fixtures in May, specifically Luton and Nottingham Forest in 1987-88. Turns out that was merely the tip of a rewardingly nerdy iceberg … “There have been many instances in English league football (49 in fact) of two teams playing both fixtures in May,” writes Chris Roe. “The Luton/Forest one identified in last week’s column (13 and 15 May 1988) is not quite the latest. “In 1966, Brighton and Oldham played each other on 13 and 18 May. And in 1977, Newport and Workington played each other on 14 and 17 May. If you flip the question on its head, there are some interesting answers as well. The earliest that two English teams have completed both league fixtures was in 1969, when Middlesbrough and Millwall played on 12 and 18 August. Those games were their second and fourth of the season. “That 1969-70 season was a particularly interesting one for this statistic. In the old Division One, each team played a home-and-away fixture in the second and fourth games, with all the matches taking place between 11 and 20 August.” “In 1899 the UK Baseball champions were Nottingham Forest, while Spurs won it in 1906,” noted Paul Smith in January 2005. “Which other football teams have had baseball connections or are these team names coincidental?” The names are not coincidental. The National Baseball League of Great Britain and Ireland was founded in 1890. Four teams were involved, all with close links to association football clubs: Derby County, Preston North End, Aston Villa and Stoke City. Baseball flourished particularly in the north-east with clubs in Middlesbrough, Darlington, Stockton and Thornaby. In 1933 a National Baseball Association was founded and professional leagues were formed in Lancashire and Yorkshire. The first professional games got under way in 1936, with the Yorkshire League made up of sides from Leeds, Bradford, Sheffield, Hull, Dewsbury, Wakefield and Scarborough. Games regularly attracted 5,000 spectators – and, on occasion, as many as 10,000. “I, like a few others, have a memory of the BBC’s Barry Davies laying into the Italians after their famous defeat to South Korea at the 2002 World Cup. The quote goes something like: ‘... and the Italians go out of the World Cup because they WILL. NOT. LEARN.’ Thing is, I can’t find evidence of it anywhere. I even managed to get hold of the full game (replete with commentary from Davies and Joe Royle) but the famous quote is nowhere to be found. I’m starting to think the whole thing is an apocryphal fever dream. So, am I going mad or did Davies actually say that?” asks Rich Soden. @TheKnowledge_GU Lee Gregory scored his second for SWFC at Fleetwood last night, stole the ball back from the resulting kickoff, ran it up the pitch and slotted the hat-trick. Actual play time between goals 2 & 3 was roughly 8 seconds. Which players have netted a quicker brace? “Last Saturday, Exeter scored 25 seconds after their opponents, Northampton, had a goal disallowed. Is this a record?” wonders Chris Whiffin. @TheKnowledge_GU - I wonder what the record is for football (excluding games like Testimonials)? “Due to the odd number of teams in the National League this year, King’s Lynn Town will finish their season a week before everyone else, on 7 May. At this point, my team, Stockport County, will still have three matches left to play. Has any other team ever finished its league season when another team in the same division still has three or more matches left to play?” asks Ian Waterhouse. Dear @TheKnowledge_GU! Bryne of the Norwegian second division have now lost 1-2 five times in a row. What is the record for most consecutive defeats by the same scoreline? “If Nottingham Forest are promoted to the Premier League and Notts County remain in the National League, would this create the biggest difference in league positions between two local rivals who had played in the same league before?” muses Makoto.

5/4/2022,"Iam a ridiculously early person. If possible, I tend to be at least 30 minutes early for everything. These days, this is an excuse to get some extra reading time; it used to be an opportunity for a glass of wine to settle my nerves when jumping into a party. On the night in question, I was almost an hour early and could not locate an open pub. I was in a part of east London that I had never visited, and I didn’t even know the host of the party, Charlie. I only knew the guy who had invited me, and he wasn’t likely to arrive for another hour or two. So I went to Charlie’s house. To get me out of the way while he finished setting up, he took me to the spare bedroom and introduced me to his new French bulldog puppy. I fell in love immediately. I spent the entire night in the room with the puppy. For seven years in my 20s, I worked as a European sales rep for a celebrity photography agency, travelling almost all of the time and barely spending enough time at home to switch laundry, let alone have a boyfriend or a steady routine. But I had recently changed jobs and was working on a magazine; my hours had settled. That evening at the party, I realised I was finally ready for the one thing that I had always wanted: a pup. I grew up with a springer spaniel named Lacy, who used to get jealous of the books I read and put her paw in the middle of the page to draw my attention. Towards the end of her life, at the beginning of my senior year in high school, she got into bed with me. Upset by this unusual behaviour, I woke my mom; she reasoned that my bed was lower than the bed where Lacy had slept for my entire life and so was easier on the old girl’s hips. Lacy spent that final year that I lived at home sleeping with me every night. She died in my first weekend away at college and her gentle, silly ways have stayed with me. To have a puppy of my own: that was the dream. But was it selfish? Could I handle the responsibility? The plan had a lot of things going for it. I lived opposite the Royal Veterinary College. The house I lived in had a dog door in the back – and I had already settled on a name. My flatmate and I were obsessed with The Wire and I thought naming a dog McNulty would be a brilliant barometer for future romantic and platonic friends. I just had to convince my flatmate that I was ready for the imagined McNulty. That night at the party, I decided that it was time. I was ready. I found a breeder a few weeks later and was put on a waiting list. I met the mother dog and did all the health checks prior to meeting my pup. My McNulty is a cavalier King Charles spaniel and a smaller version of Lacy – same colouring and markings. I didn’t even realise I had copied her until my sister pointed it out. It is now 13 years later. McNults and I have been through jobs, loves, my mother dying, my quitting booze and her enlarged heart. We have been through life together. She is now in a dog buggy, as she can’t walk for very long and it is the best way to keep her with me for as much of the day as possible. We have come as a pair for the past 13 years. Yes, I am that crazy dog lady; when I say “we”, I mean me and McNults. Our social gatherings almost all shifted to dog-friendly venues and she is a “dogmother” to a friend’s daughter. She has been on Sky News, she is a Moshling (for those of you who remember Moshi Monsters) and she makes a cameo in Dolly Alderton’s book Everything I Know About Love. She has been my absolute constant. We are inseparable. Adopting her is the best decision I ever made. McNulty got me through the worst period of my life, through grief, and now I will be with her as her life comes to an end. We stop in my local pub every night as our landlady, Lisa, gives her lots of biscuits while I have a Diet Coke. She taps on the door as we walk by (even if the pub isn’t open). I know I don’t have long left with her, but she has been so loved and treasured. She is irreplaceable. Oh, and yes, she has met the real McNulty (the actor Dominic West) – and the picture was my Christmas card. Not sure she was bothered.",Lifestyle/Life and style,A moment that changed me: I went to a party – and spent all evening with the host’s puppy,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/04/a-moment-that-changed-me-party-host-puppy-mcnulty-king-charles-spaniel
5/4/2022,"A death row inmate in Arizona has two weeks to decide whether to be executed with cyanide gas, the poison known as Zyklon B used by the Nazis to murder millions of people in Auschwitz and other extermination camps. On Tuesday the supreme court of Arizona issued an execution warrant for Frank Atwood that, barring last-minute appeals, will see him put to death on 8 June. The prisoner now has until 19 May to choose his preferred method of death – either lethal injection or hydrogen cyanide, a poisonous gas made notorious by the Nazis as a mass killing technique during the Holocaust. Atwood’s lawyers are scrambling to try and persuade the condemned man not to opt for cyanide. They point out that the last time Arizona used the gas to kill two prisoners in the 1990s it led to gruesome and prolonged deaths lasting in one case 18 minutes, during which time the prisoner was observed to suffer “agonizing choking and gagging”. “Cyanide is as bad as everybody thinks it is – there’s a reason the Nazis used it: it’s a horrific way to die,” said Joseph Perkovich of Phillips Black, a member of Atwood’s legal team. “We are now in the position of having to dissuade our client from opting to go into a cyanide gas chamber, and we have 15 days to do it.” Arizona is the only state in the union that has a working gas chamber, though seven states have lethal gas in some form on their execution protocols. Last year, the Guardian revealed that the Arizona department of corrections had dusted off its gas chamber in Florence which had been unused for two decades, and had spent more than $2,000 procuring the ingredients of cyanide gas. The news provoked outrage among Auschwitz survivors in Germany and Israel. Now Atwood is faced with the choice of dying under this method. Should he take the cyanide option, he would become the first person this century to be executed using the “Holocaust gas”. Atwood’s late mother, Alice, came from a Jewish family in Vienna. She fled Austria in 1939, escaping Gestapo persecution and possible murder in the Nazi gas chambers. Perkovich described the decision bearing down on his client as a Hobson’s choice. The alternative death protocol allowed by Arizona – lethal injection – also holds out the prospect of an agonizing and torturous death. Confusion reigns over the lethal drugs that the state intends to use in executions. Arizona has acquired batches of the sedative pentobarbital through secretive channels using a compounding pharmacy, and lawyers question whether the drugs are fit for use in an execution. In addition, Atwood has degeneration of his spine that would cause him excruciating pain were he to be strapped to the gurney during the lethal injection process. “Every second on that table will be agonizing due to the severe spinal stenosis afflicting no less than 16 openings where his nerves exit his spine,” Perkovich said. The last time that Arizona carried out an execution, in July 2014, it took almost two hours to kill Joseph Wood using a cocktail of lethal drugs. The prisoner was injected 15 times but continued to gasp and gulp a total of 660 times. Atwood, 66, was sentenced to death for killing an eight-year-old girl, Vicki Lynne Hoskinson, in 1984. He has consistently claimed that he is innocent of the murder. Perkovich said the condemned man was resigned to his imminent execution, buoyed up by his strong faith as a devout Greek Orthodox Christian. “He is more prepared to meet his end than anybody I know,” the lawyer said. But he added that the prospect of dying in torturous agony from cyanide was a complicating factor. Atwood wishes to receive his last rites, and as such needs to be lucid at that moment rather than disassociating from pain. Before Atwood’s scheduled execution, a second Arizona death row inmate is set to be put to death. Clarence Dixon has an execution warrant for 11 May for the 1977 murder of a student, Deana Bowdoin. He will be administered lethal injection as the default execution method after he declined to specify his preferred technique. Atwood’s lawyers are so concerned by what they consider to be the unacceptable choice between cyanide gas and potentially faulty lethal drugs that they have proposed that the state’s law is amended to allow him to be killed by firing squad. That would have the benefit of being simple and transparent, they say. Perkovich, a prominent lawyer who has dedicated years to representing death row inmates, said that he and his co-counsel now found themselves in the bizarre situation of having to give legal advice on how to kill a man. “Our responsibilities to the client include advising him which violent, extremely painful way to die he should choose. What does that do to us? I’m speechless. There really aren’t words.”",News/US news,Death row inmate’s dreadful dilemma: lethal drugs or cyanide used by Nazis,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/04/arizona-death-row-execution-cyanide-gas-frank-atwood
5/4/2022,"The owner of Capital FM and LBC told its journalists to avoid reporting allegations of sexual misconduct against the DJ Tim Westwood, who presents a show on another of the company’s outlets, according to staff at the company. It is understood that Global is also dealing with questions from its employees over whether the business looked into anonymous allegations about Westwood that were widely circulated on social media in 2020 – which were denied at the time. Staff in Global’s newsroom – which provides news bulletins for the company’s radio stations including LBC, Capital, and Classic FM – were told last week by managers to avoid mentioning the allegations about Westwood, according to sources at the company. Some presenters on its radio stations were also advised not to discuss the accusations on air. While other media outlets reported on the joint investigation by the Guardian and the BBC, listeners to Global’s outlets do not appear to have been informed of the claims as management worked out how to handle the story, according to multiple sources. The recent investigation into Westwood has also prompted staff at Global to question whether the company acted on previous anonymous social media accusations. Global is a giant in the British commercial media world, and has recently hired big name journalists from the BBC such as Emily Maitlis and Andrew Marr. Yet despite its commercial success, Global avoids much of the attention received by public broadcasters such as the BBC, partly because it is privately owned by the family of founderits founder, Ashley Tabor-King. The Guardian went to Global for comment soon after publishing its investigation into Westwood last Tuesday. The following day the company announced it was temporarily parting ways with Westwood, who has presented a Saturday night show on its Capital Xtra station for the past decade. However, this is not the first time Global has been alerted to accusations about the presenter. A number of anonymous allegations of inappropriate behaviour about Westwood circulated on social media in June 2020. Back then staff at Capital Xtra told the Guardian that they had asked management to investigate the social media accusations – claims that were strongly denied by Westwood. Several Capital Xtra presenters went further and publicly tweeted that they would seek answers from Global management. Leah Davis, who presents a late night Capital Xtra show, wrote in 2020 that she had seen claims of “some terrifying and stomach turning accounts” and would be “doing what I can to make sure this is addressed”. Her message was retweeted by fellow presenters Yinka Bokinni and Shayna Marie, and the weekend afternoon host Robert Bruce. Other staff at the station liked and retweeted messages expressing support for black women, while the presenter Remel London posted at the time: “Trust me when I say we’re not being silent! We want answers too!” A spokesperson for Global declined to comment on any of the claims in this article. When the Guardian approached Global about the anonymous claims on social media about Westwood two years ago, it declined to comment and said it was “of paramount importance” that the company was not quoted as having dismissed the anonymous accusations. Global was aware of the claims in 2020 because it had to apologise after the official Capital Xtra Twitter account blocked a number of individuals making allegations about Westwood’s sexual behaviour – blaming an “error of judgment” by Westwood’s team, who had been handed control of the station’s social media account. At the time Global’s spokesperson would not say whether it was investigating allegations against Westwood, although it is understood the company had not received any formal complaints. A spokesperson for Westwood has denied all the allegations in the recent joint Guardian and BBC investigation and said the claims were completely false.",News/Media,"Capital owner told journalists not to report Tim Westwood accusations, staff say",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/04/capital-owner-told-journalists-not-to-report-tim-westwood-accusations-staff-say
5/4/2022,"Many Conservative MPs would dump Boris Johnson in a flash if they could name the obvious successor. That is the wrong test. The replacement options become clear only once there is a vacancy, and obvious successors rarely succeed anyway. Westminster has buried many uncrowned dauphins. There are other questions the Tories should be asking themselves. One is how much the opposition wants Johnson to stay. A lot, is the answer. For as long as Downing Street is occupied by a man who broke the law and lied about it, the government’s message is corrupted. A dismal TV interview on Tuesday illustrated the problem. The prime minister had to begin by asserting his honesty, which is not something any politician can self-certify. He was then unable to summon plausible empathy for people feeling the strain from rising living costs. Asked about the plight of a 77-year-old woman who could not afford to feed herself and who spent her days travelling on buses to keep warm, the prime minister’s response was to claim credit – falsely – for introducing the subsidised transport regime that made her desolate journeys possible. It was a revealing moment not because it was insensitive or dishonest, although it was both. The telling feature was Johnson’s compulsion to relate the question back to the only issue in which he can sustain any interest – himself. Narcissism was less toxic when its bearer radiated good cheer. “Boris” the eternal optimist was a character who melted hard questions with a sunny disposition. But that persona has a twin, a sullen figure mostly hidden from the public eye but familiar to Downing Street insiders. This is brooding, needy Boris. He is always feeling betrayed and unappreciated. He is the kind of man who resents having his limelight blocked by a cold, hungry pensioner. Whichever Johnson is on display, his ego hogs all the political bandwidth available for the Conservative party. That poses a dilemma for MPs. They can have an agenda to address the country’s economic and social needs, or they can spend their energy deflecting and dissimulating to cover for their delinquent leader. They cannot easily do both. Actually, there is a third-way option. It involves pretending to be serious about government and hoping that something turns up. That method has served Johnson well enough in his career to date. A bet against him making a comeback is never safe. Local elections this week are forecast to go against the Tories, but not on the scale that would allow Johnson’s enemies to extrapolate certain general election carnage. A swing to Labour in line with current opinion polls would amount to a normal midterm punishment beating for an incumbent administration, not a seismic event. Keir Starmer has successfully stabilised his party’s position by neutralising the most voter-repellent properties of Corbynism, but Labour doesn’t exude the dynamic drive of a project poised for power. Effective opposition leaders have a way of galvanising general political malaise into impatience for regime change, and making themselves the obvious vehicle to achieve it. That energy is available to Starmer, but still untapped. He needs less of it with Johnson in Downing Street. Many Tories privately recognise that the Labour leader is morally and professionally more suitable for high office. That doesn’t stop them campaigning for their party, but it makes them less effective. As some Labour MPs found under Jeremy Corbyn, it is hard to be persuasive on the doorstep when you think your leader is unfit to be prime minister. Even the hardcore Johnson loyalists don’t look to him for leadership or principle. His merit in their eyes is the absence of both qualities. The right wing in particular likes the way he yields to pressure, like political memory foam, shaping the government’s plans to the ideological contours of the body that most recently sat on him. There is also a cadre of over-promoted mediocrities – the likes of Nadine Dorries and Jacob Rees-Mogg, too many to list them all – whose function in Johnson’s cabinet is to be grateful that the bar was set low enough for their admittance. That is a legacy of Brexit. It is the consequence of building an administration around an idea that made no sense as a plan for practical government. The price of joining Team Boris was giving up a place on Team Economic Reality, which diminished the pool of available talent. Johnson has undoubted political successes to his name, but they are campaign credits: two London mayoral elections; the Brexit referendum; the 2019 general election. The periods in between have been a mishmash of indolence, prevarication and scandal. He has bounced back before, but he has never previously had his morose, self-pitying persona exposed to as much scrutiny as its jovial, ebullient “Boris” alter ego. As prime minister, there is nowhere to hide. Tory MPs might also want to interrogate the sustainability of a political strategy built on one man’s unique ability to borrow votes from people who have never liked their party. Post-Johnson, London is Labour again. There are plausible grounds to think that the 2019 general electoral gains are more durable – that a profound cultural realignment occurred over Brexit in places where Labour support had decayed over many years. But if that were certain, Tories would be less fixated on the charismatic electoral voodoo that was their reason for making Johnson leader in the first place. Fear that no one could repeat the trick is their unvoiced reason for keeping him. That anxiety speaks volumes about the demoralisation and intellectual debilitation of many Conservative MPs. They have no respect for their leader, yet they are unable to imagine what they would be without him.

5/4/2022,"The last po’ouli died in an unusual nest. Too weak to perch, the brownish-greyish songbird rested in a small towel twisted into a ring. He was the last of his species, the last in fact of an entire group of finches, and occurred nowhere on Earth outside its native Hawaii. For weeks, as scientists tried to find him a mate, he had been getting sicker. The only remaining po’ouli had just one eye. Alone in the towel, alone in all the world, he closed it. He was born, like all po’ouli (pronounced po-oh-oo-lee), in Maui’s Hana rainforest, on the slopes of Mount Haleakalā – “house of the sun” – where it rains all the time. Also known as the blackfaced honeycreeper, his species was discovered in 1973. Then, researchers estimated the total population at 200 birds. Scholar Mary Kawena Pukui gave the bird its name, meaning “black head”. Her book of Hawaiian proverbs includes this one: Hāhai nō ka ua i ka ululāʻau, “the rain follows the forest”. The phrase has a double meaning: it is a hint and warning. To find water, look for forests. But also: should one element of an ecosystem be destroyed, others will surely follow. By 1997, just five po’ouli remained. That year, on an unusually bright day, researchers caught one for the first time. It had taken Paul Baker, a British ecologist a long way from home, half of every month for two years. Climbing up and down Mount Haleakalā’s muddy hills meant that at just 33, he would soon need a knee operation. But it was worth it. After untangling the po’ouli from a mist net, Baker took the bird’s measurements and charted its colours. The po’ouli weighed just 26.2g, or less than 1oz. The shades of his brown feathers alone included umber, raw sepia, ground colour sepia, warm sepia, sienna, antique brown, cinnamon, dark cinnamon, hair brown, mars brown, warm buff, olive brown, Prout’s brown, Vandyke brown, Natal brown, Verona brown, army brown and dull brown-black. Holding the po’ouli in one hand, Baker photographed him with the other: the bird is seen upright and from the back, his head turned to the side, as though modelling a coat worn just off his shoulders. Baker released the po’ouli, but the bird stuck around. From a branch six feet away he looked at the man as if to say, “Who are you? What have you just done? What are you?”. Then the po’ouli flew off into the rainforest. What we know about how he and the rest of his species spent their time there is very little. They flew and foraged and slept through almost 500 inches of rain (12 times the average annual rainfall of New York state). The quietest of all Hawaiian honeycreepers, they rarely sang or chirped. They ate small land snails, beetles and butterfly larvae. But snails had been growing harder to find, thanks to European domestic pigs and black rats who disturbed the forest floor where birds foraged. The pigs, the rats, cats and mongoose who likely preyed on po’ouli and their eggs were all brought to the island decades earlier by humans, as were mosquitoes, which carry avian malaria. Invasive species have caused a third of the world’s extinctions since 1500. Hawaii alone has lost two-thirds of its endemic bird species. By the new millennium, there were just three po’ouli left. Though they lived just a few kilometres from one another, they are unlikely ever to have met. Instead – perhaps out of loneliness, perhaps out of confusion – each spent time with yellowish, hook-beaked Maui parrotbills, which had a similar call. Meanwhile, conservationists, ornithologists and ecologists sent frantic emails, held tense meetings, and pulled each other aside at conferences, fretting and fighting over what to do and who would pay for it. It took three years – or roughly a third of a po’ouli life – to reach a decision. In 2002, researchers captured what they hoped was a female. After feeding her two snails and 15 waxworms, they released her into the territory of what they believed was the last remaining male. The transplanted female embarked on her blind date at dusk. At dawn, she began to fly home, as unaware of the male po’ouli existence as he was of hers. In 2004, the po’ouli got one last chance. It took six people 18 months and $300,000 to catch a bird. It was, remarkably, the same individual that Baker had snared seven years previously, when he became the first person to hold a live po’ouli. In that time, the bird had lost an eye. He was old – at least nine – and found captivity stressful. He died in Maui 11 weeks later, between 10pm and 11.30pm, on 26 November, of multiple (tiny) organ failure. He was the last po’ouli ever seen. Researchers hoping to catch a female could not find either of the remaining birds. In 2019, the International Union for Conservation of Nature declared the species extinct. “When you get too involved with something like that, it can’t help but sort of change you personally,” said Baker recently. His voice wobbled and he began to cry. “I’m actually really upset right now, thinking about it,” he said. “I remember the day I heard the bird had died and, stupid as it sounds, I wept for the species.” He sniffed. “And I’m crying for it again now, all these years later.”",News/Environment,Extinction obituary: why experts weep for the quiet and beautiful Hawaiian po’ouli,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/04/extinction-obituary-hawaiian-poouli-bird-aoe
5/4/2022,"Manchester, 1976, in a flat above a fish shop that reeked so badly even thieves wouldn’t approach it, John McGeoch obsessively hammered away at his guitar. When the electricity meter ran out he would play for hours unamplified in complete darkness. McGeoch was a Scottish fine art student and when his flatmate Malcolm Garrett (who would design artwork for Buzzcocks, Duran Duran and Simple Minds) told Howard Devoto, who’d recently quit punk pioneers Buzzcocks, that McGeoch could play all the parts of Television’s Marquee Moon, Devoto was impressed. “That made me think he would be somebody worth knowing,” he recalls in The Light Pours Out of Me, a new biography on McGeoch by Rory Sullivan-Burke. The pair connected and this materialised into Magazine and their revelatory debut single Shot By Both Sides. Despite the riff being a hand-me-down from Buzzcocks, McGeoch’s playing on it – as urgent and taut as it was fluid and melodic – quickly grabbed people. Siouxsie Sioux recalled: “everyone was saying: ‘who is playing guitar in Magazine?’” It captivated a teenage Johnny Marr. “Shot By Both Sides was so arresting,” he tells me. “The sound and attitude was very modern – it sounded like it had an agenda.” The track was a line in the sand for Marr. “Punk wasn’t the letter A in a new alphabet, it was Z in the old lexicon and then after was a clean slate.” McGeoch was operating at an elevated level for the times, according to Marr. “He took that artistic big bang [punk] into something so much more than just barre chord thrash,” he says. “He wasn’t pretending to be in some crap spitting punk band. He wasn’t joining in the dumbing down brigade. His intention was to be modern and you hear that in the very deliberate choice of using the flanger on everything.” The flanger – normally a foot pedal, used to bend the notes of a guitar – was customised by McGeoch. He adapted it to be attached to a mic stand and controlled by hand, allowing greater control and resulting in a ringing, icy sound that had both cinematic scope and a fierce crunch. “John’s playing was a deliberate modernism,” says Marr. “The flanger modulates the signal so that it wobbles, and the effect is psychedelic. Not ‘oh so trippy 60s man’ or Hendrix, but psychedelic like you’ve taken bad acid or been psychotic after three days of speed.” Across three albums – Real Life, Secondhand Daylight and The Correct Use of Soap – McGeoch’s playing was an electric presence. “I had the fortune to watch him execute his talent in the most incredibly dexterous way,” recalls Magazine’s Barry Adamson. “He seemed to be able to take on anything that came to his mind. I didn’t see him struggle.” McGeoch was a versatile player, gliding between sparkling arpeggios, ripping riffs, or simply adding subtle colour, balancing deftness and potency. “John’s playing helped shape the new wave musical landscape by finding a new place for guitar,” says James Dean Bradfield of the Manic Street Preachers. “Its place became less vainglorious, less heroic perhaps, but still strident, articulate and aggressive when it needed to be.” The Correct Use of Soap was deemed a masterpiece by many, including Marr. It obsessed a 10-year-old Jonny Greenwood who played it on repeat and took notes, but McGeoch was frustrated by the band’s lack of commercial success. McGeoch, Adamson and Magazine keyboard player Dave Formula were poached to play in Visage, who quickly had huge success, providing McGeoch with financial stability as well as a taste for fine wine. But there was another band who wanted him: Siouxsie and the Banshees. They had just lost their guitarist and drummer and while still with Magazine he was invited to play on Happy House, immediately making an impact with a shimmering guitar line that snakes through the song. He was eventually convinced to make the switch permanent in 1980. “The Banshees were his mistress and eventually we got him to leave his wife,” Steven Severin of the band says. “It was like getting George Best on guitar,” says Marr. “There was a huge gaping hole [in Magazine] as soon as he left,” says Adamson. “It changed the course of the band forever and helped it to its place of ultimate derailment.” Magazine were over a year later. The albums Kaleidoscope, Juju and A Kiss in the Dreamhouse marked a hugely fertile period for the Banshees with McGeoch-powered tracks such as Spellbound invoking “pure invention, grace and bloodlust ballet” according to Bradfield. Marr adds: “The music he made with the Banshees … the word imperial was made for that music.” However, despite the creative peaks, McGeoch’s thirst for booze – which was already plentiful – was increasing, and cocaine was thrown into the mix. Things imploded in 1982 in Madrid when McGeoch was in such bad shape he was playing the wrong songs on stage. “It became obvious that he didn’t know where he was,” Banshees drummer Budgie later said. “I thought he’d just gone too far that night, but much later he admitted that he’d been given a Valium to calm his nerves, cos he was shaking either from withdrawal or too much drinking. If we’d been noticing this we might have said the show can’t go on. But we weren’t.” McGeoch ended up in addiction clinic the Priory but was fired by the band after they visited him and instead of being in hospital he’d gone to the pub with the day release patients. “It sounds very callous,” Sioux has said of the move. “I wish it hadn’t happened. But alcoholism is not something that gets fixed overnight.” Severin reflects on the decision: “40 years ago the term rehab was not used yet; there were no support systems available, especially in the music industry. For all we knew John was effectively committed to an asylum until further notice.” McGeoch then joined the Armoury Show with ex-Magazine drummer John Doyle and ex-Skids members Richard Jobson and Russell Webb. However, yet another iconic post-punk band wanted him: Public Image Ltd. He lasted six years but it wasn’t an auspicious start. Early on his first tour in Austria a rowdy crowd, still acting out the cartoon version of punk, were spitting and throwing things. McGeoch confronted them and in return got a 1.5 litre wine bottle – stolen from PiL’s dressing room – launched into his face. This resulted in laser surgery and 44 stitches; bandmates think he lost about a pint of blood before he could even get off stage. It wasn’t the first time McGeoch had intervened in the audience’s idiotic parroting of punk’s heyday, once climbing into the crowd at a Banshees show to rip off a Nazi armband. The wine bottle incident rocked him, though, and people noticed a distinct change in him. PiL came to an end when Lydon accepted a solo deal. McGeoch was a martial arts expert and when he was told by the band’s manager there was no new album deal and PiL was effectively over, he later told a friend that he contemplated taking him out to the pub car park and killing him. Instead, he walked away. He tried to get a band off the ground with Heaven 17’s Glenn Gregory but it never happened and he retreated from music, focused on family life and trained as a nurse. He returned to music later on, writing theme tunes for Channel 5, but at just 48 he died of Sudep (sudden unexpected death in epilepsy). Alcohol had remained a major problem but he was sober in the final months of his life. “John’s approach to playing helped define an entire genre of music that came after punk,” says his biographer Sullivan-Burke. The simplicity of his playing, combined with a technical ability that never veered into needless virtuosity, inspired many from 1990s American grunge and alt-rock to British pop. “He chose very simple lines over anything bombastic,” Roddy Frame of Aztec Camera once said. “He was kind of a guitar antihero, the song came first and he tried to complement that.” Steve Albini emulated some of his playing in his pulverising noise rock band Big Black. “He was an innovator with the pure sound of his guitar,” he tells me. “I admire the economy of his playing. He made very precise choices that were usually beautifully simple.” He also shaped one of the Manic Street Preachers’ most beloved records. “John was a massive influence on The Holy Bible,” says Bradfield. “Being a fan of Magazine and the Banshees prepared me so well for that album without really realising it at the time.” After his death Sioux reflected on his talent and impact in the Banshees. “John McGeoch was my favourite guitarist of all time,” she said. “He was into sound in an almost abstract way. I loved the fact that I could say, ‘I want this to sound like a horse falling off a cliff’, and he would know exactly what I meant. He was easily, without a shadow of a doubt, the most creative guitarist the Banshees ever had.”",Arts/Music,"‘Invention, grace and bloodlust ballet’: post-punk guitarist John McGeoch",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/04/post-punk-guitarist-john-mcgeoch-magazine-siouxsie-sioux
5/4/2022,"A man riding an electric scooter has died in Perth after colliding with a cyclist early on Wednesday morning. Police say about 2.25am on Wednesday, the 46-year-old man on the scooter crashed into a cyclist on a blind bend on the corner of Nicholson and Yale roads in Thornlie. The rider of the e-scooter was rushed to Fiona Stanley hospital with critical injuries, where he later died. The cyclist, a 52-year-old man, received minor injuries and was treated at the scene. A spokesperson from the West Australian police force said whether the e-scooter rider was wearing a helmet would form part of their investigation. Madison Bland, a PhD candidate at Griffith University’s Cities Research Institute, said e-scooters were increasing in popularity in urban centres as an alternative form of transport for short trips of 1-5km. “They’re quick and efficient – with recent fuel shocks and price spikes they’re a lot more affordable, and the lithium battery provides emission-free travel,” he said. “We’ve seen people from all age brackets upwards of 16 take to e-scooters within the private market, and now with the rollout of public sharing services … they’re nimble and efficient.” E-bikes and scooters that comply to certain European standards are allowed on public roads in Australia under similar rules to bicycles. The legality of riding e-scooters is dependent on each state and territory’s frameworks, however Western Australia, Queensland, the ACT and Tasmania have the least prohibitive regulations. Stirling was the first Perth council to launch a shared e-scooter scheme last February, when it implemented a 12 month e-scooter trial with the city’s approved operator Neuron Mobility. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning New laws introduced in the state last December limit e-scooters to a maximum speed of 25 km/h on suburban roads and bike paths and 10km/h on footpaths. It is illegal to ride them on main roads. The New South Wales government recently announced it would join the majority of states and territories and hold a 12 month e-scooter trial later this year, focusing on ensuring regulations were “sensible and appropriate”. NSW is the only state where e-bikes are still prohibited in public. Bland said despite regulations, the private market sold vehicles that could reach speeds in excess of 60 km/hr, and said councils and governments should consider dedicated infrastructure to cater to the new form of transport. “There’s a concern for regulators to talk to these private suppliers and build into the system the need for safer vehicles so we can limit these conflicts,” he said. “We also have to look to the infrastructure provision and how our urban areas cater to these vehicles … and have a serious discussion about dedicated, physically separated lanes to support micro-mobility. “It’s a very new vehicle type, there’s a period of transition where all road users need to get accustomed but … it’s a self fulfilling prophecy – if you provide safe infrastructure, it will provide greater incentive to ride and so [you get] safety in numbers.” An International Transport Forum report suggested riding e-scooters came with a comparable risk to cycling, ranging between 78 and 100 fatalities per billion trips. Royal Perth hospital figures provided to the West Australian showed 44 people had been admitted to the state trauma ward for injuries sustained in e-scooter crashes since 2019. Eighteen of the 44 patients weren’t wearing helmets at the time of their crash, while alcohol and/or drugs were a factor in 15 of the 44 cases. In February, a 13-year-old boy died in hospital after an electric scooter crash in Perth’s north, prompting his father to issue an urgent plea for helmet safety. At the time, the state’s road safety commissioner, Adrian Warner, said it was a heartbreaking reminder the devices must be used “safely and sensibly”. “Like bicycle riders, like motorcycle riders, like pedestrians, riders of e-scooters are vulnerable,” he said. “They will come off second best in any crash with a motor vehicle.”",News/Australia news,Man riding electric scooter dies after collision with cyclist in Perth,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/04/man-riding-electric-scooter-dies-after-collision-with-cyclist-in-perth
5/4/2022,"Good morning. Feeling chilly? Well, don’t touch the thermostat. Soaring energy prices have been at the forefront of everyone’s mind in recent months: eye-watering bills, inflation, and a rise in national insurance have all compounded to create what has been described as the sharpest drop in living standards in decades. But as British consumers feel the squeeze, energy giant BP yesterday reported soaring underlying profits of $6.2bn (£4.9bn) – more than doubling last year’s $2.6bn. The story features on the front pages of the Guardian and the Mirror. It’s the kind of announcement that feels precision engineered to drive you up the wall – and it’s re-energised the debate around a windfall tax on energy companies – something the Labour party has been calling for. But how would it work in practice? And would it benefit those most in need? I spoke to Stuart Adam, a senior economist from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, and Mathew Lawrence, founder and director of progressive think tank Common Wealth, about the problems it solves, and the problems it doesn’t. First though, the headlines: Ukraine | The EU is expected to announce oil sanctions against Moscow after Russian forces shelled and tried to storm the Azovstal steelworks, the last holdout of Ukrainian troops defending the southern port city of Mariupol. Abortion | Joe Biden has warned that a leaked draft supreme court ruling which would remove the right to an abortion in the US represents “a fundamental shift” in American law. Biden spoke as the court’s chief justice John Roberts ordered an investigation into the leak. Politics | Tory MPs, angered by Boris Johnson’s handling of a TV interview on the cost of living crisis, have warned that he may be harming their local election prospects. One said that some voters have “a Boris problem”. Coronavirus | An elderly person was put in a body bag in Shanghai before mortuary workers noticed they were still alive. The incident sparked a furious backlash in the city, five weeks into a gruelling lockdown. Housing | Typical green space near new homes has shrunk by about 40% since 2000, a new study has found. The authors said property developers have claimed they cannot afford to build new parks as part of developments. Basically, a windfall tax is a one-off levy that the government imposes on a sector that has made huge profits from something that they were not responsible for. To pluck a couple of examples out of nowhere, that might mean a profit caused by a huge increase in demand after a pandemic, or a war. “You can make a case that a windfall tax has to be [brought in] retrospectively here because no one could have predicted that Russia would invade Ukraine,” Stuart Adam of the IFS tells me. But a company like BP might dispute the idea that it’s not a normal part of the fluctuations of their business: “When you’re investing in North Sea oil and gas, you know that oil and gas prices are volatile, and they go up and down for all sorts of reasons and geopolitical events.” “People do need to understand that part of the risk they’re taking is the risk on the upside,” he says. Energy companies might experience a big loss – as they did at early in the pandemic when oil prices fell below zero – or they might gain from them in a big way. This “asymmetry”, as Stuart calls it, supports an argument BP might make about the fairness of a windfall tax policy. “No one’s proposing a one off windfall subsidy when they make a loss… it might discourage investment if energy companies think that if all goes well they’ll get a heavy tax, whereas if it goes badly, they won’t get cushioned.” On the other hand, as Common Wealth’s Mathew Lawrence points out, oil and gas companies benefit from a wide range of tax subsidies – and the UK is already one of most generous fiscal regimes for oil and gas producers. Analysis of OECD data by campaign group Paid to Pollute shows that between 2016 and 2020 oil and gas companies received £13.6bn in subsidies Could it solve the cost of living crisis? Beyond the question of fairness for shareholders, there are the practicalities. It may seem warranted to take a big chunk of money away from fossil fuel companies, but would it work in practice? The Labour party has been a big proponent of a new tax for a while now, arguing earlier this year that oil and gas companies should pay 10% more in corporation tax, which it was estimated would raise £1.2bn in revenue. Labour leader Keir Starmer wasn’t explicit about whether the tax would be permanent or a one-off, but said that the money raised “could be used to keep energy bills down”. And it’s not just the UK: our energy correspondent Alex Lawson has analysed the measures being taken by countries across Europe to tackle the energy and cost of living crises. As yet, the British government has resisted such calls – and it’s impossible to say how much that kind of tax would raise without more specifics. The Guardians financial editor, Nils Pratley, wrote last night that “the little secret about the Labour party’s version of windfall tax is that it is very modest.” But “if you set a pretty chunky tax, then in principle, you could raise enough to make a serious dent,” Stuart tells me. “What you couldn’t do is raise enough just from just oil and gas to protect every household in the country from all rises in the cost of living… but you could be talking about a substantial sum.” Could there be unintended consequences? Unsurprisingly, energy companies aren’t particularly thrilled at the idea, claiming that such a tax would be unfair, reduce their ability to invest in renewables, and is potentially illegal. And there have been suggestions any tax would be felt most keenly by older people, whose pensions are invested in energy company shares. This is something that Mathew Lawrence disputes. “It’s a really dangerous red herring and it’s pushed deliberately by people who are invested in the status quo,” he says. While it’s true that some BP dividends do make their way down to “ordinary pensioners”, Mathew says, for the most part this isn’t how pensions operate in the UK any more. In reality, only 8% of BP and Shell’s shares are owned by the UK pension fund. Are there any alternatives? The nature of a one-off tax means that the behaviour of these giant oil and gas companies is unlikely to change. That’s helpful if your goal is to extract an immediate financial benefit without harming their businesses, but it does little to incentivise a more serious approach to the climate crisis. In that context, many have asked: why not just increase corporation tax for the energy sector permanently? Currently oil and gas companies pay 40% in corporation tax, double what companies in other sectors pay. However, this number doesn’t paint the full picture: there are various tax relief schemes in place, which mean that oil and gas companies barely pay any tax on North Sea gas and oil at the moment. Adam believes there is a pretty compelling argument for just such an increase. Because the sector in the UK is inextricably tied to the North Sea, “the worry about needing to keep corporation tax rate internationally competitive just doesn’t really apply”. Then there’s the point that the way corporation tax works with offshore oil and gas is different to other sectors “because the investment costs are deductible, and that means that you can have a higher tax rate without discouraging investment,” he explains. It is important to point out that while BP’s profits in the North Sea are important, they’re also a relatively small part of its bottom line. Ultimately, if we want to deal with the dual crises of unsustainable costs of living and the climate crisis, a windfall tax simply isn’t enough. For Lawrence, there are fundamental problems about hitching our future to companies like BP or Shell because, to him, “the for-profit private company or corporation is structurally ill equipped to drive an energy transition in a world in which fossil fuels have higher profitability rates than renewable energy projects.” A windfall tax might provide some cash to allow the government to alleviate sky-high energy bills – but there are some credible arguments on the other side, too. Either way, until government gets serious about investing in a greener energy policy, our bills (and the health of the planet) will remain subject to the whim of the oil and gas giants. After yesterday’s newsletter on the extraordinary leak of a draft US supreme court decision which would overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling that enshrined the constitutional right to abortion, we thought it’d be useful to point out some responses to the news in the Guardian and elsewhere: Experts warn that as well as an immediate ban on abortion in much of America, the decision could lead to bans on women travelling out of state for an abortion, too. Meanwhile, the Washington Post reports that anti-abortion activists may now push for a strict nationwide ban. “So here we are again,” writes Marina Hyde. “Today, there is a sense that even restating the arguments feels like something pro-choice women have been doing every day of every decade since they apparently won the argument.” Jessica Bruder’s long piece in the Atlantic, published in April, is an extraordinary survey of a mobilising network of covert abortion providers ready to step in as state-regulated access disappears. This Twitter thread by a historian of the religious right, Neil J Young, explains how varied Christian conservative views on abortion were before a political movement started to build in the 1970s. In the US conservative magazine the National Review, David Harsanyi writes that voters will not be motivated by the decision in the midterm elections. Claiming “little will functionally change”, he predicts that voters “will likely turn back to worrying about inflation and energy prices.” Walls, ‘gates’ and Britain’s local elections Whether its a focus on the ‘red wall’ or the ‘blue wall’, Partygate or Tractorgate, local elections are an important guide to the prospects of the national government and opposition alike, says Heather Stewart Rory Carroll’s report on Sinn Féin’s strategy to win power in Thursday’s Northern Ireland assembly election explains why the party is being ultra-cautious as it stands on the brink of victory.
