3/22/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. ramped up its share buyback program to $25 billion, expanding that arsenal for a second time in less than a year to stanch a $470 billion loss of value during Beijing’s internet crackdown.

It also appointed a new independent director in Shan Weijian, chairman of alternative asset management house PAG. Shan, a longtime investor in Chinese companies, will replace Ericsson Chief Executive Officer Börje Ekholm from March 31. Alibaba’s up-sized buyback represents one of the largest shareholder-reward programs in China’s giant internet industry, and coincides with a re-calibration of sentiment after Xi Jinping and his deputy Liu He pledged to support the economy and markets and finish the clampdown on the tech sector “as soon as possible” -- triggering a historic rally in Chinese stocks. Alibaba’s shares gained as much as 5.4% in Hong Kong on Tuesday. China’s largest companies are only just starting to emerge from a year of unparalleled regulatory scrutiny into sectors from online commerce to social media. The buyback “signals where company management sees value, and it may also be a bellwether for where they see regulatory action -- perhaps we are coming closer to the end of it,” said Justin Tang, head of Asian Research at United First Partners in Singapore. Alibaba’s Buyback Hike Adds to China Tech Tailwinds: Street Wrap MS Says China Tech Selloff Far From Over: What to Watch in China Chinese tech corporations have until recently rarely resorted to big shareholder-return programs like dividends or stock repurchases. But the country’s largest corporations have resigned themselves to a new era of cautious expansion, nearly two years into a bruising internet crackdown that quickly engulfed everything from e-commerce to ride-hailing and online education. Alibaba reported its slowest growth on record during the December quarter, and Tencent Holdings Ltd. is expected to do the same on Wednesday. E-commerce rival Pinduoduo Inc. reported revenue that missed estimates for the third straight quarter.

Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang has sketched out how China’s e-commerce leader will now prioritize user retention over acquisition -- a significant shift for a company that achieved massive scale by vanquishing rivals like EBay Inc. and fought rivals in arenas from media to the cloud and commerce. The about-face underscores a growing realization of the speed with which up-and-coming competitors from ByteDance Ltd. to PDD are drawing users from traditional leaders Alibaba and JD.com Inc., even as the Chinese economy struggles to recover during punishing Covid-Zero lockdowns. “The Chinese generally believe you shouldn’t waste the bullet when the tide is against you,” Kamet Capital Partners Chief Investment Officer Kerry Goh said. “Could this be a signal that the management believes the worst is behind them especially since Liu He’s announcement last week?” Read more: Alibaba Plans for New Normal of Low Growth as Crackdown Bites Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Silicon Valley’s Wealthiest Russian Is Carefully—Very Carefully—Distancing Himself From Putin Broke Oligarch Says Sanctioned Billionaires Have No Sway Over Putin The Future of Boosters Is Somewhere Between Unnecessary and Urgent A Once Radical Idea to Close the Wealth Gap Is Actually Happening For Sale: Trudeau’s Oil Pipeline.

3/22/2022,"Farmers worldwide are feeling the sting of sanctions, as the Ukraine War has sent fertilizer prices soaring to new all-time highs, prompting concerns over a global food shortage. Fertilizer prices last week were nearly 10% higher than the week before according to Green Markets North America Fertilizer Price Index, the highest price point ever recorded. Prices are now 40% higher than a month ago, before the invasion of Ukraine. The surge in fertilizer prices reveals how dependent many of the world's farms are on Russian exports. Countries already afflicted by food insecurity now risk further production bottlenecks and food shortages at the worst possible time. The farming industry has been hit hard by the war and the political reaction in Russia to Western sanctions. Russia was the world’s top exporter of fertilizers in 2019, according to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity, when Russia’s trade volume in fertilizer stood at nearly $9 billion. Russia and neighboring Belarus, which has also been hit by sanctions, are key exporters of several critical fertilizing compounds, including urea and potash, but curtailed exports of these products has caused prices to soar. Surging fertilizer prices have also been aggravated by higher costs for natural gas, a critical feedstock in producing nitrogen-based fertilizer, amid a U.S. ban of Russian oil imports and discussions in Europe to decouple from Russian energy. International shipping companies have largely suspended their activities in Russia, bringing global trade to a standstill. And in early March, Russian officials told fertilizer producers in the country to slow their exports in retaliation to Western sanctions. The soaring costs of fertilizers, and other key agricultural commodities like wheat used for cow feed, could have knock-on effects throughout the world. The high prices might lead to severe bottlenecks, severely reducing agricultural production and aggravating what economists have already designated as a global food crisis. Before the invasion of Ukraine, the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization had already warned that “acute food insecurity” was plaguing dozens of countries spanning Latin America, central Africa, the Middle East, and central Asia due to conflict and erratic environmental conditions. The economic fallout of the Ukraine War could further add to this insecurity. “Ukraine has only compounded a catastrophe on top of a catastrophe,” David M. Beasley, executive director of the UN World Food Program, recently told The New York Times, adding that the current levels of food insecurity have not been seen since World War II. The effects of trapped food products in Ukraine and Russia, both of which are global bread baskets, are already being felt in the world's more vulnerable countries. Around 40% of Ukraine's wheat and corn exports are intended for the Middle East and Africa, according to the UN International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), which has expressed concern over how massive price swings for staple crops could affect stability in the region. “I am deeply concerned that the violent conflict in Ukraine, already a catastrophe for those directly involved, will also be a tragedy for the world’s poorest people living in rural areas who cannot absorb the price hikes of staple foods and farming inputs that will result from disruptions to global trade,” said Gilbert F. Houngbo, President of IFAD. “We are already seeing price hikes and this could cause an escalation of hunger and poverty with dire implications for global stability,"" Houngbo said. Brazil, the world’s largest importer of fertilizers, was already expecting low crop yields this year due to an ongoing drought, and is now scrambling to increase domestic production of fertilizing products as it looks to plug the gap left by Russia. Larger producers may be able to weather the storm of higher fertilizer prices, but smallholder and family-run farms who cannot afford higher costs can be hit hard by market volatility of these key products, Svein Tore Holsether, the CEO and president of Norwegian fertilizer giant Yara International, told Fortune at last November’s COP26 climate conference. Natural gas prices were spiking last fall as demand roared back despite low inventory, causing a surge of fertilizer prices. ""I’m afraid we’re going to have a food crisis,"" Holsether said at the time.
