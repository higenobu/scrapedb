2/18/2022,"Vesna Goldsworthy dedicates her third novel to “my friends who, like me, grew up east of that line from Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic”. Her gloriously vivid tale moves from 1981 to 1990, as the Iron Curtain – along with old Soviet certainties – weakens and falls. Its narrator swaps east for west for love, but struggles to find happiness in either. Milena Urbanska is the daughter of the second most powerful man in an unnamed Russian satellite. The state has “staid manners and a miserable coast”, but hers is a life of Ray-Bans, Yves Saint Laurent jerkins and the latest fridge freezers. The barrier to the west may be porous to the powerful, but the listless Milena guards her own privacy with adolescent rigour. She cocoons her black-clad body in neoclassical mansions and lakeside retreats, and shakes with fury when her essay is called out for nepotistic praise at a school ceremony. After her boyfriend (the owner of “the only LP of Evita this side of the Iron Curtain”) dies in an accident, she asks Daddy for a translation job, numbing her trauma with a succession of maize cultivation studies. When a rare literary conference is announced, she agrees to shadow Jason, a visiting English poet.  The man who will change her life arrives in an Aran sweater and plimsolls “the colour of a urine sample”. Jason is glib and charismatic and, drunk on novelty and his handsome, narrow face, Milena falls in love. A few months later she is on a flight to England, where drab skies, mug-strewn bedsits and new threats await. Like her protagonist, Goldsworthy crossed the Iron Curtain in the 1980s, emigrating from Serbia to London to live with her British husband, and working for the BBC before writing memoirs, poetry and now thoughtful, atmospheric novels. She builds her story with wonderfully evocative detail, and as Milena moves from the wary conformity of her homeland to England, bubbles of humour burst through Goldsworthy’s bittersweet brew. On a visit to Jason’s parents’ underheated country pile, his mother wheels out a grimly credible smörgåsbord of burnt brussels sprouts, sulphurous cabbage and “greasy, glistening” dumplings from her many ovens. Goldsworthy gives Milena sharp replies in the face of British pomposity, and merrily punctures the cliches of London romance: in Kensington Gardens, the lovers watch “ducks waddle and defecate around its rim, and adult men play with miniature, remotely controlled sailing boats”. There is escape here, of a kind. Sex with Jason is joyful, and London’s neighbourhood shops offer a comforting sense of community and routine. Babies arrive, “tiny and creased from the pressure of the womb, like two loaves of warm brioche”. In the country, farmhouse-dotted fields stretch wetly “like kelp to an invisible sea”, a lyrical contrast to the war-ravaged land and collective farms of home. But foreboding shadows every finely rendered set piece. It comes from Soviet agents, from the self-centred Jason and from the headstrong, troubled Milena herself. Goldsworthy’s previous novels used a cast of London émigrés to continue the story of Anna Karenina and retell The Great Gatsby. In Iron Curtain, Jason writes a volume of sonnets called The Argonauts, while Milena can be read as a version of Medea, who followed her lover west, and ended her stay with vengeance. By the dawn of the 90s, the great divide that Milena crossed is no more, and scruffy, old-fashioned London is being remade as a financial capital. Even a child of the elite can be marooned as history’s tides turn. Yet, if Iron Curtain is often pessimistic about its lonely heroine’s world, this is no classical tragedy. The pages fly by, and Goldsworthy’s careful scrutiny brings warmth and sympathy to her tale of belonging and betrayal. Tense, brooding and often hilarious, Iron Curtain finds bright sparks as well as bleakness in the cold war’s dying embers.  Iron Curtain is published by Chatto & Windus (£14.99).

2/18/2022,"It’s hard to think of anything less amusing than watching someone you love gasp their last breath of life. Yet, in the opening of Other People, film-maker Chris Kelly manages to turn that searing scene into the stuff of scream-out-loud comedy. Like a lot of humor of the darkest hue, success pivots on the juxtaposition between the monumental and the mundane – in this case involving mortality and a mixed-up Taco Bell order.  The plot of Kelly’s debut film, which was released in 2016, centers on a struggling and downcast comedy writer (played by Jesse Plemons), who reluctantly returns to the place where he grew up, Sacramento, California, to help his sisters and father care for their cancer-ravaged matriarch (the iridescent Molly Shannon). The opening scene makes her tragic fate clear. The rest of the film chronicles the year-long lead-up. The drama of Other People isn’t only about the mother’s decline but about the son’s thwarted ascent; he’s struggling in his career, losing in his love life – having recently broken up with his boyfriend (played by Zach Woods) – and failing in his fitful attempts to get his father to accept his sexuality. The story mirrors Kelly’s own: he grew up in Sacramento, became a comedy writer – though a far more successful one than his character in the movie, having served, for a time, as the head writer of Saturday Night Live – and he lost his mother to cancer in 2009. So, he clearly knows what he’s talking about. Every detail in the film – from the most improbably funny to the most unflinchingly sad – rings true. I’m better equipped to testify to the veracity of that than I wish I were. Over the last decade, I’ve been through this whole “watching-someone-you-love-die” situation enough times to make my streaming gem selection double as an expert witness testimonial. I’ve seen the four people closest to me through the entire dying process – my father, my best friend, my brother and my mother, in that order. In three of those instances I witnessed the precise moment of their deaths (I missed my mom’s by minutes). And, while I can tell you that there wasn’t a great deal of hilarity in any of these scenarios, Kelly’s eager use of it in his film makes even the most wrenching moments watchable without denying a single stab of the pain that inspired them. His actors show equal skill at balancing hilarity and horror. Plemons uses his usual sphinx-like expression as a subtle tool to indicate the full range of his character’s smothered emotion. In one amazing scene, he ends up in bed with his ex-boyfriend. The result could make cinema history as one of the most sexually awkward scenes ever filmed. Yet, as written by Kelly, and as played by Plemons and Wood, the clumsy interaction has an intimacy and warmth that touches the soul. Shannon, a comedic actor who has always been able to find empathy in even the most humiliating situations, may, at times, seem too good to be true. She could be the most likable dying person ever. Yet her grace never obscures the filo-dough-thick layers of anger and loss inherent in her lot. Even a character who might have seemed shoe-horned into the script finds a sweet place in the pathos. Josie Totah, a trans actor who played male parts during this phase of her career, appears as the beyond-flamboyant brother of Plemons’ best friend. It’s just a cameo but the contours of the characters’ outrageousness speak of a confidence you won’t soon forget. Scene-stealing of that sort fits well in a film where most of the comedy isn’t generated by the lead character. Instead, Plemons plays the hapless observer, brooding or steaming while the other characters struggle with how to respond to the profound sadness of his mother’s situation. Her will to cause as little pain to others as possible makes the sight of her torturous medical treatments sting. As the film unfolds, its title takes on multiple meanings – from “these kinds of horrors happen to other people,” to the notion of otherness itself. In 1981, Martin Amis’ published a novel titled Other People: A Mystery Story. But, the truth is, if you live long enough, similar situations to those in the film will happen to every single one of you.

2/18/2022,"The second generation of Ikea’s novel Sonos-powered wifi speaker lamp looks a little sleeker than the first, sounds a bit better and comes in new shapes, materials and colour combinations. The idea is the same as for the rest of the Symfonisk range: hide a speaker in a piece of stylish furniture. In true Ikea fashion, the £179 ($169) lamp comes flat-packed, although thankfully only in three parts: the base, the plug and the shade.  The base of the lamp is an 18cm-wide fabric-covered cylinder, available in grey/white or black. This contains the speaker. The shade is available in either grey or black and in two styles: fabric, as photographed, or glass, similar to the lamp’s predecessor. The shade and base can be bought separately and mixed and matched. The top of the base has standard lamp fittings. It takes an E27 bulb (not included) and will fit other shades with a 4cm-diameter ring if you don’t like Ikea’s options. The lamp is as easy to set up as the Symfonisk Picture Frame. Download the Sonos app on your Android or iPhone, run the setup routine, tap your phone on the back of the lamp when instructed and connect it to wifi. It operates like any other Sonos speaker, streaming music over wifi – not Bluetooth – from your choice of music service. The system supports practically every major service, including Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music and BBC Sounds, plus Apple’s AirPlay 2 and Spotify Connect. The lamp can be used on its own or paired with another for stereo sound. It can also be linked with Sonos’s soundbars for surround sound, or grouped with other Ikea or Sonos speakers for easy multi-room audio. It does not have microphones for Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa, but the speaker can be controlled with all major voice assistants via another smart speaker or your phone. Base dimensions: 18 x 18 x 28cm Base weight: 2.39kg Connectivity: Wifi, ethernet, AirPlay 2, Spotify Connect Cord length: 200cm Light socket: E27 (screw) Shade ring: 4cm diameter The second-gen lamp sounds slightly better than its predecessor and similar to the Symfonisk picture frame. But it projects its audio 180 degrees around its base, making it sound less directional than other speakers. Place it against a wall in the middle of a room and it’ll sound the same regardless of where you’re sitting in front of it. Thanks to Sonos’s audio engineering the speaker is well balanced, with a rounded sound that is significantly better than many simpler Bluetooth speakers. Up to about 70% volume it has punchy bass, warm treble and nicely detailed highs. But crank up the volume further and it starts to struggle, with failing bass and over-accentuated treble. It sounds best at 50% or lower, which is more than loud enough for small or medium-sized rooms. But its wide, less directional sound struggles to project the music deeper into big rooms and can’t match the Sonos One or larger speakers. It is compatible with Sonos’s Trueplay auto-tuning system using an iPhone or iPad and has bass, treble and loudness settings to customise the sound manually, too. Ikea does not offer a repair service but replacement cords (£7) and other parts are available. It does not contain any recycled material, nor does Ikea publish individual environmental impact assessments. But it offers a recycling scheme for its products and publishes an annual sustainability report. Sonos commits to supporting feature updates through software on its own products for at least five years after it stops selling them, but has a track record of doing so for much longer, including bug and security fixes for its legacy products. The Symfonisk range will receive similar levels of support. The Ikea Symfonisk speaker lamp costs £179 ($169.99) with a fabric shade or £199 ($189.99) with a glass shade. For comparison, the Symfonisk wifi bookshelf speaker costs £99, the Symfonisk picture frame costs £199, the Sonos One SL speaker costs £149 and the Sonos One costs £199. The second-generation Symfonisk speaker lamp is still a good idea well executed: good Sonos sound hidden in a sleeker and better-looking light. With a greater number of colour and shade combinations to pick from, it is even easier to blend the lamp into your decor, as long as you like a the look of a slightly chunky, black or grey fabric-covered lamp base. Sonos’s audio system continues to shine. It’s easy to control, compatible with almost every music streaming service and regularly updated, supported and expanded so your speakers aren’t left outdated. It is a slight shame the audio quality falters at high volume, but for small- or medium-sized rooms it should be loud enough for most at under 70% maximum volume. The light part of the unit is a standard E27 fitting with a manual push-button switch on the base, but you can fit a smart bulb such as Philips Hue for dimming or remote control. If you want a speaker that is less a piece of technology and more an item of functional furniture, the second-gen Ikea Symfonisk speaker lamp is great. Pros: great sound, good-looking, with a range of colour and shade options, easy set up, Sonos control, wide support for music services, can be paired up, optional ethernet, standard E27 bulb socket. Cons: base is quite large for a table lamp, no smart speaker mics, no Bluetooth or line in, no bulb included, can’t maintain music quality above about 70% volume.

2/18/2022,"It is the unspoken promise of parenthood, the deal millions make as their fledglings fly the nest: that in an emergency, they can always come fluttering back. Even if they never have to cash that unwritten cheque, just knowing it’s there can be enough to see them through the wobbly early years of independence. That place is home. It is what gives young adults the confidence to flee a toxic relationship or a dodgy flatshare, knowing they’re not going to end up on the street, or to stick it out in the kind of insecure careers where persistence ultimately pays off. But home isn’t like that for everyone, and shamefully it’s least like that for children parented by the state. Once they turn 16 they’re no longer looked-after children, a euphemism already covering a multitude of sins, but “care leavers”. At best that means staying with a loving foster family until they’re ready to leave, but at worst it means the kind of downhill slide that explains why too many rough sleepers have previously been in care. Almost half of care leavers have mental health issues and more than a third aren’t in education, employment or training between the ages of 19 and 21. Although the state now offers a “personal adviser” to guide them into their 20s, with the best will in the world it’s not going to be like crying on a parental shoulder.  And that’s the backdrop to the Welsh government’s brave and imaginative decision this week to trial a universal basic income (UBI) of £1,600 a month – equivalent to an annual salary of just over £19,000 – to care leavers. Brave, because it invites not just predictable tabloid outrage at handing out “money for nothing” but also understandable resentment from workers slogging away at minimum-wage jobs that they don’t enjoy for the same money. But imaginative, because if it works – which will mean coupling that money with the kind of intensive support and guidance that care leavers should frankly be getting anyway – it opens up a much broader debate about the future of welfare. It’s road-testing an idea that will make instinctive sense to most parents, which is that the emotional security money buys is not nothing; indeed, for some, it might actually be everything. A now famous trial of UBI for unemployed people in Finland, originally designed to test whether the carrot of free money was more effective than the stick of sanctions in getting people back into jobs, found only a slight increase in days worked but a much bigger impact on happiness and health. Recipients reported less stress, depression, sadness and loneliness than the control group, plus more confidence in the future. More surprisingly, they also reported higher cognitive skills – things such as the ability to remember, learn and concentrate – and higher levels of trust in their fellow Finns and in public institutions. If buying happiness, focus and trust doesn’t sound like a terribly efficient use of public money then you are not thinking hard enough about how much unhappiness and all its spiralling consequences – from anxiety and depression to drug and alcohol addiction, relationship breakdown, or the lifelong emotional and educational impact on children’s lives of having parents continually pushed to the limit – costs the taxpayer. Or just how much public trust in institutions from the police to public health experts turned out to matter in a pandemic, or how easily the politics of hate feeds off misery and suspicion. What’s interesting about the Finnish findings is that they chime with research from developmental economists suggesting that giving away cold hard cash can be a surprisingly effective way of delivering aid. As the Dutch historian and UBI enthusiast Rutger Bregman has repeatedly argued, the myth that poor people will only blow it on booze and cigarettes is just that: people counting every penny tend to know exactly what they’d do with a bit more, using it strategically and frugally. If anything it’s grinding deprivation that drives humans towards bad choices, and money that helps us make better ones, lifting the fog of panic and exhaustion and helplessness that accompanies poverty and giving recipients the confidence to take risks. The catch for UBI advocates, however, is that the magic of universal basic income may well lie in the last two words, not the first. For many the whole point is the universality, or the dream that free money for everyone will miraculously engender a warm fuzzy feeling of togetherness even in those too wealthy to actually benefit (because for them UBI would be effectively taxed away) while delivering on the Keynesian dream of prosperity buying ever-expanding leisure. But that’s not where the evidence points. The secret sauce seems to be providing people who just can’t see another way out with enough free money to catch their breath and make plans. An extra pittance for everyone regardless of need – which is what every economically realistic proposal for UBI I’ve ever seen ends up apologetically boiling down to, given the exorbitant cost – is the worst of all worlds; not quite enough to be meaningful to those who could really benefit, but still too expensive to be politically plausible. Better to start by funding the existing welfare system properly, recognising that the benefit cuts of the past decade went far too deep and left millions without enough to live on, and then targeting those for whom the security of a basic income could be genuinely life-changing. In San Francisco and Vancouver, there have been small but fascinating pilots involving free cash transfers to homeless people. The success of furlough in keeping people attached to the workplace despite being temporarily out of a job suggests another possible avenue. Most people who lose their jobs aren’t out of work for long, but for those who don’t have savings, even a few months on benefits that are a fraction of their normal salary mean racking up debt that can leave long-term scars. Some kind of time-limited basic income for newly redundant people could bridge that gap, and give people a chance to retrain; it could be useful too in softening the transition to net zero, offering people who lose jobs in dying fossil-fuel industries time to rethink their futures. The possibilities are exciting, but only if we let go of the utopian theory and focus relentlessly on what actually works. It’s not about money for nothing. It’s money for things that might just turn out to be priceless.

2/18/2022,"In the wake of racial justice protests following the murder of George Floyd, a wave of Republican lawmakers supported legislation to punish protesters who blocked roads. Now some of those same Republicans are supporting similar tactics from conservative trucker convoys protesting against vaccine mandates.  Last year, the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, signed an anti-rioting law that stiffened penalties for protesters who blocked roads and even gave some legal protection to drivers who ran them over. It went so far that in September a federal judge struck down the law, ruling it unconstitutional. Draft legislation from DeSantis – seen by many as the leading heir to Donald Trump – was even more draconian. He initially sought to extend “stand-your-ground” laws that would have granted legal immunity to drivers claiming to have unintentionally killed or injured protesters disrupting traffic. Yet DeSantis has thrown his support behind conservative trucker convoys using similar tactics to protest against vaccine mandates that for weeks have blocked roads between Canada and the US, stalling trade between the two nations and leading to disruptions to the global supply chain. He also announced Florida’s attorney general would investigate GoFundMe after it dropped the page for donations to Canadian truckers. Nor is he alone. The Texas senator Ted Cruz told Politico he sent a letter to Federal Trade Commission demanding an investigation into GoFundMe. The Ohio congressman Jim Jordan similarly decried GoFundMe. Many Republican politicians have also expressed enthusiasm and support for US truckers seeking to emulate the Canadian protests on US soil. A convoy of truckers is set to begin a protest drive to Washington later this month, in a move some fear could bring the same kind of disruption that has gripped the Canadian capital, Ottawa. The Kentucky senator Rand Paul, who has criticized the disruptive tactics of racial justice protesters in the US, is “all for” the disruption of a trucker convoy. “I hope the truckers do come to America. I hope they clog up cities,” Paul told the Daily Signal, a publication of the conservative thinktank the Heritage Foundation. Paul said: “Civil disobedience is a time-honored tradition in our country, from slavery to civil rights, to you name it. Peaceful protest, clog things up, make people think about the mandates.” In 2020, Paul described a crowd of Black Lives Matter protesters that confronted him in Washington as an “angry mob”, thanking police for escorting him and “literally saving our lives from a crazed mob”. Jared Holt, a researcher of extremism, said the double standard by rightwing politicians was part of a strategy by Republicans to favor seizing any political opportunities to disrupt a Joe Biden presidency, rather than choose to be consistent in ideology . “I think the hypocrisy on display makes evident that this kind rhetoric is best understood as a piece of a broader project and not a hard ideological stance,” said Holt, resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s digital forensic lab, a non-profit that monitors and combats disinformation online. Thirteen states with Republican legislatures have introduced bills offering some level of immunity to drivers for hitting protesters blocking roads, an investigation by the Boston Globe found, with Iowa, Oklahoma and Florida successfully putting those laws on the books. Some of those lawmakers who drafted legislation have expressed support for convoys. Bill Eigel, a Missouri state senator who sponsored a bill to crack down on protesters who block roads and grant some immunity to drivers who hit them, joined other Republican state legislators this month to speak at a rally promoted as a “freedom convoy” to the capitol. The possibility of a US trucker convoy repeating the Canadian protests in America has also captured the imagination of the conservative media and many others on the right in America. Fox News has devoted 15 hours of coverage in the past few weeks, according to Media Matters. In the same span, over a hundred thousand social media accounts have participated in convoy groups, on Facebook and alt-tech platforms like Telegram, in a decentralized effort to organize a protest in the US. Organizers of the most popular trucker convoy group announced plans to meet in Barstow, California, next week and begin their journey to Washington. The Department of Homeland Security this month warned law enforcement agencies that a trucker convoy could be planning to reach Washington by the State of the Union address on 1 March. Holt said the convoys have the potential to be “fairly disrupting, especially on travel and supply chains” but cautioned against parallels to the 6 January attack on the Capitol. “From what I’ve seen so far, I don’t believe a majority of the people who have expressed interest in participating in this are doing so with the express intention of committing acts of violence,” he said. But he added: “That being said, a fair amount of them do subscribe to conspiratorial, far-right, extremist [ideologies]. So the risk is always there.”",News/US news,Republicans who opposed racial justice protests hope truckers ‘clog up’ US cities,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/18/republicans-trucker-convoys-coronavirus-covid-mandates
2/18/2022,"Pine martens are to be deployed as wildlife bouncers along the east coast of Scotland and the A9 corridor to halt the northward march of grey squirrels. More than 35 artificial pine marten dens are being installed by Forestry and Land Scotland (FLS) at strategic locations on the grey squirrels’ path of northward migration in an attempt to save the Highland red squirrel populations.  Red squirrels have been driven out of most of the British countryside since the introduction of greys in Victorian times, mainly because greys carry the squirrelpox disease, which leaves them unharmed but is fatal to the reds. But recent research has found that the return of the predatory pine marten has reduced grey squirrel populations. Because the native red squirrels and martens evolved alongside each other over thousands of years, the reds appear less affected by martens. In northern England and Scotland, there is a big community effort to control grey squirrels and help the reds survive but last year saw a dramatic expansion in the grey squirrels’ northward range, with animals moving north from Dunkeld to Pitlochry for the first time and spotted west in Aberfeldy and north of the River North Esk in the east. There is a grey squirrel population around Aberdeen, which has been restricted by culling in recent years, but the fear is that northward-scampering greys from Scotland’s central belt will meet the Aberdeen population and rapidly expand, endangering reds across north-east Scotland. “There seems to have been some movement of greys last year linked to a bumper beech mast year and possibly because trappers weren’t out because of Covid,” said Gareth Ventress, an environment forester at FLS. “We need to stop the grey squirrels in their tracks.” The dens are roofed wooden boxes fixed to trees five metres off the ground and filled with wood shavings, providing a secure and cosy nest in which martens can breed safely in spring and shelter in winter, reducing mortality rates for juveniles. If martens nest on the ground, their kits are vulnerable to predation from foxes, and while they can rear young in old buzzard nests, these are often exposed. It is hoped that the dens will increase the population density of pine martens and ensure they are living in areas where they can predate the greys. Pine martens have already returned to the region north of Perth, but dens will encourage them to frequent woods close to the A9 and the railway line north to Inverness, which provides a corridor of scrub and trees along which the greys can expand. “In many ways the A9 corridor is defendable because it’s such a narrow corridor of land, but if you travel along it you notice there is tree cover most of the way up,” said Ventress. Dens will also be installed farther east, around the A90 in Angus, after greys last year crossed the River North Esk into Aberdeenshire. Research from Ireland, Wales and Scotland shows that pine martens create “a landscape of fear” and drive away grey squirrels, with the science supported by real-world examples of resurgent pine martens alongside prospering red squirrels, which have returned to parts of Aberdeenshire where they haven’t been seen for many years. But recent studies have shown that pine martens won’t colonise urban areas, which remain a stronghold for grey squirrels. If the countryside is constantly topped up with new greys from their urban stronghold, the species is likely to rapidly adapt to survive alongside the marten. Another recent study in Ireland found that while martens increase red squirrel populations in native, broadleaf woodlands, the effect is reversed in non-native conifer plantations, where the marten reduces red squirrels. This could be due to the lack of alternative prey and the lack of hiding places for red squirrels in highly simplified landscapes. According to Ventress, the threat to reds from pine martens in conifer plantations may only apply in Ireland, where there are no field voles, the marten’s main prey in Scotland. Irish plantations also tend to be solely sitka spruce, unlike in Scotland where many plantations include native Scots pine and other trees. Ventress added: “Pine martens are not the answer to the grey squirrel threat by any stretch, but they are part of the answer. The key to this pine marten-grey squirrel relationship seems to be pine marten density. With the boxes we can potentially localise some of the pine marten population.” Ensuring grey squirrels don’t move farther north will also help foresters restore and establish native woodland in the Highlands. Grey squirrels strip bark from young trees, causing disease, damaging timber and sometimes killing trees. “Keeping the grey squirrel populations back will help us diversify, and nature and woodland restoration has a better chance,” said Ventress.",News/UK news,Pine martens to be used as ‘bouncers’ to keep grey squirrels out of Highlands,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/18/pine-martens-to-be-used-as-bouncers-to-keep-grey-squirrels-out-of-highlands

2/18/2022,"The beds pile up outside Hong Kong’s Caritas hospital. In the cold night, elderly patients lie on gurneys covered with blankets and thermal foil sheets. A woman in pink folds her arms against the chill, while another reaches across her bed in an apparent gesture of comfort to a neighbour. Nearby, others crowd into yellow and blue spillover tents lining the car park edges. The hospital staff attend people calling out when they can but they are outnumbered. Wails from patients carry through the air. There are similar scenes across the city, where 11 public hospitals were operating at or beyond capacity as of Friday. Private hospitals refuse to take Covid patients. Photos supplied to the Guardian show a treatment room inside one hospital earlier this week (88% capacity) with gurneys three deep across the thoroughfare, on a floor strewn with garbage. Bathrooms that no one has had time to clean were soiled with faeces, dirt and discarded biohazard bags.  Health workers and residents who spent two years after strict Covid controls are now asking how it all went so wrong. The city that had managed to quash outbreak after outbreak was finally being engulfed and the authorities didn’t seem to be ready. At North Lantau hospital a doctor on the emergency ward says frontline medics can no longer keep up with the mounting caseload. More than 10,000 Covid patients are waiting for hospital treatment or isolation during Hong Kong’s Omicron outbreak, with thousands more added to the backlog each day. The doctor, who asked not be named, says some patients are having to wait outdoors because wards equipped to house Covid patients are perpetually full. “The most ridiculous thing we’ve seen so far is … a 90-year-old woman lying outside for three days and still she could not be admitted.” He says medics are spread too thin to keep a close eye on patients. “If someone’s condition urgently deteriorates, we may not catch it. It is sheer luck that it has not happened yet,” he says. Hong Kong has been smashed by a wave of Omicron. It has recorded more than 16,600 cases so far this year, surpassing the total of 2020 and 2021 combined. At the moment there are about 5,000 people in hospital or isolation, though fewer than 20 are critical and about 60 in a serious condition. But hospital beds were already at 90% capacity because of a policy which saw every positive case hospitalised regardless of symptoms. Close contacts were isolated offsite in government facilities which quickly began to strain. Labs buckled under a requirement for a second test to confirm every “preliminary positive”, with reported delays of up to five days. “No system is designed to be able to cope with this level of cases,” says government adviser and University of Hong Kong’s dean of medicine, Prof Gabriel Leung. But it’s going to get worse. “We are nowhere near the peak.” Hong Kong social media is littered with mirthless and sarcastic responses of “if only they’d had two years to prepare”. For most of 2020 and 2021 Hong Kong had one of the world’s most effective responses to the pandemic. It kept total case numbers below 15,000 by quickly crushing outbreaks under a strategy of pursuing zero cases. The stakes were high. Being Covid free is Beijing’s requirement for opening its borders to the city, something Hong Kong has prioritised over opening to the rest of the world. Under the “dynamic zero” strategy Hongkongers enjoyed long stretches of time largely unencumbered. Between those stretches, when four waves of Covid hit the city, the government introduced restrictions which were often complicated and harsh, sometimes illogical, and changed frequently. But they worked – until Omicron arrived and the system crumbled. On Thursday more than 6,100 cases were officially recorded. Dr Sarah Ho of the Hospital Authority described a “crisis situation”. Online, Hong Kong clinical virologist Dr Siddharth Sridhar said the hospitals were “sandcastles in a tsunami”. “I’ve worked in healthcare in Hong Kong for a decade. Our public hospitals are always stressed. We buckle every time there’s a flu surge.” The Hospital Authority did not respond to the Guardian’s inquiries. For health experts, the major current concern is elderly people. Hong Kong had early and plentiful access to vaccines, which have been shown to significantly reduce severe infection. But for a range of reasons the immunisation rates in older age groups are alarmingly low. In aged care homes it is about 20%, says Leung. The government had plenty of warning. “The big surprise with Omicron is how predictable it really is,” says Leung. He says daily case numbers may go higher than previous predictions of 30,000, but they need to “flatten the curve”. Leung says the answer is to reduce mobility and mixing among the population to slow down the spread enough to maintain the integrity of the health system. Rumours of a “mainland style” city-wide lockdown – which were also heavily utilised in other countries including Australia and New Zealand – were ruled out by the city’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, on Tuesday, but few people seem to think it’s a concrete promise given how often things have changed. Lockdowns and social restrictions have had a huge impact on lives and businesses. Jason Lowe, president of the Craft Beer Association of Hong Kong, says their revenue has dropped by more than half. “For businesses, we already feel like we’re in a dark tunnel with no light at the end,” he says. “Instead of helping us get out, the government’s ever stricter restrictions and lack of support is more like pushing us further inside and trapping us there.” Prof Ben Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong, says mild Covid cases should be allowed to stay home. “At the moment the pressure is from not being able to admit and discharge mild cases quickly enough,” Cowling says. “But in a couple of weeks I fear the pressure is going to come from having too many patients with severe Covid and not with the resources to manage them.” The spread has slowed a little. Cases in Hong Kong are doubling every three days compared to every 1.5 to 2 in other countries, but it’s not slow enough. In the meantime the government is still committed to elimination. On Tuesday Lam declared that “surrendering to the virus” was not an option. On Wednesday’s front pages of local pro-Beijing papers Xi Jinping called on her to grasp the “overriding mission” of controlling the outbreak. Having bet the house on prevention, Hong Kong’s authorities are now faced with a potentially insurmountable task. “I’m not sure there was a failure to prepare for this type of scenario as there was a failure to anticipate the potential for this type of scenario,” says Cowling.

2/18/2022,"When I first watched The Tinder Swindler last month, in anticipation for an interview with director Felicity Morris, I was, like many viewers, completely absorbed by the story. Several women meet a man on Tinder who claims to be the billionaire heir to an Israeli diamond fortune, lavishes them with attention, flies to them on actual private jets, then swindles them for hundreds of thousands of dollars? I’m a single woman in my late 20s in New York: of course I ate it up. The documentary was also much, much better than it could have been; I appreciated that Morris didn’t have much interest in probing the psychology of its swindler, Simon Leviev. Instead, she foregrounded three women’s first-person accounts of getting conned – why they believed him, why they cared for him, what such manipulation and confusion does to someone – as well as the journalists at the Norwegian paper VG who unspooled his lies for an initial exposé in 2019.  Still, I figured that The Tinder Swindler would be a hit – it’s true crime meets scam meets Catch Me If You Can meets the perils of modern dating – and that made me nervous. I have come to associate “Netflix hit”, at least in the reality and documentary department, with a feeling of ominousness, portentous of something queasy, cringey, sad, or sinister. The scale of Netflix’s reach is such that almost anything that succeeds on the streaming platform invites exploitation; Netflix fame opens subjects who might not be prepared for international recognition up to intense levels of scrutiny and at this point in the life of the internet, there’s always a dark, seedy undercurrent to attention. Popularity attracts backlash, desperation and grifters. Netflix fame has traditionally not aged well – think of 2020’s standout Tiger King, which spawned a virtual cottage industry of hustling for its dubious participants. Or another Netflix hit, the docuseries Cheer, whose participants – junior college cheerleaders in the small town of Corsicana, Texas – became overnight stars. I wrote in February 2020, at the peak of Cheer’s popularity, about the unsettling experience of watching its stars’ “character” arcs wrap on screen as their fame expanded, warped and monetized in real time off it. I loved the show’s first season, but the buzz around it, its brief ubiquity felt unstable, fragile. Then its breakout star, Jerry Harris, was charged with soliciting sex from minors and alleged to have abused his influence with younger athletes for sex. (I have not seen Cheer’s second season, which premiered earlier this year and addresses the fallout of fame and Harris’s arrest, in part because of this wariness.) It was practically a given that someone would adapt The Tinder Swindler into a dramatic film. (Netflix is in early talks of doing so, though no formal plans have been announced.) It is also a given, if you have seen the documentary, that Simon Leviev would attempt to spin his new notoriety into some sort of financial gain. But I’m still impressed by the speed at which this attention curdled. Earlier this week, Leviev signed with Hollywood talent manager Gina Rodriguez, a self-described “D-list diva” who has turned the scandals of a truly impressive roster of unscrupulous figures into deals, further exposure, and cash. (An incomplete selection of her client list: Lindsay Lohan’s parents, Nadya Suleman, AKA “Octomom”, Tareq and Michaele Salahi, AKA the White House gatecrashers, “Teen Mom” Farrah Abraham, and several Real Housewives.) Leviev also launched an account on Cameo, a platform through which people can buy personalized shoutouts from celebrities, charging $200 for personal use and $1,400 for businesses. “I’m Simon Leviev – if you want any blessing, anything birthday, whatever, shout out … I’m so excited to be here,” he says in his intro video; there’s a button to join his fan club “to unlock even more content”. I don’t want to blow this out of proportion – just because Leviev signed with a talent manager and has expressed an interest in having a dating show doesn’t mean he’ll actually get a content deal. He’s already been banned from dating apps such as Tinder and Hinge. Upon the release of the film earlier this month, he posted an Instagram story to his account (heavily featured in the film and since deactivated, though it can be hard to know – there are now countless impersonations of @simon_leviev_official) that he would soon tell his version of events, but so far that’s nothing more than bluster. (Morris and her team were in contact with Leviev during filming – his voice notes are included – but he declined to sit for an interview.) His Cameo account has, as of this writing, just five reviews and 51 fans. It is possible that Leviev will fade into obscurity with the tide of viral content. But it’s unlikely – grifters will grift, attention begets attention, and there’s so many ways to parlay 15 minutes of fame into a life of hustling content for deals, cash and fans. It is a bleak comment on which avenues attention greases that while Leviev has signed with a veteran manager and is hustling his fame for money, the three women featured in the film – Cecilie Fjellhøy, Pernilla Sjoholm and Ayleen Charlotte – have started a GoFundMe to help pay off their debts from Leviev’s cons and offer a legit alternative to several fake fundraisers. “We don’t want more people getting defrauded,” the three wrote in their info section. “All we want are our lives back.” As of this writing, the page has raised about $193,000 of their roughly $800,000 goal. Since the documentary, a study emerged that found Americans lost more than $1bn in 2021 alone to “romance scams”. This is not to blame the film-makers for spawning Leviev’s demi-celebrity. Leviev was still at large when Morris began the project, and the three victims – first Fjellhøy and Sjoholm, then Charlotte – were justifiably trying to spread the word as far as possible to protect other women. The film is much more about the experience of being conned, both emotionally and financially, than about Leviev; lots of true crime series get hung up on the question of why someone hurts someone else, but The Tinder Swindler thankfully just accepts Leviev as a pathological narcissist and liar, no explanation needed. It’s just that the swift churn of attention to profit, regardless of what said subject has done and who has paid for it, is fatiguing. None of this is surprising, but that doesn’t mean it’s not worth noting. With Netflix true crime hits, if you’re enjoying it, if you’re interested, then there’s likely a cost – if not the dark toll of fame, then someone unsavory profiting from it.",Arts/Television & radio,The Tinder Swindler fallout shows the dark side of Netflix fame | Adrian Horton,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/18/the-tinder-swindler-simon-leviev-neflix-fame
2/18/2022,"Hello, it’s time for Friday’s Guardian morning briefing with me, Warren Murray.  Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, has agreed to meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, next week provided there is no invasion of Ukraine in the meantime. A fresh flurry of meetings between western leaders begins today with the US president, Joe Biden, hosting a call with the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, Britain, the European Union and Nato. The US vice-president, Kamala Harris, is due to arrive in Munich for weekend talks with leaders including the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Biden has said he believes Russia is on the brink of invading and his administration had “reason to believe” the Kremlin was “engaged in a false-flag operation to have an excuse to go in”. Blinken has told a UN security council meeting that “Russia plans to manufacture a pretext for its attack. This could be a violent event that Russia will blame on Ukraine, or an outrageous accusation that Russia will level against the Ukrainian government.” Claims of attacks by Russian-backed separatists at several locations in Ukraine’s Donbas region, including at a kindergarten and a school, were said to bear the hallmarks of an attempt to incite conflict. Russia continues to deny that it has any intention of invading Ukraine but Blinken told the security council: “Our information indicates clearly that [Russian] forces, including ground troops, aircraft, ships, are preparing to launch an attack against Ukraine in the coming days.” We will have updates all day at our Ukraine crisis live blog. Batten down for Storm Eunice – The east of England, including London, has been added this morning to the red weather warning for wind issued by the Met Office because of Storm Eunice, whose arrival has prompted rare danger-to-life warnings, with people told to stay indoors at home to avoid its 90mph winds. It joins the warning starting from 7am along the coastline of Devon, Cornwall and Somerset, as well as the south coast of Wales, due to the combination of high tides, strong winds and storm surges. People have been warned to stay home if possible, tie down objects in their gardens and be wary of fierce winds that could cause trees to topple over and tiles to fly off buildings. A Network Rail spokesman said disruption is “inevitable” and Welsh services will be suspended for the whole day. Airports including Gatwick and Stansted are advising customers to check with their airlines. National Highways announced a severe weather alert for strong winds covering the whole strategic road network. The M48 Severn Bridge, the alternative Prince of Wales bridge, A14 Orwell Bridge in Suffolk and QEII Bridge in Dartford are all closing this morning. Yellow weather warnings for wind and snow are in force for a large part of Scotland, where blizzards are predicted, and the whole of Northern Ireland. Strong winds from Storm Dudley have already caused significant disruption to rail and ferry services, with trees blown on to train tracks and overhead power lines. Call to rein in APPGs – More than £13m has been poured into MPs’ interest groups by private firms including healthcare bodies, arms companies and tech giants, analysis by the Guardian and openDemocracy has found. There are now 755 all-party parliamentary groups (APPGs) – a number that has ballooned from 560 five years ago. They are chaired by MPs but often run or funded by lobbyists and corporate donors seeking to influence government policy. The chair of the Commons standards committee, Chris Bryant, has called in the Guardian for parliamentary authorities to be able to shut down the largely self-policed groups where there are clear conflicts of interest. His standards committee has opened an inquiry into the system. Mural makers in court – A collective of street artists known as Subset are about to enter a court battle as part of a 10-year “game of cat and mouse” with Dublin city council over three murals, including one celebrating the life of Sir David Attenborough. Under Irish law, organisers of public murals need planning permission. Subset argues Dublin is behind the times and should embrace street culture like others cities of the world. It says all its murals are painted with permission and consultation of the buildings’ occupants or owners. Subset’s works are well known in Dublin with impactful takes on contemporary issues including Covid, LGBTQ+ rights and the abortion referendum in 2018. Trumps on witness stand – Donald Trump, Donald Jr and Ivanka have been ordered by a New York judge to appear for a deposition within the next three weeks as part of the investigation over alleged fraud in the valuation of assets belonging to the family business. Under the judge’s ruling, Trump must testify within 21 days and hand over “documents and information” within 14 days. On Monday it was revealed that the longtime accounting firm for the Trump Organization, Mazars USA, had broken off ties with the family business, saying it could no longer stand by 10 years of annual financial statements that it had prepared for the group. Stamp man gets own issue – A set of stamps is being launched to pay tribute to David Gentleman, the designer credited with changing the face of the British stamp. Gentleman designed more than 100 stamps for Royal Mail between 1962 and 2000, and provided many more designs that were not used. Among his innovations, Gentleman introduced a small cameo of the Queen, based on her profile as depicted by Mary Gillick on coins from 1953. Gentleman said: “Stamps were fun to design, though squeezing a lot into a small space wasn’t easy. At first it was difficult to fit in the Queen’s head until I turned it into the simple profile which is still used today. Stamps I particularly enjoyed designing were for the Battle of Hastings 1066, and Social Reformers.” The Net Zero Scrutiny Group insists it accepts the facts of the climate emergency. But as the cost of living crisis deepens, they see an opportunity to push back against their own Conservative government’s climate agenda, as Helena Horton reports.

The pair had entered the UK years earlier after investing at least £2m under the “golden visa” scheme, which attracted thousands of wealthy people from Russia and former Soviet states to settle in Britain if they brought some of their millions with them. The scheme remained open for years, and even after parliament’s joint intelligence and security committee said it was “welcoming oligarchs with open arms”. The Home Office finally ended it on Thursday with immediate effect. Rangers have dismantled a stunned Borussia Dortmund 4-2, leaving their hosts and earlier Europa League favourites staring elimination square in the face. Novak Djokovic could be allowed to enter this year’s Italian Open despite the men’s world No 1 being unvaccinated, according to officials in Italy. The undersecretary for sports, Valentina Vezzali, said tennis is “an outdoor sport and the tighter green pass is not required”. The FIA has dismissed Michael Masi as Formula One’s race director after his role in the controversial finale to last season’s championship-deciding Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. At the Winter Olympics, Team GB are guaranteed a medal at last, in the men’s curling – keep up with the action at our live blog. US stock futures have bounced and selling pressure eased in Asian share markets today. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia shares outside Japan was last down 0.5%, but markets in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Sydney and Seoul all pared deeper morning losses. At time of writing, the FTSE looks like opening a quarter of a percent higher, while the pound is on $1.361 and €1.197. The Guardian’s front-page lead today is “Russia ready to fake cause for Ukraine attack – Biden”. Britain’s curling men are shown at work as the team prepares to bring home Team GB’s first medal of these Winter Olympics. “Is this what Putin means about pulling out troops?” asks the Metro, showing Russian rockets being fired in border drills. Its splash though is “Red alert!”, about the arrival of Storm Eunice. “UK braced for the 100mph sting jet storm” says the i, and other papers use this same bit of weather jargon that we all just learned – in fact the Daily Mail’s headline is more or less the same. The Sun dials it up to “100mph killer storm” and the Daily Express calls it the “Storm of the century”. The Telegraph has “Russia begins ‘false flag attacks’” and the Times says “Whitehall convinced Putin is about to invade”. Joe Biden’s line that the Financial Times uses is becoming repetitive: “Russia poised to invade Ukraine within days, Biden warns allies”. The Mirror’s splash is about the social care crisis – its headline: “Inhumane: thousands of elderly residents kicked out in tsunami of private care home closures”.

2/18/2022,"Somalia’s displacement camps are coming under intense pressure with more than 300,000 people leaving their homes in search of food and water so far this year as the country experiences its worst drought in decades. People have been walking miles to camps, already home to those escaping the country’s protracted violence, after three consecutive failed rainy seasons since October 2020 that have decimated crops and livestock. Somalia has more than 2,400 such settlements, which already lack resources.  The UN has warned that Somalia is “staring at a potential catastrophe” this year. “This camp is overcrowded, with no access to food, water and healthcare. We have not had water for one week. The truck that used to bring us water did not come,” said Mohamud Mohamed, who travelled 80 miles to a displacement camp in Luuq, in southern Gedo province, after most of his village’s livestock died of thirst. “People eat one meal a day or two, if they are lucky, and making tea counts as a meal here. The situation is extremely difficult.” According to the UN, more than a quarter of Somalia’s population urgently needs food aid. About 1.4 million children under five are likely to be acutely malnourished. Conditions are expected to get worse, with no rains due until April. The famine early warning systems network has warned April’s rains will probably be below average, which humanitarians say would increase the likelihood of a famine. Islamic Relief said that during a visit to the Bardhere camp in Gedo, its staff found people living in basic shelters with little food and water, with many on “the brink of death”. The charity said there had been several deaths, including that of a baby, during their visit. At the Luuq camp, the Irish Catholic NGO Trócaire said it had found starving children. On Wednesday, Care International’s Somalia country director Iman Abullahi said schools at displacement camps were overcrowded because of the new arrivals. Figures from the UN refugee agency suggest most of the 317,000 people displaced since January left their homes because of drought. Almost a fifth of Somalia’s population is now internally displaced. “The camps are the only place they know there is help, so if all of your food is gone and livestock is dead you go there,” said Aliow Mohamed, disaster response manager at Islamic Relief. “This means growing pressure on existing IDP [internally displaced people] camps. Many are living in shelters just made of plastic sheeting and poles. These camps have nothing. As they grow more crowded, there are more issues with hygiene, water supply and protection.” He said farmers had already been hit hard by the locust swarms in early 2020 that wiped out crops. Save the Children said that at least 700,000 livestock had died in two months last year. The UN reported some areas have lost 80% of their livestock. Mohamed, at the Luuq camp, said his family lost 80 goats and 12 cows in three months last year. “Everyone left the village,” he said. “If we stayed any longer, my children and elderly parents would be the next to die of hunger.” At the beginning of the month, 43 died and more than 14,000 were displaced when fighting over land for pasture and water erupted between two clans. Those displaced are now living in makeshift shelters. A $1.46bn (£1.07bn) humanitarian appeal for Somalia launched in December has only received 2% of the money needed. Etienne Peterschmitt, the Somalia representative for the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, said the humanitarian response to the crisis had been more effective than in the past, but needed scaling up to ease the rising pressure on displacement camps. “A concerted humanitarian scale-up by the international community is needed urgently to prevent even worse outcomes in the coming months,” said Peterschmitt. “Bringing assistance to rural areas, as close as possible to affected communities, will prevent massive displacement, related aggravating risks and excess mortality.” Abdullahi Osman, a member of the national emergency committee, the Somali government body overseeing the response to the crisis, said the country was calling for international support. “We have been mobilising local resources from the business community to reach those most vulnerable. “The committee sent money to 19 cities so far but that is not enough. In addition to the resource shortages we are also hampered by accessibility due to insecurity as well as lack of coordination and absences of public authority in some of the regions affected by the drought.” According to the World Food Programme, the Horn of Africa is experiencing its driest conditions since 1981, with 13 million people across Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia facing severe hunger.",News/Global development,Somalis in crowded camps on ‘brink of death’ as drought worsens,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/18/somalia-crowded-camps-drought-worsens
