1/4/2022,"Covid-19 cases in Florida have risen by 948% in just two weeks, as the highly transmissible Omicron variant drives a huge wave of infections and hospitalizations across the entire US.  Even as Dr Anthony Fauci – Joe Biden’s top medical adviser – cautioned the public to look at hospitalisations and not infections in order to gauge Omicron’s severity, the seven-day average for US patients hospitalised with Covid-19 increased by more than 40% during the week between Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Cases have risen by a whopping 101% nationally, despite tests being in short supply in many areas. Daily deaths are up 37%, according to the Washington Post. In Florida, local and state officials warned that residents were waiting hours in sometimes miles-long lines just to get a test. Some accused the state health department and the governor, Ron DeSantis, of being missing in action. “It’s every man/woman for themselves, because leadership is MIA,” tweeted state senator Shevrin Jones. Evidence suggests Omicron is a more mild if highly infectious variant. But it “will still do terrible damage among the unvaccinated in both the US and worldwide”, according to the New York Times. Only 62% of the US population is fully vaccinated, with numbers especially low in the south and many of the mountain states. Boosters are available for people 16 and older, but only about a third of fully vaccinated Americans have opted to get one – despite Fauci saying the extra dose represents “optimal” protection from Omicron. The Food and Drug Administration decided on Monday that 12- to 15-year-olds should also be eligible for a booster, although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still needs to give the green light. Some immunocompromised Americans are going back for fourth or fifth shots, though it is unclear whether doing so is safe or effective, the New York Times reported. Dorry Segev, a transplant surgeon at Johns Hopkins University, told the paper that hundreds enrolled in a study he is working on have received unauthorized doses. “They’re acting out of desperation,” he said. “Rather than say, ‘Shame on them,’ I would say, ‘Shame on the system we’ve created.’” Covid-19 has killed more than 820,000 people across the US. It has upended lives and livelihoods, disrupted education, left Americans feeling isolated, and at times sent the economy into free-fall. Mass holiday travel was a predictable recipe for yet another surge, similar to last winter. But nearly two years into the pandemic, the US was still woefully ill-equipped for such conditions and the Omicron variant, sending Americans scrambling to even find tests. Over the holiday season, thousands of flights were canceled because of Omicron-caused staffing shortages. Last week, the US smashed its record for Covid-19 infections reported in one day. Major companies are having to reconsider plans for employees to finally return to offices. Yet some experts and analysts still hope that Omicron will ultimately represent a move toward normalcy, where Covid-19 becomes a long-term reality but causes less devastation. “I think it’s likely that we’ll see this wave come and go and that the spring and summer will look a lot better than right now looks to us,” Ofer Levy, director of the Precision Vaccines Program at Boston Children’s hospital, told CNN. “There will be fewer cases, and then again, next fall and winter we’ll see a spike of viral illnesses, coronaviruses, influenza and others, but that it’ll be more like an endemic cycle.”",News/US news,Covid cases rise by 948% in Florida as Omicron drives huge wave across US,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/03/us-covid-omicron-coronavirus-cases-florida
1/4/2022,"Thiago Silva has eased Chelsea’s defensive concerns after signing a one-year contract extension. Thomas Tuchel is facing the prospect of having to reshape his defence in the summer, with César Azpilicueta, Andreas Christensen and Antonio Rüdiger out of contract. Chelsea are yet to agree extensions with the trio but there has never been any prospect of Silva leaving on a free. Tuchel values Silva’s leadership and will be happy to have the 37-year-old for another season. The Brazil centre-back, who has impressed since joining on a free from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2020, helped Chelsea win the Champions League last season and hopes to go to the World Cup this year.  “To play here with Chelsea is a real pleasure,” Silva told the club’s website. “I never thought I would play for three years here in this great club so I’m very happy to stay for another season. I will continue to give everything for this club and for the supporters, who have always been by my side since I arrived. “It’s amazing to have this relationship with the fans and not only that but the players, staff and the whole club. I’m going to give everything to keep playing at this level in the most important league in the world.” Chelsea are aware that Azpilicueta, Christensen and Rüdiger can negotiate pre-contract agreements with foreign clubs now. Real Madrid are leading the race to sign Rüdiger, who is not satisfied with Chelsea’s offer of £140,000 a week. The Germany centre-back is also of interest to Bayern Munich, Juventus and PSG. Tuchel recently revealed frustration at the uncertainty over Christensen, who has twice changed his mind after agreeing new deals. Barcelona are interested in Azpilicueta but it is understood that the captain will stay if given a suitable offer. Chelsea have mounting injury problems before the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final against Tottenham on Wednesday.

1/4/2022,"In its response to the staffing crisis in schools (Combine classes in case of Covid staff shortages, DfE tells teachers in England, 2 January), there’s one resource that the government has yet to tap into – the inspectorate. If Ofsted is not going to inspect “secondary schools or colleges in the first week of term”, why not deploy the inspectors to teach in them, and why not for as long as the health crisis affects staffing levels? Instead of telling teachers that their provision is “inadequate” or “requiring improvement”, the inspectors could lead by example and show staff how “outstanding” teaching can be done. There are clearly not enough inspectors to fill all the vacancies that will be caused by the pandemic, but Ofsted has around 1,800 employees across eight regions, most of whom could be redeployed to where the need is greatest, in those schools and colleges serving the most deprived communities. This policy would cost nothing, it would be hugely beneficial to those institutions and pupils in improving the quality of their education, and it would also act as a useful means of updating inspectors about the challenges of working in them.  Politicians are forever claiming that they don’t have a magic wand to solve complex problems, but this measure is the closest they are likely to get to a partial solution that could be enacted immediately. What’s not to like?Frank CoffieldEmeritus professor of education, UCL Institute of Education  Nadhim Zahawi has told schools to “utilise all your available teaching and non-teaching workforce to maximise on-site education for as many pupils as possible”. It would seem that schools are being seen by the Department for Education as simply holding places to keep children off the streets and away from homes so that their parents can go to work. Few state schools have classrooms large enough to “merge classes”, but since five of the current six ministers in the DfE went to independent schools, they may not realise this. “For a classroom to qualify for a government air purifier, the DfE says it must show a ‘sustained’ CO2 reading of 1,500 particles per million or higher for a week when occupied,” your report says. So, while teaching a merged class, a non-teacher needs to count air particles. Help!Michael BasseyEmeritus professor of education, Nottingham Trent University  If Robert Halfon is really concerned about children’s “wellbeing, mental health and anxiety”, he will get behind evidenced-based measures, such as mask-wearing, to help keep them in schools. Disruption caused by illness, school closures and a succession of unfamiliar teachers is bound to be extremely damaging to young people. To date there has been no serious government effort in the UK to improve ventilation in schools. However, the evidence is incontrovertible: masks help to cut transmission. Many students will be relieved to be in classrooms where others are wearing masks, especially those in clinically vulnerable families who carry the burden of knowing they could bring home a virus that could kill. None of this is ideal; pandemics aren’t. As adults we have to stop undermining measures that will help protect students and staff and keep schools open.Caroline O’DwyerLondon  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

1/4/2022,"I am a landowner with 9,000 acres. I am probably in the minority of landowners because I encourage walkers on my land. There are, however, additional barriers to access aside from the “prejudice, traffic, locked gates, signs with the dread words ‘private – keep out’” mentioned by John Harris (Walking is a glorious, primal pastime – and far more radical than you think, 26 December). There is the planning department of our national parks to consider. I was recently encouraged to apply for a grant to create additional footpaths on my land. Indications were that some grant would be forthcoming, and I was told that the next step would be to apply for planning permission, which I did. Several months later I got a reply from the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs national park indicating that permission was highly unlikely to be granted. I was staggered by this. The right hand clearly does not know what the left hand is doing.  The desire to improve access to my land is entirely altruistic. I do not charge for entry on to the land, my business is not dependent on access to the hill, and I have no tea shop or other commercial outlet dependent on passing traffic. I genuinely believe that more people should get out and walk for the benefit of their health and life. If your newspaper would like to support a campaign to change the planning policy guidelines in this regard I would be delighted.Pelham OliveLondon  One wintry day in the 1970s, I took my two small children out, intending to walk in the grounds of a nearby stately home. But the tall gates were locked, with a “private – keep out” sign. We climbed over them and started our walk. As we came in sight of the house, a window opened and a voice said: “I say, do you know this is private property?” “Oh, yes,” I replied, “we saw your notice when we climbed over the gates.” “Well, don’t come too near the house,” the voice said, closing the window.

1/4/2022,"Jonathan Freedland is right to say we fight shy of the “why” question when faced with extreme acts of cruelty or abuse (The Ghislaine Maxwell case raises a question some may think naive: why? 31 December). But he pulls up short. We do know a lot about the explanations. There is a small group of clinicians who work with such people in prisons and special hospitals, and their findings can be simply summarised. Every one of them has their own history of childhood emotional brutality at the hands of parents or carers. What they take into themselves is this relationship. Some re-enact this in later life, expelling their experiences on to others. Others keep it internalised, then inflict injury and cruelty on themselves. Fortunately, many will have ameliorative experiences that protect others and themselves from the worst consequences. True, not everyone has a “Maxwell-style father”, but delve into the backstory of any cruelly troubled individual and you discover an intergenerational history. No one is born inherently evil, or good. It’s about innate dispositions and their nurturing over time. Between the initial conditions and the later destructive behaviours there will be twists and turns of complex causality.

1/4/2022,"The Sydney Football Stadium in Moore Park serves a decent reminder Australia is a country that rarely stands still. Originally built in 1988, what appeared to be a serviceable venue has been bulldozed since the last Ashes tour four years ago and in its place an eye-catching new AU$828m replacement is approaching completion. Barely a stone’s throw from the latest sporting UFO to land on Australian soil sits the wonderful Sydney Cricket Ground, which despite being upgraded and swollen by way of capacity over the years still retains a sense of history. Its green-roofed 19th century ladies’ and members’ pavilions are untouched through their heritage listing. So, too, the old clock tower and an array of statues that denote past greats of the game. It remains a truly evocative place to watch Test cricket.  Inspiration has been in short supply for England’s cricketers since they arrived for this pandemic-era Ashes tour in November and their issues have been myriad en route to 68 all out and 3-0 down with two Tests to play. But as they step out onto the cambered baize outfield, Joe Root hopes his men take in the surroundings, think of the charity angle to proceedings, remember past English success stories and realise how fortunate they all are to be representing their country during admittedly tough times. “It’s obviously a special Test match,” said Root, before training on Monday. “You’ve got the McGrath Foundation [raising funds for breast cancer support] and you look at some of the performances on previous tours, like the 2010-11 team winning here, how special that was and how it will live long in the memory of fans and players. “It was here [Darren] Gough got his hat-trick in 1999, too. It’s a venue where a number of special things have happened for England players and it’s an opportunity to do just that. For me personally, I’d love more than anything to walk away with a win. Personal achievements make you proud and it means you are pulling your weight. But nothing compares to winning a Test match and I’m desperate to do that.” If there is a positive to be found beyond the red lines on various lateral flow tests during a disrupted buildup, it’s that the tourists appear to have just about held together off the field while disintegrating on it. There has been grumbling about the Covid lifestyle and Stuart Broad has gone public with his annoyance at missing out on green surfaces in Brisbane and Melbourne. But any serious angst is yet to bleed out of the dressing room while Australia have been tearing them up with barely a sledge to be heard. Perhaps this should be a concern; a sign that a team which has been forced to plough through 21 Test matches since the start of the pandemic, compared to seven for their hosts, has now entered a dazed fug of mere fixture fulfilment. Australia are on a heady roll, their series win one of contributions throughout the team, and will be hard to stop now. Either way, performances in this fourth Test, followed by a fifth still slated for Hobart, may provide an answer as to the state of various minds among Root’s troupe. They may also serve to inform how much substance there is to all the private and public support for Root’s continuation as captain as he passes Alastair Cook’s record of 59 Tests in charge. The 31-year-old once again insisted it was a topic to be discussed at the end of the tour, but stressed his pride at being given the opportunity to lead “has not wavered from day one”, adding: “I’ll keep throwing everything I can into trying to give England the best chances of winning and give the best account of ourselves.” In the past week this has involved Root literally throwing everything he can at teammates in the nets due to the Covid-enforced absences of the head coach, Chris Silverwood, and three members of his staff. England’s opponents, though forced to bring in Usman Khawaja at No 5 after Travis Head tested positive for the virus, have had far fewer issues with which to contend, even if they have been ticked off for not drinking the official beer sponsor of Cricket Australia during the celebrations in Melbourne. Two days out from the toss neither side was giving much away selection-wise, other than the peripheral roles of Rory Burns and Ollie Pope at training pointing to more 12th man-duties and an unchanged England top seven. Unlike Haseeb Hameed, the opener sporting a new-look haircut in the nets as he readied himself for the latest encounter with Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc, the pitch was yet to receive a proper trim, and so the final spots among the two bowling attacks were still to be named. Gone are the days of Sydney being the ground where spinners lick their lips, however, with Nathan Lyon, one of a number on the books of New South Wales, averaging 40 with the ball here in Test cricket. As such, and with some rain forecast over the coming days, recent talk of the Queensland leg-spinner Mitch Swepson coming in to join him as a pairing in preparation for the upcoming tour of Pakistan seems optimistic. Instead, beyond a return for the experienced Khawaja, and with little reason to press Josh Hazlewood into service too soon after the side strain picked up during the first Test, Australia’s final decision appeared between whether to retain Scott Boland after his remarkable six for seven in Melbourne or return to the established pecking order by recalling the fit-again Jhye Richardson. With the latter’s last outing in Adelaide delivering a maiden five-wicket haul, it’s a good dilemma to have. England, meanwhile, were pondering a return for Broad in place of Ollie Robinson, who for all his obvious skill has looked heavy-legged at times. But ultimately the question will be whether their batting lineup can finally stand up to an attack that has been relentless from ball one of this uncompetitive series or find itself once again unsentimentally razed to the ground like the old football stadium next door.",Sport/Sport,England head to ‘special’ SCG Test in search of Ashes inspiration,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/03/england-head-to-special-scg-test-in-search-of-ashes-inspiration
1/4/2022,"A proposal to insert a statue of the first woman in the world to earn a PhD among the 78 dedicated to notable male figures on a prominent square in northern Italy has stirred controversy. Elena Lucrezia Cornaro Piscopia received her doctorate degree in philosophy from the University of Padua in 1678. But she was not included when Padua officials devised a project in the late 18th century to erect statues in Prato della Valle – the largest square in Italy – dedicated to illustrious historical figures who were either from the city or had links to it.  Originally there were 88 statues adorning the 90m2 elliptical square, all paying tribute to men, including the Italian scientist Galileo Galilei, the sculptor Antonio Canova, and several popes. But 10 statues dedicated to Venetian doges were destroyed by Napoleon’s army after it conquered the republic of Venice; eight were later replaced by obelisks, while two of the pedestals remained empty. Although a statue honouring Piscopia already exists at the University of Padua, two local councillors, Simone Pillitteri and Margherita Colonnello, proposed celebrating her with another on one of the empty pedestals at Prato della Valle. “Perhaps it is not so well known that the figures to whom the stone effigies are dedicated are all, without exception, men,” the pair wrote in a motion presented to the city’s council. The suggestion came after Mi Riconosci, an association of professionals working in the cultural heritage sector, undertook a census of all statues of Italian figures erected in public spaces across the country and found that only 148 were dedicated to women. Federica Arcoraci, an art historian with Mi Riconosci, said Prato della Valle’s male-only line-up had “an impact on our lives and collective imagination”. She said: “The Prato della Value regulation of 1776 forbade having statues of saints, living people and people with no ties to the city, but never prohibited the representation of women. “Obviously, that was the result of a particular trend in history. But today it is possible to create a project that is connected with the history of the square in its entirety.” Nevertheless, the proposal immediately sparked debate, with detractors arguing that placing a statue of Piscopia in the square would be “out of context” with its history. Carlo Fumian, a history professor at the University of Padua, said the “expensive and bizarre” idea was “a bit trendy, but culturally inconsistent”. “Moving monuments as if they were Lego is a dangerous and unintelligent game,” he told the local newspaper, Il Mattino di Padova. “Instead, we should help people discover the original [statue], triumphantly seated at the university.” Art historian Davide Tramarin said the two empty pedestals should remain empty as they represented a symbol of the historical destruction by Napoleon’s troops. Fabrizio Magani, the superintendent of Padua’s cultural heritage, is open to the idea, but suggested a female figure from more recent history ought to be celebrated in the square. “It’s shocking that even just the proposal to have a statue representing an important figure of the city has caused such a debate,” said Leonardo Bison, a Padua-based journalist. “But it’s surprising that Piscopia is not there when other less important male figures are.”",News/World news,Italy: proposal for statue of first woman to get PhD sparks debate,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/italy-proposal-statue-elena-cornaro-piscopia-first-woman-phd-debate
1/4/2022,"Giovanni Trapattoni carried a battle of holy water with him, blessed by the sister who actually was his sister. In 2009, Espanyol manager Mauricio Pochettino hiked to Montserrat to visit the black virgin, enlisting her help in avoiding relegation, salvation delivered soon after. And Raúl Madero, the Argentinian national team doctor, twice visited the wailing wall. The first time, before the 1986 World Cup, he asked for them to be champions; when he went back four years later, he thought that would be pushing it, so requested runners-up. True story, and when it comes to football you’ll try anything. Sometimes it even works. Some turn to God, others turn their back on Him. Coco Basile tells of the priest he kicked out of the San Lorenzo dressing room. His name was Jorge, a fan who loved his team and prayed with them; he was also a jinx, Basile said. Fifteen years later, Jorge became Pope Francis. Meanwhile, up in A Coruña, Deportivo have been known to cast a pagan’s spell,: “Beelzebub’s fire, burning corpses and farts from infernal bottoms” thrown into a bubbling cauldron. Like many rituals, it doesn’t always work, but you’ve got to have something to turn to: some source of solace or inspiration, even if it’s not so much Papa Francisco as Pape Souaré, more Delaney than divine.  And so it was that Getafe turned to Crystal Palace. Which might sound a bit weird, but while there’s no sign of the Messiah they did have Fosu-Mensah, and Getafe were desperate. They were also pointless and you can insert your own joke here. “One point would give us life,” striker Jaime Mata insisted, but their vital signs were fading fast, each defeat crueller and more inevitable than the last. Seven games in, they had lost all seven, already adrift at the bottom. “You get the feeling you’ve seen this film before,” their then-manager Míchel González had said, and it didn’t have a happy ending. “Anxiety is inevitable.” No one had ever started a top-flight season as badly, after all. No one in Spain, anyway. Not long ago there was a team in south London that were even worse and somehow they survived, rescued by Roy Hodgson. Seven weeks into the 2017-2018 season, Crystal Palace had lost all seven games. In the eighth, they defeated Chelsea and eventually finished 11th. Getafe made a motivational video, all dramatic music and headlines, drawing on Palace’s experience to declare: “When results don’t come ... when you try but don’t succeed ... history shows it’s still possible. It was too. Andros Townsend moves in mysterious ways. That day, Getafe had no points and were bottom. Yesterday, they defeated Real Madrid 1-0 at the Coliseum, the afternoon spent singing in the sun, welcoming in the new year. “Liberation,” goalscorer Enes Unal called it. This was their first win over Madrid in almost nine years, but it wasn’t a one-off or a fluke. Yes, they were gifted the goal, Éder Militão robbed by Unal – the perfect illustration of Carlo Ancelotti’s line about preferring “pessimistic” defenders who fear the worst – and sure, Ancelotti insisted the visitors “were still on holiday”. But that probably overplayed their passivity and this wasn’t only about Madrid, it was about Getafe too. Seemingly down then, they now have 18 points and are five places and 10 points off the bottom. Unbeaten in six, they’ve lost only one in nine. “The mental state is different now,” their coach said afterwards. “It’s interesting watching a team convert negative energy into positive, how horizons can change, how a group is transformed.” Which is exactly what he came for. There was a moment earlier this season when the pitchside reporter helpfully pointed out that the fans were still chanting Míchel’s name, which indeed they were; it was just a pity it was followed by the words go and now. When now arrived and Míchel was sacked in October, Getafe had actually just got their first point with a 1-1 draw against Real Sociedad but he was replaced by Quique Sánchez Flores, returning for his third spell 16 years after the first. Forty years old when he led Getafe’s debut in primera, at 56 his mission now was to keep them there. He couldn’t turn them down: “Getafe is a family, and the family has problems,” he said. Under Míchel, Getafe earned one point from 24. Under Quique, they earned 17 of 33. A table of his time there has them fifth in La Liga. Those stats probably make it sound more clear-cut than it really is. The night Getafe finally picked up a point, Real Sociedad manager Imanol Alguacil insisted: “I have no doubt Míchel’s a great coach. If you have patience with him, Getafe will climb the table.” Míchel had waited a year to take over and brought a new, possession-based style that was always likely to take a little time and luck, plus the players to play it, but he didn’t get that. Even Sánchez Flores admitted: “Míchel’s a great guy who didn’t get the luck he deserves.” And if fortune always feels empty as an explanation, there was definitely something in that. Against Valencia on the opening day, Getafe had lost 1-0 to a ropey penalty. A 93rd-minute Érik Lamela goal defeated them the following week in Seville. They were unfortunate to lose 2-1 at Barcelona, were beaten 1-0 by Elche, and were 1-0 up against Atlético until Carles Aleñá was sent off, losing 2-1 to a last-minute Luis Suárez winner. In the opening six games only Rayo beat them by more than one – and even then they had hit the post at 0-0. “It’s a question of time,” midfielder Florentino Luís said, but time passed and they kept losing, confidence crumbling. The Elche match brought 20 minutes as bad as anything you’ve seen, like the players’ legs had been put on the wrong way round, like some mental block had taken hold and wouldn’t let go. “You just have to go back to the cinema and hope this time the good guys win,” Míchel said, but they never did. Perhaps they had to stop being the good guys. Quique changed the mentality and the approach was altered too. He had to break that run somehow, rid them of the fatalism, clear heads and offer a clear plan. Get closer to what they had been with Pepe Bordalás, perhaps: tough, defensive, resistant. Unal soon talked about a side getting its identity back. It wasn’t always pretty, it is true, and it’s not done yet either. Against Levante, the 0-0 felt inevitable. Against Celta, they played four central midfielders and a fifth, Nikola Maksimovic, up front – and lost, heavily. Against Granada, they conceded in the 97th minute to draw 1-1, but it was a miracle the goal hadn’t come sooner and been followed by more. Luis Suárez’s penalty traced an almost impossible vertical trajectory over the bar, David Soria slapped one off the line and Getafe, moving to a back five, had 23% of possession and faced 18 shots. Quique admitted: “We didn’t feel good with the ball so we decided to defend.” Those were his first three games. After a 0-0 draw with Mallorca in November, Jaume Costa accused Getafe of constant fouling, complaining: “the linesman said they’re smart. Smart?! No. Book one and it stops.” But things had shifted, signs of life and rebellion. “We need a big heart and a hungry mind but things only change with a win,” Quique said after Granada and three days later it came, Unal scoring two beauties against Espanyol and Erick Cabaco stumbling down the touchline with the coach in his arms at full-time. “We needed this jubilation to justify the effort,” Quique said. “It’s going to be long and we’re going to suffer: it’s battle for the broken-hearted.” A week on they lost to Villarreal but haven’t lost since. A 4-0 win over Cádiz followed, then three draws: 0-0, 0-0, 1-1. Next, a 93rd-minute Darío Poveda goal defeated Osasuna and finally lifted them out of the relegation zone, 4,772 fans going wild. “We’re a single mind: we’re overcoming small barriers, which makes us freer and braver,” the coach said. “I feel emotional because I feel what I felt sixteen years ago.” Valencia 1-2 Espanyol, Getafe 1-0 Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid 2-0 Rayo Vallecano, Elche 0-0 Granada, Alavés 1-1 Real Sociedad, Real Betis 0-2 Celta Vigo, Mallorca 0-1 Barcelona Sunday felt even better: victory over Madrid, previously unbeaten in 12 games. “You don’t look at the stats in advance because they can depress you,” Quique insisted. “Instead, games require an artisanal process which that generates enthusiasm as you see what you can do.” Getafe, he said, had to know where to “strangle” Madrid. And as Luka Modric hit the bar and Soria made a superb late save, they did so successfully. Stefan Mitrovic’s insistence that their mentality has changed was echoed in Unal saying he smelt blood on the goal, someone else’s weakness revealed instead of theirs. “We have an important combative spirit; we needed resilience and still do: this has only just begun,” the coach said. In the stands they were jumping about singing, an old favourite adapted for new times. “Bordalás, I loved you,” it runs, “but now I love Quique.” Carry on like this and there might just be a little soft spot for Wilfried Zaha too.",Sport/Football,Getafe roll over Real Madrid in great escape bid inspired by Crystal Palace | Sid Lowe,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/03/getafe-real-madrid-crystal-palace-la-liga-blog
