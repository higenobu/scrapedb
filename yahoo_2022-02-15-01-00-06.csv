2/15/2022,"MULTAN, Pakistan (AP) — A Pakistani man sentenced to life in prison in 2019 for strangling his sister, a model on social media, was acquitted of murder Monday after his parents pardoned him under Islamic law, an attorney for the man's family said. Waseem Azeem was arrested in 2016 after he confessed to killing Qandeel Baloch, 26, for posting what he called “shameful” pictures on Facebook. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison but his parents had sought his release, said Sardar Mahboob, a lawyer who represents Azeem and his family. Islamic law in Pakistan allows a murder victim’s family to pardon a convicted killer. Baloch’s murder at the time drew nationwide condemnation, but critics suspected Azeem could walk out of prison after his conviction if his parents forgave him. Mahboob said Azeem could be freed as early as this week after the completion of paperwork. The siblings' mother, Anwar Bibi, welcomed the court order. “I am happy over the acquittal of my son, but we are still sad for our daughter's loss,"" she said. She told reporters that her slain daughter cannot come back “but I am thankful to the court, which ordered the release of my son at our request."" Baloch was found strangled in her home near the city of Multan in Punjab province. She was killed after she posted racy pictures on Facebook of herself with a Muslim cleric, Mufti Abdul Qawi, who was later arrested for his alleged involvement in the murder. The cleric was later freed as police said they could not establish a link to the murder. Nearly 1,000 Pakistani women are murdered by close relatives each year in so-called “honor killings” for violating conservative norms on love and marriage. Such killings are considered murder. But Islamic law in Pakistan allows a murder victim’s family to pardon the killer, which often allows those convicted of honor killings to escape punishment.",World/Associated Press,Pakistani court acquits model's killer on parents' pardon,https://news.yahoo.com/pakistani-court-acquits-models-killer-142913689.html
2/15/2022,"For months, scientists, public health officials, politicians and the general public have debated whether prior SARS-CoV-2 infection — touted as “natural immunity” — offers protection against COVID-19 that is comparable to vaccines. The answer to that debate is complicated, but studies show the best way to protect yourself against the Omicron variant of the coronavirus is to get vaccinated and then boosted. An infection on top of that, while not desirable, offers even more protection. Recent evidence suggests that “natural” COVID-19 protection depends on many factors, including when the infection happened, the variant involved, whether someone has been boosted or not, and the overall strength of their immune system. “The question about natural versus vaccination immunity is an important one,” Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease specialist and professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, told Yahoo News. “The CDC showed that up to the Delta surge, no doubt, natural immunity is likely as protective or more protective even than your two-dose vaccines,” she added. Gandhi was referring to a study published two weeks ago in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. It is the same study that GOP lawmakers pointed to this week when introducing the “Natural Immunity Transparency Act,” arguing that the CDC data “demonstrated natural immunity was 3-4 times as effective in preventing COVID-19 compared with vaccination.” But this claim needs more context. The CDC study analyzed COVID-19 cases in California and New York in 2021, which together only account for about 18 percent of the U.S. population. The data was collected from May 30 to Nov. 20, 2021, a period before and during the Delta wave. The study showed that prior to Delta, which became predominant in late June and July 2021, case rates were lowest for people who were vaccinated and not previously infected with COVID-19. But by early October, when Delta was dominant, the picture changed. Case rates then were substantially lower among both unvaccinated and vaccinated people with previous infections, suggesting that natural immunity during this period was superior to vaccines. However, it is important to note that the CDC research was conducted during a time when vaccine-induced immunity was waning for many people and before the emergence of the highly transmissible Omicron variant. Additionally, most U.S. adults were not yet eligible to receive booster shots, which are seen as offering the best protection against Omicron. In general, studies conducted pre-Omicron do support the concept that infection-induced immunity and vaccine-induced immunity are pretty similar in terms of protection. However, Gandhi said there are many reasons vaccines are preferred. Notably, vaccines are free, safe and quick, while getting COVID-19 carries substantial risks, including long COVID, hospitalization and death. “It’s just safer,” Gandhi said. She also said natural immunity can vary substantially from person to person, depending on many factors like age, the overall strength of the person’s immune system, how severe the COVID case was and the variant that infected them. “What happens with natural infection is that if you have a mild infection, you may not mount the strong cellular immune response that you need to fight it in the future,” Gandhi said. On the other hand, vaccines were subject to rigorous trials and found to elicit a high immune response. Most experts agree that a vaccine is a more quantifiable, predictable and reliable way to protect the population. Another downside to relying on natural immunity is that Omicron has replaced Delta as the dominant variant, and Omicron is both more transmissible and more capable of evading immune protection triggered by both vaccines and previous infections. Shane Crotty, a virologist and professor at La Jolla Institute for Immunology, told Yahoo News that the Omicron variant changed everything. “Omicron is looking so different from the other variants that just infection alone might not be giving you great antibodies against the other variants because it looks so different,” he said. It is still unclear how much immunity one can expect to come out of an Omicron infection, including how long that protection lasts and whether it will apply to future variants. Based on the epidemiological data available, Crotty said, those who are likely to be the most protected against both infection and hospitalization at the moment are people who have had a breakthrough infection. This means, individuals who have had an infection and then a vaccine, or vice versa. “Data by tons of labs shows that those people make really broad neutralizing antibodies,” the professor said. “Their antibodies recognize every possible variant and even distant viral species, but they also make really high levels of those antibodies,” he added. People in this category — both infection and vaccination — have what has become to be known as “hybrid immunity” or “super immunity.” According to a CDC study, those who get fully vaccinated after recovering from COVID-19 have twice the protection of those who do not get vaccinated after their recovery. Experts warn, however, this doesn’t mean people should purposefully try to infect themselves with the coronavirus to achieve greater protection against COVID-19, since there are serious health risks involved. People who are boosted also have an especially high level of protection against Omicron. “It’s pretty amazing three doses of the same vaccine, which is just against the ancestral strain. Your immune system is so clever. It’s seeing that old version of the spike protein basically, and the first two times it sees it, it makes neutralizing antibodies against the ancestral strain and a couple of variants, but not Omicron, but just seeing that same vaccine the third time, and now you make neutralizing antibodies against Omicron,” Crotty explained. Underscoring the value of a third dose, recent studies by the CDC have shown a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine significantly reduces a person’s chance of hospitalization from the Omicron variant. One of the CDC reports, which looked at 259 hospitals and 383 emergency departments from late August through early January, found that a third dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine was 90 percent effective at preventing hospitalization and 82 percent effective at preventing emergency department and urgent care visits. However, despite the evidence supporting the efficacy of a third dose, many Americans have been hesitant to receive their booster shots. Gandhi says this is unfortunate because boosters could be the ticket back to normal, and those who are unboosted or unvaccinated are more vulnerable to Omicron and future variants that could emerge. “What we need to get through this time is immunity ... so even if you’ve been actually infected, I really would recommend at least one dose of a vaccine,” Gandhi said.",Health/Yahoo News,How strong is your immunity against Omicron?,https://news.yahoo.com/how-strong-is-your-immunity-against-omicron-151320307.html
2/15/2022,"One dinner patron has died and seven remain hospitalized after drinking Champagne laced with Ecstasy at a Valentine’s weekend dinner at an Italian restaurant in Weiden, Germany. Police have opened a negligent-homicide investigation into the death after finding more than 1,000 times the normal dosage of the drug in the Champagne. The content was so high it had turned the champagne purple, German media report. Local media reports suggest the diners were celebrating an early Valentines Day on Sunday night at the restaurant, where they watched television and then ordered a bottle if the apparently poisoned bubbly. Witnesses say the diners toasted and took only one drink before falling ill. “We can confirm that after the first investigations there was Ecstasy in the liquid, in a significant concentration,” senior public prosecutor Gerd Schäfer told reporters Monday. “There were things in it that don’t actually happen in a Champagne.” A spokesman for local police said the bottle was in its original packaging and opened at the table in front of the guests and it is unclear how the substance made its way into the bottle. German media have reported that the bottle may have been used in illegal drug trafficking and perhaps did not contain Champagne at all, but rather a substance to keep the drug in liquid form. Police are investigating how the restaurant acquired the champagne and if there are other bottles in their wine cellar. Patrons at the restaurant described how, one by one, the people at the table started having seizures or passing out after taking just one sip. When first responders arrived after midnight, several of the stricken diners, ranging in age from 33 to 52, were sprawled out on the floor, a police spokesperson told reporters Monday morning. “Some of them showed symptoms of poisoning,” the spokesperson said. A 52-year-old male died in a hospital emergency room, which was closed off out of fears of contamination tied to the tragedy. Lab reports confirmed the identity of the substance Monday, but the prosecutor did not say if arrests were imminent. Read more at The Daily Beast.

2/15/2022,"The Tina Peters turmoil is only getting stranger — and more alarming. The latest: The Mesa County clerk — a prominent player in the unfounded theories about 2020 election fraud — kicked and cursed at police officers who were arresting her for resisting a search warrant, according to body camera footage released Friday. Stay on top of the latest market trends and economic insights with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free Peters, a Republican, attempted to prevent officers from obtaining her iPad on Tuesday, according to the Daily Sentinel in Grand Junction. She now faces two misdemeanor charges of obstructing justice. Prosecutors seized the device after she allegedly improperly video recorded a court hearing regarding harassment complaints against her deputy. She told the judge she wasn't recording. Why it matters: The warrant and criminal charges are not related to the numerous ongoing federal and state investigations into Peters regarding election tampering, wire fraud and other campaign finance violations. But they energized local and national conspiracy theorists and amplified calls by the extreme right to defy law enforcement. The focus on Peters also raises the stakes of her re-election campaign, where she is backed by former President Trump's supporters. What they're saying: So far, prominent Republicans are keeping mum on the situation. Colorado GOP chair Kristi Burton Brown told 9News after Peters' arrest that the party ""believes in law and order,"" adding ""the legal process should work its way out."" Context: Peters is pushing unfounded claims that Colorado, where Trump lost by 13.5 percentage points to now President Biden, destroyed election records and committed other fraudulent acts. She says 29,000 election files were discarded, but her own election division says they are backed up. Peters downplays that she didn't count more than 500 ballots in the 2019 election. The other side: Peters dismisses all the controversy surrounding her. ""Things are changing, and moving towards freedom. I won't quit against corruption,"" she told supporters in January, as she announced her bid for a second term. The intrigue: Two days after her arrest, right-wing group FEC United hosted an ""emergency town hall"" in Castle Rock with Peters and other election conspiracy theorists, including Colorado lawmaker and U.S. Senate candidate Ron Hanks. At the event, one person accused Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold of election fraud, and then said such people ""deserve to hang."" Griswold told 9News she reported the threat to law enforcement.

2/15/2022,"MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell couldn't pronounce the name of the man he had supposedly endorsed for Ohio governor earlier that day. ""The Jim Renacci (Reh-NEE-shaw) endorsement in Ohio. I did not endorse him,"" Lindell said on a livestreamed Facebook video. ""People were misconstrued. There was a lot of confusion. Somebody put it out there."" That somebody was the campaign of former U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci, one of three Republicans hoping to unseat GOP Gov. Mike DeWine in this May's primary. Shortly before 9 a.m. Friday, Renacci emailed media to tout his new endorsement: ""Mike Lindell has entered the Ohio Political Scene this week, endorsing Jim Renacci for Governor of Ohio in his bid to remove RINO Mike Dewine."" But that endorsement quickly unraveled, smothered either because of miscommunication, an unreliable endorser or backlash against Renacci from Republicans who see him as another ""Republican in Name Only."" But first, who is Mike Lindell and why would a candidate want his endorsement? Lindell is a former crack addict turned evangelical Christian and ally of former President Donald Trump. The CEO of a Minnesota-based pillow manufacturing company, Lindell is best known for pushing 2020 election conspiracies. Dominion Voting Systems has sued Lindell, saying he “knowingly lied about Dominion to sell more pillows to people who continued tuning in to hear what they wanted to hear about the election."" But Lindell also has a significant following, especially among Trump supporters. Right now, Renacci, former state Rep. Ron Hood and Canal Winchester businessman Joe Blystone are fighting to distinguish themselves as the most viable alternative to DeWine. A nod from Lindell could help that quest. It appeared on Friday morning that Renacci had won the pillow fight – until he hadn't. A few hours after Renacci touted the endorsement, Cincinnati-area chemist Douglas Frank, who is also a purveyor of election falsehoods, shared a text message chain that he said was between him and a baffled Lindell. ""Everyone is atwitter in Ohio, wondering why you would endorse an establishment RINO who has been calling you a nutjob for over a year,"" Frank, who backs Blystone for governor, wrote in a text message to Lindell. ""Tell them I am not endorsing him !!!!"" Lindell supposedly replied to Frank. But the Renacci campaign didn't waver. A spokesman said Renacci's running mate Joe Knopp had spoken with Lindell three times that day. Then came Lindell's Facebook livestream. ""So that is not true with Jim – Reh-NAH-she or NAH-key, NAH-she? – endorsement. That is not true,"" Lindell said. The proper pronunciation is reh-NAY-see. Shortly after, Renacci adviser Brad Parscale responded on Facebook, saying Lindell had promised his endorsement to friend Knopp in text messages. ""Well I thought Mike Lindell was an honorable man. I was wrong,"" Parscale wrote. ""Giving your word to someone and then calling them a liar is the worst. Especially a friend. Mike, sad to see what you have become."" On Saturday morning, Renacci's campaign still sent out text messages to Republicans touting the endorsement. Even now, Renacci spokesman Tom Weyland called the Lindell endorsement ""pending"" rather than completely off the table. The two will both be in Canton together. The Lindell debacle comes as a possible Trump endorsement looms over the GOP primary. Trump backed Renacci in the 2018 race for U.S. Senate against Democrat Sherrod Brown, sending then-Vice President Mike Pence to campaign for Renacci. But Renacci ultimately lost that race, so it's unclear whether Trump would endorse him again. Was the DeWine campaign paying any attention as the Lindell endorsement was laid to rest?

2/15/2022,"A leak site says it has received a cache of information, including about donors to the Ottawa truckers' Freedom Convoy protest, after fundraising site GiveSendGo was targeted by hackers overnight. On Monday, GiveSendGo's website said it was ""under maintenance,"" hours after the site was hijacked and redirected to a page believed to be controlled by the hackers, which no longer loads. The redirected page condemned the truckers who descended on Canada's capital to oppose mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations, causing widespread disruption to traffic and trade for more than a week. The page also contained a link to a file containing tens of thousands of records of what was described as ""raw donation data"" about those who donated to the Freedom Convoy. A short time later, non-profit leak site Distributed Denial of Secrets said it had received 30 megabytes of donor information from GiveSendGo, including self-reported names, email addresses, ZIP codes, and IP addresses for ""every campaign"" run on the site. Distributed Denial of Secrets, a site known for hosting sets of leaked data involving far-right groups, said that the data would only be provided to researchers and journalists. The breach is separate from an earlier security lapse, in which GiveSendGo left an Amazon-hosted S3 bucket storing over a thousand identity documents exposed to the internet, according to journalist Mikael Thalen, who first reported the data breach overnight. The Boston, Massachusetts-based GiveSendGo became the primary donation service for the ""Freedom Convoy"" last month after GoFundMe halted the crowdsourcing campaign and froze millions of dollars in donations, citing police reports of violence across Ottawa. Over the weekend, a Canadian court issued an order halting access to the funds collected by GiveSendGo, which the company said it would defy. Earlier in the month, the protesters raised more than $8 million for the Freedom Convoy. GiveSendGo co-founder Jacob Wells did not respond to a request for comment.
