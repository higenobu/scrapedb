3/12/2022,"Getty COVID-19 new variant mutation Another new COVID-19 variant has been detected. The World Health Organization has confirmed that the new variant, dubbed Deltacron — a combination of Delta and Omicron — has been detected in the France, Denmark and the Netherlands. ""The hybrid genome harbors signature mutations of the two lineages,"" said IHU Méditerranée Infection's Philippe Colson in a study published Tuesday. While evidence of the new variant has been observed, cases are few. According to Reuters, researchers have identified 17 confirmed instances in both Europe and the United States. The IHU study also noted that more cases would need to emerge for researchers to be able to effectively detect the severity of the variant.

Getty PCR test swab RELATED: Even Mild Cases of COVID Can Cause Brain Damage and Shrinkage, Study Finds In a Wednesday media briefing, WHO COVID-19 technical lead Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove said of Deltacron, ""We have not seen any change in the epidemiology with this recombinant. We haven't seen any change in severity. But there are many studies that are underway."" She also confirmed the detection of the Deltacron variant, but noted that ""there are very low levels of this detection."" On a grander scale, however, Kerkhove said, ""Unfortunately this virus will take opportunities to continue to spread."" WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus similarly stressed during the briefing, ""The virus continues to evolve. And we continue to face major obstacles in distributing vaccines, tests and treatments everywhere they're needed."" RELATED VIDEO: Doctor Says Fully Vaccinated People Are Going to Test Positive with Omicron: ""Our New Normal"" Meanwhile, researchers at Helix, a lab headquartered in San Mateo, California, found more than 20 positive COVID-19 cases containing material from both Delta and Omicron in samples tested from Nov. 22, 2021, to Feb. 13, 2022, USA Today reported Thursday. However, ""The fact that there is not that much of it, that even the two cases we saw were different, suggests that it's probably not going to elevate to a variant of concern level,"" Helix Chief Science Office William Lee told the outlet, of the two cases they found that specifically contained a combination of genetic material from Delta and Omicron. As for whether people ""need to be concerned,"" Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health epidemiologist William Hanage told USA Today no, since Deltacron is ""not causing lots of cases."" ""It's only a variant if it produces a large number of cases,"" Hanage said.

3/12/2022,"Former Miss Ukraine Veronika Didusenko is speaking out about how the United States can help her home country amid the ongoing Russian invasion. Didusenko, 26, who was crowned Miss Ukraine in 2018 but was later disqualified after pageant organizers learned she was a divorced mom, shared her heartbreak with Extra over the conflict. She was able to flee the country following the invasion with her 7-year-old son, telling Extra host Billy Bush of the ""dangerous"" ordeal, ""The Russian military forces started to bomb in Kyiv at 5 in in the morning ... We packed very fast and we took our car. We just left. We were driving for like 18 hours… the military cars on the one side and the passengers on the other side. So it will end with Russian helicopters flying over our heads. It was really scary."" Didusenko is currently in L.A. Her son is in Switzerland with his friends, and Didusenko plans to reunite with him this week. She also called for President Biden to continue to provide aid for Ukraine, calling for ""weapons, supplies."" ""We need more sanctions against Russia,"" Didusenko said. “We want peaceful citizens to be able to leave the war zone. So that is [the] number one priority right now to save people's lives in Ukraine,"" she said. ""The whole Ukraine is united right now ... We believe that we can resist and we can fight back. We will fight and win in this war. And we are staying for our freedom. And for our land."" Didusenko is joined by others who are calling for aid to Ukraine. Maksim Chmerkovskiy, a professional dancer on Dancing With the Stars who grew up in Ukraine, documented his experience in Kyiv just as the invasion began. Though he has since returned to America, he plans to return to Europe to ""join the efforts on the ground."" Sean Penn, who is making a documentary about the ongoing conflict, recently spoke to Anderson Cooper and called for America to do more for Ukraine, for the sake of not just the people of the country, but democracy around the globe. ""[Ukrainians] are fighting for their lives, and will continue to fight for their lives, and I feel that we as Americans are plummeting off a cliff — the top of which is our flag which represents all of our dreams and the best of our dreams,” he explained. ""We're plummeting where it will go out of our sight. I don't know the answers. I don't know if 'no fly zones' will create a nuclear war. I do know that we have to invest everything that we have to support the Ukrainian people, and support President Zelensky, or we will not have a memory of what America used to be."" Sean Penn is calling on the United States and Poland to get those fighter jets to Ukraine as soon as possible — and he wants the public's help.

3/12/2022,"The Philippine government is reportedly willing to open the country to American troops should the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine escalate into a fight with U.S. involvement.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte cited the country’s 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty with the U.S. in a recent meeting in Manila, according to Ambassador Jose Manuel del Gallego Romualdez, Manila’s envoy to Washington, on Thursday.

Under the treaty, the U.S. and the Philippines must come to the aid of the other should an attack ensue.

While Duterte spent the early years of his presidency openly criticizing U.S. policies, American officials have reportedly given their assurance that they would honor their treaty should Filipino forces ever come under attack.

Romualdez said Duterte expressed concern over the current crisis and its impact on the international economy.

The Philippines is one of the countries that has condemned Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. The Southeast Asian nation also voted in favor of a UN General Assembly resolution urging Russia to withdraw its troops from Ukraine.

Duterte, who has maintained close relationships with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping throughout his presidency, is nearing the end of his six-year term in June.

According to Romualdez, however, Duterte does not support Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“He says if [the U.S. is] asking for the support of the Philippines, it’s very clear that, of course, if push comes to shove, the Philippines will be ready to be part of the effort, especially if this Ukrainian crisis spills over to the Asian region,” Romualdez told journalists in Manila. “Give them the assurance that if ever needed, the Philippines is ready to offer whatever facilities or whatever things that the United States will need being a major — our number one ally.”

While Duterte did not discuss which facilities would be open for American forces, Romualdez mentioned the freeports of Clark and Subic Bay, two areas where former American air and naval bases thrived until their closure in 1992.

Duterte’s message comes as ambassadors of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations

are set to meet with U.S. national security officials at the White House this week. Romualdez said their meeting will focus on discussions about the sanctions that the U.S. imposed on Russia earlier this month.
