2/16/2022,"By Raphael Satter and Anna Mehler Paperny LONDON/TORONTO (Reuters) -A website devoted to disseminating leaked data says it was given reams of information about donors to a Canadian movement opposed to pandemic health measures after a fundraising platform popular with supporters of the group allegedly suffered a hack. Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDoS) said on its website late on Sunday that it had 30 megabytes of donor information from the U.S.-based Christian fundraising site GiveSendGo, including names, email addresses, ZIP codes and internet protocol addresses. The funding of the Canadian protests has emerged as a key point of interest as authorities in Ottawa and elsewhere try to get a grip on rallies led by truckers that have been blockading cities and border crossings across Canada with demands that include the deposition of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. In an email on Monday, a GiveSendGo spokesperson said that the site was still soliciting donations to the ""Freedom Convoy 2022"" campaign and that donations were not being refunded. The spokesperson did not immediately comment on the hack itself. The site, however, appeared to be offline. Website visitors were met with a message that it was under maintenance and ""we will be back very soon."" GiveSendGo had previously asserted it was not subject to a Canadian court order that froze these funds. A journalist at the Daily Dot digital news outlet said on Twitter that the GiveSendGo site suffered a hack overnight and had its front page briefly replaced by a clip from the movie ""Frozen"" and a manifesto accusing it of supporting ""an insurrection in Ottawa."" Reuters could neither immediately confirm the hack nor the leak claims, although Distributed Denial of Secrets has a long record of hosting leaked data from right-wing organizations, including the far-right Patriot Front and the Oath Keepers. DDoS said that because the donor information contained sensitive personal information, it would not be making the data available publicly but would instead be offering it to ""journalists and researchers."" DDoS describes itself as a non-profit devoted to enabling the free transmission of data in the public interest. GiveSendGo became a prime conduit for money to the protesters after mainstream crowdfunding platform GoFundMe blocked donations to the self-declared Freedom Convoy. Earlier this month the group said it had raised $8 million for the protests. North America's busiest trade link reopened for traffic late on Sunday, ending a six-day blockade, Canada Border Services Agency said, after Canadian police cleared the protesters fighting to end COVID-19 restrictions.

2/16/2022,"When Teresa first appeared on Dr. Phil in the Season 19 episode, “Our Daughter is Pregnant and Addicted to Heroin”, she was homeless, dependent on heroin, and a few weeks away from giving birth. Admitting that she had not been able to stop using during her pregnancy, Teresa said that she didn’t want to do any more damage to her unborn child than she already had. Advising Teresa that “Quitting cold-turkey is not an option right now,” because it would be too risky for both her and her unborn child, OB-GYN Dr. Thaïs Aliabadi offered to help Teresa through the final weeks of her pregnancy with specialized treatment and prenatal care. Baby Coco was delivered via cesarean section four weeks later. “She was extremely sick, withdrawing from heroin and meth,” says Dr. Aliabadi, who, in addition to delivering Coco, became a foster mother to the infant. “With a lot of love, and with the help of tons of doctors – we have been able to completely heal her.” Now 14-months-old, Dr. Aliabadi describes Coco as “extremely bright” and “The happiest baby on the block.” Dr. Aliabadi’s older daughters, Delara and Layla, say their foster sister inspired them to start Coco’s Angels, a non-profit foundation dedicated to helping children in the Los Angeles foster care system.

2/16/2022,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — Prosecutors are seeking to keep in custody a homeless man suspected of stabbing 11 people in a matter of hours as he rode a bicycle around Albuquerque on Sunday, saying no conditions of release could reasonably ensure the safety of the community. Tobias Gutierrez, who has a lengthy criminal history, appeared in court virtually Tuesday on charges of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. A public safety assessment tool used by judges in New Mexico's largest city to determine whether a defendant can be released pending trial under certain conditions recommends that Gutierrez be released based on factors that include his age, previous history and the current charges. Prosecutors argued otherwise in a pretrial detention motion. “It is hard to imagine a person more dangerous that hurt more people than the defendant,” the motion states. “With so many victims and with no clear motive or reason, it is clear that the defendant is an extremely violent and dangerous person. The only way to protect our community is to hold the defendant in custody until this matter is resolved at trial.” A state district judge will consider the motion at an upcoming hearing. While Gutierrez was represented Tuesday by a public defender, an attorney who could speak on his behalf has yet to be appointed. The case comes as legislative efforts to overhaul the state’s troubled pretrial release program have all but stalled despite strong momentum for change in January when the session began. That was fueled partly by Albuquerque marking a year of record homicides and growing frustration among families who had lost loved ones to violent crime. Lauren Rodriguez, a spokeswoman for District Attorney Raúl Torrez, said the Gutierrez case marks the second time in a week that the court's public safety assessment framework has recommended release for what prosecutors consider a dangerous person. “Apparently even facing charges of stabbing 11 different people in broad daylight isn’t enough to keep someone behind bars using this instrument,” she said. “Unfortunately, while 77% of the public wants the revolving door shut on these types of violent offenders, the Legislature has once again failed to address the issue or even acknowledge the problem."" Despite the recommendations of the assessment, she said she was hopeful judges would use their discretion when considering detention motions. Sunday's stabbings appeared to have been committed at random within hours along Central Avenue, one of the city’s main thoroughfares. One of the crime scenes included a homeless encampment and another was near a smoke shop where the suspect asked a victim for money and yelled obscenities before swinging a knife, according to a criminal complaint. The witnesses identified a man on a bike armed with a large knife. Some described the man as acting strangely and said he appeared to be upset. New Mexico court records show Gutierrez's criminal history included felony offenses that ranged from burglary to battery, possession of a controlled substance and driving while intoxicated. In 2014, he was sentenced to federal prison after trying to take a revolver and ammunition into a tribal casino and prompting a police pursuit.",U.S./Associated Press,Prosecutors: 'Hard to imagine a person more dangerous',https://news.yahoo.com/prosecutors-hard-imagine-person-more-222553376.html
2/16/2022,"Trumpworld erupted over a new court filing from the special counsel John Durham. They said the filing contains definitive proof that Democrats illegally spied on Trump in 2016 and 2017. But the filing says nothing of the sort. The right-wing media sphere erupted this week over a legal filing from the special counsel John Durham, who is investigating the origins of the FBI's Russia probe, that former President Donald Trump and his allies said presented definitive proof that his political opponents illegally ""spied"" on him. Trump declared in a statement that the filing provided ""indisputable evidence that my campaign and presidency were spied on by operatives paid by the Hillary Clinton Campaign in an effort to develop a completely fabricated connection to Russia,"" adding that such conduct ""would have been punishable by death"" in a ""stronger period of time in this country."" Trump's claim that such activity would have at any time in American history been ""punishable by death"" is false and misleading, since the only crime Durham has accused anyone of committing is lying to the FBI. No one involved in the invesitigation has been charged with illegally spying on the Trump campaign or White House, or with a capital crime. But the special counsel's investigation has in the past uncovered evidence of a connection between a lawyer with connections to the Clinton campaign named Michael Sussmann and and a technology executive who Durham claims ""exploited"" internet data legally gathered from the White House and Trump Tower. Friday's filing also suggests that Sussman exaggerated evidence of a connection between Trump and Russia in meetings with law enforcement agencies. The filing contains almost no new information. It's not an indictment, meaning that no new criminal conduct was alleged. Instead, it relates to a conflict-of-interest matter in Durham's ongoing case against Sussmann, who worked at the law firm Perkins Coie, which represents the Democratic National Committee. Sussmann was charged last year with lying to the FBI while trying to get it to investigate an allegation that the Trump campaign used a secret email server to communicate with Russia's Alfa Bank during the 2016 campaign. The FBI has not uncovered any evidence of such a connection. Durham's Friday filing said there's a potential conflict because the law firm representing Sussmann, Latham Watkins, previously represented Perkins Coie and the lawyer Marc Elias, who testified before Durham's grand jury. It also details a February 2017 meeting in which Sussmann flagged to the CIA that internet data he had obtained suggested someone using a Russian-made smartphone was connecting to White House and Trump Tower networks. The New York Times reported on this meeting last year. The filing says Sussmann got the data from an unnamed technology executive who Durham said ""exploited"" DNS traffic to gauge if there was a link between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives during the 2016 election. Multiple media outlets have reported that the executive is Rodney Joffe, who works at the American tech company Neustar. Durham's filing said some of the internet data that was mined was connected to two Trump buildings in New York City, the executive office of the president (EOP), and an unrelated Michigan hospital company that had also interacted with the Trump server. It added that Joffe had access to this data because his employer had a set of ""dedicated servers"" for the White House as part of a ""sensitive arrangement"" in which it provided DNS resolution services to the White House. As Durham pointed out later in the filing, these DNS lookups started as early as 2014, when Barack Obama was in office, and continued until early 2017. Lawyers for one of the researchers who worked with Joffe highlighted that in a statement to The Times: ""The cybersecurity researchers were investigating malware in the White House, not spying on the Trump campaign, and to our knowledge all of the data they used was nonprivate DNS data from before Trump took office."" A spokesperson for Joffe told NBC News that ""contrary to the allegations in this recent filing,"" he had legal access to the DNS data under a contract that allowed Neustar to comb through the data, including from the White House, to look for security threats. ""As a result of the [Russian government's] hacks of EOP and DNC servers in 2015 and 2016, respectively, there were serious and legitimate national security concerns about Russian attempts to infiltrate the 2016 election,"" the spokesperson continued. ""Upon identifying DNS queries from Russian-made Yota phones in proximity to the Trump campaign and the EOP, respected cyber-security researchers were deeply concerned about the anomalies they found in the data and prepared a report of their findings, which was subsequently shared with the CIA."" The Washington Post reported that internet providers frequently let third parties collect DNS lookups because the information can be helpful for tracking bad actors. DNS services like the one offered by Neustar essentially ""monitor your traffic in the event that you might be sent to a malicious site,"" Karim Hijazi, the CEO of the cybersecurity firm Prevailion and a former intelligence community contractor, told Insider. ""They'll stop the traffic, limit it, or redirect it to somewhere safe. So by definition, if you're using a service like Neustar's, your activity is being monitored because that's what you're buying."" Durham's filing noted that the lookups took place on a broader scale as well. According to the filing, Sussmann claimed the lookups ""demonstrated that Trump and/or his associates were using supposedly rare, Russian-made wireless phones in the vicinity of the White House and other locations."" But ""the more complete data"" that Joffe and his associates gathered ""reflected that between approximately 2014 and 2017, there were a total of more than 3 million lookups of Russian Phone-Provider-1 IP addresses that originated with US-based IP addresses,"" the filing said. Fewer than 1,000 of those lookups came from IP addresses affiliated with Trump Tower, it added. The information Durham laid out raises questions about the ethics of Joffe using the data his company had legal access to for purposes that went beyond the scope of what the firm was hired to do. And it's true that Durham has alleged that criminal conduct occurred. But the crime that's being alleged is lying to the FBI, not domestic political espionage or anything related to spying or hacking. That doesn't mean Durham won't bring more serious charges down the line related to Democratic efforts to establish a Trump-Russia link, or that Sussmann and his source didn't behave unethically. It just means that Friday's filing doesn't lay out any such efforts that would constitute what Trump has implied is treasonous conduct punishable by death.

2/16/2022,"Police didn’t take any chances when they responded to a call about two suspicious packages sitting on the front steps of a federal courthouse in Alabama. The Tuscaloosa Police Department documented the situation on Facebook. They were first on scene around 8:02 a.m. Monday, Feb. 14, after two employees called about unknown packages at the front of the building. Officers blocked off the street and set up a perimeter around the courthouse to prevent cars and people from passing through, police said. The department’s Hazardous Device Unit soon discovered, though, that the threatening packages were two packages of food from Taco Bell. “The investigation revealed the boxes contained what we have identified as a delivery order containing a Taco and Burrito Cravings Pack from Taco Bell,” the police department wrote on Facebook. “It had been customized to include an assortment of regular and Doritos Locos tacos, along with four beefy five-layer burritos.” By 8:20 a.m., officers had opened the roads and removed the perimeters around the courthouse and threw away the fast food. The incident drew chuckles, praise and gratitude on social media. “I think we need to have an internal investigation to find out if they really disposed of the food in the dumpster. I would have eaten it myself,” one commenter wrote. “Although this is funny…you can never be too careful nowadays. Great work TPD!” another commented.

The whale was freed Monday while swimming in the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary off Maui, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in a statement Tuesday. The calf and male weren't entangled. There was more than 500 feet of line that was wrapped tightly around the humpback's head. ""Once freed, the mother and her calf went into resting behavior, with the calf tucking under the mother’s chin.

2/16/2022,"Business leaders are clearly not buying the continuing narrative from many political leaders that efforts to overturn American democracy after the last election were “legitimate political discourse.” Newly released Federal Election Commission filings this month, now encompassing the entirety of 2021, show that all 93 of the incumbent members of Congress who failed in their constitutional duties to confirm the certified ballots of the Electoral College have suffered a major plunge in business support. We’ve seen a resurgence of whining from cynical media about companies that let expire last year’s pledges to halt donations to these “objectors” in Congress. But the chorus of corporate critics has missed the forest for the trees. According to the new FEC filings, total corporate giving to those objectors fell a staggering 60% from calendar year 2019, the equivalent stage of the last election cycle. Putting this in context: All corporate political spending on Congress is down 28%; corporate support for GOP non-objecting members of Congress slipped that same 28%; and corporate giving to Democratic members of Congress fell just 19%. Thus, while businesses have lost some interest in supporting congressional campaigns in general, by this measure they are three times more wary of assisting objectors. Leaders of the insurgency have been hit particularly hard, with Josh Hawley down 79%, Ted Cruz down 95%, Matt Gaetz down 97%, and Mo Brooks also down 97%. Even the influential House GOP leaders Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise saw their corporate donations decline, by 60% and 70% respectively. These facts will be upsetting not only to GOP objectors, but also to the business reporters and voting rights groups so eager to wrongly condemn business as the spigot to sedition. A self-styled watchdog called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington issued a recent inflammatory report titled, The Corporate Insurrection: How Companies Have Broken Promises and Funded Seditionists. Similarly, The Hill recently ran the banner headline “GOP Election Objectors Rake In Corporate Cash,” atop a story in which the publication cited a breathless report from Accountable.US, a liberal lobbying group, reporting that corporations donated $6.8 million spread across 147 objectors. These shrewd accountants at Accountable.US must not realize that this is not even 1% of total congressional campaign donations. Hundreds of companies including IBM, Levi Strauss, and Discovery never made the pledge to halt donations, because they never give political donations to begin with. Meanwhile, most of the companies that made such temporary pledges have maintained that moratorium—with the list of 78 companies tracked by Yale’s Chief Executive Leadership Institute including such iconic brands as AIG, Allstate, Alphabet, American Express, Amazon, AT&T, Verizon, Marriott, Disney, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Hartford, Travelers, Liberty Mutual, Home Depot, Dell, McDonald’s, Microsoft, Micron, Intel, eBay, BlackRock, State Street, Mastercard, Visa, Bank of America, Citi, JP Morgan, Target, and Walmart. Recently, Los Angeles Times business columnist Michael Hiltzik mistakenly asserted, “It should be obvious that corporations shouldn’t be permitted to make any campaign contributions, because their dollars will always overwhelm contributions from individuals.” This sounds sensible on its face, but the FEC data reveals the exact opposite is true. Based on our research, not only has the corporate funding of objectors plunged, but total corporate giving has fallen from 20.6% of all congressional donations in 2019 to just 13% in 2021. While total congressional campaign coffers have grown from $989 million during 2019 to $1.2 billion in 2021, only $147 million came from corporations. Yes, rather than corporations overwhelming individual contributions, it is individual contributions that have soared to 87% of total congressional campaign funding. In fact, we found corporate funding now accounts for a record low percentage of total congressional campaign fundraising. While individual donations as a percentage of total political fundraising have already been on the rise for at least a few decades—from 25% in 1977 to 55% in 1991 to 79.4% in 2019—the trend has markedly accelerated over the past few years, with the resulting climate transforming individual donors into the single most potent force in political fundraising. The misdirected fire of voting rights groups and media pundits is even more alarming given that substantial funding of the objectors comes not from business at all, but from individuals. Despite losing virtually 100% of their business support, Hawley, Cruz, Gaetz, and their peers have drawn similar or increased support from individuals. The rise of individual donors is not confined to only congressional races. According to OpenSecrets, of the $14 billion spent by all candidates and groups in the 2020 election cycle, only 5% came from corporate PACs. Individual donations made up a vast majority of funding, reinforcing the fact that reformers' focus ought to be on individual contributions rather than corporate money. The proliferating ranks of voting rights groups have piled on to the wrong mission. Business leaders have been on the frontiers of immigration rights, sustainability, gun safety, civil rights, and voting rights issues as the loudest and most trusted voices in society. By vilifying business, critics have locked, loaded, and fired upon the wrong targets entirely. The 1930s bank robber Willie Sutton explained he targeted banks “because that's where the money is.” However, the campaign money is not where the pundits and voting rights groups assumed it is. The problem may be that the goal of many of these attention-starved groups is to create dramatic, if incorrect, headlines to get more attention as they struggle for recognition and funding. Our recent research has revealed that there are now a dysfunctional overlapping mound of 188 look-alike competing voting rights groups, most created in just the past year, with funding well in excess of $300 million. Instead of the convenient, incendiary attacks on business, voting rights activists and pundits should take on the less exhibitionist tasks of courting clergy, trade unions, professional associations, pension funds, and campus voices to the cause of fortifying democracy. That more prosaic work of building broad, inclusive coalitions is what produced social change from the 1960s through the 1980s. Reaching individuals through these pillars of civil society taps the actual source of 87% of campaign dollars—individual contributors, not corporations.
