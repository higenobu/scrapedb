3/8/2022,"Ireland Baldwin is sharing how caffeine can trigger a host of health issues for her, including anxiety attacks. On Sunday, the 26-year-old model posted photos of herself curled up on her bathroom floor after suffering the after effects of drinking just ""one cup of coffee on an empty stomach."" The daughter of actors Kim Basinger and Alec Baldwin went on to explain how coffee — which she admits drinking because ""I'm a silly goose"" — is a ""major esophageal irritator and reflux trigger for me, which leads to anxiety."" ""If you are an anxiety sufferer like myself, coffee isn't your friend,"" said Baldwin, who says she has to lie down ""until I can't cry or throw up anymore"" after a caffeine-trigged episode. ""Writing this and being open with y'all about my struggles helps it pass,"" she added, urging others with similar experiences to share. Indeed, many commenters noted that they too experience anxiety or even full-blown panic attacks after having coffee. The model's father, meanwhile, chimed in with a message of support, writing, ""I love you"" in response to her post. Baldwin, who shared a rare selfie with her actress mother over the weekend, has been candid about her mental health, from posting about self-love to sharing how social media can warp her view of herself. In January, she revealed that she has cardiophobia, admitting that she lives ""in a constant fear that I’m dying from a heart attack."" In addition to seeking treatment from anxiety specialists, using her own at-home blood pressure monitoring device has helped her find calm and distinguish the physical symptoms of anxiety, such as heart palpitations, from those of a cardiac episode. ""I just want anyone who suffers from their own anxieties to know that I am here and you are not alone. It can be so embarrassing and isolating at times,” she told her followers. “My anxiety has made me miss out on a lot in this life and my true 2022 goal is not let it get in my way. I have anxiety that is caused by food, my digestive system, my heart, big crowds, talking about anxiety, airplanes, you name it. You’re not alone. Hold on to your comfort item right. Don’t let people make you feel guilty for having to take a walk or take some space or stay home because you’re not feeling good. Surround yourself with people who understand or at least try to. And if you’re feeling anxious right now … deep breaths. You’re going to be OK.” Want lifestyle and wellness news delivered to your inbox? Sign up here for Yahoo Life’s newsletter.",Health/Yahoo Life,Ireland Baldwin shares photos of herself having an anxiety attack after drinking coffee,https://news.yahoo.com/ireland-baldwin-coffee-caffeine-anxiety-210441968.html
3/8/2022,"USA TODAY Opinion asked U.S. Army Col. Yevgeny (Eugene) Vindman to give his assessment of developments in Ukraine's war with Russia. Vindman, along with his twin brother, Alexander Vindman, served on the National Security Council during the Trump administration. They raised concerns about President Donald Trump's phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in 2019; the brothers were later fired from the NSC. ""It’s hard for me to watch what (Vladimir) Putin is doing to those people and his own country,"" Vindman said. ""I also think about my mother’s grave in Kyiv and my other relatives buried there. Will I ever be able to visit their graves and lay flowers upon them? Will anything be left? I’m not sure."" Opinions in your inbox: Get a digest of our takes on current events every day Vindman spoke in his personal capacity. The views expressed are his own and not necessarily the view of the U.S. Army, the Department of Defense or the U.S. government. His conversation with USA TODAY Editorial Board members Tim Swarens and Austin Bogues has been edited for length and clarity: Q. What is your overall assessment of where things now stand in the war? Is the most likely scenario still a Russian military victory, or have the facts on the ground changed to the point where Ukrainians have a realistic chance of repelling the invasion? A. The war in Ukraine is entering a new, more deadly phase. Russian forces appear to be reverting to their old methodology of leveling cities and apparently indiscriminate bombing (see Aleppo, Syria, and Grozny, Chechnya). They are destroying many civilian areas and structures and attacking civilian facilities, including the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. The civilian death toll is likely to skyrocket. At the same time, Ukrainian forces are inflicting heavy casualties on Russian air and ground forces. Russia will not be able to sustain such casualties for very long. In their own words: Ukrainians talk about living through Russian invasion A Russian victory is not a foregone conclusion. Russian forces are underperforming, and Ukrainian forces are overperforming. Ukrainians’ will to fight is impressive, and they have proven themselves to be some of the most highly motivated and effective forces in the world, despite being under-gunned. This is in large part due to Zelenskyy's leadership. Ukrainians have a legitimate chance to repel the invasion, but the cost in civilian casualties will be high. Q. Reports indicate that Russian forces are using heavy firepower, including rockets and missiles, to attack Ukrainian cities. Have you seen evidence to suggest that Putin and Russian commanders may be guilty of war crimes? Or are we seeing the horrific but expected consequences of modern warfare when urban areas are involved?  A. There is evidence that Russian attacks are in violation of the laws of war. The four principles of the law of war are: ►Only attack targets out of military necessity or for a military objective. ►Discriminate between civilian and military targets. ►Proportionality – ensure that if you attack when civilian casualties are possible that you use only so much force as is necessary to achieve the military objective. ►Humanity – not using weapons to cause unnecessary injury or using lawful weapons in an unlawful manner. The law of war, including the Geneva Conventions on protecting civilians and civilian objects, has specific prohibitions that Russian forces appear to be violating, including attacks that fail to distinguish between military and civilian targets. Russian forces have also used Ukrainian uniforms to gain surprise when attacking Ukrainian forces. That is prohibited. Ukraine war diary:'My 10-year-old son is now making camouflage nets for military' These are all potential war crimes. They must all be documented to the greatest extent possible for future accountability. Finally, Russia withdrew from some of the Geneva Conventions' additional protocols a few years ago. This withdrawal less constrains Russian operations in some ways. It may also indicate that Russia has been planning this war for some time. Q. Do you see a likely scenario where Putin can now retreat and retain power? Or has he stumbled into a trap where he must keep fighting this war in an attempt to save his dictatorship and himself?  A. My personal opinion is that Putin's days are numbered. Putin has attempted maximalist goals – conquer all of Ukraine and pacify the population. He will not achieve these goals. Putin is a strongman who is demonstrating that he is not very strong. His only leverage against the West is nuclear war. However, he cannot push the red button on his own. He requires many subordinates to execute his orders. They are not likely interested in a war of nuclear annihilation that Putin started for no reason. He is also afraid and isolated, as demonstrated by the distance he puts between himself and others at a table. It’s hard for me to believe that someone so scared is willing to die in a nuclear holocaust. Having said all this, the risks are high, and that is why the U.S. and the West are taking a measured and restrained approach. Creatively thinking about off-ramps and engaging intermediaries, like the Israelis, is the smart and rational approach. Q. Your family has deep roots in Ukraine. What has it been like for you to watch this war unfold?  A. This war has been terrible to watch. I’ve been glued to one screen or another. Twitter has some really smart people who are scouring open-source intelligence, compiling it and providing excellent analysis. There is a fairly accurate picture of Russian casualties and material loss; those numbers are staggering. There is also a pretty good record of the Russian atrocities in the war, which will be necessary for accountability once this is over. Personally, I try to think about what I can do to help. The Ukrainians are fighting for Western values, freedom and democracy. My heart goes out to them, and I think the American people are united behind them. In a democracy, the people speak and politicians follow. If we support the Ukrainian people, then so will our governments. I was born in the Soviet Union. I speak Russian, not Ukrainian. It’s hard for me to watch what Putin is doing to those people and his own country. I also think about my mother’s grave in Kyiv and my other relatives buried there. Will I ever be able to visit their graves and lay flowers upon them? Will anything be left? I’m not sure.

3/8/2022,"Russia’s military operation in Ukraine will be “unsustainable” within three weeks, a defence expert has said. Ed Arnold, a research fellow for European security at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank, said Russia is meeting more resistance from Ukrainian troops than it expected. He told the Reuters news agency on Monday: “At the current rate of Russian losses, which are not confirmed, but we do have indications that this operation would be unsustainable within about three weeks from the Russian perspective.” He added: “In which case that they would have to consolidate the gains already made and look to see a way of trying to freeze the conflict on the current lines of advance while they mobilise more forces from Russia.” While Arnold said Russia continues its advance into Ukraine, he described its progress as “slow”. He said: “Within the north, they are still looking to fully encircle Kyiv. “In the south, the Russian advance is continued to be slow but they're seeing a lot more successes in the south, taking Kherson and consolidating and pushing further west, and then also focusing now on Mariupol. “However, at the moment, the Russian operation is going so badly, especially from logistics point of view that really Russia might just not have the numbers to make another conflict that is cold be hot again."" His comments came as Ukraine claimed on Monday it had retaken the city of Chuhuiv from Russian troops. Lieutenant General Serhiy Shaptala said defending Ukrainian forces had seized Chuhuiv from Russian control, killing two high-ranking Russian commanders in the process. Ukraine’s military, the General Staff, said on Facebook: ""In the course of hostilities, the city of Chuhuiv was liberated. Watch: Boris Johnson says Vladimir Putin 'doubling down' on level of Ukraine violence ""The occupiers suffered heavy losses in personnel and equipment.” Ukrainian and Russian negotiators are expected to sit down for a third round of peace talks on Monday. The discussions will take place in Belarus, close to the border with Poland. In the previous set of talks last Thursday, it was agreed to set up humanitarian corridors to allow refugees to flee Ukraine. But proposed ceasefire attempts in the city of Mariupol collapsed at the weekend. Russia announced new humanitarian corridors on Monday, but Ukraine branded the plans “immoral” as they would lead refugees straight into the arms of Russia and its close ally, Belarus. Meanwhile, the mayor of the Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv claimed that Russians dropped cluster bombs on residential buildings and a zoo on Monday morning. Russia issued a list of demands on Monday, saying Ukraine must follow four criteria for its invasion to stop. These included ceasing military action; changing its constitution to enshrine neutrality; acknowledging Crimea as Russian territory and recognising the separatist republics of Donetsk and Lugansk as independent territories.",World/Yahoo News UK,Russia operation in Ukraine 'will be unsustainable within three weeks',https://news.yahoo.com/russia-operation-ukraine-unsustainable-war-153037343.html

3/8/2022,"A video has surfaced in China of a Samoyed being beaten to death while its owner was in quarantine. In the video, two workers in PPE are seen beating the whimpering dog with sticks. In November, another Chinese woman said health workers entered her home while she was quarantining and beat her dog to death. A video has surfaced on Chinese social media of a pet Samoyed named Snowball being brutally beaten with sticks by PPE-clad COVID-19 workers. The dog's owner, a woman living in Huizhou city in Guangdong province, posted a statement about her pet's death on March 4 on China's Twitter-like platform Weibo. In the statement, she said that her three-year-old Samoyed was ""beaten to death with sticks."" The woman, who posted the account under her Weibo ID Yi Zhi Xue Qiu, said she was sent into isolation at a quarantine facility on March 2 after her boyfriend tested positive for COVID-19. She was not allowed to bring Snowball with her but was told that city workers would disinfect her home. The video (WARNING: the video includes graphic audio) appears to show two workers dressed in white protective gear cornering Snowball in a room. The workers approach the dog with what look to be metal rods in hand, and the dog barks at them while backing away. For reasons that were not immediately apparent, one of the workers is seen picking up another large stick. They begin to beat Snowball repeatedly. Both workers are then seen taking swipes at the dog. As the dog whimpers and yelps, the workers continue beating the animal. Soon, the dog stops making any sounds, and the workers are seen moving out of the room. The original video posted by the dog's owner has been deleted, but it was reposted both on Twitter and by other Weibo accounts. ""Snowball is like family to me,"" the dog's owner wrote. ""Without this CCTV evidence, we might still be deceived that our pet was 'humanely' put down."" The woman posted chat logs that she said were records of her communication with a government official, who asked about her dog and whether it would ""bite."" ""I was told by anti-epidemic officials that they would just be disinfecting my home, not killing my dog. Who gave them the right to do that?"" she said. ""I also applied and pleaded for the dog to just be sent into quarantine with me, but no one gave me that chance."" The Huizhou city government issued a statement on March 5 confirming the dog's death. ""We have apologized to the dog owner and will counsel and suspend the workers,"" read the statement. The death of Snowball follows an incident in November 2021, when a woman in Shangrao city in Jiangxi province said that city workers entered her home and beat her dog to death. Health authorities like the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention note that is very rare for pet animals to infect humans with COVID-19.
