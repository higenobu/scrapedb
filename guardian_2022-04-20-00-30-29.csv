4/20/2022,"A guitar belonging to Noel Gallagher, which was damaged backstage at an Oasis concert on the night they broke up, is due to be sold at auction next month. Although the guitar was later repaired, the destruction of the red Gibson ES-355 backstage at the Rock en Seine festival in Paris in 2009, was a “cult moment” in music history, according to Jonathan Berg, the co-founder of the Artpeges gallery, which is holding the auction. The starting price for the guitar, which will go on sale on 17 May, will be €150,000 (£125,000), with the auctioneers predicting it could reach more than €500,000 (£415,000). The band had been slated to headline Rock en Seine, but it was reported that Gallagher had got into a fight with his brother, Liam, minutes before their scheduled appearance. At the concert, the crowd were told by Bloc Party, who were due to perform beforehand, that Oasis would not be taking the stage. Many of the crowd thought it was a joke, until screens at either side of the main stage showed the message “as a result of an altercation within the band, the Oasis gig has been cancelled”. Gallagher later confirmed the news at the time, saying: “It’s with some sadness and great relief to tell you that I quit Oasis tonight. “People will write and say what they like but I simply could not go on working with Liam a day longer. Apologies to all the people who bought tickets to the shows in Paris, Konstanz and Milan.” The fight followed months of speculation that the band may be separating, as the brothers’ public quarrels – which had gone on for years – began to intensify. Gallagher initially repaired the instrument after the band split, although he “got rid of it in the end, because it reminds him too much of Oasis”, according to Arthur Perault, the gallery’s other co-founder. Other items being auctioned at Artpeges gallery includes a vinyl signed by both Jimi Hendrix and Johnny Hallyday, as well as bondage clothing worn by the band Depeche Mode’s Martin Gore during an 1980s photoshoot. In an interview with the Sunday Times earlier this year, Liam Gallagher said he had not seen his brother in years, saying: “We split up nearly 13 years ago. It’s ridiculous. We can go on about whose fault it is, but he’s his own man.” He added: “If he really wanted to get in contact, for my mum’s sake, he could do it, but he obviously doesn’t want to. There are only so many olive branches you can offer.”",Arts/Music,Noel Gallagher’s guitar damaged on night Oasis split goes up for auction,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/19/noel-gallagher-guitar-damaged-on-night-oasis-split-goes-up-for-auction
4/20/2022,"Senior political allies of Emmanuel Macron have lined up to warn against complacency in France’s presidential race, saying the incumbent is not certain to win despite polls indicating his lead over his far-right challenger, Marine Le Pen, is widening. “The game isn’t done and dusted and we certainly cannot draw the conclusion ... that this election is already decided,” the French prime minister, Jean Castex, told French radio, five days before Sunday’s second round runoff. “We have to convince the French that Emmanuel Macron’s programmes are the best for France and for them. Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen are being put on the same level, but there are enormous differences between them.” Castex’s immediate predecessor, Édouard Philippe, mayor of the northern city of Le Havre and, according to a recent survey, France’s most popular politician, also said nothing should be taken for granted given the many election “unknowns” – most particularly a possible low turnout. Philippe told Le Figaro that France’s “Republican front”, the alliance of centre-right and centre-left voters that has so far excluded the far right from power, was manifestly “no longer a natural reflex, doubtless due to fatigue”. François Bayrou, another heavyweight Macron backer, told La République des Pyrénées newspaper that “at this stage, either candidate could win. Everything is possible. We have all seen voters make choices historians later consider crazy.” Macron himself made clear on Monday night that he did not consider the election already won, recalling the political earthquakes of 2016 when British voters chose to leave the EU and the US electorate put Donald Trump in the White House. “Think back to what British citizens were saying hours before the Brexit referendum, or in the US before the Trump vote came: ‘I’m not voting. What’s the point?’” Macron told the TV show C à vous. “I can tell you, the next day they regretted it. If you want to avoid the unthinkable or something that revolts you, choose for yourself.” Polls suggest that since the first-round vote on 10 April, increased scrutiny of Le Pen’s manifesto – in particular her proposals for a “national preference” in jobs, welfare and housing, which experts have said would violate French and EU equality laws, and for the economy, described by economists as “dangerous” – have slowed her progress. Macron’s projected lead for Sunday’s decisive second-round vote now averages eight or nine percentage points across all polls, with the latest, published on Tuesday, suggesting the gap has widened from eight to 12 points since Friday. The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, told Europe 1 radio on Tuesday that Le Pen, who has long voiced admiration for Russia and accepted loans from Russian banks, would “hand France’s sovereignty to Vladimir Putin” if she was elected. “I heard Marine Le Pen’s international policy proposals ... This is the end of French sovereignty,” Le Maire said, adding that her victory would lead to an alliance with Putin, a lack of Nato protection and cutting ties with Germany. Castex also said his government would tender its resignation if Macron was re-elected president, in an effort to provide a “new impetus” for the president’s centrist La République En Marche party in the run-up to parliamentary elections in June. The vote in June will be a further major test of Macron’s popularity, and renewing his majority will be essential if he is to pursue his reformist agenda, including a controversial overhaul of the pensions system. Macron and Le Pen will face off on Wednesday evening during the live second-round TV debate, traditionally a key moment in French presidential elections, which could prove critical for winning over millions of voters, in particular on the left. Le Pen was reportedly rehearsing with her closest aides on Tuesday in an effort to avoid the disastrous performance that was widely seen as having precipitated her defeat in 2017.",News/World news,Macron allies warn victory not certain as poll lead over Le Pen grows,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/19/macron-allies-warn-victory-not-certain-poll-lead-le-pen-grows
4/20/2022,"An aggressive humpback whale appeared to turn the tables on a pod of orcas off the Canadian coast, stalking then ambushing the group that more usually would have been attacking it. The rare occurrence took place on the Salish Sea between British Columbia and Washington state and was witnessed and recorded by enthralled tourists on a whale-watching trip. “There’s something happening in front of us that hasn’t been seen before,” Olivia Esqueda, an environmentalist, told CHEK News. “It’s hard not to just kind of be like a kid at Disney World.” Esqueda described a 20-minute encounter in which a five-year-old humpback of undetermined sex, named Valiant, took on the nine-strong transient pod of Bigg’s orca. Orca, also known as killer whales, are the largest species of dolphin and usually feed on seals and sea lions individually but will team up to attack other whales. “The humpback whale was kind of trailing up behind them,” Esqueda said. “We all of a sudden saw the next surface with the humpback right in the middle of all the killer whales.” Valiant’s aggression might have been because it feared being attacked, experts say. An unnamed observer on the whale-watching boat Prince of Whales told the Vancouver Sun the humpback was “rolling around and trumpeting with each surfacing”, possibly to deter or distract the orcas. While video footage of such an encounter is rare, humpbacks have been known to go on the offensive. The Sun reported that in 2016 researchers from Oregon State University found 30 cases in which humpbacks attacked orcas when they were pursuing whales and other ­mammals. “The humpback whale is, to our knowledge, the only cetacean that deliberately approaches attacking mammal-eating killer whales and can drive them off,” said Dr Robert Pitman, a marine ecologist and report co-author. Mark Malleson, captain of the Prince of Whales whale-watching boat, said Valiant was known locally for its aggression, perhaps because of earlier encounters with orcas. “It’s apparent when it was a calf, when it was in its first year, it had had a close call,” he told CHEK News. “[It has] rake marks, the killer whale rake marks. It would have happened when it was with its mom.”",News/Environment,Killers confronted: humpback whale turns on orca pod in rare encounter,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/19/humpback-whale-orca-video-valiant
4/20/2022,"Maritime inspectors listed an unprecedented 31 separate failings on a P&O Ferries vessel detained last month, ranging from problems with fire safety to lifeboat drills. Inspectors for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) refused to allow the European Causeway to keep sailing from Larne, Northern Ireland, after discovering issues with labour conditions, navigation and documentation. Emerging details of the inspections show the MCA has flung the book at the ferry operator, which provoked outcry when it sacked 800 crew to replace them with cheap agency staff in March. Since then three of its vessels have been detained following inspections, with the Spirit of Britain and Pride of Kent still held in Dover after safety issues were uncovered. On the first inspection, the MCA found that the “launching arrangements for survival craft” on European Causeway were “not as required”, while an evacuation slide was not properly maintained, fire prevention systems were inadequate, and the new crew hired from abroad were insufficiently familiar with the radio equipment. According to an analysis by the PA news agency, more failures were found on the European Causeway than in 46,000 Port State Control inspections of ships in the last three years, listed under the Paris memorandum of understanding, an alliance of 27 national maritime authorities, including the UK. The European Causeway has now been passed fit and sailings have resumed on the route between Larne and Cairnryan in Scotland, as well as between Hull and Rotterdam after the Pride of Hull passed an inspection. However, P&O’s ferry services remain suspended on the main Dover-Calais crossing, contributing to huge queues of lorries trying to cross the Channel in recent weeks, and frustrating holidaymakers who had booked for Easter and were unable to book alternative operators. The first of the two Dover-based vessels that the MCA inspected, the Pride of Kent, on 28 March, had 25 deficiencies, eight of which were serious enough to be grounds for detention. The 30-year-old, Cyprus-flagged ferry had previously been inspected in August last year, when just eight deficiencies were found. In a possible sign of the increased scrutiny of P&O, one of the deficiencies found in both inspections was the fire detection and alarm system, judged “not as required”. Last year, however, it was not deemed a ground for detention. Two failings were related to the new crew – a lack of familiarity with the machinery and a lack of training for the fire drills. The Spirit of Britain, another Dover-based ship, has also since failed an inspection but details have not yet been released. Eight P&O ferries in total will require reinspection and clearance by the MCA following the mass sackings, which the operator acknowledged breached employment law. Four remain to be inspected. A spokesperson for P&O Ferries said: “It is clear that inspections of our vessels have reached an unprecedented level of rigour. We welcome this additional scrutiny and would reiterate that the safety of our passengers and crew is our foremost priority. “Any suggestion that it is being compromised in any way is categorically false and we look forward to all of our ships welcoming tourist passengers and freight customers again as soon as all mandatory safety tests have been passed.” The safety inspections could add to the escalating costs for P&O Ferries, beyond the lost revenue from the suspension of sailings and the £36.5m compensation it has paid workers for the illegal sackings. The operator is likely to face vast increases in its insurance premiums after its ships were detained, according to sources quoted in the Daily Telegraph. A Lloyd’s of London maritime broker told the newspaper: “The costs will be sky high. P&O Ferries has gone from a very safe risk to virtually junk.”",News/Business,Record 31 failings found on P&O Ferries boat at safety inspection,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/19/record-31-failings-found-on-po-ferries-boat-at-safety-inspection
4/20/2022,"After spending four hours in a queue, Viktor Fyodorovich showed off his shiny new purchase. “I’m 63 years old. I’ve never felt so much pride before in our nation. It’s a symbol of our courage and steadfastness,” he said. Fyodorovich was the proud owner of two sheets of stamps, 16 in total. Available from Kyiv’s central post office, the stamps show a Ukrainian soldier giving the finger to the flagship Russian cruiser Moskva. On the sheet’s perforated margin is the phrase that has become a rallying slogan for Ukrainians in their underdog battle against Moscow: “Russian warship, go …!” The “fuck yourself” is tactfully omitted. The words were spoken by Roman Hrybov when the warship’s crew asked him and his fellow border guards on Snake Island, south of the port of Odesa, to surrender in the early hours of Vladimir Putin’s invasion. The phrase has since gone global. Last week the national postal service, Ukrposhta, released the design as a special commemorative stamp. “People are in love with it. It reflects the mood around the world towards Russia,” said Igor Smelyansky, Ukrposhta’s director general. Scuffles broke out when one desperate woman tried to force her way into the high-ceilinged neo-classical postal building in Kyiv’s independence square. Smelyansky came up with the idea of a stamp in the early days of the war. He asked the public for suggestions. A shortlist of 50 designs were put to a vote, with the warship the triumphant winner. “It was democratic, just like Ukraine,” he said. “Even when air raid sirens sound, people refuse to leave their place in the line.” The postal service printed a million warship stamps. Seven hundred thousand are on sale across Ukraine, Smelyansky said, with 200,000 reserved for territories currently occupied by Russian troops, including Crimea. Another 100,000 will be sold online from Thursday, he said, including to buyers abroad. For now, the only way to get hold of a sheet is to join the back of the Kyiv queue. On Tuesday it was several thousand people long. Smeylansky emerged from his office mid-morning and reassured those waiting outside that there were enough to go around – 70,000 on sale that day, limited to 16 per person. Several people asked him selfies. Others applauded and shouted “Slava Ukraini” (glory to Ukraine). Meanwhile, Smelyansky’s phone rang continuously with requests from VIPs. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, posed with the stamp and covers last week, telling his citizens on Instagram: “Everyone has to get it.” Smeylansky said he would not reprint the stamp once it sold out, despite its success. He showed off designs for a successor stamp. One featured Ukrainian police dragging away Vladimir Putin, above the words “War criminal arrested”. Another depicted a burning Kremlin and a demonic-looking Red Square. The director general pointed out wryly that the original stamp was published the day before two Ukrainian anti-ship missiles smashed into the Moskva. It sank in the Black Sea. “We should win this war. We will win it,” he said. “The Russians don’t know what they are fighting for. Their bullshit keeps changing, from denazification to freeing the Donbas.” Smelyansky has also produced a “Russian warship, go fuck yourself” T-shirt, which will soon go on general sale. He gave one to the Guardian to pass on to Boris Johnson in Downing Street, together with two sheets of stamps and a signed cover and note. It read: “Thank you UK for standing with Ukraine.” Natalii Tkachenko said she managed to buy stamps on the first day they were released. “It’s a symbol, a message. It reflects our inner patriotism,” she said, wrapping up a parcel. “I was born here. I live in this country. They want to destroy us. I’m not going to surrender. My husband is not going to surrender.” The stamp’s colourful message was appropriate, she added, since diplomacy had failed to prevent the Kremlin from starting an unprovoked and devastating war. “The stamp is a bit of a paper. But take a look at the queue. It may be small but it’s powerful. Just like Ukraine,” she said. Fyodorovich, meanwhile, said he had bought the stamps for a friend in Kharkiv, who was unable to get them himself because the city was under remorseless enemy shelling. What did he think of Russia’s president? “Putin is mad,” he said. He clarified: “No, correct that. Better to say he’s a bad worm.”",News/World news,"‘Russian warship, go …!’: Ukrainians queue for stamp celebrating act of defiance",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/19/russian-warship-go-ukrainians-queue-for-stamp-celebrating-act-of-defiance
4/20/2022,"After last week’s face-to-face meeting with the Queen, and hot foot from their weekend success at the Invictus Games, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have now reportedly been invited to appear on the Buckingham Palace balcony during the platinum jubilee. Whether Harry and Meghan will choose to take up the invitation and fly to the UK for the June celebrations is not yet known. The duke is still involved in legal action with the Home Office over security for him and his family while in the UK. However, despite the controversy over remarks by the couple critical of the royal family in interviews since stepping down as working royals, it seems the Queen, who celebrates her 96th birthday on Thursday, firmly believes family trumps all. The invitation to join other royals for the balcony appearance, which seems likely to take place at the trooping the colour birthday parade, is said to have been issued after a low-key visit to the Queen by the Sussexes during the couple’s quick stop-off at Windsor Castle en-route to the Netherlands, where the Invictus Games for wounded service personnel is held this year. The couple also had a brief meeting with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall. Harry later told the BBC “it was great’ to see his grandmother. There are unconfirmed reports he and Meghan had promised the monarch that she would meet grandchildren Archie and Lilibet “in the near future”, which suggests they may be contemplating a return for the four-day jubilee bank holiday. As non-working royals, they would play no formal role in the jubilee celebrations, but as the balcony appearance would be “a general family gathering” it seems likely this would be an ideal time for a public show of family rapprochement. “I think the ice was broken at Windsor last week, if completely or not we will never know, but at least it’s an entree” said Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty magazine. “But will he come back? Well, you kind of hope so for his grandmother’s sake.” Balcony appearances have been used previously by the royal family to signal a specific message. At the end of the diamond jubilee it was seen as symbolic that numbers were strictly limited to the Queen, Charles, Camilla, William, Kate and Harry. This was widely interpreted as a physical manifestation of Charles’s proposed “slimmed down” monarchy. That appearance came immediately after a St Paul’s service of thanksgiving, and a Westminster Hall lunch followed by a carriage procession for the most senior royals back to Buckingham Palace. This jubilee has a different format. The birthday parade would seem to be the only opportunity for a balcony appearance where, traditionally, the Queen’s extended family gather to watch the fly-past. It also seems likely it could be the last big family balcony appearance of her reign. “So, I see no reason for Harry and Meghan not to be there. The Queen has the extended family on the balcony normally, working and non-working. It’s standing room only. And, again, I see no reason for the Duke of York not to be there, as members of the extended family,” said Little. It is possible it may be the one occasion when the public sees the Queen, who has mobility issues, in person over the jubilee, with younger royals possibly standing in for her at other events. Trooping is difficult logistically. In the past, she has arrived by carriage and inspected the troops from the dais. It may be that, to aid her comfort, she remains in her carriage throughout. But it is also possible her role could be confined to watching the procession from Buckingham Palace as it returns from Horse Guards Parade ahead of the fly-past. And, though she would hope to attend the service of thanksgiving at St Paul’s, there are many steps to negotiate.",News/UK news,Sussexes invited to appear on Buckingham Palace balcony for jubilee,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/19/sussexes-invited-to-appear-on-buckingham-palace-balcony-for-jubilee
4/20/2022,"Subterranean pools of salty water may be commonplace on Jupiter’s moon, Europa, according to researchers who believe the sites could be promising spots to search for signs of life beyond Earth. Evidence for the shallow pools, not far beneath the frozen surface of the Jovian moon, emerged when scientists noticed that giant parallel ridges stretching for hundreds of miles on Europa were strikingly similar to surface features discovered on the Greenland ice sheet. If the extensive ice ridges that crisscross Europa formed in a similar way to those in Greenland, then pockets of subsurface water may be ubiquitous on the body and help circulate chemicals necessary for life from the icy shell down to the salty ocean that lurks far beneath. “Liquid water near to the surface of the ice shell is a really provocative and promising place to imagine life having a shot,” said Dustin Schroeder, an associate professor of geophysics at Stanford University. “The idea that we could find a signature that would suggest a promising pocket of water like this might exist, I think, is very exciting.” At 2,000 miles wide, Europa is slightly smaller than Earth’s moon. It became a leading contender in the search for life elsewhere when observations from ground-based telescopes and passing space probes found evidence of a deep ocean 10 to 15 miles beneath its icy surface. Europa’s ocean is estimated at 40 to 100 miles deep, so even though it is one-quarter the width of Earth, it may hold twice as much water as all of Earth’s oceans combined. For all that is known about Europa, images of the frigid body have thrown up longstanding mysteries. One is the presence of vast double ridges that cover the surface like scars. The ridges can reach up to 300 metres (1,000ft) high and are separated by valleys half a mile wide. The Stanford team’s insight was sparked by an academic presentation about Europa that mentioned the curious double ridges. Pictures of the features reminded the scientists of a much smaller double ridge they had noticed in north-west Greenland. Armed with radar and other observations of the Greenland ridges, they set about understanding how they formed. “On the Greenland ice sheet there is this little double ridge feature that looks almost exactly like the ones we see on the surface of Jupiter’s moon Europa,” said Riley Culberg, a PhD candidate and geophysicist at Stanford. “And the reason it’s exciting to have this analogue feature in Greenland is that we’ve been trying to figure out what makes double ridges on Europa for about 20 years.” Writing in Nature Communications, the researchers describe how Greenland’s double ice ridges, which are about 50 times smaller than those on Europa, formed when shallow pools of subsurface water froze and fractured the surface time and time again, steadily driving up the twin ridges. “It’s like when you put a can of soda in the freezer and it explodes. It’s that kind of pressure that pushes up the ridges on the surface,” said Culberg. In Greenland, water drains into the underground pockets from surface lakes, but on Europa the scientists suspect liquid water is forced up towards the surface from the underlying ocean through fractures in the ice shell. This movement of water could help circulate chemicals necessary for life down into Europa’s ocean, they add. Michael Manga, a professor of earth and planetary science at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not involved in the research, said it was “plausible” for Europa’s ridges to form by water being squeezed upwards. But questions remain. “I do wonder why the features are so much smaller on Earth,” he said. While Earth’s stronger gravity could explain why the ridges are lower here than on Europa, it is unclear why the valleys between them are narrower too. Nasa’s Europa Clipper mission, due to launch in 2024, is expected to shed light on how the double ridges formed when it performs detailed reconnaissance of Jupiter’s moon and investigates whether it harbours conditions suitable for life.",News/Science,"Jupiter’s moon Europa may have water where life could exist, say scientists",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/19/jupiters-moon-europa-may-have-water-life-could-exist

4/20/2022,"Better Call Saul has never been a show to hurry things. Since it began in 2015, it has refused to progress at anything more than a steady simmer, slowly slotting together a set of circumstances with enough care to make whatever happens feel inevitable. This is the way it has to be. If you’ve seen Breaking Bad – and, at a conservative estimate, 100% of Better Call Saul’s audience has seen Breaking Bad – then you have known for almost a decade where the story is going to end. At some point, the endearing lawyer Jimmy McGill will succumb entirely to the dark charms of Saul Goodman, get in over his head with Walter White and run away to manage a Cinnabon in Nebraska under an assumed identity. With Better Call Saul, the destination was never the most interesting part. It’s how we get there that matters. And so co-showrunner Peter Gould has spent years delighting in how slowly he can tell Jimmy’s story. Fragments of Saul have been fed into Jimmy’s world at a punishingly incremental pace. In one notorious early episode, a character painstakingly disassembles a car component by component until, at the very last moment, he finds something microscopic he’s been searching for. It’s as good a metaphor for the show as you’re ever going to find. But we’re in the homestretch now. This is Better Call Saul’s final season, and it has just 13 episodes to bridge the gap to Breaking Bad. The premiere’s cold open made it perfectly clear how much ground we have left to cover. The sequence – one of the show’s most masterful, which is really saying something – slowly drifted around Goodman’s abandoned home as the FBI stripped it bare. And it’s unrecognisable. It’s a mansion, Trumpian in its lack of taste, filled with marble and statues and the most presposterous golden toilet in the history of television. Bottles of Viagra line the bathroom. A neon G-string is lifted from a bath. At the time of the FBI raid, it seems as if the place was inhabited by Saul Goodman in full two-dimensional flight. Believe the sequence and, by this point, all trace of Jimmy McGill has been extinguished. The final season begins with a two-parter, and neither of those episodes seems particularly keen on joining the dots. That leaves us with 11 episodes to get from here to there. And the Jimmy to Saul story is just a fragment of what Better Call Saul is at this point. The show has become an entire tapestry. Gus Fring, Mike Ehrmantraut, Lalo Salamanca, Nacho Varga and Howard Hamlin all have stories that need to be resolved. We’re still no closer to learning what happens to Kim Wexler, who remains forebodingly absent from Breaking Bad. And there are now just 11 episodes to wrap all of this up. For the life of me, I have absolutely no idea how it’s going to happen. But this is why we watch Better Call Saul. No other show on television has the same ability to get under your skin. If we didn’t care about these characters, this deliberately slow development would be tedious. But we do care about them, with almost no exceptions. Everyone wants Kim to get out in one piece. But Lalo, whose swashbuckling first appearance in season four supercharged the entire series, has become such an engaging presence that I’m now anticipating his fate with a similar level of dread. It’s even more painful for the characters we were already familiar with, because we know what happens to them, and none of it is good. Jimmy loses his humanity and turns into Saul. Mike dies. Even Francesca, Saul’s receptionist, ends up drained of her will to live. At this point, I really don’t want the gap to be bridged. I like these people, and I desperately want to cling on to them for as long as I can before gravity takes hold and they slip away towards their awful conclusions. Eleven hours. That’s all we have left in this world. I’ve mentioned before that I prefer Better Call Saul to Breaking Bad. It’s more human, more willing to linger on the decency of people. But 11 hours from now, it’s going to be lost for ever. When Vince Gilligan created Breaking Bad, he consciously made a show about metastasis. That has continued to Better Call Saul. And now that the prognosis is terminal, I’m already heartbroken.",Arts/Television & radio,11 hours to get to Breaking Bad?

4/20/2022,"Easter historically marks the point on the calendar where things in the world of football begin to sort themselves out, the effective start of the Business End of the season, and this year has been no different. Derby County’s relegation to the third tier for the first time since 1984 was confirmed on Monday. Burnley look nailed on to be heading in that direction too, if the sacking of Sean Dyche, Maxwell Cornet’s radar, and the state of that takeover are anything to go by. And the immediate future of a couple of other clubs could be shaped on Tuesday as well, depending on what happens at Anfield between Liverpool and Manchester United. You may as well watch it, there’s nowt else on. United’s last visit to Merseyside was a fiasco for the ages, a post-lunch walkabout at Goodison Park in which they achieved what had previously been thought impossible by making a Frank Lampard team look vaguely tactically coherent. They surely can’t be as bad this time, though even worse is as likely an outcome as better, if the lumpen attempt to paper over the cracks with Saturday’s scraped victory over Norwich, who were allowed to score two goals for only the sixth time this season, is anything to go by. Still, hope springs eternal, and a surprise win would boost their hopes of a top-four finish, which are somehow still alive, what an indictment of the self-styled best league in the world. Defeat for the side nominally led by Ralf Rangnick would surely put an end to their Big Cup pipe dreams, though on the plus side it would allow their fans to keep shouting at Paul Pogba, which everyone seems to enjoy doing.

4/20/2022,"On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert started by reminding everyone what the day represented for Americans. “Today was also tax day or as Jeff Bezos calls it, no it’s not,” he joked. The midterms are seven months away and “culture wars are raging” especially in Florida, which he referred to as “America’s mullet”. Colbert said it was a state obsessed with “withholding knowledge from children” and ensuring they don’t feel any personal responsibility for historic wrongs. “It’s really hard to tell the story of America without talking about historic wrongs,” he noted. The state rejected 41% of new math textbooks for containing what they claim to be Critical Race Theory language or “at least they think it’s 41%, for some reason they suck at math”. There is a refusal to provide any examples but the process is being described as transparent. “I guess they also banned dictionaries because that’s not what transparent means,” he said. Next up was Tucker Carlson and Colbert said that he was “hesitant to talk about Tucker because he does or says things that are kind of stupid for attention but this one is so stupid that it got my attention”. His new documentary is about the “de-broing of America” and so the trailer featured a montage of sweaty muscular shirtless men. “Coming from a Fox News anchor, that is a refreshing and positive display of homoeroticism,” he said. The most-ridiculed section has a man using a tanning device for his testicles. “Is that man scanning his penis at the self-checkout?” he asked. Colbert found it surprising that Carlson was into the idea of testicle tanning as “the last time I checked, he is the whitest dick ever”. The logic around Florida’s CRT math textbook ban just doesn't hold up pic.twitter.com/NBd2NHODaJ On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah also spoke about Florida’s strange textbook crisis. “If they were trying to sneak CRT into schools, why would they lead with math?” he asked. “Math textbooks would be the worst place to do it because who remembers anything they learned in math, huh? Do you remember how to use a hypotenuse?” He continued: “Even Liam Neeson, his particular set of skills did not include a hypotenuse.” But Noah also realised that perhaps it could be a good place for critical race theory. “I actually wish there was CRT in math textbooks because then we would have solved racism by now just by cheating and going to the back of the book with all the answers in it,” he joked. On Late Night with Seth Meyers, he also spoke about Carlson’s unhinged new doc about testosterone. In an interview with a testicle tanning expert, Carlson said that about half of his viewers would be shocked by the idea. But Meyers countered and said if you watched a Carlson-fronted show then “you might be down to clown with just about anything”. In the same show, Carlson’s object of affection Kid Rock was less sure about the idea. Meyers called it an idea “so insane even Kid Rock couldn’t wrap his head around it”. He continued: “Is it already time to resort to tanning your balls? Nothing is crazier than a conservative’s second idea. I don’t trust vaccines but I’ll eat some horse paste. Are there ever solutions somewhere between plan ‘a’ and the craziest shit you’ve ever heard?” Meyers said of Carlson and Trump, who recently went on another rant against windmills, that: “These are the people leading the conservative movement in the Republican party”. This week has also revealed that Utah senator Mike Lee and Donald Trump Jr were in text contact with the White House on ways to overturn the election results. Meyers joked that Don Jr’s texts made him “sound like the bad guy in a Jean Claude Van Damme movie”.",Arts/Culture,Colbert on Tucker Carlson’s end-of-men film: ‘A refreshing display of homoeroticism’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/19/colbert-tucker-carlson-end-of-men-film-homoeroticism
4/20/2022,"The New York Times has named Joseph Kahn as its new executive editor, the paper’s top editorial job. Kahn will replace Dean Baquet, the New York Times’s first Black executive editor, who has led the paper since 2014 but who hit the company’s mandatory retirement age, 65, this year. “Joe brings impeccable news judgment, a sophisticated understanding of the forces shaping the world and a long track record of helping journalists produce their most ambitious and courageous work,” said the Times’s publisher, AG Sulzberger. Kahn’s promotion was reported to be widely expected. After joining the paper in 1998, and having worked as a China correspondent, Kahn led the international news desk before being tapped as managing editor, the second-highest ranking position. Kahn, 57, has also worked at the Wall Street Journal and Dallas Morning News, where he shared in a Pulitzer prize for reporting on violence against women. Baquet has dealt with a number of challenges. In late 2020, the New York Times podcast Caliphate was roundly criticized after an internal review found that an important source was probably fabricating his experiences. The paper also faced criticism for a lack of diversity, facing a 2016 lawsuit in which two employees alleged a workplace environment “rife with discrimination based on age, race, and gender”. In a diversity report conducted in 2021, people of color said they faced “unsettling and sometimes painful day-to-day workplace experiences”. Baquet will take a new position that will be announced soon, the New York Times said. His term as executive editor is expected to conclude in June. “It has been my great honor to lead the best newsroom in the world for the past eight years,” Baquet said in a statement. “I would like to thank the Sulzberger family for their continued dedication to protecting our country’s most powerful engine of independent, investigative journalism.”",News/Media,New York Times names Joseph Kahn as executive editor ,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/19/new-york-times-names-joseph-kahn-as-executive-editor
4/20/2022,"British Cycling’s safeguarding team has reached out to Bradley Wiggins following the Tour de France winner’s “deeply concerning” allegations that he was sexually groomed by his coach when he was 13. The sport’s governing body also confirmed it had offered Wiggins its full support after he revealed in an interview that he had “buried” what happened to him because he had no one to turn to for help. “We are deeply concerned by the matter raised by Sir Bradley Wiggins and our safeguarding team has made contact with him today to offer our full support,” a British Cycling spokesperson said. “We would encourage anybody who has suffered abuse or has concerns about the welfare of others – regardless of when the incident took place – to utilise the support offered both by our trained team at British Cycling and the dedicated NSPCC Helpline, which in turn helps us to ensure that our sport is a safe and welcoming place for all.” Wiggins, who won the 2012 Tour de France and won eight Olympic medals during his career, told Men’s Health UK that he had been groomed when he was about 13 and “I never fully accepted that”. Asked if he was groomed sexually, Wiggins added: “Yes. It all impacted me as an adult … I buried it.” Wiggins said that he had been unable to speak to his stepfather as he beat him: “My stepfather was quite violent to me, he used to call me a faggot for wearing Lycra and stuff, so I didn’t think I could tell him.” The 41-year-old was also praised by the NSPCC for being brave enough to come forward. Michelle North, head of the charity’s child protection in sport unit, said: “It takes a lot of courage to speak out about sexual abuse and Sir Bradley Wiggins has shown real bravery in revealing how he was groomed as a young cyclist by his coach who should have been protecting him. “Sports coaches hold a great deal of power and influence over the children in their care and can all too easily exploit this trust to groom and abuse them. “It’s common for victims to feel guilt and shame or to even be unaware that they are being abused and some may not come to accept it until decades later but nonetheless the impact can be devastating and long lasting.”  In the UK, the NSPCC offers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

4/20/2022,"Achoir of joyful, experimental, virtuosic Black female voices greets visitors to the British pavilion at the 59th Venice Biennale, the world’s most prominent international art event – delayed a year by the Covid pandemic. Sonia Boyce, 60, the artist who is representing Britain at the Biennale, invited four Black singers of different generations – jazz singer Jacqui Dankworth, singer-songwriter Tanita Tikaram, blues-influenced artist Poppy Ajudha and experimental vocalist Sofia Jernberg – to improvise, at first together under the direction of the composer Errollyn Wallen, then alone. The resulting videos of the singers play out in an immersive, bright environment full of colourful “wallpaper” and golden embellishment. Boyce also shows items from her Devotional project, an ever-expanding archive begun in 1999, of vinyl, CDs and memorabilia of an often hidden history of Black female musicianship. It is, she said, “a collective attempt against amnesia”. As is characteristic for Boyce, who often collaborates with others, she did not direct or instruct the musicians or her film crew after she brought them together. Rather, during the daylong session at Abbey Road Studios, she allowed them to “play”. “One of my most abiding memories of the day was watching Tanita Tikaram improvising five different songs on the spot,” said the artist. For me that is the answer to why the Devotional project might be important. There is all this incredible, skilful knowledge in these performers who, by being reduced to being ‘female’ or ‘Black’ – if we only focus on that – we can miss what they can do. Even when we are actually surrounded by it.” The statement may be a warning to remember that Boyce, whose long career began when she was associated with the Blk Art Group in the early 1980s, is not to be reduced to being the first Black woman to occupy the British pavilion at the Venice Biennale – or to being the first Black British woman elected a Royal Academician, or to being the first Black British woman to have a painting collected by Tate, in 1987. Nevertheless, occupying a national pavilion at an art event that is unusually embroiled in the geopolitics of the moment – playing out as it does in pavilions devoted to individual countries – is an unusually freighted experience for any artist. Just down the wide avenue from the British pavilion in Venice’s Giardini, one of the two main venues for the Biennale, is the Russian pavilion. The Lithuanian curator of Russia’s project, as well as its artists, resigned shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the art nouveau Russian pavilion is lying empty, conspicuously patrolled on Tuesday morning by an armed guard. Like embassies, each national pavilion is officially the property of its own country. By contrast, the Ukrainian pavilion, featuring artist Pavlo Makov – who managed to make it out of Kharkiv and to Venice along with his team – will be very much present, with all eyes too on a last-minute exhibition in the Giardini, titled Piazza Ucraina and staged in solidarity with the country. On what she referred to as “the burden of representation” in her occupation of the British pavilion this year, Boyce said, “I cannot represent all the Black artists in Britain, and all the female artists, and I wouldn’t want even to suggest I was doing that.” She added, “I was born in London in 1962 and lived all my life in the UK, and I am artist. That says it all … This is not a flag-waving scenario. Most artists see this as an opportunity to be part of a global dialogue with a lot of joyous and global conversations taking place.” Aside from 80 national pavilions, each Biennale, which runs from Saturday until 27 November, features a large central exhibition organised by an invited curator, this year Cecilia Alemani, chief curator of New York’s High Line. Occupying the large International pavilion in the Giardini, and the huge acreage of the city’s former naval Arsenale, Alemani’s show is titled The Milk of Dreams, after a children’s story by the British surrealist artist and author Leonora Carrington. Of the 213 artists from 58 countries in Alemani’s exhibition, most of them, for the first time in the Biennale’s history, are women. Alemani said she was aiming to de-centre the post-Renaissance idea of the male human as the dominant artistic viewpoint. Indeed, in the International pavilion work only by women, as well as by a scattering of non-binary and trans artists, is on show. Full of metamorphosing bodies, animals and technological fantasies, the exhibition begins with German artist Katharina Fritsch’s hyperreal sculpture of an elephant atop a pedestal and – a last-minute inclusion – a gouache of fantastical creature by the 20th century Ukrainian artist Maria Prymachenko, a museum of whose work was bombarded in February. With a wide range of new and contemporary work, including an entire room of paintings by Paula Rego, a Covid “diary” in drawings on the back of medicine packets by Sudanese-born Ibrahim El-Salahi, and a beautiful, disturbing film work by British-born artist P Staff, Alemani’s exhibition also contains “time capsules” of work by historical artists, with an emphasis on female surrealists such as Ithell Colquhoun and Dorothea Tanning. The Venice Biennale was founded in 1895 as a single international art exhibition in the Giardini. In the years that followed, national pavilions were erected in the gardens to showcase art from different countries. Always highly politicised, the Biennale was the scene of a meeting between Hitler and Mussolini in 1934. The Russian pavilion was built in 1914 by Alexey Shchusev, a great survivor who later designed Lenin’s mausoleum.",Arts/Art and design,Venice Biennale kicks off with brightness and joy amid global tensions,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/19/venice-biennale-kicks-off-with-joy-and-colour-amid-global-tensions
4/20/2022,"MPs will vote on Thursday on whether to refer Boris Johnson for a formal parliamentary investigation into whether or not he misled them about his knowledge of Covid law-breaking parties. Lindsay Hoyle, the House of Commons Speaker, granted a request by Labour for the matter to be examined given the prime minister insisted repeatedly that no rules were broken in Downing Street during lockdown, but was later issued with a fine by police for attending a birthday party. The ministerial code, which bears Johnson’s signature, says the punishment for misleading parliament is resignation. But since the prime minister is the only person who can enforce the code and he has resisted calls to stand down, the fresh investigation would pile further pressure on him. Labour and the Liberal Democrats had requested for Hoyle to grant a debate and vote on referring the row to the privileges committee, a cross-party group of seven MPs with a Conservative majority but chaired by the Labour MP Chris Bryant. Hoyle said: “It is not for me to determine whether or not the prime minister has committed a contempt. My role is to decide if there is an arguable case to be examined. “Having considered the issue, having taken advice from the clerks of the house, I’ve decided that this is a matter that I should allow the precedence accorded to the issue of privilege.” The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, will table a motion on Wednesday to be discussed and voted on the following day, which will call for the privileges committee to look into whether the prime minister misled parliament. Johnson is meant to be on a trip to India, so will miss the vote and avoid having to defend himself in the chamber. Downing Street and the Conservative whips’ office may heavily whip their MPs to oppose the move, telling them it will be treated like a confidence vote in Johnson and that any rebels will be thrown out of the parliamentary party. But being forced to show their hand will place those Conservative backbenchers who have so far remained silent about their position on Johnson’s law-breaking in a difficult position. Opposition parties have already begun crafting digital adverts targeting constituents whose Tory MPs will vote against the motion, to hammer them in the run-up to next month’s local elections. Tory MPs were urged by the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, to “do their patriotic duty” and kick Johnson out of Downing Street. He said: “The British public have declared Boris Johnson a liar. Now it’s time for parliament to do the same. The country cannot afford a prime minister who breaks the law and lies about it, especially when families are facing a cost of living crisis. “Johnson has taken the British people for fools for far too long, and it’s time for Conservative MPs to show where they stand.” In the event that MPs do vote for an investigation, the privileges committee will be able to call for papers, summon witnesses and recommend a sanction – such as suspension or expulsion.",News/Politics,Partygate: MPs to vote on whether Boris Johnson should be investigated for misleading parliament,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/19/partygate-boris-johnson-mps-vote-misleading-parliament
4/20/2022,"There have been few racehorse owners in recent decades who showed as much loyalty to their trainers as the late Sheikh Hamdan al-Maktoum, who died in March 2021. From his earliest days in the sport in the 1980s, being chosen to train for the Sheikh’s Shadwell Stud operation was pretty much a guarantee that more – often many more – impeccably bred horses would follow. While Sheikh Mohammed, his younger brother, famously sent a fleet of horse boxes to remove his entire string from Henry Cecil’s stable one morning, Sheikh Hamdan was characterised by his decision to buy a yard in Lambourn for Dick Hern in the mid-80s, after he was forced to quit the Queen’s stables at West Ilsley. So it came as a bit of a jolt to hear confirmation over the weekend that several high-profile and very successful trainers have been cut from the Shadwell list, following a decision by Sheikha Hissa, the late owner’s daughter, to slim down the operation. Sir Michael Stoute, the 10-time champion trainer, will no longer have any horses to run in the famous blue and white silks. Mark and Charlie Johnston, Ed Dunlop and Brian Meehan have also been dropped from the roster, along with Dermot Weld and Freddy Head in Ireland and France respectively. The colours which were carried with such distinction by horses like Nashwan, Salsabil, Dayjur, Battaash and Taghrooda are not about to disappear from our tracks overnight, but a fresh direction of travel has been set. Shadwell announced plans to sell a “substantial” number of horses last September and while there were 630 runners in the blue and white in Britain in 2021, the total seems certain to fall well short of that this year. Shadwell was also conspicuously absent from the high-profile Book 1 Sale at Tattersalls last year, at the end of a campaign on the track when their total number of runs from juveniles was below 200 for the first time in a decade, and the final tally of 160 was a drop of 38 from the number for 2012. There is an inescapable sense here of gradual decline: carefully managed, perhaps, but decline all the same. And it is also impossible to ignore the fact that a significant number of the individuals whose colours have defined Flat racing for the last 40 years are now in their 70s, at least. The silks of the leading owners are racing’s version of radio-carbon dating. Long-standing fans of the Flat could probably look through the colours on the runners in any Derby in the last half-century and guess, to within a year or two, when it was run. From the early 70s onwards, traditional owner-breeders like Lord Howard de Walden and Lord Weinstock were replaced by Robert Sangster, the Aga Khan, Sheikh Hamdan, Khalid Abdullah and Fahd Salman. They all left their mark before the various silks of the Coolmore syndicate and then the royal blue of Godolphin started to dominate the fields.

4/20/2022,"The supreme court has allowed the US Department of Defense to take disciplinary action against an air force lieutenant colonel who refuses to get a Covid-19 vaccine. In a brief, two-sentence ruling on Monday, a majority of the court sided with the Pentagon. Three justices in the conservative majority – Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch – dissented. The ruling was merely the court’s latest on challenges to Covid-19 vaccine mandates. In January, the court blocked a Biden administration requirement that employees of large businesses be vaccinated and wear masks on the job. The court ruled in March that the US navy had the authority to determine the job assignments of 35 service members who refused to get vaccinated. The case in question on Monday involved Lt Col Jonathan Dunn, previously commander of a 40-member squadron in California, according to court documents filed by the US solicitor general, Elizabeth Prelogar. Prelogar argued that while Dunn cited religious grounds for his refusal to get vaccinated, he did not “assert that the Covid-19 vaccine or compulsory vaccination in general is inconsistent with his Christian faith”, noting that he has received other vaccinations without objection. Dunn instead cited a speech given by Joe Biden that led him to conclude that “the vaccine ceased to be merely a medical invention and took on a symbolic and even sacramental quality”. His religion, he said, forbade him from participating in such “religious ritual”. Upon denial of his exemption request, Dunn sent to a major general “a one-word memorandum that simply read: ‘NUTS!’”. Prelogar noted that while Dunn maintains he meant no disrespect, “NUTS!” has a “well-known ‘military historical connotation’”. She cited the case of Anthony McAuliffe, a key US military officer in the second world war who responded to a German message requesting American surrender with the one-worded answer. The American officer who delivered McAuliffe’s message to German officers clarified that, “If you don’t understand what ‘nuts’ means, in plain English, it is the same as ‘Go to hell.’” The court documents say that the air force took disciplinary action against Dunn, including his removal from command and non-punitive disciplinary measures, citing his commanding officer who said he had “lost trust in [Dunn’s] leadership and judgment” due to the memorandum and that he displayed a “pattern of a lack of respect for military authority”. Prelogar said that Dunn’s actions independent of his refusal to be vaccinated warranted the measures against him. The US solicitor general also said that Dunn’s unit has to be ready to be deployed anywhere in the world with as little as three days’ notice, including countries that require proof of vaccination for entry. Prelogar also noted that the military has a long history of requiring vaccinations and currently requires nine vaccinations for service members. The deadline for air force members to get vaccinated was 2 November. In December, an air force spokesperson told NBC News that the military branch discharged 27 active-duty members who refused to get the vaccination and were not exempted. The US military that same month said 97% of its service members had received the Covid-19 vaccine.",News/Law,US supreme court rules against air force officer who refused Covid vaccine ,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/apr/19/us-supreme-court-air-force-officer-covid-vaccine
4/20/2022,"Until I reached 16, I’d spent my entire education in mixed schools. A lot of that time was happy: I made friends, learned new skills and explored subjects that intrigued me. But all of those experiences happened under a shadow of misogyny – one that was fuelled by a culture of unwanted sexual advances, rape jokes and crude comments about the appearance of female teachers and fellow students that was allowed to exist in classrooms, completely unchecked by staff. I remember one geography class, where a young trainee was observing our lesson. As she walked around the room looking at everyone’s work, a group of boys waited until she was out of earshot to snigger about her behind. “Yeah, she’s got a phat back, you know,” they laughed. Teachers are naturally in a position of authority, leadership and safeguarding. But when boys began to objectify and sexualise teachers – not only elbow-nudging, gesturing and giggling behind their backs but approaching teachers to ask things like “Are you single, miss?” before running off – it felt like the boys had the power rather than the teachers. The very people who were there to protect us were no longer safe themselves. Slowly, it became apparent to me that the things I was witnessing on a daily basis weren’t isolated events but rather belonged to a very sinister culture. At the beginning of high school, things had been different. Everyone was new to each other, and the “banter” among the boys was mostly restricted to football and Fifa, beyond the occasional “make me a sandwich” or “kitchen slave”. However, as we got older, rape jokes began to creep into conversations and were met with peals of laughter from other boys. No class was safe. In business studies, we watched clips from The Apprentice, and each time a female contestant came on screen, boys would make phallic gestures or explicit comments. Even something as simple as an advert featuring a woman was viewed through this tainted, hypersexual lens. Eventually, my patience ran out and I asked: “Why are you so sexist?” The angry shouts of “HOW AM I SEXIST, TELL ME, HOW?” that came in response made me immediately regret my decision. I could feel the stares boring into the back of my head. And even though I knew I was in the right, I couldn’t help but feel embarrassed. Other girls who challenged their peers about victim-blaming rape survivors during consent lessons faced the same response. This left me feeling hopeless – the lessons had been introduced after a pair of boys were reported for coercing girls for nude photographs and posting them on social media. We were at the end of our GCSE course and preparing to leave school in a few weeks’ time, and yet this was how these conversations were ending – with fury, disagreement and two boys being sent to isolation for their comments about rape. As the end of high school approached and the time to apply for colleges and sixth forms came around, I didn’t just apply for the most popular colleges – I also tried my luck at a local all-girls schools, mainly because of its formidable reputation and academic rigour. Soon after my applications, I began to receive offers, yet I remained unsure of where to go. The option of going to an all-girls school felt like the safest one, but not a single one of my friends had applied there, so I would be starting off very much alone. However, near the end of the academic year, when the fallout of Sarah Everard’s murder and the tsunami of testimonies flooding into the Everyone’s Invited website hit the news, my decision to go to an all-girls school was cemented.

4/20/2022,"Made last year but suddenly obliquely relevant after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, this Estonian-British co-production examines some of the ways a repressive and homophobic state apparatus scars citizens with shame. Based on a true story according to the opening credits, the setting is the late 1970s when the Soviet Union still occupied the Baltic nations. Provincial Russian youth Sergey Serebrennikov (played by British actor Tom Prior, also one of the screenplay’s co-authors, along with Estonian director Peeter Rebane and story originator Sergey Fetisov) is doing his national service at an army base in Estonia. He has a coy flirtation going with local beauty Luisa (Diana Pozharskaya), a secretary on the base for a commanding officer, and he is pally with his bunk mate Volodja (Jake Henderson). However, when Sergey is assigned to serve as a sort of valet to suave ace fighter pilot Roman Matvajev (Ukrainian actor Oleg Zagorodnii), the attraction between the two men turns physical and they’re soon making out to Tchaikovsky records and sneaking off to Tallinn to watch a performance of Igor Stravinsky’s Firebird, hence the film’s name. Alas, this was a time when homosexuality was outlawed in the Soviet military – though the current situation is not much better – and an anonymous source tips off the local KGB officer, meaning that Sergey and Roman have to hide their love away. Sergey’s service comes to an end, and he moves to Moscow to train to become an actor, finding a more bohemian circle that lets him keep the closet door ajar if not fully open. A few years go by and in classic melodrama fashion, Roman shows up again, just unable to quit Sergey (as they say in Brokeback Mountain), even though he has married and fathered a son in the meantime. Ultimately, it’s a rather sad story, not unlike Brokeback given the period setting and closeted-love theme. But director Rebane, though competent enough, is no Ang Lee. Prior and Zagorodnii certainly have romantic chemistry, but the dialogue is often more than a little stiff and there’s something weirdly off about movies where characters speak English with one another instead of the language the characters are supposed to be speaking in, in this case Russian. You can see why the film-makers chose to do it this way, but it makes the film feel old-fashioned and clunky. That’s a shame because the film’s exploration of love, courage and the price of speaking your truth is as timely as it’s ever been, and for Russians particularly.

4/20/2022,"An attempt to bar the far-right Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene from Congress over her support for the January 6 attack can proceed, a federal judge said. Citing “a whirlpool of colliding constitutional interests of public import”, Amy Totenberg of the northern district of Georgia sent the case on to a state hearing on Friday. A coalition of liberal groups is behind the challenge, citing the 14th amendment to the US constitution, passed after the civil war. The amendment says: “No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any state, who, having previously taken an oath … to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.” Supporters of Donald Trump attacked the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, seeking to stop certification of his defeat by Joe Biden. A bipartisan Senate committee connected seven deaths to the riot. About 800 people have been charged, some with seditious conspiracy. Trump was impeached for inciting an insurrection. Acquitted, he is free to run again. Organisers of events in Washington on January 6 have tied Greene to their efforts. Greene has denied such links and said she does not encourage violence. In October, however, she told a radio show: “January 6 was just a riot at the Capitol and if you think about what our Declaration of Independence says, it says to overthrow tyrants.” In the immediate aftermath of the Capitol attack, Greene was one of 147 Republicans in Congress who objected to results in battleground states, an effort inspired by Trump’s lies about electoral fraud. An effort to use the 14th amendment against Madison Cawthorn, an extremist from North Carolina, was unsuccessful, after a judge ruled an 1872 civil war amnesty law was not merely retroactive. In her ruling on Greene’s attempt to dismiss her challenge, on Monday, Totenberg said: “This case involves a whirlpool of colliding constitutional interests of public import. Upon a thorough analysis of each of the claims asserted in this case, the court concludes that [Greene] has not carried her burden of persuasion.” Even if a state judge rules against Greene, she could challenge the ruling. The Georgia primary is on 25 May, cutting time short. Greene seems likely to win re-election. Writing for the Guardian this month, the Georgetown University professor Thomas Zimmer said: “Greene’s position within the Republican party seems secure … in fact, Greene is the poster child of a rising group of rightwing radicals … [not] shy about their intention to purge whatever vestiges of ‘moderate’ conservatism might still exist within the Republican party.” One of the groups behind the challenge to Greene is Free Speech for the People. In January, the group’s legal director, Ron Fein, told the Guardian the group aimed to set “a line that says that just as the framers of the 14th amendment wrote and intended, you can’t take an oath to support the constitution and then facilitate an insurrection against the United States while expecting to pursue public office”. On Monday, Fein said: “We look forward to asking Representative Greene about her involvement [in January 6] under oath.” Mike Rasbury, an activist with the Bernie Sanders-affiliated Our Revolution group and a plaintiff in the lawsuit against Greene, said he was “elated” by Totenberg’s ruling. Greene, Rasbury said, “took an oath of office to protect democracy from all enemies foreign and domestic, just as I did when I became a helicopter pilot for the US army in Vietnam. However, she has flippantly ignored this oath and, based on her role in the January 6 insurrection, is disqualified … from holding any future public office”.",News/US news,"Attempt to bar Marjorie Taylor Greene from Congress can proceed, judge says",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/19/marjorie-taylor-green-republican-congress-judge-14th-amendment-challenge-georgia
4/20/2022,"Authorities in Venice are pushing ahead with a plan to charge day-trippers up to €10 (£8.30) to enter the lagoon city as they scramble to gain control of tourism after visitor numbers hit pre-pandemic levels over the Easter weekend. The booking system will begin in June with a six-month pilot before potentially taking full effect in January next year. Luigi Brugnaro, the mayor of Venice, said the city was “the first in the world” to conduct “this difficult experiment”. Plans for an entrance fee have been in the pipeline since the measure was approved by the Italian government in late 2018 as a solution to mass tourism in a city which, before the coronavirus pandemic, attracted an estimated 30 million people a year. That figure was demolished by the pandemic, and although visitors have returned, the Easter weekend was the first real sign of the tourism sector bouncing back as more than 125,000 people filled Venice’s squares and alleyways. “Tourism in Venice is starting again, and is a breath of fresh air for [tourism] operators,” Brugnaro tweeted. “Today, many have understood that the booking system is the right path to take for a more balanced management of tourism.” The measure will apply to day-trippers, who will need to book ahead and pay between €3 and €10, depending on how busy the city is on the day they want to visit. “The experimental phase begins in June, when day tourists will be invited to book through a website that is being completed by the council,” Simone Venturini, Venice’s tourism councillor, told La Repubblica. “Those who book will receive incentives, such as discounts on entering museums. To determine the access fee, we will set a maximum threshold of 40,000 or 50,000 visitors a day.” People living in the Veneto region will be required to book too even though they are exempt from paying the fee, while a list of other exemptions, for example needing to come to the city for a funeral or to visit a relative, will be announced over the next few weeks. Those who stay overnight will be exempt as they already pay a tourist tax. The plan could eventually include the installation of gates at key arrival points in the city. Venice is preparing for another busy period this weekend, with the inauguration of the Biennale, the world’s oldest and largest arts festival, and a national holiday on Monday.",News/World news,Venice pushes ahead with €10 entry fee plan as tourists flock back,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/19/venice-day-trippers-to-be-charged-up-to-10-to-enter-city
4/20/2022,"Russian forces have seized the city of Kreminna in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region and Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from the city, the regional governor has said. Kreminna, a city of more than 18,000 people about 350 miles (560km) south-east of the capital, Kyiv, appears to be the first city captured in a Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine. Russia has again called on Ukrainian forces encamped in the Azovstal metallurgical plant in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol to lay down their arms. Ukrainian authorities say that no fewer than 1,000 civilians are hiding in the complex along with Ukrainian fighters. Drone footage released on Monday 19 April shows a large plume of smoke rising from the Azovstal steel plant, the main remaining Ukrainian stronghold in Mariupol: Under Russian control Russian invasion route Russian airstrike or shelling Russian attack or movement Ukrainian attack or movement  The world becomes increasingly concerned about more than 100,000 Russian troops that have accumulated on the Ukrainian border. Western intelligence agencies sound the alarm, though Vladimir Putin insists Russia has no plans to invade. On 22 February, Putin declared that Russia would recognise the Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent states, after Russia-backed separatists partially seized the regions. Ukraine and the west's worst fears are realised as airstrikes hit targets across the country, as far west as Lviv. By clicking on the dots on the map, you'll reveal more information about individual strikes and events. Russian forces invade Ukraine from multiple entry points: Belarus to the north, Russia to the east and Russian-occupied Crimea to the south. Russian forces move on several points on the first day of the invasion. Several key locations, including the Chernobyl exclusion zone, are captured by the Russian army. Russian troops enter parts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where they face strong resistance. After fierce fighting prevents them from seizing the Hostomel airbase on the first day of the invasion, progress is limited to the north-west of the capital. They are still, however, able to claim some land on the outskirts of the city. Elsewhere, fighting continues even as Russian progress slows. Russian forces move to encircle the southern city of Mariupol, although they enjoy less success in the north, where they abandon an attempt to take Chernihiv after heavy fighting. Russian forces advance on key cities including Kharkiv in the north-east, Kyiv in the north and Mariupol in the south. A large convoy of military vehicles approaches the capital, although progress is limited and logistical problems are reported. As the war enters its second week, Russia steps up shelling of civilian areas. Operations to envelop Kyiv remain the focus of Russia’s efforts, but the ISW reports three other aims: seizing Kharkiv, taking Mariupol and securing a “land bridge” in the south, and securing Kherson in order to set conditions for a drive west towards Mykolaiv and Odesa. Little progress is made over the first two weeks of March. Amid reports of lost momentum and low morale, Russian forces are consolidating positions with reinforcements and probing defences around Kyiv. Dozens of civilians are reportedly killed as Russian forces hit cities with artillery and airstrikes, seen as a new tactic in the face of limited advances on the ground. Russia is widely seen as making its best advances in the south, where Kherson becomes the first major city to fall under Russian control. On the other southern front, several buildings in Mariupol are flattened and people are left without water or power. Russia breaks ceasefires put in place to allow for evacuations from Mariupol and Volnovakha. As the conflict concludes its third week, Russia sends in reinforcements to tighten its grip around the key cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, which remain under Ukrainian control. Russian advances in the south contrast with difficulties its forces have faced in the north and north-east. Nowhere is this resistance stronger than in the increasingly fortified capital, Kyiv. Russia steps up its artillery and airstrikes on the city in an apparent attempt to degrade defending forces' capacity and morale. It is a strategy that has so far failed in other cities such as Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. In the months before its invasion Russia had deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
4/20/2022,"Five weeks after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine threw the two families together, Nastya Slyvka has mastered the mysteries of Irish supermarkets, while her hosts, the Kirwans, have acquired a taste for borscht. The Kirwans were among the first in Ireland to host Ukrainian refugees in their home, an experiment thousands more Irish families are to follow, and at least in this corner of Dublin suburbia, so far so good. The tragedy unfolding 2,000 miles to the east feels ever-present but for the hosts and their guests, cohabiting under the same roof has kindled friendship and restored some faith in humanity. “The experience has been extremely positive. They’re phenomenal people,” said Jennie Kirwan, 40, seated at her kitchen table with her husband, Paul, while their daughters, Elsie, 10, and Aimee, eight, played in the living room with their new “brother”, Vlad, eight. Vlad’s mother, Slyvka, 32, is relieved their odyssey from Ukraine ended in the Kirwans’ bright, spacious south Dublin home. “They treat us very well. We are very lucky to have them.” It has become normal for the two families to converse via Microsoft Translator. Since arriving on 11 March the guests have settled into a routine. Vlad attends Rathfarnham parish national school, where Elsie and Aimee have helped him integrate. He has learned to shout “pass it” and other phrases on the football pitch. His mother makes forays to SuperValu for groceries and distracts herself from the news from home by cooking. The one thing she knew about Ireland before arriving was its creamy butter. Both families accept they will live together until it is safe for Slyvka and her son to return home – a blurry endpoint. “Having our own space for us now is not so important because they’re part of the family,” said Jennie. It is one story of thousands playing out across Ireland, not all of them happy. Approximately 23,500 Ukrainian refugees have arrived. About 15,000 have sought state-provided accommodation and ended up in reception centres, shelters, hotels and lodges of varying quality and suitability. With the government running out of emergency accommodation, and hundreds more Ukrainians arriving daily, an increasing number will be funneled to some of the 23,000 people who have volunteered to host refugees in their own homes or second properties. Vetting and inspections have slowed the process. A small number of hosts have returned their guests to reception centres after balking at the implications of sharing sofas, kitchens and bathrooms with strangers. “While it is an enormous influx, the system has coped extremely well,” said Liam O’Dwyer, the secretary general of the Irish Red Cross. “People coming in here are immediately able to access social welfare, health services, child benefit, school places etc so they are receiving the normal services and benefits of being a citizen.” O’Dwyer’s tips for hosting are ensure everyone in the household supports the idea, grant the guests privacy, and establish house rules. “Largely it works out,” he said. He opposes UK-style financial support for hosts. “When money comes into it, it’s a different class of an animal. When it’s voluntary it’s an extraordinary act of generosity and that gets a hugely positive response.” Many hosts disagree. They say financial support to cover higher bills would not taint altruism. “People aren’t doing it for the money, they’re doing it for their fellow humans, but energy costs have gone up 30%,” said Angie Gough, who hosts two Ukrainian families and helps run the site HelpingIrishHosts.com. “There is massive goodwill but this could last a year or more.” The government is considering granting financial support. Money issues aside, the Kirwans say hosting can be an enriching experience. They connected with the Slyvkas early in the conflict via Ukrainian expatriates in Ireland. Slyvka ran a small textile company with her husband, Yaroslav, in the southern city of Voznesensk. When Russian troops attacked in early March, Yaroslav drove his wife and son to the border with Moldova. He remained in Ukraine while Slyvka and Vlad trekked into Moldova, wheeling suitcases and carrying two small dogs. A week later they flew from Bucharest, Romania, to Dublin and moved into a bedroom in the Kirwan home. “My advice to other hosts is don’t overwhelm your guests at the start,” said Jennie, a school principal. “You may be desperate to bring them here or there, show them around, but all they’ll want at first is to stay put. Let them settle and decompress.” Paul detailed the Kirwans’ daily routine in a four-page document he translated into Ukrainian. Friends, relatives and local businesses sent food, clothes, toys, vouchers, cash and a bicycle. “The generosity has been insane. This puts back your faith in human nature,” said Paul. Slyvka receives approximately €200 a week (£165) in social welfare. She offered it to the Kirwans, who declined, so uses it to buy groceries. When not cooking, she insists on ironing and tidying. “The presses [cupboards] have never been so organised,” said Jennie. When the children are asleep the adults open a bottle of wine and converse via Microsoft Translator, which they consider better than Google’s version. Slyvka’s phone vibrates with endless updates from home, including missile alerts. “News, news, news,” she said. She puts on a brave face for Vlad but at times has wept and howled. There is also a sense of guilt that she is safe when so many compatriots are not. She would like to return within weeks but with Russia launching a new offensive her husband has urged her to stay put. Vlad expects to notify Father Christmas that he will be in Dublin for Christmas.",News/World news,‘They treat us very well’: Ukrainian refugees settle into Irish life,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/19/ukrainian-refugees-ireland-life
4/20/2022,"A group of more than 200 former senior UN officials have written to the UN secretary general, António Guterres, warning him that unless he does more personally to take a lead in trying to mediate a peace in Ukraine, the UN risks not just irrelevance, but its continued existence. The former staff members, including many former UN undersecretaries, urged him to raise his profile and be prepared to take personal risks to secure peace, saying the UN is facing an existential threat due to the invasion of Ukraine by one of the five permanent members of the security council. “What we and the broader public want to see, though, is a political UN presence and public engagement, in addition to the UN’s notable humanitarian response to the Ukraine crisis,” the authors said. “We want to see a clear strategy to re-establish peace, starting with a provisional ceasefire, and the use of the UN’s capacity for good offices, mediation and conflict-resolution. That could include visits to the conflict-stricken areas, discussions with the opposing sides, even moving your own office temporarily to Europe, closer to the urgently needed negotiations and, thereby, indicating the UN’s resolve to address this major crisis head-on.” There has been concern that mediation in Ukraine has been undertaken by actors ranging from Turkey, France, Israel, and Austria. By contrast during the Cuban missile crisis in 1961, the newly appointed Burmese UN secretary general, U Thant, played a major role in de-escalating and then mediating the conflict between Russia and the US. Similarly, during the buildup to the Gulf war the UN secretary general, Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, convinced the US to negotiate with Iraq. In 2013 the UN took the task of mediation so seriously that its senior envoy Sérgio Vieira de Mello was in Baghdad where he was killed in a terrorist blast at the UN headquarters. The authors of the letter include Jeffrey Feltman, UN undersecretary-general for political affairs 2012-2018; Andrew Gilmour, the former UN assistant secretary general for human rights between 2016 and 19; Franz Baumann, former UN assistant secretary general for the general assembly until 2015; Ajay Chhibber, assistant secretary general UNDP; and José Antonio Ocampo a former United Nations undersecretary general for economic and social affairs. “We have decided to raise our voice out of concern for the existential challenge that the United Nations is facing in this historic juncture,” they write. “The Russian invasion of Ukraine severely undermines the post-world war two global order. It is the pinnacle of a series of threats to humanity’s peace and security, shared prosperity and respect for human rights that the UN embodies.” Critics say Guterres has been immobilised due to the scale of the splits between the permanent members of the UN security council, as well as by votes in the general assembly that have revealed deep divisions including the expulsion of Russia from the UN human rights council. Supporters of Guterres argue he has been as clear as he can in criticising the invasion as inexcusable and deplorable without jeopardising his professional role. The authors of the letter admit they do not know if Guterres is involved in any behind-the-scenes mediation. “We know that you care deeply about ensuring a positive impact of our United Nations on humanity and the planet, which will also mark your legacy at the helm of the world body,” they write. “We therefore implore you to intensify your personal efforts, deploying all capabilities at your disposal and acting upon lessons learnt from previous conflicts, for the cessation of hostilities and conflict resolution through peaceful means. “This is the raison d’être of the United Nations, which is being tested again in this case. We are horrified at the alternative, the UN becoming increasingly irrelevant and, eventually, succumbing to the fate of its predecessor, the League of Nations, with the human losses and material destruction that went with it.”",News/World news,António Guterres urged to take lead in securing peace in Ukraine or risk future of UN,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/19/antonio-guterres-urged-to-take-lead-in-securing-peace-in-ukraine-or-risk-future-of-un
4/20/2022,"Just Stop Oil has said it will suspend its direct actions against fuel distribution for a week, but has told the prime minister its members will escalate their disruptive protests “if you do not fulfil your duty to the people”. For two and a half weeks, the climate activists have been targeting oil terminals and oil tankers in the Midlands and the south-east of England with blockades and mass trespass. The government and petrol retailers have attempted to downplay the scale of the disruption to fuel deliveries. But there have been widespread reports of petrol station forecourts running dry in various parts of the country. Just Stop Oil’s activists have vowed to continue their campaign until the government agrees to a ban on new oil and gas extraction projects, or until they are all jailed. A letter to Boris Johnson, read out at Downing Street on Tuesday morning by two campaign supporters, said: “The bill for oil and gas is already being paid by millions around the world, in the global south, and can now also be seen in blood and suffering in Ukraine. “The truth is that this is the price we are all going to pay for allowing the grip of oil to continue its hold on us. This cost, the horror of war in Europe, must not be used as a pretext to advance an even greater tragedy – that of continuing to invest in new fossil fuel extraction, for which there is no popular support.” The letter said they would pause their actions until 25 April – next Monday – “to give you the opportunity to make a statement on behalf of the government that it will immediately halt all future licensing and consents for the exploration, development and production of fossil fuels in the UK. “If you do not fulfil your duty to the people we will be left with no choice but to escalate our campaign of civil resistance.” On 1 April, Just Stop Oil began its campaign with coordinated blockades targeting 10 oil terminals in Birmingham, Warwickshire, Hampshire, Essex and London. The campaign, which was supported by Extinction Rebellion, aimed to disrupt fuel deliveries, particularly to the south-east and London. Within days there were anecdotal reports of fuel shortages and while petrol retailers insisted the disruption was manageable, a source at one admitted that was only because it had been able to divert supplies from terminals farther north. Official figures later showed that in the three days after protests started, deliveries to petrol stations were down 43% in the West Midlands, 44% in London and 48% in the east. As police battled to minimise the disruption possible from blockades, the protesters shifted tactics. On 6 April they staged their first mass trespass, at the Navigator oil terminal in Grays, Essex, where activists climbed spike-topped fences and ran to a loading bay to obstruct equipment with lock-ons. Reports of petrol station shortages multiplied, given added weight by a claim by the petrol consumers group FairFuelUK – subsequently reversed – that it had “credible intelligence” that one in three pumps were running dry. Downing Street condemned the “guerrilla tactics” of protesters, while Priti Patel, the home secretary, said “people across the country [were] seeing their lives brought to a standstill” by disruption, and Labour called for “nationwide injunctions” to ban the protests. At least three oil distribution companies have obtained injunctions. Last week, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Navigator Thames, ExxonMobil and Valero were among “a number of key operators in the oil sector” that had obtained court orders to ban protests at their sites. The department also confirmed that injunctions granted to ban Insulate Britain’s protests on key roads in the south-east were still in force. Meanwhile, direct actions have continued, with Just Stop Oil saying they will not stop until the government meets their demand, or they are all jailed. Just Stop Oil said they were still collating their tally, but that the number of arrests linked to the campaign so far could be as high as 1,100. They have previously said about 400 have taken part in the campaign. On Tuesday morning, five were on remand. Two had been transferred to prison in Essex before a court appearance on charges of aggravated trespass on Wednesday. Three more were brought to London from the Midlands on Tuesday to appear at the high court on charges of breaking an injunction.",News/Environment,Just Stop Oil calls one-week halt to protests in hope of action from No 10,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/19/just-stop-oil-calls-one-week-halt-to-protests-in-hope-of-action-from-no-10
4/20/2022,"Let me be the first to admit that I’m not an expert on testicles. I’m not even an amateur enthusiast, if I’m being honest. Still, even with my limited knowledge of the subject, I was taken aback by recent reports that applying infrared beams to the little fellas might be the key to saving men and averting the apocalypse. The source of these unusual claims? Fox News, that perennial font of spuriously sourced wisdom. Tucker Carlson, one of the most popular pundits on the network, recently had the Ohio-based fitness professional Andrew McGovern on his show to discuss how one might “reverse the effects of falling testosterone”. (As everyone knows, if you’ve got a complex question about hormones, personal trainers make far better sources than endocrinologists.) One of McGovern’s ideas to increase testosterone was red light therapy or “testicle tanning”, which he described as a “bromeopathic” therapy. Carlson, who has spent much of the past year spreading misinformation about Covid vaccines, and recently joked about how he’s unvaccinated, appeared intrigued by the unorthodox concept. “Open your mind,” he told the singer Kid Rock, a guest on his programme, who was rather more sceptical. “Don’t you think, at this point, when so many of the therapies, the paths they’ve told us to take, have turned out to be dead ends that really hurt people, why wouldn’t open-minded people seek new solutions?” (Kid Rock did not agree – and when Kid Rock is the voice of a reason in an argument you know things are dire.) Carlson’s own mind, it should be said, has been bursting open at the seams with testosterone recently. The broadcaster has a new documentary coming out called The End of Men which, as far as I can gather, is all about how men aren’t as tough as they used to be and don’t produce as much sperm as they used to do, and how we’re all going to die because of this. I say “as far as I can gather”, because the documentary’s trailer, a condensed version of which just went viral on Twitter, doesn’t contain a coherent argument, just lots and lots of crotch shots. It’s an incredibly homoerotic montage of muscly men, including one very bizarre shot of a naked dude standing in front of what looks like a large lateral flow test with a red glow around his manly bits. While Carlson’s visual metaphors are inspired, the meat of his documentary appears to be anything but. If I had a penny for every time a highly privileged rightwing man proclaimed masculinity to be in peril I would have more money than Elon Musk. Last year, for example, the Republican politician Josh Hawley lamented that feminists and the left want to “give us a world beyond men”. These evil forces have demonised men, Hawley said, forcing them to withdraw into the “enclave of idleness and pornography and video games”. Which honestly doesn’t sound like such a bad deal to me. But I’ll give credit where it’s due. Carlson’s opinions on the crisis of masculinity may be trite, but I think his embrace of testicle tanning is, overall, a positive development. Much of the man’s time is currently spent broadcasting racist and hateful ideas to large swathes of the US. If we can get him to embrace “bromeopathy” instead, if we can turn him into the male equivalent of Gwyneth Paltrow, we can minimise his harm. Far better that he sells luxury testicle tanners on his own version of Goop than peddles hate on Fox News. That said, I don’t want to imply that people like Carlson and Hawley are entirely off base when they complain about masculinity being in peril. They are, in fact, entirely correct that the modern world is bad for men. But it’s not woke culture men need to be worried about: it’s toxic chemicals and pollution, not gender theory, that are are shrinking penises and lowering sperm counts. But how on earth do we get these rightwingers to realise they need to be more concerned about the climate crisis than the left? It’s a tough nut to crack.

4/20/2022,"The International Monetary Fund has cut its global growth forecasts because of the war in Ukraine, warning that Russia’s invasion could lead to the fragmentation of the world economy into rival blocs. In a half-yearly update, the IMF said prospects had worsened “significantly” in the past three months as it reduced its growth estimate for 2022 from 4.4% to 3.6%. The fund said every member of the G7 group of leading industrialised nations and the bigger developing countries would grow less rapidly this year than previously expected, and there was a strong risk of an even worse outcome. “In the matter of a few weeks, the world has yet again experienced a major, transformative shock. Just as a durable recovery from the pandemic-induced global economic collapse appeared in sight, the war has created the very real prospect that a large part of the recent gains will be erased,” said Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF’s economic counsellor and director of research. The UK is expected to be the joint-best performer in the G7 this year despite having its growth estimate cut from 4.7% to 3.7%, but is set to be the worst performer next year when the IMF is pencilling in expansion of just 1.2%. Consumer spending is predicted to be weaker than expected as the cost of living crisis bites while tighter financial conditions are expected to cool investment. The US will suffer the least damage from the war and has had its growth forecast for 2022 shaved by 0.3 points to 3.7%. Germany and Italy, both more exposed to Russia, have had their growth estimates reduced by 1.7 points and 1.5 points respectively, to 2.1% and 2.3%. Russia is on course for two years of falling output as a result of western sanctions (8.5% this year and 2.3% in 2023), while Ukraine’s economy will shrink by 35% in 2022 and feel the impact of the conflict for years to come, the IMF said in its world economic outlook. The IMF produces the outlook in April and October, with updates in January and July. Six months ago it was expecting the easing of pandemic pressures to result in global growth of 4.9% this year. “Global economic prospects have worsened significantly since our last World Economic Outlook forecast in January,” Gourinchas said. “This crisis unfolds while the global economy was on a mending path but had not yet fully recovered from the Covid pandemic, with a significant divergence between the economic recoveries of advanced economies and emerging market and developing ones. Overall risks to economic prospects have risen sharply and policy trade-offs have become ever more challenging.” Against a backdrop of soaring inflation fuelled by Vladimir Putin’s war, the Washington-based fund said “decisive actions” to rein in spiralling prices needed to be taken by global central banks. However, it said this process must be clearly communicated to avoid a sudden shift in financial markets. Publishing its global financial stability report alongside the economic outlook, the IMF warned rates rising further than expected could cause a “sharp decline” in the value of a range of assets. “Financial stability risks have risen on several fronts since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and they may test the resilience of global financial markets amid huge uncertainties,” it said. The IMF said a further two percentage points could be shaved off global growth next year in the event the war in Ukraine led to even higher energy prices, entrenched inflation and big losses on financial markets. Gourinchas said the war had increased the risk of “a more permanent fragmentation of the world economy into geopolitical blocs with distinct technology standards, cross-border payment systems, and reserve currencies. “Such a tectonic shift would entail high adjustment costs and long-run efficiency losses as supply chains and production networks are reconfigured. It also represents a major challenge to the rules-based framework that has governed international and economic relations for the last 70 years.” He added: “The economic effects of the war are spreading far and wide … mainly through commodity markets, trade, and financial linkages. “In many countries, inflation has become a central concern … There is a rising risk that inflation expectations become de-anchored, prompting a more aggressive tightening response from central banks. In emerging market and developing economies, increases in food and fuel prices could significantly increase the risk of social unrest.” The IMF expects inflation to average 5.7% in advanced economies and 8.7% in emerging market and developing economies this year – 1.8 and 2.8 percentage points higher than projected in January.",News/Business,IMF cuts global growth forecast over Ukraine war,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/19/imf-cuts-global-growth-forecast-over-ukraine-war
4/20/2022,"Things are not the same as they were before the pandemic. We have a new highly transmissible disease in our midst and we can’t expect that doing the same thing as before coronavirus will lead to the same results. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the minister for government efficiency, has written to all secretaries of state asking them to encourage civil servants in their departments back into the workplace: “Now that we are learning to live with Covid and have lifted all legal restrictions in England, we must continue to accelerate the return of civil servants to office buildings to realise the benefits of face-to-face, collaborative working and the wider benefits for the economy.” It’s understood that full capacity doesn’t mean all civil servants returning to work in person, apparently due to the lack of space in Whitehall offices, but secretaries have been urged “to issue a clear message to civil servants” to return to the office so that departments can “run at full capacity”. This blanket edict comes in direct contradiction to a report from the Institute for Government thinktank. Reducing hybrid working opportunities, it suggests, will mean the government struggles to achieve its goals of competing with the private sector to recruit its preferred candidates for civil service positions, relocating centres of civil service away from the capital and reducing the size of its estate. Perhaps more pertinently, encouraging people unnecessarily into crowded work environments is not a good strategy for controlling Covid transmission, especially when rates are already extremely high, as they are now. The phrase “learning to live with Covid”, as used by Rees-Mogg, has become a byword among government ministers for removing all Covid mitigations and returning to pre-pandemic practices. But things are not the same as they were before. As we have seen over the past few weeks, the “return to normal” has been accompanied by large-scale disruption to schools and businesses due to infections and reinfections. The NHS is once again under extreme pressure. Years of austerity combined with Covid has brought the service to its knees. Waiting lists in England for routine care are at record highs. In the longer term we should expect millions of people to catch Covid each year resulting in a population that is generally less healthy both from the burden of infection and the long-term consequences of the virus. The regressive move of forcing people back into busy workplaces can only be expected to exacerbate our Covid problems. Taking away the tools that mitigate the spread of Covid – free testing, supported isolation, mask mandates and flexible working – or the tools that help us monitor the situation (the Zoe symptom tracker study and the React-1 survey) won’t ameliorate the UK’s Covid situation, but only make it worse. It smacks of a government that is desperate to put the pandemic behind it by simply ignoring what is happening. Instead, we should be increasing basic public health measures such as contract tracing, testing and surveillance, rather than scaling them back. We should improve public health communication so people understand how best to protect themselves and their communities. We should be instituting mandatory criteria for the quality of indoor air by improving ventilation, filtration and sterilisation, as well as encouraging people to wear high-grade masks in indoor public settings. If, as seems likely, the government is going to accept the huge disease burden that Covid poses, then, at the very least, we must address the chronic underfunding facing the NHS. Capacity must be scaled up and additional resources funnelled to primary care alongside the integration of sustainable plans for social care. Unfortunately, it turns out that Covid is a problem you can only tackle head on. Closing your eyes and hoping for the best doesn’t work. Nor does declaring the pandemic over, as former health secretary Matt Hancock has done. No matter how loudly the government protests, the virus won’t listen.

4/20/2022,"Gloom at the International Monetary Fund is nothing new. Since last summer the body responsible for stabilising and supporting the world economy has been growing ever more pessimistic. First it was rising inflationary pressures caused by supply-side bottlenecks. Then it was the arrival of the new Omicron variant towards the end of 2021. Now it is the war in Ukraine, something not anticipated when the Washington-based organisation last published its assessment in January but which dominates the IMF’s world economic outlook. It is not just the fact that Russia’s invasion will lead to appreciably slower growth and higher inflation this year – although both look inevitable. The IMF also warns the war has exacerbated two tricky policy dilemmas, one facing central banks and one troubling finance ministers. For central banks, such as the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve, the issue is how to tackle mounting cost of living crises without killing off still incomplete recoveries from the pandemic. That’s not going to be easy, as the IMF freely admits. For finance ministers, such as Rishi Sunak, it is getting the balance right between protecting the most vulnerable while repairing the damage caused to the public finances by Covid-19 spending. The IMF understands the difficulties but warns against being too penny-pinching. “Following a huge and necessary fiscal expansion in many countries during the pandemic, debt levels are at all-time highs and governments are more exposed than ever to higher interest rates. The need for consolidation should not prevent governments from prioritising spending with well-targeted support for the vulnerable – including refugees, those struggling because of commodity price spikes, and those affected by the pandemic,” it said. The war, the extent to which central banks raise interest rates and the speed at which finance ministries raise taxes and cut spending will be three of the five key factors shaping the short-term direction of the global economy, the IMF says in its world economic outlook. The other two will be the slowdown in China caused by lockdowns and whether the impact of the pandemic fades as expected from this spring onwards. In the longer term, the Fund is worried that the war will add to de-globalisation forces, leading to fragmentation, rival blocs and weaker multilateral collaboration in areas such as climate change and debt relief. The pandemic – by exposing the fragility of global supply chains – had already pushed the world some way down this path. By highlighting Russia’s vital role in energy markets the war in Ukraine has given this process a further hefty shove.",News/Business,IMF tells governments to protect vulnerable people when tackling Covid debt,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/19/imf-governments-covid-debt-world-economic-outlook
4/20/2022,"Russian forces have seized the city of Kreminna in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region and Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from the city, the regional governor has said. Kreminna, a city of more than 18,000 people about 350 miles (560km) south-east of the capital, Kyiv, appears to be the first city captured in a Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine. “Kreminna is under the control of the ‘Orcs’ [Russians]. They have entered the city,” Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, told a briefing on Tuesday. “Our defenders had to withdraw. They have entrenched themselves in new positions and continue to fight the Russian army.” He said Russian forces had attacked “from all sides”. “It is impossible to calculate the number of dead among the civilian population. We have official statistics – about 200 dead – but in reality there are many more,” he said, without making it clear what period the estimated death toll covered. Russia denies targeting civilians. Evacuated residents from the city have said they are unable to reach relatives and friends there. Olena Stetsenko, the head of the City Korupus volunteer organisation located in Kreminna, was evacuated from the city in mid-March. Stetsenko was one of the last to reach someone inside the city before her mobile signal was fully cut off at lunchtime on Monday, she said, hours after Russian forces reportedly took the city. There has been a pattern of Ukrainian towns and villages losing mobile connection shortly after falling under Russian occupation. “My relative said [on Monday] that there were Russian planes and helicopters flying over the town,” said Stetsenko. “They said that [the Russians] were using every single type of heavy equipment: grads [rocket launchers], tanks. “As of yesterday, they were on the outskirts of the city and there was street fighting going on. The [Russians] are afraid to come into the city because of mines,” said Stetsenko, who estimates there are about 3,500 residents left in the city. Natalia Chekhuta, the head of Kreminna’s regional administration from 2015 to 2019, said she was devastated. Chekhuta, who is still a regional councillor for the city, said she had been running volunteer evacuation missions from the start of the war. At first, not many people wanted to evacuate, she said, but in the last three weeks evacuations began “en masse”. Chekhuta and her team were heading to Kreminna on 18 April to collect people as Russian troops broke through Ukrainian defence lines and entered the city. Ukrainian soldiers in a neighbouring town would not let them pass. She found out that one family had tried to leave and their car was shot at – two of them died and another was injured. “The people we were going to collect were ringing me, asking me to still come,” said Chekhuta. “It was so hard; since then we’ve had no contact.” On Saturday 16 April, two days before Russian forces occupied the city, the Guardian travelled there to witness what was the last evacuation of Kreminna residents. In Kreminna’s centre on Saturday, a white armoured bus pulled up on an unassuming street corner and civilians dashed out of basements under scuffed apartment blocks towards the vehicle, clutching bags and pets in their arms. The conductor of the armoured evacuation bus, being run by the local NGO Vostok SOS, crammed their belongings into the hold. The 17 evacuees hugged loved ones and said teary goodbyes to the backdrop of not so distant booms. Those who stayed watched the bus pull away from the cover of the arches of Soviet-era apartment blocks. A stone’s throw away from the pickup point in Kreminna, debris from a recent attack blocked access and the bus had to take a longer and more dangerous detour around the city under the constant threat of more incoming artillery rounds. An elderly man who has trouble walking and with his eyesight was led towards the bus by a younger man. A tense group effort was made to lift him on to the bus and get his legs into a position where was able to sit down inside. The bus then collected a middle-aged woman, who was accompanied by a man who kissed her goodbye in the aisle before jumping off. Victoria Slobodyansk, a 61-year-old retired English teacher, who was travelling with her husband, Oleksandr, her cat in a basket on her lap and a guinea pig in a bag at her feet, said she was leaving because of the images she had seen of Bucha and Hostomel, two towns in the Kyiv region that were devastated under Russian occupation. Speaking from a town in Dnipro region after being evacuated, Slobodyansk said she had been trying to contact her friends and help other people contact their relatives but with no luck. “Someone who’s in France and hasn’t heard from her grandfather for 48 hours has asked me to make calls,” she said. “I know people who live in the same apartment block but none of them have signal. “We are all so worried. All of our souls are hurting for Kreminna. It’s a small town but it’s clean and pretty and we all love it very much.” Slobodyansk said that before she left the city, there had been no gas for three weeks. She said electricity had been cut several times though local workers had managed to re-establish the connection on 15 April. She said residents had been cooking on the streets when there was no electricity. “We knew that it was going to be hard and we knew that they were going to bomb us but our guys would manage to withstand them,” said Slobodyansk. “But we understand that it was hard for them; they were defending their positions for weeks.” Reuters contributed to this report",News/World news,Russian forces capture first city in battle for Donbas,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/19/russian-forces-capture-first-city-battle-donbas-kreminna
4/20/2022,"Voices rise and fall, picking their way through songs and wordless sounds. They break and bend, whisper and tremble. There are cries and ululations, gentle bluesy riffs, operatic moments and open-throated roars, as well as moments when singers are groping for a melody or discovering a new sound, filling the British Pavilion at Venice with a glorious cacophony. Called Feeling Her Way, Sonia Boyce’s multilayered installation is a joyous, tremulous performance for a chorus of Black female voices (Jacqui Dankworth, Poppy Ajudha, Sofia Jernberg and Tanita Tikaram). Each singer is literally feeling her way through the music, guided by Belize-born British composer Errollyn Wallen. We must feel our way, too, through the space and dissonance, the different tempos and moods and the different characters, qualities and approaches of the musicians. Togetherness and apartness, soulfulness and drive – these are what guide them. Sometimes improvising for the first time, sometimes duetting or surprising themselves with some unbidden echo, the singers seem to be discovering as much as they are performing in their familiar ways. The music has a great and sometimes accidental resonance and complexity. It unfolds as you move through the five spaces of Boyce’s pavilion, the sense of folding and reconfiguring, like a kind of aural origami. Somehow, the repetitions never sound the same, depending on where the listener is, attending first to one singer, then another. Suggesting some kind of resolution that never comes, the filmed performances rearrange themselves in space and time. You don’t have to work at it so much as let yourself go, as you realise that is what the singers are doing, too. Of Boyce’s recent work, this is the most accomplished I have seen, the one that exceeds intention, taking on a life and vitality of its own. Boyce redoubles the musical complexity with her installation, presenting the filmed performances (some of which took place at Abbey Road studios) against a tessellated, montaged wallpaper of photographic shots of studio details – microphone stands and cables, mixing desk consoles, sound-baffles and flooring, mixed in with geometric patterning. Overhead and on the floor, geometric golden forms – derived from iron pyrite crystals – cluster and spread, bunch-up in corners and provide seating for visitors. They mirror what is around them, while also reflecting the order and random structures of music itself. A long wall at the rear of the pavilion has a silvery wallpaper redolent of a 1970s bedroom, on which Boyce presents photographs and collaged displays of old CD, cassette and album covers, along with posters and other ephemera. All part of Boyce’s personal archive, and still bearing their discount price tags, these albums by Shirley Bassey, Beverley Knight, Brown Sugar and Five Star are reverentially presented as though on a teenager’s bedroom wall. When Boyce was younger, there was scant representation of Black female artists in the UK. Music gave her a sense of belonging and sustenance. This archival impulse and sense of communality, continues in the French Pavilion next door, where French-Algerian, London-based artist Zineb Sedira includes a film in which Boyce and curator Gilane Tawadros discuss cultural resistance and survival in communities of colour. At first seeming aurally and visually dissonant and fragmentary, Feeling Her Way reveals itself as a simultaneous expression of individuality and collaboration, and the affirmation of the creative spirit.",Arts/Art and design,‘A glorious cacophony of Black female voices’ – Sonia Boyce’s soul train hits Venice,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/19/sonia-boyce-soul-train-venice-biennale-british-pavilion-glorious-cacophany-black-female-voices
4/20/2022,"“I love anchovies, but often find I have a couple of fillets or those mashed-up bits at the bottom of the tin left over. What can I do with them and the oil?”Jane, Ludlow Ah, anchovies: the little fishes with the big flavour that are equally at home in pasta sauces and stews as they are in a dressing or butter (to rub a roast chicken or lamb, say), or simply eaten on toast. Happily, a little goes a long way, which is good news for Jane and her near-empty tins. “I love anchovies and have them all the time,” says Patrick Martinez, founder of The Tinned Fish Market. And he’s not kidding; the oily fish have made their way into his dinner for the past two nights running. If you’ve got a fillet or two going, Martinez recommends this “very rich, very quick” spaghetti dish: first, get your pasta cooking, and tear some bread (“you want generously-sized breadcrumbs”). Mash up the anchovie,s then fry n some oil from the tin for about 30 seconds. “Add finely sliced garlic for 30 seconds to a minute, then add the breadcrumbs and fry to soak up the oil.” When the spaghetti is ready, drain and stir in a generous spoonful of cream cheese to melt, loosening with some reserved pasta water if need be. “Add the crumbs, stir gently, then all you need is a squeeze of lemon to balance the oiliness and some pepper.” Puttanesca is another eminently sensible way to use up stray fillets, as is the top of a pizza or onion tart. However, when it comes to those broken-up bits lurking in the bottom of the tin, it’s got to be mayonnaise. Chef Ben Tish, who is behind the menu at the recently opened The Princess Royal in west London, says: “Blend egg yolks with any bits of anchovy going, their oil, and mustard, then top up with olive oil.” This can then be used for a multitude of things, but devilled eggs are a current Tish favourite – “that’s delicious”. Alternatively, knock up a vinaigrette: “In a bowl, whisk the anchovies and their oil, add some lemon juice, red-wine vinegar and extra-virgin olive oil, and whisk again.” This is good for drizzling over salads, such as farro, rocket, pomegranate and grilled artichokes. “Toss with the vinaigrette, and you’ve got all those salty and sweet bits.” Also good for topping salads are Martinez’s breadcrumbs from his pasta dish, while food writer and self-confessed anchovy fan Alison Roman uses fillets to make white beans magic. In her book Nothing Fancy, she cooks sliced garlic in olive oil, then adds the fish fillets, capers and chilli flakes, and sizzles until the little fish melt. She tosses in white beans, cooks for about 10 minutes, then finishes with salad leaves, herbs, parmesan and a squeeze of lemon. Serve as is or, Roman writes, “I do dream about eating it with grilled whole trout or lamb shoulder with garlicky tomatoes.” You could also spread this anchovy joy on a kind-of pan con tomate. Tish grills focaccia or ciabatta, then smears it with broken anchovies and their oil. “Top with tomatoes, crush those in as well, and you’ve got a smoky tomato bread.” It will taste even better once those tomatoes hit their stride this summer.

4/20/2022,"A cabinet minister has defended Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak over their Partygate penalties, equating them to fines issued to speeding motorists, as the prime minister prepares to argue he did not mislead parliament. When asked if lawmakers could be lawbreakers, the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, told Sky News on Tuesday morning: “I think we do see consistently, whether it is through parking fines or speeding fines, ministers of both parties over the years have been in that position. “We’ve had prime ministers in the past who have received penalty notices, from what I can see, and also frontbench ministers. “I saw there was a parking notice that Tony Blair had once. We’ve seen frontbench Labour ministers [be fined] and, let’s be frank, government ministers as well.” He added: “You’ve asked me, can someone who sets the laws and the rules, can they also be someone who breaks the rules? That clearly has happened with a number of ministers over the years.” Later on BBC Radio 4, Lewis clarified that he was not trying to equate a speeding ticket with the “sacrifices people made through Covid”, but added: “A minister or a parliamentarian getting a fixed-penalty notice, accepting that, acknowledging that, and apologising for that, is the right way to handle it.” Facing claims that the prime minister deliberately misled MPs over his knowledge of a Downing Street party, Lewis said Johnson’s apology did not mean that what he had earlier told parliament was not correct. On Sky News earlier, asked when Johnson came to the view he’d broken the law, Lewis said it was “when the police had issued a fine”. Johnson is expected to use this defence as he faces MPs for the first time since he received a fixed-penalty notice for breaking his own Covid laws by attending a No 10 lockdown party for his birthday. He is expected to make a “full-throated apology” in the Commons on Tuesday, according to PA News agency. However, Johnson, thought to be the first sitting prime minister to be criminally sanctioned, is expected to stop short of addressing the Partygate allegations. He will call for a renewed focus on the Ukraine crisis, and the government’s controversial policy to send asylum seekers to Rwanda. Downing Street later refused several times to back Lewis’s comparison of the Partygate fines to fixed penalty notices issued to motorists for speeding. Boris Johnson’s spokesperson said he had “talked about understanding the strength of feeling about this issue, which is why he has apologised and fully respects the outcome of the police investigation”. He did not dispute briefings over the weekend saying the prime minister thought he had done nothing wrong, but said Johnson had made clear that “many will feel that he fell short” of the rules. After the Conservative MP Michael Fabricant accused many teachers and hospital workers of having after-work drinks, too, Johnson’s spokesperson could not point to any evidence of that happening. “I can’t speak to what may or may not have happened in in other workplaces where people are required to be in work,” he added. If Johnson is fined again by police, No 10 confirmed he would say so publicly. Lewis talked down any prospect of a leadership challenge against Johnson, saying the prime minister was focused on “how we move our country forward” and getting the “big calls right” – pointing to Brexit, Covid, the war in Ukraine and the cost of living crisis. While Johnson hopes to ride out the storm, the full Whitehall report into Partygate by Sue Gray is yet to be published, and police are still investigating up to six further gatherings where Johnson is said to have been present. In the Commons, opposition MPs will question why the prime minister insisted repeatedly that no rules had been broken. Emily Thornberry, the shadow attorney general, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We’re not going to get the result we should get unless the prime minister looks into his own conscience and decides he should do the right thing.” She added: “We’re not going to get that because the PM doesn’t tell the truth.” While Thornberry said Johnson would get “a good reception” for his actions on the Ukraine crisis, she said he was expected not only to give “another weak apology” but accept he lied to parliament and explain how he “squares that” with his own ministerial code. Opposition parties are pushing for the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, to allow a vote on a debate about whether the prime minister should be held in contempt of parliament, potentially launching an investigation into whether the Commons was misled. Anything that requires a vote, however, is likely to fail given the Tories’ large majority. On Saturday, Conservative MPs across the country said they believed traditional supporters were abandoning them after the prime minister’s penalty. The former immigration minister Caroline Nokes wrote in the Observer that she was sticking with her decision to submit a letter of no confidence in Johnson.",News/Politics,"Partygate penalties ‘like parking fines’, says cabinet minister",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/19/partygate-penalties-like-parking-fines-says-cabinet-minister
4/20/2022,"As many as four in 10 people in Britain could fall into fuel poverty when the price cap rises again this autumn, energy bosses have told MPs as they called for more government support for vulnerable households facing a “truly horrific” winter. Michael Lewis, the chief executive of E.ON UK, said between 30% and 40% of people in Britain might go into fuel poverty from October when the industry regulator, Ofgem, is again expected to put up the annual limit on tariffs. “We are expecting a severe impact on customers’ ability to pay,” he told MPs at the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee in parliament, adding that he expected debts of customers to rise by 50%, or £800m.   How does the energy price cap work? The cap, one of the biggest shake-ups of the energy market since privatisation, came into effect on 1 January 2019 for 11m households on default tariffs, known as standard variable tariffs (SVTs). The government told the energy regulator, Ofgem, to set the cap because ministers argued people on SVTs were being ripped off by big energy firms capitalising on consumer loyalty. The limit is not an absolute one but the maximum suppliers can charge per unit of energy and for a standing charge. There is a separate cap for 4m homes on prepayment meters. So why are prices moving higher? In short: if energy market prices climb higher, the cap must move higher, too. The cap is designed to reflect the costs energy suppliers face, the largest of which is sourcing gas and electricity from the wholesale markets. In recent months energy markets have reached historic highs because of tight global gas supplies, causing one of the steepest energy price increases on record. Market prices have continued to climb since the new cap was announced, meaning another rise is likely in April once the regulator has revised its cost assessments. Is there any way to avoid the increase? In the past, households could save hundreds of pounds a year by spending a few minutes on one of the many comparison sites, or by signing up to an auto-switching service, and moving to a cheaper tariff, either with their existing supplier or a rival one. But the recent market surge means even fixed tariffs, which are not covered by the cap, are more expensive than the energy price cap itself. The best bet to keep bills in check is to use less energy: if you can afford to invest in insulation this can make a major difference to how much energy you need. Lowering the thermostat by a couple of degrees may also be an option for some.  When will bills begin to fall again? It is too soon to say. Energy market experts believe gas and electricity wholesale prices will remain high through the winter and into 2022 because energy demand is recovering rapidly after the worst of the Covid-19 crisis. Some believe households may face rising energy bills for another 18 months. In addition to market prices, the regulator includes the cost of using energy networks and paying for government policies – which are also expected to keep rising.Jillian Ambrose He said that a larger number of people moving into fuel poverty would lead to a significant increase in bad debt. Customers have been calling energy providers expressing their worry at the huge increase in their bills. ScottishPower alone had received 8,000 calls from customers concerned about their ability to pay, its chief executive, Keith Anderson, told MPs. He said he was “massively concerned” for people facing rising bills who would “really, really struggle” and called for the introduction of a £1,000 deficit fund or social tariff for vulnerable customers. The fund would take £1,000 off the bills of the poorest people in the country in October and the government or consumers would then pay this off over 10 years, he suggested. The energy regulator lifted the price cap on bills earlier this month, sending the average household dual-fuel tariff from £1,278 to £1,971. That is due to increase again in October, with some experts expecting the price cap to hit £2,600. “Come October that’s going to get horrific, truly horrific,” said Anderson. “It has got to a stage now where the size and scale of it is beyond what I can deal with, beyond what I think this industry can deal with. I think it needs a massive shift, a significant shift in the government policy and approach towards this.” The EDF chief executive, Simone Rossi, said it had seen a 40% increase in calls from customers worried about debt. “We are concerned about what is in front of us,” he said. “Unfortunately pre-payment customers are being hit first. We now see bills being higher for longer, so I would expect government to reassess in short order to see what is possible.” Earlier the chief executive of Ofgem, Jonathan Brearley, had said that increases in fuel bills would be investigated amid concerns that suppliers may be charging households unfairly. Gas prices in particular have surged in recent months, prompting almost every household energy supplier to raise prices to the maximum allowed. However, some consumer groups have argued that energy firms have raised prices by more than needed, to strengthen their own balance sheets at customers’ expense. Brearley told BBC Radio 4: “We’re going to take a close look at those direct debits. We’re going to make sure that they are raised fairly – clearly prices have gone up – and if they haven’t been we’ll take action and make sure companies put it right. “You shouldn’t take more than is necessary. You shouldn’t be building up a credit balance.” He said price increases must be brought in “reasonably and fairly” and not for “other reasons outside of the customer interest”. Energy companies should be ringfencing customer money so that it is only used to pay for their gas and electricity, he said.",News/Business,Energy chiefs fear 40% of Britons could fall into fuel poverty in ‘truly horrific winter’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/19/energy-chiefs-fear-40-of-britons-could-fall-into-fuel-poverty-in-truly-horrific-winter
4/20/2022,"Boris Johnson became the first sitting prime minister to be criminally sanctioned when he was fined for breaking his own Covid laws by attending a party for his birthday in No 10. While the development prompted renewed calls for his resignation, loyal ministers and Downing Street sources have reached for some creative and elaborate defences of his law breaking. As Johnson prepared to argue he did not mislead parliament, the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, told Sky News on Tuesday morning: I think we do see consistently, whether it is through parking fines or speeding fines, ministers of both parties over the years have been in that position. A senior government source told the Financial Times he had “no idea” what was guiding the Met police investigation after Johnson was given a fixed-penalty notice for attending a party for his birthday in No 10. He added: It’s not as if [Johnson] walked into a rave in Ibiza. Is another defence for Johnson, who was fined for breaching the rules by attending his 56th birthday party in June 2020. Sources told the Daily Mail Johnson was only there “for 10 minutes” and the cake “did not even leave the Tupperware box”. The prime minister was there for a very short time. He was eating a salad lunch in the Cabinet room with people he worked with all day. People kept popping in. Tory MP Michael Fabricant dismissed the fines on BBC Radio 5 Live, saying lots of people, ranging from civil servants to nurses and others, “did at the end of the day have a quiet drink”. He also said: The ways it’s been characterised, you would think there were pole dancers. A source told The Times there was an exemption for those working in No 10, in close proximity and for long hours. There was always an exemption around work but the prime minister accepted mistakes were made. If you’re going from meeting to meeting and it’s something at 2pm in the afternoon, people wouldn’t particularly call that a party. You don’t tend to call that a party. This was the line that came from a Tory MP in January on Channel 4 News in January. Conor Burns said it was not a “premeditated” party and that Johnson was working in the room before staff came in and presented him with a birthday cake. He was, in a sense, ambushed with a cake. Those were the words of the Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell in January, saying there are ministers who get parking tickets and speed fines. “Lots of people break the law in small ways, sometimes unintentionally” he said, adding: He’s not robbed a bank. This is getting out of control. Stepping to Johnson’s defence January, the Conservative MP James Heappey told the BBC no prime minister can possibly own all that is put into their diary, adding they rely entirely on those around them for briefs and support for what goes into diaries in the first place. He said: My take as someone who has worked in Downing Street is that the prime minister doesn’t really own his own diary. In January, the Conservative MP Peter Bone described the party for Johnson to BBC Newsnight as “a very funny party” with colleagues for less than 10 minutes. He added that “political people alike” likely spoke about work while eating their “bit of cake”. He added: Well, I just don’t recognise that as a party.

4/20/2022,"We have the Leeds Piano Competition to thank for first showcasing the unique poetry of Radu Lupu’s playing: the young Romanian pianist won first prize there in 1969. That success launched his international career, but as the years went by he became a more and more reticent performer, both in the concert hall and on disc. Yet every rare opportunity to hear him was a reminder of just how special a pianist he was, in a repertory that extended from Mozart and Beethoven to Bartók and Janáček, and who was quite peerless in Schubert, Schumann and Brahms. Here are just a few examples of his art. Video recordings of Lupu’s performances are hard to find, so this Mozart concerto with David Zinman and the Deutsche Kammerphiharmonie is a rarity to be treasured. Taken from a recital in Moscow in 2012, he also recorded the Impromptus in 1983 for Decca. Recorded live in 1983 and a perfect example of Lupu’s ability to transform a relatively modest work, by no means one of Schumann’s greatest, into something very special indeed.

4/20/2022,"In 2014, one of the first and most celebrated sound systems of the UK’s rave era marked 25 years in the same way they had started. In a packed out marquee in the idyllic Derbyshire countryside, under the glint of a disco ball, DiY’s co-founders Harry Harrison, Rick “Digs” Down, Simon “DK” Smith and Pete “Woosh” Birch united under the groove of house music to throw their last free party together. “It went on and on through to Sunday,” says Harrison. “It was fantastic but very messy. The police turned up. It was proper DiY, like the old days.” This quartet of inveterate ravers – and a wider party crew of around 100 active members – spent those old days creating dance music events that bridged two kindred yet separate worlds: the outdoor free parties that were much maligned by police and the press, and the new urban clubbing scene that exploded in their wake. DiY’s story has now been chronicled in a book by Harrison called Dreaming in Yellow, named in honour of an audaciously trippy track made by Smith and Birch, who died in 2020 after a five-year battle with cancer. “I’d known him since I was 15,” Harrison says. “We were the musical-theoretical-political duo at the heart of it all, really.” Harrison, Birch and co founded DiY following the two acid house “summers of love” in 1988 and 1989, convinced that they were going to change the world. “I think we did, a bit,” Harrison declares. “We had discovered a way of moving barriers between north and south, black and white, gay and straight, men and women.” They would use the crew’s own cultural diversity – squatters and students, travellers and townies, fashionistas and football lads – as a statement: if we can work (and party) together, then so can you. “House was a feeling that ran deep in all of us,” says Emma Kirby, a traveller who became DiY’s first female DJ. “Most travellers and city clubbers united with no prejudices. We were all accepting of each other.” “DiY put themselves on the line for dance music,” says Matthew Collin, author of Altered State, an authoritative history of rave. “They were trying to do something idealistic in the hedonistic world of dance culture.” For Collin, sound systems like DiY – itinerant units that threw unlicensed parties in fields, quarries and other outdoor spaces – represented a radical revolt against the state and the increased infringement on personal liberties in the UK that began with police violence against the travelling community at free festivals in the 70s and 80s, and calcified during the rave era at the turn of the 90s. As Harrison points out in his book, DiY’s politics were “based on hedonism as much as protest, dancing as much as discussion”. DiY’s story played out in those ungoverned fields and quarries, and the catalyst was Glastonbury’s last free festival on the Travellers Field in 1990. The crew had been attending since 1985 and by the summer of 1990, DiY’s budding DJs had thrown a few house parties and club nights in Nottingham. They didn’t have a sound system yet, just enthusiasm and DJ gear, which they loaded into a van. They would end up taking over Hawkwind’s pyramid-shaped marquee in the free zone, battling with bands to play some of Glastonbury’s earliest iterations of dance music. “Glastonbury was our pivotal moment,” says Harrison. “We were there in the Pyramid and we were blessed by the KLF. That’s some pretty strong magic!” When Kirby started DJing under her first name for DiY, she returned to her teenage love of hip-hop and electro; Rick “Digs” Down leaned into disco and funk, and he and Pete “Woosh” Birch quickly became a formidable DJ duo with their Served Chilled brand. Simon “DK” Smith was DiY’s proper house head, who would rather buy records than food. Harrison, meanwhile, was “an indie kid at heart” who quit DJing after three disastrous attempts. His book is littered with colourful anecdotes, such as Bez, eyes popping out of his head, staring down a horse in the pyramid marquee at Glastonbury 1990, or DiY DJ Pezz impersonating Sasha when the soon to be superstar DJ gets detained by snow. When DiY hosted a night at the Haçienda, which is where they had been turned on to house music in the first place, the crew were ejected after a member was caught smoking weed, and the DJs were personally booted off the decks by their boyhood heroes, Tony Wilson and Peter Hook. DiY were invited back, only to be kicked out again for trashing the VIP room, causing the club’s head of security to brandish them, Harrison says, “worse than the Happy Mondays”. Harrison is careful to couch DiY’s shenanigans in their social and political context. Another pivotal moment in his book is Castlemorton, the notorious week-long free festival that took place in Worcestershire in May 1992. DiY’s devotion to house music, alongside the likes of John Coltrane, De La Soul and George Clinton, made them stand out from the rest of the “nosebleed techno” sound systems such as Spiral Tribe that had coalesced in this quaint corner of England. The book begins with Harrison and Birch gazing down at the site on the first night, which Harrison describes as “some giant military operation, or perhaps a huge, dark creature with endless rows of bright white eyes”. “Castlemorton was probably the best PR we ever did,” Harrison says now, given the popularity of their tent – and the high-profile fallout from the event. The local MP Michael Spicer claimed the free party crews had “combined to terrorise the local community to the extent that some residents had to undergo psychiatric treatment”, and the furore led to the 1994 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act (CJA) that criminalised unlicensed events playing music characterised by “the emission of a succession of repetitive beats”. In the book Harrison describes the CJA as “madness, both laughable and sinister”. Reflecting on it now, he adds: “There were bits in the CJA that were worse than the rave bit: it abolished the centuries-old right to silence upon arrest, it privatised prisons, it introduced DNA swabs and adult sentencing for juveniles.” The years between Castlemorton and the CJA passing into law galvanised DiY. They teamed up with other Midlands sound systems to form the activist group All Systems No!, raising around £50,000 to fight the CJA. They subsidised buses down to London to attend a series of protest marches in 1994 with “quite a lot of them ending in comic circumstances”, says Harrison, as when DiY members (Harrison included) stripped naked to join the other politicised party-goers dancing in the fountains of Trafalgar Square during the first “Kill the Bill” demo. Harrison ended up in a police cell that day – not for the first time – and he alleges he was assaulted by riot officers. “We were never going to win but we certainly gave it a good go and had a laugh doing it,” he says, “and if DiY had an epitaph, that’s pretty much it.” The dichotomy between social anger and hedonistic indulgence started to collapse as one impulse superseded the other. Harrison’s drug references throughout Dreaming in Yellow are frequent and candid; what’s missing are the darker consequences of DiY’s – and indeed, the rave generation’s – ubiquitous drug use. “We lost people to the darkness,” admits Harrison. “A lot became addicts and are still addicts. A lot of people are clean. I went to rehab myself in 2008.” Harrison now works as a counsellor for people with substance use issues. “Stick to what you know,” he laughs, but then becomes serious. “As the rave generation, we burned ourselves out, and the four of us at the heart of it definitely sacrificed our sanity for the sake of DiY.” Harrison and Birch had a huge falling out in 1997, Harrison moved to San Francisco and DiY “was never quite the same again”. (The pair made up a decade later when Harrison returned to the UK.) “Digs”, now known as Grace Sands, is the only really active DJ from the collective: a key figure in the queer London scene with a residency at the cult NYD party Adonis, who regularly plays Glastonbury for Block 9’s NYC Downlow. Since Birch’s death, the crew have officially disbanded. Is this really the end? “We never really stopped being DiY,” Harrison concludes. “It wasn’t like working for Tesco. It wasn’t a lifestyle choice for us – it has been a lifelong mission to change the world through quality music, comradeship and above all, love. You can never kill a state of mind. The mission continues.”  Dreaming in Yellow: The Story of DiY Sound System is out now, published by Velocity Press",Arts/Music,90s rave crew DiY Sound System: ‘We definitely sacrificed our sanity’,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/19/90s-rave-crew-diy-sound-system-interview-we-sacrificed-our-sanity
4/20/2022,"Joe Biden has told Barack Obama he will run for re-election in 2024, according to a Washington website, the Hill. The site cited two anonymous sources. One was quoted as saying Biden “wants to run and he’s clearly letting everyone know”. It was not clear when Biden told Obama his plans. But Obama visited the White House earlier this month, to celebrate the Affordable Care Act. Introducing his host, Obama called him “Vice-President Biden”. “That was a joke,” he said, to laughter. Biden was vice-president to Obama from 2009 to 2017. He won the presidency on his own third attempt in 2020 (after short-lived campaigns in 1988 and 2008), beating Donald Trump. At 78, Biden was the oldest president ever inaugurated. If he won again he would be 82 at the start of his second term. Amid competing crises, from the Russian invasion of Ukraine to the coronavirus and rampant inflation at home, Biden’s approval ratings have plummeted. Most observers expect Republicans to retake Congress in November. But the president has dropped plenty of hints that he does plan to run again. In September, it was widely reported that Biden and aides had told allies he planned to run again. In December, Biden said he would run if he stayed in good health. He has also said Kamala Harris, his vice-president, would be on the ticket again. In his December interview with ABC News, Biden said another Trump candidacy would “increase the prospect of running”. In Brussels in March, Biden referred to Trump again when he said: “In the next election, I’d be very fortunate if I had that same man running against me.” Trump, 75, is readying his own third run for the presidency. One of the sources who spoke to the Hill said Biden “thinks he’s the only one who can beat Trump. I don’t think he thinks there’s anyone in the Democratic party who can beat Trump and that’s the biggest factor.” In 2020, Biden surged to victory in the Democratic primary on the back of support from Black voters – and a quickly gathering sense that he was indeed the party’s best hope of beating Trump. According to books and reportage about the 2020 campaign, Obama doubted whether Biden could win. Edward-Isaac Dovere, author of Battle for the Soul: Inside the Democrats’ Campaigns to Defeat Trump, reports: “Obama was doubtful about [Biden’s] prospects. He didn’t think Biden could be a disciplined enough candidate.” Dovere also says Obama doubted Biden’s stamina for the race, was not sure he had the requisite “swagger” for an American president, and worried his vice-president had “trouble … connecting with crowds”. But Dovere also quotes Jen Psaki, now Biden’s White House press secretary, as saying Obama “undervalued Biden’s political abilities because they had such different styles”.",News/US news,Joe Biden told Barack Obama he will run again in 2024 – report,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/19/joe-biden-run-again-2024-report
4/20/2022,"Asda’s private equity owner has claimed the value of its investment in the supermarket chain has soared by nearly 20 times as it gears up for a potential bid for the pharmacy chain Boots. The London-based TDR Capital said its stake as co-owner of the grocer was now worth €1.7bn (£1.4bn) on paper, or 19.8 times its original investment, indicating that the finance group put in just over £70m of fresh cash to back the deal, according to documents seen by the Financial Times. The presentation to investors paints a rosy picture of TDR’s investment in Asda as it gears up to potentially raise more funds to back a £6bn buyout of Boots. It is one of four interested parties in the British retailer. The details behind the claim are not clear, as TDR put in an estimated £390m of equity in total to back the £6.8bn buyout of Asda, the same amount as its partners the Issa brothers. Industry insiders said the £70m of fresh investment in the Asda buyout indicated by TDR’s documents could have been supplemented by proceeds from other investments including EG Group, the petrol forecourts business it also owns in partnership with the Issa brothers. Analysts said they were skeptical of the raised valuation of Asda indicated by the documents. One said: “Asda’s performance has been really weak in the market according to [research firm] Kantar. It has structural issues with its less customers more squeezed by the rising cost of living. The question is could they sell it at this price? I think they would struggle to sell it for ages.” The value of TDR’s stake was thought to have been increased partly to reflect the £7bn buyout of Morrisons in October, which valued that chain at a higher amount relative to core earnings than the original Asda deal. However, Morrisons recently warned that its profits were likely to take a significant hit this year as the cost of living crisis and disruption because of the war in Ukraine weigh on the grocery market. The UK’s biggest supermarket chain, Tesco, also warned of “significant uncertainties” at its annual results last week as its customers tighten their belts to cope with rising inflation.

4/20/2022,"Civil service unions have condemned a “vindictive” move by efficiency minister Jacob Rees-Mogg to name and shame Whitehall departments with the highest rates of working from home as part of a new drive to encourage staff back to the office. Rees-Mogg has circulated a league table of all 16 Whitehall departments’ office occupancy in an attempt to end civil servants working from home. The Department for Education topped Rees-Mogg’s working from home league table with 25% of staff coming into the office at the start of April. It was followed by the Department for Work and Pensions at 27%, and the Foreign Office at 33%. The figures for the first working week of April were attached to a letter to all permanent secretaries urging them to encourage staff back into the office. Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA representing senior civil servants, reacted with fury to the letter and the league table. He said: “It’s ludicrous that civil servants are being counted with clickers. Ministers should be concentrating on what’s being delivered, not numbers at desks.” The general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), Mark Serwotka, said: “These comments from Jacob Rees-Mogg and his Conservative colleagues are a slap in the face to PCS members who worked tirelessly and who made immense sacrifices during the pandemic. “For over two years, often under the government’s own instruction, many of our members have demonstrated that they can do their job from home. The suggestion that they’ve been ‘sitting at home’ is deeply insulting. “The government rightly lauded our members when it mattered. Now they seek to denigrate and offend them. Instead, they should embrace the benefits of hybrid working and make good on their promise to build back better.” The most occupied Whitehall office in Rees-Mogg’s table was the Department for International Trade at 73%, followed by the Department of Health and Social Care on 72%. In his letter, Rees-Mogg argued that ending working from home would bring the benefits of “face-to-face, collaborative working”. It said: “I urge you to issue a clear message to civil servants in your department to ensure a rapid return to the office.” Downing Street also repeated Rees-Mogg’s call for civil servants to return to the office. A spokesman for Boris Johnson said: “Clearly the prime minister feels that it is important that we make best use of taxpayer-funded departments which are not returning, currently, to the levels we saw before the pandemic. “This is not simply just about value-for-money for taxpayer-funded buildings, but also it’s a benefit to the staff – particularly junior staff who benefit from face-to-face working – and obviously we know there are benefits that can help, therefore, delivery for the public as well.” Penman accused Rees-Mogg of behaving like a luddite while the private sector had embraced the benefits of flexible working. In a statement Penman added: “There is no rationale for this. Ministers can’t point to productivity losses, which is why it’s always anonymous sources making the insulting accusations.” “Ministers’ obsession with ending flexible working and micro-managing the civil service increasingly just looks vindictive. “Jacob Rees-Mogg is the minister for government efficiency, yet that isn’t even a consideration in his correspondence with ministers. “The private sector has embraced hybrid working, recognising the efficiencies it delivers and competitive edge it gives to employers in a tight labour market. “Meanwhile, the luddites in cabinet insist on micro-managing the civil service, which will only deter good people from joining while simultaneously demotivating those already there.” Rees-Mogg was backed by the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, who said it was “a very good thing” for people to be back in the workplace. “There’s something different about that face-to-face interaction,” he told Times Radio. “I think anybody who’s been missing that recognises that, but there’s also the issue, particularly for new staff and younger staff, about being able to become part of a team and get to know their colleagues. “Actually, that doesn’t work in a virtual world. You need to be in an office to be able to learn from others to work with others and get to know each other, so I think people being back in the workplace is a very good thing.” A government spokesperson said: “Ministers have been clear that departments should make maximum use of office space and progress is being monitored.”",News/Politics,Civil service unions condemn Rees-Mogg’s ‘vindictive’ back-to-office drive,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/19/civil-service-unions-condemn-rees-moggs-vindictive-back-to-office-drive
4/20/2022,"Hundreds of Ukrainians are believed to be living and working informally in Britain after escaping from farms they were working at, with many claiming to have been subjected to conditions of modern slavery. Ukrainians made up by far the largest proportion of workers in the UK on seasonal worker visas in 2021. Of the 29,631 visas issued under the T5 seasonal work scheme, two-thirds (19,920) were given to Ukrainians. The Scottish Refugee Council estimates there are up to 6,000 Ukrainians in the UK. The farm workers are not eligible for the two main government schemes that support Ukrainian refugees – the family scheme and the community sponsorship scheme. From 3 May, the Ukraine extension scheme will be open for applications. This will allow people to stay for three years and switch to a different visa route, allowing them to seek alternative employment. However, it does not apply to those not working on farms at the time applications are made whose visas expired on or before 31 December 2021. Those whose visas expired on or after 1 January 2022 can apply for the new extension scheme even if they have left the farm. The Guardian has spoken to one Ukrainian worker who is in a state of acute distress about her situation after fleeing conditions on farms that she said were “akin to modern-day slavery”. She is an IT expert with two university degrees and came to the UK with her partner, who has almost finished his training to become a doctor, in the hope of earning money. She has provided an account almost 3,000 words long to the Work Rights Centre, a charity that helps migrants to access employment justice. It details appalling working conditions on the farms she and her partner worked on from August 2021 until they escaped in January. She and her partner are now doing cleaning and construction work jobs respectively in the underground economy. “We have come across many, many other Ukrainians who, like us, have run away from farms, cannot return to Ukraine and so have been forced to work here illegally,” she said. “I feel like I am a hostage in the UK. My parents have told me I must not go back to Ukraine under any circumstances because our city is being shelled. I feel trapped.” She added: “Nobody cares what happens to seasonal workers. I thought our rights would be well protected in the UK but this has not happened. Working on the farm is probably one of the worst experiences and worst treatment of my life.” She and her boyfriend worked on a cherry farm, where they were not allowed to wear gloves, leading to their hands bleeding and skin beginning to peel off. She said workers on one farm staged a protest over the poor conditions and were punished by being suspended for a week. “They set unachievable targets,” she said. “Through threats and humiliation, people were forced to work tirelessly wearing off the skin on their hands and feet until it bleeds. If a person fell off a stepladder they were sent to the campsite to recover on their own or flew home.” On the huge farm workers’ campsite she and her partner were living on, all but 38 workers fled. She said: “People left to work illegally in the cities in order to solve their financial problems and protect their wellbeing. I will never go to work on any of the farms again – there are no happy stories. Everyone runs away.” A review by the Home Office and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) published at the end of last year found that seasonal workers on a post-Brexit pilot scheme launched in 2019 to harvest fruit and vegetables were subjected to “unacceptable” welfare conditions. Issues cited by some workers included a lack of health and safety equipment, racism, and accommodation without bathrooms, running water or kitchens. Graham O’Neill, the policy manager at the Scottish Refugee Council, said: “It is dreadful that hundreds of Ukrainians here, worried sick about family, friends and war crimes at home, now find themselves destitute, their seasonal visas expired due to having to flee conditions on farms.” He called on the home secretary to give seasonal workers the right to remain in the UK and bring family members to safety here. Dr Dora-Olivia Vicol, the director of the Work Rights Centre, said: “I’m extremely concerned for the safety of Ukrainians who had to flee exploitative work conditions on British farms and have since become undocumented.” She said many had resorted to working precariously in the underground economy. “The Home Office should acknowledge that the war in Ukraine is a humanitarian crisis, and offer protection to all Ukrainians in the UK, documented or otherwise,” she said. A government spokesperson said: “Ukrainians on seasonal worker visas can apply for three years’ leave under the Ukraine extension scheme. Under no circumstances should any seasonal workers in the agricultural sector be forced to work in exploitative conditions. We strongly advise any people in these circumstances to report issues to the police so steps can be taken for their safeguarding and wellbeing.”",News/UK news,Ukrainian workers flee ‘modern slavery’ conditions on UK farms,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/19/ukrainian-workers-flee-modern-slavery-conditions-on-uk-farms

Against a gloomy soundscape of crashing waves and beeping boat signals, staggering facts flash up on the screen, stating the numbers of Libyan refugees who have died or gone missing at sea as they attempt to escape from their war-torn country and detention camps to Europe. Meanwhile, Lifeline, a civilian ship that carries out rescue missions for refugees, has been impounded on the coast of Malta for months, as its captain Claus-Peter Reisch endures fines and charges of commanding an improperly registered ship. Exposing how the arduous legal ordeal is a red herring in a political unwillingness to aid refugees, the film documents the inspiring resilience with which Reisch and his crew maintain the day-to-day operation of Lifeline while seeking legislative changes to allow government-sanctioned aid for refugees stranded at sea. At one point, Lifeline supporters hand out leaflets during the festive season to holiday shoppers; the matter-of-fact scenes of seasonal jollity feel especially heartbreaking when, right on their doorsteps, the same simple luxury is denied to displaced Libyan refugees.

4/20/2022,"Some of the largest, most profitable companies in retail and food services are still paying most of their workers less than $15 an hour, and many still make less than $10 an hour, according to a new company wage tracker developed by the Economic Policy Institute and the Shift Project. The tracker, which covers 66 large retail and food service corporations, found: Dollar General pays 92% of workers less than $15 an hour and 22% are paid less than $10 an hour. McDonald’s pays 89% of its workers less than $15 an hour and 23% are paid less than $10 an hour. Wendy’s pays 87% of workers less than $15 an hour and 17% are paid less than $10 an hour. At Sonic, 85% of workers are paid less than $15 an hour and 22% less than $10 an hour. Similarly high percentages were found at Arby’s, Burger King, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut. The report was released as many of these firms have complained about being unable to find staff. Some fast-food firms, such as In and Out Burger, pay much more, with the majority of their workers paid at least $16 an hour and just 9% below $15 an hour. Bill Thompson of Independence, Missouri, has worked at Burger King for 10 years, but makes just $11.15 an hour and has received wage increases only from state minimum wage increases. “I work 40 hours or more a week, 10 hours a day, no breaks,” said Thompson, who has been involved in organizing with the Fight for $15 and a union movement. “The toll on my health has been significant. I can’t afford to see a doctor and when I have a health condition, I have to rely on emergency room services. Many days, I just work through it because there is no paid sick leave and I work paycheck to paycheck.” In 2021, Thompson had to take six weeks off, all unpaid, while his mother was dying of cancer in hospice care at home. He had to rely on local food pantries to keep food in her house through her final days. “This is America, but no one should live like this,” Thompson said. More than half of workers at Dunkin’ Donuts, Starbucks, Chick-Fil-A, Domino’s, IHop, GameStop, Chipotle, Jimmy John’s, Best Western, Bath & Body Works, Cracker Barrel, Gap, Food Lion, Kohl’s, Hannaford, Lowe’s, Marriott, Marshalls, Meijer, Michaels, Panera Bread, Papa John’s, Publix, Rite Aid, Ross, Speedway, Stop & Shop, Subway, Tractor Supply Co, Victoria’s Secret, Waffle House, Walgreens, Walmart and Wyndham Hotels & Resorts are paid less than $15 an hour. The majority of workers at all 66 firms included in the project are paid $20 an hour or less, representing at least 10.7 million workers. The federal minimum wage in the US has remained $7.25 an hour since 2009, while a living wage in the US as calculated by MIT was set at $16.54 an hour for a family of four with two working adults in 2019. According to a 2021 report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a worker needs to make at least $20.40 an hour to afford the rent of the average one-bedroom apartment in the US. Daniel Schneider, co-director of the Shift Project, a joint project at Harvard Kennedy School and University of California, San Francisco, who co-developed the wage tracker, explained the tracker was created to help fill a data hole in not just the average wages at top retail and food service firms, but insight into the distribution of those wages. “None of these firms are transparent when it comes to wages, which is why we found the need to put this data out there. It’s very hard to find any public information from firms about how much they pay their workers, let alone on the distributions of those wages,” said Schneider. He also noted that in addition to the low wages many of these firms pay, the job quality is poor in terms of the lack of benefits, paid time off, erratic scheduling and insufficient hours. “That’s not just low pay, it’s a recipe for material hardship. That’s an economic context that can lead workers to not being able to afford enough to eat or keep up with utility bills,” he said. “There’s a long way to go for most of the employers on this list when it comes to job quality. But the data really shows that there is a higher road strategy available to employers, if they’re willing to take it.” These corporations generate billions of dollars in revenue annually and pay CEOs and executives multimillion-dollar salaries every year. Todd Vasos, CEO of Dollar General, received compensation worth $16.4m in 2021 and McDonald’s CEO, Christopher Kempczinski, received compensation worth $20m. The data on wages were compiled from more than 20,000 workers at the 66 corporations included in the tracker, with an average of 317 respondents for each company, with interviews conducted between March 2021 and November 2021.",News/US news,Most workers at large retail and food firms get less than $15 an hour – study,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/19/how-much-retail-food-companies-pay-workers-per-hour
4/20/2022,"One of the most important works of Handel’s Italian period, La Resurrezione was first performed privately, on Easter Day in 1708, in the house of one of the composer’s Roman patrons. It’s a remarkable piece in some ways. The subject in itself is unusual: depictions of the resurrection are comparatively rare in music, as indeed they are in art, almost as if approaching the central mystery of Christianity were in some ways at the limits of human imagination. Handel’s treatment is oblique, albeit striking. A supernatural colloquy between Lucifer and an Angel describes the harrowing of hell, while on Earth, saints John the Evangelist, Mary Magdalene and Mary Cleophas anxiously await the dawn that will reveal Christ’s tomb to be empty. As so often in Handel, however, there is an underlying sense of God’s glory reflected in the physical wonder of creation, and the textual equation of Christ with the sun paves the way for an astonishingly beautiful depiction of natural renewal after the harshness of winter. The resulting sensuous immediacy very much predominated in Easter Monday’s performance by the London Handel Orchestra under Laurence Cummings, part of both the London Handel festival and the Easter festival at St Martin-in-the-Fields. Cummings proved an exacting judge of the sometimes tricky balance between drama and reflection, teasing out instrumental detail as he went – the woodwind that alternately grieve and console, the warmth in the strings, the gleam in the brass that eventually heralds the triumph of light over darkness. There was some wonderful singing, too. Nardus Williams sounded ravishing as Mary Magdalene, her rapt introspection contrasted with the bravura brilliance of Helen Charlston’s Mary Cleophas. Rachel Redmond’s Angel showered Callum Thorpe’s sullen, gritty-voiced Lucifer with volleys of gleefully precise coloratura. And as John the Evangelist, Ed Lyon sang with burnished tone and deep sincerity, bringing an ecstatic quality to Ecco Il Sol Ch’Esce Dal Mare that arguably made it the emotional high point of a fine and rewarding evening.",Arts/Music,La Resurrezione review – wonderful singing takes Handel into the ecstatic,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/19/la-resurrezione-review-st-martin-in-the-fields-london-handel
4/20/2022,"As the curtain came down on Napoli’s 1-1 draw with Roma, Lorenzo Insigne turned and booted a water bottle back toward his bench. His body language spoke less of rage than resignation. The player’s hopes of leaving his boyhood club with a Serie A title as a parting gift had already dimmed with defeat to Fiorentina in the previous round. Still, this was a day that could have belonged to him. Insigne’s well-taken penalty put Napoli ahead for 80 minutes. A win would at least have kept them in touching distance of the summit. Instead, someone else had taken hold of the narrative. Not Stephan El Shaarawy, who scored the injury-time equaliser – firing past Alex Meret at the end of a scintillating move, in which nine Roma players touched the ball and the last five only once each – but an inevitable José Mourinho. The manager had made headlines before kick-off, when he went to lay flowers at the shrine to Diego Maradona in Naples’s Spanish Quarter. Mourinho has spoken before about their friendship, telling BT Sport how the Argentinian used to call him after defeats but never wins. Their conversations would have been few, if Maradona were still with us, in 2022. Mourinho’s Roma have lost only twice since 9 January and one of those hardly counts – a 2-1 defeat in the first-leg of their Europa Conference League quarter-final with Bodo Glimt, overturned by a 4-0 victory in Thursday’s return. They are unbeaten in 12 Serie A matches, the longest ongoing run in the division. At the start of the year, questions were being asked about what Mourinho had done to justify Roma’s decision to hire him and pay him the joint-best salary in the league. His team were 11 points worse off than at the corresponding stage last season. Despite a summer transfer spend of more than €100m, Mourinho responded to a 6-1 thrashing by Bodo Glimt in the Conference League group stage by saying he had only “12 or 13” players worthy of the team. The last three months have turned the story on its head, Roma improving so drastically as to give themselves an outside shot at a Champions League spot. A win over Napoli on Sunday would have pulled them to within three points of Juventus in fourth. Mourinho has adapted his tactics, showing greater willingness to press opponents high and play on the front foot. He has made changes to how individual players are used, notably bringing Nicolò Zaniolo in from the wing to operate more often as a second striker behind Tammy Abraham – even if there had still been media laments about the Italian’s lack of playing time before a hat-trick in Thursday’s win over Bodo Glimt. 🛣️ 𝐆𝐎𝐀𝐋: This is the way 💁🏻‍♂️ #NapoliRoma #SerieA 💎 @ASRomaEN @OfficialEl92 pic.twitter.com/d4zp7M9UQy Most of all, though, Mourinho’s greatest success might have been to achieve something that eluded him in recent stints at Manchester United and Tottenham: persuading players to buy in. Roma’s defining trait over the last three-and-a-half months has not been dazzling football – though there have been flashes of that – but simply a refusal to quit. El Shaarawy’s strike was the Giallorossi’s seventh injury-time goal of this season and their 15th inside the last quarter-hour of a game. Against last-placed Salernitana in their previous league game, they trailed until the 82nd minute before recovering to win. Lorenzo Pellegrini’s equaliser against Udinese last month arrived in the 93rd. Abraham earned a win over Spezia with a penalty in the 98th. That tenacity was in evidence again as they fought to stay in Sunday’s game despite a rocky start. Napoli looked far sharper in the opening exchanges, Mario Rui overlapping effectively with Insigne down the left and Hirving Lozano carving through the lines on the right. It was the Mexican who won the penalty with a run beyond Ibañez, who caught his heel in a rush to recover. Milan 2-0 Genoa, Spezia 1-3 Inter, Lazio 1-1 Torino, Juventus 1-1 Bologna, Fiorentina 1-0 Venezia, Udinese 4-1 Empoli, Sampdoria 1-2 Salernitana, Cagliari 1-0 Sassuolo, Atalanta 1-2 Verona, Napoli 1-1 Roma Yet Roma gave up few clear-cut chances beyond that, and might have had goals of their own on the counter if Zaniolo had shown just a little more clarity of thought – holding the ball when he should have squared it for Abraham and looking for a pass when he appeared to have a chance to go beyond wrong-footed defenders on his own. Through the second half, Roma only got stronger. Abraham should have equalised but made a poor connection on a close-range header. Napoli invited them on, Luciano Spalletti withdrawing first Lozano and Fabián Ruiz, then Insigne and Victor Osimhen. El Shaarawy’s goal arrived late, but it felt more than deserved. Mourinho’s praise for his players at full-time was embedded into an extended lament about perceived refereeing injustice. His argument that the Napoli full-back Alessandro Zanoli could have been sent off for a pair of reckless challenges felt justified. The claim that Roma should have had a penalty when Zaniolo collided with Meret was more ambiguous. The keeper made an excellent save in the first instance but then collided with the striker, who perhaps could have reached the ball otherwise. “It seemed impossible to me to leave here with a positive result, even though my team did not just play well but extremely well,” said Mourinho. “After Thursday’s game, and against a great team like Napoli, this match seemed like Everest, but we had quality, character, physical and mental conditioning that were absolutely incredible. We wanted more, but it was impossible. In football both teams have the right to play to win matches, whether they are fighting for the Scudetto, fifth place or to avoid relegation. This time they took that right away from us.” Opinions will differ on individual decisions but might also be beside the point. Mourinho was leaning into his players’ sense of injustice, just as he has at previous clubs, to bond them together, selling them a story about ‘us against the world’. That approach has been enthusiastically received in Rome from the start. Mourinho was popular with fans even before results started to turn in his team’s favour. A surge up the table and a push to the semi-final of a European competition – even if not the most glamorous one – is welcomed as vindication by those who believed from the start. On Saturday Roma go away to Inter, the team with whom Mourinho won the Treble in 2010 and who now sit second in the table – two points behind their neighbours Milan with a game in hand. He may not be in the running for a Scudetto of his own, but once again the Portuguese finds himself holding a quill as the final chapter of a Serie A season is committed to the page.",Sport/Football,Roma on the rise as Mourinho’s ‘us against the world’ mentality pays off | Nicky Bandini,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/19/roma-on-the-rise-as-jose-mourinho-us-against-the-world-mentality-pays-off-serie-a
4/20/2022,"Spoiler alert: this recap is for people watching Better Call Saul season six, which airs on Netflix in the UK. Do not read on unless you have watched episodes one and two. Welcome to the Guardian’s recaps of the final season of Better Call Saul. This late addition to the golden age of TV finishes in 2022 after seven years, a pandemic and a near-death experience for its star. The final 13 episodes will be shown in two blocks between now and July and we start with a double bill – Wine and Roses followed by Carrot and Stick – both of which are discussed here. I hope you enjoy and, as ever, these recaps work best when there is engaged and informed commentary above and below the line, so please do get stuck in. We’ll get to Jimmy and Kim soon enough but, in these opening episodes, the heat is to be found in the desert. Nacho Varga (Michael Mando) is as on the run as a man can be: literally dashing for miles through the scrub to try to escape the consequences of his actions. He thinks he’s hiding from the responsibility of killing Lalo Salamanca. We know he’s actually being chased by the man himself. Nacho finally holes up in the decrepit Motel Ocotillo after bundling over a wall and taking silent receipt of some keys from a landlady who’s seen it all before and has a creaking rocking chair. From there, Nacho begins several days of increasing paranoia, and with good reason. Having survived his assassination attempt, the inexorable Lalo (Tony Dalton) appears to be of the mind that revenge is a dish best served cold. On escaping the bloodbath he visits a family friend and cajoles him into shaving off his beard, before killing him so he can double as his corpse on the crime scene. (At least, that was my reading of it.) With his death confirmed, Lalo can take his time. He has not just Nacho but Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito) in his sights and chooses to turn down a trip across the US border in a hay bale to take time to do things properly and find prueba of the Chicken Man’s involvement in the botched hit. We don’t see all that much of Lalo in the first two episodes, which only heightens the menace. There’s certainly enough to get Nacho jumping at shadows, until those shadows become real people with singsong voices sitting in an abandoned hut and staking him out for Fring. He, via Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), has also tipped the cartel off as to Nacho’s whereabouts, all of which predictably ends up in an exchange of hot lead under the noonday sun. But Nacho survives, even blasting his way through the unusually lethargic-looking Cousins, as he busts out of the motel compound to go on the run once more. Back in Albuquerque, Fring doesn’t believe Lalo is dead and doesn’t care if Nacho is alive or dead. Mike is testing Fring’s patience to the limit by not only offering to pick up Nacho from the desert but refusing to offer up the kid’s honest ol’ papa as a sacrifice. Last thing we see, Mike’s phone goes and it’s Nacho wanting to speak to Fring. A monosyllabic conversation with multiple layers of hidden menace seems likely to follow. And so, to our hero. And our heroine. A couple who are ever more intertwined and occasionally interchangeable. Gone are the days of Jimmy slippy, Kim squeaky clean, or at least it appears that way. They are both four square behind a plan to liberate the Sandpiper settlement money via the mechanism of destroying Howard’s career (see below), and they’re also both dipping liberally into a bag of cartel cash to cover costs. At the same time, Kim is buzzing over her work in the pro-bono sector and Jimmy isn’t keeping any secrets. What are we to make of that? Well, as much as everyone is looking forward to the arrival of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman in their own prequel, the resolution of Kim and Jimmy’s relationship is the big uncertain plot line of this final season. Kim’s not in Breaking Bad, so where does she go? Is she killed, betrayed, disillusioned? Or does she just keepherself to herself while Saul Goodman does Fring’s bidding for a few years? Could Gene Takovic even be cohabiting? I await the outcome with great trepidation, especially because she and Jimmy look as thick as thieves. Betsy and Craig Kettleman are dragged from their peaceable lives diddling pensioners out of tax rebates to become an essential cog in Jimmy and Kim’s big howard conspiracy in the second episode, Carrot and Stick. First appearing in season one, the family of embezzlers served as an example of Jimmy’s nose for taking on cases that are morally dubious but potentially lucrative. They also featured recently in a pre-season clip, professing their probity in a nicely sleazy 60 Minutes style mockumentary clip that is not only a bit kitsch, but is voiced by Stacy Keach). A couple of years since we last saw them, the couple remain anything but the decent hardworking people they make themselves out to be. They’re running a tax scam for a start. But the actual facts are of secondary importance to how the Kettlemans, and wife, Betsy, in particular, perceive reality – and her pugnacity has always made a good foil for Jimmy’s slippery instincts. Kim and Jimmy’s wheeze is to get Craig, and to a greater extent Betsy, to further peddle the rumour that Howard Hamlin is a cocaine user (one set up in Wine and Roses with an elaborate golf club baggie drop). Only by artfully keeping the information out of Betsy’s greedy reach does Jimmy first pique her interest and, then, once he passes it on, he relies on her hatred for him to act as lubricant to the process. A desire to use Jimmy’s secret against him takes Betsy and Craig straight to the top of Davis & Main, precisely where Jimmy wants them to go, as it was Clifford Main who spotted Howard’s baggie with familiar weariness in episode one. Betsy soon realises she’s been played and even works out Jimmy’s ruse. But Kim bails Jimmy out with her Lalo voice again, and the Kettlemans’ new scam will be exposed to the IRS if Betsy doesn’t shut up. They duly take the hint (and a little sweetener from Jimmy’s desert bag), and the family that has served as a delicious little symbol of the greed that exists outside the normal parameters of the “criminal world” are left to contemplate their choices. There is no Gene Takovic cameo to intro the season. It might be my eyesight but I think the opening shot of a load of ties being put into a government-owned bin transitions from black and white (Gene world) to colour, so maybe that’s a nod, but we appear to currently be denied any further update on what is going on now in Jimmy’s world. Hmmm. In terms of cinematography, we get a lovely bit of gaming footage, first going inside Kaylee’s marble set and then taking a domino eye’s view of one of Nacho’s tweaking girlfriends. The kind of innovative angles that have always been the hallmark of first Breaking Bad and now BCS, they also serve as a counterpoint between the innocence of Kaylee’s world (the protection of which is Mike’s only goal in life) and the damage that’s wreaked on others by the drug trade. Finally, farewell to the “World’s 2nd best lawyer (again)” mug. You weren’t around for long, but you saw a lot. May you finally find peace in that trash can (via some top notch three point shooting from Kim).",Arts/Television & radio,"Better Call Saul recap: season six, episodes one and two – watch out Howard!
