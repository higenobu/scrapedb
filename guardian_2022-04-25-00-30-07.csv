4/25/2022,"Craig Dawson had enjoyed virtually the perfect afternoon. West Ham’s one fit centre-back had been a man mountain, everything thrown at him repelled. The “Ballon D’Orson” flag his own fans had put together was looking apt. Then substitute Romelu Lukaku burst through and, out of desperation, Dawson grabbed his shirt. Down he went, and the penalty was given. A yellow turned red after Michael Oliver consulted the video monitor. Dawson trudged off forlorn. It was not what he deserved. Mercy surely then when Jorginho’s run was stuttered, unconvincing. Some might say, like Chelsea. Lukasz Fabianski made the easiest penalty save of his career. But alas, that was not to be that. The 90 was up when Marcos Alonso burst down the left, crossing for Christian Pulisic to finish. Cruel on West Ham, even more so on Dawson. It ended a run of three straight home defeats, coming, much like their last victory, in the same manner as their last. Chelsea led the league by one when advent started but spent Sunday morning shooting nervous glances over their shoulder at Arsenal. A one time inevitability, needed a little TLC. It came just about. But Thomas Tuchel barely left his seat for the first hour, much of it spent scrawling furiously in his notebook. Dawson’s name may well have been added in biro. New centre-backs, he requires. Andreas Christensen, victim of Stamford Bridge’s difficult pitch midweek, was named to start before withdrawing due to illness. He, alongside Antonio Rüdiger, and perhaps Cesar Azpilicueta, are heading straight outta’ Cobham to La Liga. Malang Sarr is not up to it, while age might even be catching up with Thiago Silva who miscued several clearances. David Moyes on the other hand, until the late drama, had cut largely a relaxed figure, as did Kevin Nolan who spent the entire game bellowing instructions on a white box. The old-school science teacher who does not bother with writing on the board. Their one moment of first-half concern came when Tomas Soucek and Silva clashed heads at a Chelsea corner. The man in blue was straight to his feet, Soucek taking a little longer. Fortunately, he was ok. West Ham’s European exertions have stretched a wafer-thin squad. Six points from eight games, makes them top-four outsiders. Their likeliest Champions League entry route comes via silverware, which Moyes had clearly determined before kick-off. A half-dozen changes with close to a whole eye on Thursday’s Europa League semi-final with Frankfurt. Michail Antonio, Jarrod Bowen and Declan Rice were amongst notable restees. This will hurt but not too much. There was a healthy dollop of pre-season to the afternoon, what with the sunshine and empty seats. And Chelsea were doing their utmost to shape their own downfall, N’Golo Kante’s opening minute sloppiness setting an unwanted tone. Azpilicueta – shifted from right-wing back to the left of a back three, perhaps in part to distance him from the front row – had more the air of nervous debutant than senior pro making, say his 450th club appearance. He dallied too long in a dangerous area and Said Benrahma nicked it off him, advanced into the box, and drew a save, albeit a comfortable one, for Edouard Mendy. Then Ukrainian Andriy Yarmolenko almost marked his first league start in 17 months with the opener, flashing a half-volley wide after a clever diagonal run. Each time Chelsea ventured forward pre-break, they resembled voles blindly bumping into bodies. Timo Werner and Ben Johnson do-si-doed on the edge of the box, the former conceding a free-kick. Kante (what has happened to him?) shot wide early, Ruben Loftus-Cheek rolled a cross-cum-shot tamely at Fabianksi and Kai Havertz’s trickery took him into touch. Tuchel returned to his perch a good few minutes before his players after the break. Understandable; what more could he really say to them? Werner opened the half with a poor lay-off that drew anger. It felt like more of the same. Then, finally, a little life. Werner’s point-blank header, which came following Mason Mount’s quick feet, was blocked by Dawson. Soon after, he blocked Kante’s left-footed shot. Fabianski had to react sharply to hold, having already gone to ground. Chelsea had some wind. When Fabianski was tested again, pushing Trevor Chalobah’s effort from distance wide, Moyes had seen enough; Rice time. Immediately he drew a foul, and Tuchel’s coil finally sprung. Up he jumped, furious. More Chelsea pressure, this time Mount getting a pair of shots away. Who was there to block? Dawson is not a pointless answer. On came the Chelsea cavalry. And this time it worked. What Chelsea crave desperately is certainty. Expectations had been that the Raine Group would announce a preferred bidder this week, but reports Sunday morning suggest an additional stage. And so, smoke continues to billow from Stamford Bridge. It is unclear though, whether the house is burning down or the Phoenix is mid-rise. The pitch, as you asked, was fine.

4/25/2022,"Max Verstappen won the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix with a commanding drive for Red Bull from pole position, with his teammate Sergio Pérez in second. Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc made a costly mistake in the final stages dropping him from third to a sixth-placed finish and allowing Verstappen to take a huge chunk out of his championship lead. McLaren’s Lando Norris took third. The race was one to forget in difficult circumstances for Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes. The seven-time champion started in 14th and finished in the same position in a car that has been an absolute handful to drive all weekend, but his teammate George Russell will take heart in a gutsy fourth. Alfa Romeo’s Valtteri Bottas was in fifth. Verstappen led the way at the Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari, untroubled out front in a flawless run that reaffirmed his place as absolutely still in the title fight with Leclerc. Ferrari could not match the pace of Red Bull and much as Leclerc pushed he was held back with relative ease by Verstappen and Pérez. The win has tightened up the fight for the championship after four rounds with a planned 19 still to go. Leclerc remains leading but Verstappen is in second, now only 27 points back, having been 46 in arrears going into this weekend. On Saturday, after a difficult sprint race in which they made no headway through the field Hamilton conceded any chance they had of fighting for the title had gone. He also intimated that at best Mercedes had to hope there was a solution to the issues plaguing their car. Hamilton is the only F1 driver to have won a race in every season he has competed, since his debut in 2007. After Imola it is a remarkable achievement that is under real threat of coming to an ignominious end this season. He has conceded his previously all-conquering Mercedes team might have made a fundamental mistake in the design of their car. “In Barcelona testing, the question was put to me: ‘What happens if you get it wrong?’ And I said: ‘We don’t do that, we don’t get things wrong, we’re world champions’. But the fact is, with all the possibilities out there, we may have.” Hamilton has said there is no fix in the pipeline and worse still Russell appears to be able to extract more from the car in its current form. This is Verstappen’s 22nd win and his second at Imola, having also won here last year. After suffering the disappointment of being forced to retire in the first round at Bahrain and then at the last meeting in Melbourne, his title charge is now back in full flight, albeit with the task to catch Leclerc remaining a formidable one. The race opened on a wet track after earlier heavy rain and the drivers started on the intermediate wet tyres. Verstappen made a good start from pole but Leclerc was slow away, passed by Pérez and Norris through turn one, where Carlos Sainz was nudged off by Daniel Ricciardo ending his race in the gravel and bringing out the safety car. Russell meanwhile made a superb start and benefiting from the incidents in front, moved from 11th to sixth on the opening lap. Hamilton too moved up two spots to 12th. Racing resumed on lap five, Verstappen holding his lead with his wingman Pérez on his tail. The conditions remained tricky as the track began to try in places as Leclerc was finally able to make a pass on Norris on lap eight but only when Verstappen had already opened up a three-second lead out front. Leclerc was six seconds in arrears while Russell found his Mercedes race pace that has been absent all weekend. All over the back of Kevin Magnussen, after a fine tussle the British driver made it stick on lap 12 to take fifth but Hamilton made no progress from 11th. Verstappen however was in control in front with a five-second lead and seven seconds up on Leclerc. With the track drying Pérez pitted for slick tyres on lap 19, as did the Mercedes drivers. Verstappen and Leclerc followed a lap later, all taking medium rubber but Leclerc’s stop was slow and Pérez passed him on the out lap to reclaim second. Hamilton too dropped places with a slow stop, emerging in 14th. Verstappen was maintaining a solid lead and setting fastest laps at his leisure while Pérez kept Leclerc in check behind him in what had developed into a somewhat processional affair. Hamilton was lapped by Verstappen on lap 41, a moment that will only have brought the unpleasant reality of Mercedes’ place in the pecking order home with brutal reality, as the British driver struggled to so much as pass the AlphaTauri of Pierre Gasly. Ferrari then pitted Leclerc for a late stop to take a shot on the soft tyres but was swiftly matched by Red Bull who pitted Pérez then Verstappen to cover it off. However Ferrari’s gamble went horribly wrong, Leclerc pushed for Pérez but went too hard, spun off at Variante Alta on lap 54 and took front-wing damage forcing him to pit again and dropping him to ninth. A huge unforced error from which he could recover only to sixth as Verstappen romped to victory. Yuki Tsunoda was in seventh for AlphaTauri, Sebastian Vettel in eighth for Aston Martin with his teammate Lance Stroll in 10th. Kevin Magnussen was in ninth for Haas.",Sport/Sport,Verstappen closes gap to Leclerc after easing to Emilia Romagna F1 GP victory,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/24/verstappen-closes-gap-to-leclerc-after-easing-to-emilia-romagna-f1-gp-victory
4/25/2022,"Nineteen years after Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck called off their wedding, the couple have announced they’re engaged. Three couples share their own stories of rekindling their romance after a breakup, and how their relationships have changed. During the first lockdown I was working in Riyadh. Work continued, but any social life there came to an abrupt halt. This prompted me to spend a lot of time on Messenger, reaching out to anyone I saw online for a chat. One of those was the love of my life from university days in Exeter, Sue. We weren’t together long back then – she graduated the year before me, and ran away to the theatre. It was an amicable split, but we’d only seen each other once since, when I took my kids to one of her company’s performances. So, 40 years later, and with two divorces and six kids between us, we started chatting again. We got on tremendously and planned to meet up when I was back in the UK, with no particular agenda. The second lockdown came and I was by this time looking after my poorly mum in her retirement flat in Saffron Walden, so I wouldn’t break any lockdown rules. We did chat every day, though, and now see each other as much as we can. I’m still looking after my mum and working at home, while Sue is a teacher. This summer it will be 40 years since one of our first dates at Glastonbury music festival, so we hope to go to our second festival together – but somewhere a bit more mellow, like Love Supreme on the south coast. And we’re planning to get married. Back in the day, Sue was ambitious to get on in the theatre, which she did, but since having changed career to teaching and nearing retirement, she is more laid back these days – and I’m perhaps a little more mature. We’re enjoying getting to know each much more profoundly and sincerely after our short, youthful relationship. But in terms of our passion and comfort with each other, it’s like picking up where we left off 40 years ago. Nick, 61 and Sue, 62, Saffron Walden I fell in love with Jen very quickly, which is rare for me, but I knew that this was special. It was 2009, I was 44 and she was 38, we had both been married before and had one child each around the same age. We were both very focused on our children and it took a while before we introduced the other to our families, as we were protective and wanted to be sure. We dated for about four-and-a-half years and we never argued. We had disagreements, but never raised our voices or spoke negatively of the other; it was always a relationship based on respect, trust and love. Unfortunately the relationship ended. I bought a house in Norfolk, and wanted Jen to move in with me from east London, but she never did. When I look back, I can understand why. Her daughter was getting ready for her public exams. We could have left it a year or two, but we never really discussed it. I think that was the mistake. We went our separate ways and did not have any contact for six-and-a-half years. Jen did try to contact me a few times, but I’m a stubborn person and felt heartbroken. At the beginning of the pandemic, I had moved back to London and was staying with some friends when Jen texted me again. I was going to delete the number when my friend asked me who it was from. I told him that it was Jen and that I was going to delete the message. He told me not to be so silly; we might be dead tomorrow. We eventually met up once the Covid restrictions were relaxed, and when I saw her, I knew that she was the one for me. My feelings hadn’t changed. Jen felt the same way and we have been seeing each other since then. It’s a different relationship now. Our children are now young adults, and we have the freedom to spend time on us. Russell, 57 and Jennifer, 51, London I met my fiance, James, when I moved into the same house as him during our placement year in 2012, between the second and third year of university. It took us nearly the whole year before we got together. We moved back to our respective universities in Durham and Loughborough and were long distance for a year, before moving to London together. It was a bit quick in retrospect. The pressures of both our full-time studying for a master’s, plus part-time jobs at the weekend and being flat broke proved too much for us and we split. I moved to Belfast to start my PhD and James went to Leeds for his PhD. It wasn’t until a year later that I got a message from James. He thought he had made a massive mistake and wanted to get back together. I agreed to give it a go and he flew to Belfast to talk things over. But I decided that it wasn’t what I wanted; I asked to just be friends. Six months later, we started chatting via text again and I arranged to see him. He told me that he hadn’t moved on, and I found myself surprised that I didn’t want to let him go either. A month of dating later, we made it official and slotted back together, better than before. The time apart had given us the chance to grow up and get better at communicating. Within a year, we were engaged. Now, having both finished our respective PhDs, we have been able to move in together, in the same city, and are happily planning for our wedding next summer.

4/25/2022,"As a psychiatrist, I reserve admission to a mental health hospital bed for only the most unwell patients, whose mental health has collapsed. But despite my very best efforts to keep as many patients as I can out of hospital, bed pressures pervade every aspect of my daily work. The decision about whether or not we can admit a patient with a psychotic relapse who is not eating or drinking, for example, must first be agreed by the trust’s bed-management team. The woeful and worsening scarcity of NHS mental health beds forces psychiatrists to make very difficult judgments about a patient’s need for care and the risk they pose. Acting in the best interests of the patient often seems secondary to the need to manage our hospital’s limited bed capacity. If, after much robust discussion with bed management, I get the green light to admit someone, I immediately become anxious that my patient will be sent to a private sector “overspill” bed, where I can be fairly sure that they will receive much poorer care than they would receive in the NHS. I am not for one moment suggesting that being an inpatient in one of England’s underfunded NHS mental health hospitals is a pleasant experience. Most of our wards are dilapidated. Between six and eight patients share a single bathroom. Decades of underinvestment in mental health trusts is there for all to see. If the government is serious about mental health, it needs to start rebuilding our wards to provide a proper therapeutic environment and greater dignity in the care of our patients. And yet, the quality of care that we provide in the NHS for our most unwell patients is much better than they would receive in the private sector. Over the past 20 years, the NHS has come to rely more and more heavily on the private sector, as our own stock of mental health beds has fallen. This is despite the ever-increasing need and demand for inpatient mental health care. It is a hugely shortsighted policy which has left NHS mental health services at the mercy of companies whose purpose is to make a profit. Many NHS psychiatrists are very concerned about this increasing dependence on the private sector, mainly because the quality of care there is highly variable and also because some private mental health operators use some very questionable practices. The idea that private provision of mental health care is “better” than NHS care is a myth. Countless Care Quality Commission inspection reports have shown that private mental health hospitals suffer from serious staffing problems. The private mental health sector relies heavily on temporary staff, has few full-time psychiatrists of its own and relies heavily on NHS psychiatrists working there one or two days a week. The quality of inpatient therapeutic care is often poor, and the follow-up care after discharge can be nonexistent and badly coordinated with NHS community teams. Once private firms have banked the NHS fees from someone’s stay as an inpatient, they often seem to then forget about the patient, whereas we in the NHS continue to support them for as long as they need. Private beds are sometimes a long way from the patient’s home, family and friends, which is distressing for everyone. I have lost count of the number of families who have complained that their loved ones are in a private hospital far away and that they are therefore unable to visit them. Out-of-area care reduces the support for the patient when they are in hospital, can lead to them staying longer, compromises effective and timely discharge planning and, crucially, reduces their chances of recovery. Private mental health hospitals often seem to hold on to NHS patients for longer than necessary. They have no incentive to discharge patients and are paid to keep their beds filled, with a guaranteed income from the taxpayer. Longer than needed inpatient stays are bad for patients. When an inpatient stay lasts for many months, the person can become institutionalised and deskilled in everyday tasks. Some private hospitals also tell patients what they want to hear. They can agree too readily with the patient’s self-diagnosis. A diagnosis of personality disorder in the NHS often becomes bipolar disorder in the private sector. Again, this seems to be all about filling their beds and boosting their profits. Private care of NHS mental health patients is bad for patients, bad for the NHS and bad for taxpayers. The government needs to face up to this by building more NHS inpatient mental health bed capacity.

4/25/2022,"Democrats need to “get up off our rear ends” and work to bring down prices and runaway inflation, or face wipeout in November’s midterm elections, the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren warns. In a forthright interview Sunday morning on CNN’s State of the Union, the former candidate for her party’s presidential nomination also lambasted the Republican House minority leader Kevin McCarthy as “a liar and a traitor” after he was caught on tape lying about his support for Donald Trump after the 6 January insurrection. McCarthy could become House speaker if Republicans, as polls suggest, win back control of Congress later this year, something Warren said is a worrying possibility. “I think we’re gonna be in real trouble if we don’t get up and deliver,” she said. “I am glad to talk about what we’ve done, obviously, and I think the president deserves real credit, but it’s not enough. We’ve got less than 200 days until the election and American families are hurting. Our job, while we are here in the majority, is to deliver on behalf of those families.” Warren was echoing growing concerns in Democratic circles that, despite Joe Biden’s bipartisan achievements such as the $1.9tn infrastructure bill, the party is losing out in messaging to Republican culture wars over abortion, transgender rights and race. “We can’t just rest on what we’ve already done,” she said. “We need to be fighting going forward. There are things that the American people elected us to do and we still need to get out there and do them.” She added: “We do that then we’re going to be fine in the election. That’s how democracy works, especially when we’re up against a party that just wants to fight culture wars. That’s not gonna help people in their lives. “Our job as Democrats is to help hard working Americans, and we can do that. We can make government work not just for the billionaires, not just for the giant corporations. We can actually make it work for everyone but we need to get up and do it.” Warren said she sees inflation, which this month reached a 40-year high, among the biggest obstacles to Democrats’ prospects in midterms. “Families are paying more at the pump, they’re paying more when they go to the grocery store, they’re paying more when they try to buy a hamburger,” Warren said. “So it’s the responsibility of Congress, of the president, to get out there and make the changes we need to make to bring down those prices for families. “We can do that. We have the tools, but we’ve got to get up off our rear ends and make it happen. Take it to the people what we’ve [already] done, but we need to get the work done.” Warren also delivered probably the most caustic comments yet from a senior Democrat over the McCarthy tapes, which the New York Times published last week. McCarthy, who had strongly denied that he ever said he would seek Trump’s resignation for inciting the 6 January Capitol attack, was caught on video saying just that. “Kevin McCarthy is a liar and a traitor,” Warren said. “This is outrageous. And that is really the illness that pervades the Republican leadership right now, that they say one thing to the American public and something else in private. “What happened was an attempt to overthrow our government and the Republicans instead want to continue to try to figure out how to make the 2020 election [result] different. Shame on Kevin McCarthy.”",News/US news,"‘Get up off our rear ends’ or lose badly in midterms, Elizabeth Warren warns Democrats",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/24/elizabeth-warren-democrats-midterms-warning
4/25/2022,"An Italian train conductor who was sacked for issuing passengers with too many fines said his “nightmare is over” after the country’s top court ruled he was wrongfully dismissed. Francesco Bonanno, 61, was accused of “terrorising” passengers by overzealously handing out a record number of fines within the space of a couple of years as he controlled tickets across northern routes on Trenitalia trains. Trenitalia laid him off in 2017 after receiving a deluge of complaints from unhappy customers, costing it about €10,000 (about £8,500) in reimbursements for fines the company argued had been issued arbitrarily and for mistaken sums. Bonanno, who lives in Jesolo, near Venice, had fined passengers for various infractions, such as boarding a train without a ticket, failing to date-stamp it or for travelling on incorrect routes. He sought legal action and has officially returned to work after the supreme court said he must be “reintegrated” back into the company. The court described the conductor as someone who worked with “uncommon zeal” and was “inflexible”. However, it ruled Bonanno was only doing his job, albeit in an “extremely meticulous way”, and did not seek to profit personally. In an interview with Corriere della Sera, Bonanno, who has been a train conductor for 38 years, denied he was “ruthless” despite admitting to issuing a record 5,000 fines. “I’m not a bounty hunter, but at work you need rigour, and I have to ensure that all passengers travel with a valid ticket,” Bonanno added. “I am never authoritarian or a bully; the passengers love me.” His lawyer, Lucio Spampatti, said he had never heard of someone being fired because they worked too much. “If you think about it, this story is paradoxical. We’re talking about a train conductor, who as a result of discovering passengers without a ticket, earned the company more than €200,000.”",News/World news,"Italian train conductor who issued 5,000 fines wrongfully dismissed, court rules",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/24/italian-train-conductor-who-issued-5000-fines-wrongfully-dismissed-court-rules
4/25/2022,"The structure of the PRS Foundation’s New Music Biennial now seems firmly established. A weekend presenting 20 mostly new works, each nominally lasting just 15 minutes, and each performed twice in an hour-long slot, separated by a platform discussion with the composer and perhaps the performers. The last biennial took place in Hull and London in 2019; Coventry, the current UK city of culture, hosted the new one, which will be repeated at the Southbank Centre in July. This year’s programme celebrates the 10th anniversary of the scheme by including some works from previous biennials, so that there are 10 new scores and 10 revivals, with the usual broad-minded mix of genres and styles. So on the opening night there were two premieres, alongside pieces originally heard in 2014 and 2017. The new works, both performed in Coventry Cathedral, provided the frame. Paul Purgas’s pulsing exploration of the past, present and future of analogue recording techniques, complete with light show, ended an evening that had begun rather unpromisingly with Toby Young’s Breathlines, which at almost 25 minutes easily outstayed its welcome. Written for saxophonist Amy Dickson and the choir and ensemble of the Armonico Consort, and described as something between a concerto and a meditation, Breathlines alternates extracts from a pre-recorded lecture on breathing techniques with anodyne saxophone soliloquies accompanied by baroque strings and wordless voices and occasional halos of electronic sound. It’s intended to create a space of contemplation and invoke positive change; instead there was only impatience at its lack of real musical substance. In between, the HMV Empire played host to Philip Venables and David Hoyle’s scabrous, scary, and hilarious performance piece Illusions, first seen in Hull in 2017. And in Drapers’ Hall, the pianists Xenia Pestova Bennett, Sarah Nicolls, and Eliza McCarthy returned to Arlene Sierra’s Urban Birds from 2014. Sierra overlays samples of the songs of three familiar British birds – the blackcap, skylark and cuckoo – with the sounds of the three pianos, with added percussion and disklavier, so that the birds become part of the musical fabric in an utterly unpretentious and in the end rather touching way.  Recordings from the New Music Biennial will be included in BBC Radio 3’s New Music Show from 30 April, and the whole event is repeated at the Southbank Centre, London, from 1 to 3 July.
