1/15/2022,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Sixteen years after their legal battle began, about 18,000 homeowners in central Florida will be paid more than $42 million collectively by the state of Florida for destroying their citrus trees during an effort to eradicate a harmful citrus disease. The homeowners in Orange County will receive about $700 per healthy tree destroyed as part of an order issued in state court in Orlando last month. A judgment from a 2014 trial assessed the value of each healthy tree as $344, but fees and interests over the years doubled the per-tree payment. More than 60,000 healthy, uninfected trees were destroyed in Orange County between 2002 and 2006 as part of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services' efforts to eradicate citrus canker, according to the lawsuit. While unharmful to humans, citrus canker can cause the leaves and fruit of citrus trees to drop prematurely and create unappealing lesions on the fruit. The lesions leak bacterial cells that can spread to other trees by wind, rain or contaminated equipment, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services had argued that the homeowners' trees were a public nuisance and didn't have value worth compensating. Under the program, healthy trees that were within 1900 feet (580 meters) of an infected tree were destroyed in an effort to stop the disease's spread. As compensation, the state in the 2000s offered Florida homeowners $100 Walmart gift cards for their first destroyed tree and $55 for each additional tree. In cases where homeowners resisted, authorities threatened arrest or obtained warrants to go onto private property and destroy trees. The Florida Legislature approved payments for the Orange County homeowners last year. A third-party administrator will distribute the checks and track down homeowners whose addresses are no longer current. Tens of thousands of homeowners in Broward, Lee and Palm Beach counties won class action lawsuits against the state over their destroyed trees, and compensations varied by county. A case in Miami-Dade County is still pending. ___ Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at https://twitter.com/MikeSchneiderAP",U.S./Associated Press,Owners to get $42 million for citrus trees Florida destroyed,https://news.yahoo.com/owners-42-million-citrus-trees-175645395.html
1/15/2022,"Kevin McCarthy said Trump told him personally that he bore some responsibility for the Capitol riot. McCarthy made those remarks on a radio show and privately in a phone call with Republicans last year, per CNN. During a news conference on Thursday, McCarthy said he couldn't recall the phone call. In the days after January 6, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told Republicans in a private phone call that then-President Donald Trump admitted he shares some responsibility for the Capitol riot, according to CNN. But during a news conference on Thursday, McCarthy told reporters that he couldn't recall that phone conversation on January 11, 2021. ""I'm not sure what call you're talking about,"" McCarthy said. CNN reported on the phone call at the time, and on Thursday the news outlet obtained a detailed readout of what McCarthy told his Republican colleagues. ""Let me be clear to you and I have been very clear to the president. He bears responsibility for his words and actions. No if ands or buts,"" McCarthy told House Republicans on January 11, 2021, according to CNN. ""I asked him personally today if he holds responsibility for what happened. If he feels bad about what happened. He told me he does have some responsibility for what happened. But he needs to acknowledge that."" McCarthy also said in a local radio interview on January 12, 2021, that Trump ""told me personally that he does have some responsibility"" for the riot, CNN reported. The House Republican leader has since resisted pinning any blame on Trump for the Capitol riot. The former president has never publicly admit any responsibility for the day's violence. McCarthy's comments surrounding January 6 have come under scrutiny after the House select committee investigating the Capitol riot reached out to him on Wednesday to voluntarily cooperate with the probe. The California Republican rejected the congressional panel's request on Thursday, calling the committee ""illegitimate."" ""As a representative and the leader of the minority party, it is with neither regret nor satisfaction that I have concluded to not participate with this select committee's abuse of power that stains this institution today and will harm it going forward,"" he said. McCarthy reportedly originally backed the creation of a bipartisan 9/11-style commission to investigate the Capitol riot, yet later withdrew his support because it failed to include civil unrest during the summer of 2020 as part of its investigation, as many Republicans had called for. He has since repeatedly condemned the committee as a partisan tool. McCarthy's office did not immediately return Insider's request for comment.

1/15/2022,"Photos and videos from Chinese quarantine camps show that government officials are isolating residents in what looks like hundreds of metal boxes.

Twenty million Chinese residents from Xi’an, Yuzhou and Anyang are being confined to their homes as a result of China’s strict “zero-COVID” policy.

Additionally, China has set up quarantine camps with hundreds of metal boxes to house infected individuals to further halt the spread of the virus, according to the Daily Mail.

Twitter user @songpinganq re-shared videos showing the rows of temporary housing and the scarce conditions inside the boxes as well as of buses transporting hundreds of people with their luggage to their quarantine camps.
 
 Most times chinese government will take you to covid quarantine camp with bus in the middle of night.
I guess even they themselves think this behavior is a little shade,so they usually try not to get attention ( take people away in the night). pic.twitter.com/jdBaMOjIap

In the captions, the social media user alleges that pregnant women, children and the elderly are among those sent to the Xi'an camps. Workers provide the detainees with little food and unheated, tiny boxes. The infected are reportedly forced to live with little more than one wooden bed and a toilet nearby for as long as two weeks.

Those staying at the Mingde 8 Yingli housing compound say they were told just after midnight on Jan. 1 that they had to immediately go to the quarantine camp, according to BBC. Various witnesses reportedly also claimed about 30 buses transferred approximately 1,000 people to the site.

'There is nothing here, just basic necessities... Nobody has come to check up on us, what kind of quarantine is this?’ one social media user said. “They didn't make any proper arrangements and so they just carelessly placed us.”

The video is the latest zero-COVID controversy to have rattled Chinese users on social media. A video of a man being beaten by pandemic workers outside the camp after he left to buy steamed buns went viral over the weekend, according to BBC.
  But there was also this video of a resident being beaten by anti-epidemic workers after he allegedly left his community to get steamed buns because he was so hungry. The two community workers have reportedly been detained by Xi'an police. pic.twitter.com/lxHv6zl1gF  — Manya Koetse (@manyapan) January 1, 2022    Featured image via @songpinganq Enjoy this content?

1/15/2022,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki: “You are 17 times more likely to go to the hospital if you’re not vaccinated, 20 times more likely to die.” PolitiFact's ruling: True Here's why: On Jan. 10, when the U.S. reported 1.35 million new COVID-19 cases — the highest daily total for any country on record — White House press secretary Jen Psaki faced pushback regarding President Joe Biden’s assertion that the pandemic is, at this point, ""a pandemic of the unvaccinated."" During a press briefing that day, Fox News reporter Peter Doocy implied that Biden’s characterization was inaccurate. ""I understand that the science says that vaccines prevent death,"" he said. ""But I’m triple vaxxed, still got COVID. You’re triple vaxxed, still got COVID. Why is the president still referring to this as a ‘pandemic of the unvaccinated?’"" In her response, Psaki emphasized that vaccination status contributes to a ""significant difference"" in COVID-19 experiences. ""I had been triple vaxxed,"" she said. ""I had minor symptoms. There is a huge difference between that and being unvaccinated."" She continued: ""You are 17 times more likely to go to the hospital if you’re not vaccinated, 20 times more likely to die. And those are significant, serious statistics. So, yes, the impact for people who are unvaccinated is far more dire than those who are vaccinated."" A spokesperson for Psaki said she was referring to publicly available data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And the CDC data support her claim. In October, unvaccinated people had 10 times the risk of testing positive for COVID-19 and 20 times the risk of dying from COVID-19 compared with people who were fully vaccinated with additional or booster doses, according to the CDC’s COVID Data Tracker. On COVID-19 hospitalizations, CDC data from the end of November 2021 indicated that unvaccinated adults ages 18 years and older were hospitalized with COVID-19 at a rate of about 67.8 per 100,000. By comparison, the rate for fully vaccinated individuals was about 3.9 per 100,000, meaning unvaccinated people were about 17 times more likely to be hospitalized due to COVID-19. Data from Texas also supports Psaki’s claims. According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, data from September indicated that ""Texans not vaccinated against COVID-19 were about 20 times more likely to suffer a COVID-19-associated death and 13 times more likely to test positive than people who were fully vaccinated."" With the U.S. now averaging more than 700,000 new coronavirus cases every day, the data shows that people who are unvaccinated are at a higher risk of severe illness and death than those who are vaccinated. The CDC says scientists are currently researching how protected fully vaccinated people will be against infection, hospitalization and death where the omicron variant is concerned. The highly transmissible variant began to spread in the U.S. in early December and is fueling a surge that experts predict could last through January. But some of the most recent omicron surge data from cities New York and Seattle indicates that COVID-19 vaccines still ""radically reduce the chance of severe COVID illness,"" according to a data analysis by the New York Times. Data on COVID-19 deaths from those cities indicates a relatively low risk of death for people who are vaccinated. Deaths among the vaccinated are expected to rise due to an increase in vaccinated people who have contracted the virus. ""They are likely to be concentrated among people in vulnerable health, including the elderly and those with a serious underlying medical condition like a previous organ transplant — especially if they’re not boosted."" Data on deaths lags behind data on infections by about three weeks. But the Times reported that the early numbers suggest any increases in deaths among the vaccinated will be comparatively modest. ""Deaths among unvaccinated New Yorkers and Seattleites had already begun to surge in December,"" the Times wrote. ""Deaths among the vaccinated had not."" Psaki said ""You are 17 times more likely to go to the hospital if you’re not vaccinated, 20 times more likely to die,"" compared to people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The most complete data available from the CDC and research from Texas support this claim. While those studies are based on data collected prior to omicron variant spreading in the U.S., early data from New York and Seattle in December and January continue to suggest a significant gap between the experiences of the unvaccinated and the vaccinated who become infected.

1/15/2022,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russia on Friday strongly reaffirmed its demand that NATO doesn't expand eastward despite the rejection of that by the military alliance amid a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned that Moscow wouldn't wait indefinitely for the Western response, saying he expects the U.S. and NATO to provide a written answer next week. Lavrov described Moscow’s demands for binding guarantees that NATO will not embrace Ukraine or any other ex-Soviet nations, or station its forces and weapons there as essential for the progress of diplomatic efforts to defuse soaring tensions over Ukraine. He argued that NATO's deployments and drills near Russia’s borders pose a security challenge that must be addressed immediately. “We have run out of patience,” Lavrov said at a news conference. “The West has been driven by hubris and has exacerbated tensions in violation of its obligations and common sense.” Amid the tensions, Ukraine sustained a massive cyberattack Friday, which hit websites of multiple government agencies. This week's negotiations in Geneva and a related NATO-Russia meeting in Brussels were held amid a significant Russian troop buildup near Ukraine that the West fears might be a prelude to an invasion. Russia, which annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014, has denied having plans to attack its neighbor but warned the West that NATO's expansion to Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations is a “red line” that mustn't be crossed. Washington and its allies firmly rejected Moscow's demand for security guarantees precluding NATO's expansion, but Russia and the West agreed to leave the door open to possible further talks on arms control and confidence-building measures intended to reduce the potential for hostilities. Lavrov said that those issues are secondary in respect to Moscow's main demand for the non-expansion of NATO and the non-deployment of its weapons near the Russian territory, emphasizing that the Russian proposals represent a “package, not a menu.” ""They must understand that the key to everything is the guarantee that NATO will not expand eastward,"" Lavrov said. He countered the U.S. and NATO's argument that Russia doesn't have veto power to prevent other nations from joining the alliance by pointing to international agreements emphasizing that the security of some states mustn't be achieved at the expense of others. Russia's top diplomat warned that “if our proposals are rejected ... we will make a decision on how to ensure our security in a reliable way,” citing President Vladimir Putin's warning that Moscow will take unspecified ""military-technical measures"" if the West stonewalls its demands. Lavrov's deputy, Sergei Ryabkov, who led the Russian delegation at the talks in Geneva, said Thursday that he would “neither confirm nor exclude” the possibility of Russia sending military assets to Cuba and Venezuela if the U.S. and its allies don’t curtail their military activities on Russia’s doorstep. U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan dismissed the statements about a possible Russian deployment to Cuba and Venezuela as “bluster in the public commentary.” The negotiations took place as an estimated 100,000 Russian troops with tanks and other heavy weapons are massed near Ukraine’s eastern border. The U.S. and its allies urged Russia to deescalate by pulling troops back to their permanent bases, but Moscow has rebuffed the demand, saying it's free to deploy forces on its territory wherever it deems necessary. Lavrov called the Western demand “absurd,” noting that “while they are demanding that we pull troops on our own territory back to their barracks, the U.S. and British troops are deployed to the Baltics.” The Russian Defense Ministry said Friday that troops stationed in eastern Siberia and the far east region have been scrambled for movement across the country as part of snap drills to check their “readiness to perform their tasks after redeployment to a large distance.” The ministry noted that “a special attention will be given to the assessment of the country's transport infrastructure to ensure the movement of troops,” adding that the troops will conduct drills involving firing live ammunition after the redeployment. Russia seized the Crimean Peninsula after the ouster of Ukraine’s Moscow-friendly leader and in 2014 also threw its weight behind a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine. More than 14,000 people have been killed in nearly eight years of fighting between the Russia-backed rebels and Ukrainian forces in the country's industrial heartland called Donbas. Ukraine's military intelligence said Friday that separatist forces have launched drills involving firing live ammunition that are overseen by Russian military officers. Ukraine and the West have accused Russia of deploying its troops to Donbas to back separatists — accusations that Moscow has denied. ___ Yuras Karmanau in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed to this report.",World/Associated Press,"Russia demands US, NATO response next week on Ukraine",https://news.yahoo.com/russia-demands-us-nato-response-092601726.html
1/15/2022,"LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — Colorado's governor is warning he will “protect and aggressively assert” his state's water rights after Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts announced a plan to spend $500 million on a canal and reservoir project that includes claiming access to land in Colorado under a 99-year-old compact between the states. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said he will work with Nebraska but wants more details about what the state has planned. His comments came as Ricketts released a proposed state budget Thursday detailing how he intends to fund the project. “We will continue to protect and aggressively assert Colorado’s rights under all existing water compacts,"" Polis said in a statement Wednesday evening. “Colorado has been in full compliance with the South Platte Compact for the 99 years the agreement has been in place, and water has not and is not being withheld from Nebraska.” Ricketts and Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson announced the water plan after Colorado released a report that identified 282 new water projects within the South Platte River Basin. Ricketts and Peterson warned that those projects could reduce its water flows from the river by as much as 90% and threaten Nebraska's water supplies. “We must act to preserve, protect, manage, and steward our water supply for our future Nebraskans,"" Ricketts said Thursday in his annual State of the State address to lawmakers. The South Platte River Compact, approved in 1923, is a water-sharing agreement that entitles Nebraska to 120 cubic feet per second from the river during the irrigation season between April 1 and Oct. 15, and 500 cubic feet per second during the non-irrigation season. Under the compact, Nebraska can build, maintain and operate canals within Colorado’s borders that divert water from the South Platte River for use by Nebraska. It also gives Nebraska the power to buy land from Colorado landowners or gain access by invoking eminent domain. Nebraska’s move is likely to trigger lawsuits. Polis said Ricketts' comments “seem to reflect a misunderstanding of Colorado's locally driven water planning process,"" and that the projects identified “should not be taken as formally approved projects."" “We hope to more fully understand Nebraska's concerns and goals, as so far as those concerns and goals are quite simply hard to make sense of,” Polis said. “Our longstanding compliance of and respect for the water agreement between our states on the South Platte River remains intact and we hope that our partners in Nebraska will show that they share that respect."" Ricketts released a budget plan Thursday that would pay for the canal project by taking $400 million out of the state's $1.5 billion cash reserve fund and using $100 million in federal pandemic relief money. The project would include a canal in rural Perkins County in southwest Nebraska and storage facilities. Some of the infrastructure would sit on the Colorado side of the border, and might require the state to invoke eminent domain against private landowners. It's not clear exactly where the project would go, how deep into Colorado it would travel, or which landowners could be affected. Lawmakers on the budget-writing Appropriations Committee are likely to question the project once the funding bill is introduced. Ricketts said this week that Nebraska started work on a river canal near Julesburg, Colorado, before World War I, but abandoned the project. Any water fight between the states could last for years. Nebraska spent decades in a water fight with Kansas over access to the Republican River, which runs through Colorado, Nebraska and Kansas. The lawsuits revolved around a similar compact with the three states that was approved in 1943. ___ Follow Grant Schulte on Twitter: https://twitter.com/GrantSchulte",U.S./Associated Press,Colorado to 'aggressively assert' water rights with Nebraska,https://news.yahoo.com/colorado-aggressively-assert-water-rights-202907499.html
