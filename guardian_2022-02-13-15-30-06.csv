2/13/2022,"Howard and I make a second visit to the plots since remedial work began and the padlocks changed. We can’t get in so we wander through the woods at the back and stand peering over the fence, like foundlings. The days are just a little longer. Daffodil shoots are starting to show in the woods. Bluebells can’t be too far away. There is a chill, but early signs of spring in the air.  It is almost an ache, the separation. Locked out of love. The plot isn’t only about growing fruit and veg and flowers for me – though I carefully source our seed and take extreme care in how we work. Our gardening is a collaboration with soil. Listening to the land. A plant partnership. Husbandry. We are still at a standstill. I can’t bring myself to sort through the shelves and bags and bags and bowls of seed. They will wait until we’re granted parole. Or until Henri has finally lost her patience. We are starting discussions with an organic farmer friend of Jane Scotter about sourcing some of his cow manure. Edging close to ready for when the starter gun goes off. It’ll be like a land rush in the American West. All that’s missing are covered wagons. For now, allotment love has shifted back to the pots of bulbs on the roof terrace. I whisper quiet encouragement. Check on them every day. Like rabbits’ ears starting to stick through, the early narcissi are first to show: a true garden sign of spring. The plot may be delayed. But the year will shift soon enough. We will again gather together. We will dare to share our planting plans, think about working parties, perhaps a summer barbecue. Howard and I will hunt for pea and bean poles. For now, we take comfort in new growth, new life. We will commune over the garden wall and wait. Allan Jenkins’s Plot 29 (4th Estate, £9.99) is out now.

2/13/2022,"Despite increasingly frantic warnings from Washington about an “imminent” attack, all-out war in Ukraine is not inevitable. Far from it. Russian president Vladimir Putin’s military pressure tactics are working. The west has been forced to listen to his grievances. Fighting could start soon. But US intelligence is not exact, and Moscow is adept at spreading disinformation and fear. Just as likely, this standoff could last months. Meanwhile, diplomacy still has a chance. The best hope remains the path to peace outlined last week by French president Emmanuel Macron during talks with Putin in Moscow. How shaming, and dangerous, that Boris Johnson’s government is so unsupportive. Brexit Britain, detached by choice from the EU and in thrall to US policy, is undermining European diplomatic efforts to defuse the crisis.  The UK used to act as a transatlantic bridge and interlocutor. Now it’s become a barrier to understanding, doomed to irrelevance. Last week’s spectacle of Britain’s prime minister and foreign and defence secretaries, representing a once influential, respected nation, traipsing around Europe issuing vacuous threats was embarrassing. In Moscow, foreign minister Sergei Lavrov mocked the “slogans” spouted by Liz Truss, his UK counterpart. In Brussels, Johnson was grimly portentous – and clueless about what to do. Johnson’s choice of awayday destinations is instructive. So far he has served Christmas turkey to British troops in Tallinn, nabbed a substance-free photo op in Kyiv, and visited fellow EU-hating populists in Warsaw. Not exactly mainstream diplomacy. Gaffe-prone Truss, heir to Castlereagh, Balfour and Bevin, did not drive her Margaret Thatcher tank to the Kremlin, but she might as well have done for all the good her visit did. British policy on Ukraine remains clumsily focused on “deterrence”, not solutions. This basically means shouting at Russian president Vladimir Putin to back off – or else. Yet Britain has no “or else”. Through no fault of their own, its depleted, underfunded, poorly equipped armed forces make little difference to Kremlin calculations. The most potent unilateral UK weapon – effective measures to curb the laundering of stolen Russian money – has yet to be fully deployed, the result, perhaps, of the Conservative party’s avidity for red gold. When this government talks deterrence, it’s relying on others, principally the US, to do what it cannot or will not do itself. For all its posturing and fist-waving, Britain is barely in the diplomatic hunt. Few people other than worried leaders of the all but indefensible Baltic republics – who will take any help they can get – listen to London any more. Johnson and his cronies are reduced to snarky sniping from the sidelines as headline-grabbing French diplomacy leaves them trailing in the snow. Emmanuel Macron, Johnson’s bete noir and chief Brexit adversary, made important advances last week in face-to-face talks with Putin, sketching the outlines of a possible deal. Judging by Downing Street’s reaction, Johnson would prefer war to success for the French president. Anonymous officials and government sources variously accused Macron of betraying Nato, rewarding aggression, electioneering, and “waving a white flag” – Savile-style slurs happily amplified by Tory-backing, Francophobe commentators prating about appeasement and “Macron’s Munich moment”. When such a low is reached, it’s clear that post-Brexit failings, personal grudges and snide blame-games, coupled with isolated Britain’s chronic lack of ideas, clout, and responsible leadership, wax dangerous in the extreme. British attacks are not solely aimed at Paris. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, loth to blow up gas supply lines from Russia, is criticised, as is the EU. Yet sour grapes aside, much of this cross-Channel barracking is calculated. It’s deliberately intended for American consumption. By confusing spite with independent thinking, such bilge supposedly demonstrates to a panicking US president, Joe Biden, that whatever those cowardly, sneaky Europeans may be up to, Britain remains Washington’s stalwart friend – even when Washington, blowing noisy trumpets, is drowning in its own hype. This, in short, is Johnson’s made-in-Brexitland foreign policy: hug America, screw Europe. It’s a distasteful appeal to a shared though vanishing Anglo-Saxon heritage. It’s cynical, self-harming, dishonest, divisive and, most dangerous of all, it’s a gift to Putin. It’s not Macron who threatens western unity. It’s Big Dog. What’s so terrible, for example, about neutrality for Ukraine? It’s obvious, despite rhetoric about open doors and sovereign rights, that US-led Nato does not want Kyiv to join the club. So say so candidly. It’s true the Minsk ceasefire deal after the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea, championed by Macron, is a fudge that means different things to different people. But it’s also a crucial product of the only peace process in town. So fudge some more. Buy some time. De-escalate. Are the Russians justified in complaining that Nato broke pledges to steer clear of Moscow’s post-Soviet borders? Yes, suggests Macron, inching towards Putin’s demand for “indivisible security” – meaning one state’s security does not undermine another’s. There is plainly scope for compromises here, especially if Putin keeps his reported promise to freeze the military buildup and pull troops out of Belarus. Trouble is, the US, egged on by Johnson’s tatty Churchill tribute act, rejects outright changes to Europe’s “security architecture”. It also favours Kyiv’s interpretation of what the Minsk agreements say should happen in the disputed Donbas region. And although the US promises to discuss limiting its deployment in Europe of new nuclear-capable, medium-range missiles – an alarming, largely undiscussed reprise of Washington’s 1980s cruise and Pershing missile cold war escalation – it insists that Putin back down first. That’s unrealistic. To sum up. Pariah Putin, an international hooligan, triggered the Ukraine crisis and is now exploiting it. Macron, representing France and the EU, is trying hard to resolve it. And ill-judged, hardline and hostile American and British attitudes may yet cause him to fail. Is this because Washington and London know what’s best for Europe? No. It’s because the US, projecting its national interests through Nato, and the feckless, lying windbag in Downing Street, cannot bear the thought of an empowered, strategically autonomous Europe successfully managing its own security. This is England. This is Brexit. This is dismal.",Opinion/Opinion,"As Europe pushes for peace, clueless Johnson snipes from the sidelines",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/13/ukraine-macron-putin-johnson-feckless-windbag-no-10
2/13/2022,"The question My partner has suffered from depression for decades, but only saw the doctor once, stopped taking the medication after a few months, and refuses to go on it again. They won’t talk to anyone or seek help professionally or from family – not even me. In the last two years, Covid has had a major impact on their mental health, and their behaviour on top of this is now affecting me massively. In the past, I’ve been told I’m very positive and happy. I’m certainly not that now. But I don’t want to go on medication myself.  I try hard to get things right, and I’m not perfect – but nothing I do is good enough for them. They talk at me as though I’m stupid. It is not in my nature to be aggressive, but sometimes I have to defend myself. I’m being constantly made to feel guilty that everything is my fault. There’s no logic to their thoughts. They don’t have any close friends or any hobbies, and they seem to resent me when I do things, but they won’t do them with me. I would like to see change – how though? After so many years it seems unlikely. Philippa’s answer It is as though you are both stuck in a game of who is right and who is wrong, each of you jostling for the superior position. Resentments mount up and yet you are both locked in. Neither of you is changing, neither is leaving. Many counsellors use something called the Karpman Drama Triangle to make sense of what is happening in a relationship. The point of it is to put to one side what you are arguing about and examine instead your patterns of relating to each other. Imagine a triangle: the pointy bit at the bottom is labelled Victim, and the other two corners are labelled Persecutor and Rescuer respectively. At the moment, you are dancing around the triangle from Rescuer to Persecutor to Victim and back again. What seems to me to be happening is that you get into the Rescuer role by trying to persuade your partner to get help for their depression. It sounds like they experience this as persecution and they get defensive and persecute back and then you feel like a victim. So, how to escape from these three unhelpful roles? First, how not to persecute: you can ban yourself from using certain phrases, such as “You always…” “You are…” “You should…” In other words, don’t tell them what they are like, don’t define them and don’t give unasked-for advice because these types of remarks are likely to be experienced by them as persecutory, however well-intended the sentiment behind them is. Secondly, when you are trying too hard to get things right for them, that’s when you are in the Rescuer role. This could be perceived by them as patronising. We get into rescue mode when we do things for people that they are capable of doing for themselves and it can be experienced by them as infantilising. Don’t even try to be perfect, being you is enough. Thirdly, when you play the victim, you are giving away your power. Recognise when you are playing the martyr and stop. You have friends and hobbies, you can get your sense of who you are from others and from things you enjoy. If you allow yourself to be dragged down by your partner, you will resent them for it. If you don’t allow it, you won’t. And you know what they say about resentment? “Resentment is like drinking poison and expecting your enemy to die.” Real victims are helpless and cannot take responsibility for their predicament. Playing the victim is different – you are choosing not to take responsibility. Even when your partner belittles you, you don’t have to play the victim to their persecution. When I’m insulted, I can use the following way of diffusing the situation instead of getting aggressive. For example, in response to the insult, “You’re stupid”, I could say, “Oh, you think I’m stupid, thanks for letting me know.” In other words, I don’t agree or disagree with what has been said, but show them I’ve heard. When we feel heard we don’t have to shout louder. Echoing back what you’ve heard so you don’t ignore them will calm things down. If they say something like, “Doctors can’t help me” you don’t have to argue, you can just respond with, “Ah, you feel doctors can’t help you.” After you’ve both agreed that they believe doctors can’t help, you might say, “I would be so much less anxious if you gave the doctors another try.” This will be experienced by them differently than the more combative, “You should…” because you’d be defining yourself and not them. There is much less logic to any of our thoughts than we’d like to believe. Logic rarely solves disputes but when there is a mutual understanding of feelings, it is far easier to reach a solution. This means instead of trying to win using logic, try instead to understand by listening to feelings, yours and theirs, as this is the path to compromise and getting unstuck. Short answer, you can change how you react to them and see what happens or you can leave. But if you do leave, beware the Karpman Drama Triangle doesn’t get the upper hand in subsequent relationships.

2/13/2022,"The spiralling cost of living will have a “crippling” impact on young people, experts have warned, as a new report found that under-30s are disproportionately being forced to bear the brunt of the costs of social care reform and Covid. Research by the Intergenerational Foundation thinktank, to be published on Monday, claims that younger workers are being unfairly targeted by the government in a “tax by stealth” caused by freezes on income tax brackets and the student loan repayment threshold, as well as April’s national insurance rise.  Low-earning young people will be hit hardest by the changes, claims the report, having a significant impact on their take home pay, disposable income and potential to save for housing and pensions. Researchers calculate a graduate earning £27,000 a year will see their deductions rise by about 20% over the next four years – from 18% of their pay to 22%. They predict their disposable income will drop by almost 30%. They calculate that younger workers will pay more than 10 times more in national insurance contributions each year than workers aged 65-plus. Labelling under-30s the “packhorse generation”, the thinktank claims they are being targeted by the government, which it says is using high inflation to pull more low-income, and especially younger, workers into taxation sooner. Angus Hanton, co-founder of the Intergenerational Foundation, said the policies will have a “crippling” impact on young peoples’ lives. “Our figures suggest many young graduates will see about a 30% drop in their disposable income within the next four years. So it’s really going to bite. And that’s before you take into account probably a 50% energy bill hike in April,” he said. “It will hit young people harder than older generations – partly because they’ve got less margins of safety. But also, largely because the government are taxing earned income so heavily and unearned income so lightly.” Hanton accused the government of being “intergenerationally unfair” in its policies. It will, he believes, lead to many young people feeling resentful. “After all they have sacrificed to protect older generations during the pandemic, lower-earning younger generations will be forced to shoulder the cost of government promises to increase social care spending and reduce Covid-19 debt, when both spending decisions were made to protect older generations,” he said. Instead, he added, they should charge national insurance on landlord and dividend income, which he says would be fairer and calculates would raise £24bn a year. Alana McSkimming, 23, would like to move into her own place, but is living with her parents because she cannot afford to rent or buy in the face of rising living costs. The marketing executive from Woking feels “stuck”. “I’d like to move out, I’d like to go out on my own, but the cost of living means I would be spending every single thing I earn,” she said. “There would be no disposable income, no savings and realistically I wouldn’t be able to move out on my own.” After graduating in 2019, it took her a year to get an apprenticeship and in August she got her current job, working remotely from home. She believes there is “huge generational inequality” – with many young people unable to get on the housing ladder as their parents might have done – and fears the generation after her will be even worse off. She doesn’t believe government policies are targeted to benefit young people. “You feel like you’re never really taking that next step in life, you’re never growing up because you’re never able to have a place to call your own,” she said. “You don’t feel you’re reaching milestones your parents would have reached.” The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) published a report on Thursday that said students in England were being hit by stealth cuts and tax rises and accused the government of using high inflation to “quietly tighten the financial screws”. A Treasury spokesperson said: “We recognise the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, and are providing support worth around £20bn this financial year and next to help.”",News/Business,Tory government’s ‘tax by stealth’ will hit under-30s on low wages hardest,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/13/tory-tax-by-stealth-hit-young-people-on-low-wages-report
2/13/2022,"The most comprehensive analysis of the UK’s anti-vax community reveals that just 0.32% of the population is active in the movement, contradicting its claim to represent “the 99%”. The first analysis of its kind shows that the anti-vax movement is far smaller than expected, with about 220,000 unique active users identified within a network of 427 groups on the messaging app Telegram, its preferred platform.  Analysts, however, expressed concern about the “high crossover” between anti-vax ideologies and QAnon, the online conspiracy theory whose supporters stormed the US Capitol and whose violent tendencies prompted the FBI to label it a domestic terrorism threat in 2019. The analysis, by Logically, a tech company that tackles misinformation by using factcheckers and open-source intelligence, also found that the conspiracy groups’ network structure reveals “sophisticated and repeated organisational tactics” throughout the UK. Jordan Wildon, analyst at Logically, said: “Group membership was lower than originally expected. There are still a lot of people involved, but given how loud they are and how much attention they receive, they give the impression that they form a much larger group.” He added: “Alongside that, the notion that they are “the 99%” helps draw others into the movement as they consider themselves to be part of the majority which, as our findings show, couldn’t be further from the truth.” Dominating the UK anti-vax community are 13 national networks including the Great Reopening, supported by prominent coronavirus conspiracy theorists such as David Icke – who has claimed that the world is run by a race of lizard people – and Jeremy Corbyn’s brother, Piers. Another is Alpha Men Assemble, whose supporters have run military-style training sessions in preparation for a “war” against the state, and who were among those who accosted the Labour leader Keir Starmer last week. To identify which part of the UK had the most proactive anti-vax community, analysts investigated a sample of 152 Covid-conspiracy Telegram groups and found that 81% – or 44,914 members – were “unique”, that is individuals who had posted rather than bots (software designed to simulate a human activity). The highest number of active unique users was identified in the south-west of England, London and the south-east, followed by the north-west and east Midlands. Each network, according to the research, had as many as 80 regional affiliated Telegram groups and was able rapidly to disseminate livestreams from UK protests, or inflammatory and misleading articles on Covid. The YouTube channel Resistance GB broadcast the attack on Starmer by anti-vax protesters live last week. Piers Corbyn, one of the movement’s most high-profile figures, shared a video of his supporters mobbing Starmer to his Telegram channel. Examining the structure of the online anti-vax community, researchers found that smaller, regional groups were crucial in orchestrating “direction action, strategies on a smaller scale and recruitment”. Wildon said that the structure of Telegram, increasingly under fire for hosting violent extremists, had had a “huge impact on the shape of the UK Covid disinformation space” with its creation of an ecosystem where conspiracy theories could be easily exchanged. He added: “After platforms cracked down on QAnon and Covid disinformation, the rise of Telegram has created a microcosm with much fewer boundaries between groups and ideologies and a far more rapid form of dissemination between them, both at an international level and a national one.” Experts have coined the term “cultic milieu” to explain why UK conspiracy theories – such as those involving 5G masts and Covid – QAnon-fuelled anti-lockdown protests in the US, and David Icke’s return to prominence as a figurehead of disinformation have tended to weave together since the first lockdowns were introduced in 2020. Wilson said that the exporting of the QAnon conspiracy to the UK via the #saveourchildren hashtag had allowed for a particular mix of “paedophile, satanic deep state meta-conspiracy to serve as an epistemological frame for Covid”. That, he said, partly explained why “paedo protector” is a common insult thrown at police at anti-vax and anti-lockdown protests, with the term shouted at Starmer during the protests last week.",News/Society,The UK’s homegrown conspiracy groups with links to QAnon,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/13/uk-homegrown-conspiracy-groups-links-to-qanon
2/13/2022,"Europe stands on the brink of war. The biggest conflagration since 1945 is now an all-too-real prospect. For many people, this seems incredible. How did we come to this? Are the terrible lessons of the Nazi era, of the Cold War invasions of Hungary and Czechoslovakia, of Bosnia, Kosovo and of previous suppressions of free peoples by tyrannical leaders all now forgotten? Hopefully not. And yet history, confounding reason, appears set to repeat itself. As this dread maelstrom spins, the US, Britain and the Nato allies are united in three key respects. First, their intelligence services agree Russia has sufficient military capability around Ukraine’s borders to mount a full-scale invasion, seize the capital, Kyiv, and force a change of government that better suits Moscow’s interests. US president Joe Biden suggests an attack could come as early as Wednesday. Second, the western powers are unanimous in blaming this desperate situation on Russia’s president. Vladimir Putin, and only Vladimir Putin, they believe, will decide if, when, where and how an invasion takes place. At this point (and contrary to what Biden told the allies), it’s unclear whether Putin has made a final decision. This is crucial. It means he may yet be dissuaded. It also means he, pre-eminently, will be to blame if the worst happens.  Third, the 30 Nato countries all agree they will not directly intervene militarily to assist Ukraine. This controversial stance is certain to be re-examined endlessly, whatever happens in the coming days. Ukraine is not a Nato member. There is no legal obligation to help. No one (or almost no one) wants a third world war, as a slightly panicked Biden put it last week. Yet the possibility of being obliged to look on impotently as a young, newly independent, sovereign democracy with an inalienable right to choose its friends and alliances is trampled underfoot sickens the stomach. If this is indeed the outcome, the consequences will be far-reaching. What is the western alliance for, many will ask, if not to defend freedom against unprovoked aggression? Such inquests are unavoidable and necessary – but will have to await events. Right now, a number of pressing priorities arise. Given the pessimistic intelligence evaluations concerning Putin’s intentions, it is imperative the government move with the utmost urgency to ensure the safe evacuation of British citizens (and non-combatant military personnel and diplomats). In this respect, the Foreign Office has particular responsibility. There must be no repeat of the chaos that surrounded last year’s withdrawal from Afghanistan, when hundreds of Afghans and dual nationals who had every right to expect assistance from Britain were abandoned to the Taliban. As revealed by the Observer, thousands of emails pleading for help went unanswered as the Foreign Office was overwhelmed. This must not happen again. It’s not enough simply to advise Britons to leave. Emergency evacuation flights should be laid on as necessary. Coordinated western diplomatic efforts must also be stepped up to persuade Russia to back off. Biden’s phone call with Putin on Saturday should be swiftly followed up. Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, is best placed to do so. When he met Putin in Moscow last week they discussed how to settle some of the main areas of dispute, such as the future status of the eastern Donbas region. Macron should be encouraged to spearhead a diplomatic drive to avert disaster. If diplomacy is to succeed, it must have the full backing not only of the UN but of all of Nato’s leaders. That includes Boris Johnson, who has been outspoken in threatening Russia but has had little to say by way of constructive solutions. Much the same may be said of Britain’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, whose disastrous diplomatic debut in Moscow last week may have made matters worse. In casting himself as a Churchillian wartime leader at a pivotal moment in world affairs, the prime minister evidently hopes to distract public attention from the police investigation into lockdown partying in Downing Street. This is a vain hope. Johnson has been a marginal figure on the international stage as the Ukraine crisis has unfolded, accurately reflecting post-Brexit Britain’s diminished influence. If he thinks the embattled streets of Kyiv offer him an escape route, he is mistaken. It is of paramount importance, too, that Putin is forcefully reminded of the severe economic consequences Russia will face if he ignores international law, common sense and basic decency by attacking the people of Ukraine. Punitive sanctions on his regime, and him personally, must swiftly ensue – and Germany, Hungary, Austria and other waverers must fall into line. Britain, too, must finally act to curb Russian money-laundering in London. It is to be profoundly hoped that Russia can yet be prevented from making a catastrophic mistake. For whatever doubts exist about Nato, about US motives, and about the wisdom of war-fighting in general – and there are many – the west did not seek nor does it want this fight. Ultimate responsibility plainly lies with Putin and with Putin’s lies. This is Putin’s conflict.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on Europe being on the brink of war  | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/13/the-observer-view-on-europe-being-on-the-brink-of-war-ukraine

Rightly suspended for 18 months for a positive drugs test and missing out on the 2018 Olympics, this amazing athlete has served her time and she won the event in magnificent style. How did her victory taint the start of the Games? Is there a presupposition of recidivism in respect of an athlete who has broken the rules or do we, as an enlightened society, wipe the sheet clean after a fresh start?

I have heard nothing in my conversations with friends and neighbours other than total revulsion at Boris Johnson’s behaviour. Yet Dorries is the banner waver for this dreadful man. Her interview with Charlie Stayt was horrifying. MPs in this parliament seem interested only in their own skins and futures. Dorries is a prime example.

This could be addressed by giving prisoners the vote, as most of the rest of western Europe does.David MurrayWallington, Surrey I read with interest both the article on Kenneth Branagh’s film Belfast and subsequent letter (“There is no ‘they’ in Northern Ireland”). I don’t entirely agree with the letter writer’s comments on the issue of “they”. To me as an 11-year-old child living in a “mixed” estate in a small town in Northern Ireland, there were three components to “they”:  The “Tartan gang”, thugs who ran up our road shouting obscenities to the Catholic families, breaking our windows and threatening to burn us out;  Our Protestant neighbours, once dear friends who retreated indoors and, when meeting us many months later, snubbed us. The most hurtful part was when my very best friend whom I had known since little, blanked me when I tried to speak to her a couple of months later. The Catholic families were dislocated in so many ways;  Agents of the state, the army and police who stood at the bottom of our road, motionless, passive while we were terrified, even though our mother assured us we would be safe as “the RUC and army would protect us”. They did no such thing and we had to empty our houses and flee, allowing the marauding gangs to “pick a Fenian’s house” for their friends and families. No counselling for us. Also the letter writer uses the innocuous-sounding phrase “put out” in relation to people being intimidated and forced to flee their homes. “Putting somebody out” today means inconveniencing them but, believe you me, for my family and our Catholic neighbours it was a lot more than than that; it was ethnic cleansing on religious grounds. Superb I am sure it is, but I for one won’t be watching Mr Branagh’s film, as there will be far too many bad memories for me.Name and address supplied Zoe Wood’s article exactly encapsulates the government obsession with property ownership (“Thousands of renters in England could miss out on council tax cut”, News). At the core of its housing policy lies the dogma of possession: an “affordable” house is one that we can buy, albeit with help from the taxpayer; the idea that we need accommodation that is affordable to tenants is alien to the central dogma. It is entirely in line with this idea that many of the rebates will go to owners rather than tenants. That the underlying policy results in a catastrophic rise in the cost of buying a house and an even more catastrophic shortage of rentable property appears irrelevant. The owner, landlord, whatever, is all-important and damn the rest.Roger IredaleWest Coker, Somerset Stephanie Merritt draws on her own experience to demonstrate her reasons for being “on the side of workplace romances” (“Sure, let’s be wary of abuse of power, but do we really want to outlaw office romance?”, Comment). As a Gen Xer who “owes her existence” to a workplace romance, she writes in sympathy of those who lament the time before #MeToo, when “office flirtations” were less tightly regulated. Merritt’s article centres around Jeff Zucker, who resigned from his job as president of CNN after his sexual relationship with a colleague was exposed. Merritt says the relationship was consensual, so there should be no problem. As he was president of a multinational news channel, reducing this to an “office romance” between “consenting adults” overlooks the gendered power relations this “scandal” reveals. Every outpouring of grief and support for Zucker is evidence of a sycophantic hero-worshipping that serves to keep everyone under the spell of a white male leader. The drama surrounding Zucker’s resignation from CNN is not about “romance”. It is a perverse symptom of free market capitalism, celebrity culture and addiction to power that has gone off the deep end.Lorna DonoghueLondon, SW2 Somewhere in the corner of heaven reserved for sitcom scriptwriters, John Sullivan is reading about the “Platinum Jubbly” commemorative china and wishing he could have lived just long enough to write a Platinum Jubilee special of Only Fools and Horses (“I can’t wait to celebrate the Queen’s lovely Jubbly”, Comment).

2/13/2022," We regret that our headline (‘I didn’t take virus seriously’, admits statistician, 6 February, p12) did not accurately reflect the remark made by Sir David Spiegelhalter. As the article itself made clear, the Cambridge University scientist had told BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs that he was over-optimistic at the start of the coronavirus pandemic and did not take it “seriously enough”.  The US TV presenter Bill Maher is not a “Fox News host”; his show Real Time is broadcast by HBO (Sure, let’s be wary of abuse of power, but do we really want to outlaw office romance?, 6 February, p47).   Xu Weiping, head of the development company ABP, was incorrectly referred to on second and subsequent mentions in an article as Weiping. In Chinese, family names come first so we should have called him Xu (Boris Johnson’s flagship London dock scheme on brink of collapse, 6 February, p21).  An article (Battle lines drawn over fight for the future of UK’s biggest pension funds, 6 February, p50) referred to “the fewer than 1 million people in the UK who are still able to pay into defined benefit schemes”. It meant to say “private” defined benefit schemes.  A recipe for potatoes with olive oil, garlic and rosemary (Nigel Slater, 6 February, Magazine, p27) advised readers to “finely chop half the rosemary... and add to the onions”. That should have said, “add to the potatoes”. The onion instructions came later.

2/13/2022,"Nyetimber Rosé, Sussex, England NV (£31.49, Waitrose) Drinking pink champagne on Valentine’s Day is, I realise, hardly the most spontaneous or original act of love. It is the drink the Valentine’s industry tells us we can’t do without – a vehicle for the wine business to prey on our insecurities and carve out a piece of that lucrative territory held by florists and greetings card companies. Well, cynicism be damned: of all the daft fabricated traditions on this daftest and most commercialised of festive occasions, pink champagne is the one I’m happiest to indulge. This is a style that has improved beyond measure in the past 20 years. Winemakers have been treating it much more seriously than they used to, and making a lot more of it, too (today rosé accounts for 10% of all champagne production; it was a mere 2% in 2000). Something similar has happened on this side of the channel, too: English fizz makers are mastering wines with the sensual pink tint and, in Nyetimber’s impeccable case, gorgeous tumbling red fruit flavours. Domaine Julien Sunier Wild Soul Beaujolais Villages 2020 (bbr.com; robersonwine.com) Other seductive pink sparkling wines to charm your beloved tomorrow include the pillow-soft, aromatic, mellifluous (and mellifluously named) Fuchs & Hase Pet Nat Rosé from Austria (£20.40, peckhamcellars.co.uk); the punchy herby cherry-berry Co-op Cava Rosado Brut NV (£6.95, The Co-op) and the plump, satin-textured and tropically fruit-fragrant Ruinart Rosé Champagne NV (£69, jeroboams.co.uk). Do red sparkling wines count? Few would fail to be won over by the easy natural charm of Casa Belfi Rosso Bio Frizzante, which comes from Prosecco country, is made in the traditional way where the wine re-ferments in the bottle, and which has a gentle supple food-friendly cherry crunch and bite. For those looking for a Valentine’s without bubbles, in France the Valentine’s industry would push you towards a bottle from a particular village in Beaujolais: St-Amour. Domaine Billards 2019 (£15.99) is a bright, berry-filled delight. But, while it may not have the loving name on the label, Domaine Julien Sunier’s Beaujolais-Villages bottling has a real silky, slinky allure.  Taste the Difference Gewürztraminer, Alsace, France (£9, Sainsbury’s) Can a wine be sexy? The term does get used rather a lot in the wine-selling and wine-writing world, although generally it’s as a bloodless, blokeish term of appreciation, rather than something more interestingly kinky. But some wines really do have a certain x-rated je ne sais quoi. There is, for example, something very sexy about really great pinot noir reds from Burgundy. That has a lot to do with their sheer silk-sheeted texture. But it’s also in the way these wines, especially older wines, have something elusively animal in their fragrance, which gives them the same kind of mysterious, elemental pull that you find in really good, handmade French perfume. Something similar happens with Alsace’s gewürztraminer. When it’s young, it’s all about heady, dizzying rose-petal perfume, as you find in Sainsbury’s very attractive bottling. Try a mature bottle from a great producer such as Zind-Humbrecht or Marcel Deiss, however, and you’ll find yourself having a whole other, more adult multi-sensory experience.

2/13/2022,"Sugarcane London, 517 Wandsworth Road, London SW8 4PA (020 7498 8758). Starters £4-£6, mains £8.50-£10, platters for two £30, desserts £5.50, wines from £20 Sugarcane London is a small, tidy Caribbean café on the Wandsworth Road serving, among other things, very good jerk chicken. The skin is crisped and blackened and has a sweet, aromatic warmth from an enthusiastic assault by a seasoning mix heavy with the wonder that is allspice. This is a restaurant review, so obviously we care about these things; the food matters and it will get its moment.  But for now, there is another story that needs to be told: that of the man responsible for the jerk chicken and all the other deep, enfolding dishes coming out of the tiny open kitchen. I first heard about Tarell Mcintosh, self-styled as Chef Tee, courtesy of his neighbours. A few weeks ago, the restaurant was broken into. The shutters were wrecked, equipment and stock filched, the till emptied. Sugarcane London, one neighbour told me, had been a labour of love for Chef Tee, who had precious few resources when he started out and now had nothing. The local community, his neighbours and customers, crowdfunded the money he needed to get the place back on its feet. We talk earnestly about the importance of neighbourhood restaurants. We talk about their significance to communities. But this suggested a next level kind of love: a next level kind of importance. With good reason. As Chef Tee explained in the press release he put out in 2020 when the restaurant first opened (and which, to my shame, I completely missed), he grew up in care and wanted to do something for other care leavers. He is now 27, but has packed a lot into that short life: a bunch of degrees and time as a teacher, alongside jobs at restaurants such as Negril and Blues Kitchen in Brixton. He loved working and reworking Jamaican recipes at home, but by the point the pandemic arrived had decided to retrain in midwifery. Then one morning, during a head-clearing lockdown walk, he came across what had once been a corner shop, but was now empty. He convinced the landlord to give him the lease. He bought secondhand kitchen equipment that would just about do the job. He painted the signage himself because he didn’t have the money to get anyone else to do it, and nailed together the frame of a beach shack within the shop. There are wooden struts painted red and blue, and colourful sheets of corrugated iron playing the part of sloping roofs. There are wooden tables and chairs. Within a few weeks he had enough money to employ four care leavers. As he wrote, “I’m a helper, a changer, and this is what Sugarcane London is about. I am trying to use my company as a vessel for others.” Accordingly, the words “become a part of our story” are painted in his own hand across the front. I thought I would, not just by reporting the gloomy break-in news, or the better fable of the crowdfunder, but by eating there. Because that story starts to wobble if the food doesn’t stand up to examination. It really does. This is Chef Tee’s gentle journey around the islands. From Trinidad comes soft, flaky roti with a deep, sweet and sticky spiced gravy for dunking into and, as ever, if no one is looking, a little light sippage. Although, even if they were looking, no one would really care. It’s not that kind of place. Sip away. Alongside the half jerk chicken for £9, we have the jerk ribs, which have been braised until ready to leave the bone they called home, appropriately drenched in a sweet, hot glaze. Ask for more napkins. We have the curry goat, apparently “cooked in the Dutch pot for four hours the way my nan taught me”. His nan taught him well. There is a fiery power to the gravy, which makes my scalp sweat, and lots of bones to be nibbled clean. The same would be true of the 24-hour slow-braised oxtail, full of fresh spinach leaves now wilting gently in the heat, except that the meat has all but fallen away to make the deepest of stews. I suck at the bones anyway. There is jerk rice and a big bowl of kale and callaloo, to make sure you’ve eaten your greens. This is all comfort food, made by someone who knows a bit about having to find a place of safety and now wants to offer you one, too. We try their cocktails: a Dark ’n’ Stormy for £6.50, and something the colour of candy canes made with pink gin and pink Ting for Valentine’s Day. Both display a generous approach to measures. Mind you, if a little light inebriation is desired, you could miss out the cocktail list and head straight for dessert, which includes a section entitled “Alcohol-soaked cakes”. The ineffably light and crumbly chocolate cake comes doused in almond liqueur. On the side is a pot of their own custard, containing a depth charge of dark rum. Or there’s the bread-and-butter pudding with more dark rum. Chef Tee likes rum. At the bottom of the menu, it says, “No service is added to your bill so please tip so I can buy my staff rum.” Tonight, he says, is one of the first times the kitchen has handled service without him while he works the tables. “They’ve done a terrific job.” They’ve earned both their rum and their tips. Chef Tee is a gentle but charismatic figure, who somehow manages the important business of showing the love to his regulars while getting the dishes out and servicing the delivery drivers who turn up at the door. We fall to talking; there is no space in a small, intimate room like this for any pretence. He knows why I am here and I make it clear how well we have been fed. Chef Tee admits that from the very dark moment in the immediate aftermath of the break-in, business is now good; support from the community has been amazing. I tell him what he has done has been equally amazing. He nods gently and, without any side, says simply, “I’m a care leaver from a disadvantaged background. I’m black and gay, one of the youngest restaurateurs in the country who opened his restaurant during the pandemic by himself with just £3,000. I should be a statistic. Instead, I’ve broken the narrative and the barriers. Despite everything against me, I’m still standing.” In a space this small everyone can hear our conversation. Spontaneously, his customers give him a round of applause. Quite right, too. The Creameries in Chorlton, Greater Manchester, has a new identity. Founding chef Mary-Ellen McTague has handed the restaurant over to her head chef Mike Thomas, who has relaunched it as a southern European restaurant called Campagna at the Creameries. The menu will include palourde clams with chickpeas, cuttlefish stew with braised fennel, pappardelle with beef shin ragù and a hazelnut torte with zabaglione cream. On Sundays there will be a three-course menu for £30. Visit thecreameries.co.uk. The industry body UKHospitality has warned that the sector will need to raise prices over the coming year to cope with rising costs for food and energy and the end of the reduced VAT rate introduced during the pandemic. The organisation surveyed over 340 businesses representing 8,200 outlets. Nearly 50% of respondents said they expected menu price increases of over 10% in 2022, with 15% of them anticipating a rise of more than 20%. Flor, the restaurant and then bakery opened in London’s Borough Market by Jason Lowe and John Ogier of Lyle’s in 2019, has ceased trading. Flor was backed by restaurant group JKS which retains the site. They have announced it will now become a second outpost of the Iranian kebab-focused restaurant Berenjak. At berenjaklondon.com.

2/13/2022,"The documentary photographer David Hoffman took this picture of the market in Sclater Street near Whitechapel in east London in 1977. He had been living in the area since the start of that decade having moved down from York. To begin with, he worked as a truck driver to pay the rent, but, wanting to take pictures full time, he then lived in squats just off Whitechapel Road. The plan, he recalls, “was just to photograph stuff that I thought was interesting or would be important to record. And then I’d wait for people to find me and hopefully pay me money for the pictures.” There were a number of street markets in close proximity in those years, one in Brick Lane, another in Cheshire Street, the main Whitechapel Market, each characterised, Hoffman recalls, by differing levels of desperation. “You would have some people trying to sell a single shoe or a broken pair of glasses,” he says.  Whitechapel Market these days is a far more organised and prospering place, but in the 1970s it was mostly kept going by that determination “to find a way to sell anything and not be broke”. As in this image, it presented, at every turn, little tableaux of lives and homes turned inside out. Looking back, Hoffman wishes he’d paid a bit more attention to what was on offer: “There would be occasional daguerreotypes going for 50p or big bits of Victorian pottery that would probably now be worth a fortune.” Hoffman’s market photographs, collected in a new monograph, preserve a moment in time. The market main is now dominated by Bangladeshi styles and flavours; back then, the first Bengali restaurants were opening in Brick Lane, some supplanting the Jewish tailors and stallholders, who were moving out. Part of Whitechapel Road became a conservation area in 1997, though the market there resists gentrification.
