1/31/2022,"Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, will travel to Moscow on Tuesday in a visit that has drawn criticism from the country’s political opposition and is being watched nervously in other European capitals. Orbán, who has developed a reputation as Vladimir Putin’s closest ally inside the European Union, is due to meet the Russian president just as other EU leaders are trying to hash out a coordinated position on Russia’s menacing moves around Ukraine’s borders.  “In this tense situation, it is simply treasonous to go to Moscow,” said a statement released on Sunday and signed by representatives of the six opposition parties that have joined forces to face Orbán in April elections. Orbán first came to public attention in 1989 when, as a young democracy activist, he called on Soviet troops to leave the country. But during his time as prime minister over the last 12 years he has cultivated warm relations with Putin, at the same time as his relations with Brussels have become ever more fractious. Nathalie Loiseau, the chair of the European parliament’s subcommittee on security and defence, said it was clear Putin was trying to divide Europe. “I sincerely hope that Viktor Orbán is aware of what is at stake, and that he sticks to the EU’s message of unity,” she said at a press conference late last week, according to Hungarian news outlets. Péter Szijjártó, Hungary’s foreign minister, said last week the agenda for the visit would include Hungarian gas purchases from Russia, production of Russia’s Sputnik Covid vaccine in Hungary and discussions on a long-delayed nuclear plant Russia is building in the country. While France and Germany have been notably less hawkish on Russia than the US and Britain, they have loudly condemned the Kremlin’s aggressive military manoeuvres. Orbán, on the other hand, has remained pointedly quiet about the military build-up on Ukraine’s borders, except to say he is “in favour of peace and de-escalation”, in a statement released after a gathering of European far-right leaders in Madrid over the weekend, hosted by Spains’s Vox party. Szijjártó has painted the current Ukraine stand-off as a dispute between Russia and the west in which Hungary wants to take no part, despite the fact that it is a Nato member. “Nobody can request such a thing from us,” Szijjártó told a pro-government newspaper, commenting on demands that Budapest should cool relations with Moscow. Hungary was the first European country to purchase Sputnik, which has not yet been licensed for use by the European Medicines Agency. Budapest has also regularly pushed back against closer cooperation between Ukraine and Nato, ostensibly over concerns about the treatment of the Hungarian minority in the country. In a sign of just how rosy the relationship is with the Kremlin, at a time when most European capitals describe relations as at a worrying low point, last November Putin awarded Szijjártó the Order of Friendship at a ceremony in Moscow. András Simonyi, a former Hungarian ambassador to the US who is now a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council, said that previously there were many people in the Hungarian foreign ministry who were deeply suspicious of Orbán’s friendly behaviour towards Russia, but over the years this has changed, as critics were gradually replaced with loyalists. “Hungary does not have a foreign policy, Viktor Orbán has a foreign policy. Everyone in Orbán’s government is just a staffer, and this is especially true for foreign policy,” he said. Orbán’s recent support for the Bosnian Serb leader, Milorad Dodik, has also raised eyebrows across Europe, and has widely been seen as a favour to Russia. Dodik has in recent months intensified secessionist rhetoric around the Republika Srpska entity inside Bosnia, to the alarm of much of the international community. Orbán flew to the Republika Srpska capital, Banja Luka, in November to meet Dodik, without stopping over in Sarajevo. He has promised to veto any EU sanctions against Dodik. “There isn’t any EU member state doing anything even slightly similar: it’s a systemic abandonment of the EU foreign policy alliance,” said Péter Krekó, who runs the Political Capital thinktank in Budapest. Alongside his clashes with Europe, Orbán also has poor relations with the Biden administration. Hungary was the only EU nation not invited to Biden’s recent democracy summit. Instead, Orbán has retained warm relations with Donald Trump. Earlier this month, Trump endorsed Orbán ahead of the April elections, and there are rumours he may come to Budapest to campaign for the far-right prime minister. The 1956 uprising, which was crushed by Soviet tanks, remains a vivid part of the national consciousness, and is one factor that makes many in the country uneasy about Orbán’s support for Putin, at a time when a further Russian incursion into Ukraine may be possible. “A prime minister who, in such a situation, remains silent and springs up to go to Moscow when he’s signalled to do so with a snap, only to stand on the edge of the carpet in the Kremlin, betrays the interests of both Hungary and Europe,” read the opposition statement.",News/World news,Hungarian PM Orbán to visit ally Putin in Moscow,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/31/viktor-orban-hungarian-pm-vladimir-putin-moscow-russia-visit
1/31/2022,"Joe Rogan has addressed controversy over his Spotify podcast, hours after the streaming service announced a plan to tackle the spread of Covid-19 misinformation. In a 10-minute video posted to Instagram on Sunday night, the comedian and host pledged to “try harder to get people with differing opinions on” and “do my best to make sure I’ve researched these topics”.  “A lot of people … have a distorted perception of what I do,” he said, defending two recent episodes of the Joe Rogan Experience that featured guests who shared Covid conspiracy theories. He called these guests “highly credentialed … people [with] an opinion that’s different from the mainstream narrative.” Rogan framed his podcast – which reaches an estimated 11 million listeners per episode – as “just conversations” which “started off as … having fun and talking”. “It’s become what it is today, which is some out of control juggernaut that I barely have control of,” he said. “Often times I have no idea what I’m gonna talk about until I sit down and talk to people. “I am gonna do my best in the future to balance things out.” He also apologised to Spotify. “I want to thank Spotify for being so supportive during this time, and I’m very sorry that this is happening to them and that they’re taking so much from it.” The episodes sparked a fresh round of furore, including from musicians Neil Young and Joni Mitchell, who pulled their music from Spotify as a result. “I’m not mad at Neil Young,” Rogan said, describing himself as a lifelong fan of the singer. Earlier on Sunday, the chief executive of Spotify, Daniel Ek, released an official statement setting out the streaming platform’s plan to tackle misinformation, as more users publicly unsubscribed from the service, more musicians withdrew their music and the company lost billions of dollars in market value.",Arts/Culture,Joe Rogan pledges to ‘try harder’ after Spotify misinformation controversy,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/31/joe-rogan-pledges-to-try-harder-after-spotify-misinformation-controversy

1/31/2022,"When Ladi Kwali met the British studio potter Michael Cardew in the early 1950s, her traditional hand-built water jars were already well known in Nigeria’s Gwari region. Having spotted her work in the Emir of Abuja’s home, Cardew swiftly invited her to join his local government-backed pottery training centre. There she added modern industry’s wheel and kiln to her toolkit to create thrown tableware, and became a star turn within the touring demonstrations Cardew organised in Europe and America.  She was a phenomenal figure, “taking two cultures in her stride”, explains Jareh Das, the Nigerian-born, UK-based curator of Body Vessel Clay, the forthcoming exhibition teasing out lineages between Black female artists across three generations. Kwali provides the show’s baseline, yet her place in ceramics history is far from straightforward. Also in the exhibition is Bisila Noha, a ceramics artist whose work in Body Vessel Clay looks to pottery’s unsung African mothers. For her, UK museum collections only tend to include Kwali “because of the connection with a white British man, rather than elevating her pieces in themselves”. Das wants the exhibition to bring Kwali out of western patriarchy’s shadow, “to individualise her and where she’s coming from, the stories the pots tell us about her life and culture”. To do so, she draws attention not to Cardew, the British incomer, but to the matrilineal teaching crucial to global pottery traditions. Kwali learned her skills from her aunt and went on to train others, such as Magdalene Odundo, the lauded Kenyan-born British artist known for her swan-necked, swollen-bellied pots. Although they didn’t share a spoken language, Odundo has recalled how she learned from Kwali as a baby might – through touch, not words. “Craft is a language in itself that is universal,” says Noha, who has studied with female potters in Mexico and Morocco. “We can all come together through it, regardless of our background.” At the same time, the exhibition is a reminder that clay can be as edgy and political as it is timeless. Of the younger artists, Phoebe Collings-James’s ceramic torso with body piercings and scarred skin conjures sweaty club nights, Roman armour, tribal markings and war wounds. “I wanted them to be charged with a queered eroticism,” she says. Shawanda Corbett, an artist born with one arm and without legs, creates motley-glazed pots fashioned from tilting spheres. They invite us to imagine what it’s like to inhabit different vessels, different bodies. Jade Montserrat, meanwhile, explores the raw material in its most natural state. In a mud pit on a shooting estate in her home county of Yorkshire, she massages clay over her skin and hair, a Black woman “unearthing and building identity”, she says, as well as raising questions around land, belonging and ownership. It offers a radical conclusion to an exhibition that begins with traditional indigenous pottery. Montserrat’s interest in clay could be the show’s guiding principle. “It’s about making the circuits of energy evident,” she reflects. “It’s about potential.” Ladi Kwali (main picture)The Nigerian potter Ladi Kwali garnered international renown for her fusion of traditional Gwari forms and modern pottery techniques. “Her work went from functional domestic jars into works of art through glazing and the introduction of new technology,” explains curator Jareh Das. Jade MontserratIn this performance for video, Yorkshire artist Jade Montserrat covers her naked body with clay. It was filmed on a shooting estate near where she grew up and “explores Black presence in northern England”. Magdalene OdundoThis acclaimed Kenyan-born British ceramicist studied at the pottery training centre with Ladi Kwali in the early 1970s. “She started making pots in that Gwari style and learned how to hand build,” explains curator Jareh Das. “The experience also influenced her looking closely at pottery traditions in other parts of Africa and the world.” Bisila NohaThe Spanish-Equatorial Guinean ceramicist Bisila Noha first created her bi-part vessels to portray her sense of being “in between countries, culture and heritage”. When she discovered an African potter, Kouame Kakaha, had used similar forms, it inspired her ongoing research project into “the unnamed women of clay; our shared mothers and grandmothers”. Phoebe Collings-JamesWhile making her ceramic torsos, Phoebe Collings-James says that “Makonde and Yoruba ceremonial body masks featuring pregnant bodies and Roman armour with door knocker nipple rings were all recent memories”. Her interests include “our clumsy signifiers of race, class, sexuality and genders, and how awkwardly or disobediently we may wear them”.

1/31/2022,"In 1959, transatlantic travel was still a niche privilege, not least for a young, single, working-class woman. Shirley Collins owed her ticket to New York on the SS United States to her romance with the American folklorist Alan Lomax, whom she had met in London a couple of years previously. She was an ambitious 21-year-old folk singer from Sussex, he a celebrated song collector and musician 20 years her senior. Lomax had been in Europe for several years, effectively in exile from the anti-communist witch-hunt that had blacklisted musicians such as Pete Seeger, alongside Hollywood stars including Orson Welles and Charlie Chaplin. Even when collecting Spanish folk songs, Lomax had found himself shadowed by “the black crows” of Franco’s guardia. After returning to the US, Lomax invited Collins to join him on a song-hunting trip through the deep south, a journey memorably recounted in this memoir – reissued after 15 years out of print, albeit without the atmospheric photographs of the first edition. It offers a vivid and sometimes shocking portrait of a country yet to confront the civil rights era. The couple’s encounters ranged from pentecostal choirs (both black and white) and hellfire preachers to blind fiddlers and mountain ballad singers, some of them familiar to Lomax from a previous trip with his father. For Collins, this was a new world of epic landscapes, rattlesnakes, racism and nocturnal gunfire. St Leonards-on-Sea it wasn’t.  In Arkansas the pair recorded singer Almeda Riddle, who delivered a poignant version of The Merry Golden Tree, a British naval ballad from “the ocean she’d never seen in her life”. In search of the Memphis Jug Band, who had been a popular outfit in the 1920s and 30s, they found a scene of quarrelling musicians and whiskey-soaked squalor. In Mississippi they met (and “discovered”) 57-year-old Fred McDowell, who arrived in dungarees after a day in the cotton fields before proving himself a formidable blues guitarist, one who went on to enjoy professional glory. Also in Mississippi was the notorious Parchman Farm penitentiary, in whose fields Lomax recorded prisoners hollering work songs as they toiled, while Collins endured the unwanted attention of a guard. Decades later, one tune, Po’ Lazarus, would appear on the bestselling soundtrack of the Coen brothers’ southern jaunt O Brother, Where Art Thou?, leading Lomax’s daughter, Anna, to track down the lead singer, James Carter, by then 76 and living in Chicago, so that she could present him with a cheque for $20,000. Interspersed with Collins’s account of this “southern journey” (though New York, Chicago, California and the Newport festival also feature) are chapters describing her upbringing in Hastings. The Collins family were poor but resilient, and on her mother’s side arty and politically active, with uncles who were painters and writers. It was a warm, extended family whose lives were full of singing. Her father was a milkman for a local farmer until conscription took him into the army. He survived the second world war but his marriage did not. Collins and her big sister, Dolly (who would become a composer and accompanist to Collins), had much of their childhood claimed by wartime. Twice evacuated, they returned to Hastings to watch dogfights above the Channel and shelter beneath the stairs from deadly “doodlebugs” (V1 rockets). As postwar teenagers their screen idol was Laurence Olivier (the pair learned chunks of Hamlet to imitate him), their favourite singers Frankie Laine and Johnnie Ray, listened to on the radio while their mother was at work – as a communist she thought American pop was a corrupting influence (a view extant in some folk circles). The alternating chapters make for a jarring chronology but provide some striking contrasts. Food is a constant subtext, austerity-era Britain with its powdered eggs and watery trifles and a new world of steak, chicken, exotic produce (avocados!) and, in New York, pizza. At 18, Collins left home for London and the nascent folk revival, which is all too briefly described here, along with a capsule account of her later career, her ascent to doyenne of the folk scene, the loss of her singing voice and its recent, happy return, episodes explored more fully in her 2018 memoir All in the Downs, which followed her return to music making with 2016’s Lodestar album and her rediscovery by a new audience. Collins’s affair with Lomax didn’t endure (though in 1960 he came to England and proposed), but their mutual affection remained. Her American adventure receded into memory, but her experience reinforced her resolve to become “an English singer of English songs”, a description that applies to this day.

1/31/2022,"“We have to stop this right now,” Xavi Hernández said. The day he took over as Barcelona manager Xavi had insisted that “in his right position, worked on well, Ousmane Dembélé could be the best in the world” and that extending the Frenchman’s contract was a “priority”. Sitting alongside him, a little giddy at the opening of a new era, was Joan Laporta. The Barça president, who had declared Dembélé “better than [Kylian] Mbappé” a week earlier, flashed a knowing smile. “Understood,” he said, and everybody laughed. More than two months later, no progress has been made. Months of negotiations achieved nothing except mutual accusations. Dembélé could already talk to other clubs and although Xavi had wanted him to stay, there was no deal, the gap between offer and demand too great. Barcelona concluded he didn’t really want to stay and that it was time to cut their losses. Xavi handed him an ultimatum: “renew your contract with us or go now.” Or, you know, don’t.  It is 12 days since the Barcelona manager told Dembélé to leave and 11 since he left him out of the squad, warning that he would not play again. It is also 11 days since the director of football, Mateu Alemany, concluded that Dembélé didn’t want to stay and should go. “Before 31 January,” Alemany said. That, you might have noticed, is on Monday but Dembélé is still at Barcelona, if not on the pitch, the central figure in both this window and the club’s immediate future. Unless talks with Paris Saint-Germain that started on Sunday reach a positive conclusion, deadline day will almost certainly end with Dembélé at the club. The day after delivering his ultimatum, Xavi followed through on the threat, guided more by the club than his own inclinations, and left Dembélé out – a decision repeated four days later. That morning, Alemany made the club’s position public: Dembélé “is not committed to our future” and must leave. Instead, Dembélé released a statement expressing his determination to resist and revealing he felt mistreated. The players’ union warned that leaving a footballer in the stands in a bid to force a new deal was “illegal”. After “four years” of “endlessly reading things” without defending himself, of “gossip” and “shameful lies…aimed only at hurting me”, Dembélé had had enough. He wouldn’t accept people talking for him or agent Moussa Sissoko, or questioning his commitment. And he certainly wasn’t going to be forced into any decision. “I am not a man who cheats and still less a man in the habit of giving in to blackmail,” he warned. “From today, it’s over.” His time at Barcelona is over too. If the statement theoretically left a door open by insisting that, contrary to what the club said, “there are negotiations”, words like blackmail are not easy to retreat from. The question is when it ends and how. The deadline the club set – midnight on Monday – is one they cannot enforce. Xavi had known that: “Dembélé is the one holding the frying pan by the handle.” That weekend Dembélé didn’t turn up to training, claiming gastroenteritis – the exact reason Xavi once said was the footballer’s go-to excuse. There have been talks between Sissoko and Xavi which hinted at a rapprochement. There has been public theatre too, a certain silliness to it all, not least when Sissoko’s phone rang as he passed TV cameras which caught “Leonardo, PSG” on his screen. Towards the end of his statement, Dembélé declared: “Surely love is a kind of blackmail”. The man who Lionel Messi had said “can’t speak” had not only spoken for the first time, but turned all philosophical on them. Exactly what he meant is unclear, which was oddly appropriate: a lot of this doesn’t make much sense. The club that wanted him to stay has told him to leave. The man who seemingly wants to leave, is determined to stay. The man who assured his manager he intended to continue, isn’t. The club’s decision not to play him hurts them more than the player. Dembélé has never been as important as he is right now, and that’s a strange kind of important. The blunt, uncomfortable, sad conclusion is that he has rarely been important at all; the absurdity of all this is that he doesn’t matter this much, or shouldn’t. Calling him better than Mbappé doesn’t help to convince him to accept a lower salary and when Laporta said it, mostly people just laughed. Dembélé could be the best player in the world, Xavi had said. Could be, not is. This is his fifth season.There have been glimpses of a superior talent but his presence has been fleeting, almost incidental. A transfer fee of €140m, 12 injuries, a third of league games started, 31 goals. Choose a standout moment, and many fans would recall that miss against Liverpool. There is a cruelty in players like Dembélé standing accused of suffering more injuries than anyone else. But the truth is he never really felt part of things at Barcelona. This year he might have done. He had affection, a manager keen to work with him, and departures made him the differential talent. He had a team that actually needed him. A club that needed him, too – even if it was to leave. And that’s the key. Trapped by his salary and his potential, Dembélé is simultaneously a symbol of the crisis that engulfs Barcelona and their potential way out of it, a problem inherited from their past and a hope for their future, Dembélé has become the player who conditions everything. This is all of their futures, not just his. An agreement on a contract extension would have secured a player the coach called “fundamental” and spread his salary and amortisations over a longer period to allow for other players to arrive too. It didn’t happen, so they gave up on that and tried to make him go, seeking a sale or at least a saving that would permit short-term manoeuvrability, signings lined up in anticipation. But Dembélé won’t be “blackmailed” into staying or going and now here they are, one day left, still waiting on him. It is a familiar feeling, going back five years now but at least it is coming to a finish. The best-case scenario sees them secure a last-minute exit. If not, he stays and waits until the summer, disappearing from the field, a forgotten man once again. Unless they change their minds once the window actually closes, backing down from a threat no longer of any value and choosing to use an asset they could do with, Ousmane Dembélé will never play for them again, his total stopped at 129 often forgettable games. Instead, he will sit there, alone, watching them play without him, his Barcelona career sadly ending much the way it went.",Sport/Football,Everyone is a loser in the messy saga of Ousmane Dembélé and Barcelona,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/31/everyone-a-loser-messy-saga-ousmane-dembele-barcelona
1/31/2022,"Ryanair has warned of a “hugely uncertain” financial outlook, even as the budget airline geared up to run more flights this summer than before the coronavirus pandemic struck. The Irish-listed carrier made a loss of €96m (£80m) in the last three months of 2021, although that was a significant improvement over the €321m loss in the same period in 2020, when strict international travel restrictions were still in place. Revenues quadrupled compared with last year, it said in its third-quarter results update.  Ryanair added that the first three months of 2022 will require “significant price stimulation at lower prices” to attract customers, which could hit profits. That uncertainty, plus the possibility of new restrictions if another variant of concern were to arise, meant the airline left unchanged its guidance for a loss in the year ending in March, at €250m to €450m – a wider than usual range. The airline blamed “media hysteria” over the Omicron variant for missing its target of 11 million passengers in December, instead carrying 9.5 million. The Omicron variant has proved to be more infectious than earlier dominant variants but widespread vaccines have meant that many governments, including in the UK, have started to loosen some of the stricter travel requirements. That has allowed Ryanair to plan for a summer bookings boom, with a schedule for 2022 that is 114% of 2019, the last year unaffected by the pandemic. It also plans to grow to 225 million passengers a year by 2026, an increase from the previous prediction of 200 million, compared with a pre-Covid-19 peak of 149 million. Michael O’Leary, Ryanair’s chief executive, said: “This outturn is hugely sensitive to any further positive or negative Covid news flow and so we would caution all shareholders to expect further Covid disruptions before we here in Europe and the rest of the world can finally declare that the Covid crisis is behind us.” In the longer term, Ryanair is banking on a big increase in the number of flights, using its relative financial strength to win market share. It has taken delivery of 41 Boeing 737 Max aircraft following years of delays after design flaws caused two fatal crashes. O’Leary has repeatedly described the Boeing 737 Max as a “gamechanger” for the airline, offering lower costs and lower carbon emissions per flight. However, it acknowledged that the 50% growth over the next five years would be accompanied by only a 16% reduction in fuel use per new plane. It hopes to cut fuel use per passenger over the next decade but emissions reduction plans will heavily depend on synthetic fuels, which are not currently available at scale. Gerald Khoo, an analyst at Liberum, a stockbroker, said: “Ryanair is positioned for a strong recovery, with planned summer capacity at 114% of 2019 levels.”",News/Business,Ryanair prepares price cuts as it warns of ‘hugely uncertain’ financial outlook,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/31/ryanair-price-cuts-more-flights-loss
1/31/2022,"Transfer deadline day is essentially the last day of term for the Rumour Mill, but instead of bringing in our favourite VHS videos and avoiding any work, we’re dialling today’s speculation up to potentially irresponsible levels before the window slams shut tonight. The name of Álvaro Morata, the Spain international who is currently on loan at Juventus from Atlético Madrid, has emerged as a potential goal-getting option for Arsenal. The Gunners coach Miguel Molina reportedly got on the blower to Morata over the weekend to try and convince him to sign. Arsenal have not completely given up hope of taking Alexander Isak from Real Sociedad, but the Spanish club remain fixated on the 22-year-old’s £75m release clause.  Mikel Arteta is also being linked with a late move for Everton’s Dominic Calvert-Lewin. It seems unlikely the Merseyside club would part with a key player but as Arteta has told us, the world’s best definitely do want to join Arsenal. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, meanwhile, is still having a chat with crisis club Barcelona about leaving north London. Ruben Loftus-Cheek of Chelsea, Dele Alli of Tottenham and Idrissa Gueye of Paris Saint-Germain are all targets for the new Everton gaffer Frank Lampard. Lampard is an admirer of Loftus-Cheek following his tenure at Stamford Bridge while Alli has failed to win over Antonio Conte at Tottenham. Gueye, who left Everton in 2019, progressed to the last four of the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal 12 hours ago. Manchester United, Arsenal, Tottenham and Aston Villa are all in the hunt for Brighton’s Yves Bissouma, but the Seagulls will demand north of £30m, in fact more like £35m, for the dynamic central midfielder. The feature about Phil Jones ageing like a fine wine at Bordeaux would have written itself, but unfortunately the Manchester United defender’s potential loan deal to Ligue 1 has fallen through. Reports state the French club were not prepared to guarantee him the game time he wanted. Eddie Howe wants to further bolster his Newcastle squad in the battle against relegation from the Premier League, and Aston Villa’s Matt Targett is on his radar. The Magpies had looked at Bayer Leverkusen’s Mitchel Bakker and Rogério of Sassuolo but are now firmly targeting Targett. Heading further north, Rangers are close to signing Lechia Gdansk right-back Mateusz Zukowski. The 20-year-old is out of contract at the end of the season and has been stalling on signing a new deal in Poland so the fee won’t be much. The Gers have also reportedly fought off a host of European rivals, including Arsenal, to sign Romanian teenager Kevin Ciubotaru. Dejan Kulusevski flew to London last night to complete his move to Tottenham. Much is being made of the fact the Juventus attacker told reporters: “I had a very good time, I hope to return one day,” of his time at the Bianconeri. Mind you, he was asked if he had a message for Juventus fans by a dedicated Juventus reporter, so he was hardly going to say: “I hope you get relegated.” The Sweden international will have a medical today and is due to join on an 18-month loan with a mandatory purchase for about €40m, plus add-ons. And finally: West Ham are close to signing the Marseille defender Duje Caleta-Car, are being linked with Liverpool forward Divock Origi, having already had two offers for Leeds’s Kalvin Phillips rejected.

1/31/2022,"Political journalist and commentator Peter van Onselen has conceded his column criticising Grace Tame for being “rude” to the prime minister “probably” didn’t need to be written. In a podcast interview, van Onselen said he didn’t resile from his view but said expressing his disapproval of the outgoing Australian of the Year’s actions made him the story and “as bad as Grace Tame”.  Last week photos and video of Tame, an advocate for survivors of sexual assault, went viral following her frosty arrival at a function at the Lodge. She refused to smile alongside Scott Morrison during a staged photo-op. Van Onselen wrote in the Australian newspaper that Tame had been “ungracious, rude and childish” suggesting if her disdain for Morrison was such that she “can’t even muster basic and common courtesy, then just don’t go”. Guardian Australia’s Amy Remeikis and van Onselen’s co-host Carrie Bickmore confronted him about the column on The Project. Van Onselen has told the Critical Line Item podcast that he did not resile from his view of Tame’s behaviour because: “I do think it was rude, I do think it was impolite, [and] unnecessary.” Van Onselen claimed the “silent majority” of people agreed with him but the “loudest people don’t”. “They didn’t change my mind. I’m still very firm, personally, of the view that [Tame’s actions were] uncalled for ... and inappropriate and she shouldn’t have done it,” he said. “However, on reflection, I also think it was also probably unnecessary for me to bother to write the opinion piece – I can just think it.” Van Onselen insisted that he did not regret the column because of blowback. “Seeing how strongly people feel about it doesn’t change my view, but it probably has changed my view on whether it needed to be written. “What’s the point in saying it? In a sense me, on my side of the ledger, deciding to write about it, became me being – people won’t like this – as bad as Grace Tame choosing to act the way she acted, which I’m critical of.” Remeikis had said the column was “devastating to so many people”. “Women constantly have to come out talk about their trauma, talk about their position, talk about not being taken seriously … we’re constantly being told how we should act, who we should think about and who perhaps should be seen in our place,” she said. Bickmore also criticised van Onselen for writing Tame acted “as a child”, noting that Tame had been unable to be a child as a teenager when she “was preyed upon by a man and lost part of herself in that”. Van Onselen said the incident demonstrated the “problem” of the “blurred line” between being a journalist and commentator. Van Onselen then defended comments he made on Insiders in March 2021 that “on the macro level” he was pleased women were coming forward to complain of sexual abuse to get justice but “at the micro level … if it’s someone you know and they claim they’re innocent, boy, it’s a difficult issue”. #AnnabelCrabb @annabelcrabb @vanOnselenPWhat Peter van Onselen's final observation renders Annabel Crabb utterly speechless with disgust. #insiders pic.twitter.com/3iZhyhXOOR Van Onselen told the podcast his comments were an “outright truism” but accepted the “wording and timing” could have been better. “Yes, on reflection that’s something I could have done differently,” he said. Van Onselen then paraphrased himself that while on the “big picture level people want improvements” on gender “but it’s an obvious truism at a personal level, ie the micro” that it’s difficult if a friend says they didn’t do something they are accused of. “That’s just a truism.”",News/Australia news,‘I can just think it’: Peter van Onselen admits controversial Grace Tame column was ‘probably unnecessary’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/31/i-can-just-think-it-peter-van-onselen-admits-controversial-grace-tame-column-was-probably-unnecessary
1/31/2022,"Australia’s most senior defence official was poised to inform the Morrison government of “good progress” on the now-dumped French submarine project, after receiving advice that the proposed next phase of work was “affordable and acceptable”. Documents obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws reveal Australia’s defence leadership received positive advice about the project, just weeks before it was scrapped in favour of the Aukus pact with the US and the UK.  The defence department secretary, Greg Moriarty, promised in an email to colleagues on 30 August to “ensure that the good progress to date is part of the advice we take to government” and said it would also be expressed in a meeting between Australian and French ministers the same day. The Australian government’s announcement two weeks later that it was turning to the US and the UK for help to acquire at least eight nuclear-powered submarines sparked a serious diplomatic rift with France, which complained it had been “stabbed in the back” and “betrayed”. The newly released paper trail shows Gregory Sammut, the general manager of submarines at the defence department, told his superiors that France’s Naval Group had made an updated offer for the next phase of work on 23 August. “Notwithstanding the due diligence we are exercising in reviewing the offer, it is affordable and acceptable, and compliant with contractual terms and conditions, and the statement of work,” Sammut wrote on 27 August. Sammut also said “a sound integrated master schedule” had been established, with the first of the conventional diesel-electric Attack-class submarines forecast to be delivered “within the window August 2033 to February 2035”. Prime minister, Scott Morrison, said in September the first of the nuclear-powered submarines should be in the water by about 2040 - although all of the key details are still subject to an 18-month joint study with the US and the UK. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning While some of Sammut’s 27 August email was redacted on the basis that it would reveal a cabinet deliberation or decision, it ends with a comment that Naval Group had worked “collaboratively with Defence since then to achieve substantial progress, and there are no extreme program strategic risks”. His email was addressed to Moriarty, the defence secretary, who had helped oversee a parallel review into Australia’s submarine capability needs, and the message was copied to others including the chief of navy, Vice-Admiral Michael Noonan. Moriarty replied on 31 August to thank Sammut “for this comprehensive update” and to acknowledge “that this has not been an easy period for any of you”. Moriarty wrote that the fact the department had “a high confidence” schedule, a “credible” cost estimate, and an “affordable” offer for the next stage reflected well on the team’s leadership and its good working relationship with Naval Group. “I will ensure that the good progress to date is part of the advice we take to Government, and you will hear that message repeated in the 2+2 with France and in other engagements,” Moriarty told Sammut. This 2+2 meeting between the French and Australian defence and foreign ministers would later be at the heart of French accusations they were blindsided by the ultimate decision to scrap the project in favour of the Aukus pact. The documents released by the defence department on Monday also show Sammut briefed a key Defence panel – known as the Naval Shipbuilding Coordination Group – about progress at least twice in August 2021. Notes prepared for the meeting on 10 August say that Naval Group had been “formally advised that Government will need to consider the revised offer for the next phase before Defence is permitted to fund that work under contract”. According to notes prepared for a meeting of the same panel on 31 August, Defence’s work to establish “a sound integrated master schedule, a credible program cost estimate and an affordable and acceptable offer for the next phase of work” had been completed “with the collaborative support of Naval Group”. There is a table listing a number of “current risks and challenges” as either “medium” or “high” – but the specifics are redacted on the cabinet confidentiality clause. Sammut’s email to defence leadership on 27 August estimates the updated total cost of the French submarine program as $46.4bn in 2016 constant dollars – a way of describing the cost that assumes a dollar has the same buying power over time. He wrote that this figure “remains within the original acquisition cost estimate of $50 billion in 2016 constant dollars announced at the outset of the Attack class submarine program in April 2016”. Defence officials have said the total estimated cost of the French submarine program was $88bn in “out-turned dollars” – another measure that takes into account inflation and foreign exchange rate variations. This larger “out-turned” figure has been more widely quoted in media reporting. Moriarty told Senate estimates in October the public discussion about the French submarines had been “largely inaccurate” and “there was no cost blowout”. He said the project had been terminated “because our requirements have changed, not because of the poor performance” by either Naval Group or the combat system contractor Lockheed Martin Australia. Previously released documents show the defence department wrote to Naval Group a week before the contract was cancelled, acknowledging the successful completion of at least one requirement for moving to the next stage. Hours before the announcement, the department cautioned Naval Group that its achievement of a key contractual milestone did “not provide any authorisation to continue work”.

1/31/2022,"Queensland’s human rights commissioner says schools cannot use contracts to avoid their responsibilities under anti-discrimination law, after one of the state’s largest religious schools sent families enrolment agreements that imply transgender students will only be recognised by their “biological sex”. The “statement of faith” required for enrolment at Citipointe Christian College lists “homosexual acts” alongside bestiality, incest and paedophilia as “immoral” and “offensive to God”.  It also includes statements that each person should identify “with the gender that God bestowed”. The Queensland human rights commissioner, Scott McDougall, released a statement on Wednesday after media reports about Citipointe’s enrolment contract. “Schools cannot contract out of their duties under discrimination laws by asking parents or students to agree to discriminatory terms,” McDougall said. He said the Queensland Anti-Discrimination Act does not permit religious schools to refuse enrolment based on gender identity or sexuality, or discriminate against existing students. “Expelling, disciplining or otherwise treating a student unfavourably because of these characteristics is unlawful discrimination in Queensland. “A school policy that requires a trans or gender diverse young person to be treated as their sex assigned at birth, or that requires a young person to hide or deny their sexuality, is likely to amount to unlawful discrimination.” There are some concerns the Citipointe contract was a provocation ahead of likely debate in federal parliament about a proposed religious discrimination bill. Matilda Alexander, president of the LGBTI Legal Service, said Queensland anti-discrimination laws were stronger than federal ones. “This demonstrates what schools are likely to do after that law is passed – a licence to discriminate against very vulnerable young people and their families who just need access to education, they just need support,” Alexander said. Alexander encouraged anyone who believed the contracts discriminated against them to contact the LGBTI Legal Service for free legal advice. Citipointe is widely considered Brisbane’s equivalent of the Sydney megachurch Hillsong. Initially the Christian Outreach Centre, the church has satellite ministries in Nashville, Auckland and central Bulgaria. Like Hillsong, it has its own Christian music operation, Citipointe Worship. The school, which occupies part of Citipointe’s extensive campus in the Brisbane suburb of Carindale, claims on its website to be “one of Queensland’s largest independent schools, with a student population of over 1720”. A petition demanding the school recall the enrolment contracts, which parents must sign, had more than 50,000 signatures on Monday morning. The “statement of faith” section in the Citipointe college enrolment contracts is an excerpt from the constitution of the Christian Outreach Centre. It states that: “We believe that God intends sexual intimacy to occur only between a man and a woman who are married to each other. “We believe that any form of sexual immorality (including but not limited to: adultery, fornication, homosexual acts, bisexual acts, bestiality, incest, paedophilia and pornography) is sinful and offensive to God and is destructive to human relationships and society. “We believe that God created human beings as male or female.” The contract also states that “I/we agree that, where distinctions are made between male and female (inclusive of, but not limited to, for example, uniforms, presentation, terminology, use of facilities and amenities, participation in sporting events and accommodation) such distinctions will be applied on the basis of the individual’s biological sex.” The office of the school principal, pastor Brian Mulheran, said he was not available to answer questions on Monday. Mulheran – who in 2012 claimed he was totally cured from a long-term debilitating sickness by the prayer of a healing pastor – said in a statement that the school does not judge students on their sexuality or gender identity and a decision about their enrolment would not be made on that basis. “We have always held these Christian beliefs and we have tried to be fair and transparent to everyone in our community by making them clear in the enrolment contract,” Mulheran said. “We are seeking to maintain our Christian ethos and to give parents and students the right to make an informed choice about whether they can support and embrace our approach to Christian education. “We believe each individual is created in the image of God, with dignity and worth equal to every other person. We unequivocally love and respect all people regardless of their lifestyle and choices, even if those choices are different to our beliefs and practice.” McDougall said all students and their families should feel that they belong in their school community. “The commission appreciates that most educators in Queensland actively work to support and include LGBTIQ+ students, understanding that student wellbeing and academic performance suffers when a student is not accepted for who they are at school. “A sense of belonging is conducive to an environment in which students feel confident to participate, and which enables them to reach their full potential.”",News/Australia news,‘Unlawful discrimination’: Queensland rights commissioner says schools can’t use student contracts to avoid laws,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/31/unlawful-discrimination-queensland-rights-commissioner-says-schools-cant-use-student-contracts-to-avoid-laws
1/31/2022,"Downing Street appears likely to drop its policy of dismissing frontline NHS and care staff in England who refuse Covid vaccinations, a minister has strongly indicated, after nursing and care organisations called for this to happen. A decision would be made “in the course of the next few days”, according to Simon Clarke, the chief secretary to the Treasury. He said the lower severity of the Omicron variant of Covid did “open a space” for the policy to be reversed.  The apparent imminent U-turn came as the Royal College of Nursing argued that both the change in severity from Omicron and the number of NHS vacancies meant the mandatory vaccination policy should be dropped. The National Care Association said it would also welcome a change of policy, while warning that many unvaccinated care staff had already lost their jobs in the run-up to the 1 April deadline. The Guardian reported this month that an internal document drawn up by the Department of Health and Social Care said the growing evidence on the Omicron variant cast doubts over the new law’s “rationality” and “proportionality”. Asked about reports of a change to the policy, Clarke told Sky News that ministers had hoped to find “the right balance between having the maximum impact for measures that support public safety in the face of the virus, but also have the minimum impact in terms of our wider freedoms as a society”. He added: “And it’s in that context that a decision was made last autumn to make sure we went ahead with the mandatory vaccination policy, and that was because, obviously, we had the Delta variant, which was extremely dangerous, and was taking a huge toll on our society, and we had to make sure that people going into hospital, very vulnerable people, whether they had Covid or another condition which required treatment, weren’t going to be faced with an increased risk of infection on the wards. “We continue to monitor that situation very, very closely. What we know about Omicron is that it is much, much more transmissible but less severe – any decision that is taken this week will reflect that reality. “I can’t pre-judge the decision that is going to be made but obviously we do recognise those realities, and that does open a space where we can look at this again.” Asked when health and care staff would know, Clarke said: “There will be a decision made in the course of the next few days, and that [the lower severity of Omicron] opens the window for us to look at it.” Patricia Marquis, the director for England for the Royal College of Nursing, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We would say that Covid is still a serious disease and would absolutely urge all nursing staff to get vaccinated but the situation has changed in that Omicron is serious for those who are unvaccinated but actually overall as a country things have improved. “But the most important issue for us right now is the fact that there are so many nursing vacancies already, it makes no sense to risk losing thousands of registered nurses and healthcare support workers from both health and also what’s been lost from social care, which actually puts patients at more risk than not having nurses at all so we think the situation needs to be reviewed urgently and quick decisions need to be made before we start to lose people from the system.” Nadra Ahmed, the chair of the National Care Association, told BBC Breakfast the sector had lost about 40,000 staff, and she was “saddened for all the people who may have lost their jobs needlessly” as a result of the vaccination policy. She said: “I think we’re really happy for our NHS colleagues if this is what’s going to happen because it’s an unnecessary burden, and persuasion will bring us to the same outcome.”",News/Society,No 10 set for U-turn over mandatory Covid jabs for NHS staff in England,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/31/covid-mandatory-jabs-nhs-staff-england-omicron-u-turn
