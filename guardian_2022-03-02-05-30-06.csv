3/2/2022,"A massive, fast-moving cloud of ash hundreds of metres tall and several kilometres wide has swept over southern Paraguay, as storms blew debris from wildfires raging in neighbouring Argentina following two years of severe drought. The colossal bank of smog enveloped Asunción, Paraguay’s capital, late on Monday, shrouding the city and its suburbs in a thick, grey haze with the aroma of burnt vegetation. Forecasters warned residents to stay inside to avoid breathing in the smoky miasma. In the southern district of Ayolas, where fires have been blazing since early January, conditions were so dark that birds went up into the trees to roost, thinking it was night, said Ray Mendoza, a volunteer firefighter. “In a question of minutes the city fell into complete darkness,” Mendoza said. “It’s the first time in 20 to 25 years doing this that I’ve seen something like it.” An index measuring particulate matter in the air shot up from single digits to over 180, close to levels deemed “very unhealthy” by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Striking videos on social media showed the towering wall of dust and soot racing over the Paraná River from the province of Corrientes in northern Argentina – 250km (155 miles) south of Asunción – and smothering beaches, farms and highways. Motorists were forced to turn on their headlights and pull over as visibility dropped to near-zero and darkness fell in the early afternoon. “Lord Jesus, my God,” one passenger exclaimed. A weather front of cold air from the south acted “like a broom,” explained Eduardo Dose, a Paraguayan hydrologist, scooping up soot from burnt pastures and forests as well as dust from drought-stricken wetlands. Strong winds then channelled the choking cloud up the Paraguay River and directly to the capital. Violent storms are normal for the sub-tropical region, Dose added. “But if we’re going to talk about what causes the fires, there we can talk about climate change.” Massive fires have been raging across Argentina for almost two months. Nearly a million hectares in Corrientes have been burned, an area the size of Puerto Rico or Cyprus. Blazes continue to burn in nine of Argentina’s 23 provinces. Scientists point to a once-in-a-century drought – in turn linked to the global climate crisis, the la Niña weather pattern, and rampant deforestation for soybean plantations and cattle ranches in the Amazon and beyond – as lying behind the blazes. Monoculture pine plantations have also served as highly combustible fuel for both accidental and human-made conflagrations. “Scorching summer temperatures, high winds, and dry vegetation have combined to turn parts of South America into a tinderbox,” said Nasa in a report with satellite imagery of the fires in Corrientes in mid-February. The fires are decimating irreplaceable wildlife in Argentina’s vast, northeastern wetlands, killing and displacing jaguars, anteaters, capybaras, birds and amphibians. Roughly half of Parque Iberá, an ambitious rewilding project covering about 1,600 sq km in the far north of Corrientes close to the Paraguayan border, was lost after lightning struck the dried-out nature reserve. “It is with a heavy heart that I share the devastation that wildfires are causing in the Iberá wetlands,” tweeted Kristine Tompkins, president of Tompkins Conservation, which has created 13 national parks, including Iberá, across Chile and Argentina. With soybean and cattle products representing over a third of Argentina’s exports, the government has been slow to respond. A bill to protect the wetlands was withdrawn from congress by the progressive government of Alberto Fernández in December. Social media influencer Santi Maratea raised almost $1m to buy fire trucks and equipment for volunteer firemen in Corrientes, who are shouldering most the work. Volunteers have also been struggling to put out fires in the district of Ayolas, southern Paraguay, which contributed to the ash cloud. “We’ve had some rain in recent days but it’s not enough to put out all the fires in the area,” said Mendoza.

3/2/2022,"The House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack has issued new subpoenas to lawyers for Donald Trump suspected to be involved in efforts to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory. The subpoenas – authorized hours before Biden’s first state of the union address – targeted documents and testimony from Cleta Mitchell, Kurt Olsen, Katherine Freiss, Phillip Kline, Kenneth Chesebro and the pro-Trump One America News host Christina Bobb. “The select committee is seeking information about attempts to disrupt or delay the certification of electoral votes and any efforts to corruptly change the outcome of the 2020 election,” said Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the panel. “The six individuals we’ve subpoenaed today all have knowledge related to those matters and will help the select committee better understand all the various strategies employed to potentially affect the outcome of the election,” Thompson said. The subpoenas reflect the panel’s focus on Trump’s schemes to stop Biden’s certification from taking place, so that the former president’s associates could buy time to co-opt state legislatures to send Trump slates of electors to return him to office.

3/2/2022,"There has been a big rise in untrained, unscrupulous and untraceable “ghosts” making thousands of pounds a month administering Botox or fillers in people’s homes and abandoning clients when things go wrong, a campaign group has said. The issue is a critical one, an expert has said, which the government has failed to address in its proposed new legislation to introduce a licence for non-surgical cosmetic procedures. “We’re very disappointed that the government has ignored the evidence we gave them about these ‘ghosts’ and the serious and permanent damage they do to their clients,” said Ashton Collins, director of Save Face, a national, government-approved register of accredited non-surgical treatment practitioners. During lockdown, said Collins, there was a dramatic rise in adverts for “at home” cosmetic procedures on social media. The only contact clients have with these practitioners is their social media account and a mobile number. “These laypeople have literally no idea what they’re doing: at best, they might have watched a few videos on YouTube,” said Collins, who submitted evidence to the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) on what should be in the new legislation. “After a couple of days, when things start to go wrong and the client needs their help, they disappear, shutting down their social media accounts and disposing of their untraceable pay-as-you-go phone,” she said. “They disappear, leaving clients, who have quite often suffered serious and permanent harm at their hands, to desperately seek help from someone who might be just as unscrupulous,” said Collins. “They, of course, simply open a new social media account and get a new mobile phone – then go on to target further clients. They have no fear of being caught, because they can’t be.” Sajid Javid, the health secretary, has said that people administering Botox or fillers will be required to have a licence under new laws after an “unacceptable” rise in reports of botched cosmetic procedures in the UK. “Far too many people have been left emotionally and physically scarred” when things have gone wrong, he said. The legislation to protect against rogue practitioners will make it an offence to perform such non-surgical work without a licence. It will aim to bring in consistent standards that people carrying out non-surgical cosmetic procedures must meet, as well as setting out hygiene and safety standards for premises. In the Commons on Tuesday, Laura Trott, Conservative MP for Sevenoaks, asked Javid how the “proposed licensing machine will keep pace with the rapidly changing landscape of these treatments?” Javid said the “details of the regime will be set out in regulations, meaning it will be flexible, it will be agile and it will change in response to changes in the cosmetics industry”. Minister for patient safety Maria Caulfield said the amendment is the “next step on the road to effective regulation of non-surgical cosmetic procedures in England”. She added: “The spread of images on social media has contributed to an increase in demand for cosmetic procedures such as Botox and fillers. “While these can be administered safely, we are seeing an unacceptable rise in people being left physically and mentally scarred from poorly performed procedures.” The all-party parliamentary group on beauty, aesthetics and wellbeing carried out a year-long investigation into the industry. Carolyn Harris, the group’s co-chair, said: “We found that the regulation of cosmetic treatments remains fragmented, obscure and out of date, meaning anyone can carry out any treatment, anywhere, with next to no restrictions on what qualifications they must have to do so. “This has left consumers at risk and undermined the industry’s ability to develop.” Harris welcomed the proposed new legislation but added: “A licensing framework set in law is an important step in the right direction, however this must be underpinned by mandated national minimum standards for practitioner training.” Save Face has seen complaints increase from 378 in 2017 to 2,083 in 2020. In one of the most serious cases, a woman said she had such severe wounds from treatment that she contracted sepsis and ended up in hospital in a coma for five days. But the number of complaints was likely to be the “tip of the iceberg”, said Collins: “There are lots of severe medical side-effects that come along with these treatments – but because they’re classed as beauty treatments, anybody can do them.” Of the treatments complained about, 86% were carried out by beauticians, hairdressers or laypeople, with 81% of complainants finding their practitioner on social media. Clients were often unaware of the risks, said Collins: 93% were not warned about serious complications and thought the treatments were low-risk beauty treatments; 83% did not give informed consent'; and 84% were ignored or blocked by their practitioner when they tried to seek help.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Botched cosmetic procedures on the rise, says campaign group",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/01/botched-cosmetic-procedures-on-the-rise-says-campaign-group
3/2/2022,"The UK has announced its first wave of sanctions against senior military figures in Belarus specifically for their role in joining and facilitating the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Belarusian chief of the general staff, Maj Gen Victor Gulevich, and three other deputy defence ministers will all face sanctions, along with two military enterprises. The EU – with which the UK has been working in close cooperation over sanctions – is likely to take similar measures. Belarus has been used as a base for Russian soldiers to pour into Ukraine. Soldiers from the Belarus army have joined the invasion. The Foreign Office described Gulevich as responsible for directing the actions of the Belarusian armed forces, which have supported and enabled the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “He has directed joint military exercises with Russia, and consented to the deployment of Russian troops along the border of Belarus with Ukraine, which has directly contributed to Russia’s ability to attack Ukraine, including from positions in Belarus,” the Foreign Office said. The two state enterprises being sanctioned by the UK are JSC 558 Aircraft Repair Plant and JSC Integral, a military semiconductor manufacturer. JSC 558 provides maintenance and servicing to military aircraft at Baranovichi airbase, from which Russian aircraft operated as part of the invasion. The UK has already sanctioned more than 100 Belarus government members for throwing thousands of citizens into jail for protesting stolen elections in August 2020, and there are now signs that the US is willing to use the power of the dollar to start crashing the Belarus economy in the way that has been attempted with the Russian economy. The US Treasury this week designated two large state-owned banks in Belarus, Belinvestbank and Dabrabyt, as subject to sanctions. It has already imposed five waves of sanctions on Belarus and claims to have sanctioned 24 Belarusian individuals and entities specifically in response to Belarus’s support for and facilitation of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Liz Truss, the British foreign secretary, also acted on Tuesday to use newly passed laws immediately to target Russia’s biggest bank, Sberbank, in effect cutting the bank out of the UK’s financial markets. Measures are also being enacted in close alignment with the US, EU and other partners which will collectively cut off much of Russia’s hi-tech imports, constraining Russia’s military-industrial and technological capabilities for years to come. Truss claimed: “We are inflicting economic pain on Putin and those closest to him. We will not rest until Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity is restored. The [Alexander] Lukashenko regime actively aids and abets Russia’s illegal invasion and will be made to feel the economic consequences for its support for Putin. “There will be nowhere to hide. Nothing – and no one – is off the table.”",News/World news,UK announces first wave of sanctions against Belarus,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/uk-announces-first-wave-of-sanctions-against-belarus
3/2/2022,"On the oncology ward at Chernihiv children’s hospital, patients are battling cancer, their city is surrounded by Russian forces, and now they are running out of painkillers and stockpiling food. “We don’t know how much time we have,” said Serhiy Zosimenko, a charity worker supporting the 11 patients, their doctors and parents. “We actually don’t know how to survive here, It’s unreal. We don’t have any more resources.” Hospitals in Poland and Slovakia have agreed to continue treatment, waiving any fees, but for now the children – aged between two and 15 – can’t get there, because the city is effectively under siege. The only way out would be on a helicopter. “The problem is we can’t evacuate the kids from the ground, we can only evacuate them by air,” Zosimenko said. “All routes to our city are mined.” Chernihiv sits about 90 miles north-east of Kyiv, on a road to the Belarusian border. It was surrounded by Russian forces days ago, who have shelled civilian areas, including homes, a kindergarten and a market. All roads in and out have been laid with explosives to defend the city, the head of the regional administration Viacheslav Chaus said in a post on Facebook. One Russian rocket landed just short of the cancer patients. “Two days ago a shell hit 200 metres from our hospital – it was a grad rocket,” Zosimenko said. He spent the day gathering building supplies to improve the basement bomb shelter, medicines from pharmacies and food. Community spirit is keeping them going, with pharmacies and other shops donating to meet the hospital needs for free. But some things are already in short supply, particularly painkillers. “When people are sick with cancer they need a lot of painkiller drugs, and we have a problem with morphine and other drugs,” Zosimenko said. “For example the oncology hospital in Chernikiv, they have only eight ampules of morphine or other painkillers.” The hospital wasn’t properly prepared for war, with a shelter in such terrible condition that people were getting sick from sleeping there, and haunted by the prospect of Covid adding to their troubles. So they slept on the first floor and run down each time there is an air raid. “Everyone is tired, especially the medical staff, they don’t sleep normally for the last week, just two or three hours,” Zosimenko said. There is extra strain on doctors and nurses because some staff are staying at home with their families, which the others understand. For those who stayed, and for the patients, they are trying to improve conditions in the basement, plastering the walls, putting in a proper floor, lighting and some beds. He has been moved by the incredible community spirit at a time of intense pressure; every time he goes to get supplies, from building material yards and pharmacies or supermarkets, everything has been free. “Just take care of those kids,” the business owners say. “I understand that I live in the most wonderful country in the world – 40 million people who care about the people they don’t know,” he said. “If Russia can get control of our country, it will only be in one way, that they decide to kill 40 million people, because this country has 40 million people ready to protect it.” He works for a charity, Evum, that supports the paediatric oncology department. Before the war that involved “white collar” work sourcing supplies. Now he is scouring the shops for food and begging for international help to get the children out of the war zone, and preparing – if necessary – to fight. He’s brought his own rifle to the hospital, and together with some of the children’s fathers, created an informal protection unit. “We are here with our own weapons, some of the fathers of these kids bring something so they can protect them too,” he said. “We are ready to give our own lives but not willing to give the lives of these children.” “I work with kids, because they are architects, only people who can build the future. We can just help them survive, so they can do what they should do.” He has no regrets, despite the turmoil of the last week, and a growing conviction that many of those bracing to defend their city may not live to see Russia defeated. “Every time when I came here to this cabinet and see the rifle, it reminds me of what happened here for the last six days, feel some stress inside me. I remember again that someone started war in my country,” he said. “If I don’t die here in the next two weeks, it’s going to be a miracle.”",News/World news,‘We don’t know how to survive here’: a cancer ward for Ukrainian children under siege ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/cancer-ward-chernihiv-hospital-ukrainian-children-under-siege
3/2/2022,"Good morning. Sydney residents are on alert with the “rain bomb” that soaked Brisbane and triggered record floods in northern NSW expected to bring a “life-threatening” amount of rain today. The Bureau of Meteorology warns a severe thunderstorm and gusty winds could develop by this evening across the city, south coast and southern tablelands. As the storms head south, the national flood death toll stands at 10 after the bodies of two people were discovered yesterday – a 76-year-old man at Glen Esk, Queensland and an 80-year-old woman in Lismore, NSW. Among the death and damage, stories of hope and community strength are being shared online as local people offer shelter, share supplies and search for stranded residents. The north coast town of Ballina is facing a one-in-500-years flood as the flood peak was expected to coincide with high-tide overnight. As NSW prepares for damaging weather, the clean-up effort has begun in Queensland – where an estimated 15,000 properties were damaged – and in Lismore, which suffered through the worst floods on record. And the national disaster recovery and resilience agency has defended its decision to omit Lismore from its priority areas for flood mitigation funding just three months ago despite it being one of the most flood-prone areas in Australia. Russia is targeting civilians with missile strikes in an attempt to demoralise the population, the government in Kyiv said on Tuesday. Two Russian missiles struck the TV tower in the Ukrainian capital, knocking out some access to news and broadcasts and reportedly killing five and wounding another five. A huge armoured column is rolling towards Kyiv, raising fears Russia may pulverise civilian areas in its attempt to seize Ukraine’s capital after missiles killed at least 18 civilians in the country’s largest second city. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has appealed to the EU to “prove that you are with us” and help “light win over darkness” in a passionate address to the European parliament after Ukraine’s membership application. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has tested positive to Covid-19 but says he will continue all his responsibilities. Morrison said he was isolating at home in Sydney and “continuing to follow health guidelines”. “While in isolation I will continue to discharge all my responsibilities as prime minister … focusing on our emergency response to the devastating floods in Queensland and New South Wales, and ensuring we stand with each and every one of the affected communities both now and as the waters eventually recede,” he said. Labor has questioned whether Peter Dutton’s GoFundMe for flood-affected communities has breached Queensland fundraising laws, where individuals are required to seek state government approval for one-off fundraising appeals. The Labor frontbencher, Andrew Leigh, raised questions and highlighted the need to reform Australia’s “outdated” fundraising laws. The United Australia Party is facing questions over a Senate candidate, Sean Ambrose, who appeared to defend Putin in a tweet on Saturday. The allegations come just days after the United Australia party disendorsed a candidate in Melbourne for his pro-Putin views. The ABC has awarded its former head of news, Gaven Morris, a contract to advise on the relocation of some staff to Parramatta in Sydney’s west, just weeks after he left the national broadcaster. The NSW Liberal state executive is trying to negotiate a plan for branch preselections before Friday to avoid federal intervention. Some members have proposed so-called fast-tracked plebiscites in all remaining seats where there is a challenger, including those of ministers Sussan Ley and Alex Hawke. A US bill to enshrine the right to abortion in federal law was blocked by Senate Republicans on Monday. Democrats knew it would not pass but wanted the votes recorded nonetheless. The Queen has recovered from Covid nine days after she caught the virus, and will host two virtual audiences with foreign ambassadors on Tuesday. Wildfires in drought-stricken Argentina have sent a giant ash cloud across southern Paraguay. Residents have been warned to stay inside to avoid breathing in the smoky miasma.

Elly Varrenti knew about empty nest syndrome, but her’s child’s departure after a week after getting his year 12 results in 2020 hit her for six. “We used to talk, my son and I. I’d tell him stories at night well into his teens. We’d go for walks and he’d disclose all sorts of things. Sometimes he’d even hold my hand. Today I watch him lurch from day to day, from child to adult. And I watch him fall over. Once very badly. He nearly died. I nearly died watching him nearly die.” It’s the start of the month, which means we have the latest drop of must-reads from Guardian editors who share the new local books they’ve already read and loved – or can’t wait to get their hands on.

3/2/2022,"“I’m bursting with pride,” says Sharon Wuyts, 45, on the day her home town, Southend-on-Sea, was granted city status. The carer “snuck out of work” to attend celebrations with her colleague Debra Goaté on the seafront. The pair ended up staying more than four hours in drizzle to wait for Prince Charles and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, to mark the occasion by greeting the crowd. “We wanted to show our support in the blistering cold,” says Wuyts. She explains why: “The first things I associate with Southend are: the pier, doughnuts and entertainment. I used to visit here as a child, my mum took me on the train from Chelmsford. It’s part of my childhood. Now I will be able to tell my grandchildren, when they arrive, that I was here when Southend got its city status.” Goaté says: “Lots of places have become cities, so why not Southend?” And she reckons it was worth waiting for the royals in the cold. “Camila was so nice. She said: ‘Sorry we couldn’t bring nice weather with us.’ She shook my hand – I could chop it off and auction it for charity.” Southend was given city status after the murder of its MP, David Amess, last October. It was an issue he had campaigned on for years – he ended what turned out to be his last speech in the Commons with the words: “And of course, we must make Southend a city.” On Tuesday, Amess posthumously became the first freeman of the city of Southend at a ceremony in the civic centre attended by his widow and children and the royal couple. And Southend now has new roads signs which read: “Welcome to the City of Southend-on-Sea, home of the world’s longest pleasure pier. Twinned with Sopot, Poland.” Sadly, no one from the Polish resort city on the Baltic Sea was invited to the party. But when the royal couple turned up at Southend’s famously long pier, they were entertained with a rendition of the The Lion Sleeps Tonight, played by a steel band from the South Essex African Caribbean Association. One of its trustees, Shauna Creary, 63, describes Southend’s new status as “brilliant and much needed”. She hopes it will help to highlight Southend’s diversity. “When you hear about seaside towns, there’s a kind of label to it,” she says. “It’s not that interesting or it’s just candy floss and amusements. It ignores the people that live in the area that make the place – the community itself. I hope being a city changes how people think about Southend.” Creary describes city status as Amess’s legacy but she wonders if it would ever have happened if he had not been killed in such brutal circumstance. Sheila Wright, 60, was waiting to get her council tenancy arrangements changed at the civic centre as the city ceremony got under way. She says Southend was destined to become to a city “eventually, not this quickly”. She adds: “I think it’s a wonderful thing, especially for David Amess and his family. Our high street is so empty, hopefully it will bring new businesses to the town.” Taylor Randall, 20, who works in a cafe on the seafront, is not so sure. “I don’t understand what difference it makes,” he says. “It’s just a title. We need more than a title to bring pride back.” The new city has some of the most deprived areas in Essex with 40% of its neighbourhoods falling in the bottom third of the deprivation index. And some have sneered at granting the title of city to a struggling place at the end of what commuters dub the “misery line”. But Sheila Smerdon, 59, who was out walking her bulldog Nellie on the seafront, reckons Southend deserves a better reputation. Smerdon, who has lived in Southend all her life, says: “It’s got good parts and bad parts, like most towns, or cities I should now say. And this should bring a bit of energy.” Charmaine Bailey, 49, who runs a neighbouring ice-cream parlour with her husband, Jason, agrees. She says: “It’s a lovely place, it just needs something put back in the centre – that’s a little bit doom and gloom. But it definitely deserves to be a city.” Jimmy Constantinou, 77, who runs a neighbouring cafe, will not have a word said against Southend. “The people here are very excited and very grateful. I absolutely love Southend,” he says. A former headteacher, James Lupton, 43, dressed up as a soldier on a horse to celebrate. “I’m born-and-bred Southend. Anything that raises the profile of our town, now city, is excellent. I just wish it had happened without the sad circumstances around it.”",News/UK news,‘I will tell my grandchildren’: Southend celebrates city status,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/01/i-will-tell-my-grandchildren-southend-celebrates-city-status
3/2/2022,"It had only been intended as a glorified photo opportunity. A chance for Boris Johnson to look statesmanlike back home as he went on a day trip to Poland and Estonia. A quick in-out tour of eastern Europe where he got to rub shoulders with two prime ministers on the frontline and the secretary general of Nato. Nothing too tricky, nothing too newsy. Nothing that couldn’t just as easily have been done in a two-minute phone call. Diplomacy 101. Just a bog-standard show of solidarity as Ukraine endured its sixth day of Russian invasion. And that’s the way it had looked to be panning out. The Suspect had arrived in Warsaw in the morning for talks with Mateusz Morawiecki, the Polish prime minister, in which the two men had done little more than reiterate their support of Ukraine and their condemnation of Russia. And the same had gone for Johnson’s mini speech in which he basically reiterated the same points. After all, what more could usefully be said without a huge strategic rethink from Nato countries? Boris may like to think of himself as a disruptor who makes things up as he goes along, but this is one crisis he has played strictly by the book. Then the choreography went awry. After Johnson had announced the UK would be taking at least twice as many refugees as the government had first promised – a move that was inevitable given the cross-party expressions of horror at the lack of compassion – came the press conference. And step forward Ukrainian journalist Daria Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Centre, whose two and a half minute intervention was less a question and more a howl of pain. People were dying, friends were terrified, she said. The reason Johnson was in Warsaw was because it was safe. There was no way he or any of his family would set foot in Kyiv but the people of Ukraine had no choice. They had been left to fight the Russians single-handedly while western leaders did little more than offer expressions of solidarity. As for sanctions, were they really working? Were any oligarchs or their children feeling the squeeze? So could Nato put its mind to protecting Ukrainian airspace with a no-fly zone? By the end, Kaleniuk was in tears. As were others in the room. It had been a moving and powerful reminder of the suffering taking place on our doorstep. Johnson was visibly disturbed by Kaleniuk. He squirmed and on occasions tried to avoid catching her eye. He did however make no effort to interrupt her or cut her short and – maybe it was the rawness of her pain that got to him – for once in his life gave her a straight answer. Normally the last thing he would ever think of doing. Much as he might have liked to have promised her more, he stuck to the script. The UK and the west could do little more than they were already doing without risking an all-out war with Russia. And that was something Nato just could not contemplate. If the price of that decision was Ukraine’s destruction, then so be it. Though he hoped it would not come to that. There is a crack in everything. That’s how the light gets in. And in that exchange the limitations of the Nato response had been laid bare. Boris might have been enjoying the opportunity to do his Churchill tribute act on a world stage – at the very least it was a distraction from his troubles at home – but for all his muscular rhetoric, the expressions of solidarity and calling out of Putin’s war crimes, he was essentially operating with two arms tied behind his back. By the time that sanctions really hit, Kyiv could be rubble. The bottom line was that, stripped of his front and grandiosity, The Suspect is as much an onlooker to The Horror as the rest of us. If that was an all too brief moment of epiphany for Johnson – his denial and self-regard soon kicked back in – then Priti Patel would later have hers in the Commons. At least, she would have done if she wasn’t too dim to realise that she had been hopelessly exposed as a dangerously out of touch and inadequate home secretary. Because on Monday Priti Vacant had announced her new visa requirements for Ukrainian refugees and less than 24 hours later she was having to admit she had misjudged the mood of the country – it’s a problem when you’re naturally far more vicious than everyone else – and was now proposing a completely different, more open set of rules. Though this wasn’t quite how she put it. For Vacant, yesterday had been Phase 1 and today was Phase 2. It’s quite possible we’ll get Phase 3 tomorrow, when she remembers that most people also count their cousins as family. Though it’s equally possible that Patel would pride herself on keeping as many of her own family as possible out of the country. Especially if they were fleeing a war zone. “The Ukraine”, as she again insisted on calling it. So it was government policy to make itself look incompetent and out of touch by introducing a Phase 1 that even its own MPs couldn’t stomach. Understandably, Yvette Cooper, Labour’s shadow home secretary, was a little confused by the change of heart and tried to work out just who could and couldn’t come to the UK. It was way beyond Vacant’s intellectual pay grade to come up with any answers so she did what she always does when she feels challenged. She got stroppy and picked fights with whoever she could. She had a go at Cooper for not being supportive enough and then at the SNP for being a security risk who couldn’t be trusted with sensitive information. This from a minister who was sacked for moonlighting with her own foreign policy agenda. “The British government is the first government to outline practical measures for bringing Ukrainian refugees to the UK,” she said. To everyone’s surprise. It would be a turn up if the Poles had determined UK refugee policy. Though they couldn’t do any worse. It turned out that what Vacant had meant to say was that the UK had been the first to come up with a refugee policy. Which was just delusional. While opposition MPs tried to pin down the details, most Tories were just relieved their government had finally done more for refugees. Though not Edward Leigh. He wondered if we had done far too much already and thought his constituents had had enough of Ukraine. So sweet. Patel breathed a sigh of recognition. At last.

3/2/2022,"China has signalled its willingness to play a mediator role in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine as the war entered its sixth day. In his first phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, since the outbreak of the war, China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, said on Tuesday that Beijing “laments” the outbreak of the conflict and is “extremely concerned” with the harm to civilians, according to a Chinese readout. State-owned China Central Television said Kuleba asked China to use its influence to help mediate in its conflict with Russia. It added that Kuleba “asked for help in finding a diplomatic solution”. The Chinese foreign ministry said the call was initiated by the Ukrainian side. The two foreign ministers also discussed evacuation of Chinese nationals from Ukraine, in which there were 6,000 Chinese citizens living, working and studying there, according to official figures. “Ukraine is willing to strengthen communications with China, and it looks forward to China playing a mediation role in achieving a ceasefire,” according to a Chinese readout, which cited Kuleba. Wang’s call with Kuleba came amid escalation of the conflict. On Tuesday, Russian forces bombarded the regional government building in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city, killing at least 10 civilians, according to official accounts. Meanwhile, a huge armoured column rolled towards the capital, Kyiv, raising fears Russia may resort to pulverising civilian areas. Kuleba tweeted a video of the huge explosion in Kharkiv’s Freedom Square, calling it a “barbaric missile strike” resulting from Vladimir Putin’s inability to “break Ukraine down”. Western allies continue to show solidarity with Ukraine, piling pressure on Russia through sanctions and military assistance. China, however, said it “fiercely” opposes sanctions against Russia. It said dialogue “is the only way to stop the fighting”. China has been watching the events closely. On Tuesday, Wang continued to take a balanced view on Russia’s action against its neighbour. He said while China believed the security of one country “should not come at the expense of the security of other countries”, regional security “cannot be realised through the expansion of military blocs”. Wang told Kuleba the pressing task for now was “to ease the situation as much as possible to prevent the conflict from escalating or even getting out of control”. He also urged Ukraine to “assume corresponding international responsibilities”. “China is trying to juggle a balanced position to support Russia’s ‘reasonable concerns’ and at the same time not to burn all the bridges,” said Yun Sun, the director of the east Asia programme at the Stimson Centre in Washington. “[Beijing] will not give the world the satisfaction of opposing Russia. Putin knew it. Whatever Russia does, the US still looms large as the biggest threat to China. For that alone, China will not oppose Russia.”",News/World news,China signals willingness to mediate in Ukraine-Russia war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/china-mediate-ukraine-russia-war
3/2/2022,"The University of Bristol failed to make “reasonable” allowances for a student with severe social anxiety and fear of public presentations that contributed to her depression and subsequent suicide, a county court has been told. The allegation came on the first day of a case against the university brought by the parents of Natasha Abrahart, a 20-year-old physics undergraduate who was found dead at her flat in 2018, a day before she was to take part in a presentation to staff and students. Robert and Margaret Abrahart are suing Bristol under the Equalities Act for not taking reasonable care of their daughter’s “wellbeing, health and safety”, arguing that the university did not do enough to help despite staff knowing that Abrahart suffered from mental disabilities and was struggling with her studies. The parents say their daughter was a victim of discrimination as a disabled student. The court heard that Abrahart experienced great difficulty in meeting new or unfamiliar people, with a friend, Rajan Palan, recounting that her feelings of loneliness at Bristol were “exacerbated” by her shyness making her unable to talk to people outside of a close circle. On the first day of the hearing, attention was focused on the assessments used in Abrahart’s physics course, including a laboratory conference where Abrahart was expected to take part in presentations to about 50 people in a large lecture theatre. Jamie Burton QC, for the claimants, said there were “several reasonable adjustments” that the university could have allowed Abrahart, including replacing oral assessment with written assessment or examination of Abrahart’s laboratory notebooks, or providing her with written questions in advance. For the conference, Burton told the court that the university could have held it without other students present, or moved it to a smaller venue than the 329-seat lecture hall used. Burton noted that Abrahart’s parents were not alleging that members of staff breached their duty of care to their daughter, and recognised that many had tried to help her. In its formal response, the university said that both academic and non-academic staff tried to engage with Abrahart over alternative assessments. But it also argued that it was not reasonable to remove the use of oral assessments because it would have “compromised” Abrahart’s education. Burton told the court that there was a significant deterioration in Abrahart’s mental health in the months before her death, with Abrahart carrying out internet searches on subjects including “Why do I hate people?” and “Why do I find people scary?”. Margaret Abrahart, under examination, said her daughter had not told her of her fears over the assessments or presentations. “I knew something was upsetting her hugely,” she said. “If I questioned her I knew it was going to be very stressful.” An inquest in 2019 ruled that Abrahart killed herself partly as a result of a “gross failure” to provide care by Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership Trust, which “significantly underestimated” her condition. Abrahart was one of 11 University of Bristol students to kill themselves between 2016 and 2018. The hearing at the Bristol civil justice centre continues for another six days, with a judgment reserved for a later date.

3/2/2022,"Waging war by economic means is nothing new. Napoleon imposed an ineffective embargo on British exports in the early 19th century and during the first world war there were attempts by both sides to starve each other into submission. But since 1945 sanctions have been used with increasing frequency as a means of trying to change either the policy stance or the regimes in targeted countries. One study by a group of German academics notes there have been more than 1,400 cases of nations being threatened with, or hit by, sanctions since the second world war. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the report by the Ifo thinktank found that the sanctions were more likely to be successful the harder the targeted economy was hit. On average, living standards fall by 4% in the first two years of the restrictive measures being implemented, but that masks a wide range of different outcomes. Adam Slater, economist at the Oxford Economics consultancy says the sanctions imposed on Russia between 2014 and 2018 cut GDP by around 1.2% but thinks a “larger impact looks likely this time” as a result of a toughening up of the west’s approach. “We think a 4-6% of GDP hit relative to a pre-crisis baseline is a plausible downside scenario.” But hitting a country economically is a different matter from forcing it into a policy U-turn or bringing about a change of government. Jeremy Greenstock, once the UK’s ambassador to the UN, says “there is nothing else between words and military action if you want pressure to bear on a government.” But in the high-profile cases there is only limited evidence to show they have worked. Take the case of Cuba, which has been under US sanctions since the late 1950s. Washington strongly opposed the takeover of power by Fidel Castro’s communist regime and ever since has restricted the flow of goods to the island. The UN and the Cuban government estimate the total cost to the economy has been $130bn (£97bn) over six decades but as the Harvard academic Christopher Rhodes notes all the sanctions have done is to provide the regime with a convenient scapegoat for the country’s woes. If anything, the impact of wide-ranging sanctions against Venezuela have been even more damaging than in Cuba. The economy grew for the first time in seven years in 2021 following a period that saw output fall by 75% and the currency collapse. There was intense economic suffering and mass migration, but again no regime change. Iran has faced US sanctions for more than 40 years, ever since the seizure of the American embassy in Tehran by radical students in 1979. More recently, there have been UN-backed steps to prevent banned nuclear activities, with a marked tightening of the sanctions regime announced by Donald Trump in 2018. A brief easing of the sanctions led to a spurt in the economy in 2016 but the growth record has been dismal since. Even so, Iran shows no immediate sign of buckling, insisting the sanctions be dropped before talks on its nuclear programme start. North Korea is one of the world’s poorest countries, with income per head less than one-tenth of neighbouring South Korea. The UN has passed resolution after resolution demanding North Korea halt its nuclear weapon programme, punishing sanctions have been imposed restricting trade and targeting individuals linked to the military. There has not been the slightest sign of North Korea demilitarising. Nor, despite causing intense economic and humanitarian distress has the weapon being deployed against Russia – seizing the country’s reserves held overseas – so far worked in Afghanistan. Lord Meghnad Desai, says: “American hegemony of financial machinery is total. The US controls the International Monetary Fund. It can seize the foreign exchange reserves of Afghanistan and cause a famine to punish the Taliban for having humiliated the US. Will it now succeed in strangling Putin?” South Africa is an example of where sanctions were more effective and provides some hope for those who think the west can win its battle against Putin by non-military means. Nelson Mandela said there was “no doubt” trade embargoes of the 1980s hastened the demise of apartheid. Two things differentiated South Africa from Cuba, Iran, Venezuela and North Korea. Firstly, by the late 1980s the apartheid regime was internationally friendless, with even countries such as the UK and the US passing laws restricting trade. Secondly, its economic isolation was reinforced by a sporting and cultural boycott that made it clear to South Africans they were living in a pariah state. “Even harsh sanctions may fail to impress Putin. Iran and North Korea have shown that brutal dictatorships can persevere for a long time despite very heavy sanctions”, says Holger Schmieding of Berenberg bank. “But many Russians have close links to the free world and strong family ties to Ukraine. The news about the reason for the sanctions, Putin’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, will likely spread even in Russia, especially as its military seems to incur significant casualties that will be difficult to hide.” In the past, Russia has helped soften the sanctions imposed on other countries. Whether Putin can withstand the economic measures now being aimed at him will depend on how many reliable friends he can still muster and – just as importantly – whether the elite stays loyal.

3/2/2022,"Sergiy Stakhovsky says he will use a gun if necessary after the tennis player joined Ukraine’s reserve army following Russia’s invasion of the country last week. “I know how to use the gun,” he said in an interview with BBC Today. “I pretty much hope that I will not have to use the gun, but if I have to, I’ll have to.” Stakhovsky, who defeated Roger Federer at Wimbledon in 2013, said his wife did not speak to him for a day after he explained he would be joining the army reserves and his children think he is away at another tennis tournament. “I know that it is extremely hard on my wife. My kids don’t know that I’m here. They don’t understand war. They’re too little to understand what’s going on,” said Stakhovsky, who retired from professional tennis after the Australian Open in January. On Tuesday the WTA, ATP, ITF and the grand slam tournaments ruled that Russian and Belarusian players will be allowed to compete at the grand slam tournaments and both tours but they will not play under their national flags. The ITF board has suspended indefinitely the Russian Tennis Federation and the Belarus Tennis Federation from ITF membership and team competitions. Their players will be unable to compete in the Davis and Billie Jean King Cups, plus team competitions in the wheelchair, seniors, junior and beach tennis divisions. “A deep sense of distress, shock and sadness has been felt across the entire tennis community following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the past week,” the governing bodies said in a joint statement. “Our thoughts are with the people of Ukraine, and we commend the many tennis players who have spoken out and taken action against this unacceptable act of aggression. We echo their calls for the violence to end and peace to return.” The ruling comes after Elina Svitolina, the highest-ranked Ukrainian player, said she would not play any match against a Russian or Belarusian opponent unless the WTA ruled they would only be allowed to compete as neutral athletes. In recent days, numerous Russian players have posted anti-war messages. Andrey Rublev went viral on social media after writing “no war please” on a camera after a match. Daniil Medvedev, who rose to No 1 in the men’s rankings this week, also called for peace. The most forceful statement was provided by Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, the top-ranked woman in Russia, who wrote: “Personal ambitions or political motives cannot justify violence.”",Sport/Sport,Ukraine’s Sergiy Stakhovsky ‘will use gun if I have to’ after joining army,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/01/ukraine-tennis-sergiy-stakhovsky-will-use-gun-if-i-have-to-after-joining-army
3/2/2022,"An MP has claimed that the Russian oligarch and Chelsea football club owner, Roman Abramovich, is hastily selling UK properties to avoid potential financial sanctions. Chris Bryant, the Labour MP and head of the parliamentary standards committee, said the government was moving too slowly on imposing sanctions on those with alleged links to Vladimir Putin following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He told the Commons on Tuesday: “I think he [Abramovich] is terrified of being sanctioned, which is why he’s already going to sell his home tomorrow, and sell another flat as well. My anxiety is that we’re taking too long about these things.” Announcing a package of measures in the wake of the conflict, the Foreign Office said “120 businesses and oligarchs” would be hit by swingeing new financial restrictions. Only a handful of individuals have so far been targeted, however. Bryant used parliamentary privilege, which protects MPs from legal proceedings, to suggest that Abramovich was taking steps to avoid his assets being frozen. The 55-year-old is among Russia’s – and Britain’s – richest people and is believed to be close to Putin. Over the weekend, the oligarch announced he would hand over the “stewardship and care” of Chelsea football club to the trustees of its charitable foundation, though the legal implications of that move remain unclear. On Monday, his spokesperson said he was “trying to help” in the Russia-Ukraine conflict after being “contacted by the Ukrainian side for support in achieving a peaceful resolution”. The following day a number of reporters arrived outside Abramovich’s 15-bedroom mansion on Kensington Palace Gardens in west London following rumours that a potential buyer was due for a lunchtime tour of the property, which was bought for £90m in 2009. There were no obvious signs that such a tour took place. A black cab pulled up outside at about 12pm and drove off again five minutes later without anyone exiting. There was plenty of activity at the house, with a workman saying decorators were “repainting all of the walls on the downstairs”. The Russian embassy at the top of the street – nicknamed “Billionaires’ Row” as it is home to the most expensive houses in the UK – has been defaced with graffiti reading “stop killing our future”. A crowd of about 30 protesters were seen waving Ukraine flags outside. Abramovich’s spokesperson was approached for comment on the claim he seeking to sell some of his properties. Boris Johnson was forced to correct the parliamentary record last week after wrongly telling MPs that Abramovich was already subject to sanctions. In a written statement and a rare admission of an error by the prime minister, the government said: “Roman Abramovich has not been the subject of targeted measures.” Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, Bryant said: “I fear that the government is frightened of lawyers’ letters from all these oligarchs’ friends.” The MP, who also chairs the all-party parliamentary group on Russia, has long called for tougher action against wealthy Russians accused of having close links to Putin’s regime. He has rejected reports that Abramovich was involved in brokering peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, calling them “completely untrue” on Twitter. That was disputed by Abramovich’s spokesperson, who pointed to reports saying that the Russian had been asked for help by the Ukrainian side. Abramovich has maintained that he is a non-political person and is not linked to Putin or the Russian state. It is unclear what his role is in peace talks or on whose behalf he is working. A source close to him stressed that the Chelsea owner had been asked to help because he is a respected figure in Russia and within the business community. Earlier, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, told the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva that “nothing and no one is off the table”, when it came to sanctions against Russia. “We’re going after the highest echelons of the Russian elite, targeting President Putin personally and all of those complicit in his aggression,” she said.",News/World news,"Roman Abramovich hastily selling UK properties, MP claims",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/roman-abramovich-hastily-selling-uk-properties-mp-claims
3/2/2022,"The “rain bomb” that soaked Brisbane and triggered record floods in northern New South Wales will develop into an east coast low and dump as much as 150mm of rain on Sydney with “life-threatening” risks on Wednesday. The Bureau of Meteorology has pared back its earlier forecast for the daily rain total from as much as 150mm to 200mm to 100mm to 150mm, but reissued its severe weather warning for damaging winds and torrential rainfall for a coastal region stretching from near Newcastle down to almost the Victorian border. “Heavy rainfall which may lead to flash flooding is forecast to develop over parts of the Hunter and Metropolitan, Illawarra, South Coast and parts of Central Tablelands and Southern Tablelands Forecast Districts during Wednesday,” the bureau said. “Six-hourly rainfall totals between 80 and 120mm are likely.” “Locally intense rainfall leading to dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding is possible with thunderstorms with six-hourly rainfall totals up to 200mm [are] possible,” the warning said, adding that wind gusts could surpass 90km/h along the coastal fringe. Looks like a wet day ahead for Sydney although the forecast has been pared back from its earlier totals of as much as 200mm. Still, east coast lows often bring thunderstorms that can fill the rain gauges in a hurry. @BOM_au pic.twitter.com/M0Z0T0MLKJ East coast lows are intense weather systems that can include thunderstorms and generate dangerous surf. Weather models can struggle to pick how close the low will form near or on the coast and how long they will linger, leading to forecast changes. The rain will extend the damage already inflicted on communities in Queensland and northern NSW, stretching emergency services and leaving a huge toll in lives lost and damage. Sydney’s rainfall prediction for Thursday was increased by the bureau to 50mm to 70mm, up from 30mm to 50mm forecast previously, indicating the low may take longer to move off into the Tasman Sea than earlier expected. The State Emergency Service issued its own warning for the possibility of major flooding for rivers in an area of the state taking in greater Sydney, the south coast and Queanbeyan, near Canberra. Thursday is also looking pretty dam for much of the NSW coast and the hinterland. @BOM_au pic.twitter.com/iwz0L6kGTU The bureau said minor flooding was already occurring on several rivers near Sydney, including the Hawkesbury-Nepean near Richmond. “The Hawkesbury River at North Richmond may exceed the minor flood level (3.80m) early Wednesday morning. Further rises to the moderate flood level (7.9m) are possible Wednesday afternoon. “The Hawkesbury River at Windsor is likely to reach the minor flood level (5.80m) Wednesday afternoon. Further rises to the moderate flood level (7.0m) are possible Wednesday night.” Earlier this week WaterNSW said Sydney’s main reservoir, Warragamba Dam, would probably start to spill into the Hawkesbury-Nepean floodplain by Wednesday morning. The dam, which holds 80% of Sydney’s drinking water, started releasing water to give it some moderate “airspace” before the downpour. Even so, it had reached 99% capacity by Tuesday. “The upper range of the predicted spill peak from Warragamba dam has increased overnight, though it remains at a rate still well below the spill experienced in March 2021,” WaterNSW said on Tuesday. Several other dams were spilling or considered likely to as a result of the rain, WaterNSW said. “Tallowa and Cordeaux Dams are already spilling and other Upper Nepean storages likely to spill in the days ahead include Nepean, Avon, and Cataract, along with Woronora Dam to Sydney’s south.” Looking ahead, eight-day totals indicate some large rainfall totals are possible for parts of NSW. With dams full and catchments saturated, flooding is going to be a risk for a while yet. (Tropical Cyclone #Anika doing its thing in WA too as it restrengthens to a Cat 2.) @BOM_au pic.twitter.com/Gx3enOkuGX Dean Narramore, a senior bureau meteorologist, said on Tuesday the east coast low was likely to be more compact compared with similar recent systems such as in June 2016 or that which triggered floods near Sydney in March 2021. The event’s intensity depends on how close the low forms and how long it lingers near the coast. “The worst of the weather, the strongest winds, the heaviest rainfall and the worst of the beach erosion will occur near and just south of where that [system] crosses the coast, if it does, or when it comes close to the coast,” Narramore told a media conference in Sydney. With sodden ground, strong winds could bring down trees, adding to the risks and also disrupting power supplies.

3/2/2022,"Russian state television talkshows are describing videos of missiles striking Ukrainian cities and reports of Russian soldiers killed in action as “fakes”, as the country’s media try to account for photos and video emerging from Ukraine that contradict official reports of the invasion. The “mythbusting” is one of the adjustments that TV propaganda shows have had to make as evidence of the growing destruction in cities such as Kharkiv and Kyiv makes it increasingly difficult for the government to present the fiction of a concentrated offensive in the Donbas region. On Channel One’s Vremya Pokazhet (Time Will Tell), pundits and officials took on the reports that hundreds of Russian soldiers had died, in a sign that the information about casualties could no longer be kept from the public. That followed stories over the weekend of Russian relatives describing shock and anger at finding out that their husbands, brothers and sons had been sent to fight in Ukraine. “There’s an enormous wave of information,” said the Russian MP Boris Chernyshev. “People are showing fakes, they’re showing what are allegedly our dead soldiers. All of that needs to be stopped.” For the first time on Tuesday, the Russian defence ministry said it planned to strike targets in Kyiv, days after its missiles rained down around the city as part of the beginning of the invasion. Soon, Russian missiles struck a TV tower in Kyiv, a sign that bombardments of Ukrainian cities are soon going to become far more widespread. Indiscriminate attacks are growing after early Russian failures to take the cities. Earlier on Tuesday a rocket aimed at the centre of Kharkiv killed at least seven people. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called it an act of terrorism. On TV debate shows, guests have begun to speak openly about the government’s desire to take Kyiv. “It’s just a question of time before they surrender or they are destroyed,” said Igor Korotchenko, a hawkish military journalist who featured prominently on one of the marathon sessions of 60 Minutes, a talkshow. “The fall of Kyiv is also a question of the coming three, four, five days, I don’t know exactly.” Russian news channels originally followed Vladimir Putin’s lead in calling the war a “special operation in the Donbas”, but on some state-run channels there have been references now to the beginning of a war. “It hasn’t changed that much but they’re having to admit now that it is a full-scale war and before it almost seemed like a surgical operation with no resistance,” said Francis Scarr, a journalist for BBC Monitoring who has closely followed how Russian state television has presented the war. The shows have come to dominate state television programming. “It’s very unusual. On Channel One they don’t have any entertainment shows throughout the whole day. Right from nine o’clock in the morning until 9pm, it’s just nonstop Vremya Pokazhet and Bolshaya Igra [The Great Game], you know, that one where they think they’re sort of dividing up the world.” Scarr said the shows had gone all-in on promoting “denazification”, a propaganda term that Putin has used to signify that Russian authorities plan to hold some kind of purge if they achieve their goals. It has also become a kind of informal slogan for the war. Alexander Kots, a pro-Kremlin journalist, used the term as he described Tuesday evening’s missile strike as part of the “denazification of Ukrainian television” on his Telegram channel. And a former diplomat who sent a Guardian journalist a long report on alleged Ukrainian war crimes as Russian forces bombed Kharkiv appeared to make reference to the term as justification for strikes against residential districts. “And what if Nazis have hidden in the population centres?” he wrote.",News/World news,Russian talkshows dismiss ‘fake’ reports of military losses ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/russian-talkshows-media-fake-reports-military-ukraine
