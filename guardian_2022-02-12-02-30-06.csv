2/12/2022,"When the singer Betty Davis marched on to the stage at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club in London in 1975, she was in her underwear – the sort that might have come from an S&M boutique elsewhere in Soho. At that time and in that place, she was enough to scare the living daylights out of her audience. And that was before the tall, slender woman with the giant afro started contorting her body as she delivered songs whose lyrics headed straight through the parental-guidance zone and out the other side, backed by stripped-down funk from her adept band. She was certainly ahead of her time. Later in the decade, the ripped fishnets of London’s punkettes and the gender-fluid styling of Prince would bring such gestures into the mainstream of pop. The uncompromising stance would take more time to filter through, resonating at deeper levels in the work of black female artists such as Erykah Badu, Macy Gray, Missy Elliott and Janelle Monáe, to whom she represented a pioneer and exemplar.  Davis, who has died aged 77, exerted an impact on popular culture out of all proportion to her short-lived celebrity, which rested chiefly on her brief marriage in 1968 to the trumpeter Miles Davis. Her cutting-edge tastes and freewheeling way of life changed the way Miles – already a star in the jazz world – thought, looked and sounded. That achievement would have been enough for most people, but half a century later her own music emerged from obscurity to intrigue new audiences. She was born in Durham, North Carolina, where her grandmother introduced her to the sound of the blues before the family moved to Homestead, a town outside Pittsburgh, where her father, Henry Mabry, found work in a steel mill. Betty (named after her mother) left home and high school for New York in 1960, aged 16, after winning a place at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan. “She knew she was going to be something, and we all knew it,” her brother Chuck told an interviewer. “We just didn’t know what.” Gravitating to Greenwich Village, she became immersed in a culture where styles and races mixed. Her looks brought her work as a model for fashion shoots in Ebony, Seventeen and Glamour magazines and for designers including Halston and Norma Kamali, but music was equally important to her. She DJed at a Village club and made a couple of singles without success before writing a song, Uptown (to Harlem), which appeared on a hit album by the Chambers Brothers in 1967. When she met Davis, introduced by Devon Wilson, Jimi Hendrix’s girlfriend, Mabry had just ended a relationship with the South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela. Davis had recently divorced his first wife, the dancer Frances Taylor. At the time he was trying to find a way out of the confines of a world where his adoring audiences expected him to wear narrow-cut Italian suits in fine fabrics while exploring the pensive cadences of My Funny Valentine in the way that had brought him fame and wealth. Under his new wife’s influence, Davis listened to Hendrix and Sly Stone. “Whatever I got into, he got into,” she said. He put her picture on the cover of an album, Filles de Kilimanjaro, which included a long track titled Mademoiselle Mabry, based on a lick from a Hendrix song, The Wind Cries Mary. His former wardrobe was replaced by buckskin-fringed jackets, silk scarves and freaky sunglasses. Over a band blending rock textures with bottom-heavy funk beats, he played trumpet through a wah-wah pedal. The marriage lasted barely a year, during which he tried and failed to get her a recording contract. It ended, in Betty’s account, when he turned violent after becoming convinced (wrongly, she maintained) that she was having an affair with Hendrix. In 1971 Betty Davis – as she would continue to be known – spent several months in London, where she was befriended by Marc Bolan and continued to write songs. Returning to the US, she made three albums – Betty Davis, They Say I’m Different and Nasty Gal – between 1973 and 1975, raising many eyebrows but little consumer interest, not least because much of the content was too sexually explicit for radio play. “I used to beat him with a turquoise chain,” she sang, provoking speculation over which of her partners she was depicting. Depressed by the death of her father towards the end of the 1970s, she returned to Homestead, where she lived quietly for the next four decades. In recent years, with her approval, her music has been reissued by the Seattle label Light in the Attic. A documentary, They Say I’m Different, was released in 2017, reawakening interest in the work of a woman so determinedly in control of her sound, her sexuality and her life choices.

2/12/2022,"The Honduran supreme court has ordered the release of six anti-mining protesters, ruling that they should never have been put on trial. The environmentalists, who have been held on remand for two and half years for trying to protect a river in a national park, faced up to 14 years in prison after being convicted on Wednesday of criminal damage and illegal detention. Two others were absolved of the same charges.  Wednesday’s verdict, which cemented Honduras’ ranking as the most dangerous country in the world for environmentalists and land rights defenders, was condemned as “appalling” by the UN special rapporteur for human rights defenders. Amnesty International described the verdict as “outrageous” and said the Guapinol activists were prisoners of conscience. But in a dramatic move, the supreme court accepted an appeal filed months earlier that challenged the constitutionality of the charges and the refusal to grant bail. The court found that the case should never have gone to trial because the judge who sanctioned the indictment against the defenders – and later ordered pre-trial detention – was not authorised to do so. The charges must be annulled and the men freed, as the judge violated due process by presiding on cases outside her jurisdiction. The eight men, from a poor, semi-rural community called Guapinol, have been held in an overcrowded prison throughout the pandemic as a result of bail being denied – yet the conditions requiring pre-trial detention were never met, according to Thursday’s supreme-court decision. “The rulings confirm that the case should never have proceeded and that the pre-trial detention was illegal,” said defence lawyer Edy Tabora. “The Guapinol defenders were arbitrarily detained.” The case stems from a huge open-pit mine in Tocoa, owned by one of the country’s most powerful couples, which was sanctioned inside a protected national park without community consultation in a process mired by irregularities, according to international experts. The Guapinol community set-up a peaceful protest camp after the mine polluted rivers relied upon by thousands of people. Security forces violently evicted the encampment and dozens of arrest warrants were issued against the protesters. International legal and human rights experts widely condemned the criminalization of the activists and the subsequent militarization of the community, which has forced several people to flee and seek asylum in the US. After a trial mired my delays, irregularities and accusations of judicial bias and falsified evidence, the criminal court ruled on Wednesday that José Márquez, Kelvin Romero Martínez, José Abelino Cedillo, Porfirio Sorto Cedillo, Orbín Nahúm Hernández, and Ewer Alexander Cedillo Cruz were guilty of criminal damage of the mining company’s property and illegal detention of its private security chief. Arnold Alemán and Jeremías Martínez were absolved of the same charges and allowed to return home. As a result of the supreme court rulings, defence lawyers will today petition the court to immediately release the six imprisoned men. Juana Zuniga, partner of Jose Albino Cedillo was among the six found guilty, said: “We the families are in shock, but full of joy. We hope that our companions will be freed as soon as possible and allowed to return home as the defenders that they are and have always been. “Our struggle will continue until the national park is free from mining and environmental destruction.”",News/World news,Honduran supreme court orders release of six anti-mining protesters,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/11/honduras-environmentalists-mining-protesters-court-ruling
2/12/2022,"The province of Ontario has invoked a state of emergency and says it will use the threat of hefty fines, jail time and vehicle licence seizures to end a blockade that has crippled trade between Canada and the United States. Border traffic at the Ambassador Bridge, which links Windsor to Detroit, has been shut down since Monday as part of a nationwide protest against pandemic restrictions, snarling nearly C$300m of trade each day.  “There will be consequences for these actions, and they will be severe,” said premier Doug Ford as he announced the province’s plan to combat the “disruption, intimidation, and chaos” of protests that have paralyzed the country’s most critical trade route. He also called on protesters to end a “siege” of Ottawa that has drawn on for more than two weeks, saying they were effectively holding residents of the city hostage. “It’s time to leave. And it’s time to do so peacefully.” Penalties for blocking key routes, including bridges and highways, would include fines as high as C$100,000 and up to a year in jail, Ford said. A court hearing is scheduled for noon on Friday as the city of Windsor seeks an injunction to forcibly remove protesters from the international bridge. Mayor Drew Dilkens has called the blockade “a national crisis” and officials in the US have grown impatient with the stalemate which has slowed hundreds of millions in cross-border trade. The US homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, and the transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, urged their Canadian counterparts “to use federal powers to resolve this situation at our joint border”, a White House official said on Thursday. Ahead of Ford’s announcement, protesters opened one lane of the bridge to allow traffic through. But as the delays ripple through the economy, a number of automakers, some of the largest employers in the region, have been forced to scale back production. “Today, the best advice I have for people illegally blocking the Ambassador Bridge is to GO HOME,” tweeted Flavio Volpe, head of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association. “The immeasurable damage you have SELFISHLY done to [Canada] will be shouldered by your fellow citizens who will be talking about you for the next 30 years. ‘I lost my job for your stunt.’” Friday’s announcement by Ford, leader of the Progress Conservative party of Ontario, marks his government’s second legal action against protesters and their truck blockades. Earlier this week, his government obtained a court order to freeze any donations meant for the protesters raised through GiveSendGo, using a provision of Canada’s criminal code includes a clause that allows funds outside the country to be frozen. On Thursday, the American online fundraising platform claimed that Canada had “absolutely ZERO jurisdiction” over how the company managed its funds. Ford’s declaration of a state of emergency in the province follows a similar declaration by the city of Ottawa last week, and comes in sharp contrast to federal Conservatives, who previously cheered on the protesters but have started backtracking their support. On Thursday, however, interim Conservative leader Candice Bergen called on protesters to dismantle their blockades and return home. “The economy you want to see reopened is hurting. You protested because you love your country and you want your freedoms back. That message has been heard,” she said. Bergen had previously called the convoy of truckers in Ottawa a “passionate, patriotic and peaceful” group of Canadians concerned about freedom at a time of Covid-19 restrictions, posing for pictures with protesters. Bergen faced criticism last week after an internal email showed that she had been reluctant to call on protesters to leave, instead wanting to make the issue a problem for the prime minister. Prime minister Justin Trudeau met with opposition leaders Thursday night, but has so far ruled out meeting with the protesters, who have called for pandemic health measures like vaccine and mask mandates to be fully repealed. Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan have scaled back their public health restrictions in recent days and Ontario has indicated it too might rescind certain rules. But Ford said any decision will be made based on consultations with the province’s health officials, rejecting the notion that the protests have played a role. “I will never ever negotiate with people that break the law,” he said.",News/World news,"Ontario declares state of emergency, threatening fines and jail time to end blockade ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/11/ontario-state-emergency-threatens-fines-jail-time-end-blockade
2/12/2022,"A hitman has been found guilty of murdering a reality television star’s brother in “a tit-for-tat rivalry” between two major crime gangs. Flamur Beqiri, 36, was shot dead on the doorstep of his £1.7m home in Battersea, south-west London, in front of his wife as she shielded their two-year-old son on Christmas Eve 2019.  Beqiri, the brother of The Real Housewives of Cheshire star Misse Beqiri, was a kingpin in an international drugs gang, Southwark crown court was told. Anis Hemissi, 24, was found guilty of murdering Beqiri as well as possession of a firearm after a two-month trial at the south London court. Hemissi, a professional kickboxer, disguised himself in a latex mask for the killing and opened fire 10 times with a pistol, hitting Beqiri with eight bullets from behind. The senior Crown Prosecution Service prosecutor Louise Attrill said the murder was part of a “a tit-for-tat rivalry between two very significant organised crime groups”. “It is an international assassination which required meticulous planning and involved a group of organised criminals recruiting a team to carry out this shocking and brutal murder,” she said. Beqiri, who had joint Swedish and Albanian nationality, claimed to be in the music business but had been involved in the international drugs trade since 2007 as part of a gang led by Daniel Petrovski, 38, the court was told. He had been a target since the summer of 2019, and by November the rival gang’s planning had stepped up as an associate, Estevan Pino-Munizaga, travelled to London for about 14 hours. Pino-Munizaga rented a flat in Oyster Wharf, visited Beqiri’s house nearby and bought a distinctive ladies’ bicycle with a basket. Another associate bought a litter picker on a later trip to the capital. The bike was used by Hemissi to carry out reconnaissance three days before the murder, once dressed as a street cleaner, wearing a latex mask, sunglasses and hi-vis work clothes, while holding the litter picker and a black bin bag. The outfit and bike were abandoned when a local resident, Jeremy Lyons, became suspicious after seeing Hemissi working on public and private streets, telling the hitman: “Get away from this estate please.” Hemissi acquired a replacement bike, which he parked on the Thames path and used to make his getaway after carrying out the shooting. Hemissi, who flew into London on 20 December, left the country to go to Copenhagen, Denmark, in the early hours of Christmas Day. He was arrested on his return after a holiday in Thailand. DS Brett Skowron said: “This murder was meticulously planned by the suspects and involved a number of different men travelling to the UK in the months leading up to Mr Beqiri being fatally shot.” Estevan Pino-Munizaga, 35, was acquitted of murder found guilty of an alternative charge of manslaughter. Tobias Andersson, 32, and Bawer Karaer, 23, also from Sweden, were acquitted of both charges. Clifford Rollox, 31, from Islington, north London, and Claude Isaac Castor, 31, a Dutch national from Sint Maarten in the Caribbean, were found guilty of perverting the course of justice after being hired locally to clean up the flat where the killers had stayed.

2/12/2022,"As dust settles along the empty corridors of Westminster with parliament in recess, most Tory MPs are looking forward to a break from the never-ending swirl of speculation about Boris Johnson’s political future. But while the open chatter about leadership challenges dies down, possible candidates and their allies are continuing to tap up donors, sketch out policy details and organise teams and office space.  “They’re all still working away in the background,” one MP said. “Boris will leave one day – whenever that is – and they want to be ready to hit the ground running.” Johnson’s possible successors are locked in a silent dance, quietly circling him and preparing “oven-ready” leadership bids but wary of moving early or brazenly. “There are a lot of discussions happening in hermetically sealed rooms between two or three advisers,” a minister said. “If the candidate themselves is even seen to lift a finger, it will be over.” The two frontrunners are widely known. Liz Truss, chided as the “secretary of state for Instagram” by some colleagues, headed to Russia this week amid mounting fears about an invasion of Ukraine. Often keen for a photoshoot or inviting comparisons with Margaret Thatcher, the foreign secretary was snapped in a thick black fur coat and matching hat pounding the streets of Moscow and pointing at tanks. Within hours, some newspapers were remarking on the resemblance with a similar, camel-coloured outfit worn by Thatcher on a trip to the Russian capital in 1987. One Tory MP rolled their eyes and remarked that temperatures in Moscow were warmer than usual for the time of year. Another noted that given her recent foreign trips, the meetings nicknamed “fizz with Liz” she held with colleagues “seem to have fizzled out”. The furthest Rishi Sunak has been able to flee from problems in No 10 is Devon, which he visited last month instead of flanking Johnson in the Commons chamber after it was revealed that a “bring your own booze” party invite had been issued to 100 Downing Street staff. Also known for his sharp brand, Sunak appeared this week in black tie at a British Asian Trust event in London. He set hares running by refusing to rule out standing if an election were to be held, dismissing it as a “hypothetical situation”. Sunak’s Treasury team are believed to be ardent supporters, including the economic secretary to the Treasury, John Glen, and the parliamentary private secretary Claire Coutinho. However, the announcement of financial support designed to help with soaring energy bills has angered those who think the chancellor needs to rein in spending. A government source said: “It’s very easy to piss free money out the door; how he handles the economy now is what he should be judged on. That’s why he’s in more of a rush.” They added that a recent press conference where Sunak stood at a podium bearing the words “Downing Street”, as well as reports he was putting the finishing touches to a draft website for his leadership bid, had “pissed a lot of people off”. Allies of Truss have also briefed that Sunak is “much weaker than her” on China – an attack designed to wound his standing among MPs on the China Research Group. In the cabinet, the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, is considered impressive by colleagues for his performance as vaccines minister, while another senior minister was said to have raised eyebrows by hiring staff to work on “social media” with contracts lasting three months. Mark Harper, an ex-chief whip, joked at a recent fundraiser about the slogan for his campaign in 2019: “It’s time for a party where everyone’s invited.” As chair of the Covid Recovery Group, he could highlight his longstanding opposition to the last two year’s tough restrictions. Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the foreign affairs committee, is touted as a candidate who could secure the one-nation caucus’s endorsement. He has already declared his ambition to run, but a lack of ministerial experience and too strong a focus on international affairs may see him not survive far into the contest. Also spoken about as a leadership contender is Penny Mordaunt, a Brexiter and former defence secretary who was booted out of the cabinet by Johnson in 2019 for having supported Jeremy Hunt in the leadership contest. Hunt himself is also touted by some of the core team who helped him into the run-off ballot last time, but some believe a fresh candidate is needed for the next race. Michael Gove has in effect ruled himself out of standing. “Been there, knocked back twice, won’t be doing that again,” he has admitted. If he does run because he feels he has nothing to lose, Gove may struggle to convince colleagues he represents a clear enough break with the past, given several of his advisers are close friends with Carrie Johnson. A curtailing of her perceived influence in Downing Street has long been called for by some backbenchers. MPs are even wary of being falsely linked to a leadership challenge. One invited to an innocent dinner by the former cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom was afraid of accepting, for fear word would get out and it would be painted as a plot. There was also twitchiness when Conservative party headquarters carried out a check to make sure membership records were correct. The move led some MPs to interpret it as preliminary work for a membership ballot – a view firmly denied by those working in the building.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson’s would-be successors quietly prepare their bids,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/11/boris-johnsons-would-be-successors-quietly-prepare-their-bids
2/12/2022,"Boris Johnson is facing calls to distance himself from the process to select the new head of the Metropolitan police, as the force is currently investigating whether he and others in Downing Street broke lockdown laws. Opposition MPs and one senior backbench Tory expressed particular alarm after an unnamed “ally” of Johnson briefed the media that the Met would need to be “very certain” before considering fining the prime minister, and should show discretion.  The choice of who will take over from Cressida Dick, who stepped down on Thursday after the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, made it clear she had lost his confidence, is ultimately up to the home secretary, Priti Patel, a longtime ally of Johnson. Khan said he had lost confidence that Dick could improve an allegedly misogynistic, racist and closed culture blighting Britain’s biggest force. Sir Bob Neill, a senior Tory MP and chair of the Commons justice committee, said it was “completely inappropriate to suggest that there should be any special treatment for anyone involved in these inquiries and any suggestion of political pressure on the police is completely reprehensible”, adding that No 10 “would do well to disown it”. The Liberal Democrats have argued that given the circumstances, a replacement should be endorsed by the cross-party Commons home affairs committee. “Boris Johnson is under criminal investigation by the Met. We cannot leave it to him and his allies to pick its next leader,” said Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dems’ home affairs spokesperson. “Any impression that the Conservatives are hand-picking someone who will go easy on No 10 would be disastrous for public confidence in the police.” Earlier, an unnamed “senior ally” of Johnson was quoted by the Times as saying police should be extremely wary about any decision to fine the prime minister, an event that could see him toppled. “There is inevitably a degree of discretion here,” they said. “Do you want the Metropolitan police deciding who the prime minister is? They have to be very certain.” Priti Patel said on Friday that “strong and decisive new leadership” would be required to “restore public confidence” in the force after a series of scandals. The leader of the National Black Police Association (NBPA) said Dick had been “the most defensive and dismissive” leader of a British police force. “The vast majority of police officers put on their uniform and do their best to protect the public,” said Insp Andy George, “but time and again we have seen a culture of fear within the [Met] – a fear of challenging inappropriate behaviour, and even when that behaviour is challenged, it is rarely dealt with robustly. The officer reporting discrimination can often find themselves being targeted for speaking out. “Defending the indefensible and failing to tackle the widespread issues of racism, misogyny and bullying allows bullies and poor behaviour to thrive and does a disservice to the many hardworking police officers across London and the UK. I have the privilege of speaking to many leaders in policing, and I found Dame Cressida Dick to be the most defensive and dismissive leader I met.” Separately, it emerged on Friday that the Met initially declined in December last year to investigate widespread reports of illicit social gatherings in and around Downing Street in part because no one had admitted them and there was no footage on social media. The details emerged in a document connected to a challenge to the decision not to investigate by the legal campaign group the Good Law Project, which is seeking a judicial review of the Met’s decision and reasoning. A document from the police force’s lawyers, in response to the claim, pointed to guidelines saying it did not investigate Covid breaches retrospectively, given their relatively minor nature and limited resources. At the time the first decision was made, any details about the gatherings were “fairly vague”, the document said, detailing the reasons given by a senior officer, whose named had been redacted. The officer, it said, “observed that the press reports did not identify who had been at the gatherings, no one had come forward to admit presence at any of the gatherings, and there was no evidence from social media showing these gatherings taking place, and from which those present could be identified”. It went on: “It followed that if these events had taken place, the organisers could not be identified from the material available to the police at that time, and nor could [the officer] draw any conclusions as to whether the gatherings breached the Covid regulations, and if so, whether those present at the gatherings had no reasonable excuse for their presence at the gatherings.” The force changed its mind last month and is now investigating the claims. But Jolyon Maugham, the director of the Good Law Project, said the reasons were “profoundly troubling”. He said: “It points to a Met that does not want to investigate potential criminality in government or is excessively deferential to those in power.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson urged to distance himself from selection of new Met police chief,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/11/boris-johnson-urged-distance-himself-selection-new-met-police-chief
2/12/2022,"Jacob Rees-Mogg reminds me of a kipper. A very specific kipper, resting on a plastic pillow of ice, which intruded into the public consciousness back in 2019, when Boris Johnson held it aloft, proclaiming it as an example of the absurd, pettifogging rules imposed by Brussels on the yeoman traders of Britain. Naturally, Johnson’s claims fell apart on inspection. There was no European directive mandating a cushion of ice for the sleeping fish. On the contrary, the ice pillow was demanded by a British rule, drawn up by British officials. Nothing to do with the EU. The episode came back to me when Rees-Mogg, newly appointed minister for Brexit opportunities and government efficiency, appealed to readers of the Sun to write in and tell him “of ANY petty old EU regulation that should be abolished”. That’s because Johnson’s kipper illustrated not only his serial dishonesty on matters European – already well-documented – but also a gap in the Brexiters’ arsenal. That gap was fairly well concealed in the 2016 referendum campaign, but Rees-Mogg’s plea in the Sun, like Johnson’s kipper, has exposed it.  Here’s how it can be identified. Take the Brexiters at their word – that leaving was about more than ending European immigration – and ask them to name some other reform that Britain badly needed but which proved unachievable so long as we remained in the EU: a specific change that only Brexit could unlock. The committed leaver will struggle and sputter, before either mentioning blue passports or else retreating into abstract nouns: “freedom” or “sovereignty”. Press them for a concrete, real-world benefit of Brexit, one that survives scrutiny, and they wilt. They either end up making something up, as Johnson did, or else phoning a friend – like Rees-Mogg’s call-out to Sun readers. Perhaps we’re being unfair. After all, Johnson is always telling us that Britain’s swift authorisation of Covid vaccines was possible only because we were outside the EU. Except that, too, is false. The vaccine decisions were taken during the transition period, when the UK was still bound by EU rules. There was no need to leave to make that happen. Surely there must be something. Or is “Brexit opportunities” an oxymoron, on a par with “Ebola upsides”? The trade expert Sam Lowe gamely offers that, “Consumers could benefit from the UK embracing a position as a regulatory freeloader in the medical devices space: but this is not without its risks.” Wonder why they never put that on the side of a bus. If the worst we could say of Brexit was that it hasn’t delivered any of its promised gains, maybe we could let it pass. But Brexit is inflicting grave losses, starting with deep economic pain, even if that pain has been well camouflaged by Covid and by the omertà imposed by a Labour leadership that would rather talk about almost anything else. The evidence of the hurt is in abundant supply. On Wednesday, the public accounts committee reported on the “clear increase in costs, paperwork and border delays” that Brexit has imposed on UK businesses. The next day it was the turn of the Office for National Statistics, whose business survey found that more than half of the UK’s importers and exporters now cite additional paperwork and higher transportation costs as problems, with those two issues their biggest headaches by a wide margin. The phone-in programmes hum with British entrepreneurs, plenty of them leave voters, now driven to despair, forced to spend precious, exhausting hours filling in forms they never used to have to fill in and paying costs they never used to have to pay. Ignore the talk of the greatest growth since the second world war: that’s just a function of the economy having collapsed so badly in 2020. Note instead the Bank of England’s forecast of 1.25% growth in 2023, falling to just 1% in 2024. David Smith, economics editor of the Sunday Times and no remoaner fanatic, puts that down partly to Covid but partly to the “adverse fiscal consequences of leaving the EU”, which left the country “with a budget hole that has had to be filled with higher taxes. We now have a high-tax economy strangled by red tape and hampered by trade restrictions.” The people who led us off this cliff continue to pretend that none of this is happening. In a facepalm moment in the Commons this week, the pro-Brexit MP for Dover, Natalie Elphicke, complained about the “miles of traffic jams” besetting her constituency. Those are because of the laborious checks and delays that now confront lorries coming into the port, but Elphicke insisted the jams were “not because of Brexit but because of Brussels bureaucracy”. Like many Brexiters, she is outraged that when you leave the EU, the EU treats you as if you’ve left the EU. Wherever you look, it’s the same picture. For all the fur-hat photo-ops in Moscow, Britain is no more than a bit player in the current crisis over Ukraine. Before Brexit, the UK was one of the three decisive members in an economic bloc that stood between the US and China as the most powerful in the world. Outside the EU, and having broken our commitment on overseas aid and forsaken the soft power that came with it, the UK is struggling to stay relevant. Meanwhile, the delicate constitutional machinery that kept Northern Ireland at peace has been smashed. At the same time, those other parts of the UK that once relied on EU cash now face a government that has broken its manifesto promise to plug the gap previously filled by Brussels funds. That deprives Wales, which voted to leave the EU, of close to £1bn worse off over the next three years. This is what Rees-Mogg should be reading in his mailbag. That Brexit has inflicted great losses on this country; that the supposed offsets for those losses don’t offset them at all; and that there are next to no “opportunities” worthy of the name. Brexit is a rank failure. I understand why our politics cannot yet say as much, that a decent interval has to pass between 2016 and that moment. But that moment will come eventually – and when it does, it threatens to arrive with a mighty fury.  Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion,How can Jacob Rees-Mogg find ‘Brexit opportunities’?

2/12/2022,"UK exports of goods to the EU have fallen by £20bn compared with the last period of stable trade with Europe, according to official figures marking the first full year since Brexit. Numbers released on Friday by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that the combined impact of the pandemic and Britain’s exit from the single market caused a 12% fall in exports between January and December last year compared with 2018.  Highlighting the disproportionate impact of leaving the EU, exports to the rest of the world excluding the 27-nation bloc dropped by a much smaller £10bn, or about 6% compared with 2018 levels. The ONS compared trade performance against figures from three years ago because that was the last year before distortions caused by firms stockpiling ahead of Brexit deadlines and the spread of Covid-19. Despite the disruption, the EU remains the UK’s largest trading partner. However, for the first time since comparable records began in 1997, the UK now spends more importing goods from the rest of the world than it does from the EU. For shipments sent the other way, UK goods imported from the EU were down almost 17%, or about £45bn, compared with 2018. In comparison, imports from the rest of the world increased by almost 13%, or about £28bn. With the EU accounting for just over half of UK exports worldwide, economists said Brexit was serving as an extra headwind for Britain, compounding the disruption from Covid being felt across advanced economies. “UK exporters are continuing to lose market share,” said Gabriella Dickens, an economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. Although trade levels have picked up in recent months, data from the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis show that real goods exports from advanced economies were 3.8% above their 2018 average in November, outpacing the UK. The hardest-hit commodities recorded dramatic falls. Outbound shipments of clothing and footwear to the EU were both down by almost 60% compared with 2018. Food and live animal exports – for which more stringent border checks are required – were down almost 18%, while vegetable exports dropped by almost 40%. Shipments of cars to the EU, heavily disrupted by global supply chain issues and Covid, were down by a quarter. Guillermo Larbalestier, a trade economist at the University of Sussex, said the drop in vegetable exports was probably linked to a fall in the number of seasonal workers available to pick and process crops, more burdensome paperwork and the difficulty in exporting perishable goods in the face of extended delays at the border. Clothing exports have been affected because a high proportion of garments sold by UK retailers are made in Asia or the US, making them ineligible for the tariffs negotiated in the post-Brexit trade deal. However, the latest figures do suggest a recovery from the worst of the Brexit damage seen in January 2021, just after Britain’s departure, when exports to the EU plunged by 40%. According to the latest figures, UK exports to the EU were about £200m higher in December 2021 than the same month in 2018, but much of this was driven by an increase in wholesale gas prices on international energy markets. Business leaders have warned that border restrictions and reams of red tape have pushed up costs and added to delivery times, permanently undermining the competitiveness of UK goods on the continent. Sixty-seven percent of firms experienced a challenge when exporting and 72% when importing in the last month, according to ONS surveys. “There is a lot more friction on trade, which you would expect to have a more medium-to long-term impact,” said Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS. Gareth Thomas, the shadow international trade minister, said the government had exaggerated the benefits of trade deals with countries outside the EU that have yet to be negotiated. “Ministers are not doing enough to support our exporters in markets outside Europe, while the deal they negotiated with the EU has led to long lorry queues into Dover, a big increase in red tape and a significant decline in trade,” he said.

2/12/2022,"Men who have been convicted for homosexual acts on the Isle of Man will be automatically pardoned later this year in what campaigners said was a long overdue and necessary change in law. Homosexuality was decriminalised on the Isle of Man in 1992 and its first Gay Pride event took place last summer.  Jane Poole-Wilson, the home affairs minister, said new legislation would come into force in June at the latest. The new act will pardon those convicted for a historical sexual offence if the act in question is no longer a crime. While the pardons will be automatic, people will have to apply to have historical convictions struck from their records in a “disregard process”. Two years ago the island’s then chief minister apologised for the way gay men had been treated, having had their homes raided and been put on trial for consensual sexual activity. “Our previous laws discriminated against and criminalised men solely for who they were and who they loved,” said Howard Quayle. “The previous law reflected a different time, a different place. An island of the past. Those who were convicted of these crimes, and their loved ones, should no longer have to shoulder the burden of guilt. They should be seen as innocent. “All those people affected – the men themselves, their partners, wider family and friends – they deserve an unqualified apology from us.” The forthcoming pardons were welcomed by Alan Shea, a hero of the Manx battle for gay rights. On 5 July 1991, the Manx bank holiday of Tynwald Day, he wore a concentration camp uniform fashioned from Marks & Spencer pyjamas to petition parliament to legalise homosexuality, making parallels with the Nazi persecution of gay people. Soldiers hissed at Shea as he walked to Tynwald Hill to argue that he should not face life in jail just for having sex with his partner, Stephen Moore, now his husband. On camera, a furious man denounced Shea and his friends as local children looked on with interest. “It’s good that people are finally being pardoned, but we are still waiting for an apology from the chief constable of the Isle of Man police to apologise for the way the force persecuted gay people,” said Shea. He was unable to get a job for 10 years after The Tynwald Day protest and claims his house was put under constant surveillance by police, questioning everybody who came in and out. Shea was never arrested but has friends who were, some of whom left the island, never to return. “Many of them are still haunted with memories of what happened,” he said. Peter Tatchell, the gay rights campaigner, said: “This decision is long overdue and necessary given the intense persecution LGBT+ people faced on the Isle of Man in the decades after homosexuality was significantly decriminalised in the rest of the UK.” He echoed Shea’s call for a police apology, saying: “The Isle of Man police went out of their way to target and persecuted gay and bisexual men and conducted a witch-hunt that was unprecedented in the UK.” In 2017 the UK issued thousands of pardons for gay men, after the 2013 royal pardon granted by the Queen to Alan Turing, the mathematician who broke the German Enigma codes during the second world war. He killed himself in 1954, at the age of 41, after his conviction for gross indecency. The Isle of Man is not part of the UK but is a self-governing British Crown Dependency with its own parliament, government and laws. The UK government, on behalf of the crown, is ultimately responsible for its international relations and defence, and provides consular services for its 84,000 citizens.",News/UK news,Isle of Man to pardon men convicted for homosexual acts,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/11/isle-of-man-pardon-men-convicted-homosexual-acts
2/12/2022,"A vast windfarm off the Norfolk coast has been approved by ministers for a second time after a local man convinced a high court judge to overturn the first decision a year ago. The high court verdict last February forced the government to reconsider the plans by the Swedish renewables firm Vattenfall to build two offshore windfarms capable of generating enough green electricity to power the equivalent of 4m UK homes.  But on Friday Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, reapproved the Norfolk Vanguard offshore windfarm, more than a year and a half after first giving the project the nod. His department approved the Norfolk Boreas windfarm, its sister project, at the end of last year. The projects were temporarily derailed last year after a legal challenge by a local resident, Raymond Pearce, raised concerns about the impact on the landscape and the view. Pearce, who lives near Reepham in Norfolk, argued that ministers had not taken into account the “cumulative impacts” of the two projects and had given “inadequate” reasons for not doing so. The concerns centred on Vattenfall’s plans for a substation for both projects about 40 miles from the coast at Necton, which would require cables to pass within 80 metres of Pearce’s house. The high court judge added that the plans had attracted “substantial objections” from the local community, too. Conservationists also raised concerns about the safety of endangered birds in the area. Work on the windfarms, located almost 30 miles off the coast, is now expected to begin in 2023 and would “help to cement and maintain East Anglia as a UK renewable energy powerhouse” that could support thousands of jobs in the local area, according to Vattenfall. Danielle Lane, Vattenfall’s UK boss, said the approval was a “major step forward for a project that will help to unlock the huge potential of offshore wind for the UK”. “We’ll be working even more closely now with local communities as we begin to take the project towards construction,” Lane said. “This will include preparatory works on the ground, but also work with our local partners to make sure we get our plans absolutely right to maximise benefits to the region.” The industry group RenewableUK said the approval would also secure “significant investment in much-needed new energy infrastructure” to help the UK meet its climate targets. “The government has set the industry a target of nearly quadrupling our current offshore wind capacity to 40 gigawatts by the end of this decade,” said RenewableUK’s chief executive, Dan McGrail. “Giving the go-ahead to a major project like Norfolk Vanguard is a big boost to help us to get there. It also demonstrates to the rest of the world that the UK is committed to taking significant practical action against climate change,” he said.",News/Environment,Windfarm off Norfolk coast gets second green light after court battle,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/11/business-secretary-approves-vast-offshore-windfarm-norfolk-vanguard
