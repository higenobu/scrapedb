1/2/2022,"An NYPD officer catching a nap in his car between two New Year‚Äôs shifts took a random bullet to the head outside a Harlem precinct house early Saturday, authorities said. The officer awoke in the parking lot outside the 25th Precinct stationhouse to find the window of his personal vehicle shattered and blood dripping from a painful head wound, police said. He was taken to New York Presbyterian Hospital, where a bullet fragment was removed from his fractured skull, authorities said. He was expected to make a full recovery from the bizarre shooting, as the closed window absorbed most of the impact. New Mayor Eric Adams, in his first day on the job, promised to rein in the citywide gun violence under his administration. ‚ÄúThis is not going to be a city of disorder, this is not going to be a city of violence,‚Äù said the ex-NYPD captain. ‚ÄúThis city is returning from the violent past to a place that is safe to raise our children and families.‚Äù According to NYPD Chief of Detectives James Essig, the officer was awakened around 6:15 a.m. by rain coming through the broken glass and quickly felt the pain in his head. When the cop got out of the car, he and a sergeant found the deformed bullet. The officer was asleep inside the lot on E. 119th St. after finishing an eight-hour New Year‚Äôs Eve shift in Central Park around 2 a.m., with a second tour set to begin at 7 a.m. Police officials said he opted to sleep in his car because the precinct‚Äôs dormitory was full. The cop, whose wife was with him at the hospital, was not the target of the gunshot ‚Äî which was likely fired from some distance away, said new Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell. Bullet fragments were pulled from the car as well as his head, and she added there were no 911 calls for a gunshot nor did any officers outside the precinct hear anything.. ‚ÄúWe are extremely grateful that our officer is recovering as we know this could have been a very tragic outcome,‚Äù said Sewell, who has vowed to bring down gun violence in the five boroughs. ‚ÄúI also do believe this incident underscores that there are far too many guns out there in the wrong hands.‚Äù Cops were searching the area for video and checking area rooftops for ballistic evidence. The shot came through the rear driver‚Äôs side window as the cop slept behind the wheel. The precinct parking lot was roped off as detectives collected evidence. No arrests have been made. Pat Lynch, the president of the Police Benevolent Association, the city‚Äôs largest police union, said the shooting ‚Äúshows the magnitude of the issues and the problems we face.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe was in a police parking lot and was still shot,‚Äù Lynch said. ‚ÄúIt shows us the dangers police officers face always.‚Äù",U.S./NY Daily News,NYPD cop sleeping in his car between New Year‚Äôs shifts takes random bullet to the head outside Harlem precinct,https://news.yahoo.com/nypd-cop-hit-stray-bullet-175200788.html

1/2/2022,"NAPLES, Fla. (AP) ‚Äî Body camera footage released by authorities showed a man screaming in pain and pleading for help just before a sheriff's deputy shot a Malayan tiger that had grabbed the man's arm at a Florida zoo. The Collier County Sheriff's Office said the man was seriously injured Wednesday evening when he entered an unauthorized area near the tiger's enclosure at Naples Zoo at Caribbean Gardens. The 8-year-old tiger named Eko later died. The man worked for a third-party cleaning service contracted to clean restrooms and the gift shop, the sheriff's office and the zoo said. He was hospitalized and his condition was not available on Friday. The body camera video released Thursday by the sheriff's office appeared to show the tiger‚Äôs jaw wrapped around the man‚Äôs arm between his hand and elbow . ‚ÄúPlease, please help me, please,‚Äù the man screamed during a nearly 9-minute call with a sheriff's office dispatcher. The dispatcher is heard mistaking the man's screams for a woman and calling him m'am during the call. The man could be seen on video bracing his body against the enclosure with his leg in the air and his shoulder in the dirt. A zoo statement said that after the facility had closed Wednesady to the public, 26-year-old River Rosenquist jumped a public barrier fence into an unauthorized area in front of the tiger habitat. ‚ÄúIt is believed that he was trying to feed or pet the tiger through the enclosure fence to the point where the tiger was able to reach him and pull his arm into the enclosure,‚Äù the statement said, adding a deputy rushed to the scene. ‚ÄúAfter the deputy initially tried to get the tiger to release the arm, he was left with no option but to shoot the animal to save the young man‚Äôs life. The tiger was confirmed dead by Naples Zoo‚Äôs veterinarian,‚Äù the statement added. According to the sheriff's office, the tiger had retreated back into its enclosure after being shot. The Malayan tiger is one of the smallest tiger species found throughout the southern and central Malay Peninsula and southern parts of Thailand, according to Malaysian Wildlife. It is the national symbol of Malaysia. In 2016, a Malayan tiger attacked and killed a zookeeper at the Palm Beach Zoo.
