2/22/2022,"Mortgage rates surged to the highest level in two years, leaving homebuyers on high alert as further increases loom. “Things aren’t going back down,” DLB Financial Services CEO Debbie Boyd told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). “So we have to quit thinking this is a bubble and just start thinking that this is it now. This is the real thing.” The rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage — the most common loan for homebuyers — increased to 3.69% last week from 3.55% the previous week. That’s the highest level since January 2020, according to Freddie Mac, and well above the average of 2.73% a year ago. The surge in rates followed an increase in 10-year Treasury yields, which rose above 2% for the first time since 2019 this week. Solid employment growth for January and a high inflation report are likely to accelerate the Federal Reserve’s plan to increase benchmark interest rates to combat inflation, which is running at a 40-year high. “I think we're going to have three, maybe four hikes this year. Doesn't mean they're all going to be huge,” Boyd said. “But even an eighth of a point, or a quarter of a point does trickle down through the markets, and it makes everybody nervous.” Though recent rate increases have helped fuel homebuyer sentiment to plummet, the housing market has remained red hot. “If you need a new house, you're going to go buy a house. If you're moving across the country and have to relocate, you're going to be buying a house,” Boyd said. “It doesn't matter what the price is.” The average sales price across the country for an existing single-family home rose 14.6% to $361,700 in the fourth quarter of 2021, according to the National Association of Realtors. As a result, entry-level homebuyers generally spent up to 25.6% of their household income on mortgage payments, further straining affordability for young buyers. “Real estate markets are caught in a lopsided dynamic with many buyers eager to find the right home before rates rise even higher, but very few available homes for sale as a result of almost a decade and a half of underbuilding,” said George Ratiu, Realtor.com’s manager of economic research. “The benefits that ultra-low interest rates provided over the last two years are wearing off and affordability is becoming a huge hurdle for many buyers.” Still, rates are historically low. By comparison, the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage reached an all-time high of over 18% in 1981, according to Freddie Mac. “We are used to now historically low interest rates. I remember when I got a 5.50% rate several years ago, like 10 years ago, and that was a great rate,” Boyd said. “So it's all in what we're used to. We've forgotten that rates were higher than 2% at one time.” While rising mortgage rates will likely price out many young and moderate-income first-time homebuyers, now could be a good time to lock in a rate if you want to refinance or are looking to invest. Homeowners rushed to refinance their mortgages in January during a three-week break from rate increases that added more than a half-point to the 30-year fixed rate last month. “Call it a preemptive strike of getting a refinance in place before mortgage rates run any higher,” Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH.com, previously told Yahoo Money. Last week’s increase in rates cut down the population of high-quality refinance candidates who could shave three-quarters of a point from their mortgage to 5.1 million, according to figures mortgage technology and data provider Black Knight previously gave Yahoo Money. That’s down from 5.9 million the previous week. So now’s the time to refinance. The same holds true for any real estate investors, Boyd said, before rates climb to 4% in the second half of the year. “So you're going to be buying a little bit more expensive with a little more expensive money. But it's not going to get cheaper,” Boyd said. “So if this is the market you want to get in, you need to get in now.” Gabriella is a personal finance reporter at Yahoo Money.

2/22/2022,"Volatility, and descending trends, that’s the path the markets are taking these days. While the usual headwinds are all in play, the chief worry now is coming from Eastern Europe. Will Russia invade, or won’t it? A shooting conflict, involving a superpower, taking place in one of Europe’s most agriculturally productive and mineral-rich countries, has huge potential for political and economic fallout, enough to keep pundits and market watchers awake at night. But an in-depth analysis of geopolitical events over the past several decades, by Truist Advisory, would suggest that investors may not need to worry quite so much. The firm looked at 12 major events, including the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, the Iran hostage crisis of 1979, and the Iraq War of 2003, and followed market fluctuations for a year after each event. On average, the S&P 500 gained 8.6% in the ‘post-event’ period; the index posted a one-year gain in 9 of the 12 periods examined. Truist’s co-chief investment officer, Keith Lerner, sums up this findings, saying, “When you look at the history of geopolitical events, they tend to have a short-term impact on the markets, and as long as they don’t drive you into recession, then the markets tend to rebound... The conclusion is that we don’t think investors should overreact to this situation by itself.” With all of this in mind, let’s take a look at two stocks that have shown sharp losses recently – and are still showing substantial upside, suggesting they may jump when the geopolitical situation calms down. According to the latest TipRanks data, both are Strong Buy stocks, and both show potential for triple-digit percentage gains in the coming months. Porch Group (PRCH) The first stock we're looking at is Porch Group, an online service company offering software and platforms that connect homeowners with the services they need to maintain and improve their properties. These include home improvement and warranty, contracting, moving, and home inspection. Taken together, Porch can connect customers with service providers in every segment of the $500 billion annual home improvement market. The company went public, in December of 2020, through a SPAC transaction, and the shares saw a volatile 2021 before falling sharply from their November peak into the beginning of this year. The stock is down 68% from that peak. It’s important to note, however, that even as Porch’s share price has declined the company has continued to execute on its expansionary strategy. It announced in December the addition of the newest module in its software offerings for home inspection services, the Inspection Support Network. The new module allows homebuyers and agents to pay for inspections at the home closing. In another expansion move, in January, the company’s property and casualty insurance subsidiary Homeowners of America (HOA) announced that it is introducing services in New Mexico and Montana. HOA now operates in 14 states. Porch’s expansion continues, and the company is looking forward to its 4Q21 earnings release, set for March 1. In the last release, for 3Q21, the company increased its full-year 2021 revenue guidance from $187.5 million to $195 million. Achieving the new guidance will put the company on track for 170% year-over-year revenue growth. Looking at Porch for Berenberg Bank, analyst Nate Crosset gives an upbeat take on the broad picture. “PRCH’s differentiated business model essentially gives home service providers early access to high-intent customers (i.e., new homebuyers), delivering solid growth. The company has a substantial TAM with low penetration, which we believe leaves room for growth, while continued M&A execution could increase the TAM. Lastly, we believe the Street is underappreciating PRCH’s differentiated business model and solid growth; we think PRCH deserves a higher multiple,” Crosset opined. Crosset thinks the stock has some way to go, and by some way, we mean 157% of upside. Those are the returns investors are looking at, should the stock make it all the way to Crosset's $21 price target. No need to add, the analyst’s rating is a Buy. (To watch Crossett’s track record, click here) Overall, even though this stock’s price is down, the analysts remain bullish; PRCH has 4 positive reviews for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are selling for $8.15 and their $21.63 average price target suggests a strong upside of 165% for the year ahead. (See PRCH stock forecast at TipRanks) Renewable Energy Group (REGI) From homes, we’ll turn to energy. Renewable Energy Group, REGI, is in the biofuel business, producing renewable fuels for a variety of markets. The company has facilities to produce, distribute, and retail a wide range of fuels, including biodiesel and other transportation fuels, oils for blended heating fuels, and bio-based glycerine and methyl esters for industrial and agricultural uses. The company has 12 biorefineries -- ten located in the United States and two in Germany. Eleven of its biorefineries produce biodiesel, while its Geismar, LA biorefinery produces renewable diesel. These assets have allowed REGI to post two consecutive quarters (2Q21 and 3Q21) of rising revenues. The 3Q21 result, the last reported, of $1.01 billion was up 22% from Q2, and an impressive 73% year-over-year. The company attributed the gains to ‘higher average selling prices’ in the past six months. Earnings per share also rose, although not as much as revenues. The 83 cent EPS reports in Q3 was up from 60 cents (a gain of 38%), but was only half the Q2 value of $1.62. The divergence reflects the volatile nature of the fuel industry. In recent weeks, REGI has been expanding its operations. In January, the company acquired Amber resources, a California-based distributor of gasoline, diesel, lubricating oils, and other transportation fuel components. The move adds more than 60 million gallons per year of sales to REGI’s portfolio. In February, the company made two important announcement. First, that it will be investing in a pretreatment facility in Germany, in a project in Emden. The project will improve REGI’s ability to refine low-carbon-intensity, hard-to-convert waste fats and oils for biodiesel production in the European markets. And in the US markets, REGI has entered into a partnership with Bunker Holding Group, the world’s largest marine fuel supplier. The move will expand REGI’s footprint in the US and EU markets for marine biodiesel fuels. Despite the company’s rising revenues and continued profitability, REGI has seen its share price drop 65% over the past 12 months. In coverage for Cowen, analyst Jason Gabelman explains why he sees this drop as an opportunity for investors. ""We estimate REGI is getting 0 value for its biodiesel business (ex volumes sold with RD), and see current price levels as an attractive entry point, especially for those willing to wait until Geismar value is more reflected in equity. The stock could also benefit as investors embed value for Cali's cap-and-trade,"" Gabelman noted. ""The stock has been impacted by concerns around Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) and declining LCFS prices. Proposed RVOs should accommodate new biomass-based diesel coming online in '22, reducing competitive risk to REGI's biodiesel business,"" the analyst added. To this end, Gabelman sets an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on REGI, and his $75 price target indicates its potential for ~125% upside by the end of 2022. (To watch Gabelman’s track record, click here) Overall, REGI has managed to pick up a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating from Wall Street, based on 7 positive reviews. The stock is selling for $33.40 and the $79.71 average price target implies ~139% upside from that level.

2/22/2022,"Along with being expected to start a rate hike cycle in March, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to stop purchasing assets to add to its $9 trillion balance sheet. And while multiple rate hikes seems to be largely factored into the stock market, winding down the balance sheet — i.e., start selling assets into the market as opposed to buying — is a less understood variable. “When... the most reliable buyer with its own printing press and an incredible willingness to buy – when they step out of the market, that is a fundamental change to the marketplace,” Mohamed El-Erian, president of Queen’s College at Cambridge University and Chief Economic Advisor at Allianz, told Yahoo Finance Live this week (video above). ""So it shouldn't come as a surprise that [stock prices] are lower, because $120 billion a month of asset purchases are disappearing."" El-Erian stressed that unwinding the balance sheet ""need not be disorderly. If you can establish and you still have strong fundamentals, people will come in and take the leg up based on something much more lasting than a liquidity regime. The concern we have is by being late, the Fed also puts economic growth in play. And that means earnings become more uncertain. So that's why this is a very delicate period. There is still a window to get this right. But unfortunately, that window is closing."" The anticipation of increased Fed hawkishness is one of the reasons behind the uptick in volatility this year, with the CBOE Volatility Index averaging more than 23 thus far in 2022 after average of just under 20 in 2021. The MOVE Index, which measures Treasury market volatility, has also seen a more dramatic surge with a 19 percentage point rise so far this year. According to Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, investors have to try to factor in the shrinking of the balance sheet – what she called “a tightening cycle that is unlike any we have seen in the past” – even if it’s uniquely challenging to do so. “Unlike in past periods, they’re not giving us a playbook,” Sonders told Yahoo Finance Live. The Fed isn’t “telling us in advance: Here’s what we’re thinking in terms of balance-sheet shrink, the amount per month. Here’s what we’re thinking in terms of rate hikes. Data dependency is what they’re emphasizing, which means we’re all living day to day in terms of what the data looks like and ultimately how the Fed has to behave."" In terms of relevant data, there are two more important inflation reads before the Fed’s next meeting on March 15 and 16: the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index (commonly known as the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation) on Feb. 25; and the Consumer Price Index, due on March 10. In any case, El-Erian noted that the stakes are very high — not only in terms of market volatility and a drop in speculative asset prices (which has already been occurring), but also because of potential economic risk. ""In a perfect world, you want people to say this inflation is truly transitory,"" he explained. ""I don't need to change my behavior. But because inflation has stayed high for so long, people are changing their behavior. They're asking for compensation, higher wages, companies are raising prices."" The danger, he stressed, is when companies expect costs to continue to rise and consequently preemptively raise prices for consumers. ""The really dangerous phase is anticipatory — when you feel that to protect your purchasing power, to protect your profit margins, you need to protect against future inflation,"" El-Erian said. ""And that's what the Fed can help avoid is that inflationary expectations become a main driver of inflation."" ""We’re not there yet,"" El-Erian added, ""but if the Fed is not careful, we’ll get there.” Julie Hyman is the co-anchor of Yahoo Finance Live, weekdays 9am-11am ET.
