3/28/2022,"Kenneth Branagh has won his first Oscar following eight nominations at the 94th Academy Awards in Hollywood. Branagh took the award for best original screenplay for Belfast, his autobiographical coming-of-age film set at the advent of the Troubles. Taking to the stage, Branagh, said his story was “the search for hope and joy in face of violence and loss.” He then paid tribute to those “lost along the way”, including John Sessions and Jim Dornan, the father of Belfast’s star, Jamie Dornan. “We miss them, we love them, we will never forget them,” Branagh continued. “And we will never forget all of those lost in the heartbreaking, heartwarming, human story of that amazing city of Belfast on the fabulous island of Ireland.” Branagh, 61, is the first person to be Oscar nominated in seven different categories. He won the same award at the Baftas a fortnight ago, shortly after which he contracted Covid. Both he and Belfast star Ciaran Hinds appear to have recovered in time for the Oscars.",Arts/Film,Kenneth Branagh wins first Oscar as Belfast takes best original screenplay ,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/28/kenneth-branagh-wins-first-oscar-as-belfast-takes-best-original-screenplay
3/28/2022,"Zack Snyder’s zombie horror film, Army of the Dead, has won the Oscars’ inaugural #FanFavourite award in Hollywood. The Netflix hit, which was little-loved by critics, beat the likes of Dune, The Power of the Dog and Spider-Man: Far From Home to take the prize, which is the first in the Academy’s 94-year history to be decided by the public. Earlier in the evening, a sequence from another Snyder film – “The Flash enters the speed force from Zack Snyder’s Justice League” – was crowned “Most cheer-worthy moment” in a movie. That honour does not come with an official prize and was met with silence in the auditorium. The new #FanFavourite award was first announced by the Academy in February, in an attempt to insulate themselves from accusations of insularity. Voters could offer their opinions by Twitter or the Academy’s website. In 2018, the Oscars announced the creation of a new category for “best popular film”, only to scrap the plan a month later, following considerable backlash. Yet the potential for sabotage by handing the public the reins for #FanFavourite was hammered home once votes began flooding in for titles such as the little-seen Johnny Depp drama Minamata. The surge for this drama was thanks to a concerted effort by Depp fans upset by the star’s ostracisation following the collapse of his libel trial. The populist innovation attracted further criticism from members of the Academy after it was announced that eight craft prizes would be announced at a pre-ceremony show and edited highlights worked into the telecast. The lion’s share of these went to Dune, a sci-fi blockbuster and the only real box office hit among the best picture nominees.",Arts/Film,Army of the Dead wins Oscars 2022 #FanFavourite award,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/28/spider-man-no-way-home-oscars-2022-fan-favourite-award
3/28/2022,"The Oscars hasn’t had a host since 2018. This year Amy Schumer, Wanda Sykes and Regina Hall grasped the nettle. After an opening performance from Beyoncé on a tennis court in Compton, Los Angeles, performing Be Alive from the nominated film King Richard, Sykes concluded the opening monologue by vowing: “For you people in Florida, we’re gonna have a gay night! Gay, gay, gay!” Florida has passed a bill which will prevent LGBTQ+ issues from being discussed in classrooms. The trio also tackled Hollywood sexism, joking that three women had been hired to host “because it’s cheaper than hiring one man”. They then moved on to race, as Hall announced that she was “excited to be representing black women who are standing proud” – to which Schumer replied: “and I am celebrating unbearable white women who call the cops when you get a little too loud.” Hall joked that she was “disappointed that Space Jam 2 didn’t get best special effects for the hairline they gave LeBron James.” James added that “Black Twitter is going to love that,” to which Schumer said “What’s black Twitter?” These jokes will be seized on by right-wingers who decry the Oscars as a showcase for the woke Hollywood elite, but they made the assembled A-listers laugh. The trio also joked about the fact that the technical awards are no longer televised –close to the bone given that Dune had just won four awards. “It was a controversial and difficult decision but I think we’ve moved on,” said Hall, as the lights went off in the Dolby theatre. The rest of the opening jokes were largely aimed at the nominated films. Schumer said of the inscrutable and slow-moving The Power of the Dog, “I’ve watched that film three times and I’m halfway through it.” Of King Richard, she pointed out “After years of Hollywood ignoring women, we finally got a movie about the incredible Williams sisters’ … dad.” Don’t Look Up was zinged with the line: “I guess the Academy members don’t look up reviews”, before Schumer riffed on a familiar subject, saying that Leonardo DiCaprio was a climate activist “because he wants to leave a cleaner, greener world for his girlfriends.” Schumer, who returned to the stage to do a short comedy monologue on her own, also teased screenwriter Aaron Sorkin for Being the Ricardos, or, as she put it, having “the innovation to make a movie about Lucille Ball without a line that’s funny. It’s like making a movie about Michael Jordan and showing the bus trips between games.” While it wasn’t as savage a roast as Ricky Gervais used to embark on at the Golden Globes, the hosts managed to indicate that the Oscars are more inclusive – while still being funny.",Arts/Film,"Amy Schumer, Wanda Sykes and Regina Hall take on race, sexism and Hollywood in Oscars opening speech",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/28/amy-schumer-wanda-sykes-regina-hall-race-sexism-oscars-opening-speech
3/28/2022,"Lance Franklin’s 1,000th goal milestone made Australian sporting history on Friday night. Images of the crowd rushing the field and the subsequent wholesome and quirky stories of post-goal mayhem will never be erased from sports folklore. And rightly so. This was a beautiful and well handled celebration. There was no downside. A joyous, much needed moment for us all. I would be lying, however, if I said I wasn’t a little jealous of the milestones celebrated in men’s football. It’s the jealousy of a sports fan who knows no achievement of a woman in sport that isn’t accompanied by the cynicism or grumbling of a disapproving commentariat. Buddy was roundly celebrated, and those least interested were at least silent. No such respect is afforded to women and non-binary folk in football. Despite fighting a hundred years or so for legitimacy in organised sport, when women and non-binary athletes in football reach incredible milestones there is still consistent questioning of their very existence. While most champions of women’s football are accustomed to tuning out the negativity, one does wonder why they even have to? If they were to tune in, what would be made clear to them is that for some, women’s sport is still surprising, illegitimate, unwanted. When women’s football milestones are celebrated, like Darcy Vescio’s first-to-50-goals mark earlier this year, for many the conversation quickly turns to dismissive sniggering about the quality of play. It seems the expectation is that women’s sport must build the competition at the same time it competes with the already established and supported men’s counterparts. The irony however is that as far as milestones go, women in football are achieving them at a significant pace. Though not officially launched by the AFL, Caroline Wilson reported recently that nine AFL clubs are poised to appoint female assistant football coaches to their men’s coaching departments. This program is funded both by the clubs and the AFL, and is accounted for outside the salary cap. It is a significant move for the AFL given it has funded opportunities for diverse talent in the past, with this talent only to be overlooked in key roles and relegated to much more junior opportunities. This more targeted approach is expected to achieve better outcomes – and produce more milestones to celebrate. One of the most exciting recent advancements is that for the first time an AFLW game will be played on the sacred turf of the MCG. Having confidently defeated a wavering Collingwood on Sunday, the Brisbane Lions will meet a well-rested Melbourne in a preliminary final this Saturday. That this game will be played at the MCG is yet another of those recent AFLW milestones that feels like a moment of real evolution. With more women in coaching positions and commentary boxes, and the final four AFLW teams set to join the league, there is a feeling that the days of breaking through, fighting for space and the idea of women’s footy as a “novelty” offering are coming to an end. Perhaps this is the beginning of the end for AFLW: The Fledgling Years. The AFL – as is their wont – now have a neat litmus test for their own future planning. While the announcement of the game at the ‘G was deployed in classic marketing “surprise and delight” fashion, the AFL will be closely monitoring how fans support, turn up and talk about this game. So too will broadcasters and editors, with an eye on viewership, clicks and the potential for advertising dollars. In a post-Covid, economically fraught sport and media landscape, executives may be discouraged by the disparity that continues when it comes to viewership, readership and ticket sales between men’s and women’s sport. The financial bottom line will drive decision makers who perhaps lack bravery and insight. Committing to servicing men’s and women’s sports 50:50 requires faith in the decision (and growing research) that if you build it they will come. The loud celebration of achievement is a crucial part of how interest, emotional connection and support of the game is built. The act itself of celebrating heroics etches those heroes into sporting folklore. The dictionary definition of a milestone is “a significant stage or event in the development of something”. In this light, the achievements of the AFLW and its stars glisten. In scheduling this final at the home of football, competition organisers have posed the question: what could an AFLW season, alongside the men’s, look like? In answering this question, fans have one clear job – to turn up and celebrate this most important milestone.",Sport/Sport,Women’s footy milestones signal the end of AFLW: The Fledgling Years | Rana Hussain,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/28/womens-footy-milestones-signal-the-end-of-aflw-the-fledgling-years
