1/15/2022,"For a week in 2018 almost 3-year-old Crosby Bowen seemed to have a stomach bug — he was fatigued and threw up a few times. He took a turn for the worse and suddenly died. The Bowen family later learned Crosby had a brain tumor. When their daughter Annabelle, now 2, was diagnosed with cancer in February 2021, doctors started searching for a reason why the Bowen children kept developing cancer. “The doctors said, “OK, this is your second child to get cancer. Let’s test your genetics and figure this out,’” Nate Bowen, 41, Crosby and Annabelle’s dad, told TODAY. “When you have multiple children that are young that have cancers, there’s typically this genetic mutation often associated with it.” Tests uncovered that Annabelle had a rare genetic condition called Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a mutation in the TP53 gene — which normally prevents tumor growth — that increases a child or young adult’s likelihood of cancer. While this can occur spontaneously, it is often passed through families. Genetic tests revealed that Bowen also had it in July 2021 and doctors advised he undergo regular cancer screenings. Then doctors discovered that the dad had a brain tumor in September. “I had no symptoms,” Bowen said. “They did a brain MRI and then they discovered I’ve got a large tumor in my brain.” Yet while facing so many challenges, the family chooses optimism. “My daughter getting cancer led to my genetic testing, which led to cancer screenings, and allowed us hopefully to catch it early enough,” he said. “It’s one of those bittersweet things where there’s bad that comes of it. But there’s a good part.” Crosby was full of life. He moved so quickly that many photos of him show a blur or just the side of his face. “He was always going at 100 miles an hour,” Bowen said. “He was just a silly kid. He had some silly quirks about him and just a really good kid, who had a great laugh.” He adored his siblings, an older brother, Dalton, now 8, and a younger sister, Tessa, now 4. Crosby never slowed down until the week before he died. The family took him to the doctor, who first thought he had a virus. They took him home to keep him hydrated to recover, but he kept getting sicker. “He just progressively got worse over that week, mentally and physically, but nothing that screamed brain tumor,” Bowen explained. “It was more like a physical exhaustion.” On July 4, the family planned to take Crosby to an urgent care center, but Bowen took them straight to the hospital. “On the way to the hospital is likely when he had a massive heart attack or stroke or something like that and stopped breathing. We didn’t know,” he said. “But we could tell he’s really declining quickly.” At the hospital doctors worked to resuscitate Crosby. After he stabilized, doctors discovered he no longer had any brain function. After moving him to Texas Children’s Hospital, the family learned that there wasn’t more treatment to help their son. After 24 hours, Crosby was taken off life support. “It was just very traumatic because it was so sudden,” Bowen said. “We got fantastic care and they brought in a child life specialist to help the kids say goodbye to him.”The doctors showed the family a CT scan that revealed Crosby had a large mass in his brain and they said he had a glioblastoma grade 4, “a very aggressive brain tumor.” The family grieved. But they eventually wondered if more children were in their future. “We decided to have another child,” he said. “We felt there was another person meant for our family. And so we had Annabelle and she’s been awesome and great.” But at the end of 2020, they noticed Annabelle had a bump growing on her leg. They didn’t know what it was but returned to Texas Children’s Hospital. Doctors said the mass looked vascular and conducted an MRI and diagnosed Annabelle with rhabdomyosarcoma, a soft tissue cancer of the muscles. In March 2021, doctors were able to remove her entire tumor before she started chemotherapy, which will end Jan. 24. Around that time doctors started genetic testing to understand why the Bowens had two children with cancer. The doctors suspected a rare condition called Li-Fraumeni syndrome. In the condition, a mutation in the TP53 gene makes broken p53 proteins, which cannot stop cancerous tumor development, according to the Li-Fraumeni Syndrome Association. Both Annabelle and Bowen have it and it’s likely Crosby did too, though they don’t know for sure. “My parents tested negative on this mutation so I developed it on my own,” Bowen said. His wife, Allison Bowen, Dalton and Tessa do not have it. “A lot of times (a p53) mutation is associated with younger children getting cancer,” Bowen said. But Bowen never had cancer as a child. Still, doctors started monitoring him with MRIs and other cancer screenings. After being diagnosed with the brain tumor in September, he had most of it, a grade 2 astrocytoma, removed in October. He isn’t undergoing chemotherapy or radiation because it could increase his chances of developing a different type of cancer. Though depending on follow-up scans, his treatment course could change to include them. “We’re trying to be very careful and only do that if they absolutely need to,” he said. “(Doctors) took 90% of it out so I’ve still got 10% left in there.” Recovery for Bowen has been easier than he expected. But it’s tough having cancer while Annabelle also has cancer. Allison Bowen spends a lot of time in the hospital with Annabelle because if she gets a cold or a fever, she needs extra support. Despite the challenges, the family has learned a lot about one another. “I have really grown to see my wife in a different light and really respect the woman she is and how strong she is,” Bowen said. “Our love for one another has grown through the trials and we’re trying to be as positive as we can.” The family knows that cancer will always be in their lives in some way whether it's because of increased screenings, worry or another diagnosis. Annabelle is at a greater risk of developing certain cancers, including breast cancer, and Bowen could also develop another cancer. “We’ve had to really narrow down our focus and be like, ‘OK I can get through today,’ or ‘I can get through this week,’” he said. “The uncertainty of not knowing is hard and also just the weight of feeling a loss.” Having a strong faith in God and loads of support from their community, friends and family has helped. At times, it was hard to fathom such kindness and generosity. “There’s been this outpouring of love that we hardly expected or anticipated and we feel so blessed by all the people that have either prayed for us or kept us in their thoughts or sent us a little money because we really are going to max out our health care costs,” Bowen said. “We’ve been humbled and completely astounded.” Related:",Health/TODAY,Father and toddler daughter grapple with cancer diagnosis at same time,https://news.yahoo.com/father-toddler-daughter-grapple-cancer-145555788.html
1/15/2022,"The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) and its sister department are being sued by a Black man that spent almost a week in jail for a crime he didn’t commit. The officers arrested him in 2020 because he shared the same name with a white man, who was the actual suspect for the crime. According to the lawsuit filed on Jan. 7, 2022, and obtained by the Atlanta Black Star, in 2020, Shane Lee Brown was incarcerated for six days at the Henderson Detention Center and then the Clark County Detention Center after law enforcement officers from two different police departments mixed him up with another man. The man filing the suit is 23 years old, 5 feet 7, and Black. The actual man listed on the arrest warrant was 49 years old, 5 feet 11, and a white man with a “bushy white beard” and blue eyes. The arresting officers failed to properly verify the person listed on the warrant. On Jan. 8, 2020, the lawsuit states, Shane Lee Brown was driving from work when he was “pulled over by one or more unknown Henderson City Police Officers.” He didn’t have his driver’s license on him, so he gave them his name, social security number, and social security card. The officer ran the name and when he saw the same first and surname pop up with a warrant, he assumed it was the man waiting in the car they pulled over. However, if he had read the warrant, he would have seen the description of the man with an outstanding felony bench warrant for the illegal ownership or possession of a firearm. The subject of the warrant was Shane Neil Brown, a man whose first conviction was in 1994, two years before the plaintiff was born. Despite this, Shane Lee Brown was arrested and placed in Henderson Detention Center (HDC) from Jan. 8 to Jan. 10, and then transferred by the LVMPD to the Clark County Detention Center (CCDC), where he stayed until Jan. 14. Shane Lee Brown communicated over and over again that they had the wrong man, but to no avail. The lawsuit, prepared by attorney Brent Bryson, noted, “Despite being informed of this mistaken identity, none of the unknown LVMPD or LVMPD corrections officers bothered to review its own records to determine whether that Shane Lee Brown was the subject of the warrant.” “Had any of the LVMPD police or corrections officers performed any due diligence, such as comparing Shane Lee Brown’s booking photo against the existing mug shot belonging to the older, white ‘Shane Brown’ named in the warrant, comparing his fingerprints, birth date, ID No., or physical description, they could have easily determined that Shane Lee Brown was misidentified as the subject of the warrant,” it continued. A bench warrant return hearing presided over by Judge Joe Hardy was held on Jan. 14. Shane Lee Brown was appointed a public defender named Shannon L. Phenix and she shared the same information with the court that her client had been telling the officers since before his arrest. In a dramatic demonstration, she compared a mug shot filed online of the white man to the one her client took, just days ago. She also compared the identification numbers of both men, something that none of the officers had done. The judge immediately released Shane Lee Brown. The filing names the LVMPD, Henderson Police Department, the city of Henderson, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, and Henderson Police Department Chief Thedrick Andres as defendants. Bryson states, “It’s pretty hard to make a mistake of that magnitude when you have such different characteristics and races of a suspect.” On Tuesday, Jan. 11, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, City of Henderson spokeswoman Kathleen Richards gave a statement regarding the lawsuit. She said that the department will, “address the claims in their response to the court.” The LVMPD did not offer any comment. While both departments are tight-lipped, Bryson shared what he and his client’s position is, “This happens much more frequently than what the public hears about.” Another case similar to Shane Lee Brown’s is the 2018 mistaken identity of 53-year-old Timothy Ernie Diaz. Chandler, AZ police confused him with Timothy Dean Diaz, a man twenty years his junior, and arrested him in 2017. According to ABC Action, he had to borrow money from his family to post the $10,000 bond — for a crime, he did not commit. The actual suspect was a young white guy with brown hair, a completely different profile than the innocent older Hispanic man. Despite Timothy Ernie Diaz saying he was innocent, no one believed him. His son made a public records request for the report over at the Chandler Police Department and the officers then noticed that they had the wrong guy. Like Shane Lee Brown, they had not compared birth dates nor the full names of the suspect and accused. Eight days after Shane Lee Brown was released from CCDC, law enforcement found Shane Neil Brown in California. Court records show that the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Office contacted Las Vegas police and told them exactly where to pick up the wanted man. With his lawsuit, Shane Lee Brown is asking for compensatory damages of $500,000 under federal law, and an additional $50,000 minimum under state law in addition to punitive damages.
