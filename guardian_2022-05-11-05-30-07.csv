5/11/2022,"The actor Ann Davies, who has died aged 87, was a likable character player with a light touch who was a familiar face on the small screen – sometimes alongside her husband, Richard Briers. She was a gifted performer in her own right – diminutive with laughing eyes and cherubic features that lent themselves to comic characters, she proved equally capable of high drama. Television immortality came early on when when she joined forces with the first Doctor Who, William Hartnell, in 1964 in The Dalek Invasion of Earth. As Jenny, a determined and capable freedom fighter, Davies was a cold and efficient co-combatant with the series regular Barbara (Jacqueline Hill, in real life Davies’s friend and neighbour). The action required them to encounter the Daleks in arresting scenes filmed at London landmarks. At one point they smashed through a patrol with a van, which required early morning shooting in the capital to avoid the crowds. Although it was just one guest role in her long career, Davies remained in demand for Doctor Who interviews and signings. If Jenny had a harsh exterior that masked great vulnerability, then Dorothy Clarke in a 1996 adaptation of Minette Walters’ The Sculptress, starring Pauline Quirke, found Davies skilfully going the other way, misdirecting the audience with an unobtrusive, mousy persona which disguised the fact that she was the killer of the piece. Another favourite performance of hers was in Jill Hyem’s Equal Terms (1973), a two-hander in which she played a former psychiatric patient presenting a tricky case for Judy Parfitt’s novice social worker. Ann was born in Hornchurch, east London, the eldest child of Ronald Davies, a solicitor, and his wife, Sally (nee Simmonds), who worked as his secretary. Thanks to the second world war, her early education was peripatetic until she settled at the Queen’s school in Chester. Academically bright, she was encouraged by her parents and teachers towards university at Oxford or Cambridge, but her love for theatre led to her “running away to the circus” and she joined the Liverpool Playhouse as an acting stage manager aged 18. She was offered a place at Rada in London in 1956, but while at Liverpool had fallen in love with Briers after taking pity on the thin and hungry newcomer to the company and cooking him meals. They married within eight months and so she mastered her trade first at Liverpool and then in repertory at Coventry and Guildford, before making her London debut at the Arts theatre in 1959. She and Briers tried to work together where possible, including in Major Barbara (in which she was Jenny Hill, Belgrade theatre, 1958), Kenneth Branagh’s Renaissance theatre touring production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream (with Davies as the First Fairy, 1990-91) and in Simon Paisley Day’s Spike (Davies as the repressed wife, Nuffield theatre, Southampton, 2001), this time joined by their daughter Lucy and in which Davies was “perfectly cast” according to the Stage and “superb” in the opinion of the Telegraph. After her first small screen appearance in 1955, she was part of Britain’s televisual furniture for five decades, in popular drama – Z-Cars (four different roles between 1968 and 1973), Poldark (1976), Within These Walls (1975-78), Widows (1985), The Bill (three roles, 1993-96), EastEnders (1997), Grange Hill (1998-99), Doctors (2003) and Whitechapel (2013) – and comedy – Charley’s Aunt (1965), All in Good Faith (1988), After Henry (1990), and Keeping Up Appearances (1993). She was Bridget Bigwell in Alvin Rakoff’s 11-part production of John Mortimer’s Paradise Postponed (1986) and had great fun as Mrs Ripper opposite her husband’s Martin Bryce in Ever Decreasing Circles (1987-89). She also appeared in Branagh’s feature films Peter’s Friends (1992) and In the Bleak Midwinter (1995), and in the big-screen Run For Your Wife (2012). Dedicated to her family, she ensured that her daughters had the further education she had denied herself, though she later took an Open University degree. Briers died in 2013. She is survived by their daughters, Kate and Lucy, her siblings, Sally, Maggi and Richard, and two grandchildren, Harry and Rachael.

5/11/2022,"The Home Office has backed down part way through a high court hearing after an orphaned teenage asylum seeker from Eritrea feared she would be unable to sit her GCSE exams next week due to not being accommodated close to her college. During Tuesday’s hearing the department agreed to pay for travel until her exams finish next month – a sum of about £300. The ongoing court proceedings are likely to have already cost many thousands of pounds. Officials also guaranteed her a bedroom to herself so she can study in peace and quiet. The court was told the 18-year-old, who has been diagnosed with PTSD and fled her country in January 2021 to escape compulsory military conscription, experienced the trauma of witnessing sexual abuse while locked in a warehouse in Sudan. She could not attend Tuesday’s hearing because she was at school. A court order prevents her identification. She arrived in the UK in June 2021 on a small boat and was first accommodated in Kent. The Home Office then moved her to Bethnal Green in east London, where she built up a support network and started to study for GCSEs at a local college. But with almost no notice the Home Office first told her she was being moved to Hounslow in west London and then put her in a taxi with three men and sent her to Hemel Hempstead, a two-hour journey on public transport to her college. She began high court proceedings so she could return to her college and support network in east London. Four different high court judges have considered her case during the last few months. On 14 March the Home Office told the high court she would be moved back to Bethnal Green by 28 March, but this did not happen. A few weeks later on 21 April she was taken to an address there but when she arrived she had to wait outside for two hours as there was no mattress at the accommodation for her to sleep on. She was then taken away from that address and placed in her current accommodation. Her bedroom has space for two people but the Home Office has agreed not to move a second person in for the time being. She is struggling to pay for food and other essentials because it costs her £18 a week to travel to college, almost half of her weekly support payment of £40 from the Home Office. Her GCSEs are on a different site from her college further away from her accommodation and it will cost her more than £20 a week to travel there. The alternative is an eight-mile daily round trip on foot to her exams. In the course of the hearing Home Office officials contacted by phone agreed to immediately transfer a payment of £14.50 a week into the teenager’s account so she can pay for food and also travel to her exams. Benjamin Douglas-Jones QC, sitting as a deputy high court judge, said: “This particular claimant has endured a lot, particularly with the Hemel Hempstead fiasco.” He said that the way the teenager was moved around between two of the different accommodation sites “should not have happened”. The teenager’s solicitor – Jamie Bell, of Duncan Lewis solicitors – said: “It is truly absurd how hard our 18-year-old client has had to fight just to access the basic rights of education. We are delighted that she should now have the opportunity to take her GCSEs after her case had to be considered by four judges.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “Despite dealing with unprecedented pressures on the asylum system, we continue to provide safe, comfortable and secure accommodation for asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute. “Asylum accommodation is offered on a no-choice basis and we always aim to keep asylum seeker moves to a minimum. There are occasions however where such moves are necessary but, in such instances, asylum seekers are always given sufficient notice ahead of their move.”",News/UK news,Home Office backs down over travel costs for Eritrean refugee sitting GCSEs,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/10/home-office-backs-down-over-travel-costs-for-eritrean-refugee-sitting-gcses
5/11/2022,"Rebekah Vardy has said she deeply regrets making unflattering personal remarks about Peter Andre in a newspaper interview, as the multimillion pound “Wagatha Christie” libel trial against Coleen Rooney got under way at the high court. The trial between the two footballer’s wives is taking place in a wood-panelled Victorian-era courtroom in central London that has heard many important cases over the years – but this could be the first where physiological matters were discussed at such length. With the leaking of private information at the heart of the much-anticipated case, David Sherborne, acting for Coleen Rooney, asked Vardy whether she was the sort of person who leaked stories to the media. After Vardy said she was not, the lawyer began reading out excerpts from a 2004 interview Vardy once gave to the News of the World about a one-night stand she supposedly had with singer and entertainer Peter Andre. Sherborne quoted Vardy’s words from the interview: “Peter’s hung like a small chipolata … the smallest trouser equipment I’ve ever seen.” After Vardy confirmed she did not seek Andre’s permission to reveal this personal detail in a national newspaper, the barrister asked: “Did you feel particularly strongly about the size of his manhood that it should be made public?” Vardy insisted she “deeply regrets” the incident and was coerced into giving the interview to the tabloid against her will by her ex-husband, an allegation the ex-husband has previously denied. The week-long trial pits the two wives of former England footballers – known as Wags – against each other. In 2019, Rooney conducted an elaborate sting operation to find out who was leaking stories from her private Instagram account to journalists at the Sun, ultimately making the public accusation that: “It’s………… Rebekah Vardy’s account.” Vardy is now suing Rooney for libel, arguing that the accusation was false. After an earlier ruling, it is up to Rooney to prove Vardy was personally responsible for leaking stories to the Sun – or to convince the judge that publication of the allegation was in the public interest. Rooney and her husband, Wayne Rooney, looked on intently as Vardy gave evidence on Tuesday afternoon. Rooney’s lawyers accepted they do not have a smoking gun that shows Vardy – the wife of the Leicester City player Jamie Vardy – actively leaking stories from Rooney’s private Instagram account to the Sun. However, Sherborne told the court this did not matter due to the weight of circumstantial evidence against Vardy. “In essence this is a detective story,” he said. “Like any good detective story, you never find the person responsible standing over the body with the smoking gun in hand … There’s inference, circumstance, probability and likelihood and ultimately they all add up – so the finger will point to the right suspect or suspects.” In written submissions, Vardy’s barrister, Hugh Tomlinson QC, denied his client had personally leaked any stories to the Sun, nor had she approved or condoned “anyone else to do so on her behalf”. However, the court did hear Vardy has recently realised her former agent and close friend, Caroline Watt, may have briefed stories to the tabloid without her knowledge. Tomlinson said the “candid” WhatsApp messages previously heard in court between Vardy and Watt showed that “from time to time they did discuss ‘leaking’ information to the press”. But only one story – a drink-driving incident involving the Chelsea footballer Danny Drinkwater – was mentioned. As a result, Rooney simply “can’t establish that Mrs Vardy was responsible” for the leaks, Tomlinson told the court. He said that although the “Wagatha Christie” case was being treated as a form of entertainment by much of the media, his client had been “subjected to abuse and threats of a horrific nature” as a result of Rooney’s allegedly false accusation. Rooney’s legal team argue that Vardy and Watt made a concerted effort to destroy evidence, with a litany of technological accidents affecting the retrieval of WhatsApp messages. In one incident, Sheborne highlighted how a “poor unfortunate phone” belonging to Watt was accidentally dropped off the side of a boat in the North Sea off the coast of Scotland within “days” of a legal request to search it. In written submissions, Rooney’s lawyers said these were not a series of “unfortunate” incidents. Instead, they claimed the loss of data was part of a “deliberate and calculated” campaign by Vardy and her team to dispose of potentially incriminating evidence – and prevent a fair trial. Sherborne said it did not make a difference if it was Vardy’s agent who leaked stories to the Sun on behalf of the footballer’s wife: “It’s like hiring a hitman or woman … just because you’re not the person who gets their hands dirty doesn’t mean you’re not equally responsible.” He concluded his opening remarks by suggesting the entire case against his client – and the millions of pounds spend on years of legal proceedings – was a pointless endeavour: “This whole court might just think: ‘Why on earth are we here?’” The case continues.",News/UK news,‘Wagatha Christie’: Vardy ‘deeply regrets’ intimate Peter Andre remarks,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/10/wagatha-christie-vardy-deeply-regrets-intimate-peter-andre-remarks
5/11/2022,"The head of the World Health Organization has voiced concerns over China’s effort to eliminate the Covid virus, in a rare rebuke to Xi Jinping’s pledge to achieve “dynamic zero-Covid”. The WHO’s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told a media briefing on Tuesday that his organisation does not think China’s Covid policy is “sustainable considering the behaviour of the virus”. “We have discussed about this issue with Chinese experts and we indicated that the approach will not be sustainable … I think a shift would be very important,” he said. Mike Ryan, the WHO’s emergencies director, added that the impact of a “zero Covid” policy on human rights needed to be taken into consideration alongside its economic effect. “We need to balance the control measures against the impact on society, the impact they have on the economy, and that’s not always an easy calibration,” he said. Ryan also noted that China has registered 15,000 deaths since the virus first emerged in the city of Wuhan in late 2019 – a relatively low number compared with 1 million in the US and more than 500,000 in India. With that in mind, it is understandable, Ryan said, that one of the world’s most populous countries would want to take tough measures to curb coronavirus contagion. However, he said the continued outbreaks have also underscored the difficulty of stopping the spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant. Scores of Chinese cities – from the financial hub Shanghai to the capital, Beijing – have been under some form of lockdowns since earlier this year. Shanghai is in its sixth week of lockdown, with the authorities’ heavy-handed enforcement of the policy causing anguish and anger. Despite the criticism, Xi last week reiterated that his government had no intention of changing course. The president urged officials to “unswervingly adhere to the general policy of dynamic zero-Covid” and warned against any criticism or doubting of the policy. Experts say China is in a dilemma over how to handle Covid. On Tuesday, new modelling by scientists in China and the US showed that the country risks more than 1.5 million Covid deaths if it drops its current policy without any safeguards, such as ramping up vaccination and access to treatments. The researchers said such a death toll could be much reduced if there was a focus on vaccination – only about 50% of over-80s in China are vaccinated – as well as providing antivirals while maintaining some restrictions.

5/11/2022,"Police in Bristol are treating an incident in which a white woman hit a 12-year-old black boy on the forehead with paddle as racially motivated after initially deciding not to prosecute. A review, overseen by a senior officer, has been launched into the attack, which left Antwon Forrest, who is autistic, needing hospital treatment for a deep cut. Avon and Somerset police have apologised for how they handled the case. There was an outcry after Antwon’s family published images of the boy’s injury and video of the woman, who works for a luxury car company, confronting him and other children at a riverside park. The woman was arrested, but three weeks later an officer told the boy’s family that no further action was being taken because the alleged attacker said she had acted in self-defence and felt “threatened”. Antwon’s family said they believe the incident could have been a hate crime because the woman appeared to have clashed with him rather than any of the white friends he was with. On Tuesday the force said it was treating the incident as racially motivated and appealed for more witnesses. The Bristol commander, Supt Mark Runacres, another senior officer, Ch Insp Mike Buck, and a community leader have met the boy’s father. Buck said: “We have complete empathy with his family and listened carefully to what he had to say. We gave a full commitment to carrying out a comprehensive review. We’ve re-classified this incident as being racially motivated and we have a detective sergeant leading the review, with oversight from a senior officer. “The review will include identifying and taking statements from as many people who witnessed this incident as possible, locating and viewing all available footage, re-examining 999 calls, compiling medical evidence and liaising with relevant partner agencies. “There will be learnings coming out of this. We’ve already identified the family should have been offered a right to review following the initial decision not to take any further action, and we have said sorry for that.” The boy’s father, Tyran Forrest, who is mixed race, said on Friday: “If it was me that had hit a white child, I would be in jail right now.” Forrest claimed some of the children – but not Antwon – were throwing mudballs at passing boats, including one being paddled by the woman. What followed allegedly involved some pushing and shouting and ended up with Antwon being struck by the woman with a paddle. Antwon’s cut was so deep it had to be glued together.

5/11/2022,"Theresa May has warned Boris Johnson that tearing up parts of the Northern Ireland protocol could harm Britain’s reputation for abiding by international law, as the UK and EU remained at a standstill in negotiations. The former prime minister made her intervention as Johnson and Liz Truss, his foreign secretary, were considering whether to unilaterally suspend parts of the protocol – the controversial post-Brexit regulatory framework that aligns Northern Ireland more closely with the EU than the rest of the UK. Speaking in the Commons, May told them they needed to consider the “wider sense of what such a move would say about the United Kingdom and its willingness to abide by treaties which it has signed”. But Johnson warned Micheál Martin, the Irish prime minister, on Tuesday that the situation was “now very serious”, suggesting that the UK may take its own steps to ignore parts of the protocol that have created trade barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. “The prime minister reiterated that the UK government would take action to protect peace and political stability in Northern Ireland if solutions could not be found,” Martin said. A No 10 spokesperson insisted “no decisions have been taken”, and added: “We want to fix some of the underlying challenges, and think the situation is extremely serious.” Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, has been in talks with the major parties in Northern Ireland since Sinn Féin became the biggest party on the assembly for the first time. The Democratic Unionists were pushed into second place and are refusing to resume power sharing without changes to the protocol. Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, told the Commons on Tuesday that there was “no consensus” in Northern Ireland for the protocol, and it was harming the economy. He added on Twitter: “Spoke to the prime minister this morning and reiterated our position that we cannot nominate to an executive until decisive action is taken on the protocol.” However, at the same time, the European Union executive ruled out any renegotiation of the protocol, responding to reports that Truss was planning to ditch the agreement. In a statement after the Queen’s speech, Maroš Šefčovič, the European Commission vice-president responsible for post-Brexit relations, said: “From the very beginning, the EU has worked tirelessly to propose creative and durable solutions, showing flexibility on how the protocol should be implemented. “The protocol, as a cornerstone of the withdrawal agreement, is an international agreement. Its renegotiation is not an option. The European Union is united in this position.” One EU official said it was expected that Johnson’s government would keep tapping into Brexit outrage, adding: “There might be a respect with what both sides are doing in Ukraine, but trust is irredeemably broken with this government.” Michelle O’Neill, the Sinn Féin vice-president, also insisted the protocol was “here to stay”. “I did speak to Boris Johnson and I made it very clear to him that his pandering to the DUP and the dialling up of rhetoric serves no purpose to provide the certainty and stability that people here want to see. This action of the British government today in cahoots with the DUP punishes the people here,” she said. Donaldson told reporters in London that he was committed to leading the DUP into political institutions at Stormont. But he added: “I’m also very clear we need to resolve the issues here in terms of the protocol and I will be making my position clear on that before the end of this week.” Asked if he would stay on as an MP or take up his mandate to be a member of the legislative assembly, Donaldson said: “In the short term a choice has to be made on that. I will come to a decision with my colleagues.”",News/UK news,"UK risks reputation if it breaches Northern Ireland protocol, warns May",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/10/uk-risks-reputation-if-it-breaches-northern-ireland-protocol-warns-may

A woman had accused Batali of forcibly kissing and groping her while taking a selfie at a restaurant in 2017.

5/11/2022,"Why did Ferdinand Marcos Jr win the Philippines election? The Marcos family has spent years rebranding its image, falsely portraying the authoritarian rule of Marcos Sr in which billions were plundered as a golden era and downplaying past atrocities. Researchers have described an onslaught of disinformation designed to revise history, enhance the reputation of the Marcoses and undermine their opponents. Many voters are not old enough to remember Marcos’ rule, which ended in 1986, and academics warn that the period is not taught thoroughly in schools, creating a vulnerability the Marcoses and their backers have exploited. Many supporters say they do not believe the family has plundered state money, despite numerous court rulings. Some analysts say a Marcos election is a continuation of a populist wave that started with president Rodrigo Duterte and reflects frustration with previous administrations’ failure to provide sufficient, tangible reforms following the People Power Revolution that ousted Marcos Sr. Is Marcos an ally of Duterte? Duterte did not officially endorse Marcos as a presidential candidate, nor has he always been complimentary. Last year, Duterte called Marcos Jr a “spoiled child” and “weak leader”, even as Marcos was campaigning on a joint ticket with his daughter. In a separate speech, he claimed a presidential candidate who had a prominent father, a thinly veiled reference to Marcos, was a cocaine user. During his presidency, however, Duterte has enabled the rehabilitation of the Marcos name, including by recommending Marcos Sr be given a hero’s burial with military honours in 2016. “The propagation of the myth of a golden age under the Marcos dictatorship played to his advantage while he was president,” said Sol Iglesias, assistant professor of political science at the University of the Philippines, who said such narratives were aligned with his own strongman leadership. “But upon stepping down, his main interest would be avoiding accountability,” she added. Duterte’s more recent jibes at Marcos may stem from an irritation that his daughter was running for the vice-presidency, and not the top job. Whoever is president will need to decide whether or not to cooperate with the international criminal court, which has launched an investigation into Duterte’s so-called war on drugs. Who is Sara Duterte? Sara Duterte, 43, first attracted national attention a decade ago, when she punched a local sheriff four times in the head, in front of a crowd of reporters. She was then mayor of Davao City, on the southern island of Mindanao, where the family is extremely powerful. She has previously swapped places with her father as mayor of Davao, and she held the role until earlier this year.A motorbike lover, she has the same tough style as her father. However, her rhetoric is less crude and extreme (he has called the pope a “son of a whore”, joked about rape, and once appeared to compare himself to Hitler). Many had anticipated that she would run for the presidency, and last year posters appeared across the country with the words: “Run, Sara, run”. Running in tandem with Marcos brought together two of the Philippines’ most powerful political families, and united their support bases in the north and south of the country. Their partnership reflects not just mutual preservation of their two families, but of the broader system of political dynasties that dominate politics in the Philippines, said Iglesias, who referred to reports their partnership was brokered by the former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. “If she hadn’t brokered this tandem, they might have run against each other, and that would have cannibalised their mutually reinforcing bases,” said Iglesias. In such a scenario, victory might have been within the grasp of someone like the vice-president Leni Robredo, a candidate who had promised reform, including an anti-dynasty law. What can we expect from the Marcos Jr presidency? If the results from the initial vote count are confirmed, Marcos Jr will have a huge mandate. However, his campaign was thin on policy detail, and so analysts say it is not clear how he will use this advantage. Marcos may seek to change the 1987 constitution, said Iglesias. For example, he may try to change a rule that bars presidents from seeking re-election at the end of a six-year term. Marcos will inherit a challenging economic situation, added Sonny Africa, executive director of IBON Foundation. “The last central bank data from the last quarter of 2021 showed that seven out of 10 families don’t have any savings at all, whether in the bank or under their mattress,” he said, while huge numbers of small businesses have collapsed. However, the Marcos camp did not provide an overview of how it would tackle these problems, he added. Marcos has said that he would only allow visitors from the international criminal court to enter the country as tourists, preventing its prosecutors from investigating Duterte’s war on drugs in the country. He is also expected to pursue closer ties with China, continuing the policy of the Duterte administration.",News/World news,Philippines election Q&A: why did Macros Jr win and what can we expect from his presidency?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/philippines-election-qa-why-did-macros-jr-win-and-what-can-we-expect-from-his-presidency
