2/24/2022,"Hello – Warren Murray introducing the news on a day we feared would come.  Russian forces have attacked Ukraine on the orders of Vladimir Putin, who announced what he called a “special military operation” at dawn. Explosions and airstrikes have been heard this morning near major Ukrainian cities, including the capital, Kyiv, and air raid sirens went off. Our correspondent Luke Harding reported earlier: “At least seven ‘powerful’ airstrikes on Vasilkovsky airport outside Kyiv, where Ukraine’s military fighter bombers are kept, Kyiv command says.” The Ukraine foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, confirmed what he called the “full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes.” In a bid to justify the invasion, Putin branded Ukraine an “anti-Russia … created on our historic lands” and claimed the campaign was for the “demilitarisation and denazification” of Russia’s neighbour – echoing a false theme of Kremlin propaganda that the Kyiv government is controlled by the far right. Joe Biden said: “The prayers of the entire world are with the people of Ukraine tonight as they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces. President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering.” Boris Johnson said: “I am appalled by the horrific events in Ukraine and I have spoken to President Zelenskiy to discuss next steps. President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine. The UK and our allies will respond decisively.” Here’s what we know so far about the Russian invasion. Make sure you keep up with the rapid developments in Ukraine at our live blog. As Putin was speaking and the first detonations were reported, the UN security council was holding an emergency session, chaired by Russia itself, which holds the rotating presidency, and at which the Russian and Ukrainian representatives traded barbs. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, earlier put out an address appealing directly to the Russian people to “listen to the voice of reason”. Russia’s leadership, he said, was “telling you that this flame will liberate the people of Ukraine, but the Ukrainian people are free”. He warned: “If someone attempts to take away our land, our freedom, our lives, the lives of our children, we will defend ourselves. By attacking, you will see our faces, not our backs, but our faces.” With international condemnation growing, Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, the commanders-in-chief of the Russian air force and Black Sea fleet, leading state “propagandists” and 351 Duma deputies are expected to be identified in EU sanctions that go further than the US, and further still than Boris Johnson’s Russia sanctions. Larry Elliott thinks that targeting Putin’s regime economically has mixed prospects: “Putin has been actively seeking to insulate Russia from the west ever since the invasion of the Crimea in 2014 … [and] Russia has used the money from its oil and gas exports to build up substantial financial defences. Moscow is sitting on foreign currency reserves of about $500bn (£369bn) and, by international standards, has extremely low levels of national debt.” The latter has a bearing on sanctions that stop Russia issuing or trading its sovereign debt in London and New York: the amount of bonds Russia needs to sell is relatively small. Europe’s dependence on gas from Russia looms large in all of this, of course. According to calculations by the Institute of Energy Economics at the University of Cologne shared with the Guardian, current levels of gas held in European reserves “could compensate for a loss of Russian deliveries” over the next six weeks unless temperatures were to drop dramatically in February or March. The US and other countries have said they are ready to step in with supplies of gas if Russia cuts Europe off. Another 10 years of debt – Students in England will have to continue paying back university loans over 40 years instead of 30. The number of graduates repaying in full is expected to double from under a quarter to more than half. They will face repayments sooner as the government cuts the wage threshold from £27,295 to £25,000 for new borrowers from September 2023. Martin Lewis, the founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, said: “It’s effectively a lifelong graduate tax for most.” Larissa Kennedy, president of the UK National Union of Students, said ministers were “saddling young people with unimaginable debt for the next 40 years of their lives”. In a concession, interest rates on student loans will be slashed for new borrowers and set no higher than the rate of inflation from next year – but Labour’s shadow education secretary accused the government of delivering a stealth tax that hits those on low incomes hardest. The government is also launching consultations on introducing minimum eligibility requirements to access student loans; and a lifelong loan entitlement for the equivalent of four years of post-18 education. Meat and cancer – Vegetarians have a 14% lower chance of developing cancer than meat eaters, according to a large study by Oxford researchers. Compared with people who eat meat more than five times a week, those who consumed small amounts had a 2% lower risk of cancer. The authors made clear that their findings did not conclusively prove regular meat-eating increased the risk of cancer. Smoking and body fat could also help explain the differences found, they said. Low meat eaters in the study had a 9% lower risk of developing bowel cancer than regular meat eaters. Vegetarian women were 18% less likely than those who ate meat regularly to develop postmenopausal breast cancer, though that may be due to their lower body mass index. Vegetarian men had a 31% lower risk of prostate cancer, while among males who still ate fish it was 20% lower. Starmer v Sunak – Keir Starmer will today pledge to “reimagine the role of government” as a partner to the private sector and take advantage of the opportunities of Brexit. Speaking in Huddersfield, the Labour leader will promise to value private companies as a partner to the state, and lay into Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives for “increasing taxes more than any other chancellor in half a century”. Labour’s strategy is for Starmer to drill issues such as tax and the cost of living to inflame Tory divisions and put Sunak in the spotlight given his ambitions to succeed Johnson as leader. Sunak will be delivering the annual Mais lecture at Bayes business school, in which he will say he wants to cut taxes “sustainably” and downgrade the role of the state as an engine of growth – aiming to quell concern among Tory backbenchers about the tax burden rising to its highest level in 70 years. Ikea but it’s Lidl – Today, Ikea’s £170m experiment on the former Kings Mall in Hammersmith will be tested with the opening of Livat, its first city centre shopping mall globally and the first to be refurbished rather than built from scratch. Ikea has 47 other shopping centres worldwide, but Livat is just over a third of the size of its typical site, and its first in the UK. It houses Ikea’s only high street store in the UK, a quarter the size of a typical store, as well as a Lidl, a Library of Things, and Sook, a rent-by-the hour retail or events space. Today marks the first day in nearly two years that no laws will be in place in England to deal with the spread of Covid-19. But is the government still following the science?

Ralf Rangnick admitted Manchester United’s plan was in the “dustbin” after Atlético Madrid scored on seven minutes before Anthony Elanga’s second half equaliser snatched a draw for the interim manager’s team in the Champions League last-16 first leg. Antonio Conte has questioned whether he is the right manager to turn Tottenham’s fortunes around after Burnley inflicted their fourth defeat in five games. England manager Sarina Wiegman said her side have taken “lots of information” from their 3-1 victory against Germany and inaugural Arnold Clark Cup win but will not get carried away before the European Championship in the summer. In the Premier League, Liverpool hammered Leeds 6-0 at Anfield, with two goals each for Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané and one apiece for Joël Matip and Virgil van Dijk.

And Lewis Hamilton has accused Formula One stewards of potential bias towards specific drivers and teams as old wounds were reopened on the first day of pre-season testing in Barcelona on Wednesday. Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine has wreaked havoc on already-wobbly financial markets this morning with shares falling precipitously in Asia Pacific overnight. Hong Kong was the worst hit, down more than 3%, and the FTSE100 is set to shed around 2.5% at the opening bell. Brent crude soared past $100 a barrel in a sign of increasing nerves about the impact on supplies, the Russian rouble hit a record low and the Moscow stock exchange suspended trading on all markets. The US dollar strengthened on all the uncertainty and left the pound at $1.349 and €1.201. The print editions were slightly overtaken by events today. The Guardian’s splash is “State of emergency in Ukraine as US warns Putin ready to invade”. “Welcome to hell” – the Mirror says that is the “warning from Ukraine” to Russian soldiers if they invade. But the Express says Putin is “Hell-bent” and has “gone full tonto” – the latter having been said by the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, and the former by Liz Truss, the foreign secretary. Wallace clearly had the better line: “Putin’s gone ‘full tonto’” is the Metro’s page one headline. The Financial Times says “Brussels hits Putin’s inner circle as US hardens invasion warning”. The i has a front-page Ukraine picture overlaid with “State of emergency declared as nation feels ‘knot of fear’”. Its splash though is “Students to face ‘lifelong graduate tax’”, the same story that leads the Times: “Students set to shoulder £100k bill for degrees”. “Sunak vows to slash tax burden” says the Telegraph, while at this moment the Mail is most worried about Britain’s spies being told, as it puts in its own words, to “go woke” by an internal guide to diversity and inclusion. The Sun says mock royal jewels from TV show The Crown have been stolen. The Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.

2/24/2022,"Western leaders have responded with fury to Russia launching military attacks on Ukrainian cities, and vowed to hold the Kremlin accountable with strengthened sanctions and other measures. Shortly after reports of explosions near Kyiv broke, US president Joe Biden accused Russian president Vladimir Putin of choosing a “premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering”.  “The prayers of the world are with the people of Ukraine tonight as they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces,” he said. “Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way,” Biden said. “The world will hold Russia accountable.” Biden said he had spoken to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on the phone shortly after the attacks began, and said that he had told him he and allied partners would be “imposing severe sanctions on Russia” once the G7 leaders had met on Thursday. “We will continue to provide support and assistance to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.” UK prime minister Boris Johnson said on Twitter he was “appalled by the horrific events in Ukraine” and had also spoken to Zelenskyy “to discuss next steps”. “President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine.” “The UK and our allies will respond decisively,” Johnson said. Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, presidents of the European Commission and Council, issued a joint statement: “We condemn in the strongest possible terms Russia’s unprecedented military aggression against Ukraine. By its unprovoked and unjustified military actions, Russia is grossly violating international law and undermining European and global security and stability. We call on Russia to immediately cease the hostilities, withdraw its military from Ukraine and fully respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence. Such use of force and coercion has no place in the 21st century.” EU leaders will meet in Brussels later on Thursday to discuss further sanctions against Russia. We strongly condemn Russia´s unjustified attack on Ukraine.In these dark hours, our thoughts are with Ukraine and the innocent women, men and children as they face this unprovoked attack and fear for their lives.We will hold the Kremlin accountable. Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Russia’s actions constituted “a grave breach of international law and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security”. “I strongly condemn Russia’s reckless attack on Ukraine, which puts at risk countless civilian lives,” Stoltenberg said. He said allies would now “meet to address Russia’s renewed aggression”. United Nations secretary general António Guterres, who had urged Putin just before the attacks began to stop his troops from doing so, tweeted an updated plea. “Under the present circumstances, I must change my appeal: President Putin, in the name of humanity, bring your troops back to Russia,” he said. “This conflict must stop now,” Guterres said.",News/World news,Western leaders decry Vladimir Putin as Russia launches attacks on Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/western-leaders-decry-vladimir-putin-as-russia-launches-attacks-on-ukraine
2/24/2022,"The Syria crisis continues unnoticed. It holds key lessons for the west about Putin yet it has gone virtually unnoticed by the rest of the world. War crimes and crimes against humanity continue in the Russian-sponsored dictatorship, even as some misguided leaders want to usher Bashar al-Assad, the architect of these crimes, back into acceptable society. We can rest assured that the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, unlike Assad, is not welcoming Putin with open arms. But in responding to the Ukraine emergency, there are lessons the west can and should learn from the situation in Syria.  Since the UN removed Syria’s declared chemical weapons stockpile in 2014, Assad has continued to bomb hospitals and schools, and burn villages to the ground in a macabre, medieval-style scorched-earth policy. Mercifully, we have not seen chemical weapons used since April 2019, but Syria today is a Russian state in all but name, and Assad a puppet dictator with strings very clearly tugged from Moscow. Idlib, a province in northwest Syria, is the only region still free of the tyranny, but with millions of malnourished souls trapped there, and Assad throwing in incendiary devices to smoke them out as you would vermin, it still resembles hell on earth. Even the UN has turned its back on Idlib, giving aid to Assad and his wife to distribute as they see fit. Syria now represents a major Russian and Iranian presence on the edge of Europe; and if Ukraine also falls, the balance of power will very much shift eastwards. With too many European countries reliant on Russian gas, the current global instability began in Damascus. An emboldened Russia buoyed up by high oil prices seems much more willing to face off with Nato than it did a few years ago, when its antiquated military was no match for western tanks. While the rest of us have cut our militaries to the bone, relying on electronics and space to fight the next war, Russia has modernised its armoured might, now on show around Ukraine – there is a unique quality in mass and heavy armour, which no cyberwarrior is going to vaporise. Syria shows what happens when you turn a blind eye and are too heavily influenced by peaceniks. Those of us involved in interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past 30 years have our issues with overstepping the mark in those places, but we look at Syria and know we should have done better. That knowledge should inform our response to Putin’s aggression now. It is clear when discussing Syria with Syrians from Idlib and regime-held areas that everybody has suffered. At least those in Idlib are getting support through Turkey, and there are some innovative projects being funded by European countries. Many hospitals and clinics in Idlib now have solar power to run their generators and surgical theatres, as there is no fuel and the power network was destroyed years ago. There is an electric car, also powered by solar energy, distributing medicines and Covid vaccines – when they are occasionally available – around Idlib. In a remarkable twist that would only happen in war, some of these Syrian medics who have developed a viable medical system under the most trying and demanding circumstances are now offering to help in Afghanistan. The Syrian people have shown resilience and innovation beyond compare, even as they have been let down again and again. First, the west did not intervene when the regime started attacking its own people. Then, in response to chemical weapon use, illegal under every rule of war, the US declared a red line on their use – but failed to act when that line was crossed. And finally, we stood by as Russia and Iran muscled their way across Syria to create a forward operation base on our doorstep. Our leaders will do well to remember this and be strong and resilient to protect Ukraine. I cannot think that a few sanctions on a few banks and billionaires is going to perturb Putin. He only understands strength and power – it’s time to show our steel.

2/24/2022,"Buildings that showcase Norwich’s Victorian industrial heritage, including a magnificent conservatory at the home of the family behind the Colman’s mustard brand, have been given special protection by the government. Among new listings, which were announced on Thursday, is the ornate conservatory at Carrow House. Built in 1895 by iron founders Boulton and Paul Ltd, the structure features rich patterns of ironwork, stained glass and mosaic, which have been remarkably well preserved, said Historic England, the body that manages the national heritage list for England.  The conservatory’s original ventilation and heating systems have been retained. It is listed at Grade II*. Carrow House, which was listed more than 30 years ago. was the family home of Jeremiah James Colman. His company, J & J Colman, moved to the nearby Carrow Works in the early 1850s, and Colman’s mustard, with its distinctive bright yellow label, was produced at the site for 160 years. The works were later bought by Unilever, and production ended in 2020. Trowse railway station is also newly listed at Grade II. Built in 1844-45, it was the terminus of the Norwich and Brandon line, which connected the city to London by rail for the first time. The station, at Bracondale, represented a “pivotal moment in railway and communications history”, said Historic England. Five months after it opened, a new swing bridge over the River Wensum allowed the line to continue to Norwich station. Trowse station, which is crafted from knapped flint, a traditional Norfolk building material, closed in 1939. Trowse sewage pumping station also gets Grade II listing. It was built about 1869 by Norwich corporation to improve sewage disposal caused by the growing industrialisation and population of the city in the 19th century. The engine house, which is built from red brick in an Italianate style, contains a grand spiral staircase and decorative embellishments. A replacement engine house built in 1909 has also been listed. Unusually for a utility building, it was constructed in a Renaissance style usually reserved for important civic buildings such as town halls, museums and libraries. Caroline Skinner, listing team leader at Historic England, said: “These remarkable heritage sites in east Norwich … can continue to tell an important story of a local industry that became a globally recognised brand, and the societal changes that took place in the town at this time.”",Arts/Culture,Buildings showcasing Norwich’s industrial past get protected status,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/24/buildings-showcasing-norwich-colmans-mustard-industrial-past-get-protected-status
2/24/2022,"The list of the worst disasters that have befallen Great Britain is topped by the Black Death of 1347-50 when about 3.5 million died. The current Covid pandemic is placed sixth, behind the 1557 influenza outbreak, which claimed 200,000 lives. The highest placed weather-related death toll is the great storm of 1703 when 8,000 were killed. Hurricane-force winds sank dozens of ships in the Channel and North Sea including a number of Royal Navy warships. Some vessels that did survive were driven hundreds of miles north and west before the sailors could regain control of their vessels.  There was loss of life on land too. People as well as thousands of farm animals drowned in extensive flooding in the West Country, and a large number of people were killed by falling trees, flying debris and chimney stacks falling through roofs. It is hard to compare the ferocity of that storm with Eunice last week although both battered the southern half of the country worst of all. There was one crucial difference. In 1703 the wooden sailing ships were caught unawares at sea and unable to reach safety, and the Somerset Levels flooded without prior warning. Last week many lives were protected by accurate weather forecasting and early warnings.",News/UK news,Weatherwatch: the huge loss of life from the great storm of 1703,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/24/weatherwatch-huge-loss-of-life-great-storm-of-1703
2/24/2022,"When their son was seven months old, strangers used to ask Kat West and Jaime Vallés if they fed him sedatives. “No, I don’t drug my baby!” West recalls with mock incredulity. “That was the weirdest question.” But it wasn’t: as Vallés reminds West, someone once asked if their son was animatronic. West and Vallés were subject to this line of questioning because, for about six months in 2019, their baby boy Rafael played Bobby Carney in The Ferryman. Bobby, as you might have gathered, is also a baby – the youngest character in the Olivier-winning Troubles drama by Jez Butterworth. For the show’s production team, and ultimately its audience, a real baby was miles better than a doll. “The live baby added to the verisimilitude of the production,” said Tim Hoare, associate director at the time. During its Broadway run, four different babies became Bobby, with Rafael playing him four times a week.  “Played”, of course, could be overstating things. Rafael’s role involved sitting in the dark and being passed around by the adults. But he is just one of a number of babies who have trodden the boards. The Book of Dust: La Belle Sauvage – running at the Bridge theatre in London – also features real babies, cast as tiny infant Lyra, the protagonist of Philip Pullman’s famous His Dark Materials fantasy series. These babies raise a number of questions. How, exactly, do you audition an infant? Can you train one? And aren’t there a million stinky, shouty ways it can go less than all right on the night? Just like adult actors, babies need agents. Bonnie Lia, founder of child talent agency Bonnie & Betty, says the last time they opened their books to babies, they received 1,300 applications, but could only represent 50. Who makes the cut? The aim is to get a wide range. “It would be pointless,” says Lia, “to have 20 Caucasian baby boys all aged three months with brown hair and brown eyes.” Then, when a casting call comes in, the team can put forward babies of the right race and age. “Generally,” Lia explains, “we try to match the baby to the actors playing the parents.” Then comes the audition – at which parents are placed under scrutiny, too. “They need to be flexible, committed, available at short notice,” Lia explains, “not too far from the location and laid-back with their baby possibly being handled by various cast and crew.” For modelling shoots and ads, sometimes babies are cast from photos or videos. But for theatre, directors need to see if a baby is prone to stage fright. “Our audition,” Vallés explains, “consisted of handing the baby over to the stage manager, him bringing the baby to the middle of the stage in darkness, and putting Rafael down on a mattress for 20 seconds with weird, spooky music playing.” The reason was simple – that’s how act two of The Ferryman began. Rafael was second in line and the baby ahead cried bitterly when left alone. “I looked at my son and said, ‘All right, kid, you’re never gonna have a better shot than this, because the person in front of you just blew it.’” West and Vallés responded to the casting call because both have experience in the arts – she’s a stage manager, while he works in video production. Rafael aced his audition. He stayed put on the mattress, didn’t cry at the bright lights, and wasn’t fussed when actors carried him around. By the time the production finished its run, West swears her son understood the concept of a cue light – the bulb that flashed when it was his time to go on. She says he never cried on stage once during his 48 performances. James Cousins, co-director on The Book of Dust, also auditioned babies by running them through scenes in the show and checking that both baby and parents were relaxed. Adiya Ijaha, one of the show’s four babies, received glowing reviews: she was cast because she was “amazingly chill” but also “really engaged with what’s going on”. The cast joke that she has learned the script. “We like to think she knows exactly what she’s doing,” says Cousins, “and has been on stage in a previous life.” Adiya had no real rehearsal time. The production didn’t involve the babies until the day before its first preview – before then, actors rehearsed with weighted dolls. When the babies finally arrived, they were taken through their five scenes over the course of two hours. Ultimately, the actors required more training than the infants – one of them had never held a baby before. For Cousins, casting a real baby was a no-brainer: “This show, ultimately, is about a baby.” However, a doll is swapped in for fight scenes and when the cast are rocked on a boat. While the baby is in five scenes, it has – unsurprisingly – no cues once on stage, although Adiya has on occasion let out a coincidentally well-timed giggle. Rafael was also in no way trained for his part: he was simply acclimatised to the stage and the actors. “They weren’t asking the baby to do anything,” Vallés explains. “It was the opposite: they wanted the baby to do nothing.” Sometimes, however, flukes meant that Rafael seemed trained. During the final scene on opening night, one actor asked another what the baby’s name was. “As soon as the actor said that, our son looked at the woman who was carrying him like, ‘What’s my name?’ And the audience died laughing because it looked like it was on cue.” In film and TV productions, babies do have to emote on command. Because it’s unethical to scare a baby into crying, sometimes the crew simply wait until a baby is hungry or needs its nappy changed. Then they film it having a wail. In The Book of Dust, Lyra never has to cry or laugh on demand, but sometimes a baby actor has timed the weeping well. In one scene, Lyra is picked up by the father who abandoned her. He holds her at arm’s length. “If she cries at that point,” says Cousins, “we let it happen, as long as she’s not bawling the house down.” However, if the baby cries when it shouldn’t, “the actors know the things they can cut out in order to get the baby off stage.” And if a Book of Dust baby is crying right before she’s due on stage, they just swap in the doll. So what about those tricky matters of child safeguarding? In The Ferryman, when Rafael was left alone on a mattress in darkness, two ushers stood on either side of the front row to ensure that no one in the audience leaned forward to snatch the baby. “Their only job,” says West, “was to stare at that baby until the baby got picked up by the actor, which was comforting.” The show started at 8pm every night, meaning West and Vallés wouldn’t get Rafael back home until after 11pm. “He would often pass out on the way,” says Vallés. “Then it would be harder to put him to sleep later – that part was rough.” Book of Dust babies, meanwhile, have a 10pm curfew. Lia explains that all children, no matter how young, require a performance licence issued by their local authority. In the UK, babies can get a licence at any age, even if they were born yesterday, although in California and many other US states, babies can only start acting when they’re 15 days old, and need a note from a doctor. In the UK, the licence stipulates how many hours the child can be on set and how many breaks it must be given. Babies are also paid: West and Vallés were legally required to put a percentage of Rafael’s earnings in a trust fund. Some of the remaining money was used to offset the cost of one of the parents having to be in the theatre four times a week. “He had to pay taxes when he was barely one year old,” West laughs. The family shared a dressing room with a standby baby and its parents. There was a one-hour break between its first entrance and its second, in which the parents would try to get their infant to nap. The standby baby had to be ready in costume in case Rafael had a bowel movement or started to wail. In fact, on his first ever performance, Rafael filled his nappy seconds before he was due on stage. Like a pro, he went on – although actors and front-row audience members might have preferred it if he hadn’t. Cousins jokes that baby Adiya has a better backstage setup than most of the cast. They share dressing rooms, while the baby actor has one of its own. “They can have whatever they want there,” Cousins says. Adiya particularly favoured a baby bouncer hung on the door. What, ultimately, is all this hard work for? Why not get an animatronic baby? “As soon as the baby is there,” Cousins says, “the energy on stage changes. The audience just lights up.” Baby Lyra is first brought on stage in a wheelbarrow: when she was revealed on opening night, the audience gasped. However, this excitement is not allowed to last too long. “Her moments on stage are kept quite short,” explains Cousins, “because the audience just stops listening to whatever’s going on.” The Book of Dust: La Belle Sauvage is at the Bridge theatre, London, until Saturday",Arts/Stage,"They have agents, do auditions and can still steal a scene after filling their nappies – meet the baby actors",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/24/baby-actors-nappies-ferryman-lyra-book-of-dust
2/24/2022,"The British government has not listened to victims in its efforts to tackle abuse in the humanitarian sector after the “sex for aid” scandals, a UK watchdog has said. The Independent Commission for Aid Impact (Icai) said the government was falling short because of a “top-down” approach and needed to listen and learn from recipients of aid who remained reluctant to report abuse allegations.  “The UK has played an important role in galvanising international action on protecting people from sexual exploitation and abuse in humanitarian crises,” said Icai’s commissioner Sir Hugh Bayley. “But its top-down approach requires those delivering UK aid to spend more time reporting back to the FCDO [Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office], than listening to the people they are seeking to protect and addressing their needs.” Britain’s initiative to tackle sexual exploitation in the aid sector was launched in 2018 after revelations that Oxfam employees sexually exploited victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. The government held an international safeguarding summit to tackle the problem. But the report found that abuse cases were still underreported. Icai said a survey in Uganda found people were hesitant to report cases to agencies because of long investigation processes, and concerns about corruption and not being believed. Mechanisms for dealing with complaints were often overwhelmed because they dealt with a broad range of safeguarding issues beyond sexual exploitation, Icai added. It said there were weaknesses internationally in sharing information about exploitation. However, the report said there had been progress in working with donors to promote a coordinated response within the humanitarian sector. Stephanie Draper, chief executive of Bond, a network of charities and NGOs in the UK, said the FCDO had “taken important steps” but progress was being held back by a lack of data “around incidents of sexual exploitation and abuse and what works where, and how to address and prevent it”. “Ultimately, the voices of victims and survivors need to be sought out and heard and this work needs to be adequately funded so organisations do not need to cut corners when it comes to safeguarding.” A spokesperson for the FCDO said the UK was a “world leader” in tackling sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment in the aid sector. “We continue to prioritise this work, protecting the most vulnerable and making sure money does not go to organisations that fall short of high safeguarding standards,” they said.",News/Global development,UK government accused of ignoring victims in efforts to tackle ‘sex for aid’,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/24/uk-government-accused-of-ignoring-victims-in-efforts-to-tackle-sex-for-aid
2/24/2022,"Gas prices are soaring globally, largely because of the resurgence of demand for fossil fuels after the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdowns, depleted storage and the difficulty of ramping up supply after the disruptions of the past two years. But prices have also been significantly affected by Russia’s recent decision to tighten gas supplies to Europe, which experts believe was driven by Vladimir Putin’s desire to move against Ukraine.  Europe is dependent on Russia for about 40% of its natural gas supplies, and despite the expansion of renewable energy over the past two decades, that dependency is increasing as countries shift to gas, away from dirtier coal. Germany is particularly vulnerable, as it has shut down nearly all of its nuclear power stations and aims to eliminate coal by 2030. A major new gas pipeline, Gazprom’s $11bn Nord Stream 2 from Russia across the Baltic to Germany, which would heat 26m German homes, has been the focus of Germany’s diplomatic relations with Russia since it was announced in 2015. Construction on the 1,200km pipeline was completed last year, but no gas has yet flowed and its future is now in doubt as Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz dramatically halted approval for the project on Tuesday. Concerns that Russia is using its gas supplies as a weapon to achieve its political aims are well founded. Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, noted that Russia’s decision to drop gas supplies to Europe by a quarter came as it was heightening tension towards Ukraine. “I hope this was only a coincidence,” he told the Guardian. No. Energy resources are not the focus of this threatened conflict. Vladimir Putin has a long history of territorial ambitions in former Soviet nations, which he made explicit this week, and of attempts to exert political control over Ukraine. Putin is said by supporters to be concerned over the possibility of Nato expansion, although many analysts say this is a pretext. So the Ukraine crisis is not a war over resources, but it has many implications for resource use. Russia is effectively weaponising its dominance over European gas supply for political ends. Reducing reliance on Russian gas is an urgent necessity for the EU to reach net zero emissions, and would also diminish Putin’s political leverage over the EU. It is also worth noting that in the longer term, as Europe weans itself off gas and pursues net zero emissions, the value of this political weapon will wane rapidly. Russia’s industries have never recovered from the fall of communism, and its economy is now based overwhelmingly on the export of fossil fuels, with much of the rest made up of energy-dependent mineral resources, such as iron, steel, aluminium and other metals, and some agriculture. Four in 10 roubles accruing to Russia’s federal budget pre-pandemic came from oil and gas, which made up 60% of Russian exports in 2019. Kremlin strategists are therefore keenly aware that in the longer term the global move to net zero threatens the whole basis of Russia’s economy and global influence. Historically, much of Europe was heavily dependent on coal for power and heating. Renewable energy generation has more than doubled since 2004, and reached 22% of final energy production in 2020. However, at the same time the share generated from nuclear power has fallen, from about a third of the EU’s electricity in 1995 to about a quarter today. After the accident at Japan’s Fukushima nuclear power plant in 2011, Germany’s then chancellor Angela Merkel announced an “Energiewende” – an energy shift – that would see all of the country’s reactors shut down. This has increased Germany’s need for gas, and similar moves away from coal and towards lower emissions in other countries – including the UK, which despite North Sea gas production is a net importer of gas – have heightened the dependency. The geopolitical implications of this dependency, as well as the climate impacts, are now unignorable. Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser, now with the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington DC, says: “It has taken the current crisis for Germany and the EU to recognise that its co-dependence on Russian gas is a geopolitical and climate nightmare from which they must finally awake. Reducing Russian gas reliance is a huge climate and moral imperative that Europe must prioritise.” That would be a momentous move from Russia. Any further reductions of Russian gas supply to Europe would have severe consequences, for Europe but also for Russia itself. Birol said earlier this month, before sanctions were imposed: “If Russia stops the gas supply to Europe, it could have a seismic impact on European energy. [Russia] has to consider the consequences if existing oil and gas supplies to Europe are halted.” He added: “Failure to maintain [supplies] would shatter Russia’s reputation as a reliable partner and that would be a tectonic shift. Russia would be seen as a threat and that would have far-reaching consequences for European economies, but even more consequences for Russia. Europe would choose a strategy to diverge from Russia.” Russia was almost invisible at the Cop26 UN climate summit in Glasgow last November, after a surprising public commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2060. But the Kremlin has left the details of the goal vague and shown little sign of updating Russia’s emissions commitments for 2030, which are key to limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C. This is a crucial year for climate diplomacy, as the pledges from all countries in Glasgow are still inadequate for the 1.5C goal, and the UK Cop26 presidency is hoping for major progress before the next UN climate meeting in Egypt this November. Russia’s stance on Ukraine will certainly have an impact on those discussions, not least as any conflict will focus attention on the move from fossil fuels. It is also notable that Russia’s oil and gas operations are among the worst in the world for the climate. Data released this week by the IEA shows that emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas and the major component of natural gas, are 70% higher than countries had claimed. Russia makes little or no attempt to capture methane from its oil and gas drilling, and to stop its pipelines leaking, so there are huge opportunities. If Putin were serious about tackling the climate crisis, Russia could provide an invaluable service to the rest of the world by plugging these leaks – reducing methane globally by a third by 2030 could reduce temperatures by 0.2C – and at current gas prices this could be done at no net cost and could even be profitable. No. Attempts to frack in the UK started more than a decade ago, but went nowhere, in part because of protests but also because the economics of industrial fracking in a densely populated country make it impractical. Any move to restart fracking now would take many years to produce any gas, long after the current gas price crisis has been forgotten. New licences for oil and gas exploration in the North Sea are also currently under consideration by the government, and on Thursday the Committee on Climate Change will publish its advice to ministers on whether these licences can be compatible with the UK’s climate goals. However, any newly licensed fields would also take years to come into production, so would have no impact on the current crisis. Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, warns of falling for false solutions: “We know that some opponents of climate policy will try to hide the truth and instead fool the public into falsely believing that the soaring prices are due to green energy. If they are successful, they might slow down the transition to clean domestic energy.” Far more good could be done in the shorter term by insulating homes and ramping up renewable energy generation. War in Ukraine could still be averted by diplomatic means, and the world may return to an uneasy truce in the region. But the energy angle should not be forgotten, for the leverage it has given Putin over EU democracies. Rachel Kyte, dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University in the US and an adviser to the UN secretary-general on the climate, says: “The west needs to meet Putin’s flagrant breach of international law with tough sanctions to force a change in calculus in Moscow. Putin believes he has to the largest extent sanction-proofed Russia, but Russia earns hundreds of millions of dollars a day from sales of oil and refined products, and more from sales of gas and minerals. “Weaning ourselves off these as quickly as possible is one route available to the west. In fact, Putin’s understanding of what decarbonisation would mean for Russian energy exports in the medium and long term may be a factor in the timing of Putin’s attack on Ukraine now.” Ending the use of fossil fuels is imperative, to reach net zero emissions and stave off the worst impacts of climate breakdown. But the shift will also create geopolitical tensions as the world’s massive fossil fuel exporters – Russia, Saudi Arabia and some other Middle Eastern countries, Latin American oil producers, Australia – begin to lose out economically. The crisis in Ukraine shows that some fossil fuel producers at least may not want to give up without a struggle the political leverage they gain from their resources.",News/World news,Q&A: could Putin use Russian gas supplies to hurt Europe?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/qa-could-putin-use-russian-gas-supplies-to-hurt-europe

2/24/2022,"Fifteen years ago a then 30-year-old Ashley Tabor-King sparked a British radio revolution striking the first of a series of deals totalling more than £600m that would ultimately create Europe’s biggest commercially funded group, owner of stations from Capital and Heart to LBC and Classic FM. Earlier this week, Tabor-King’s Global once again flexed its financial muscle by signing deals with BBC stars Emily Maitlis and Jon Sopel, who will join former colleague Andrew Marr at LBC, reportedly doubling their salaries in the process.  The move is classic Global: spend big to get bigger by exploiting opportunity in the market, backed by a seemingly unlimited reservoir of cash bankrolled by its controlling shareholder – Tabor-King’s father. In the mid-noughties Tabor-King – who had worked at Capital Radio in the 1990s before setting up a music company where he worked with acts including Corinne Bailey Rae and The Wanted – spied a looming sea change in British radio. The inexorable switch to digital radio would help level the playing field with the BBC, which had dominated with the prime FM and AM spectrum, while consolidation among commercial players would give the scale needed to compete and take advantage of a future iPhone, smart speaker and podcast generation of listening. “Daddy basically bought the company,” says one industry executive, referring to Tabor-King’s £375m deal to buy the owner of Capital Radio in 2008, then the biggest commercial operator in the UK. “That doesn’t mean their strategy isn’t sound and well-executed, but it definitely helps having deep pockets though.” Tabor-King, who changed his name on marrying his partner George King in 2019, is the son of Michael Tabor. Monaco-based Tabor has made a fortune estimated by the Sunday Times at more than £600m from a combination of investments in gambling, buying BetVictor in 2014, plus a string of thoroughbred racehorses. In 2007, Global made its first move buying Chrysalis Radio, home to Heart, Galaxy and LBC, for £170m. At the time the deal was reported to be backed by Tabor and wealthy Irish businessmen including John Magnier and JP McManus, his fellow partners in the Coolmore Stud racing stable. Former ITV chief executive Charles Allen, later Lord Allen of Kensington, assumed the role of chairman of Global, a position he still holds. Five years later a final major deal, a fiercely contested £70m bidding war for GMG Radio, then third-biggest player in the UK and part of the group that owns the Guardian, cemented Global’s place as the biggest commercial player in British radio. Global, which takes half the £700m spent on radio advertising annually in the UK, made £358m in revenues in the pre-pandemic year to the end of March 2020. While operating profits hit £60m, the business continues to make significant losses at a pre-tax level. This is in part due to a structure whereby Global, which is ultimately incorporated in Jersey, is financed by £1.7bn loans from the Tabor family and banks. “The group is primarily funded by debt and although both shareholder and bank loans have increased during the year, the group’s operations are cash generative,” the company said in its most recent annual financial filing to Companies House. This financial freedom has allowed Global to aggressively invest and grow through good times and bad, under the group chief executive, Stephen Miron, who joined from the publisher of the Daily Mail in 2008. Global has had the deep pockets to be able to strike a raft of deals to secure must-listen stars in recent years, including Kate Garraway, Amanda Holden, Moira Stuart, John Humphrys, Alexander Armstrong and Eddie Mair. Maitlis, who secured the famous Prince Andrew interview, will work alongside former North America editor Sopel to front the new podcast for Global Player and host a radio show together on LBC. They will work with Dino Sofos, the founder and chief executive of the audio production company Persephonica, a former head of BBC news podcasts and the creator of Brexitcast, Newscast and Americast. With 18 brands, including a growing number of extensions from Capital Dance and Smooth Country to Heart 80s, Global is able to commercialise 26m weekly listeners which account for 24% of all radio listening. While the pandemic fuelled a precipitous decline in revenues as commuting by car ground to a halt, a key commercial radio audience, the industry bounced back rapidly as listening to radio and podcasts at home boomed. Online listening, including via smart speakers, now accounts for 17% of all listening time. Digital listening, including DAB radio, represents 65% of all radio listening. By the first quarter of last year, which proved to be the biggest ever for annual radio revenues at £718m according to the Radiocentre, Global’s radio operation saw revenues climb 3% over pre-pandemic levels. The company does not reveal details of the performance of podcasts, but points to significant success with originals including John Sweeney’s Hunting Ghislaine, Rachel Johnson’s Difficult Women and Vogue Williams’ My Therapist Ghosted Me. “Younger adults, especially the under-24s, are listening to much less radio overall than previously, and the sector will find it difficult to draw these people in as they get older,” says Gill Hind, a director at Enders Analysis. “Hence their investments in podcasts and streaming services.” Four years ago Global made another audacious move to diversify and strengthen its overall media business by striking a number of deals for outdoor advertising companies including Exterion, which runs the £1.1bn contract for Transport for London including London Underground, the biggest of its kind in the world. The sector was one of the worst-hit during the pandemic as cities effectively shut down but it is recovering rapidly, giving Global more than a third share of a £1bn-plus UK outdoor advertising market, and boosting the company’s overall annual revenues well over £700m. While the BBC faces having to find as much as £2bn in savings over the next six years as the government squeezes licence-fee income, occasional glimpses into the life of low-profile Tabor-King gives a stark insight into the differing financial fortunes the two radio giants find themselves. As well as having held New Year’s Eve parties at the family’s Sunset Reef home in Barbados, reportedly attended in the past by Simon Cowell and Sir Philip Green, Tabor-King made headlines in 2017 when he was refused permission to knock together two flats in Knightsbridge to create a £200m penthouse flat. Still, Global’s 2,000 employees can take some solace that they weren’t forgotten when Tabor-King was awarded an OBE for services to the media industry the same year, when he tweeted: “This one is for everyone @global”.",News/Media,The rise of LBC’s owner Global and how it is now poaching BBC stars,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/24/the-rise-of-lbcs-owner-global-and-how-it-is-now-poaching-bbc-stars
2/24/2022,"Russian forces are attacking several locations across Ukraine. Here is what we know so far about the offensive: Vladimir Putin launched a broad Russian military offensive targeting Ukraine at around 5am on Thursday morning after broadcasting a speech announcing a “special military operation” to “demilitarise” and “deNazify” Ukraine.  According to Ukrainian officials the initial wave of strikes appeared to involve cruise missiles, artillery and airstrikes which struck military infrastructure and border positions. Explosions were heard in cities including Odessa, Mariupol, Kharkiv, Dnipro and the capital Kyiv. The full scope of the Russian military operation was not immediately clear but Putin said: “Our plans do not include the occupation of Ukrainian territories. We are not going to impose anything by force.” However Putin and Russian officials have also repeatedly denied planning a military assault on Ukraine. As explosions were heard around Kyiv, the city’s mayor ordered residents to take shelter and remain indoors as air sirens sounded. In the immediate aftermath of the first wave of strikes Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, announced martial law had been declared across the country. The Ifax news agency also described amphibious landings by troops in the south-west although this is so far unconfirmed. At around 7am – two hours into the assault – Russian backed separatist rebels were reported to be attacking Ukrainian positions around the self styled break away republics of Luhansk and Donetsk. There were also unconfirmed reports of Russian troops crossing the border near the city of Kharkiv. The Russian attack on Ukraine followed the declaration of a no-fly zone for civilian aircraft in the north-east of Ukraine via a so called Notam – notice to airmen – in the early hours of Thursday. A few hours later Ukrainian officials announced the suspension of internal civilian air traffic as it appeared that some Russian strikes were close to Kyiv’s main civil airport. However the Russian military said it had targeted Ukrainian airbases and other military assets, and had not targeted populated areas.",News/World news,Russia has invaded Ukraine: what we know so far,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/russia-has-invaded-ukraine-what-we-know-so-far
2/24/2022,"A Northern Territory sergeant who trained Constable Zachary Rolfe has described him in court as a senior member of a specialist response team and good marksman. Sgt Lee Bauwens also said in the NT supreme court on Thursday that Rolfe achieved perfect scores in shooting training, and had later assisted him in some training sessions.  Bauwens was giving evidence during Rolfe’s trial for murder. Rolfe is charged with murdering Kumanjayi Walker in Yuendumu, a remote community about 300km from Alice Springs, on 9 November 2019. The court has previously heard that Walker, a 19-year-old Warlpiri man, stabbed Rolfe while the officer was trying to arrest him. Rolfe then shot Walker three times. The murder charge relates to the second two shots, which the prosecution alleges were fired at close range while Walker was on the ground under the control of another officer, Adam Eberl. Rolfe has pleaded not guilty and defends his actions on the basis they were justified in light of the risk Walker posed to him and Eberl. The defence also disputes that Walker was under control at the time of the shots. On Wednesday, Bauwens gave evidence that he performed Rolfe’s induction training when he joined the immediate response team (IRT) in either late 2017 or early 2018. The court heard the team, which Bauwens led and helped create, is a squad of general duties officers who receive additional training that enables them to be deployed to support other police or cordon and contain high-risk events until specialist officers arrive. In continuing his evidence on Thursday, Bauwens described Rolfe as a senior member of the IRT. He said that a training record tendered in evidence to the court had shown Rolfe hit 15 out of 15 targets while using a primary weapon, which Bauwens said would have been an AR-15 rifle, and all six targets using his secondary weapon, a Glock semi-automatic handgun. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Bauwens was asked extensive questions by prosecutor Philip Strickland SC about the defensive tactics and cordon-and-contain training that Rolfe had received. Strickland told the court in opening his case that the context leading up to the shooting, including Rolfe’s training and the planning undertaken before the IRT travelled to Yuendumu, was relevant to the murder charge. David Edwardson QC, for Rolfe, also asked Bauwens about NT police training, including a manoeuvre Bauwens described as a “shove and shoot”. Bauwens said this was specifically taught to officers as training for how to respond when confronted with an edged weapon by an offender who was in close proximity, and it involved shoving or hitting the offender with one arm while using the other to draw the gun and fire at the offender. Under questioning from Edwardson, Bauwens agreed that all NT police were trained to only use force when necessary, and to only use force that was reasonable and proportionate to the threat. “In other words, if someone is brandishing a chopstick, you don’t pull out your gun, do you?” Edwardson said. “Not generally, no,” Bauwens responded. Edwardson then asked: “On the other hand, if they produced an edged weapon which is potentially lethal, then you’re told you’re entitled to deploy your weapon and you have to, if necessary, be prepared to pull the trigger?” “That’s correct,” Bauwens said. The trial continues.",News/Australia news,NT sergeant tells court Zachary Rolfe is an accurate marksman trained to contain high-risk events,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/24/nt-sergeant-tells-court-zachary-rolfe-is-an-accurate-marksman-trained-to-contain-high-risk-events
2/24/2022,"Scarlet elf-cups have opened. So much stranger and more animal than flowers of snowdrops and lesser celandines, these bloody, little, inside-out mushrooms of the fungus Sarcoscypha austriaca appear as envoys of a parallel season. They materialise at the end of winter, not as heralds of spring but of a perpetual autumn in the realm of rot. The storm-drama of wind and rain thrashing through trees above defines the day, but the elf-cups blooming in the quietly rotting debris of previous storms belong to a hardly noticeable world. The fungus feeds on fallen sticks in the damp, mossy shadows under trees. Its gauze of weaving filaments infiltrates cells of dead wood to digest the timber and return it to the soil.  The storm is rewilding. It owes much of its ferocity to our agency that creates climate chaos but, despite being branded with a human name, the storm is immune to attempts to domesticate it and is crushingly indifferent; it cares nothing for what we care about. It seeks out vulnerabilities in the architecture of trees, wrenching, twisting, jamming into fractures, bursting them open, breaking, uprooting, overturning – the macro equivalent of the micro workings of the fungus. Weather and fungi are in league with each other, a creative-destructive pact for the disintegration, decay and rejuvenation of the forest. The scarlet elf-cups carry their folklore lightly. They are brightly otherworldly and are left behind by elves, pixies, fairies and those populations of supernatural folk once commonplace in rural culture – now, even talking about them, the words seem so distantly extinct. Medicinal properties, culinary curiosity and scientific revelations keep fungi culturally in the exotically weird, a fifth column in the service of a more-than-human-worldliness. Perhaps instead of seeing the elf-cups as receptacles of myth, they may be thought of as sensory structures. Passing Jodrell Bank on the train, the radio telescopes seem to echo elf-cups on a massive scale. The great dishes listening to the sky, receiving signals from the galactic radio, are gross, dull versions of the tiny scarlet ears picking up the storm frequency, transmitting space capsule spores into the future, connecting a microscopic world to the void.
