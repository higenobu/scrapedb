12/26/2021,"Dale Weeks’ family believes he was an indirect victim of the COVID-19 pandemic. The retired Iowa school superintendent died in late November, nearly a month after he was diagnosed with sepsis, a dangerous, blood-borne infection unrelated to the coronavirus. His daughters think he might have survived if he’d been admitted immediately to a large medical center, where he could have received advanced testing and prompt surgery. But he stayed for 15 days at Newton’s relatively small hospital because the bigger facilities said they couldn’t spare a bed for him, his family says. Iowa’s short-staffed hospitals have been jammed for months with patients, including people severely sickened by COVID-19. “It’s infuriating that people who are not vaccinated are clogging it up,” said Jenifer Owenson of Des Moines, who is one of Weeks’ four children. Weeks lived in the southern Iowa town of Seymour. When he began feeling ill, he thought it might be a side effect of a flu shot and a booster shot of coronavirus vaccine. On the night of Nov. 1, he went to the hospital in nearby Centerville, where staff determined he had sepsis. “They told my dad and his wife right away they had no beds,” Owenson said. The staff called around for hours, seeking an open hospital bed. At first, the closest one they could find was in Illinois. Then, by midday the next day, they found a spot at the MercyOne hospital in Newton, 80 miles north of Centerville. He was taken there by ambulance. Owenson said the Newton hospital's staff did the best they could for her father, including giving him intravenous antibiotics. But when his infection failed to resolve, the family repeatedly asked if he could be transferred to a more advanced hospital. “We kept being told he was on a ‘list of degrees of severity,’ and his number had not come up,” she said. He was aware of the situation, she said. “He was extremely frustrated. He was like, ‘Why can’t something be done?’” On Nov. 17, after 15 days, he was taken to the University of Iowa Hospitals by ambulance. Doctors there determined on Nov. 25 that he needed surgery to clear out a severe infection of an artery near his stomach, where years earlier he’d had a stent installed to repair an aneurysm.

He needed to have this surgery, or he would die in a few days,” said Owenson's twin sister, Julia Simanski of Ankeny. The Nov. 26 surgery lasted 17 hours, but Weeks continued to struggle, his daughters said. A surgeon told the family it was one of the worst infections she’d ever seen, they said. A second, shorter operation didn’t reverse his decline. His kidneys and intestines were failing. He died Nov. 28 at age 78. Representatives of the hospitals declined to comment on Weeks’ case, but they acknowledged the frustration caused by hospital crowding. “In addition to an increased number of COVID-19 cases and spread of the delta and omicron variants, hospitals across the country are dealing with traumas and experiencing multiple types of illness,” MercyOne spokesperson Marcy Peterson wrote in an email to the Des Moines Register. “This demand is coupled with a reduced number of staff to care for patients. These challenges can strain available resources and contribute to delays in care or other complications for patients.” She noted that unvaccinated people make up a large percentage of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The Iowa Department of Public Health reported Wednesday that nearly 82% of people hospitalized in Iowa for COVID-19 were not fully vaccinated, including 88% of those in intensive care. Overall, 30% of Iowa adults are not fully vaccinated. Laura Shoemaker, a spokesperson for the University of Iowa Hospitals, said her facility is often close to full. “Even prior to the pandemic, it was not uncommon for us to operate at 90-95% capacity on average,” she wrote in an email to the Des Moines Register. “For perspective, we have 860 beds and as of today we have 780 inpatients. That number goes up and down continuously by the hour as patients are discharged and new patients are admitted.” She noted that to address such crowding, the University of Iowa recently gained approval to build an additional hospital in North Liberty.

He was a former math and science teacher and principal who served as schools superintendent in the Mingo, Woodward-Granger and Seymour districts before retiring in 2007. “He will be remembered by many as a kind, loyal, and humble person,” his family wrote in his obituary. “He could be counted on to offer help, say ‘yes’ to a request for a favor, and assume the best in others.” His family will never know whether the pandemic indirectly shortened his life. They understand he might have died even if he’d been admitted immediately to a large medical center. Still, Simanski said, “I think it would have given us a fairer chance.” Tony Leys covers health care for the Register. Reach him at tleys@registermedia.com or 515-284-8449.

12/26/2021,"Brandy Carlson has a lot to be nervous about. Her husband would have been released from his prison term at Hutchinson Correctional Facility in September if he had received good time credit, as the family expected, for his kidnapping sentence. But instead he is in limbo, with an expected release date of January 2023 looming in the distance. While the Kansas Department of Corrections reports no active inmate cases of COVID-19 at HCF, nine staff cases and a rising number of infections has increased Carlson's fears about her husband, who has a depressed immune system and already contracted hepatitis while in state custody. Meanwhile, the two have not seen each other in person since before the pandemic, with Carlson unable to drive the two-and-a-half-hours to Hutchinson for a brief visit behind Plexiglass. The family is in the middle of adopting a 9-year-old son. Michael calls Carlson's husband, Jimi Lee, ""Pops"" and looks forward to their three-times-a-week video calls but said he would rather see him in person. ""So he can fix my bike,"" he said. The family has two video calls already scheduled for Christmas Day so the family can have some semblance of normalcy on their first holiday together. ""They get along really well,"" Carlson said. ""I don't know who is more excited, truthfully. My husband ... is excited to be a father again."" That isn't all. An older family friend is housed in El Dorado Correctional Facility, which has been locked down due to a lack of staffing and a rising threat of COVID-19. And her son is incarcerated at Hutchinson due to a parole violation. ""I feel like they could do better than what they are,"" Carlson said of KDOC. Frustration is running high amid renewed concern about the situation in state prisons, both with respect to COVID-19 and perilously low staffing levels that have prompted modified operations in the state's two largest prisons. But the lockdowns are not being uniformly enforced, family members say, meaning an inmate's access to services and support varies based on their unit and location, leading to concern for those who are set to be released or eligible for parole in the near future. Meanwhile, frustration is running high for individuals who are staying in their cells for all but a half hour per day, leading to fears that low staffing levels and flaring tempers could continue to create safety risks for staff members and inmates alike. ""We don't have enough staff and it is dangerous, because the people are getting pissed off because they've been in cages for almost two years,"" said Brandilyn Parks, executive director of the Kansas Coalition for Prison and Sentencing Reform. ""I mean, it's definitely coming to a boiling point."" Lansing and El Dorado have been under staffing emergencies since the summer months, though the situation has worsened in recent months. Two correctional officers at Lansing have been attacked in the last six weeks, with staff shortages blamed for the incidents. Both staff members was hospitalized as a result of their injuries, the union representing state corrections officers said at the time. More: Corrections officer hospitalized after inmate attack at Lansing Correctional Facility The staffing shortage meant KDOC halted in-person visits at Lansing in November. ""The changes described here are not taken lightly, particularly given that the holiday season is upon us,"" KDOC Secretary Jeff Zmuda wrote in a letter to families dated Nov. 24. ""If there were other options, we would implement them, but there are not."" The policies, as well as increased lockdowns, restrictions on some services and other schedule changes, signal the prison is ""likely to remain in this operational status for an extended period of time,"" Zmuda wrote. But families and staff note the Lansing changes are not being consistently implemented. Business has continued as usual in most units at Lansing Correctional Facility — except the maximum security unit, said Audry Piert, who has a loved one incarcerated in the facility. Sarah LaFrenz, executive director of the Kansas Organization of State Employees, said the inconsistent nature of how the lockdowns were carried out at Lansing meant uncertainty for staff and inmates alike. ""I think they appear to just kind of define it as they go along like it which doesn't always seem to me to be a really good process,"" LaFrenz said. Piert said it was particularly frustrating, as at least one of the attacks had occurred in a medium security unit, yet KDOC has maintained locking down the maximum security area should be a top priority for safety purposes. ""Maybe they're given 20 minutes a day,"" Piert said of the inmates on the maximum security unit. ""And that's if they're lucky. KDOC is not following their own protocol. Whatever whim or whatever mood whatever person shows up for their shift that night, that's how it goes. As so this has become incredible volatile."" Randall Bowman, director of external affairs for KDOC, acknowledged in an email that ""modified operations currently in place do impact our residents differently."" But he added ""units where the risk to the safety of everyone are the greatest is in our maximum custody units,"" prompting tighter conditions there. ""If staffing levels require in the future, or on a given shift, those same modifications would be extended to other units,"" Bowman said. ""But providing call outs, programs, dayroom, yard, etc. for as many residents as available staffing will allow is the goal."" But the swift change on visitation was particularly brutal given that it came around the holidays, family said. Parks noted Lansing held a banquet for a faith-based program which aims to help with re-entry, which occurred in one of the cell blocks at Lansing — while families remain shut out. Bowman countered the event was allowed because it did not require the same ongoing staff investment as visitation. ""Families are, you know, gathered together having (Thanksgiving) dinner, and then you find out once again, that you're losing your visitation with your loved ones in prison, Piert said. ""That was pretty tacky."" At El Dorado Correctional Facility, modified operations have become the norm — restrictions have been in place there since early October. Brian Betts, an inmate at El Dorado, said the current state of affairs ""are worse than they've ever been during my 24 years of incarceration."" Betts is set to appear before the parole board in a year's time. But a lack of staff has left him unable to use a career center in the prison to polish his resume and begin preparing for a work search — elements that could strengthen his case for parole. Other inmates, he said, were due to be released soon, with no access to services to help them successfully re-enter society. ""We are being denied the opportunity to utilize the tools and resources that our tax dollars provide the prison and KDOC with to help prepare us to be productive when released and prevent us from returning to prison,"" Betts said. The modified lockdown even means access to the law library is restricted, with inmates forced to request materials for staff to bring to their cells. Sharon Brett, legal director for the ACLU of Kansas, noted the limitations, while well-intentioned, were ultimately not the answer. ""The solution to put a facility on lockdown and remove all programming and access to services and supports that people rely on to maintain their humanity and their dignity while they're incarcerated is not a solution to dealing with staffing shortages or the ongoing pandemic that we're not going to be out of anytime soon,"" Brett said. Meanwhile, the staffing shortages inside prisons appear unlikely to ease anytime soon. Workers are required to take on 12-hour shifts and work mandatory overtime. Families say they are sympathetic to the concerns from overworked staff but note the challenges date back to well before the pandemic. ""I don't think anybody would not agree that they definitely need to have the appropriate amount of staff,"" Piert said. ""But this didn't just happen. This has been a massive exodus for five, seven years. And the governors and the secretaries of corrections have just ignored this and allowed it to come to this."" The situation has prompted calls to bring in the Kansas National Guard to stabilize the situation. But the guard is limited in what it can do to aid in the COVID-19 response. Because there is no active statewide disaster declaration related to the pandemic after Republican lawmakers ended the emergency in May, ""the Kansas Guard can not be tasked without one,"" agency spokesperson Jane Welch said in an email. Even if the guard could be deployed, it is likely they would be limited in what duties they could perform. Guard members provided support at Lansing last year when the prison was the site of a massive COVID-19 outbreak but it was largely limited to medical and support duties, not taking on safety roles. Meanwhile, Gov. Laura Kelly's administration is hoping a proposed plan to give corrections staff both temporary pay hikes and bonuses as well as more permanent raises will help attract more workers. A panel of top lawmakers approved up to $30.3 million in federal aid for this purpose and it is likely legislators will be asked to use some of the state's expected budget surplus to make the changes permanent. ""These are the guys that are frontline and, for lack of a better term, deserve more competitive wages,"" said Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover,. Even if the pay raises help turn things around, however, LaFrenz estimated it would take three to six months to stabilize the situation. Bowman, of KDOC, said their human resources staff is incorporating the raises ""into their processes"" but noted they have not yet ""seen a noticeable impact"" on recruitment as of yet. Meanwhile, Brett argued increasing pay was diverting attention away from the real solution, which should be a meaningful conversation about shrinking the prison population. ""We have a platform that is about reducing mass incarceration and there's no component of raising staff salaries that gets towards that goal,"" she said. Instead, the ACLU was ""hopeful that there will be another round of"" clemency applications approved soon. In June, Kelly signed off on five commutations and three pardons, the most approved by any governor in at least 15 years, though it fell short of what groups like the ACLU had been pushing for. Since then, the group had been working with Kelly's office on the matter, though staffing changes could slow the process down. Bowman maintained the agency's COVID-19 mitigation tactics were working, though he said ""we are always concerned about the potential impact of community spread."" But with virus cases likely to rise in prisons in the near future — and reports of spotty mask wearing and access to sanitation supplies — Brett said officials needed to be thinking boldly. ""These are big problems that need to be met with creative, comprehensive solutions,"" she said. Andrew Bahl is a senior statehouse reporter for the Topeka Capital-Journal.

12/26/2021,"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis bemoaned Italy's plunging birthrate on Sunday, warning that the decline represented a threat to the future of the country. Births in Italy last year hit their lowest level since the unification of the nation in 1861, the national statistics office said this month, with the figure falling for a 12th consecutive year. ""The demographic winter is a real worry, at least here in Italy,"" the pope said in his weekly address in front of St. Peter's Basilica. ""It seems that a lot of people have lost the wish to have children. Lots of couples prefer to remain childless or to have one child only. ... It's a tragedy ... which runs counter to our families, our country and our future."" There were 404,892 births in Italy last year, the ISTAT statistics office said, down 15,192 from 2019. There were 746,146 deaths in 2020 as the population fell to 59.3 million. ISTAT said the slump in births had continued this year, adding that the COVID-19 pandemic appeared to be a factor in the decline.

12/26/2021,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin said Sunday he would ponder a slew of options if the West fails to meet his push for security guarantees precluding NATO's expansion to Ukraine. Earlier this month, Moscow submitted draft security documents demanding that NATO deny membership to Ukraine and other former Soviet countries and roll back its military deployments in Central and Eastern Europe. Putin has urged the West to move quickly to meet the demands, warning that Moscow will have to take “adequate military-technical measures” if the West continues its “aggressive” course “on the threshold of our home.” Asked to specify what such Moscow's response could be, he said in comments aired by Russian state TV Sunday that “it could be diverse,” adding without elaboration that “it will depend on what proposals our military experts submit to me.” The U.S. and its allies have refused to offer Russia the kind of guarantee on Ukraine that Putin wants, citing NATO’s principle that membership is open to any qualifying country. They agreed. however, to launch security talks with Russia next month to discuss its concerns. Putin said the talks with the U.S. will be held in Geneva. In parallel, negotiations are also set to be held between Russia and NATO and broader discussions are expected under the aegis of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. In remarks broadcast Sunday, Putin said that Russia submitted the demands in the hope of a constructive answer from the West. “We didn't do it just to see it blocked ... but for the purpose of reaching a negotiated diplomatic result that would be fixed in legally binding documents,"" Putin said. He reaffirmed that NATO membership for Ukraine or the deployment of alliance weapons there is a red line for Moscow that it wouldn't allow the West to cross. “We have nowhere to retreat,” he said, adding that NATO could deploy missiles in Ukraine that would take just four or five minutes to reach Moscow. “They have pushed us to a line that we can't cross. They have taken it to the point where we simply must tell them; ‘Stop!’"" He voiced concern that the U.S. and its allies could try to drag out the security talks and use them as a cover to pursue a military buildup near Russia. He noted that Russia published its security demands to make them known to the public and raise the pressure on the U.S. and its allies to negotiate a security deal. “We have just one goal — to reach agreements that would ensure the security of Russia and its citizens now and in a long-term perspective,” he said. The Kremlin presented its security demand amid the tensions over a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine in recent weeks that has fueled Western fears of a possible invasion. U.S. President Joe Biden warned Putin in a video call earlier this month that Russia will face “severe consequences” if it attacks Ukraine. Russia has denied an intention of launching an invasion and, in its turn, accused Ukraine of hatching plans to try to reclaim control of the territories held by Moscow-backed rebels by force. Ukraine has rejected the claim. Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and shortly after threw its support behind a separatist rebellion in the country’s east. Over more than seven years, the fighting has killed over 14,000 people and devastated Ukraine’s industrial heartland, known as the Donbas.",World/Associated Press,Putin to mull options if West refuses guarantees on Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/putin-mull-different-options-west-120418236.html
