3/7/2022,"TikTok has imposed restrictions on its service in Russia, and Netflix has suspended streaming there entirely, as western companies continue to pull out of the country. Chinese-owned TikTok said it would block livestreaming and uploading of new content in Russia after the Kremlin criminalised the spreading of what it deems to be fake news about its invasion of Ukraine. Netflix did not specify a reason for suspending its services on Sunday, saying the move reflected “circumstances on the ground”. The company had previously said it would refuse to air Russian state TV channels. TikTok said on Twitter it was a source of “relief and human connection during a time of war” but the safety of the video platform’s users and employees was its highest priority. The BBC, CNN and other global media outlets have temporarily suspended reporting in Russia to protect their journalists. 2/ In light of Russia's new ‘fake news’ law, we have no choice but to suspend livestreaming and new content to our video service while we review the safety implications of this law. Our in-app messaging service will not be affected. TikTok’s popularity with under-25s has extended to its Russia-Ukraine content, with content from UK-based TikTokers alone gathering millions of views, although the platform has also had to grapple with fake and misleading content. Social media companies have also clashed with the Kremlin, with Facebook and Twitter suspended in Russia in retaliation for blocking the state-backed news services Russia Today and Sputnik in the EU. Meanwhile, US credit card companies Visa, Mastercard and American Express said over the weekend they would cut services in Russia, although it will not stop domestic purchases. South Korea’s Samsung Electronics, a leading supplier of both smartphones and computer chips, said it would halt product shipments to the country, joining other big tech companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Intel and Dell. Two of the so-called big four accounting firms said on Sunday they were cutting ties to the country. KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers will end their relationships with their Russia-based member firms, each of which employs thousands of people. Ukraine’s minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, called on US technology companies on Sunday to do more to hit back against Russia. He tweeted open letters asking Apple and Google to shut down their app stores in Russia and for Amazon and Microsoft to suspend their cloud computing services. TikTok spokesperson Hilary McQuaide said the app in Russia now appears in “view-only” mode and won’t let people post or see new videos or livestreams. They can still see older videos, but not if they came from outside the country, she said. “The safety of employees is our top priority,” she said, adding that the video-sharing service part of China-based tech company ByteDance did not want to put either its Russian employees or users at risk of severe criminal penalties. Some protesters who have taken to the streets in Moscow, St Petersburg and other Russian cities to protest against the invasion of Ukraine have used social media platforms to broadcast their cause. The new “fake news” legislation, quickly rubber-stamped by both houses of the Kremlin-controlled parliament and signed by Putin, imposes prison sentences of up to 15 years for those spreading information that goes against the Russian government’s narrative on the war.",News/Technology,TikTok restricts service in Russia and Netflix stops streaming ,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/07/tiktok-restricts-service-in-russia-netflix-stops-streaming-ukraine
3/7/2022,"The Heartbreak Kid, Elaine May’s uproarious 1972 comedy, celebrates its 50th anniversary this year, but if you want to hold an honorary screening at your house, there’s no legitimate means for you to do so. The film, about a newlywed (Charles Grodin) who falls for a beautiful blonde (Cybil Shepherd) on his honeymoon, is not available on any streaming service. It’s no longer being produced on DVD or Blu-Ray, and not even Netflix’s old DVD-by-mail service has a copy on hand. There are a few used discs available for purchase from individual sellers, but that’s a risky and expensive proposition. Your only real option is to watch a pirated copy on YouTube, where it looks awful. The reason you can’t see The Heartbreak Kid legitimately is because a pharmaceutical company doesn’t want you to. Bristol Myers Squibb owns the rights to the film, a holdover from the brief period in the 1970s when its executives decided it would be cool to be in the movie business. In 2021, the company has announced no plans to sell the rights to an actual distributor. It’s strange. Even as Elaine May has become a cause celebre in film circles for her underappreciated work in the 1970s, The Heartbreak Kid is no closer to finding its audience. This is where Missing Movies comes in. A new advocacy organization composed of film-makers, distributors and film lovers, Missing Movies has a mission to “locate lost materials, clear rights, and advocate for policies and laws to make the full range of our cinema history available to all”. On its website is an initial list of “missing” movies, including The Heartbreak Kid, and the group has asked for help in expanding this list. Its initial goal is to draw attention to the problem, making viewers aware that the convenience of streaming services does not equate to widespread access to cinema history. Many films have already been lost and, without a concerted effort, another great purge could be on the way. “The popular conception among film fans is that 70-80% of silent films are missing, and that’s true,” says Dennis Doros of Milestone Films and a member of the Missing Movies working group. “I would say that with the digital tsunami that’s coming, that could be just as viable a percentage of total films unavailable in the world.” In 2017, film archivists at Martin Scorsese’s The Film Foundation estimated that half of all American films made before 1950 are now lost, and none of the major distributors are itching to find them. Streaming services may offer the appearance of infinite choice, but so many of them are increasingly focused on original programming, creating a bottleneck that squeezes out any film without a quantifiable audience. With algorithms designed to only show viewers what they already want to see, there are frighteningly few ways for a film to get back in. One such film is I Shot Andy Warhol, a 1996 biopic of Valerie Solanas, a radical feminist author who wrote a manifesto urging the killing of all men, and eventually tried to put her thesis into practice by shooting the titular guru of pop art. Despite winning an award at the Sundance film festival and earning largely positive reviews, the film has suffered the same fate as The Heartbreak Kid: it’s simply not available. Its director, Mary Harron, who is part of the working group at Missing Movies, explains the problem succinctly: “Most [indie films] are produced by small companies, and most of them go bankrupt.” This is especially true of films in the 80s and 90s, when new independent production companies were being created daily. Harron says I Shot Andy Warhol was sold three times before it was even released due to the ephemerality of the film distribution business. It has been a struggle for her to even determine who owns her first film, let alone convince them to distribute it or sell the rights to a company that will. Beyond the legal red tape, there are cultural issues that determine a film’s availability. “When you look at the kinds of films that are not available,” explains Amy Heller, co-founder of Milestone Film and Video, a boutique distribution company, and Missing Movies, “you see documentaries about poor people, Native Americans, queer people, disabled people. These images are part of our world, and we can’t afford to lose them.” Black directors are overrepresented on the list of missing movies, with films from Charles Burnett, Ossie Davis and William Greaves currently undistributed. Kiss of the Spider-Woman, an Oscar-nominated film about a gay revolutionary remains unavailable, while the Denzel Washington-starrer Mississippi Masala, about an interracial romance in the American South, was missing for years until Criterion announced it would be adding the film to its collection this spring. For some, the issue of availability starts when a film is first released. If a film doesn’t capture the zeitgeist, it becomes harder to secure its legacy, and female film-makers like May and Harron are perfect test cases. Their movies were celebrated at the time, but they both came up in eras when the press was distracted by new crops of male film-makers, and neither fit neatly into the narrative. May began making films when the New Hollywood crew of Scorsese, Coppola, Spielberg and Lucas was soaking up all the attention, while Harron burst on to the Sundance scene at the same time as Paul Thomas Anderson, David Fincher and Quentin Tarantino. “There was an unconscious bias that relegated films like mine or Elaine May’s,” says Harron, “and the things I was criticized for in I Shot Andy Warhol would be seen in a different light today.” Female film-makers already deal with challenges at every stage of production that men don’t face, but it’s shocking that in 2022, with the market for women-directed films so well established, these film-makers are still fighting to get their work seen. This is true of all films for film-makers of all underrepresented demographics, but even if Missing Movies films get distribution, who will see them? When The Heartbreak Kid gets its long-awaited distribution, students of film history will celebrate its release like it’s Christmas morning, but how will more casual movie fans even find it? I Shot Andy Warhol will surely show up on a streaming service at some point, but will the young women with whom it might resonate the most be able to find it there? For some, if it’s not promoted or highlighted on the homepage, it might as well not exist. These are perhaps unsolvable problems inherent in a movie landscape dominated by streamers, but at this point, simply saving movies from the dustbin of history is a worthy short-term goal. “These images are part of our world,” according to Heller, “and we can’t afford to lose them.”",Arts/Film,‘We can’t afford to lose them’: the fight to bring missing movies back,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/07/missing-movies-streaming-initiative
3/7/2022,"A German woman has been questioned by Thai police after she entered the back of the ambulance transporting the body of cricket great Shane Warne off Koh Samui island. Warne’s body was on Sunday taken from Koh Samui island by ferry to Surat Thani on the mainland and a local hospital where the official autopsy was due to take place. His remains are now expected to be prepared for an air transfer to Melbourne. Warne’s remains were accompanied by his friends, the Australian ambassador to Thailand, Allan McKinnon, and Dfat officials, but they were not with the van when it was parked on the car ferry, the ABC reported. ABC video footage showed a blonde woman accompanied by a Thai woman talking to local immigration officials by the car ferry. The pair was then escorted to the ambulance parked on the ferry where the blonde woman approached the driver’s window holding flowers. They had a brief exchange before he escorted her to the other side of the van and allowed her to enter for less than a minute. The woman attended the local police station on Monday morning and spoke with the superintendent of the station. McKinnon earlier told media Thai police and hospital staff were facilitating the return of Warne’s body to Australia as quickly as possible. “They’ve been very compassionate, very efficient and very understanding,” he said. The 52-year-old Australian was found unresponsive in his villa about 5.15pm on Friday after he did not arrive for dinner with friends as scheduled. One of the paramedics called to the scene on Friday described how Warne’s friends desperately tried to revive him by applying CPR. Warne was later pronounced dead at the local hospital with Bo Phut police confirming his death shortly afterwards. Bo Phut police station superintendent Yuttana Sirisombat has said Warne had been suffering chest pains before arriving in Thailand. He also had asthma and had seen a doctor about his heart. Warne visited a local tailor before his death. Parsuram Panday said on Monday that the ex-cricketer was “happy and playful” when he saw him for the first time in two years due to the Covid pandemic. “His body looked the same, he’s a sportsman, he looked fresh,” Panday told the Guardian. “He was funny. He played belly punching with me. He was a nice man. He smoked. He didn’t smoke before but this time I saw him smoking. I don’t know what happened to him. I don’t know. He looked strong. I heard it was a heart attack.” The tailor said he was due to have a fitting with Warne at his villa on Saturday but would now “drop his suit to the hotel”. The Sporting News chief executive, Tom Hall, has revealed Warne’s last meal was a plate of Vegemite toast shared with a friend at the Thailand resort where he died hours later. “I have dined with Shane in many fine establishments, but rather than sample some of the local Thai fare, we tuck into a plate of Vegemite on toast,” Hall wrote in an article on the outlet’s website. “Shane chomping away: ‘Geez, you can’t beat Vegemite with some butter, always great wherever you are in the world’. An Australian through and through – this was to turn out to be his last meal.” Police have aid there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding Warne’s death which is believed to have been caused by a heart attack. Police are expected to reveal details of the autopsy later on Monday night Australian time.",Sport/Sport,Shane Warne death: woman questioned after climbing into ambulance transporting body,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/07/shane-warne-death-woman-questioned-after-climbing-into-ambulance-transporting-body
3/7/2022,"Like many of you I’ve hardly been able to think about anything else these past ten days apart from the war in Ukraine. So today’s puzzles are a celebration of Lviv, Ukraine’s western city, which played an important role in the history of 20th century mathematics. During the 1930s, a remarkable group of scholars came up with new ideas, methods and theorems that helped shape the subject for decades. The Lwów school of mathematics – at that time, the city was in Poland – was a closely-knit circle of Polish mathematicians, including Stefan Banach, Stanisław Ulam and Hugo Steinhaus, who made important contributions to areas including set-theory, topology and analysis. These friends had unconventional working habits. Much of their time was spent in cafés, in particular the Scottish Café, where a thick notebook was set aside to record important problems and solutions. The so-called “Scottish book” has a legendary status in the mathematical community, surviving the Second World War, and ultimately inspiring further research. Some of its 200-odd problems remain open. Of the many ideas introduced by the Lwów school, one of the best known is the “ham sandwich theorem,” posed by Steinhaus and solved by Banach using a result of Ulam’s. It states that it is possible to slice a ham sandwich in two with a single slice that cuts each slice of bread and the ham into two equal sizes, whatever the size and positions of the bread and the ham. Today’s puzzles are also about dividing food. The first is from Hugo Steinhaus’ One Hundred Problems in Elementary Mathematics, published in 1938. The second uses a method involved in the proof of the ham sandwich theorem. 1) Three friends each contribute £4 to buy a £12 ham. The first friend divides it into three parts, asserting the weights are equal. The second friend, distrustful of the first, reweighs the pieces and judges them to be worth £3, £4 and £5. The third, distrustful of them both, weighs the ham on their own scales, getting another result. If each friend insists that their weighings are correct, how can they share the pieces (without cutting them anew) in such a way that each of them would have to admit they got at least £4 of ham? 2) Ten plain and 14 seeded rolls are randomly arranged in a circle, equidistantly spaced, as below. Show that using a straight line it is possible to divide the circle into two halves such that there are an equal number of plain and seeded rolls on either side of the line. I’ll be back at 5pm UK with the solutions.

3/7/2022,"At 65, Bryony Harris withdrew her pension in a lump sum and enrolled on a psychotherapy course. “I like that I used my pension to train for a new career,” she says. Now, at 74, she has a thriving psychotherapy practice in Fredrikstad, Norway. “I just knew it was the right time, and I felt equipped to do it. It was the very best thing I ever did for myself.” The four-year course was in Jutland, a peninsula on the west coast of Denmark, where for a week a month Harris was “among sand dunes with this amazing empty wild beach right outside”. To get there, Harris drove for five hours through southern Norway. “It always felt like coming home,” she says. “I was a sponge, soaking up this stuff.” When she first arrived, she realised she was at least 20 years older than everyone else, but was never made to feel any different. Her experience was transformative, “a calling”. Practising psychotherapy, she says, “helps me to understand the word ‘vocation’.” And yet Harris has had many careers over the decades. At university in Kingston upon Thames, London, she trained as an architect, and after she qualified and married, worked as one “for short and long periods” while raising four children. Next came a stint as a photographer on a community arts project, then teaching photography, then working in a refuge. “The world offered more possibilities than I had ever realised,” Harris says. She regards these moves as gradual shifts rather than reinvention. “I have never made a decision such as ‘I’m going to stop doing that and do something else.’ It’s always been a gentle progression.” How does one progress gently from architecture to photography? “Oh, you’d be amazed. Via a bookshop, actually,” she says. She and her husband had a dream to open a shop specialising in books about folklore, mythology and tradition. The shop, in Hatherleigh, Devon, is “where the seeds of therapy were sown. Because in a small independent bookshop, people open up and talk.” Mind you, Harris also says that her “therapy side was lurking in the background” when she taught photography. In Norway, she worked at a refuge for people who had experienced abuse. In her 40s, she had a short period of counselling. She no longer recalls exactly why, but it must have been decisive because when she turned 60, she resolved to write letters “to people who had been hugely influential in my life and probably were never aware of it”. She searched for her former counsellor, but couldn’t find him. In 1991, Harris and her husband separated, and six years later, while “in a bit of limbo”, some Norwegian friends asked her to house-sit. She went with her youngest child, who was then 13. She learned Norwegian, freelanced as a photographer and stayed. “There were many reasons why I moved to Norway. Some were to come and find something, and some were to put distance between things,” she says. “I think deep down, I knew I wouldn’t come back.” Harris is very can-do. The best psychotherapy course was in Denmark, so first she had to learn Danish. “I really love a good challenge. Sometimes you can feel very stuck, but that is how I have lived my life,” she says. As a child, Harris’s parents liked moving. She had nine homes before she went to university. “Now, I have no desire to uproot myself.” Her flat looks out over an estuary, and she has lived there longer than she has lived anywhere. Each week brings fresh calls to her practice. “It feels very rewarding. I like that notion, that one is actually able to give back as a result of a long life.” Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?",Lifestyle/Life and style,A new start after 60: ‘I became a psychotherapist at 69 and found my calling’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/07/a-new-start-after-60-i-became-a-psychotherapist-at-69-and-found-my-calling
3/7/2022,"I recently received two fines for driving my car into the Birmingham clean air zone and feel I have been unfairly treated. The letters both stated I had 14 days to pay a reduced rate of £60 for each fine. After that, the full £120 fine would be payable. I appealed on the basis that I live outside Birmingham and was unaware the zone had been introduced. I missed the signs, as I was navigating using a satnav. I also feel somewhat aggrieved as the second fine was technically deemed the next day. I drove out of the zone seven minutes after midnight. I’m a diligent driver and have never received a parking fine or speeding ticket, and as the clean air zone was so new I naively thought they might let me off at least one of the charges. Birmingham council took several weeks to respond and reject my appeal, by which time the 14 days early payment window had expired. I feel that I should at least have the right to pay the “reduced” £60 fine if my appeal is not successful. NS, by email How many people living outside the West Midlands are even aware that Birmingham’s clean air zone went live in June 2021? Not that many, I suspect, and one of the reasons for publishing this letter is to highlight its introduction. There are also similar schemes in Bath and Portsmouth, alongside the pioneer, London. The rules in the Birmingham zone are pretty clear. Diesel cars that are not of Euro 6 standard or higher – which typically means those built before 2015-ish – and pre-Euro 4 petrol cars (pre-2006) have to pay the £8 daily charge, which, as you found out to your cost runs from midnight to midnight. Those entering have to pay the charge within six days, or face a penalty. Sadly, ignorance of its introduction is not enough to get you off. However, I do agree that those who appeal against the fine should at least be given the right to pay the reduced £60 rate if their appeal is unsuccessful. In London, if a driver appeals within the reduced-rate period, the clock is then stopped and they retain the right to pay at the lower charge, even where the appeal takes longer. Birmingham city council tells me that is not the case there. This seems to me an affront to natural justice, is an incentive for the council to process appeals slowly, and should be changed. The council says its approach is in line with the Road User Charging (Enforcement and Adjudication) Regulations 2001. It says 530,000 fine notices were issued in the first six months of operation, and there is clear guidance on its website. One of the odd things about this is Google Maps doesn’t warn those driving into the Birmingham zone of its existence. If you ask it to direct you into the London Ulez, a warning flashes up. Birmingham says this is on the way. Meanwhile, others be warned. Clean air zones are coming in Bradford, Manchester and Bristol.

3/7/2022,"Q I bought my house in June 2019, before I met my partner. When I met him, he was looking to buy a house and did so about 12 months later in late January 2021. He lived in the property for about six months before moving in with me in early August 2021. He started renting out his house the following month and got permission to let from his mortgage company. At this point, he changed his address, moved all of his possessions and furniture in with me and since October 2021, has contributed monthly to the mortgage and bills for the house. He is registered to vote at this address, his car insurance is registered to this address and he is registered with a local GP. Although his name has never been on the deeds or mortgage we have treated the house as though it was both of our main residence. The house that he rents out contains none of his personal items or possessions and he plans to continue renting this house out long term. We are now in the process of selling my house and purchasing a home together. My partner will continue to own his house that he rents out, but has no plans to live there again. Should we pay the higher rate of stamp duty when we buy the house together, or does this situation qualify as replacing one main residence with another?HM A Looking at an example in HM Revenue and Customs’ online stamp duty land tax (SDLT) manual, it seems that you will have to pay the higher rate of SDLT on the home you buy together. If you imagine that you are Ms B and your partner is Mr P, you will find that the example describes your situation exactly: “Mr P and Ms B, who are not married to one another, each own a residential property, with neither having any interest in the other’s property. They both live in the property owned by Ms B; the property owned by Mr P is rented out. Ms B is selling her property and they are jointly purchasing a new one, which will be their new main residence. Mr P will retain his rented-out property.” The guidance goes on to say that your situation does not qualify as replacing one main residence with another so “the transaction is a higher rates transaction”. It would be a completely different story if you were married or in a civil partnership. The higher rates do not apply to a joint purchase of a new main residence where a married couple both own property but have lived together in one of the properties as their main residence. Both parties – unlike Ms B and Mr P – count as replacing a main residence but only because they are married.",Lifestyle/Money,My partner owns a house – what stamp duty do we pay if we buy another one?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/07/my-partner-owns-a-house-what-stamp-duty-do-we-pay-if-we-buy-another-one
3/7/2022,"Research shows that people in wealthier, high-consuming countries can help avert climate breakdown by making six relatively straightforward lifestyle changes, creating a society of “less stuff and more joy”. Experts say if enacted these “shifts” would account for a quarter of the required emissions reductions needed to keep the global heating down to 1.5C and increase pressure on government and the private sector to make the necessary far-reaching systemic change. The research has inspired the Jump campaign, urging people to sign up to make the changes. Tom Bailey, one of its co-founders, said if pledging to make all six shifts is too daunting, just making a start on some of them can make a difference. Keep electronic products – smartphones, personal computers, smartwatches and TVs – for at least seven years. “The addiction to gadgets and buying ‘stuff’ in general is a major contributor to carbon emissions,” according to the report. The process of extracting rare earth metals and producing ever more products often generates more emissions than using the items themselves, the study shows. For example, only 13% of an iPhone 11’s lifetime emissions are down to its use; the other 86% are associated with its production, transport and end-of-life processing. “We typically replace these products for an upgraded model at least every couple of years,” says Bailey. “The target is to keep electronic products for five to seven years – their full optimum lifetime.” He says people should try repairing equipment, borrowing, renting or buying second hand, adding: “If you really need something then keep new items to a minimum.” Many people have become accustomed to owning a car and for some their vehicle is essential either for work or because they are disabled or live in a remote area. But car ownership is driving huge emissions, the research shows. Globally, transport is responsible for about a quarter of overall greenhouse gas emissions, and more than two-thirds of this comes from the engines of road vehicles. Campaigners are calling on those who can to stop using private vehicles – ideally getting rid of any they own – and to turn instead to public transport, walking, cycling or car clubs. “If you were planning on buying a car, see if you can hold off and find alternatives which can get you where you need to go,” said Bailey. “If you are feeling brave, get rid of the car/s you have, or see if you can join a car-sharing scheme to share the benefit – and the emissions.” The study says that although there is a lot of emphasis on the role of electric vehicles (EVs) in tackling climate change, a bigger effort needs to go towards reducing the number of cars on the road overall as a significant source of emissions is in the manufacture of vehicles – even EVs. The clothing and textiles industry accounts for more greenhouse gas emissions than international aviation and shipping combined and the rise of fast, disposable fashion is accelerating that trend. Bailey says: “Lower prices often means poorer quality clothes that don’t last as long; but these low prices have also resulted from unseen human and environmental costs such as pollution of rivers, poor working conditions, low wages and exploitation of workers in factories.” Campaigners are therefore urging people to buy second hand, repair or adjust existing items and restrict purchases to three items a year – ideally ones that are durable and will last. Bailey said: “These clothes might be more expensive, but it is worth considering the cost per wear. If it will last three times as long but is only double the price, that’s a financial saving over the lifetime of the item and better for the environment too.” More than 25% of total global emissions come from the food system and today’s research shows there are three changes to diet that would dramatically reduce the impact of the food we eat: Move to a mostly plant-based diet. Eat everything you buy. Eat healthy amounts.  1. Make at least one of your main meals vegetarian 2. Double the veg, halve the meat 3. Eat no red meat 4. Set yourself a maximum number of animal products to consume today 5. Eat no processed meat 6. Try a new vegetarian recipe Bailey said: “Changing our behaviours around food is the most impactful of all the shifts. And it’s not just about climate change; if you look at biodiversity loss, land use change, fertilisers in the ocean creating dead zones and the massive extinction and loss of insects due to pesticides, these problems are all driven by food. Aviation contributes to about 2% of overall global emissions and this figure is increasing more than any other form of transport. Flying is also highly unequal: in the UK, 70% of all flights are taken by just 15% of the population. The research found the global average number of return flights per person in 2017 was one short-haul return every one to two years. Experts say halving this number – committing to one short-haul return flight every three years or one long-haul flight every eight years – would have a huge impact. Bailey said: “We can still see the world: flying abroad 15 to 20 times over a lifetime, or travelling more slowly overland to different places. But we need to get realistic about the impact of weekend city breaks abroad. Why not visit all the incredible places we have closer to home?” The report suggests choosing holiday destinations closer to home that you can access by train, ferry or bus. It also advocates making use of technology such as video calls to keep in touch with family and friends. The actions outlined above can lead to huge reductions in global emissions – 25% of that required to keep to 1.5C of warming – but the research is also clear that the bulk of reductions will come from systemic change made by governments and the private sector. To help transform the system campaigners are calling for people to make at least one change in their own lives. Ideas include: Changing to a green energy supplier. For those who can afford it, installing energy efficiency measures at home such as insulation and heat pumps. Switching your pension to a green investor. Using ethical and green banks. Using energy efficiently at home. Pushing for change through activism or peaceful protest or writing to your MP. Bailey says: “This shift is different to the others because the research doesn’t imply that individuals are responsible for changing global systems. However, we know that personal shifts to our own lives can, collectively, have a massive impact.”",News/Environment,Six promises you can make to help reduce carbon emissions,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/07/six-promises-you-can-make-to-help-reduce-carbon-emissions
3/7/2022,"When Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted last December of procuring minor teenagers for the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse, their victims expressed joy and relief that long-delayed justice had finally been served. Less than one week later, however, a juror’s comments revealed that he apparently did not disclose childhood sexual abuse during jury selection – sparking a chain of events that could now potentially undermine the trial’s outcome. Following prosecution and defense requests to investigate the juror Scotty David’s comments – and Maxwell’s calls for a retrial – Judge Alison Nathan said that she will question him under oath on Tuesday. While David said he would invoke his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination, prosecutors are seeking immunity for him which, if obtained, would compel him to testify. “To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on the jury,” Judge Nathan said in a 24 February order. “Rather, it is the potential failure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that material information so that any potential bias could be explored.” Veteran attorneys told the Guardian that there is a high bar for overturning a jury verdict. While unlikely, it is possible that Maxwell could get a new trial: a prospect that will be stunning for many involved in the long hunt for the former British socialite and those who have followed the Epstein saga for years. With Epstein having killed himself in a New York jail cell, Maxwell’s trial and guilty verdict was seen as a form of justice for the victims of the sex trafficking ring, especially given the elite and powerful status of so many in Epstein’s social circle. But the spat over David has thrown a spanner in the works and seemingly thrown Maxwell an unlikely potential lifeline. David’s explanation for why he marked the no box on a screening questionnaire that asked: “Have you or a friend ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?” will be key to the outcome of the hearing. “Depending upon how this hearing goes, it could absolutely throw the verdict into disarray,” said David S Weinstein, a partner at Jones Walker who previously worked as a federal prosecutor. “It doesn’t mean it absolutely will, but there is a greater likelihood than before, when we didn’t know as many facts.” A key question is whether David’s seeming omission deprived Maxwell of an opportunity to select jurors in her case. Prosecutors and defense attorneys are able to challenge potential panelists during jury selection, with possible bias being a key factor. Maxwell’s attorneys have contended they would have challenged David had they known his history – and that he would have been excused. “If it turns out that he knowingly and intentionally misled the lawyers on both sides with his answers, then [Nathan] can decide if that, in and of itself, deprived the defendant of a fair trial by denying [Maxwell] the opportunity to select jurors,” Weinstein said. Ron Kuby, a criminal defense attorney of nearly four decades, said: “This claim of juror misconduct is a substantial claim – given even more substance based on reporting that the juror will invoke his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination.” “I’ve never seen a juror take the fifth,” Kuby said. Kuby said that claims of juror misconduct – such as claims that they were bullied into rendering a certain verdict, or allegations that they read coverage of the case – are not uncommon after trials. But, “those claims don’t tend to change the outcome because that conduct is immaterial.” However, David claimed to have been sexually abused as a child, which is important, given that Maxwell’s trial was about sexual abuse of teenage girls. “This goes, in many ways, to the heart of the case,” Kuby said of the controversy surrounding these developments. Moira Penza, a partner at Wilkinson Stekloff who, while working as an assistant US attorney in Brooklyn, successfully prosecuted the Nxivm sex cult case, said judges rarely overturn verdicts. Penza said this was an “unusual situation”, but didn’t want to make predictions about what might unfold, especially given the complexity of the events. “We’ve already had Judge Nathan decide that an evidentiary hearing was warranted so really, at this point, we wait and see what happens at Tuesday’s hearing,” Penza said. “If juror No 50 is granted immunity, and is therefore compelled to testify and is unable to assert the fifth amendment, what we’ll see is an inquiry from Judge Nathan as to how this juror questionnaire was filled out with a negative response to the sexual abuse question,” she said. “I think it’s really important that Judge Nathan has already stated that just an affirmative answer to the sexual abuse question would not, in and of itself, disqualify juror No 50 from sitting on the jury. “The question really becomes: was there an intentional misrepresentation that would have allowed for a cause challenge by the defense to keep him off the jury?” David’s attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Maxwell was found guilty on sex trafficking and other related charges for facilitating Epstein’s sexual abuse of minor teens, some just 14 years old. Maxwell has maintained her innocence. Epstein, a convicted sex offender who once counted Prince Andrew among his rich and powerful associates, was arrested in July 2019 for sex trafficking minor teens. He killed himself about one month later in a Manhattan federal jail, while awaiting his trial.",News/US news,Ghislaine Maxwell juror’s grilling by judge could cast verdict into disarray,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/07/ghislaine-maxwell-juror-judge-questioning-sexual-abuse
3/7/2022,"The Galaxy S22+ is Samsung’s big-screen premium phone for 2022, offering top specs and good quality hardware, but little in the way of novel or exciting features. It’s a safe, solid device. With an RRP of £949 ($999/A$1,549) that doesn’t mean low cost, but it is £200 cheaper than the all-singing, all-dancing £1,149 S22 Ultra superphone with its Galaxy Note-like design. Shop around, though, and you should soon be able to find it for less. The S22+ is similar to last year’s S21+ with a flat glass front and back and solid-feeling aluminium sides. It looks and feels refined rather than flashy, and while it has a big 6.6in screen it is fairly easy to hold with sharper edges to grip with your fingers and a relatively light 195g weight. The 120Hz AMOLED display looks fantastic with vibrant colours, good viewing angles and an extremely high peak brightness of 1,750nits (a standard measure of screen brightness), which is enabled when in direct sunlight making it easier to see outdoors than its rivals. Main screen: 6.6in FHD+ Dynamic Amoled 2X (393ppi) 120Hz Processor: Samsung Exynos 2200 (EU) or Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 (US) RAM: 8GB of RAM Storage: 128 or 256GB Operating system: One UI 4.1 based on Android 12 Camera: Triple rear camera: 50MP wide, 12MP ultra-wide, 10MP 3x telephoto; 10MP front-facing Connectivity: 5G, dual nano sim, USB-C, wifi 6E, NFC, Bluetooth 5.2, UWB and GNSS Water resistance: IP68 (1.5m for 30 mins) Dimensions: 157.4 x 75.8 x 7.6mm Weight: 195g In the US the S22+ has the standard top Android chip for 2022 from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. But in the EU it has a Samsung Exynos 2200 with the first mobile graphics processor designed by AMD, the company behind the chips used in the Xbox Series X and PS5 games consoles. Testing the EU version, general performance was excellent, although not perceptibly faster than the already snappy models of last year. Gaming performance of the AMD graphics was more variable than Qualcomm-using competitors, likely requiring optimisation for games. The battery lasts for about 35 hours between charges, on 5G for two hours and wifi for the rest, using the screen for about five hours in various chat apps, the camera, Spotify, Chrome and a light spot of gaming. That’s enough for a good day of use, but slightly shorter than last year’s model and miles behind the market-leading 48-hour-plus Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max. Samsung does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery. Those in similar devices typically maintain at least 80% of their original capacity for at least 500 full charge cycles. The phone is generally repairable. Screen repairs cost £179, while the battery is replaceable by authorised service centres. But the phone only scores a three out of 10 on iFixit’s repairability ranking. Several internal components are made from 20% recycled nylon or plastic. Samsung offers trade-in and recycling schemes for old devices. The company publishes annual sustainability reports but not impact assessments for individual products. The S22+ ships with OneUI 4.1, which is based on the latest version of Android 12 and receives prompt updates unlike some competitors. It is a refined version of Android that offers plenty of customisation options and useful tools. The S22+ will receive at least five years of software updates from release, including four major Android version updates and monthly security patches, making it one of the longest-lasting Android devices available and just behind Apple’s six-year-plus support for its iPhones. The S22+ has a triple camera system on the back: a 50MP main, 12MP ultra-wide and a 10MP 3x telephoto camera. The main camera is excellent, capturing really good images in a variety of lighting conditions. Its low-light performance is significantly improved over previous models, dramatically brightening scenes. It does, however, sometimes lose contrast in the process with a tendency to make people look like you’ve shone a flash in their face. The telephoto camera has a 3x optical zoom and produces sharper images in good light than last year’s model, but it still struggles in low light settings producing bright but heavily processed images. The ultra-wide camera produces slightly crisper images in good light and handles lower light levels better than before. The 10MP selfie camera did an excellent job of balancing detail and grain in fairly challenging light, producing pleasing, detailed shots the majority of the time. Samsung’s video capture remains ahead of most of the Android pack shooting up to 8K at 24 frames a second and with plenty of features, including a new auto-framing system that tries to keep up to 10 people in focus and in shot at any one time. Overall the S22+’s camera is very good, but falls slightly short of the very best on the market. The Samsung Galaxy S22+ costs from £949 ($999/A$1,549) with 128GB of storage. For comparison, the Galaxy S22 costs £769, the S22 Ultra costs £1,149, the Z Flip 3 costs £949, the Google Pixel 6 Pro costs £849 and the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max costs £1,049. Everything about the Galaxy S22+ feels premium but it lacks a certain wow factor, particularly next to Samsung’s other £949 folding flip phone. The screen is great, the camera is good, performance is snappy and the battery life is reasonable. These are all big upgrades on old models, but no more than expected in a top phone in 2022. The S22+ feels nicer and is easier to hold than many rivals. In theory it is more durable, made from stronger aluminium and the hardest smartphone glass available. It will receive at least five years of software updates from release, making it the longest-lasting Android phone available and only slightly behind Apple’s iPhone. It is the first Samsung phone to be partially made from recycled materials, too. Buy it at lower than RRP, around the £750-£800 that previous models have been readily been available, and it offers a lot of phone for the money. Keep it for the five years you can safely use it thanks to security updates and it offers better value than many cheaper rivals. Pros: 120Hz screen, good camera, One UI 4.1/Android 12, good performance, decent battery life, fast fingerprint scanner, five years of software support, contains recycled materials, premium feel. Cons: big, expensive, no headphone socket, battery life and camera bettered by others, no flashy features.

3/7/2022,"People in well-off countries can help avert climate breakdown by making six relatively straightforward lifestyle changes, according to research from three leading institutions. The study found that sticking to six specific commitments – from flying no more than once every three years to only buying three new items of clothing a year – could rein in the runaway consumption that is partially driving the climate crisis. The research carried out by academics at Leeds University and analysed by experts at the global engineering firm Arup and the C40 group of world cities, found that making the six commitments could account for a quarter of the emissions reductions required to keep the global heating down to 1.5C. The study was published on Monday alongside the launch of a new climate movement to persuade and support relatively well off people to make “The Jump” and sign up to the six pledges. Tom Bailey, co-founder of the campaign said: “This ends once and for all the debate about whether citizens can have a role in protecting our earth. We don’t have time to wait for one group to act, we need ‘all action from all actors now’.” Last week the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued its “bleakest warning yet”, saying the climate crisis was accelerating rapidly with only a narrow chance left of avoiding its worst ravages. Fossil fuel companies have been aware of their impact on the planet since at least the 1950s The physicist Edward Teller tells the American Petroleum Institute (API) a 10% increase in CO2 will be sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York. “I think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe.” Lyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API warned the industry: “Time is running out.” Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases. A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases. An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”. The Nasa scientist James Hansen testifies to the US Senate that “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.” A confidential report prepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states. Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies establish the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions. Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research. Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”. At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.” Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out an ad in The New York Times titled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.” The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC. The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose main donors are in the oil and gas industry, leads the “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which ends in disarray. A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals 90 companies are responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century. The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry. Exxon, Chevron and BP each donate at least $500,000 for the inauguration of Donald Trump as president. Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the biggest threat to the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming. Jonathan Watts Bailey said as the world reaches the edge of ecological collapse, it needed a workable alternative to this ‘universal consumer society’ in the next decade. “The research is clear that governments and the private sector have the largest role to play but it is also equally clear from our analysis that individuals and communities can make a huge difference.” The Jump campaign asks people to sign up to take the following six “shifts” for one, three or six months:  Eat a largely plant-based diet, with healthy portions and no waste  Buy no more than three new items of clothing per year  Keep electrical products for at least seven years  Take no more than one short haul flight every three years and one long haul flight every eight years  Get rid of personal motor vehicles if you can – and if not keep hold of your existing vehicle for longer  Make at least one life shift to nudge the system, like moving to a green energy, insulating your home or changing pension supplier The campaign was officially kicked off on Saturday and Bailey said there was already a growing movement emerging in response to the evidence with Jump groups up and running around the country. “This is not just new information, or a normal behaviour change ‘campaign’, but a fun movement that is working to go way beyond the usual ‘greenie’ suspects,” said Bailey. “A movement that is able to engage all types of people … engaging and being led by communities of colour and the economically excluded.” Bailey said there has been a widespread belief in climate circles in recent years that individual action was relatively ineffective and the only option was to get out on the streets and demand system change from governments and corporations. “Obviously this is still hugely important but what this research shows is that there is a role for a new joyful climate movement which can help lead the way to less stuff and more joy.” Some of the shifts the campaign calls for are, at least partially, dependent on systemic change – the prohibitive cost of train fares might leave individuals with little choice but to use short haul flights for essential journeys; public transport maybe expensive or nonexistent in areas of the country, leaving people with no choice but to use their car. Bailey was the lead author of Labour’s plan to decarbonise the UK’s energy sector at the last election. He has worked in the green energy sector in the UK, US and China for the past 15 years, and said individual actions could have a cascade effect, leading to community level action and ultimately contributing to systemic change. Although not everyone would be able to commit to all the pledges, just “making a start” could have a big impact, he said. “This isn’t going back to the stone age, it’s just finding a balance. Less consuming in relatively rich western countries can mean more creativity, comedy, connection … Live for joy, not for stuff.” The research is based on a study by academics at Leeds University, Arup and the C40 group of leading cities which assesses the impact of consumption by people in the world’s leading cities. Analysis of that data has found that six steps set out above could cut global emissions by between 25% and 27%. Ben Smith, director of climate change at Arup, who led the analysis said that as scientific evidence mounts, it was clear that all sections of society had to act. “Our research shows that all of us, from politicians, city and business leaders to individual citizens, have important roles to play. And it is clear there’s lots that we can do as individuals, and that this is one of the easiest and quickest places to start”.",News/Environment,"Six key lifestyle changes can help avert the climate crisis, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/07/six-key-lifestyle-changes-can-help-avert-the-climate-crisis-study-finds
3/7/2022,"Omicron is receding in the US and states and cities are lifting remaining restrictions. Public health experts, however, are urging leaders to use the lull to prepare for future outbreaks. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently announced new guidelines for judging community risk, shifting focus from cases to hospitalizations. More than 90% of the US is now at low risk of overwhelming health systems, which means requirements for masks and other precautions can be loosened, the CDC said. Most states and cities had already dropped mask mandates and vaccination requirements or announced plans to end them. Others did so after the change in guidance. With only 65% of the population fully vaccinated, the US was buffeted by Omicron. It is now seeing an average of 54,000 cases and 1,300 deaths each day. But cases and hospitalizations are declining very rapidly, which is “reassuring”, said Abraar Karan, an infectious disease physician at Stanford University. Large swaths of the population have some form of protection from Covid, through vaccination or prior infection or both. “Even if you pull back on mitigation measures, you may not have a big rise in cases,” Karan said. But he was also worried that might lull the public and leaders into thinking the pandemic is over. Officials should use this time to prepare for the next surge and the next variant, which could be more severe or more transmissible, Karan said. “Once we have another variant, whenever that may be, the amount of spread from that variant will depend on what kind of preparedness we do now. What are we doing to make schools, workplaces and public spaces more safe?” The US should continue investing in masks, tests, ventilation, vaccination campaigns, wastewater monitoring and other measures to prevent and respond to the next surge, experts said. And when the next wave begins rising, communities should pay careful attention to changing levels of risk. “We need to expect the unexpected with Covid-19,” said Jason Salemi, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of South Florida College of Public Health. The US had limited national precautions throughout the pandemic, with mask mandates for federal buildings and transportation corridors and some restrictions on international travel. Pandemic response has largely fallen instead to states, cities and counties, producing a patchwork set of rules. Cities like New York, Chicago and Washington are lifting indoor mask mandates and proof of vaccination requirements. Los Angeles, the most populous county in the US, lifted its indoor mask mandate at the end of February, for those who can show proof of vaccination or a negative test. Atlanta and New Orleans also lifted indoor mask mandates. California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Rhode Island recently lifted or announced plans to lift indoor or school mask mandates. On 26 March, Hawaii will end requirements for travelers to show proof of vaccination or negative tests, or to quarantine. Businesses may still require masks and proof of vaccination and individuals should mask if they are high-risk or in hospitals or nursing homes, the CDC said. Those who test positive should continue masking regardless of community levels. The CDC is still reviewing federal mask mandates, including on transportation. The guidelines are intended to show when masks are necessary again, offering a data-driven approach to preventing health systems from being overwhelmed. “​​We want to give people a break from things like mask wearing when our levels are low, and then have the ability to reach for them again if things get worse in the future,” the CDC director, Rochelle Walensky, said on a call with reporters. But there was political pressure to lift pandemic rules, particularly among Democrats looking to the next election, and some public health experts have worried the new guidance doesn’t focus enough on preventing new infections. “I’ve seen a lot of people’s very, very legitimate concerns about if you’re focusing on hospitalizations … it is more of a lagged indicator,” Salemi said. “If there is a new variant that emerges and we start to see infection rates rise, by just focusing on hospitalizations and hospital burden, are we missing an opportunity to act sooner?” The new guidance is more reactive instead of proactive, he said, adding that it also puts the onus on the most vulnerable, including immunocompromised people, to protect themselves from potentially devastating infections. Without more preparation, another surge could be devastating in the US, Karan said. “I’m actually pretty scared that it’s going to be the same thing that happened previously. We’re going to be scrambling to get updated vaccines out, we’re going to be scrambling to get people masks and rapid tests, we’ll be completely overwhelmed because of exponential spread.” That’s why prevention and preparation now are so important, he said. “You don’t prepare for the best-case scenario,” Karan said. “I’m not sitting here with wishful thinking – that’s not a strategy.”",News/US news,Experts urge US cities and states to prep for future outbreaks as Omicron slows,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/07/us-covid-future-variants-outbreaks-omicron
3/7/2022,"This, blessedly, is now Anne Tyler’s fourth novel since she suggested that 2015’s A Spool of Blue Thread was going to be her last. We might fairly think that some of the things she has said in recent interviews aren’t exactly engraved in stone, not least because French Braid, a warm family saga set between 1959 and the late summer of 2020, appears to represent a U-turn on her intuition that “it’d be really wrongheaded of me to suddenly start talking about the coronavirus at this stage in one of my books”. Responding to a question about whether Covid might break her aversion to putting topical elements in her work, she said: “It would derail the small private story I’m trying to tell.”After her previous novel, the terrific Redhead By the Side of the Road, generously centred on the blinkered perspective of a middle-aged IT guy, French Braid returns to type: a multigenerational ensemble piece that will have fans marking their Tyler bingo cards, from empty nesters taking later-life left turns and family rifts surrounding odd-one-out siblings.Set, as usual, in Baltimore, it’s the story of the Garretts: husband and wife Robin and Mercy, children Alice, Lily and David. We meet them on a rare holiday to a Maryland lake, with the girls in their teens and their younger brother a curious seven-year-old happiest playing make-believe with his toys. But Robin, a plumber turned shopkeeper, has other ideas, and his heavy-handed attempt to break David’s reluctance to swim will set family tensions simmering down the decades.As trauma plots go, it’s not exactly A Little Life, sure, but Tyler has a keen eye for the way small moments can have unpredictable effects in a family’s understanding of one another. The rift, all the more severe for being largely unvoiced, only worsens when David, ready to high-tail it to university in 1970, is forced into a character-building summer job with one of Robin’s plumber friends, rather than volunteer with a community theatre group; Robin wants to teach him that being a man means you can’t always choose. Among the ironies of Tyler’s reputation as a writer of domestic fiction – that loaded term – is that she’s a shrewd observer of masculinity. In another recent interview she discussed her sense that “it must be very hard to be a man – hard to become a man, when you’re young and not very sure of yourself but you’re expected to be in charge now”. When Robin explains his eagerness to get David swimming by saying that his sister Alice learned when she was four, a line from Alice’s point of view tells us that she was actually eight: “But her father hadn’t worried about it. There were advantages to being a girl and having nothing much expected of you.”The novel is cut into seven sections, each an individual third-person narrative unobtrusively tied to a particular family member’s point of view, from parents to grandchildren, generating intimacy by showing characters acting in ways we’ve been prepared for by how others see them. Each segment unfolds a decade apart, sometimes a little more, sometimes less, which contributes to the novel’s nicely relaxed sense that Tyler isn’t squeezing her characters into a design so much as just letting them be. And yet there’s nothing slack about it: witness the passing detail, casually dispensed, that Robin and Mercy married on 5 July 1940, a slyly suggestive date – the day after independence day – in a novel shaped by each character’s search for autonomy. The best and funniest chapter involves Mercy’s plan, the day after David flies the nest, to move her things bit by bit, almost imperceptibly, into a studio she’s been renting to pursue her ambitions as a painter. Potential obstacles emerge instantly: first with news that Lily is pregnant by a man who isn’t her husband, and then with the expectation of Mercy’s elderly landlord that she can look after his cat while he attends a family emergency in another state.As the story draws near the present, it’s no surprise that Tyler steers clear of the pandemic’s dystopian energies, which have proved catnip to other writers. I suspect she decided to write about it because she understood that for each of us the virus ultimately was (and is) a “small private story”. Tyler, against the trend, concentrates on Covid’s potential to occasion reunion and reconnection, as David, now a retired teacher, finds himself called on in lockdown to care for his small grandson. It spoils nothing to say that, in the bravura final paragraph, the use Tyler makes of a face mask is typical of her generous cast of mind, turning a symbol of disruption into one of great tenderness.French Braid may not upend a fan’s ranking of Tyler’s novels, in the way Redhead By the Side of the Road was a late entry, but it’s thoroughly enjoyable, and at this point any Tyler book is a gift. Funny, poignant, generous, not shying away from death and disappointment but never doomy or overwrought, it suggests there’s always new light to be shed, whatever the situation, with just another turn of the prism.

3/7/2022,"The first album I ever boughtI remember going into Woolworths and buying my first CD: a Destiny’s Child album, because I was obsessed with Beyoncé. It had all their hits. Remember the song Girl? I used to stand in the mirror and sing into a hairbrush and pretend to be Beyoncé, with Kelly and Michelle on either side of me. The song that is my karaoke go-toIt depends on how much I’ve had to drink. If I’ve had quite a bit, I sometimes think I’m good at rapping (and I’m really not). My go-to song is Super Bass by Nicki Minaj. I don’t know if that’s embarrassing or good. But it was on the radio loads when I was younger. Now it just reminds me of being in my teens, so it’s a bit nostalgic – it feels young and carefree. The song I’ve streamed the mostLast year Spotify told me that, embarrassingly, it was Let’s Go Home Together by me and Tom Grennan. Look, you’ve got to be your No 1 fan. I would have it playing on repeat in the background to get more streams. I definitely wasn’t sat back listening to myself. The best song to play at a partyIf I’m with the girls, Voulez-Vous by Abba – we all just go nuts around the kitchen island. The song I want played at my funeralI’d want a Fleetwood Mac theme: my go-to would probably be Landslide. I’d want the live version, which is really intimate. It’s a slow song but it doesn’t make me feel sad; it’s quite hopeful. The song I can’t help singingCrazy in Love by Beyoncé. I love this song, I know it lyric for lyric – even Jay-Z’s rap. It’s just one of my favourite songs of all time, in any setting, whether I’m at a party, on my own at home or in a club. The song I’d have to get up to turn offThe only kind of music that I’m not keen on is really heavy metal rock music – like when you can’t hear what they’re saying. I’m all about lyrics. Something like Slipknot, I’d have to get up or change it over. The song I secretly like but tell everybody I hateThe Greatest Show from The Greatest Showman. The whole intro, Hugh Jackman – I love singing it really loud in the car. The song that is my favouriteEverywhere by Fleetwood Mac. It just makes me so happy when I listen to it. You can’t not move to the groove of it, it’s such a chilled, happy song. If I was stuck on a desert island, I’d want that song to be on repeat.

3/7/2022,"About £2.1bn-worth of fresh fruit and vegetables is thrown away in UK homes each year because it has gone soft, mouldy or is out of date. How fresh produce is stored is key to its fate, and if you stow it in your fridge you will buy yourself more time. Apples, for example, can last for more than 100 days, much longer than in a fruit bowl. “In my house the only things that are in the fruit bowl are bananas,” says Helen White, a special adviser for household food waste at the sustainability charity Wrap. But before you start rejigging your fridge, check how cold it is. The average UK fridge is running at 6.6C when it should be below 5C. If you don’t know how to adjust the temperature, the Love Food Hate Waste website has a guide. It also has a handy A-Z of food storage. Using the freezer “hits the pause button” on food going off says White, before Food Waste Action Week, which starts on Monday. However, it is important that meat and poultry are defrosted properly before use, she says. This means getting it out of the freezer and putting it in the fridge the day before, or using your microwave’s defrost setting. The freezer is a useful tool for single-person households, who waste proportionally more than bigger ones, often because it is harder to buy the right quantities. White says you should freeze food in portions that “make sense for your household”. This should get easier because Wrap – which helps shape government policy on sustainability – is advising supermarkets to sell fruit and veg loose. A study it carried out found plastic wrappers didn’t make food last longer and forced people to buy more than they needed. You can increasingly find options in big supermarkets and although shopping takes longer, buying this way will help cut both food and plastic waste in your household. If you have overbought, all is not lost. Limp veg, including carrots, celery and broccoli, can be revived by plunging it into cold water. Soft apples can be saved by chopping them up and soaking them in juice in the fridge. Fresh herbs will last longer standing in a glass of water in the fridge. Getting a handle on the difference between the use-by and best before dates on food is vital. Use-by dates are about safety. They must be applied to food that goes off quickly and could cause food poisoning, such as fresh meat and fish or ready-to-eat salads. The product is unsafe to consume after this date. However, you can freeze it right up to and on the day. Best before is an indicator of quality. Food is still safe to eat after that date but the flavour and texture may not be as good. However, use-by dates are often found on products, such as milk and yoghurt, where a best before date would do. But things are starting to change. Morrisons recently switched to best before dates on its milk, encouraging customers to use the “sniff test” to judge if it is OK. Wrap says supermarkets should drop best before labels on most fresh produce as they are a poor guide to whether it is still good to eat (particularly if it is stored in the fridge). One in 10 people dump food based on the date; if this is you, think twice if it is something such as fruit and veg – you should be able to make your own judgment. The “look, smell, taste” logo has been adopted by about 40 brands, including Nestlé, Danone and Onken, to prompt people to check food is bad before binning it. It is part of a campaign by the food waste company Too Good to Go to end date confusion. Menu planning is a really effective way of preventing food waste, says White but she urges people not to set themselves up to fail. “Don’t design a meal plan for seven days with every meal cooked from scratch. Give yourself a day when you are going to have a takeaway or use something from the freezer.” With the country in the grip of a cost of living crisis, a bit of planning will save money. Wrap estimates that an average family with children bins 244kg of food, or 580 meals, each year, costing £730. For an individual, the estimated waste figure is 69kg, which adds up to £210. A recent poll revealed one in five consumers wasted food because they “didn’t know what to cook”. If you have run out of ideas you could order a meal kit box from Gousto, HelloFresh or Mindful Chef. They can help manage waste as the boxes contain only what you need for each dish. These days there are a growing number of apps focused on tackling food waste in and out of the home. Olio, for example, connects people with neighbours so they can redistribute spare food. Your mobile is also a handy tool for composing shopping lists or to take a picture of inside your fridge or cupboards – dubbed a “shelfie” – so you don’t buy doubles of things you’ve already got. There are also groups on social media sites where consumers exchange tips on cutting waste. If you like kitchen gadgets and think you will have time to use them, you could invest in a vacuum storage system. They can be used to preserve all sorts of foods, from avocados to blocks of cheese and pastries, by sucking out all the air around the item so it lasts longer in your fridge, freezer or cupboard. Lakeland’s Foodsaver kit, which includes a vacuum sealer pump, zipper bags and a box, costs £55, while Zwilling has a larger starter set for £80. The Netflix series Best Leftovers Ever! helps viewers see yesterday’s meal remnants through new eyes, as US home cooks battle to create the tastiest dish out of leftovers and win a $10,000 (£7,500) prize. Closer to home the Love Food Hate Waste website is full of ideas,and you can search its recipes based on foods you need to use up. Another source of inspiration is the “remix recipe cookbook” on the Too Good to Go website, which has ideas for commonly wasted foods. Leftovers can also make your life easier if you take your lunch with you to work. It is easy, for example, to scale up a pasta dish or make an extra chicken fajita for the next day. However, when using leftovers it is important to follow food safety guidelines. You should cool them quickly, then cover them and put them in the fridge. They should be eaten within two days. However, if it is rice that drops to 24 hours.",Lifestyle/Money,How to stop wasting food and save money,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/07/how-to-stop-wasting-food-and-save-money
