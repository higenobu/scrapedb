3/10/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is planning to split its stock for the first time in more than two decades in a move that will end an era of four-digit stock prices for the biggest U.S. technology companies.

That news combined with a $10 billion share-buyback authorization sent Amazon shares up as much as 11% in New York postmarket trading. As Amazon’s stock price has ballooned over the years, speculation about a potential split has been a frequent subject of speculation, which was only heightened by Alphabet’s proposed 20-for-1 split disclosed last month. Amazon conducted three splits in the 2 1/2 years following its 1997 initial public offering and then halted the practice. The topic occasionally came up at Amazon shareholder meetings but the company hadn’t taken action until now. The e-commerce giant, in an emailed statement, said the split is aimed at giving employees “more flexibility in how they manage their equity” as well as making the stock “more accessible” for average investors. Amazon’s split, like Alphabet’s, requires shareholder approval and would take effect in June if cleared. Amazon is learning from Apple how a slower-growing technology company can still be a popular investment, said Tom Forte, an analyst with DA Davidson & Co. “The stock split is kind of an old school strategy to lower your share price to stimulate interest among retail investors,” Forte said. “The stock buyback tells investors they have plenty of money sitting around and aren’t planning a big investment on building new warehouses.” Alphabet and Amazon are the last two of the five biggest U.S. technology companies by revenue that have four-digit stock prices. Amazon shares closed at $2,785.58 on Wednesday, up more than 4,000% since its last stock split in September 1999.

But Apple and Tesla Inc. have helped revive the practice after splitting their stocks in 2020. A lower stock price makes it easier for mom-and-pop traders to buy shares rather than purchase fractional stocks through their brokerage firms. It may also pave the way for inclusion in indexes such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- which is weighted by companies’ stock price and not by its market capitalization. Amazon shares have fallen 16% this year amid a broad selloff in technology stocks as the Federal Reserve prepares to raise interest rates. Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc., said the stock split is also most likely part of broader compensation changes underway at Amazon since workers feel less slighted if they receive an entire share of stock rather than a fraction of a share. “Stocks that trade for $100 or less have a bigger base of retail investors, but I don’t think that’s why Amazon is doing this,” Pachter said. “It means absolutely nothing except that Grandpa can buy little Johnny a share of Amazon stock.” (Updated with context, starting in the third paragraph.

3/10/2022,"By Bozorgmehr Sharafedin LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. ban on Russian oil and gas imports is likely to leave more cargoes at sea with no buyers, and the European Union's decision to continue imports was unlikely to make much difference to disarray in Russian oil trade, analysts said on Tuesday. U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday imposed an immediate ban on Russian oil and other energy imports in retaliation for the invasion of Ukraine and Britain said it would phase out imports through the end of 2022. The European Union did not join the ban because it is more dependent on Russian oil and gas supplies. Gas flows to Europe have so far been steady since the invasion, which Russia calls a ""special military operation"", but Moscow on Monday warned that sanctions on Russian oil could prompt it to close a major gas pipeline to Europe. Existing disruption to oil trade, caused by traders steering clear of Russian supplies due to concern they may unwittingly fall foul of sanctions imposed on Russia, is likely to worsen after the U.S. ban, traders said. Buyers will also be concerned about the kind of reputational hit that Shell took at the weekend for buying Russian oil. Shell said earlier it would stop buying oil from Russia and cut links to the country entirely. Shell's decision came days after it faced a hail of criticism for buying Russian oil at a steep discount – a transaction that two weeks ago would have been routine - underlining how Moscow's pariah status is growing even in a market it used to dominate. Russia exports around 7 million barrels per day of crude and refined fuel, about 7% of global supply. ""Redirecting trade flows takes time. It creates dislocation in the market,"" said Roger Diwan, vice president of financial services at S&P Global. ""The more you do have this type of rerouting and we don't know where the volumes are going, the physical world starts to get gummed up."" The new sanctions could leave more cargoes already on the water struggling to find buyers, analysts said. As Biden announced the U.S. ban, there were 34 cargoes of Russian oil aboard 26 ships headed to the United States, most of which was fuel oil but included 3.2 million barrels of crude, according to Houston-based energy strategist Clay Seigle, citing Vortexa data. One U.S.-based trader said that when it comes to trading Russian oil, the situation was ""getting untenable."" Goldman Sachs estimated that more than half of Russian oil exported from ports remained unsold. ""If sustained, this would represent a 3 million bpd decline in Russian crude and petroleum product seaborne exports,"" it said on Tuesday. JP Morgan estimated around 70% of Russian seaborne oil was struggling to find buyers. ""Shipping disruptions in the Black Sea have brought trade deals with the country to a virtual standstill,"" the bank said on Tuesday. BCA Research analysts also said some private companies were boycotting Russian energy, but it saw less of an impact so far. ""Estimates vary but about 20% of Russian oil exports could be affected so far,"" BCA said, adding Russian crude could still make its way to markets such as China. Kpler said there were signs a growing number of cargoes were going to sea unsold. In 2021, energy was the most imported product by the European Union from Russia, accounting for 62% of total EU imports, or the equivalent of about 99 billion euros ($108 billion).
