2/8/2022,"A British football fan who claims he was tortured and falsely imprisoned in the United Arab Emirates in 2019 while on holiday there to watch Asian Cup matches is suing the new head of Interpol. Ali Issa Ahmad was granted permission by the high court in London for legal action against Maj Gen Ahmed Nasser al-Raisi,, who has been accused of complicity in torture and was appointed as head of Interpol last November.  Raisi, who was appointed inspector general of the UAE’s ministry of interior in 2015 with responsibility for overseeing prisons and policing, is one of six senior UAE officials being sued for damages by Ahmad, 28. In May 2021, Ahmad sent letters of claim for damages to the six officials. Along with Raisi, the officials include Saqr Saif al-Naqbi, the head of state security public prosecution in Abu Dhabi; Maj Gen Faris Khalaf al-Mazrouei, commander in chief of the Abu Dhabi police; and Maj Gen Ahmed Naser Ahmed al-Dahri, second in command of the Abu Dhabi state security department. Ahmad says that while he was in UAE he was falsely imprisoned and subjected to assault and battery, intentional infliction of harm including psychiatric harm and negligence between 23 January and 12 February 2019. Ahmad’s problems started when he wore a football shirt bearing a Qatari logo when he attended a match between Qatar and Iraq at Al-Nayhan stadium in Abu Dhabi on 22 January 2019. He was approached by officials and said he received racist abuse from them and was ordered to remove the shirt. The following day, he was stopped again by officials and he says he was seriously assaulted before being detained and imprisoned. At the time, the UAE authorities issued a statement saying Ahmad had inflicted the injuries himself, and accused him of wasting police time. Ahmad said that at the time he wore the Qatari football shirt he did not know that doing so in the UAE was an offence. He says he sustained injuries to an arm and his chest, and had a tooth knocked out after being punched in the face by officials. He says he was deprived of food and water while he was detained. The high court order granted Ahmed permission late last month to serve the claim out of UK jurisdiction. Ahmad is being represented by Carter-Ruck solicitors. A letter from the UAE foreign ministry to Ahmad’s lawyers sent in June 2021, seen by the Guardian, claimed diplomatic immunity for the six officials and argued that the English courts had no jurisdiction. Ahmad said: “I am so happy that the high court has granted permission to serve my claim against the people responsible for my torture in UAE. I have suffered for the last three years. I deserve justice. Torture is painful, it has changed my life and changed how I feel emotionally. I am a victim of torture because of the football shirt I wore.” The Foreign Office lodged a complaint with the UAE authorities about Ahmad’s treatment but it is understood no response was received. The UAE embassy has been approached for comment.",News/UK news,Briton gets high court go-ahead to sue Interpol chief over torture claim,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/08/briton-gets-high-court-go-ahead-to-sue-interpol-chief-over-torture-claim
2/8/2022,"Neil Young has continued to criticise Spotify, following his departure from the platform in protest over their star podcaster Joe Rogan. In a message posted to his website, Young wrote:  To the musicians and creators in the world, I say this: You must be able to find a better place than Spotify to be the home of your art.To the workers at Spotify, I say [co-founder and chief executive officer] Daniel Ek is your big problem – not Joe Rogan. Ek pulls the strings. Get out of that place before it eats up your soul. The only goals stated by Ek are about numbers – not art, not creativity. He also encouraged readers to divest from four US banks – Chase, Citi, Bank of America and Wells Fargo – “for their continued funding of the fossil fuel damage even as the global temperature keeps climbing”. He addressed “baby boomers”, saying: “70% of the country’s financial assets are in your hands compared with just about 5% for millennials. You and I need to lead.” Young, a consistently outspoken figure during his rock career who has taken stands against US presidents Richard Nixon, George Bush Jr and Donald Trump, left Spotify last month, describing it as “the home of life-threatening Covid misinformation. Selling lies for money.” He cited Joe Rogan, host of the world’s most popular podcast, who has been widely criticised for allowing misinformation about Covid-19 to proliferate on his show. Other artists including Joni Mitchell joined his protest, with much of Mitchell’s catalogue now removed from Spotify. Young has since been pointing his fans towards streaming companies with their own ethical controversies: Amazon and Apple. He tweeted: “Amazon has been leading the pack in bringing hi-res audio to the masses, and it’s a great place to enjoy my entire catalog [sic] in the highest quality available. Thanks also to Apple Music (I LOVE APPLE) and Qobuz for sticking with my high res music.” Ek alluded to the Young-Rogan controversy in an earnings announcement on 2 February, saying: “Spotify is already implementing several first of its kind measures to help combat misinformation and provide greater transparency. We believe we have a critical role to play in supporting creator expression while balancing it with the safety of our users.” In a 1,100-word opening statement announcing Spotify’s successes, he used the word “music” only once. Later, in a question and answer session, he discussed music in more depth – and in the terms that were criticised by Young. He hailed how “we really replaced one model, right, which is you paid a la carte, which meant that typically the superfans were ones paying for music and the vast majority of people weren’t paying at all. Now we have an ecosystem where hundreds of millions of people are paying for music again across all of these subscription services.” He said the company’s next aim was “unlocking through superfans. That’s where the real dollars comes in … more flexibility, more ways for creators to use their assets, videos, engage with people, have their content show up in new unexpected ways. That will drive engagement and that, in turn, will drive people to move from casual listeners all the way up to a superfan and enables new forms of monetisation, too.” Since Young’s protest, Rogan has been further criticised for numerous uses of the N-word on his podcast, with the company removing more than 70 offending episodes. “While I strongly condemn what Joe has said ... I want to make one point very clear – I do not believe that silencing Joe is the answer,” Ek said in response.",Arts/Music,Neil Young to Spotify workers: ‘Get out before it eats your soul’,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/08/neil-young-to-spotify-workers-get-out-before-it-eats-your-soul
2/8/2022,"The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has come under fire in parliament for the government’s handling of the aged care crisis as Labor sharpens its attack on the Coalition’s pandemic response. In the first question time of the parliamentary year on Tuesday Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, targeted the government’s response to Covid outbreaks in residential aged care, demanding Morrison admit responsibility for the crisis that has seen about 600 aged care deaths linked to Covid this year.  The aged care sector has been reeling from the impact of the Omicron wave of the virus, with a quarter of all shifts going unfilled during January and concerns that carers have been left to work in dangerous conditions with a lack of government support for testing and personal protective equipment. Albanese, who attempted to suspend standing orders to debate the government’s response and to call for the aged care services minister Richard Colbeck to be sacked, said that Morrison needed to take responsibility. He also demanded Morrison apologise to aged care residents and their families “for his failure to listen and act on countless warnings about the continuing crisis in aged care.” “The aged care crisis is indicative of the way this prime minister and this government approaches every issue – it’s always too little, too late and it’s always the case that they ignore a problem until it becomes a crisis,” Albanese said. “The problem is … their distractions, their dishonesty and their disunity is stopping them looking after the interests of Australians, particularly those people in aged care,” he said. In response to questions, Morrison said that the pandemic had taken a heavy toll around the world and in Australia, but said only 10% of those who had passed away in nursing homes had died with the virus. More than 4,000 people died in aged care homes in January. “It has been an incredibly tough time for those who have been working in those facilities, with the onset of Omicron, and it has been incredibly tough for those families who had to say goodbye to loved ones over that period of time,” Morrison said.“At every moment of this pandemic, we have sought to provide every single support we possibly can to ensure we can be assisting both the workforce and those who are engaged in providing that care.” Morrison said that Australia had one of the lowest mortality rates in the world, and accused Labor of trying to politicise the pandemic. “He (Albanese) has constantly been negative when it comes to the serious challenges that our country has faced,” Morrison said. “He can seek to downplay Australians’ efforts, in how we’ve come through this pandemic, with his constant negativity, snarling and growling, but the facts are these: on each occasion, we have worked to address the situation that we have had before us.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In the Senate, Labor senator Kristina Keneally said the situation in the aged care sector was an “utter disaster” as she singled out Colbeck for criticism. “Disease is running rampant through facilities, too few staff to care for those living there, our greatest generation left unwashed and without food. Have you no shame, have you no responsibility, have you no care?” Keneally said. Colbeck, who was criticised for attending the cricket rather than front a Covid committee, acknowledged there had been “some issues”, but defended the government’s response. “The Labor party can play their dirty, nasty personal politics but they have no plan,” Colbeck said. The Coalition begins the parliamentary fortnight under pressure on a number of fronts. It faces internal division over the religious discrimination bill which Morrison has prioritised for the current sitting fortnight, but which the Tasmanian Liberal MP Bridget Archer has said she will not support. Morrison has also faced calls for the government to get on with introducing its Commonwealth Integrity Commission bill after the attorney general, Michaelia Cash, suggested there was no time to fulfil the election promise made before the last election. Morrison’s character has also been targeted after the revelation of text messages sent by Liberal colleagues that questioned his trustworthiness, including from his deputy, Barnaby Joyce. There are just seven sitting days in the current session of parliament, before budget week in late March.",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison faces question time grilling over government response to Covid aged care crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/08/scott-morrison-faces-question-time-grilling-over-government-response-to-covid-aged-care-crisis
2/8/2022,"Friday is a momentous day. CBeebies, the BBC’s dedicated channel for viewers aged six and under, will be 20 years old. There aren’t many television companies around the world that would devote an entire channel to bright, educational, inclusive output – but it isn’t until you have kids that you realise what a lifesaver CBeebies is. It is an utterly trustworthy place, full of wholesome stories and thoughtful messages. Among the wild west of YouTube and streaming platforms, it is an outpost where you know your children will always be looked after. CBeebies has produced so much wonderful television that it is impossible to list it all, but here is a countdown of the 20 best shows from the past two decades. Happy birthday, CBeebies!  This show about a monkey and her son features a series of songs performed by Lauren Laverne. For the most part, the songs exist to remind parents that they are not alone in their mundane struggles – there is one about waking up, one about tidying up, one about the backbreaking effort of getting a child out of the house. And then there is a lovely lullaby waltz called Go to Sleep. Almost without exception, every new parent has been caught off-guard by Go to Sleep. Maybe it has been a hard day. Maybe you are incapacitated with exhaustion. Whatever the reason, there will be a time when Go to Sleep will come on unannounced and reduce you to rubble. Most parents have cried to Go to Sleep at one point or another. It is less a song and more a cruise missile to the chest. It should probably be banned. Hosted by Dr Radha Modgil, Feeling Better was a 2018 series designed to help children cope with the emotions they encounter while growing up. It was tremendously effective, too. Every episode saw Dr Radha attend to a puppet who was experiencing new and complicated feelings, by putting them into context, reassuring the puppet that feelings are normal, then singing a song about it. It was the sort of show that would struggle to be made anywhere else. There are a couple of stages to watching In the Night Garden. The first comes when you are introduced to its army of nonsense characters – Igglepiggle, Makka Pakka, the Tittifers, the Ninky Nonk – and assume you have been concussed. But sit with it for a few episodes and In the Night Garden unfolds with a beautiful logic. Designed to appeal to a toddler’s mind, this is often the first CBeebies show a child will fall in love with. One of CBeebies’ launch offerings, Balamory was a live-action show about a small Scottish fishing community, shot in the village of Tobermory, on Mull. A bright, otherwordly series, Balamory was more traditional than the shows CBeebies would later produce, but it was a sensation nonetheless. It still is: 20 years on, the comedian Miles Jupp still hasn’t shaken his association with the show (he played Archie, the clueless aristocrat who lived in a bright pink castle, if you were wondering). A series based on the titular age-old problem. Your grandfather was the beloved British actor James Bolam. In a procession of staggeringly inopportune moments, he kept putting on a magical shrinking cap, becoming the size of a mouse and speeding around the house, bringing toys to life like a cackling miniature poltergeist. This show was delightful, but, honestly, the grandfather was a handful. The closest your children will get to Fun House or Finders Keepers. A fun, silly, nautical gameshow where young contestants are pitted against an uptight captain and her idiotic crewmates. You could write a thesis on the fact that, since the protagonists are pirates taking on the authoritarian might of the British navy, Swashbuckle is a way to indoctrinate children into the ways of guerrilla warfare. But you shouldn’t, because it would be stupid. Possibly the best-known CBeebies show, and certainly the starriest, Bedtime Stories ends each day on the channel. A celebrity will appear and read gently from a picturebook close to their heart. The level of celebrity Bedtime Stories attracts is amazing; Tom Hiddleston, Tom Hardy, Kristin Scott Thomas, Dolly Parton, James McAvoy and Elton John have all read stories. It isn’t always the biggest stars that shine brightest, however – I have a soft spot for Nadiya Hussain’s telling of My Little Star. Tweenies predated CBeebies by three years, but heavy rotation in the ensuing years and its enormous cultural footprint means it deserves its spot. The series followed four young (but adult-sized) children as they played, sang, learned and (often, in the case of Milo) threw apocalyptic tantrums that were quickly followed by needy apologies. The Tweenies also released several singles. Their first was called No 1 and went to No 5. Their last, bewilderingly, was a cover version of the 1995 song Have Fun, Go Mad from the Dunston Checks In soundtrack. Twirlywoos is a lesser-known effort from Anne Woods’ Ragdoll Productions – also known for Rosie and Jim and Teletubbies – but it is easily one of the best. Each episode happens across two parts. In the first, the Twirlywoos (a family of four bulbous seafaring creatures with propellers on their heads, along with their pet urchin) travel into the real world and create havoc for a succession of well-meaning but dimwitted humans. Once some lives have been ruined, the Twirlywoos head back to their boat and learn lessons about prepositions. Everything about Twirlywoos is impossibly charming; it deserves much more recognition than it gets. The most delightful show CBeebies ever made. In every episode, lovely, twinkly Bernard Cribbins boards his boat and tells a lovely, twinkly story to his adorably old dog. Not a huge amount happens in the stories – they usually revolve around the local community, which includes Freema Agyeman and Helen Lederer, and younger kids may be put off by the slower pace at first – but it is a great world in which to immerse yourself. Better yet, several episodes were written by Russell T Davies. A wildly inventive series of three-minute shorts, Dipdap revolved around a simply animated character forced to overcome the obstacles created for him by a line drawing. There was something beautifully timeless about Dipdap – it was a 21st-century show with the feel of a 70-year-old Warner Bros cartoon. Don’t be surprised if children are still discovering it anew several generations from now. Justin Fletcher has a whole array of CBeebies shows to his name – there is Something Special, if you need something soothing, or Justin’s House, if you want to feel as if you are trapped in a hellish liminal soft play centre for ever – but Gigglebiz is probably the best showcase of his talents. An all-out sketch show that appeals to children and parents, Gigglebiz earns its place for never pandering to its young audiences. Also, it is a sketch show. Do you know how rare those things are these days? Maddie Moate is one of CBeebies’ all-time breakout stars – and her ascent began here. Maddie picks a thing she wants to learn more about – soft-play cushions, say, or toilet rolls – and visits the factory where they are made. Deep down, it is an update of those old Sesame Street production-line segments, but Maddie’s wide-eyed enthusiasm for everything she sees really sells it. In which Sid Sloane and Rebecca Keatley dress up in the uniforms of various professions then travel magically into their world. By itself, Let’s Play would be a perfectly diverting television show, but what pushes it over the edge is the dizzying number of characters Keatley and Sloane play. There is one episode, set in a courtroom, in which Keatley simultaneously plays a claimant, a defendant, a witness, a member of the jury, two lawyers and an usher. It is astounding – Kind Hearts and Coronets told in 20 minutes. People should have thrown flowers at Keatley’s feet as the credits rolled. Like Justin Fletcher, Andy Day has an entire squadron of CBeebies shows. Andy’s Dinosaur Adventures is the most popular and the best. The conceit is simple – Andy travels back in time to interact with various prehistoric animals, by digitally inserting himself into Walking With Dinosaurs footage – but Andy is a bright and charming guide throughout. The manner in which he travels back in time, involving a magic clock in a museum that Andy seems to remember only when anyone mentions the word “time” to him, defies logic to such an extent that it gives adults something to pedantically overanalyse during the long days of parenthood. A godsend. A show so staggeringly effective that they use it in schools. Prior to Numberblocks, shows about maths would be about characters doing maths. In Numberblocks, the characters are the maths. They throw themselves together and pull themselves apart to demonstrate mathematical principles in a satisfyingly visual way. This means that children are able to latch on to relatively challenging ideas with ease. If I had grown up with Numberblocks in my life, I would be much less stupid as an adult. Rastamouse is a stop-motion animation about the crimefighting adventures of a Rastafarian mouse who also performs in a reggae band. While it might not be the most culturally accurate show CBeebies has ever made – Benjamin Zephaniah criticised the characters’ West Indian accents – it is one of the most loved. The characters are beautifully designed, the humour is happily offbeat and, as someone who has suffered through more CBeebies Spotify soundtracks than most, I can gladly attest that the music isn’t at all insufferable. Of course Teletubbies is up there. For 25 years, it has been the archetypal BBC kids’ show – which is odd, given that it’s about a group of infantile custard-drinking aliens who blunder around under the watchful gaze of a baby trapped in the sun. But this loose relationship with adult logic is exactly what makes Teletubbies so special. Point a preschooler – any preschooler – at an episode of Teletubbies and they will be transfixed. The creation of Teletubbies was a watershed moment when it came to presenting information to children. The fact that it is still so popular underlines how important it is. Joe Brumm’s Bluey isn’t just one of the best children’s television shows of all time; it is one of the best shows full stop. A show about a family of Australian blue heeler dogs, Bluey is in reality a series of short films, each with its own distinct mood and soundtrack. There is Takeaway, a story about a father trying to entertain his children, set in one location and told in real time. There is Sleepytime, scored to Holst’s The Planets, in which a young girl travels through space in order to gain the bravery to sleep alone. There is Movies, which includes a big Disney-style musical number. There is Camping, which involves a genuinely ostentatious time jump to show how the main character is faring in adolescence. There is Flat Pack, in which, no joke, the characters roleplay evolution, from prokaryotes all the way to a posthuman utopia. Bluey is absolutely breathtaking television and it deserves to be watched by everyone. If anyone tries to tell you that children’s television was better in the good old days, sit them down and make them watch Hey Duggee. Grant Orchard’s animated series about a dog who runs a cub-scout-style youth group might well be the best kids’ show ever made. It is fast, it is funny, it is sweet, it is educational, it is visually distinct, it throws adult references into the mix with wild abandon (one episode is an Apocalypse Now riff, for crying out loud). And, Lord, is it inventive. In one episode, the characters become puppets; in another, ceramic mugs. To watch Hey Duggee is to watch a television programme struggle to constrain the scope of one man’s limitless imagination. It is utterly astonishing and much, much better than anything you watched as a child.",Arts/Television & radio,"‘Absolutely breathtaking TV’: 20 years of CBeebies, from surreal Teletubbies to the beauty of Bluey",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/08/absolutely-breathtaking-tv-20-years-of-cbeebies-from-surreal-teletubbies-to-the-beauty-of-bluey
2/8/2022,"At first glance, The Justice of Bunny King looks like it comfortably slots into a familiar category of earnest, sincere dramas: woman fights social services to get her kids out of foster care. That’s a bit of a movie cliche, and there are a couple of scenes here that you may feel like you’ve seen before. But first-time feature director Gaysorn Thavat brings real depth and layers of emotional intelligence to the issues, and her film is unexpectedly funny. It’s a match for the Australian actor Essie Davis, whose role as Bunny King is her best since The Babadook. Bunny works as a “squeegee bandit”, washing windscreens on a busy stretch of road in Auckland, New Zealand. She is sofa-surfing, staying with her sister’s family while saving for a rental deposit , as she needs secure accommodation to get her children back. Looking at Bunny’s jar of shrapnel, you sense it’s going to be an uphill struggle. But she is someone who walks on the sunny side of life. That in itself is a bit trite: the relentless optimist. It’s a measure of Davis’s performance that Bunny seems absolutely authentic; a real-feeling woman not a character study.  The story of how her children – five-year-old Shannon (Amelie Baynes), who is disabled, and 14-year-old Reuben (Angus Stevens) – were taken into care, emerges painfully. It involves domestic violence, and what’s clear is that the justice system has been viciously unfair to Bunny. At contact sessions with the kids she is affectionate and excited, almost childlike herself. But she has a self-defeating streak of anger, lashing out at social workers. The strength of the writing is in portraying Bunny’s reality, allowing us to wonder – like the social workers – whether she really is a reliable parent. This is thoughtful film-making, though I didn’t quite buy into the explosion of drama at the end.  The Justice of Bunny King is in cinemas 11 February.",Arts/Film,"The Justice of Bunny King review – a funny, thoughtful parenting drama",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/08/the-justice-of-bunny-king-review-essie-davis
2/8/2022,"Scott Morrison, along with other Australian political leaders, has apologised for the “terrible things” that happened in parliament workplaces and acknowledged a culture of bullying, abuse, harassment “and in some cases even violence” built up over decades. Morrison’s apology on Tuesday followed a landmark review by Australia’s sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins, in 2021 into federal parliament’s culture. The Jenkins review, which recommended a significant overhaul of the workplace culture, found one in three staffers interviewed had been sexually harassed.  The inquiry was constituted after a former government staffer, Brittany Higgins, alleged she was raped by a colleague after hours in a Parliament House ministerial office in March 2019. Morrison was widely criticised for his perceived mishandling of the aftermath of Higgins’ allegation which triggered a broader #MeToo reckoning in the Australian parliament and led to public rallies. Morrison’s standing with female voters took a significant hit. The prime minister attempted to recover from the damage by introducing more workplace support for political staff and by reshuffling his cabinet to amplify a female “perspective” within the conservative Coalition government. On Tuesday, the prime minister used a formal statement of acknowledgement in the lower house to apologise directly to Higgins and praise her “courage”. “Parliament can’t be a place of cruelty,” Morrison said. “Nor can it be a place where incivility towards each other is somehow proof of some strength.” The prime minister said the federal parliament needed to adhere to the highest workplace standards – and be “a place where any Australian can aspire to work and know they can work safely”. The sentiments were echoed by the leader of the National party, Barnaby Joyce, the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, the leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, and by members of the crossbench. Albanese paid tribute to Higgins, who watched proceedings from the visitor’s gallery in parliament. The Labor leader said she had “torn through a silence that has acted as the life-support system for the most odious of status quos”. But there was controversy the evening before the formal apology was delivered. Higgins and other former staffers who had campaigned for an overhaul of the toxic culture in the preceding 12 months were initially not invited to attend parliament for the statement. A surge in Covid infections has restricted public access to the building. But an invitation was issued at the last minute. The Jenkins review made 28 recommendations. The first was that Australia’s political leaders make a public statement to acknowledge “the impact of the misconduct on individuals and the lack of action taken in the past” and “outline the institutional leadership commitment to change with shared accountability for progress”. The government has signalled it will introduce legislative changes recommended by Jenkins in the remaining parliamentary sitting weeks before Australians go to the polls likely in May. The Jenkins review found gender inequality in the political ecosystem was a key driver of bullying, sexual harassment and sexual assault within commonwealth parliamentary workplaces. It found that power imbalances and the misuse of power were among “the primary drivers of misconduct”. A survey undertaken to inform the review found 37% of respondents in parliamentary workplaces had personally experienced bullying and 33% had personally experienced sexual harassment – with 1% experiencing an actual or attempted sexual assault. 84% of people who experienced sexual harassment did not seek support or advice. The report recommended a new code of conduct for parliamentarians and their staff to help normalise employment conventions. Jenkins said the new code should address current legal requirements that prohibit bullying, sexual harassment, sexual assault and workplace discrimination.",News/Australia news,Australian PM apologises for ‘terrible’ parliamentary culture after Canberra’s #MeToo reckoning,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/08/australian-pm-apologises-for-terrible-parliamentary-culture-after-canberras-metoo-reckoning
2/8/2022,"Words matter. They are all you have as a politician. They are your only weapon of choice. We wage war and we broker peace with words. We inflame or we calm. That is why it is so important to deploy them carefully and responsibly. Unfortunately, a cynic knows how to cast aspersions, make an insinuation and whisper sweet nastiness in the public ear – preferably without anyone noticing. But it’s a dangerous business. The poison you pour in the well may be intended for your enemy, but it can all too easily poison your friends and all around you too.  This is my problem with Boris Johnson’s foul slurs against Keir Starmer. Johnson knew precisely what he was doing when he falsely claimed Starmer failed to prosecute Savile when he was director of public prosecutions. He had discussed it with his advisers beforehand. He knew he was up against the wall, and he desperately wanted a distraction. He was advised against it, in the strongest terms. He was told it was irresponsible and dangerous. He was leaching off the conspiracy theories of the very hard-right in the UK and the US and giving dangerous elements in society succour. It would provide an authoritative platform for the very nastiest characters in the body politic. It was bound to inflame feelings – and yesterday we saw precisely what it could do, when an angry mob lambasted Starmer as he returned to parliament from the Ministry of Defence. The fact that the braying crowd recited the prime minister’s vicious slurs would have counted as a victory for Johnson. He had achieved his aim. They were ventriloquising him. He had incited them. There was malice aforethought. Perhaps the most cynical aspect of this is the fact that Johnson seems to have no thought for Savile’s victims – whose representatives have universally condemned him – nor is he doing anything to ensure that present and future generations of child abusers are brought to justice. He doesn’t care about child abuse. The victims are just collateral in his insidious ploy. It is not the first time Johnson has done this. He loves inflammatory language. It is his modus operandi. When he is in trouble you can see him reach for a more exorbitant metaphor, a sharper quip, a harsher turn of phrase. Back in 2019 he was endlessly accusing everyone who disagreed with him of “surrender” and “betrayal” and being a “traitor”, deliberately whipping up anger. When the Labour MP Paula Sherriff took him to task for it in the Commons and begged him to moderate his language because of the daily death threats she and other female MPs were receiving, he launched another attack at her. She was almost in tears, but he said he had never heard such “humbug” in all his life. Then the predictable (and intended) result was that all the demons of hades were unleashed upon her on social media. And so it has been this week. As minister after minister has defended the PM in ever more outlandish fashion, criminal and unsavoury factions have taken to social media to back him up. We know how this plays out. We have seen the same tactics in the US. It ends up on the steps of Congress. But it’s not yet too late to stop that fatal trajectory here. It will require, as a very minimum, that the PM apologises fully and with genuine contrition, withdraws the remarks and condemns those that repeat them. But I suspect he can’t do that. It’s not in his nature. He’d far prefer to smirk, like Muttley the cartoon dog, at the success of his cunning plan. That’s why he really will have to go – and Tory MPs will have to do the deed sooner rather than later. Chris Bryant is the Labour MP for Rhondda",Opinion/Opinion,Boris Johnson incited a violent mob.
