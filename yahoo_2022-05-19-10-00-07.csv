TikToker Jillian Orr (@jillianoreo) is a recent college graduate and LGBTQIA+ activist. Orr, who is bisexual, recently showed her pride by fabulously revealing a rainbow flag lining the inside of her gown when receiving her diploma from Brigham Young University, a conservative university owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Buried in debt? A financial expert weighs in on how to get back on track In a video Orr posted to TikTok, she explains over footage leading up to her bold statement that “at BYU, it’s against the honor code to be in a homosexual relationship.” Over a close-up shot of a rainbow flag being sewn to the inside of her graduation gown, Orr explains that if the school finds out that students are in a homosexual relationship or even just holding hands, “there are severe consequences.” Orr goes into further detail, claiming that BYU will threaten to expel students and rescind their degrees. Ultimately, “students are afraid to be who they are, so they hide out of fear until they get out,” Orr notes, over footage of her getting fitted for her graduation gown. Get Jordyn Woods's makeup look with these products: “I will not hide,” Orr declares over a shot of her turning around to show off the finished product. As she grabs the opening of her graduation gown for the big reveal, the clip cuts to Orr on graduation day, proudly displaying the rainbow flag sewn inside, while the words, “I will be seen,” appear on screen. The video cuts to a photo of Orr on stage at graduation, joyfully showing her gown’s rainbow flag interior “in front of the entire school” on the stadium’s jumbotron. Orr closes the video with two photos of her looking like a proud college graduate with a future as bright as her rainbow flag. While comments on Orr’s video have been turned off, there’s no doubt that her confidence in showing the world who she is will positively impact individuals of all ages.

5/19/2022,"Some books carry cautions lest they offend sensitive readers. Jake Adelstein’s came with an actual trigger warning. “Any publisher handling this book should have experience dealing with the yakuza,” ran one publisher's internal report on his memoir Tokyo Vice. “Serious security measures should be taken.” It wasn’t an idle threat. A few years before, Adelstein – a crime reporter for Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan’s national newspaper – had gotten wind of a racket involving Goto Tadamasa, the head of Yamaguchi-gumi, the largest and most violent of Tokyo’s mafia families. Goto discovered Adelstein was on his case and dispatched his henchman to rattle the reporter: kill the story, or we’ll kill you. Adelstein didn’t drop it. But he heeded the warning enough to employ an ex-yakuza boss as his bodyguard and driver for five years. “I always took it seriously,” he tells me over Zoom from his home in Japan. “His [the driver’s] salary always got paid on time, even if it meant I was eating ramen at the end of the month!” The first Japanese publisher he approached declined to take on Tokyo Vice. But it eventually appeared in 2009. An account of the 12 years Adelstein spent on the crime beat for the Yomiuri, it’s hard-boiled gem, taking in murder, suicide, self-immolation and – this being Japan – oodles of freaky, snap-on-your-rubber-gauntlets sex. But it’s also a moving coming-of-age tale. Adelstein arrived in Tokyo in the late 1980s as a gawky Midwestern college student, but through dedication – and a dash of self-mythologising – reinvented himself as a hard-charging investigative journalist, the first Westerner to pass Yomiuri’s ferocious entrance exams. His reporting, too, is a glimpse into a vanished era of journalism: pavements are pounded, sources strong-armed and contacts cultivated amidst the smoke-and-sake funk of late night dive bars. It looked a lot more fun before Twitter. Now his memoir has been adapted by HBO. Scripted by the Tony-award-winning playwright JT Rogers, with Ansel Elgort playing Adelstein, it is masterfully done. The cinematography renders Tokyo a neon-drenched maze, while the Elgort captures Adelstein’s charismatic cockiness and vulnerability in this strange, seedy world. In tone, it feels like a lost Michael Mann flick. (Mann, in fact, directed the first episode.) But it’s hard to overstate the unlikeliness of the real-life Adelstein. In conversation, he has an ebullient, Adam Sandlerish energy, spilling stories with the ease of a seasoned bar-propper. He grew up in McBaine, a tiny town outside Columbia, Missouri – “they used to say: ‘You never lose your girlfriend, you just lose your turn’” – and a fight in high school put him on to karate and, from there, an interest in Zen Buddhism. At college, he went on an exchange programme to study literature at Tokyo’s Sofia University – and never came back. In Tokyo, he taught English to a Zen Buddhist priest, living in a garret above the temple. And he helped pay the rent by translating kung-fu films into English and – another hazy vista in his extensive hinterland – giving Swedish massages to bored housewives. Most of all though, Tokyo whispered reinvention. “I thought, ‘Nobody knows me here, no-one knows my history of f***-ups’,” he remembers. “In my first year of college, I fell down a staircase and I was in a coma for a day. After that, my childhood memories were pretty scattered – so I couldn’t remember my childhood, and I was speaking a language which was completely alien. It was a very refreshing experience.” After college, he applied to join the Yomiuri, Japan’s most prestigious newspaper with a circulation of 12 million – at the time, the world’s largest title. To get in, he had to pass their gruelling four-hour Japanese language exams and a steeplechase of interview panels. The questions were unusual; at his final interview, one of the editors asked Adelstein, who is Jewish, whether he could work on the Sabbath and eat sushi. Oh, and whether Jews controlled the world economy. “I don’t think it was anti-Semitism, so much as ignorance,” he explains. “The Japanese love conspiracy theories. But I made a joke of it, and it worked out okay.” Still, the Yomiuri was a culture shock. As a rookie reporter, Adelstein had to adapt to the paper’s feudal corporate hierarchy, churning out busywork – typing up birth announcements, sports reports and scrap-booking – to keep up with its 12 daily editions. “We were tired all the time,” he remembers. “We didn’t feel like journalists, we felt like slaves. We weren’t even treated like real people. If someone wanted to get your attention they would just shout ‘first year’ and gesture at you.” Salaryman life had more outlandish rituals too. Berserker drinking sessions were the norm, and junior staff were expected to wait on their seniors. Adelstein even tells me how he knocked his boss flat at his first Bōnenkai, a no-holds-barred end of year party. “He had a good kick,” he chuckles. “But, you know, Japan is a very masculine culture and people get drunk and do stupid things.” It was around this time that Adelstein first met a yakuza. He remembers: “We went to his office in the red light district. It looked like a real estate agency in this very nondescript block. I was struck by how eloquent he was. He looked like a business man, wearing a very nice suit with these tattoos just poking out from his sleeves. I got to ask lots of questions about the yakuza, and he continued to be a good source for years.” Adelstein’s interactions with the yakuza and the cops were governed by giri, an honour-bound system of back-scratching that kept favours – and information – circulating around Tokyo’s underworld. A yakuza might inform on a rival gang to gain advantage over them; a cop might let slip about a potential raid to keep a friendly reporter on side. But burning sources, and exposing the delicate choreography of criminality, law enforcement and the media, was an excommunicable offence. What strikes you reading Tokyo Vice is the poised theatricality of the yakuza. In the 1990s, when Adelstein was entangled with them, they were in their full pomp, with more than 90,000 members, split between 22 officially recognised groups. They had glitzy headquarters and branded business cards. Their wealth underpinned Japan’s booming financial and real estate sectors; films, fanzines and tabloids glamorised their lifestyles and charitable largesse. And, at least on the face of it, they were bound by a strict code of conduct – no harassment of civilians, no dealing drugs – which was published on the walls of their headquarters. For the yakuza foot soldiers, discipline was brutal: a severed pinkie finger as punishment for insubordination. Evolving from trade unions in the post-war chaos of the 1940s, the yakuza held a precarious position in Japanese society. The public feared and looked down on these tattooed mobsters, whilst avidly following their exploits. And the authorities tolerated their presence – yakuza killings of rival gang members were rarely investigated, and the police would inform them of upcoming raids so “evidence” could be neatly boxed up and ready for the press call. “The Japanese have a schizophrenic attitude to them,” Adelstein notes. “They would like to believe there’s these people outside the system who are working for the greater good. But essentially most of them are sociopaths.” This sense of outsiderdom helped Adelstein gain their trust. “Nearly half of them are Korean-Japanese – they’re like the Jews of Japan!” he says with a laugh. That is, until he dug too deep on one investigation. In 2004, following evidence that a high-profile loan shark had laundered millions of dollars in Las Vegas casinos, he uncovered an odd trial: yakuza bosses had been travelling to the US, under the radar of the FBI, to have liver transplants. (In the hard-boozing world of the yakuza, a knackered liver is a badge of honour.) One of these bosses was Goto Tadamasa. After Adelstein published his story on this connection, Goto was kicked out of the Yamaguchi-gumi. Linked to the murder of a real-estate agent, he fled to Cambodia and became a Buddhist priest – a surprisingly common second career for ex-yakuza in a country where the statute of limitations for crimes is only five years. As well as threatening Adelstein, Goto published his own account of the affair. Adelstein asked him to retract passages about him, but stopped when Adelstein's lawyer – the famed prosecutor Igari Toshiro – was found dead in the Philippines. Toshiro and Adelstein’s work, though, helped galvanise Japan’s parliament to pass rigorous anti-yakuza laws. Goto is now back in Japan, and is trying to produce an English-language account of his biography. Yet Adelstein no longer believes he is a threat. His ex-yakuza bodyguard died of a heart attack during the pandemic. And he hasn’t hired another one. “Most yakuza are in their fifties now,” says Adelstein. “It’s a dead-end job, and it’s very hard to leave. There is no future for them. They’ll never again have the same power.” In fact, the unique atmosphere of Tokyo Vice has largely been scrubbed clean. Tokyo’s red-light districts have been gentrified, and the yakuza’s hold on the city has been cracked. Tokyo Vice feels valedictory – there’s an undertow of melancholy, mourning even, to Adelstein’s prose. He burned his youth, health and, eventually his marriage, for the job. And in 2011, he himself was diagnosed with liver cancer. (He made a full recovery.) He quit the Yomiuri in 2006. The last straw was a particularly nasty human trafficking case. Afterwards, he worked for the US State Department trying to combat the trade and published three other books alongside Tokyo Vice. Reading his own words now, feels like “printed PTSD,” he reflects. “There’s a lot of youthful idealism in there. But also a huge amount of pain and loss. It’s a terrifying thing to know someone wants you dead. People I’ve known have gone missing, colleagues have been beaten so badly they could barely walk.” Perhaps most painfully, though, Tokyo Vice recounts how Adelstein’s close friend and mentor, Hamaya, died by suicide. One of the paper’s few female senior reporters, she was demoted after she annoyed editors for championing the rights of the mentally-ill. It was a blow she couldn’t weather. Her loss still weighs on Adelstein. Living now, he writes in the book, involves always “thinking about the friends that you suspect you might be able to save”. There have been more recent difficulties. Since the adaptation was released in the US, some articles have questioned Tokyo Vice’s credibility. One interviewee quoted in The Hollywood Reporter said: “I don’t think half the stuff in the book happened.” In response, Adelstein dumped a series of documents purportedly verifying its claims on Twitter. And he’s bullish about the criticism when I speak to him. “I really wish they had taken the time to do the research,” he says. “It wouldn’t be hard to verify it – it’s all here. I’ve got a whole folder here [hefting a weighty black ring-binder into shot] which proves it. Most of it is in Japanese, but the lack of really basic research baffles me.” Come what may, he hasn’t slowed down. As a freelance reporter, he has published exposes into Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the links between former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and organised crime. He wrote about the LDP's cover-ups of Japan’s ageing nuclear infrastructure, and its contribution to the 2011 Fukushima reactor disaster, as well as how yakuza money was integral to Japan’s bid for the Olympics. “You have to remember Abe’s grandpappy was a yakuza,” he explains. “I seriously think the LDP has done more damage to this country than the yakuza.” A follow-up to Tokyo Vice is due out next year. And he is working on a podcast series about missing people. Would he ever consider retiring? “Sometimes, I think I might give it up and lead a life as a humble Zen Buddhist priest,” he laughs. “But I believe in life, we only encounter the injustices we’re meant to correct. You can only fight lies with truth.” He pauses, then grins. “It doesn’t feel like work – it feels like a calling.” Tokyo Vice is on Starz Play now. It will be broadcast on the BBC later this year",World/The Telegraph,The real Tokyo Vice: how a Westerner took on the yakuza and lived,https://news.yahoo.com/real-tokyo-vice-westerner-took-140135465.html
5/19/2022,"Customers flooded a Hawaiian restaurant in Austin, Texas, after a TikTok announcing its permanent closure went viral. Hawaiian BBQ and poke bowl restaurant Poke Bay will permanently close its doors after five years of business following the University of Texas at Austin’s acquisition of land on Guadalupe Street to expand the school’s campus. Restaurant owners Paul and Priscilla Song are left with no choice but to close their establishment by the end of this month. The Songs’ emotional journey went viral on TikTok after their daughter, Angelica Song, voiced her frustration and called on people to support her parents in the final weeks of their business. “Unfortunately, UT Austin bought out the building my parents are tenants at,” Angelica explains in a video uploaded to her TikTok account on May 9. “Essentially, they are just kind of kicking them out and not helping them out with relocation, or a new place.” More from NextShark: Wisconsin Sandwich Shop's 'Veggie Sub Banh Mi' Sparks Widespread Disgust “I mean, technically, UT Austin doesn’t owe my parents anything, but it just sucks that a school that has so much money and resources can’t even help my parents out even a little bit,” she added. “Especially when my parents have catered multiple faculty programs. A lot of the UT Austin faculty members are friends with my parents.” Angelica goes on to explain that Poke Bay was so successful that her parents received multiple offers to buy the rights to the restaurant. However, their conversations came to a halt due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Angelica’s parents were slowly starting to bounce back from the pandemic before the land that houses Poke Bay and four other businesses was purchased by UT Austin in December 2021.

After Angelica’s TikTok went viral, her parents welcomed an influx of customers. Paul and Priscilla also took to TikTok to express their gratitude for the people who came to support their business.  “We weren’t really prepared to be this busy today,” Paul says in a video posted to his daughter’s TikTok account on May 11. “If we made some mistakes or we’ve run out of items that we should have had, we apologize.

5/19/2022,"By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON (Reuters) - One military analyst had a brutally frank message for viewers of Russian state television: The war in Ukraine will get much worse for Russia, which is facing a mass mobilisation supported by the United States while Russia is almost totally isolated. Since President Vladimir Putin ordered the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, Russia state media - and especially state television - have supported the Kremlin's position. Few dissenting voices have been given air time. That appeared to have changed on Monday night when one well-known military analyst gave a blunt assessment to Russia's main state television channel of what Putin casts as the ""special military operation"". ""You should not swallow informational tranquilizers,"" Mikhail Khodaryonok, a retired colonel, told the ""60 Minutes"" talk show on Rossiya-1 hosted by Olga Skabeyeva, one of the most pro-Kremlin journalists on television. ""The situation, frankly speaking, will get worse for us,"" said Khodaryonok, a regular guest on state TV who gives often candid assessments of the situation. He said that Ukraine could mobilise 1 armed million men. Khodaryonok, a military columnist for the gazeta.ru newspaper and a graduate of one of Russia's elite military academies, cautioned before the invasion that such a step would not be in Russia's national interests. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands of people, displaced millions more and raised fears of the most serious confrontation between Russia and the United States since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Khodaryonok and Skabeyeva could not be reached for comment. SENSE OF REALISM The war has also shown the post-Soviet limits of Russia's military, intelligence and economic power: despite Putin's attempts to bolster his armed forces, the Russian military has fared badly in many battles in Ukraine. An encirclement of Kyiv was abandoned and Russia has turned its focus instead towards trying to establish control over Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. The West has supplied billions of dollars of arms to Ukrainian forces. Losses are not publicly reported but Ukraine says Russian losses are worse than the 15,000 Soviets killed in the Soviet-Afghan war of 1979-1989. ""The desire to defend one's motherland in the sense that it exists in Ukraine - it really does exist there and they intend to fight to the last,"" Khodaryonok said before he was interrupted by Skabeyeva. The biggest strategic consequences of Russia's invasion to date have been the unusual unity of the United States' European allies and bids by Sweden and Finland to join the U.S.-led NATO military alliance. Khodaryonok said Russia needed to see the reality. ""The main thing in our business is have a sense of military-political realism: if you go beyond that then the reality of history will hit you so hard that you will not know what hit you,"" he said. ""Don't wave rockets in the direction of Finland for goodness sake - it just looks rather funny,"" he said. Russia, he said, was isolated. ""The main deficiency of our military-political position is that we are in full geopolitical solitude and - however we don't want to admit it - practically the whole world is against us - and we need to get out of this situation.""

5/19/2022,"The group that posted a viral nude video of Rep. Madison Cawthorn is targeting Rep. Lauren Boebert next. The American Muckrackers PAC has ""interesting information"" about Boebert, a co-founder told Insider. The information deals with financial matters, he said. The group that posted a viral sexually explicit video of a nude Rep. Madison Cawthorn with another man in bed is now focusing on Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert for its next takedown, Insider has learned. ""I think we're gonna go after Lauren Boebert in Colorado in a similar way,"" David B. Wheeler, cofounder of the American Muckrakers PAC, told Insider. ""I think we're gonna engage in that race pretty quickly."" While Wheeler is a Democrat, his co-founder is unaffiliated, and the group counts some Republicans among its advisors. Wheeler said he's received ""interesting information"" about the Republican firebrand, whose primary against GOP state Sen. Don Coram is on June 28. The information is ""certainly not as salacious as some of the Cawthorn stuff."" It deals, instead, with financial matters, he said, declining to disclose more details. A spokesperson for Boebert did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Last year, the Associated Press reported that the freshman lawmaker failed to disclose her husband's income during her campaign, in violation of ethics and campaign finance laws. She revealed that her husband made nearly $1 million over 2019 and 2020 as a consultant for an energy firm. Former President Donald Trump endorsed Boebert in December as ""a fearless leader, a defender of the America First Agenda, and a fighter against the Loser RINOs and Radical Democrats,"" shortly after she was rebuked for making Islamaphobic comments about Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. Wheeler's PAC, also known as FireMadison, played a key role in exposing damaging information about Cawthorn, who lost his Republican primary in North Carolina to Chuck Edwards on Tuesday. The group revealed Cawthorn's attempt to take a gun through the Asheville Regional Airport last year. It also filed a complaint accusing Cawthorn of violating US House ethics rules by allegedly providing free housing and gifts to a staff member. Cawthorn responded to the nude video released by the PAC, saying ""I was being crass with a friend, trying to be funny. We were acting foolish, and joking. That's it."" In Colorado, where Boebert is running for re-election, unaffiliated voters can participate in either the Republican or Democratic primary. Wheeler said he plans to focus on targeted messages through texting and social media at unaffiliated women. ""We have procured domain names and Twitter handles and we are in discussions with various groups in Colorado that collaborate,"" he said. Those names will be, ""Fire Boebert,"" and he said the landing page will likely be up this week.

5/19/2022,"An angler recently reeled in a rare and “freaking scary” fish after casting his hook into a murky Texas marsh, photos show. The scaly creature’s striking look, jet black from tail to toothy tip, took the fisherman and his guide by surprise, according to a post by Lotus Guide Service. “Well … (we) found out melanistic gar do exist,” said the May 16 post, sharing photos of the fish whipping and thrashing against the fishing line. Long-established residents of Texas waterways, the prehistoric and prized alligator gar is typically brown or olive in color. But seemingly every inch of the one recently hooked in the “southeast Texas marsh” is dark black, save for the impressive teeth and pale gullet revealed by its open jaws. Though harmless to humans, alligator gar are fierce enough in appearance and in name to inspire fearful myths about them — and this strange variation is particularly stirring to some, even those familiar with the fish. “Freaking scary,” one commenter said. “Caught alligator gar growing up in Louisiana … put up a hell of a fight.” “I like this, looks hella mean,” another said. “Them thangs look deadly,” another read. Melanism, a genetic anomaly that causes darker fur, hair, skin or scales, is known to occur across the animal kingdom, though it is exceptionally rare, McClatchy News reported. How rare is melanism? Rare enough that experts generally lack enough data to offer exact figures. But there are reports of other gars with the condition having been caught or killed in the U.S. While the black alligator gar has some locals vowing to keep their toes out of the water for the foreseeable future, others were simply impressed. “Man that’s gorgeous,” a commenter said. Some were so impressed that, had they been the one to catch the gar, they said they’d have it mounted in their man cave or trophy room for all to see. The gar is safe from that fate, at least for now.

5/19/2022,"By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON (Reuters) -Russia on Wednesday said it was using a new generation of powerful lasers in Ukraine to burn up drones, deploying some of Moscow's secret weapons to counter a flood of Western arms. Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2018 unveiled an intercontinental ballistic missile, underwater nuclear drones, a supersonic weapon and a laser weapon. Little is known about the specifics of the new laser. Putin mentioned one called Peresvet, named after a medieval Orthodox warrior monk Alexander Peresvet who perished in mortal combat. Yury Borisov, the deputy prime minister in charge of military development, told a conference in Moscow that Peresvet was already being widely deployed and it could blind satellites up to 1,500 km above Earth. He said there were already more powerful systems than Peresvet that could burn up drones and other equipment. Borisov cited a test on Tuesday which he said had burned up a drone 5 km away within five seconds. ""If Peresvet blinds, then the new generation of laser weapons lead to the physical destruction of the target - thermal destruction, they burn up,"" he told Russian state television. Asked if such weapons were being used in Ukraine, Borisov said: ""Yes. The first prototypes are already being used there."" He said the weapon was called ""Zadira"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy mockingly compared news of the lasers to the so-called wonder weapons that Nazi Germany unveiled in a bid to prevent defeat in World War Two. ""The clearer it became that they had no chance in the war, the more propaganda there was about an amazing weapon that would be so powerful as to ensure a turning point,"" he said in a late night video address. ""And so we see that in the third month of a full-scale war, Russia is trying to find its 'wonder weapon' ... this all clearly shows the complete failure of the mission."" Almost nothing is publicly known about Zadira but in 2017 Russian media said state nuclear corporation Rosatom helped develop it as part of a programme to create weapons-based new physical principles. The invasion of Ukraine has illustrated the limits of Russia's post-Soviet conventional armed forces, though Putin says the ""special military operation"" is going to plan. Borisov's remarks indicate Russia has made significant progress with laser weapons, a trend of considerable interest to other nuclear powers such as the United States and China. Using lasers to blind satellites was once a fantasy from the realm of science fiction, but the United States, China and Russia have been working on variants of such weapons for years. Besides the benefit of burning up drones, blinding reconnaissance systems has a strategic impact too as satellites are used to monitor intercontinental ballistic missiles carrying nuclear weapons. Borisov said he had just returned from Sarov, which is a centre of Russia's nuclear weapons research. He said a new generation of laser weapons using a wide electromagnetic band would ultimately replace conventional weapons. ""This is not some sort of exotic idea; it is the reality,"" Borisov said.

5/19/2022,"By Tom Balmforth and Jonathan Landay KYIV/KHARKIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Even as the Kremlin prepares to take full control of the ruins of Mariupol city, it faces the growing prospect of defeat in its bid to conquer all of Ukraine's eastern Donbas because its badly mauled forces lack the manpower for significant advances. Russian President Vladimir Putin may have to decide whether to send in more troops and hardware to replenish his dramatically weakened invasion force as an influx of modern Western weaponry bolsters Ukraine's combat power, analysts say. Russia's forces are unlikely to be vanquished quickly even if no major new troop deployment materialises, setting the stage for the four-week-old Battle for the Donbas to grind on. ""I think it's either going to be defeat with the current force posture, or mobilise. I don't think there is any middle ground,"" said Konrad Muzyka, director of the Poland-based Rochan consultancy. He and other analysts said Russia's invasion force was facing unsustainable troop and equipment losses, and that their window for a breakthrough was narrowing with Ukraine now bringing Western heavy artillery into the fray. ""Time is definitely working against the Russians. They're running out of equipment. They're running out of particularly advanced missiles. And, of course, the Ukrainians are getting stronger almost every day,"" said Neil Melvin of the RUSI think-tank in London. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday that ""everything is going to plan ... there's no doubt that all the objectives will be achieved,"" the RIA news agency reported. But in an unusually critical commentary on Russia's main television channel this week, a prominent military analyst said Russians should stop swallowing ""informational tranquilizers"" about what Putin calls a special military operation. With the increasing flow of U.S. and European weapon supplies to Ukrainian forces, ""the situation will frankly get worse for us,"" said Mikhail Khodaryonok, a retired colonel. AZOVSTAL FALLS Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in a failed drive to capture the capital, Kyiv. It then withdrew to focus on a ""second phase"" announced on April 19 to capture the south and all of the Donbas, a chunk of which has been held by Moscow-backed separatists since 2014. Russia retained its land corridor in southern Ukraine, but was hampered by Ukrainian troops who held out against massive bombardments for 82 days in Mariupol's Azovstal steel works before ending their resistance this week. Meanwhile, Putin's forces pressed against Ukraine's battle-hardened, fortified positions in the east, while trying to cut them off in a massive encirclement by advancing south from the Ukrainian town of Izium. Around a third of the Donbas was held by Russia-backed separatists before the invasion. Moscow now controls around 90% of Luhansk region, but it has failed to make major inroads towards the key cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk in Donetsk in order to extend control over the entire region. ""I'm deeply skeptical of their prospects"" of conquering all of the Donbas, said Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military with CNA, a U.S. nonprofit research and analysis organisation. ""They're dealing with a dramatically weakened force, probably substantially reduced morale. There's a weak desire by officers to keep trying to prosecute offensives and the Russian political leadership on the whole seems to be procrastinating even as it's facing the strategic defeat itself,"" he said. Muzyka said Russia appeared to be switching its focus in Donbas and had shifted battalion tactical groups eastward after failing to break the Ukrainian defences in Donetsk. ""They couldn't push through from Izium so they moved to Sievierodonetsk and Lyman, possibly with the goal of trying to encircle Ukrainian forces around Sievierodonetsk and Lyman. Whether or not this occurs is an entirely different matter,"" he said. Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the Russian chief of army staff, visited the front this month in an apparent bid to iron out problems, but there is no evidence he succeeded, said Jack Keane, the chairman of the Institute for the Study of War in Washington. ""That offensive has indeed stalled,"" he said. To the north of the Donbas, Kyiv has mounted a counter-offensive near the city of Kharkiv in northeast Ukraine that has cleared Russian forces from shelling range of the country's second biggest city and even reached the border in one place. Muzyka said Ukraine might secure a significant part of its border with Russia north of Kharkiv this week. But Ukraine will not be able to replicate that quick advance in the Donbas where Russia's troops are much more densely concentrated. ""It's going to be a hard fight. There's going to be a hard fight and potentially a long fight. The Russian military hasn’t done well on the offensive, but it doesn't rout or surrender easily either,"" said Kofman. 'ARTILLERY WAR' The influx of Western heavy guns, including scores of U.S. - and some Canadian - M777 howitzers that have longer range than their Russian equivalents, could give Ukraine an edge in a war that has revolved around artillery duels. ""The Ukrainians are starting to outrange the Russians. That means they are able to operate without the threat of counter-battery fire from the Russians,"" said Muzyka. ""Don't get me wrong, the Russians still enjoy overall artillery superiority in terms of numbers, but I'm not sure if the same goes for the quality now... This is an artillery war."" Muzyka and Kofman said that even if Putin does send more troops, such a move could take months to organise. ""It's very clear they're preparing for at least some kind of measures to call up men with prior service experience. But right now, from what I can tell, Putin is just kicking the can down the road and letting the situation within the Russian military actually get worse,"" Kofman said. ""For now,"" he said, ""this is looking like the Russians' last offensive.""

The school allegedly found Shaan to be at fault. He received a 3-day in-school suspension as punishment, while the aggressor only received one day. When his parents requested for a reassessment using the viral video as evidence, the school said that there will be no changes made. The School Resource Officer refused to file a citation because the school administration allegedly asked that the incident not be documented as there have already been many bullying complaints. “Coppell ISD is aware of a video circulating on social media showing an incident at Coppell Middle School North involving a physical altercation between two students,” Coppell School Superintendent Dr. Brad Hunt wrote in an email. “Bullying, both verbal and physical, as well as physical acts of aggression are never acceptable and do not align with who we are at CISD and our core values.” More from NextShark: 36-Year-Old Woman Calls 911 ‘Repeatedly’ Because Parents Shut Off Her Phone Sonika Kukreja, Shaan’s mother, started a petition on Change.org to spread awareness and to call on the school to take more action against her son’s aggressor.

It will become one of the top petitions on Change.org if it reaches 300,000 signatures. “Due to lack of support from the Coppell ISD and Coppell PD to correctly handle this assault, we are demanding that the aggressor be removed from my son's school immediately,” Kukreja wrote. “Shaan should never have to take a class, interact, or pass the hallways with this aggressor ever again. Shaan should be able to continue his school experience, friendships and extra-curricular activities with zero worry of ever having to cross paths with this student again. He does not feel safe.”  “Our goal is to bring awareness to the bullying and assault problem in schools everywhere,” she added. “All children deserve to be safe at school.

5/19/2022,"Putin often became frustrated with Trump over his lack of knowledge on big issues, Fiona Hill said. ""He had to keep explaining things, and Putin doesn't like to do that,"" Hill said. Hill said this factored into Putin's decision to invade Ukraine during the Biden administration. Russian President Vladimir Putin often became frustrated with President Donald Trump over his lack of knowledge on geopolitical issues, Fiona Hill said, adding that this played into Moscow's decision on the timing of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. One of the reasons Putin invaded Ukraine with President Joe Biden in the White House was that he expected the US to ""sue for peace"" and thought it would be better to deal with Biden than trying to negotiate with someone like Trump, whom the Russian leader had ""to explain everything to all the time,"" Hill, who served as the top Russia advisor on the National Security Council under Trump, said Tuesday at a Chicago Council on Global Affairs event. ""He thought that somebody like Biden — who's a transatlanticist, who knows all about NATO, who actually knows where Ukraine is, and actually knows something about the history, and is very steeped in international affairs — would be the right person to engage with,"" Hill said. ""You could see that he got frustrated many times with President Trump because he had to keep explaining things, and Putin doesn't like to do that,"" Hill said, adding: ""Even though he loves to be able to spin his own version of events, he wants to have predictability in the person that he's engaging with."" A number of Trump's former advisors have said the ex-president had a poor grasp of global affairs. The former national security advisor John Bolton, for example, said Trump once asked whether Finland was part of Russia. Similarly, Trump's former White House chief of staff Gen. John Kelly also once said Trump ""doesn't know any history at all, even some of the basics on the US,"" says Hill's new book, ""There Is Nothing for You Here: Finding Opportunity in the Twenty-First Century,"" which was published last year. In the book, Hill writes that Trump's meager comprehension of international affairs was a ""major liability"" for US national security.

How to avoid panic buying in an ultra-competitive housing market There’s nothing more disappointing than whipping out a Post-it note for an important reminder, only for it to unstick from the surface and get lost. Apparently, however, this isn’t a matter of product malfunction so much as it is one of user error. TikToker Ali Abdaal recently learned the correct way to use a Post-it note and shared how in a quick video. Watch this Brooklyn bedroom go from drab to fabulous in one day: “I was today years old when I realized I’ve been using Post-its all wrong,” Abdaal wrote in the caption. “You’re probably using Post-it notes wrong,” he explained in the video. Here’s how you use them properly. Normally we rip off Post-it notes like this. But the problem is that it naturally wants to unstick itself.” Instead, he suggested, placing the Post-it note pad sideways and pulling the note off that way. “Then it sticks properly,” he said. Because the note isn’t bent upward, it’s less likely to peel off and unstick. The useful tip racked up over 300,000 views on TikTok. “Are we just doing everything wrong?” someone joked. “Might not be the biggest thing but I just learned something new,” another wrote. “I’ve been doing this forever.

5/19/2022,"A South Carolina man, who has been in prison for seven years for a deadly Rock Hill fire that killed his baby brother, was denied parole Wednesday. However, even with that denial, it appears under state law that Jacob Matthew Morgan could be released from prison as early as December. At that point he would have served about half of a 15-year sentence. Morgan, now 24, was denied a chance at release Wednesday by the unanimous vote of a panel of the S.C. Parole Board after a video conference hearing, said Valerie Suber, associate deputy director of the S.C. Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services. The parole board had gathered in Columbia. Morgan appeared in the parole hearing from MacDougall Correctional Institute in Berkeley County. It was his second parole hearing after he was denied in May 2021. Joshua Hill, Morgan’s younger brother, was 14 months old when he died in the March 2015 mobile home fire in York County, just outside Rock Hill. Morgan was babysitting at the time. The incident captured national attention. Morgan pleaded guilty in 2016 under what is called an Alford plea, a negotiated agreement with prosecutors where Morgan did not have to admit guilt but accepted there was evidence against him that would likely convict him. The agreement came after he had been indicted on charges of first-degree arson and murder and faced up to life in prison. Morgan was convicted in 2016 on charges of third-degree arson, involuntary manslaughter and child neglect. Morgan did not admit guilt Wednesday. Parole Board chairman Henry Eldridge, of Tega Cay in York County, said Morgan was convicted of a serious charge and asked Morgan how he felt about it. “Not a day goes by that I don’t regret my brother’s death,” Morgan replied to Eldridge via teleconference. “I would gladly change places with him.” Eldridge then asked Morgan why he became involved in the deadly incident. Morgan replied that he was in the wrong place at the wrong time, but did not elaborate. Morgan acknowledged in the hearing after a statement from Eldridge that he has received mental health treatment while in prison. Eldridge asked Morgan if he would work if released from prison to live with his mother. “I can work if it’s necessary,” Morgan said. “I have to be responsible for my own life.” The hearing ended with no more questions. Eldridge told Morgan the parole board would vote and Morgan would be advised of the vote results. The vote was released shortly afterward. Parole board hearings are public meetings. The Herald, a part of McClatchy company, obtained permission from South Carolina parole officials to watch Wednesday’s hearing. There were no other speakers at the hearing. In 2021 Morgan’s mother spoke as an advocate for him to be released. The 2016 guilty plea and sentence, later discussions about Morgan and the case, were covered by local media and other outlets such as CNN Headline News, the Daily Mail from the United Kingdom, and regional media in both Carolinas. Police and prosecutors said in court in 2016 that Morgan set fire in at least two places in the mobile home, and did not call for help despite having a cellphone. Prosecutors said in 2016 that Morgan had set a fire two weeks before the fatal incident. Police and prosecutors said in court that Morgan lied to cover up the crime and knew that his brother would die in the fire. Sixteenth Circuit Solicitor Kevin Brackett said Wednesday, after Morgan was denied parole, that Morgan should serve his full sentence. There was no question the fatal fire was set intentionally and a child died, Brackett said. “It is appropriate that Mr Morgan serve his full sentence in this case,” Brackett said. Morgan’s lawyer from arrest through the 2016 guilty plea, 16th Circuit Public Defender B.J. Barrowclough, said Morgan deserves parole. “It is extremely disappointing that Jacob Morgan was denied parole again today,” Barrowclough said in a statement to The Herald. “When he went to prison he was a gentle and soft-hearted young man who had endured a difficult childhood. A quick review of his incarceration on the SCDC website shows he’s had no disciplinaries. His crime, even from the State’s perspective, was one of recklessness, not evil intent. And I know the victim’s family, which is his family, want him home because they never wanted him incarcerated in the first place. To deny this young man parole is an indictment of the parole system.” Morgan was sentenced to 15 years in prison for all three convictions, court records. The S.C. Department of Corrections Web site shows that Morgan is eligible for release from prison in December. His release date is Dec. 23. Chrysti Shain, spokesperson for the corrections department, said South Carolina law allows inmates to reduce their sentences by earning work and educational credits. In the 2021 parole hearing, Morgan said he earned a General Equivalency Diploma to graduate high school while in prison.",U.S./Rock Hill Herald,Rock Hill SC man again denied parole after conviction in fire that killed baby brother,https://news.yahoo.com/rock-hill-sc-man-again-202439343.html
5/19/2022,"Can you put a dollar amount on what it means to be wealthy in the U.S.? An annual survey asks Americans to do just that, and this year, $2.2 million is the magic number. That's according to the annual Modern Wealth Survey from Charles Schwab, which also finds people believe that an average net worth of $774,000 is what it takes to be financially comfortable. The report, which surveyed 1,000 Americans ages 21 to 75 in February 2022, asked respondents a range of questions about their personal finances, including the factors influencing their savings and investment decisions. The average net worth needed to be considered wealthy and to be financially comfortable both rose from last year's survey. In 2021, Americans said they needed $624,000 in net assets to live comfortably, while it would take $1.9 million to be rich. That said, the averages are still lower than they were before the COVID-19 pandemic, likely because many people are focusing less on hitting a specific number and more on their overall goals, financial and otherwise, says Rob Williams, managing director of financial planning, retirement income, and wealth management at Charles Schwab. ""People are concerned about other things besides the balance in their portfolio and in their investment account,"" says Williams, including their physical health and overall stability. The average net worth of U.S. households actually isn't so far off from Schwab's survey: It stood at $748,800 in 2019, according to the most recent Survey of Consumer Finances by the Federal Reserve. But that's skewed by the richest households. The median net worth for U.S. households is $121,700, per the Fed. And as other reports have found, many U.S. households have very little or no savings at all. With little saved for emergencies or retirement, a number like $2.2 million—or even $774,000—might seem like an impossible benchmark to reach. But Williams says this doesn't have to be the case. Ultimately, each household should calculate its own wealth target and make an individualized savings plan. What one person or family needs isn't the same as another. “A plan is really just saying, ‘This is what’s important to me, this is what I need to save and invest for next year, in five years, 10 years from now,’” says Williams. Once you have some idea of a target, the most important thing you can do is start saving—regardless of the amount you put away. Five dollars is better than nothing, even if it doesn't seem at first like it will add up to much. Putting even a little bit of money away consistently is especially important when building a retirement account, as most Americans will be on their own to fund their golden years, says Williams. ""No matter how much money you have, get started and stay disciplined,"" he says. ""You’ll look back and say, ‘Goodness, those small steps really built up over time.’ You’ll find yourself in a position where you can make a lot more choices than you could before."" Once you start saving, make it an automatic ritual. Oftentimes, watching your savings accrue will provide the momentum to keep saving more and more, even if you're just starting out or well below your target number, says Williams. Keeping the long game in mind is critical, especially in a rocky market like we're seeing right now. Building wealth, for most people, takes decades of dedicated investments. Though investing money in assets that are on a losing streak can seem self-defeating, a down market is ""an opportunity to be saving and investing more,"" says Williams—and getting more for your money. ""If you’re investing for net worth, it takes time to get there,"" he says. ""It's good to be aspirational, but get started and don’t get overwhelmed by trying to get to a certain number in a day or a week.""

5/19/2022,"“Mommy, help me,” 9-year-old Shalom Guifarro begged as she lay dying in her family’s Brooklyn apartment, after enduring hours of abuse — allegedly at the hands of the same person the child wished would save her. The heartbreaking details of the little girl’s final hours were detailed by prosecutors at her mother Shemene Cato’s arraignment in Brooklyn Criminal Court Tuesday, where she was ordered held without bail. Cato, 48, is charged with murder, manslaughter, assault and other crimes in her youngest daughter’s death over a missing tablet Sunday morning. Little Shalom was hiding from her infuriated mother, who spent two hours walloping her and her 13-year-old sister with an extension cord and bashing them with a broom inside their Lincoln Place apartment, prosecutors said. But the spot Shalom sought as a safe haven from her maniacal mother turned out to be the opposite. “The defendant lifted up the bed, attempting to pull the child out from underneath,” said Assistant District Attorney David Ingle in court. “The bed dropped on Shalom... The bed fell onto her head.” After Cato dropped the bed on her daughter, the child was still, prosecutors said. “Shalom could not stand up, was non-responsive and kept saying, ‘Mommy, help me,’” said Ingle. Finally, around 1 p.m. Shalom’s older sister called police. Shalom suffered multiple blunt force injuries to her head and body, and bled to death internally, the city Medical Examiners Office said. Cato shuffled into court Tuesday in pajama bottoms and pink flip flops and remained silent, fidgeting with her hands cuffed behind her back. The accused monster mom showed little emotion other than hanging her head low throughout the proceedings. The killing shocked members of the Crown Heights community, who regularly saw Cato and her two daughters out and about. Rev. Pedro Torres, who runs No Longer Bound Ministries just around the corner from the apartment, said he saw them almost every day and never noticed anything out of the ordinary. “She [Cato] was regular. She would have a conversation, we would talk,” Torres said, recalling that she asked him how she could improve her credit. “Everybody says she was always verbally abusive with the child. I never saw that. I always saw her with the child like a mom, taking care of her kids,” Torres said. He remembers a playful, happy, Shalom running around — a child he once gifted with a doll on Christmas. “She really had no worries in the world. Always smiling and funny,” he said. “I remember the time when I gave her the doll. The next day she saw me and she gave me a hug. She was very appreciative,” he said.",U.S./NY Daily News,"9-year-old Brooklyn girl cried ‘Mommy, help me,’ as she died after hours of beatings and abuse: prosecutors",https://news.yahoo.com/9-old-brooklyn-girl-cried-233900085.html
5/19/2022,"CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — The wife of a New Hampshire man accused of killing her co-worker after he discovered they were texting — and then forcing her to behead him — denied shooting him Wednesday, and testified that both were brutally assaulted by her husband in the hours leading up to the death that night. Britany Barron, 33, testified at her husband's first-degree murder trial that he choked and punched her and eventually put his gun into her mouth. “You know that you’re going to die tonight, right?” she testified her husband, Armando Barron, said in September 2020, not long before the two left the house to go to the park where he allegedly used her phone to tell the co-worker to meet her there. “Don't do anything stupid or the girls are going to walk into something (expletive) gruesome,"" she testified he said as they were leaving. He had sent the couple's three young children to go to their grandmother's home next door. On the way to the park, he read the texts aloud, striking her after finishing each one, she said. Britany, who asked a prosecutor in the Keene courtroom to address her by her maiden name, Mitchell, also testified that just a week earlier, she had told Armando she no longer loved him and wanted a divorce. When he heard that, he grabbed her throat and started choking her, saying, “Are you serious?"" She denied early in her testimony that she was the one who shot Jonathan Amerault, as a defense lawyer alleged during opening statements Tuesday. She pointed to her husband as the shooter. Barron pleaded not guilty to killing Amerault, 25. He acknowledged in court Tuesday that he had struck Britany, broke her nose, attempted to strangle her, and kicked Amerault in the head. Prosecutors allege that Armando Barron, 32, used his wife's cellphone to lure Amerault to the park just north of the Massachusetts state line the night he discovered the texts, beat and kicked Amerault and and tried to force his wife to shoot him. She refused. He also forced her to stand on his neck and slit his wrists, they said. Armando Barron forced Amerault into the back of the victim's car and told Britany to get into the driver's seat, she testified. At one point, he left them alone, she said. There was a machete inside and Britany testified that Amerault told her to pick it up and kill her husband, but she said no. “I wasn't going to test him,"" she said. She said Armando Barron eventually got into the car and shot Amerault three times. Barron had his wife drive the car back to their home in Jaffrey to pack some supplies, and he followed in the couple's car. They then headed 200 miles north (322 kilometers) to a remote campsite, with Barron talking on the phone with her throughout the trip, she testified. There, Armando Barron allegedly forced her to cut off Amerault’s head and bury it and wrap the body in a tarp. He left her to dispose of the body and returned home, she testified. “He said that we needed to cut off his head so that there would be no dental records of the body,"" Britany testified, saying she used a saw brought from home. She testified that they both destroyed evidence. The body was found by New Hampshire Fish and Game officers in a swamp after they found Britany at the campsite, where she was not allowed to camp. Britany testified that she and Amerault got to know each other better while working on a project in the days leading to his death and communicated via texting and social media apps. One afternoon, they drove to a nearby park after work and talked. She described him as kind, sweet and funny. “I said I couldn't offer anything more than friendship,"" she testified, and later gave him a quick kiss when he returned her to work so she could get her car.

5/19/2022,"Surveillance footage from China showed an 8-year-old boy violently stomping on the head of a 2-year-old girl to steal the snacks she was carrying. On May 5, the boy, named Zhuang, entered the toddler’s home in Haikou where she was playing alone, according to a Weibo post from Owl Video. He allegedly demanded that the toddler hand over her snacks, but when she refused, he began to beat her. In the surveillance footage, the boy is seen kicking the 2-year-old to the ground before violently stomping on her head. He attempts to stomp on the toddler again as she tries to stand up, but he runs away after the girl’s grandfather yells out. The toddler suffered head trauma and four loose teeth which required two months of treatment. More from NextShark: Bay Area Doctor Cannot Eat or Drink Because of the Lack of Masks Zhuang’s parents initially denied their son’s involvement in the attack until they saw the surveillance footage. When the toddler’s parents confronted the boy, he responded, “I beat whenever I want.” In an open letter at the end of the Weibo video, the 2-year-old’s mother stated that their family has never had issues with Zhuang’s family. They reportedly refused to apologize or express any remorse. Zhuang’s parents also allegedly said they cannot afford compensation and begged the toddler’s family not to report the attack to the police. The toddler’s parents reported the attack to the police after Zhuang’s parents continued not to apologize. The case is now under investigation.

5/19/2022,"President Vladimir Putin has long tried to project an image of abundant good health. Ukrainian officials claimed in May that he is hiding that he is ""very ill"" with cancer. Rumors of health problems and secret surgery have followed the Russian president for decades. Speculation about President Vladimir Putin's health reached fever pitch on Sunday after former MI6 Russia spy Christopher Steele indicated the Russian president could be seriously ill. Speaking to Sky News, Steele said Putin's health could be a factor in the unfolding invasion of Ukraine. Since invading Ukraine Putin has had shaky media appearances and has been described — with varying reliability — as suffering from everything from Parkinson's disease to dementia. Putin has for decades cultivated an image of virile masculinity at peak fitness — but an investigation by independent Russian media outlet Proekt alleged that this was only possible with significant deception. Most specifics about Putin's health are almost impossible to confirm. His top spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has repeatedly denied any issues. Medical professionals have refused to give weight to the rumors, as Deutsche Welle reported, arguing that accurate diagnoses can only be made by in-person examinations. Here is a timeline of moments when Putin's health has come into question. In fall 2012, Reuters cited three government sources saying Putin had back trouble and would need surgery soon. The Kremlin denied this, but after Russian newspaper Vedomosti said that Putin had hurt himself while hang-gliding, Peskov said the trouble was due to ""an ordinary sporting injury"" in which Putin had strained a muscle, as The Atlantic reported. By the end of December 2012, Proekt alleged that Putin was wearing a corset and significantly limiting — or even skipping — sit-down engagements due to likely back problems. The outlet cited unnamed Russian officials for the information. On November 4, Russia's National Unity Day, the Kremlin limited itself to still photos of Putin's appearance at a ceremony in Red Square, according to Proekt. However, footage posted by religious leaders in Moscow showed the president with a slight limp. By matching the check-in dates of medical specialists with Putin's travel schedule, Proekt found that Putin was regularly accompanied by at least five doctors in these years — a number that would later swell to 13. They included an ENT specialist, an infectious diseases specialist, a staff rescuscitologist, and a neurosurgeon, the outlet reported. Between November 25 and December 1, Putin appeared only in pre-recorded meetings, Proekt reported. Meanwhile, 12 specialists suddenly checked in at the Sochi hospital near his residence, including his personal doctors, neurosurgeons, and a rehabilitation specialist, according to Proekt. Putin, an avid ice hockey player, almost somersaulted when he crashed to the ground during a match in Sochi at the age of 64, CNN reported. According to Proekt, the player Pavel Bure had crashed into him. After this, an orthopedic traumatologist known to regularly treat the president checked in to a hospital just outside Putin's residence, Proekt reported. Between August 8 and 16 that year, the president disappeared from public view, with oncologist-surgeon Evgeny Selivanov, Proekt reported. The presence of an ENT doctor suggested a thyroid issue, the outlet said. Selivanov joined Putin's medical entourage, flying to his location 35 times in the space of four years, the outlet reported. Only ENT doctors have seen him more often, the outlet said. Putin disappeared from view from February 12 to 1 in 2018, just one month before polling day, Proekt reported. Acknowledging his canceled events, Peskov said Putin has a cold, per ABC News. A COVID-19 outbreak among presidential staff in September last year led Putin to self-isolate for two weeks. Ten days later, he denied any ill health after he was seen coughing during a televised meeting. Soon after, The New York Times reported that Putin was imposing increasingly stringent isolation procedures on anyone due to see him face-to-face — including isolation for two weeks prior and the requirement to pass through a disinfectant tunnel. This came weeks after Russia lifted most of its COVID-19 measures nationwide, the paper reported. By February 2022 — as world leaders implored him not to invade Ukraine — Putin was having his in-person meetings at an extraordinarily long table. Bizarre footage of Putin meeting with his defense minister on April 21 showed the president gripping the edge of the table, looking uncomfortable and fidgety, as Newsweek reported. Along with his bloated appearance, the video prompted a welter of tabloid speculation — none of which was confirmed — that he could be suffering from the effects of steroid treatment or Parkinson's disease. —max seddon (@maxseddon) April 21, 2022 Further unverified rumors were emanated from an anonymous Telegram account claiming to be a former Kremlin insider. In early May, New Lines Magazine obtained a recording of an unnamed Russian oligarch saying that Putin ""is very ill with blood cancer."" The oligarch, who did not know he was being recorded, went on to criticize Putin's invasion of Ukraine, saying that ""we all hope"" he dies, and that ""the problem is with his head."" Ukrainian intelligence chief Maj. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov told Sky News on May 14 that plans to overthrow Putin were in motion within Russia, and that the 69-year-old was in a ""very bad psychological and physical condition and he is very sick."" Putin is sick with cancer, Budanov said. He denied trying to propagate that idea or propaganda to advantage Ukraine.

5/19/2022,"OROVILLE, Calif. (AP) — A tree trimmer in rural Northern California was found guilty in a series of throat-slashing attacks that left three people dead, prosecutors announced Wednesday. A jury in Butte County on Tuesday found Ryan Scott Blinston, 37, guilty of murder, attempted murder and arson, the Tehama County District Attorney's office said. Blinston, of Oroville, faces a mandatory term of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Blinston was working for a tree-trimming service when in 2020 he returned to the clients’ homes in Butte and Tehama Counties, north of Sacramento, after the work was completed and slashed the throats of the residents, prosecutors said. In May 2020, he attacked Loreen Severs, 88, of Los Molinos in Tehama County and her husband, Homer Severs, 91. Homer Severs survived the attack but died that December of an unrelated illness, authorities said. Blinston was also charged in the killing of Sandra George, 82, and an acquaintance, Vicky Cline, 57, both of Oroville in Butte County. He was also charged with torching Cline’s car. Police in the Sacramento suburb of Roseville say two men engaged in an altercation outside a Hampton Inn early Monday morning, leaving one dead. A 21-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder. The District Attorney for Tehama and Butte counties agreed to combine the charges and have the case tried in Butte County, prosecutors said. Blinston was arrested before dawn on June 14, 2020 — about a week after Cline vanished — by a Butte County sheriff’s SWAT team that had tracked him to a motorhome in heavily wooded and isolated Brush Creek, where authorities planned to arrest him on suspicion of burning Cline’s car, prosecutors said. The team approached the motorhome and heard the muffled screams of a man inside and loud banging on the outside of the motorhome. The banging turned out to be Blinston attempting to get into the motorhome with a hatchet, prosecutors said. Blinston ran into the woods, refused to drop the hatchet and was captured after a short struggle and the use of a stun gun and pepper spray, authorities said. Blinston had met the 50-year-old owner of the motorhome earlier and then stayed over because he told the man he was afraid to leave after dark because of bears, the resident told authorities. The man said he was sleeping when he awoke to find Blinston attacking him with a knife, prosecutors said. Blinston slashed his neck but the man said he was able to kick him out of the motorhome and lock the door. A medic treated the seriously injured man and he was airlifted to a hospital, they said. The SWAT team may have saved the man’s life, prosecutors said, because the isolated area had no cellphone service and it was unlikely anyone would have heard the man’s cries for help. Prosecutors didn't mention a motive for the crimes other than to say robbery was not a motivating factor.",U.S./Associated Press,California tree trimmer guilty in deadly throat-slashings,https://news.yahoo.com/california-tree-trimmer-guilty-deadly-233436761.html

5/19/2022,"* Top commanders not surrendered yet - rebel leader * Russia: 959 Ukrainian fighters surrendered since Monday * Surrendered Ukrainians to face court - rebel leader * Fate of fighters is unclear By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON, May 18 (Reuters) - Top-ranking Ukrainian commanders have not yet surrendered from the labyrinth of bunkers and tunnels below the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol, the leader of the Russian-backed separatist region of Donetsk said on Wednesday. As the most devastating siege in Russia's invasion moves towards a finale, nearly 1,000 Ukrainian fighters who barricaded themselves into the tunnels have so far given themselves up to Russian and pro-Russian forces since Monday. Russia's defence ministry said that in the past day 694 Ukrainian fighters - including members of the Azov regiment - had surrendered, including 29 wounded. It was unclear if the top commanders would leave the plant, or possibly even fight a last mortal battle with the Russian forces they regard as occupiers of their motherland. ""There are no commanders of the highest level (among those who surrendered) - they have not left,"" said Denis Pushilin, head of the breakaway Donetsk People’s Republic which was officially recognised by President Vladimir Putin just three days before the invasion of Ukraine. ""That is - so far,"" Pushilin, who along with Russian forces controls Mariupol, was quoted as saying by the Donetsk News Agency, known as DAN. It was unclear what would happen to the fighters who were cast by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as heroic resistance fighters but who Russian lawmakers said were ""Nazi criminals"" who should face the gravest punishment, even death. COURTS Pushilin said the fate of the surrendered Ukrainian fighters would be decided by the courts. ""As for war criminals as well as those who are nationalists, their fate, if they laid down their arms, should be decided by the courts,"" he said. ""If the enemy has laid down arms, then his fate will be decided by the courts. If it is a Nazi criminal, then it's a tribunal."" Moscow says the Azov Regiment, which began as an extreme-right nationalist paramilitary organisation, is a group of radically anti-Russian nationalist fighters and casts them as modern-day Nazi sympathisers. The regiment, formed in 2014 as a militia to fight Russian-backed separatists, denies being fascist, racist or neo-Nazi, and Ukraine says it has been reformed away from its radical nationalist origins to be integrated into the National Guard. President Vladimir Putin said what he calls a special military operation was necessary in Ukraine to prevent the persecution of Russian speakers and to prevent the United States using Ukraine to threaten Russia. Ukraine says Putin is trying to steal the country and denies that Kyiv persecuted Russian speakers. The Kremlin said the combatants would be treated in line with international norms. Ukraine has said there will be a prisoner of war exchange. Civilians who sheltered in the bunkers spoke of desperate conditions in the bunkers. Some of the fighters endured horrific battle injuries.
