1/7/2022,"Guy Reffitt is awaiting trial in jail after his son turned him into the FBI after the Capitol riot. His 19-year-old son, Jackson, told Vice News he fears his dad is radicalizing more in jail. The Capitol riot and Guy Reffitt's arrest has torn the family apart, Vice News reported. A college student who turned his father into the FBI after the Capitol riot told Vice News' David Gilbert he fears his dad is becoming more radicalized in jail. Guy Reffitt, a Texas man and member of the far-right Three Percenters group, was arrested at his home on January 19, 2021, after his son, Jackson, tipped off the FBI. According to court documents, the elder Reffitt was charged with five counts, including possession of a semi-automatic weapon on Capitol grounds. He has pleaded not guilty and is currently awaiting trial with dozens of other Capitol riot defendants at the Central Detention Facility in Washington, DC. People housed in that jail face the most serious charges relating to the insurrection. As Insider previously reported, they have in recent months bonded by organizing group activities, singing the national anthem every night, and writing newsletters. Some extremism experts have warned that those activities could leave some of the defendants more radicalized than before, Vice News previously reported. In a letter from jail published by ProPublica last May, Reffitt said he had bonded with the other defendants and was not remorseful about what happened on January 6, 2021. Jackson told Vice News of the letter: ""​​It was pretty disgusting to read that. I mean like it's psycho stuff."" ""Honestly, it made me feel worse about my decision, only because I feel like I pushed him in a more extreme direction. I made him more enthusiastic about what he's done."" In a separate interview with ABC News, Jackson said he turned his father into the FBI in December after becoming increasingly concerned by his father's seemingly radicalized rhetoric. ""If something is to really happen, then I do not want this on my shoulders as the only one that actually sees what he's doing right now,"" Jackson told ABC News. Upon returning from Washington, DC, Reffitt started to threaten his children and told Jackson that he would ""do what he had to do"" if he were reported to law enforcement, an affidavit said. He was arrested days later. Since then, the 19-year-old has fallen out with his two sisters and mother, and moved out of the family home, Vice News reported. ""I also bear the guilt of pretty much tearing this family apart and it sucks but I can't do much about it,"" he told ABC News. In a phone interview from jail, Reffitt told ABC News that he hopes to have a relationship with his son someday. ""That's my son. I love my son. I will always love my son,"" Reffitt told ABC News.

1/7/2022,"The House Jan. 6 committee has been working quickly and quietly to get the granular details of what happened on and leading up to the violent Capitol insurrection a year ago today. We already know a lot about what happened last Jan. 6 from investigators, prosecutors, and journalists, ""eye-popping vignettes about a president obsessed with subverting his own defeat, and a mob willing to do his bidding at nearly any cost,"" Kyle Cheney writes at Politico. The evidence we have is ""voluminous"" and ""devastating,"" Cheney writes. ""President Donald Trump, glued to his television as violent supporters ransacked the Capitol, ignored increasingly frantic efforts by his aides and his own children to call off the assault."" But ""the committee wants to tell the full story of Trump's actions, interactions, and refusals to act during a 187-minute timeframe between calling his allies to march to the Capitol and telling them to go home,"" Axios reports. And they know more than we do. ""The most explosive details they may be sitting on could, on the surface, be the most mundane,"" Cheney points out. ""That's because the committee, unlike the rest of us, knows precisely what time key texts were sent and urgent pleas went ignored. Where those messages fit in the already-known timeline of Trump's movements on Jan. 6 could be among the panel's more crucial findings."" He laid out several examples where knowing the precise time Trump communicated with somebody really matters in understanding his culpability for the insurrection. In her two voluntary sit-downs with the Jan. 6 committee, former Mike Pence press secretary Alyssa Farah told Axios, ""you could see how much information they already had."" The witnesses not cooperating, she added, will soon be ""realizing the committee has quite a bit more information than they realized. And their involvement is known to a much greater degree than they realized.""

1/7/2022,"A University of Kansas fraternity house’s locker room was “covered in vomit, liquor, pee, old food, trash, and who knows what else,” one prospective member told investigators. But when some of the frat’s pledges started to clean it up, they were ordered by its members to go immediately to bed without showering. That night, the student alleged, the pledges were forced to sleep in vomit-encrusted sheets. The sickening incident was one of several incidents uncovered by outside investigators and compiled in a partially redacted report obtained by the Lawrence Journal-World on Tuesday, the same day the University of Kansas suspended two prominent fraternities. Hired by national fraternity leadership, the outside investigators say they found two distinct but “comprehensive” programs of verbal, emotional, and physical abuse at Phi Gamma Delta and Phi Delta Theta. In a Tuesday letter, the university’s vice provost for student affairs, Tammara Durham, informed both frats that they had been immediately suspended. The two chapters will remain under sanction, banned from the university’s campus, until all its current members have graduated, in 2027. Fed-Up Women Swarm Kansas Frat House After Alleged Rape It was not immediately clear what prompted national fraternity officials to open the probe, but both chapters have been subject to previous hazing or disciplinary investigations at the University of Kansas. Phi Gamma Delta was scrutinized in 2012, 2015, and 2020, while Phi Delta Theta was probed in 2010, 2019, and August 2021. Durham alleged in her letter that at Phi Gamma Delta pledges were “under the control and authority of members every waking minute each day” during the fall 2021 semester, The Kansas City Star reported Wednesday. Sometimes black garbage bags would be taped over the frat house’s windows to hide what was going on inside, investigators wrote in their report. The student who described the locker room incident said that he was ultimately at a loss for words. “I don’t know what else to say other than that being a part of this fraternity has been very difficult, has caused us physical harm, emotional torture, and interfered with our chances of success in college,” he told investigators. The student alleged that he didn’t sleep for four nights because frat members would sneak into pledges’ rooms and subject them to a ritual called “tacoing,” where beds would be slammed against walls with students folded into the mattresses. One pledge was concussed after being hit against a locker, the student alleged. Another alleged incident of physical abuse, heavily redacted in the investigators’ report and outlined in Durham’s letter, detailed a pledge who had been partially restrained. His head was covered with a pillowcase. “I was getting lightheaded, and tried to tilt my head down in order to get the pillowcase off my face for a good breath,” the pledge wrote, “but was told to tilt my head back up and yelled at as consequence.” College Student Dead After Frat’s Diabolical ‘Underground Fight Club’ Over at Phi Delta Theta, members concerned about the harm that hazing was wreaking on pledges said they were frequently ostracized by their brothers. One was labeled a “snitch” and a “loser” in the house, and later moved out of the state, the investigation found. Another was strong-armed into watching a movie with a gruesome scene of a dolphin’s slaughter. That member’s name, from then on, became “Dolphin.” A university spokesperson confirmed to the Journal-World that the two frats had been suspended. “Members of these two fraternities—including the organizations’ leadership—knowingly engaged in systemic hazing that threatened the health and safety of students,” university spokesman Joe Monaco said in an email to the Journal-World. “Moreover, this behavior was the continuation of a well-documented pattern of hazing during the previous decade, demonstrating these organizations are unwilling to address this behavior themselves. This is not acceptable.” Phi Gamma Delta and Phi Delta Theta have 30 days to appeal the university’s decision. Attempts by both the Star and the Journal-World to reach representatives for the fraternities were not immediately successful. Kansas University Hit With Second Rape Allegation in Two Weeks The two houses are the latest in a streak of frats to be yanked off the University of Kansas’ campus. In 2018, its Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter was suspended by national headquarters for “at least” four years for “multiple health-and-safety violations.” Durham commended the move at the time, releasing a statement reiterating “the University’s commitment to the health and safety of our students.” Two years later, the university suspended its Pi Kappa Phi fraternity for at least five years after “an open culture” of both hazing and illegal drug use. “Breaking the cycle requires an opportunity for the organization to ‘reset’ without current members and leaders who have been an active part of the problematic culture and activities,” Durham wrote of the 2020 decision. Most recently, the university’s fraternity system came under fire after two separate accusations of rape were made within weeks of each other. More than a thousand protesters swarmed the campus’ Phi Kappa Psi chapter after a report of a Sept. 11 incident alleging that a female student had been drugged and sexually assaulted inside the house. Less than two weeks later, an allegation of rape in a dorm room was made, leading to the arrest of the accused student. Following protests held on Sept. 13 at the University of Kansas, a recent graduate told The Daily Beast that the school’s Panhellenic Association had provided sorority women a list of “safe” parties to attend while she had been enrolled. But the fraternities remained a danger to students. “None of them are safe,” she said. Read more at The Daily Beast. Get our top stories in your inbox every day. Sign up now!

1/7/2022,"It has been a year since the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. My beloved husband, U.S. Capitol Police officer Howard “Howie” Liebengood, was on duty that day and continued to serve nearly around the clock on Jan. 7, Jan. 8 and Jan. 9 with minimal sleep between shifts. Sleep-deprived and exhausted, my husband took his life the night of Jan. 9. If it had not been for the events of Jan. 6 and the unremitting work schedule on the ensuing days, I believe my husband would still be here. As anyone who has grieved a loved one knows, time is a strange thing. It’s hard to believe we are a year away from the events of that week; there are moments where it feels like this all happened yesterday. My grief is complicated by the fact that our family, including Howie’s siblings, finds ourselves at multiple intersecting points of American culture: the polarized political environment, the demands on first responders especially during a time of pandemic, and the national conversation around mental health and wellness. One of the hardest discoveries has been encountering the culture and bureaucracy around line-of-duty designations. If a law enforcement officer commits suicide, even if it was in the context of a critical incident and its aftermath like Jan. 6, they are not eligible for a line-of-duty designation. USA TODAY Editorial Board: U.S. Capitol combat shows why police deaths by suicides are sacrifices in the line of duty This is significant, because that designation is used by various entities to determine everything from who is included on a list of fallen officers to other types of memorialization like lying in honor at the U.S. Capitol to the types of benefits their spouse and/or children receive. It has been eye-opening to learn that the legal guidance and accompanying administrative processes around line of duty so clearly reflect our society’s continued struggle to acknowledge the importance of mental health beyond verbiage but in practice. Affected families are left wondering why, with all the advances in our understanding of mental health and trauma, suicide and post-traumatic stress disorder are not reflected in the designations. Put simply, the designation process reinforces stigma and fails to acknowledge the impact of work-related stressors on mental health. There are several line-of-duty designation policies, through multiple entities, and they generally recognize that the nature of this work can result in harmful physical outcomes. For example, in at least one of these policies, if an officer engages in nonroutine stressful or strenuous activity as part of an emergency response or a training exercise, and that officer has a heart attack, that is considered a death in the line of duty. If Howie had had a heart attack, we probably wouldn’t be fighting to get his death recognized and properly memorialized. USA TODAY Editorial Board: Police who died by suicide after facing combat at U.S. Capitol need to be memorialized Unfortunately, this is not a unique situation. Nationwide, estimates are that the risk of suicide among police officers is 54% greater than among American workers in general. There is a lot to be done to change that, and many people have been doing work for years to bring attention to the issue and reduce stigma. As one part of those efforts, I think that officers and families affected by suicide deserve a review of the criteria used to determine an “in the line-of-duty designation.” We can act now to ensure a trauma-informed system. I recognize that there is a larger conversation going on about policing and reform in this country. Focusing on structural changes – not just platitudes – about the importance of mental wellness and resilience for law enforcement is essential for all of us. We must do better to protect the well-being of law enforcement so they can continue to protect our communities. What happens next? Democracy can survive if House committee investigating Jan. 6 Capitol riots does its job Howie was a 15-year veteran of the U.S. Capitol Police. He was a 51-year-old husband, brother, uncle and valued friend to many. His omnipresent smile reflected his warm, gentle and compassionate personality. Howie’s loyalty to his job, his colleagues and his family and loved ones was palpable. His devotion to Congress, our country and service remains a beacon of light for his family members and community, and a reminder that relationships and people are what matter most. I’m still picking up the pieces of my broken heart, but I’m also determined to bring positive change to the institutions that failed my Howie – not just because it’s the right thing to do, but because it's what Howie would have wanted.
