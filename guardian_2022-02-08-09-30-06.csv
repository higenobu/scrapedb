2/8/2022,"Thousands of homes could soon be paid to halve their electricity usage for a couple of hours daily when the UK’s power demand is high under a new scheme to help reduce energy bills and create a zero carbon power supply system. From next week the trial by Octopus Energy and National Grid’s electricity system operator will offer the household supplier’s customers the chance to earn money by cutting their power use by between 40% and 60% below normal levels during a set two-hour period.  They could be asked to delay a laundry cycle or a dishwasher load when demand on the UK’s power grid typically climbs, such as between 9am and 11am and again between 4.30pm and 6.30pm. If they meet their electricity reduction targets they could earn up to 35p for every kilowatt-hour of electricity saved. Households will be told about each two-hour trial window by 4pm the day before it is scheduled, so they can choose in advance whether to opt-in or not. Octopus Energy is poised to invite 1.4m of its customers with an installed smart meter to take part from Friday this week, and expects about 100,000 homes to sign up for the trial which runs until the end of March. The trial could be a welcome opportunity for eligible households after the energy regulator warned that the cap on energy tariffs would soar by almost £700 from April to an average of about £2,000 a year to reflect the recent surge in global gas market prices. The trial will also help National Grid’s electricity system operator to gather data which it could use to reach its goal of running a zero carbon electricity grid by 2035. Convincing households to become more flexible about when they use electricity is also expected to be crucial in the UK’s ambition to become a net zero carbon economy by 2050, according to Isabelle Haigh, the head of National Grid’s electricity system control rooms. “This trial will provide valuable insight into how suppliers may be able to utilise domestic flexibility to help reduce stress on the system during high demand,” she said, which could help lower the cost of matching the UK’s electricity supply and demand. The scheme is similar to contracts already offered to high-energy-using companies by National Grid’s system operator arm, which pay them to cut their electricity use whendemand is high. It also mirrors an existing Octopus Energy tariff which in the past has paid thousands of customers to use more electricity when renewable energy supplies outstrip demand, such as in the early hours of a blustery morning. James Eddison, the chief technology officer at Octopus and co-founder of the company, said its previous home energy trials have shown that households “can play a key role” in improving the efficiency of the UK’s electricity system and “making sure that we’re making the most of homegrown green energy when it’s abundant”. The trial could pave the way for new tariffs that make it possible for households to cut their power bills while helping the UK to become more energy efficient and less reliant on fossil fuels such as gas power plants. It could also encourage households to install smart devices such as digitally connected electric car chargers, washing machines and dishwashers alongside home solar panel and battery packs which are expected to play a growing role in creating a carbon neutral electricity system.",News/Business,Trial scheme will pay householders to delay electricity use,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/08/trial-scheme-will-pay-householders-to-delay-electricity-use
2/8/2022,"MPs have urged the government to introduce mandatory reporting of the pay gap between staff of different ethnicities, saying there is no excuse for failing to tackle racial inequality in UK workplaces. Large companies should be required by law to publish data on employee salaries, following the framework already in place for gender, the House of Commons women and equalities committee (WEC) said in a report published on Tuesday.  The cross-party group of MPs said it is the “first step” to addressing pay disparities between employees from different ethnic backgrounds and cited research showing such efforts to address racial inequality could boost the UK economy by £24bn a year. The report recommends imposing the law from April 2023. Caroline Nokes, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said: “The government’s failure to move forwards on ethnicity pay gap reporting is perplexing. We already have the systems in place to start reporting on the ethnicity pay gap, as well as a clear impetus: tackling inequality benefits not only marginalised groups, but the whole economy. “The government has no excuse. All that is lacking, it seems, is the will and attention of the current administration.” A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) consultation on introducing mandatory pay gap reporting ended in January 2019 but the government is yet to publish any proposals. A petition with 130,000 signatories was debated in parliament, but no government response followed. Wilf Sullivan, race equality officer at the Trades Union Congress, said: “The government is dragging its feet. Mandatory ethnicity pay gap reporting is one of those rare areas where there is universal agreement across trade unions and businesses. “But the government still seems reluctant and has not said why they are not taking action on a consultation that happened two years ago. If you do not have the facts about racial inequality in your workplace, it becomes much easier to dismiss.” In a joint letter in June last year, the CBI business lobby, TUC and Equality and Human Rights Commission urged ministers to introduce mandatory disclosure to increase the number of employers reporting staff ethnicity pay gaps and spur the actions needed. Nokes said: “The government proves itself to be blind to the importance of levelling up within our communities and address longstanding disparities along the lines of protected characteristics.” In a WEC evidence session last month that heard from business and trade union leaders, Sandra Kerr, race director of network Business in the Community, said: “Company data on the ethnicity pay gap is not a silver bullet, but it is an important indicator that, as people progress up the organisation, they also get the right amount of pay.” A government spokesperson said: “We want to ensure everyone, whatever their background, has equal opportunity to succeed and achieve on merit. “We are considering the findings of the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities independent report, which included recommendations on ethnicity pay reporting, alongside feedback to our consultation on this issue. We will set out our response to this - as well as the Women and Equalities Committee report - in due course.”",News/Inequality,"Make UK employers report ethnicity pay gap, MPs tell ministers",https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2022/feb/08/ethnicity-pay-gap-report-uk-mps-committee
2/8/2022,"He is one of Shakespeare’s most reviled characters, distinguished by his “deformed, unfinish’d” figure. Now, for the first time, the Royal Shakespeare Company has cast a disabled actor in the title role of Richard III in a new production opening later this year. For Arthur Hughes, it is a “dream come true” although his first reaction to being cast as the 15th-century king of England was disbelief. “It’s a part I’ve always wanted to play, it’s a very complex role, and it’s the biggest thing I’ve done,” said Hughes, 30.  Amid debate about whether actors need lived experience to give depth and authenticity to certain roles, Hughes said: “When Richard is played by actors who are able bodied, there’s an issue of how to portray the disability, how to wear this costume. “With me, when I walk out on stage, it’s completely apparent that I have a disability. I can’t hide that. There’s a truth to it immediately, before I’ve even opened my mouth.” Having able bodied actors play disabled characters was “problematic in many ways”. He added: “It’s not to say [able bodied] people can never play these parts. But I think it’s time that we had that lived experience shown properly.” Hughes was born with a rare condition known as radial dysplasia, which affects one in 30,000 people. He has no thumb or radius bone in his right arm, and his right wrist is disfigured. He identifies as “limb different”. Richard III, depicted by Shakespeare more than 100 years after his death as an ugly hunchback, in fact suffered from scoliosis or curvature of the spine. When the last Plantagenet king’s skeleton was discovered beneath a Leicester car park 10 years ago, his twisted vertebrae were unmistakable. He came to the throne in 1483 after his nephews, the sons of King Edward IV, were consigned to the Tower of London. The children were later murdered, apparently on Richard’s orders. Richard reigned for just 26 months before being killed in the Battle of Bosworth Field during the Wars of the Roses. Directed by Gregory Doran, Shakespeare’s eponymous play will open at the company’s theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon in June. Before then, Hughes appears in a BBC drama, Then Barbara Met Alan, to be aired in the spring. It tells the story of two disabled cabaret performers who became the driving force behind the Direct Action Network, campaigning for disabled rights. “They were very brave, real freedom fighters,” said Hughes, who plays Alan Holdsworth alongside Ruth Madeley as Barbara Lisicki. “They used to throw themselves in front of buses, chain themselves to Downing Street and organise these huge actions shutting down bridges to get themselves into the spotlight. It’s a love story set against a wider backdrop of a civil rights movement.” The TV drama and the RSC production showed attitudes were changing, said Hughes, who has encountered certain “perceptions and underestimations” during his acting career. “Lead parts for disabled actors is a real next step forward. Disabled actors that you see on TV and on stage are often in smaller, fringe parts. For true representation, we need to have leading disabled actors telling stories about disability and also not about disability.” But the real breakthrough would come when disabled actors were cast in non-disabled parts, or in dramas where disability was not a central part of the story but was “just there” as part of a character’s life, he said. The RSC has cast disabled actors before, including Charlotte Arrowsmith, who identifies as deaf and uses sign language, Karina Jones, who is visually impaired, and Amy Trigg, who was born with spina bifida and uses a wheelchair. This year, the RSC is teaming up with TikTok to offer £10 tickets to all its productions to young people aged 14 to 25 with the aim of developing “a lasting commitment and love of theatre and live performance” and “diverse audiences of the future”. Erica Whyman, acting artistic director of the RSC, said the company was committed “to partnership, to inclusion and justice”.",Arts/Stage,‘There’s a truth to it’: RSC casts disabled actor as Richard III,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/08/theres-a-truth-to-it-rsc-casts-disabled-actor-as-richard-iii
2/8/2022,"The government has revived plans to make pornography websites carry out age checks, which would require British users to provide data such as their credit card or passport details to prove they are over 18. Ministers said the forthcoming online safety bill will be altered to ensure that commercial porn sites are brought within its scope, updating the draft legislation, which now applies to providers of user-generated pornography such as OnlyFans.  The digital minister, Chris Philp, said it is too easy for children to access pornography online. “Parents deserve peace of mind that their children are protected online from seeing things no child should see,” he said. “We are now strengthening the online safety bill so it applies to all porn sites to ensure we achieve our aim of making the internet a safer place for children.” The policy of introducing age checks on pornography was first announced by the Conservatives during the 2015 general election campaign but has repeatedly run into difficulties. Two years ago the government abandoned its previous plans to introduce age verification for adult sites when faced with technical difficulties, concerns from privacy campaigners and a legislative oversight. The government said that any age assurance method used by pornography sites would have to protect users’ privacy. However, individual companies will be allowed to decide how to comply with the new rule, although the communications regulator, Ofcom, may recommend some age-checking technologies. More than a third of the British population are estimated to watch online pornography, according to estimates by the age verification industry, meaning it could be an enormous technical challenge to check all their ages – and a potential big business for the companies that carry out the checks. Privacy campaigners have previously warned that requiring users of porn websites to log in could make it easier to collect – and leak – data on an individual’s viewing habits. Smaller pornography producers have complained that the change could also favour websites owned by the global pornography giant MindGeek, such as PornHub and YouPorn, which has developed its own age verification service. Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights group, said: “There is no indication that this proposal will protect people from tracking and profiling porn viewing. We have to assume the same basic mistakes about privacy and security may be about to be made again.” Pornography outlets that fail to comply with the new legislation face being fined 10% of their income, or being blocked by UK internet service providers. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said potential solutions include checking a user’s age against data held by the mobile phone provider, using a credit card check or government database checks including passport data. The Age Verification Providers Association (AVPA) said a range of age assurance methods can be used, including artificial intelligence programmes that estimate a user’s age from a selfie. Iain Corby, executive director of the AVPA, said a “double blind” method would ensure user privacy by concealing the user’s identity from commercial pornography websites, while the age verifier would not retain any data identifying which website the user visits. Despite the abandonment of previous attempts to introduce age assurance for adult sites, the issue has remained on the political agenda. Last year the UK’s data watchdog, the Information Commissioner’s Office, introduced the children’s code, which is designed to prevent websites and apps misusing children’s data, with age assurance – the broad term for methods used to determined someone’s age online – among the options. John Carr of the UK Children’s Charities’ Coalition on Internet Safety has argued that the ICO should use the children’s code to force pornography websites to introduce age assurance – an argument the data watchdog has rejected. Andy Burrows, head of child safety online policy at the NSPCC, said: “It’s right the government has listened to calls to fix one of the gaps in the online safety bill and protect children from pornography wherever it’s hosted.”",News/Society,Porn sites in UK will have to check ages in planned update to online safety bill,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/08/porn-sites-in-uk-will-have-to-check-ages-in-planned-update-to-online-safety-bill
2/8/2022,"Britain’s biggest retailers have warned that soaring living costs will hit consumer spending after a mixed start to the year amid concerns about the Omicron variant. The British Retail Consortium, which represents more than 5,000 businesses across the country, said soaring household energy prices would mean consumers tightening their purse strings over the coming months, with a knock-on effect on high streets.  It said retailers had enjoyed a strong start to the year as the absence of a January lockdown helped to keep the tills ringing during the first month of 2022, despite a drop in spending on food and drink. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said retailers and consumers faced challenges in the coming months. “Rising inflation, driven by higher costs of production, higher energy and transport prices, as well as other looming price hikes this spring will mean consumers will have to tighten their purse strings,” she said. According to the latest industry sales snapshot, families prioritised home purchases in January with growth in spending on household appliances, electronics, homeware and furniture. On a total basis, retail sales increased by 11.9% compared with January 2021 and by 7.5% compared with the same month in 2020 before the coronavirus pandemic. It said there was strong sales growth for footwear, furniture and jewellery, while spending on food and drink, toys and computing all fell in the first month of the year. Separate figures from Barclaycard showed consumer spending growth slowed in January as the government’s plan B restrictions in England and concerns over high rates of coronavirus discouraged people from heading to shops, pubs and restaurants. Barclaycard, which processes almost half of UK credit and debit card transactions, said spending rose by 7.4% in January compared with the same month in 2020 – the smallest uplift since April 2021 – as office-based workers stayed at home and hospitality sales slumped. Unlike the BRC, which compiles its figures by surveying retailers, the bank’s data is taken from card spending across retail, hospitality and leisure. Spending on specialist food and drink increased by 67.3% compared with the same month in 2020 as Britons shopped locally due to work-from-home guidance and restarted meal box subscriptions after Christmas. However, hospitality and leisure spending dropped 6.3% compared with the same month two years ago despite sales remaining stable among younger age groups – a possible sign of less concern over Covid-19. Reflecting growing concerns about Britain’s cost of living crisis, a survey of 2,000 adults on behalf of the card provider showed almost nine out of 10 consumers were worried about the impact of rising inflation on their finances. Three in 10 said they expected rising energy bills to affect the amount they spend on discretionary items. Official figures show inflation reached 5.4% in December, the highest rate in 30 years, while the Bank of England has forecast the measure for the rising cost of living could peak at 7.25% in April. It comes after Ofgem, the energy regulator, announced its cap on household gas and electricity bills would rise by 54% from April to reflect surging wholesale market costs. The government has announced a package of repayable discounts and support for poor households to cushion the blow, although charities have warned the measures are badly targeted and unlikely to prevent a sharp rise in fuel poverty for millions. Paul Martin, the UK head of retail at KPMG, which works with the BRC to compile its monthly retail snapshot, said the stronger performance for retailers in January should be put in the context of last year’s lockdown restrictions. Although retailers would be hoping for robust levels of consumer confidence after the government moved back to plan A Covid restrictions in late January, he said there were headwinds facing firms. “We could see a challenging few months ahead if wider macroeconomic conditions start to squeeze household incomes to the point that they start cutting back on retail spending,” he said. “We could easily see the health of the sector start to deteriorate if consumers choose to sit on savings to weather the storm.”",News/Business,"Cost of living crisis will hit UK consumer spending, retailers warn",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/08/cost-of-living-crisis-will-hit-uk-consumer-spending-retailers-warn

Shaista is a 10-year-old girl. She is selling plastic bags in freezing temperatures to shoppers in a busy street market in Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul. If she does not work, she says she will go hungry. The UN predicts 97% of Afghans could be living below the poverty line by June. Aid workers say the number of child labourers and beggars in Kabul has tripled, with many fighting to survive. Notable quote: “By the side of a dirty Kabul road, Khadjia sits on a plastic bag in the snow, a few brushes and shoe polish in front of her. She is four, says her mother, who sits metres away, and asked to remain anonymous.

Almost 165 years later and the letter has been downloaded 1,000 times in just three days, to be pulled apart in a scramble to decipher it for a £300 prize. Who cracked the code? A 20-year-old student from Ohio named Ken. What secrets of Dickens’ life were revealed? Ones of love and financial peril. Notable quote: “Forget Wordle. This is the Dickens Code. And for a long time, it had seemed uncrackable.” The Australian suburbia depicted in the beloved soap Neighbours won the hearts of the world and launched the careers of international stars such as Kylie Minogue and Margot Robbie.

She says stepping inside the Neighbours studio “is a wormhole to a simpler time, where no one has a real job, drama is just drama, and the people next door have become good friends”. Notable quote: “I had literally written on a piece of paper “DREAM JOB” in capital letters and then underneath, “Work on Neighbours”. I’d been watching it since I was in primary school, when Daphne woke from a coma to croak, “I love you too, Clarkey,” before carking it … By some cosmic intervention, I got my dream job, spending my days filming behind-the-scenes videos for the show and arguing with fans on Twitter.

2/8/2022,"Boris Johnson’s new communications director lobbied a former chief of staff at Downing Street not to ban Chinese technology company Huawei over spying fears, leaked documents suggest. Guto Harri, who was appointed No 10’s press chief on Monday in the wake of the partygate resignations, reportedly asked Sir Eddie Lister which ministers he could “nudge” for help.  He met Lister, who was then the prime minister’s chief of staff, as well as three top executives from the technology firm Huawei, which has links with the ruling Chinese Communist party, on 2 June 2020, according to the Sun. The paper said that Harri, representing lobbying firm Hawthorn Advisors, used the 25-minute video call to ask which ministers to approach at a time when the security service was reviewing the risk of allowing the firm into the UK’s core telecommunications network. He asked Lister if there were “any ­ministers we should talk to? Perhaps give a nudge in DCMS [Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport] or Treasury?”. The paper said that, according to minutes taken at the time, the paper said the No 10 chief of staff suggested Johnson did not want to ban Huawei but was “caught” between pressure from the Tory party and the US government. He said: “This PM is not anti-China and is not Donald Trump,” adding that Johnson “believes in good relationships with China. He is not coming from a negative place in any way.” He added: “We are caught. We want the technology, we want it rolled out. There’s an American concern and a parliamentary concern. There are a large number of MPs across the political divide who have a problem with China. Some are Atlanticists, some over Covid, some over Hong Kong, some over human rights.” No 10 defended Harri’s appointment by Johnson on Sunday when his links with Huawei were first reported and said full security checks had been concluded. However, the former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith joined Johnson’s former aide Dominic Cummings in calling for further investigation into Harri’s appointment. He said: “Given the issue of the threat to national security that Huawei poses, that lay behind why Huawei have been banned from our 5G system, it is important that there is clarity in these matters. “Will Guto Harri now be subject to full security oversight including past involvements with Huawei?” A No 10 spokesperson told the Sun: “In full compliance with appropriate guidance, government officials met with a number of interested parties, including Huawei, following the change in US policy.” Telecoms providers were ultimately told they must stop installing Huawei equipment in the UK’s 5G networks.",News/Technology,Guto Harri reportedly lobbied No 10 chief of staff to stop ban on Huawei,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/07/guto-harri-reportedly-lobbied-no-10-chief-of-staff-to-stop-ban-on-huawei
