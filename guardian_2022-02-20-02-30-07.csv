2/20/2022,"Boris Johnson has appointed six Tory donors to help run the country’s leading cultural institutions since entering Downing Street after an appeal to party backers to help “rebalance the representation” on public bodies. The donors, who have between them contributed more than £3m to party coffers, were appointed by the prime minister to the boards of the National Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the Tate and the British Museum.  One of the latest appointments to be announced is Howard Shore as a trustee of the Tate. The investment banker has contributed £1.75m to the party as an individual and through his firm Shore Capital. Former Tory culture secretary Lord Vaizey was also appointed a trustee at the same time. The government says such appointments are made after an open selection process in accordance with the Cabinet Office’s governance code on public appointments, but faces scrutiny over roles for individuals with ties to the party. Under the current system, the names of all candidates must be submitted to ministers, who then make the final appointment. Peter Riddell, the former commissioner for public appointments, has warned of a “more intensive effort” to appoint political figures to public institutions. It has emerged that Tory officials have been keen for donors to apply for public roles, circulating openings on public bodies to its donors. An email from party headquarters to donors in August 2019, the month after Johnson became PM, said: “We thought you may be interested in the latest list of public appointments. It is important Conservatives rebalance the representation at the head of these important public bodies.” The Tory donors appointed by Johnson to leading cultural institutions include John Booth, who was made a trustee of the National Gallery in August last year. Booth has donated more than £200,000 to the Tory party. In September businessman David Ross was reappointed as chair of the National Portrait Gallery. Ross helped arrange accommodation for a holiday in Mustique for Johnsonin December 2019 and has given more than £1m to the party. Ross sits on the gallery’s board with Tory MP Chris Grayling, whom Johnson appointed the previous year. Other Tory donors appointed by Johnson to cultural institutions are: Lord Marland, a Tory peer who has donated more than £300,000 to the party, appointed as trustee of the British Museum; James Lambert, a businessman whose firm has donated more than £80,000 to the party, appointed as trustee of the National Gallery; and Dounia Nadar, a philanthropist who has donated more than £66,000 to the party. All three were appointed in December. The government says the selection process for public bodies is open and rigorous, but Tory officials have been keen to support its financial backers seeking public roles. The Observer revealed this month how officials were keen to help one of its biggest donors Mohamed Amersi in his ultimately unsuccessful bid to become chair of the National Lottery Community Fund. One email stated: “I know you work with the public appointments team. Can we see that he is at least considered for the role.” Amersi has told the Observer he was shortlisted on his merits for the job and was not aware of any help from the Conservative party. The committee on standards in public life has called for stronger powers for the commissioner for public appointments to ensure the right balance between ministerial patronage and appointments on merit. There are concerns about appointments which are unregulated or don’t go through a rigorous and transparent selection process. The high court ruled last week that the government acted unlawfully and breached equality rules in appointing Baroness Dido Harding as interim chair of the National Institute for Health Protection in August 2020 during the pandemic. The role of non-executive directors in government departments is unregulated and is overseen by the lead non-executive director Lord Nash, a Tory peer who, with his wife, has contributed more than £500,000 to the Conservative party. Tory donors who are non-executive directors include Dominic Johnson, a Tory donor and chief executive of Somerset Capital Management, a firm co-founded by the Brexit minister Jacob Rees-Mogg, at the Department for International Trade; Ben Goldsmith, brother of Lord Goldsmith, the international environment minister, at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; and Ranjit Baxi, a businessman in the recycling industry, at the Department for Transport. Chris Bryant, the Labour MP and chair of the parliamentary committee on standards, said sweeping reforms were required across several areas of public life to restore public confidence, including appointments. He said: “We need root and branch reform of the public appointments system and also the revolving door between government and industry, the governance of all party parliamentary groups and lobbying.” A government spokesperson said: “The government encourages applications to public appointments from talented individuals from a wide range of backgrounds across the UK. All public appointments are made objectively based on merit. “The governance code is clear that ‘political activity should not affect any judgment of merit nor be a bar to appointment’ and must be declared.”",News/Politics,Six Tory donors given top cultural posts since Boris Johnson became PM,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/19/six-tory-donors-given-top-cultural-posts-since-boris-johnson-became-pm
2/20/2022,"Finally, Watford threw a punch and it landed. It is little wonder their travelling supporters celebrated wildly. After all, when Emmanuel Dennis nodded Ismaïla Sarr’s cross past Emi Martínez, 440 minutes had passed since they last saw their side score. The worry in recent weeks had not been flailing arms but a complete inability to jab. Instead, they had been taking blows on what is, under Roy Hodgson, admittedly a much stronger chin, and praying to avoid a knockout.  Dennis himself had been guilty, failing to register a shot on target in his last four matches. But his ninth goal of the season was enough to seal a precious three points. After 11 winless games, it could not have been timelier. Crazily Watford’s last half-dozen top-flight away wins have come under the same number of managers. Aston Villa fans must wonder what happened to the razor sharp attacking instincts evident in their 3-3 draw with Leeds ten days ago. Ben Foster will scarcely ‘earn’ a more comfortable Premier League clean sheet. Following the worst display of his tenure in defeat at Newcastle, Steven Gerrard made clear he expected a rapid start. What he got was zippy – John McGinn fizzed into a pair of early crowd-pleasing challenges – and adventurous. Having hinted at a much-changed line up, it ended up being just one; Ollie Watkins replaced by Danny Ings who was an energetic talisman, intent on linking midfield and attack. Having seen a shot blocked by Craig Cathcart inside the opening minute, he won a corner moments later under pressure from Samir. Replays brought audible dissatisfaction from the majority of Villa Park but VAR did not overturn the decision. Ings hit the base of a post following Emi Buendía’s defence-splitting nudge, although it transpired he had mistimed his run. But that was about all Villa had. Buendía, Jacob Ramsey and Philippe Coutinho had off-target efforts before the break, the latter duo doing likewise after it. Just before the hour, with frustration growing in the stands, Gerrard introduced Watkins for Douglas Luiz. Ashley Young and Leon Bailey arrived not long afterwards. It felt like one moment of quality might do the trick, and Tom Cleverley’s foul on Coutinho presented Lucas Digne that chance; the free-kick bent round the wall but did not come back far enough to trouble Foster. Watford arrived late and, save for Cathcart, started as if the blood was still returning to their legs. Several times the centre-back nipped danger in the bud. Cathcart is not one for headlines or fanfare but will never be underappreciated by Hornets’ fans. They did though have Sarr available to start for the first time since November. Hodgson’s first three games in charge saw him literally clip his side’s wings with a narrow midfield four, but with Sarr back, they reverted to a more familiar 4-3-3. It gave them width plus the ability to counter. And Sarr and Dennis – tormenters of Aston Villa on the opening day of the campaign – almost combined in the first half, the former finding the latter in acres of space on the left. Dennis jinked inside and forced Martínez to palm his strike away. The visitors grew in belief. Shortly after half-time they broke again, Moussa Sissoko blazing into the side netting. Dennis – free and central – was not amused. The smile though, returned before long.",Sport/Football,Emmanuel Dennis sinks Villa to give Watford hope in fight for survival,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/19/aston-villa-watford-premier-league-match-report
2/20/2022,"The family of a British man killed by a shark in Australia have paid tribute to “a wonderful human being” who had a “rare gift” of connecting with people. Simon Nellist, 35, died in the great white shark attack on Wednesday off Little Bay, east Sydney – the first fatal attack in Sydney for 60 years.  Nellist, who was a diving instructor, had grown up in the west Cornwall village of Ludgvan near Penzance, before emigrating to Australia where he had set up home with his fiancee, Jessie Ho, whom he was about to marry. The former RAF engineer, who survived two tours of Afghanistan, was a “proud Cornishman” and a “very talented photographer” the family said, adding they would “miss him terribly”. “Simon was a gentle, kind and wonderful human being. He was a cherished fiance, son, brother, uncle and friend,” they said. “Simon was funny, compassionate and always had time for people. He had a rare gift of instantly being able to connect with others, gaining their trust and respect. Simon had a great passion for nature and the sea, as well as being a very talented photographer.” Nellist would swim regularly at the beach, the BBC reported, and had been training for a charity swim when he was attacked. State government shark experts who analysed footage of the incident, which had been recorded by a member of the public, said they believed the predator to be a great white shark that was “at least three metres” long. Most city beaches were initially shut after the incident and swimmers had been banned from the water. However, swimmers were once again taking to the water at Little Bay on Saturday. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, the shark has not been captured. Nellist’s friend Della Ross told the Australian broadcaster 7News: “Everything that is connected to Simon, to me, is connected to the ocean. The news hit us like a truck because he is really one of the people that makes this earth better.” Kris Linto, who witnessed the attack, told Australian network Nine News: “[The person] was swimming and a shark came and attacked [him] vertically. “We heard a yell and turned around, it looked like a car had landed in the water, a big splash then the shark.” Reports said authorities had retrieved body parts from the water. Deadly shark attacks are rare in Sydney as it has various deterrents, including nets, in the waters. The last fatal shark attack in Sydney is believed to have been in 1963. Following Wednesday’s incident, a UK spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said consular staff were in touch with New South Wales police. “We are supporting the family of a British man and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time,” the FCDO spokesperson added.",News/Environment,Family pay tributes to British man killed by a shark in Australia,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/19/family-pay-tributes-to-british-man-killed-by-a-shark-in-australia
2/20/2022,"Chelsea have developed a useful habit of leaving things until the last minute and it needed a late volley from Hakim Ziyech to snatch a victory that was scarcely deserved. They may be newly-crowned world champions but Thomas Tuchel would have been more than slightly concerned at the way his side performed for most of this match. Had it not been for Ziyech’s intervention two minutes from time after he had seen an earlier effort disallowed for offside then they would find themselves even more marooned in third place than they already are.  As it is, they can just about claim to still be hanging onto Manchester City and Liverpool’s coat tails. Exactly four weeks had passed since Chelsea’s victory over Tottenham in their last Premier League match, with Tuchel’s side having required extra-time to progress past both Plymouth and Palmeiras in the intervening period. The latter in Abu Dhabi last week meant their kits proudly sported a new badge signifying their status as World Club champions - an honour that has clearly been welcomed by the German’s superiors at Stamford Bridge. In a rare departure for their manager since his arrival last January, they started with a four-man defence that saw Andreas Christensen deployed at right-back, while there were recalls for Christian Pulisic and Ziyech in attack. Patrick Vieira also made four changes from Palace’s last match - a drab 0-0 draw at Brentford - but surprisingly chose Wilfried Zaha to lead his forward line and left three centre-forwards on the bench. With loanee Conor Gallagher also ineligible to face his parent club, there was a welcome return in midfield for captain James McArthur after injury and Cheikhou Kouyate, who was given a guard of honour by his Palace team-mates in training this week after winning the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal. Zaha played through the middle during the second half against Brentford and the decision to give him another opportunity here almost paid dividends inside the first seven minutes. Jeffrey Schlupp’s ball found the Ivory Coast forward in aces of space and he was able to set up Michael Olise for a shot that dribbled just past the far post. Having made a slow start as they seemed to adjust to an unfamiliar formation, it was Antonio Rüdiger who finally sparked them into life when his piledriver form 35 yards was tipped over by Vicente Guaita. The Spaniard then had to be at his best to deny Ngolo Kanté following a precise through ball from Malang Sarr. Palace looked dangerous on the few occasions when they managed to beat Chelsea’s press and were twice just inches away from connecting to pinpoint crosses from the left foot of Olise, who was on Chelsea’s books until the age of 14. A slaloming run from the 20-year-old that carved open the visitors’ defence just before half-time should have created the opening goal, only for Zaha to curl his effort agonisingly wide of the far post. Vieira was forced into a substitution at the break as the injured Guaita made way for Jack Butland. But Palace continued to look the more threatening side as they piled the pressure on Chelsea’s increasingly makeshift-looking defence. Schlupp’s effort from just outside the box sailed way over the crossbar after Jordan Ayew had inexplicably passed up the opportunity to shoot. Ziyech looked like he fancied his chances of breaking the deadlock when Kai Havertz was brought down on the edge of the box by a combination of Schlupp and Clyne. But the Moroccan’s free-kick straight into the wall was as weak an effort as you will ever see. Romelu Lukaku was supposed to provide Chelsea with that cutting edge and after scoring against Palmeiras, it seemed like he had delivered again 15 minutes from time. Butland could only push the Belgian’s powerful shot into the path of Ziyech and he fired into the empty net, only for the goal to be disallowed because Lukaku had strayed offside in the buildup. Palace would not be so fortunate the next time, however, with Ziyech slamming home Marcos Alonso’s cross before Zaha wasted a late chance to equalise.",Sport/Football,Last-minute Hakim Ziyech goal gives Chelsea victory at Crystal Palace,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/19/crystal-palace-chelsea-premier-league-match-report
2/20/2022,"Another day, another giant shot in the arm for Arsenal’s top-four prospects. They would have been cheered by West Ham’s lunchtime draw against Newcastle and capitalised fully here, meriting their second-half goals from Emile Smith Rowe and Bukayo Saka. It was dominant fare from Mikel Arteta’s players and a direct reversal of the scoreline when these sides met in August. This time the gulf in quality was pronounced, and they ended Saturday a point off fourth place, with two games in hand on Manchester United. Christian Nørgaard’s late effort, given by VAR, flattered the visitors. Brentford had pummelled Arsenal on that opening night, but the tone always appeared likely to differ here. The early exuberance of Thomas Frank’s side had faded, a run of four points from their last nine outings drilling home a few Premier League realities, while their hosts could regard a Champions League spot with more than mere optimism.  Accordingly Arsenal made all of the first-half running. Lacking the hold-up play of Ivan Toney, again absent with a calf problem, Brentford could do little to prevent the ball being sent back towards them with discomfiting frequency. Their defending was uncompromising but scruffy, and there was always the sense they were on the verge of being pulled apart. As they tend to at the Emirates, Arsenal set off at speed. Their cause was helped by the atmosphere. Arteta has been keen to foster a bunker mentality after a run of refereeing decisions which, to the more one-eyed viewers of an Arsenal stripe, beggar belief; it did no harm in whipping up fury here at the most minor of grievances, Arteta himself running to interrogate the fourth official Simon Hooper after one challenge by Rico Henry on Saka went unpunished. They briefly celebrated a goal in the 12th minute, only for Alexandre Lacazette to be ruled offside after converting Kieran Tierney’s centre. The flag went up straightaway but a lengthy VAR check suggested the call had been tight; it certainly was, and perhaps more than that depending on your favoured angle. Seven minutes before half-time Arsenal’s players surrounded Jonathan Moss when Yoane Wissa, sprinting to block a Cedric Soarés shot, appeared to divert it away with his upper arm. Nothing was given but, in the era of video technology, more outlandish claims have earned reward. The appeals rained in throughout the opening period, along with a stream of shots and crosses. Arsenal’s deliveries from wide were generally on point, save for the fact that there was no onrushing centre-forward to profit. Their attempts to score largely found a yellow-clad body before David Raya could be troubled. Saka and Thomas Partey screwed wide while Martin Ødegaard, pulling the strings gracefully, saw an effort diverted away. A couple of early forays aside, one of which saw a Bryan Mbeumo shot charged down, Brentford had rarely got out for a sustained spell. Four minutes after the restart, the Bees were finally taught that approach would not hold. Smith Rowe’s lack of recent starts has been owed largely to the form of Gabriel Martinelli, who was suspended here. His inclusion on the left was never going to be a downgrade and that bore out when, taking Lacazette’s sprayed pass midway inside the Brentford half, he made for their penalty area. Slipping between Sergi Canós and Kristoffer Ajer, both of whom were reluctant to make a challenge, he snaked a precise curler into the far corner via Raya’s fingertips. It was a gorgeous goal and Arsenal deserved it. They continued to be largely untroubled, even if the territorial scales evened up a little. Brentford’s first hint at a clear opening came in the 69th minute when Mbeumo found space beyond Gabriel Magalhães but could not bring the ball under control; by then Saka had forced Raya into a smothering save, although Arsenal had not created much more. That was put right soon enough. Brentford began to commit men forward, Tierney intercepting vitally as Mbeumo lurked, and Raya tipped an Ødegaard shot away after defensive indecision had sent him clear. Then, straight after Wissa had dithered in a promising area, Arsenal broke again. This time Partey fed Saka, who sent in a raking left-footer that beat Raya inside the same upright. Nørgaard caused last-gasp flutters but Arsenal have a sizeable chance in their hands.",Sport/Football,Saka seals comfortable victory over Brentford for assured Arsenal ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/19/arsenal-brentford-premier-league-match-report
2/20/2022,"Germany extended their historic sliding dominance at the Beijing Games with a one-two finish in the women’s bobsleigh to finish ahead of the United States’ Elana Meyers Taylor, who took bronze to become the most decorated Black athlete in Winter Games history in what may be her final race. Again there was disappointment for Great Britain at these Games after the GB pair of Mica McNeil and Montell Douglas finished a lowly 17th on the day when the men’s curlers narrowly missed out on gold.  Laura Nolte held off defending Olympic champion and countrywoman Mariama Jamanka to capture a record-extending eighth sliding gold for the German team, who have swept all four luge and both skeleton events in addition to the two-man and two-woman bobsleigh on the sparkling new course nestled in the tree-lined southern foot of Xiaohaituo Mountain. Nolte, who became the youngest ever female Olympic medallist in bobsleigh, paired with brakewoman Deborah Levi to clock a four-run combined time of 4min 03.96 sec, a yawning 0.77sec faster than Jamanka and Alexandra Burghardt. “I’ve never had this feeling before,” the 23-year-old Nolte said. “It’s like we are drunk, but we’re not. We’re just drunk on happiness.” The 37-year-old Meyers Taylor, who won the silver in the Olympic debut of monobob earlier this week before hinting at possible retirement, came in 1.52sec off the pace alongside Olympic debutante Sylvia Hoffman to earn a fifth career medal and eclipse speed skater Shani Davis’s mark for most won by an athlete of colour. “There’s a lot of people that came before me,” Meyers Taylor said. “[2002 Olympic gold medalist] Vonetta Flowers is the reason I’m here, and Shani Davis and even [US speed skater] Erin Jackson. It’s just been such a long legacy of Black athletes at the Winter Olympics and hopefully it just continues.” She added: “We want everybody to come out regardless of the colour of your skin. We want winter sports to be for everybody, regardless of race, regardless of socio-economic class. I think the more diversity we have, the stronger our sport can be. So hopefully this is just the start of more and more people coming out and trying winter sports.” Meyers Taylor will take a far more leisurely trip on Sunday nighttonight when she carries the US flag into the Bird’s Nest for the closing ceremony, an honour she was forced to cede after testing positive for Covid-19 on arrival at Beijing, which kept her apart from her two-year-old son longer than ever before. Three-time Olympic champion Kaillie Humphries, who captured two-woman golds with Canada in 2010 and 2014 before joining the US team in 2019, dropped from fifth at the halfway stage to seventh overall after winning a third career gold in Monday’s monobob – the lone sliding event of nine in Yanqing that hasn’t gone to the Germans. “It hurts, I won’t lie,” said Humphries, who was denied in her bid to join Germany’s Kevin Kuske and Andre Lange as the only bobsleighers to win four Olympic golds but confirmed her intent to come back for the Milan Cortina Games in 2026, when she will be 40. “I gave every ounce of everything I had to the last two days and it wasn’t there. I’m proud of the work that we put in and what we put into it. It sucks and it’s infuriating to know that it wasn’t good enough, but at the end of the day, that’s racing.” Earlier, Team GB’s Brad Hall piloted his four-man Great Britain team to within 0.31 seconds of a rare Olympic medal, bouncing back nicely after crashing dramatically on the penultimate run of the two-man competition on Tuesday. Hall, Greg Cackett, Nick Gleeson and Taylor Lawrence were in sixth place at the halfway stage, 0.69sec behind the first of two German teams atop the leaderboard with Canada’s Justin Kripps sitting third. “Couple of mistakes on the first run,” Hall said. “It wasn’t a bad performance. Sitting in sixth place, I’m quite content with that.” The 31-year-old from Cardiff, who has reached three podiums in the discipline on the World Cup circuit this season, has marshaled a largely self-funded campaign to Beijing after UK Sport controversially defunded Team GB’s bobsleighers three years ago despite the country’s best ever women’s bobsleigh result in Pyeongchang. Now Hall’s four-man team enter today’s final runs in the hunt for Britain’s second four-man medal in 58 years – and first since John Jackson was awarded a retrospective bronze in 2014. “It’s a pretty difficult thing for us to do, work out what’s best,” Hall said. “We’re just one team. When you’re looking at competing against the Germans, there’s three of them. They’ve got three times the amount of runs to test everything, find the best way down the track and what best equipment works as well. We’re against it, we’ve got a lot less resources to pull upon, but we’ve just gone with what we know and [we’ll] see where it turns out.”",Sport/Sport,Germany’s women slide to Winter Olympics glory with bobsleigh one-two,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/19/germanys-women-slide-to-glory-with-one-two-in-bobsleigh
2/20/2022,"Goal by goal, landmark after landmark, Mohamed Salah is establishing his place in Anfield history. Less than five years after joining, he brought up 150 goals for Liverpool with a strike that combined pace, audacity and importance. As he became their second quickest player to 150 — faster than Robbie Fowler, speedier than Ian Rush, sooner than Michael Owen, Kenny Dalglish, Steven Gerrard or Billy Liddell — he helped transform an awkward afternoon for Liverpool into an enjoyable one. It was about the spectacular as well as the statistical and it was capped by a brilliant first Liverpool goal for Luis Díaz. As their other scorers, Sadio Mane and Salah, have both become centurions under Jürgen Klopp, the precedents for the newcomer are hugely encouraging.  Yet this had threatened to be a historic occasion instead for Norwich City. Liverpool’s eighth successive win at Anfield only came after they trailed. Inter Milan had failed to record a shot on target against Klopp’s team. Norwich did and led at Anfield. For a heady quarter of an hour, they could dream of a first win here since Jeremy Goss scored the final goal in front of the old Kop in 1994. Then Liverpool’s attackers intervened. They delivered the stunning goals twice in three minutes. The equaliser came courtesy of one of Mane’s most acrobatic goals. When Jordan Henderson floated a cross to the left and Kostas Tsimikas headed it back across the penalty area, Mane responded with a wonderful overhead kick. Minus the injured Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino, he had a rare outing as a striker, a role he may play more often if Díaz forces his way into Klopp’s strongest side. This was an auspicious start. Then Salah plucked Alisson’s long ball out of the air, darted away from Angus Gunn and rolled his shot past Norwich’s retreating defenders. A landmark was celebrated in suitable style, and deservedly. His 150 goals came in just 233 games, and only Roger Hunt has taken fewer for Liverpool. It says something about his appetite for goals that he set about getting his 151st. A curler went just wide, a long-range drive was parried, a third effort was dragged past the near post. Brandon Williams was tormented. Salah’s strike was a notable moment for Alisson, too: the second time the goalkeeper has assisted a Salah goal. With Trent Alexander-Arnold rested — Joe Gomez instead got his first league start in 468 days at right-back — Liverpool needed someone to compensate for the creativity of the player with the most assists in the division. Improbably, their goalkeeper obliged. The least meaningful goal in terms of the result may acquire the greatest significance in the long term. Liverpool committed £50m for a scorer and, from Henderson’s defence-splitting pass, Diaz dinked a shot over Gunn. It may be of scant consolation to Norwich that there was evidence of their improvement. They had sieved seven goals at Stamford Bridge and five at the Etihad Stadium. There was no hat-trick of humiliations away at the top three and they consigned one unflattering fact to the past. They were yet to score against one of the top nine this season. Their wait was ended with the aid of Joel Matip. As two summer signings from Werder Bremen combined, Josh Sargent finding Milot Rashica and the Kosovan let fly from 20 yards, Matip’s attempt to block it instead proved a telling deflection, leaving Alisson’s motionless. Liverpool had mustered 15 shots before then, even if the numbers gave a flattering impression of a first-half display when they were not at their most eviscerating and when the clearest opportunity fell Teemu Pukki’s way. He skewed it past the post but while it took time for Liverpool to locate their best, when they did it was glorious.",Sport/Football,Mohamed Salah’s landmark goal helps Liverpool avoid Norwich shock,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/19/liverpool-norwich-premier-league-match-report
2/20/2022,"Frank Lampard did not return to the dugout for a relegation scrap but Everton are firmly in danger after falling to an insipid defeat at Southampton. Stuart Armstrong struck before the substitute Shane Long sealed victory less than two minutes after stepping off the bench, heading in with his first touch to register his first Premier League goal in almost two years. Jordan Pickford, who ensured Everton went in at half-time with the score blank, had a face like thunder. Southampton, meanwhile, can start thinking about making a play for the European places.  For Everton, a wishy-washy performance was typified by the manner of Southampton’s opener seven minutes after the interval. Oriol Romeu, who has made light of his supposed shelf life in the centre of Southampton’s midfield this season, stole possession from the Everton substitute André Gomes and found Ché Adams, who shuffled the ball on. Armstrong took one touch to compose himself and coolly picked his spot, curling inside Pickford’s near post. Everton could not argue it hadn’t been coming and they had their goalkeeper to thank for preventing James Ward-Prowse and Tino Livramento, the former from a rasping free-kick, from scoring in the first half. Lampard spent much of the first 45 minutes wandering around the dotted Everton technical area, shielding his eyes from the low sun and wave after wave of Southampton attacks. Ashley Cole, the Everton first-team coach, again assumed a more neutral position alongside the analysts in the press box. For the travelling Everton supporters, whose journey was hampered by Storm Eunice, it made for particularly underwhelming viewing. Richarlison and Alex Iwobi were often crowded out by a pack of red-and-white shirts, Romeu or Ward-Prowse invariably among them. At one point Kyle Walker-Peters miraculously kept the ball in on the touchline after brushing off Iwobi before playing a one-two with Mohamed Elyounoussi and taking aim at goal. Walker-Peters went even closer six minutes before the break, thrashing a shot narrowly wide. Armando Broja was again superb in attack, dragging a shot narrowly wide with nine minutes to play and also saw a first-half effort saved by Pickford after the Everton captain, Séamus Coleman, did just enough to deny the striker a clean shot at goal. A couple of minutes later Broja put Jonjoe Kenny to all fours before winning a corner, from which Jan Bednarek headed against the crossbar.It was no surprise that Lampard hooked Allan for Gomes at the interval, with the midfielder fortunate to avoid two bookings in quick succession. Everton were permeable in defence and flattered to deceive just about everywhere else. Donny van de Beek was overrun in midfield and one of many blue shirts left chasing shadows, while Dominic Calvert-Lewin was stranded in attack. Armstrong saw another shot fly on to the roof of Pickford’s net and Elyounoussi should have doubled Southampton’s lead on 64 minutes. Ward-Prowse’s free-kick was on the money and Elyounoussi slipped Coleman, who totally lost his man at the back post. But the Norwegian, perhaps put off by Mohammed Salisu’s desperate attempt to reach the ball, headed against the bar. Yet Southampton eventually got the second goal they deserved when Long rose above Coleman to head in Livramento’s cross.

It’s a miracle my organs are still working to be honest, I’ve eaten so much of them. Then a blue ice pole for dessert. I’ve had a lot of interesting conversations over a lot of interesting meals. One was a Thanksgiving dinner in a prison in Iowa with a load of female lifers. They’re in prison for the rest of their lives, they’re going to die there, so they look forward to this for months. It’s a big deal: they were pressing their shirts, everyone looked super-smart and we’re sat there eating lukewarm turkey. I’ve eaten in loads of prisons; it’s a bit like plane food, not bad.  On Strictly, I was living off Hobnobs. You’re dancing till silly o’clock; honestly, sometimes we were dancing 12, 13 hours a day and I was just in such great shape. So it was biscuits and crisps, I wasn’t eating quinoa. Some people describe these idyllic memories of baking with their mum and preparing food for hours with their mum. There wasn’t really any of that. We got home from school, then my mum had to go to work and so dinner was in the oven or in the fridge or a couple of quid on the side to go to the chippy. It doesn’t matter how much I resist, I am now middle-class. I can’t deny it. I never used to eat olives and balsamic vinegar, and now I do. My palate has changed. My favourite cuisine is Japanese. I just never get fed up of sushi: when I was in Japan, I was having tuna nigiri for breakfast every single day. And I remember being addicted to these bottles of warm green tea that you get out of vending machines. I was living off them: my skin must have been immaculate because I was just drinking green tea and eating tuna. I had the diet of a supermodel. My stomach is made of tin. I shouldn’t say that, I shouldn’t be too cocky; I’m going to get ill next week, aren’t I? I haven’t drunk alcohol for years. It’s probably about 15 years since I’ve been drunk. When I was younger, I’d just go out and get really pissed. By the age of 18, 19, I’d got it out of my system. I’d already been down the park drinking for years. When you’re older, it feels like, “Oh, you’re allowed to do it now.” So it feels less naughty. My partner Kev [dancer Kevin Clifton] is useless at cooking, too. We eat a lot of takeouts. For his last birthday, we had a chef and she did lobster pasta and then white chocolate pasta for dessert. It was quite heavy on the pasta, but it was gorgeous. The chef didn’t give me the recipe – I think she knew that it’d be lost on me. Know what would help my cooking? This is so me. If I had a nice kitchen. You want to hang out in the kitchen, don’t you? My kitchen’s really ugly at the minute. It’s super-old and super-dated. Recently I was hanging out with a load of nuns in a convent. And I was like: “Actually, I really love what they’ve done with the place.” Just one long, solid set of cupboards and one shelf, dimly lit. Maybe a little fire and a couple of chairs and the table. I want it to look like either I’ve just moved in or I’ve just been robbed. I’ve just made a cooking show, Hungry For It – it’s a really lovely series with 10 brilliant cooks, but not professional chefs. As you’ve learned, I’m completely useless when it comes to cooking and food, but my job was to look after the aspiring chefs and make sure they felt comfy. It can be quite high-pressured, can’t it? And you end up having such a soft spot for these people. You’re rooting for them because we know a TV show can totally change their life. FoodIf I’m celebrating, oysters. I could eat, I don’t know, 20 oysters, one after the other. That’s a bit gluttonous, now I say it. DrinkCup of tea, Yorkshire tea, with oat milk. And if I’m out for dinner, I’ll have a Shirley Temple. RestaurantWe’re a bit late to the game, but we went to Luca [in Clerkenwell] recently and it felt very relaxed and the food was beautiful. Desperate to go back there. Dish to makeA roast dinner is the one dish I’m actually capable of making. For whatever reason, I haven’t grasped the concept of cooking as an adult. I’m just useless. But I am able to nail a roast. And when I’m travelling, you’re a bit nostalgic, and a roast is comfort food, isn’t it? Are You Really OK?

2/20/2022,"5 Live Drive (BBC 5 Live) | iPlayerNazanin (BBC Radio 4) | BBC SoundsShaun Keaveny’s Community Garden Radio/Shaun Keaveny’s Creative Cul De Sac “A lot of news today,” said Clare McDonnell on Tuesday, her second day on 5 Live Drive alongside veteran Tony Livesey. She wasn’t wrong: the Prince Andrew statement landed just as the programme started.  McDonnell was unfazed. A vastly experienced presenter, with the BBC 6 Music, Radio Kent and the World Service under her belt, as well as often covering 5 Live slots, she’s stepped into Anna Foster’s place with aplomb (Foster is now the BBC’s Middle East correspondent) and she’s already into her stride. “She’ll do,” said one text to the programme on Tuesday and McDonnell was chuffed. She should be: a newbie at the helm of an established BBC radio show isn’t always welcomed. Radio listeners do not always like change, as Jo Whiley, Craig Charles or Emma Barnett can attest. To be fair, the listeners are sometimes right: controllers can be clumsy in forcing out old favourites or moving presenters around. But the warm and newsy McDonnell is not one of those appointments. She’s made for this show. On Tuesday, her interviews with various US lawyers about thesettlement between Prince Andrew and Virginia Giuffre – about what it might actually mean, beneath the legalese – were insightful and pointed. On Wednesday, she spoke to Matt, a young man with autism who volunteers at a farm, and Kwajo Tweneboa, the inspirational campaigner for better social housing. In both interviews, she was empathic as well as serious, teasing out the background that creates these gripping individual stories. I do enjoy 5 Live Drive; the camaraderie between Livesey and McDonnell is cheering and its news stories mix well with more human tales. This is due to excellent production, as well as great presentation. Plus: the listeners. On Tuesday, they were asked to suggest who could play Livesey in the forthcoming Netflix film Bank of Dave (based on the real life of Dave Fishwick, Livesey’s childhood friend). “Sean Bean,” said one. “Or if he’s not available, Mr Bean.” On Wednesday, they got in touch to describe when they had met famous people in real life. This was inspired by Livesey and McDonnell being about to go to see Echo and the Bunnymen and McDonnell not wanting to go backstage, for fear of embarrassment. A listener texted in to say that, a few years ago, he’d pretended to be Ian McCulloch, lead singer of Echo and the Bunnymen, in order to blag his way into a gig. The producers got him on the phone. If you’re feeling down about the world, 5 Live Drive will keep you cheerful while you eat your tea. While we’re talking great producers, here’s Ceri Thomas, chief producer on the Today programme between 2006 and 2012, before he moved to Panorama and, for the past few years, Tortoise Media. Now Thomas has turned reporter-presenter, for Nazanin, a five-part Radio 4 series that explains the background to Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe being held hostage in Iran. Unsurprisingly, Thomas is excellent. His opening salvo, about how ordinary people can get caught up in world events, has stayed with me: “It’s as if the scenery steps forward and engulfs us.” He explained everything: the debt that the UK owes to Iran; why it’s hard to pay it; how decisions taken before Zaghari-Ratcliffe was even born are now being played out, with her as one of the pawns. He was especially good on political will: Jeremy Hunt talked about how close he got to getting Zaghari-Ratcliffe out, before he failed. God, this is heartbreaking stuff. “The state is the coldest of cold monsters,” said Thomas. Shaun Keaveny, one of those presenters who fell victim to a controller reshuffle, has been busily continuing his audio career. I mentioned last week that he’s set up an internet “station”, Community Garden Radio, where he broadcasts live for two hours every Friday. If you join his Patreon for £4 a month, you get the station and also a podcast, Creative Cul De Sac, as well as Keaveny’s regular blogs and musings. (This on top of another, free-to-access podcast, about festivals: The Line-Up. He’s working hard.) The radio shows are very Keaveny, meaning: packed with familiar music (Jarvis, the Style Council, Blur), plus funny little features: Lost and Found, Wedding Playlist (something old, something new etc). The plan is eventually to have callers, said Keaveny on Friday, but not immediately: “The shoes are new. They’re still a bit squeaky and rubbing at the back.” In Creative Cul De Sac, Keaveny and his guest explore their unrealised ideas, the ones written down but never used. After Keaveny’s somewhat rambly opener, his conversation with Greg James, his first guest, was great. James spoke about why most of his ideas are radio ones, rather than anything else: “The listeners, they come back with the other half.” Just as in 5 Live Drive. And it is listeners that Keaveny is gradually building. It may take a while, but you feel he’ll get there.",Arts/Television & radio,The week in radio: 5 Live Drive; Nazanin; Shaun Keaveny’s Community Garden Radio and more,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/19/5-live-drive-clare-mcdonnell-review-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-radio-4-ceri-thomas-shaun-keaveny-community-garden-radio-creative-cul-de-sac
2/20/2022,"The François Truffaut season at the BFI in London remains a delightful event for me, irrespective of the fact that some of the director’s less well-known films turn out to be turkeys. Agreed: The Woman Next Door from 1981, starring Gérard Depardieu and Fanny Ardant, is quite terrible. But deprived of travel, as we have been for so long, there in the darkness I hardly cared. The clothes, the houses, the restaurants: not since I was a moody teenager and obsessed with Françoise Sagan has la vie française seemed more bewitching. Each film makes me think again about the way movies date (or not). While some age painfully fast – the scene in which Ardant finds herself in her underwear at a garden party, her dress having been ripped off in one fell swoop, is straight out of Benny Hill – others come into their own only late in life. When The Bride Wore Black was released in 1968, for instance, the critics disliked it. But in 2022, it reads rather well, at least for any women in the audience. Every time the vengeful widow played by Jeanne Moreau (in a startling monochrome wardrobe by Pierre Cardin) sets about killing another of the men responsible for the shooting of her husband on her wedding day, she must first endure not only their utter conviction that, yes, of course this beautiful woman only wants to sleep with them, but also their inevitably pompous monologues. Truffaut gave us mansplaining avant la lettre.  Parents, don’t give up on your recalcitrant children! They will come good in the end. My young self, who refused ever to practise the piano no matter how much I was nagged, would be amazed to learn of my latest project: an essay I’ve written for BBC Radio 3 about JS Bach (part of a series celebrating the 300th birthday of The Well-Tempered Clavier, it will be broadcast this week). These days, I don’t even own a piano. But my love for classical music grows exponentially with every year that passes, a blessing for which I should really give grateful thanks, not only to my long-suffering parents but also to the many teachers who had to put up with both my rotten arpeggios and my barefaced lies (“Yes, I have practised every night for an hour… No, I have no idea why this has had no effect whatsoever on my playing”). I’m enjoying Nine Quarters of Jerusalem, a new biography of the Old City by Matthew Teller (it’s published next month). The fact that it’s as much about the present as the past makes it vivid, even if it does come with standard tales of the utterly dysfunctional Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where a ladder has leant against the facade for 265 years and Ethiopian Christians have long since been exiled to the roof. But there is a catch. Every time I open it, all I want to do is eat. I long for halawa, a sweet I haven’t liked since childhood; I’ve never been more desperate for a warm slice of mutabbaq, the fragrant, sugary pastry that in Jerusalem is folded over melting Nabulsi cheese. Teller writes that the Via Dolorosa branch of Zalatimo’s, a Palestinian baker that has been making mutabbaq since the 19th century, closed its doors in 2019, and this has come as the most terrible news to me (I was last there in 2018). As someone once said, to visit Jerusalem without calling in at Zalatimo’s is not really to visit Jerusalem at all.

2/20/2022,"Eighty years ago, as anti-Japanese fervor gripped the US, the parents and grandparents of the California congressman Mark Takano were among 120,000 Japanese Americans forcibly removed from their homes and sent to desolate camps scattered across the west. They were allowed to take only what they could carry. Everything else was sold, stored or left behind. Confined by barbed wire fences and armed military guards, their only offense was looking like the enemy.  “They were incarcerated without any due process of law, never accused of a crime, never convicted of a crime but in an internment camp strictly because of their racial characteristics,” Takano told the Guardian. Two-thirds of those interned were American citizens, like Takano’s maternal grandparents and paternal grandmother. Many were American-born children, like his parents, far too young to pose a threat to national security, as was the spurious claim. What is remembered as one of the darkest chapters in American history was set in motion on 19 February 1942, 74 days after Japan attacked on Pearl Harbor, when Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066. On the 80th anniversary of Roosevelt’s order, an occasion marked by events from Hawaii to Idaho that will include many witnesses, Takano is worried. “What I fear we’re in now is a moment of forgetting,” he said. Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the US has witnessed an alarming spike in violence and hate against Asian Americans. Toxic rhetoric and attacks on immigrants and racial and religious minorities have become a routine part of the political discourse in democracies around the world. Takano warned of an “insidious nostalgia” that seeks to whitewash the shameful parts of American history. “It’s a hankering for a flawed America,” he said. “And its premise is that America should never evolve.” It was a dangerous worldview, he said, encapsulated by Donald Trump’s promise to “make America great again”. Those who subscribed to it, he continued, “don’t want America to get better. They don’t want to see a more perfect union.” It is why stories like his family’s are worth retelling and remembering. Takano’s paternal grandfather was a teenager when he arrived in the US from Japan in 1916. He worked and saved until he had enough money to marry. So-called alien land laws prevented him from buying property and precluded him from becoming a citizen. But because his grandmother was a citizen, they were able to buy land in her name. In the late 1930s, they purchased a five-acre plot of land in Bellevue, Washington, where they farmed strawberries, chrysanthemums and tomatoes to be sold at Pike’s Place Market in Seattle. When war broke out, they were forced to leave their farm and sent to the Tule Lake internment camp in northern California. Their incarceration lasted until the end of the war, he said. His father bore the physical scars from his internment: burns on his legs from when he fell into an incineration pit. “When he wore short pants, his shins were all discolored,” Takano said. There were emotional scars, too. After their release, Takano said his paternal grandfather, born in Japan, wanted to return. But his paternal grandmother, who was born in America and knew little of Japan, wanted to stay. Takano said the family nearly boarded a ship bound for Japan, but his grandmother experienced a mental breakdown from which he said she never recovered. “To have all of this intersect at once – they get out of the camps but the woes are not over,” he said “You can imagine how stressful and traumatic it was.” Robbed of his property and now his wife’s health, his grandfather raised his young children with the help of his extended family and the tight-knit Japanese American community in southern California. When Takano was 10, he boarded a plane for the first time and flew with his grandfather to Washington. Together they visited the property his family had once owned, “the place where he had had a stake in the American dream and lost it”. At the time, Takano said a Holiday Inn had been built on the land, located in what is now the heart of the state’s prosperous tech industry. Elsewhere, he remembers seeing remnants of the old greenhouses, vestiges of a dream deferred. In the eight decades since Roosevelt signed the order, the federal government as well as state and local governments have sought to make amends. In 1983, the Federal Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians concluded that the incarceration of Japanese Americans was a “grave injustice” motivated by “racial prejudice, war hysteria and failure of political leadership”. Five years later, the US issued a formal apology and paid Japanese American survivors $20,000 each for violations of their civil liberties and constitutional rights. In 2020, California also a formally apologized for the central role it played in the internment of Japanese Americans. Last week, the US Senate passed legislation to create a national historic site on a rural patch of land in south-eastern Colorado known as Camp Amache, where more than 7,000 Japanese Americans and Japanese nationals were imprisoned from 1942 and 1945. In a presidential proclamation commemorating Saturday as a Day of Remembrance, Joe Biden reaffirmed “the Federal Government’s formal apology to Japanese Americans whose lives were irreparably harmed during this dark period of our history, and we solemnly reflect on our collective moral responsibility to ensure that our Nation never again engages in such un-American acts”. “I have always believed that great nations do not ignore their most painful moments – they confront them with honesty and, in doing so, learn from them and grow stronger as a result,” he said. “The incarceration of Japanese Americans 80 years ago is a reminder to us today of the tragic consequences we invite when we allow racism, fear, and xenophobia to fester.” Takano, now chair of the House veterans committee, is particularly proud of his great-uncle, who fought fascism in Europe as part of the US army’s highly decorated 442nd regimental combat team even as his family was interned in the US. “It’s the contradiction of a country that is fighting fascism, but has some of the seeds of it in its own backyard,” he said. His great-uncle died in Italy just weeks before the end of the war in 1945, he said. “I think of my uncle as betting his life on the promise of what America could be and what the world could be,” he said. “And the fact that I’m a member of Congress today I hold out as an example that my uncle won his bet.” But he urged vigilance. “We’re in danger of forgetting and we’re in danger of this nefarious nostalgia,” he said. “These two things put all of that at risk.”",News/US news,"‘We’re in danger of forgetting,’ US warned, 80 years after Japanese American incarceration",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/19/japanese-american-internment-camps
2/20/2022,"Francesco Manni feared for his and his wife’s lives on Friday when, just after 9am, he heard a loud crack and turned to their home office window to see an enormous tree falling towards it. “I just had time to alert my wife, she was sitting close to me and she started shouting,” he said. They were among thousands of people across the UK impacted by the devastation caused by the deadly Storm Eunice.  Thankfully, the tree was so tall that instead of coming through their window, it landed on the roof of their West Reading home, saving them from its impact. But after calling the fire brigade, who rescued Manni, 39, and Jade Dawber, 33, and found the house structurally sound, they woke on Saturday morning to a destroyed garden, cracks in the walls and a damaged roof and gutter. To go outside they had to wear helmets to protect them from falling tiles. “We’ve been really lucky. Basically, if the tree was slightly smaller, by probably a few metres, instead of banging on the top of the house, it would have smashed exactly on the sidewall and inside the window,” said Manni, who works in IT. He hopes that the cost of repairs will be covered by insurance, but following the traumatic experience, he said it was a struggle to sleep because he kept thinking of what had happened. “I saw the whole scene, from the crack to the tree falling towards the house.” He estimates that the tree, which he understands is protected by Reading council and is in his neighbour’s garden, is about 50ft tall and visible from as far as two miles away. On Saturday, as tiles were falling from the roof, he said he “still couldn’t believe it”. “Seeing this massive tree lying in our garden, to be honest we are grateful,” he added. “We are grateful that it could have gone much worse and it didn’t.” In Binfield, Bracknell, Steve Moody told how his and his wife’s cars and garage roof were destroyed when a pine tree, which he estimates was about 20 metres tall, crashed on it. Moody, 71, said: “Both cars are undrivable because they’ve had half the roof fall on top of them. They’ve got broken windows, broken roofs, broken lights. Pretty much anything would break if you dropped a load of clay tiles on it.” They have put in insurance claims but in the meantime will be reliant on buses and walking to get around. He said he was relieved that no trees fell on the house, which he said would have been a disaster, but that it still felt like a “catastrophe”. He added: “It’s a big deal. We’ve been in there this morning when the winds have died down, so there’s a lot to do. I don’t even know how they’d get the tree out of the roof of the building.” In the 30 years that they have lived there, it was the worst storm they have seen. “It’s 35 years really since anything like this happened here,” he said. In Mullion, Cornwall, Ross Hocking said his business, Poldhu Beach Cafe, took a “beating” during the storm, which blew off most of their front roof. The 36-year-old was forced to close because it was too dangerous and the beach and cafe was covered in seafoam so thick it looked like snow. “I was here for maybe 10 minutes max because it was just too dangerous and too wild. You couldn’t stand up,” he said. “I went to just take a photo for our Instagram and it literally took me straight off my feet and blew me over so we called it a day and went home.” After getting in at 7am to clean up, they reopened on Saturday but won’t be able to repair the roof until after the winds have died down. Around the area, he said there were lots of power cuts, missing roofs and fallen down fences and that lots of homes were still without power on Saturday morning. “I’ve had the cafe for 22 years and I’ve never experienced gusts with such power.” In Essex, part of a home was destroyed and car crushed by a 400-year-old oak tree that came through the roof of the family’s house. Dominic Good, 57, was on a work call at home in Stondon Massey, near Brentwood, on Friday morning when he was shocked by an “almighty crash”. The father-of-two said his family are “very lucky” that nobody was injured but that his children’s bedrooms are now filled with rubble and the house covered in dust. “The whole tree fell on the north-west corner of the house and the roof took the brunt of it,” he told the PA news agency. “The roof is pretty much destroyed, and my son’s and my daughter’s bedrooms are completely filled with rubble.” His son, Sven, who was in the room directly below where the tree hit, had his Mazda MX5 “completely crushed” by the tree’s branches. “He just grabbed his laptop and grabbed the dog and ran out of the room,” Good said. Once the tree is removed from the house, he said they will probably have to knock down a significant portion and rebuild it.",News/UK news,"‘The roof is destroyed, and the bedrooms are completely filled with rubble’: Storm Eunice",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/19/the-roof-is-destroyed-and-the-bedrooms-are-completely-filled-with-rubble-storm-eunice
2/20/2022,"The UK’s biggest crisis text line for people needing urgent mental health support gave third-party researchers access to millions of messages from children and other vulnerable users despite a promise never to do so. Shout, a helpline launched with a £3m investment from the Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, says it offers a confidential service for people struggling to cope with issues such as suicidal thoughts, self-harm, abuse and bullying.  An FAQ section on its website had said that while “anonymised and aggregated”, “high-level data” from messages was passed to trusted academic partners for research to improve the service, “individual conversations cannot and will not ever be shared”. But that promise was deleted from the site last year, and access to conversations with millions of people – including children under 13 – has since been given to third-party researchers, the Observer has found. Mental Health Innovations, the charity that runs the helpline, said all users agreed to terms of service that allowed data to be shared with researchers for studies that would “ultimately benefit those who use our service and the broader population”. But the findings have led to a backlash among privacy experts, data ethicists and people who use the helpline, who said the data sharing raised ethical concerns. More than 10.8m messages from 271,445 conversations between February 2018 and April 2020 were used in a project with Imperial College London aimed at creating tools that use artificial intelligence to predict behaviour, including for instance, suicidal thoughts. Personal identifiers including names and phone numbers were removed before the messages were analysed, according to Shout, which says the messages had been “anonymised”. But data used in the research included “full conversations” about people’s personal problems, according to the study. Part of the research was aimed at gleaning personal information about the texters from their messages, such as their age, gender and disability, to get a better understanding of who was using the service. Cori Crider, a lawyer and co-founder of Foxglove, an advocacy group for digital rights, said giving researchers access to the messages raised “serious ethical questions”. “Trust is everything in health – and in mental health most of all. When you start by saying in your FAQs that ‘individual conversations cannot and will not ever be shared’; and suddenly move to training AI on hundreds of thousands of ‘full conversations’, you’ve left behind the feelings and expectations of the vulnerable people you serve,” she said. “It’s particularly sad because this can set back proper consented research by years. Lack of trust in these systems can discourage desperate people from coming forward.” Others raised concerns that people using the service could not truly comprehend how their messages would be used when at crisis point – even if they were told it was going to be used in research – because of their vulnerable state. About 40% of people texting the helpline are suicidal, according to Shout, and many are under 18. Claire Maillet, 30, who used the service for support with anxiety and an eating disorder in 2019 and 2020, said she had no idea messages could be used for research. “My understanding was that the conversation would stay between me and the person I was messaging and wouldn’t go any further,” she said. “If I had known that it would, then I can’t say for certain that I still would have used the service.” Maillet said she “absolutely understood” the need to conduct research in order to “make services better” in cases where people could give their informed consent. But she said using conversations from a crisis helpline raised ethical concerns, even when names were removed, due to the nature of what’s being discussed. “When you’re at that crisis point, you’re not thinking, ‘Will this information be used for research?’ You can spin it in a way that makes it sound good, but it feels like they are exploiting vulnerability in a way.” Phil Booth, coordinator of medConfidential, which campaigns for the privacy of health data, said it was “unreasonable to expect a young person or any person in crisis to be able to understand” that their conversations could be used for purposes other than providing them support. “There are clearly reasons why Shout might need to retain data: no one is denying that. It’s these other uses: they are just not what people would expect.” He added that it was “misleading” and “plainly wrong” that the charity had told users that their individual conversations would not be shared. “If you make a promise like that you should stick to it,” he said. Shout was set up in 2019 as a legacy of Heads Together, a campaign led by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry aimed at ending stigma around mental health. The goal of the service is to provide round-the-clock mental health support to people in the UK, many of whom struggle to access overstretched NHS services, who can text a number and receive a response from a trained volunteer. Mental Health Innovations states that a key goal is to use “anonymised, aggregated data to generate unique insights into the mental health of the UK population”. “We use these insights to enhance our services, to inform the development of new resources and products, and to report on trends of interest for the broader mental health sector,” it says. When service users first contact Shout, they are told: “This is confidential unless we’re worried for your safety and must tell someone to keep you safe.” They are also sent a link to a text with a link to the website and privacy policy with the message: “In using the service you confirm acceptance of our terms and consent to processing of your data.” However, previous versions of the FAQs made a promise that has since been deleted, meaning people who texted the service in the past – including those whose messages were used in the research – are likely to have read information that was later changed. An archived version of the helpline’s website from March 2020 shows that, in the FAQ section, users were told: “We anonymise and aggregate high-level data from conversations in order to study and improve our own performance. We share some of this data with carefully selected and screened academic partners, but the data is always anonymised, individual conversations cannot and will not ever be shared.” In late spring 2021, the FAQ section was updated and the promise about individual conversations removed. The privacy policy was also updated to say that as well as sharing data, it could be used to “enable a deeper understanding of the mental health landscape in the UK more generally”, opening the door to a broader range of uses. The Imperial study, published in December 2021, involved analysis of “entire conversations” manually and using artificial intelligence, according to the paper. To improve the service, it had three goals: predicting the conversation stages of messages, predicting behaviours from texters and volunteers and “classifying full conversations to extrapolate demographic information” – for instance by scanning messages for things such as numbers or mentions of school life, which might indicate a user’s age. “Looking forward, we aim to train models to classify labels that could be considered directly actionable or provide a direct measure of conversation efficacy. For example, a key future aim is prediction of a texter’s risk of suicide,” wrote the researchers. Data was handled in a trusted research environment and the study received ethics approval from Imperial, which said the research “fully complied” with “stringent ethical review policies” and provided “crucial insights”. But Dr Sandra Leaton Gray, associate professor of education at University College London, an expert on the effects of technology on children and young people, said that as a researcher she saw “a lot of red flags” with the secondary data use, including that parental consent was not sought. Dr Christopher Burr, an ethics fellow and expert in AI at the Alan Turing Institute, said responsible data analysis could bring huge benefits. But he said not being clear enough with users about how sensitive conversations would be used created a “culture of distrust”. “They ought to be doing more to ensure their users are meaningfully informed about what’s going on,” he said. The concerns about Shout follow an investigation in the US by the news site Politico that exposed a data-sharing partnership between an American mental health charity and a for-profit company. Shout is the UK counterpart of Crisis Text Line US, which faced intense scrutiny earlier this month over its dealings with Loris.AI, a company that promises to help companies “handle their hard customer conversations with empathy”. After details of the partnership with Loris came to light, Crisis Text Line cut ties with the organisation, and UK users were assured that their data had not been shared with Loris. As well as working with academic researchers, Mental Health Innovations has formed partnerships with private bodies including Hive Learning, a tech company. Hive, whose clients include Boots and Deloitte, worked with Shout to create an AI-powered mental health programme that the firm sells to companies to help them “sustain mass behaviour change at scale”. It is owned by Blenheim Chalcot, “the UK’s leading digital venture builder”, which was founded by Shout trustee Charles Mindenhall. Mental Health Innovations said “no data relating to any texter conversations” had been shared with Hive and that its training programme was “developed with learnings from our volunteer training model”. In a statement, the charitysaid that all data shared with academic researchers, including Imperial, had details including names, addresses, city names, postcodes, email addresses, URLs, phone numbers and social media handles removed, and claimed it was “highly unlikely” that it could be tied to individuals. It said seeking parental consent before using the data in research “would make the service inaccessible for many children and young people”, adding that it understood that texters “desperate for immediate help … may not be able to read the terms and conditions that we send before they start their conversation with us”, but that the privacy policy remained available for them to read at a later stage. If they later decided to withdraw consent, they could text “Loofah” to the helpline number and would have their information deleted, a spokeswoman said. Victoria Hornby, Mental Health Innovations’ chief executive, added that the dataset built from Shout conversations was “unique” because it contained information about “people in their own words”, and could unlock huge benefits in mental health research. She said the promise about individual conversations never being shared was in the FAQs, rather than the actual privacy policy, and had been removed from the website because it could be “easily misunderstood” due to there being “different interpretations” of what “individual conversations” meant. “We didn’t want it to be misunderstood so we changed it,” she said. The Information Commissioner’s Office, the UK’s data protection watchdog, said it was assessing evidence relating to Shout and Mental Health Innovations’ handling of user data. A spokeswoman said: “When handling and sharing people’s health data, especially children’s data, organisations need to take extra care and put safeguards in place to ensure their data is not used or shared in ways they would not expect. We will assess the information and make enquiries on this matter.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.",News/Society,Mental health helpline funded by royals shared users’ conversations,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/19/mental-health-helpline-funded-by-royals-shared-users-conversations
2/20/2022,"Boris Johnson has declared Russia “must fail and be seen to fail” if it invades Ukraine, warning of a bloody and protracted conflict once Russian troops cross the border. In a speech on Saturday to the Munich security conference, which went further than many other speeches condemning Vladimir Putin’s action, Johnson did not rule out 11th-hour diplomacy, but made clear that a Russian victory would send disastrous echoes around the world that the postwar order is being dismantled by force. He said overall the omens were grim.  He said: “If dialogue fails and if Russia chooses to use violence against an innocent and peaceful population in Ukraine, and to disregard the norms of civilised behaviour between states, and to disregard the Charter of the United Nations, then we at this conference should be in no doubt that it is in our collective interest that Russia should ultimately fail and be seen to fail.” He added: “I believe that in preparing to invade Ukraine, a proud country whose armed forces now exceed 200,000 personnel, considerably more expert in combat today than in 2014, President Putin and his circle are gravely miscalculating.” He backed up his remarks in a meeting with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy where the two men agreed an invasion would be met with fierce resistance. Zelenskiy, receiving a standing ovation, told the conference Ukraine is longing for peace and Europe is longing for peace. Zelenskiy had flown from Kyiv to the conference in Germany, despite advice from the US president Joe Biden that it might not be wise to do so. He met Johnson, the US vice-president Kamala Harris and the German chancellor Olaf Scholz, spelling out that he needed more military protection to stave off an invasion. Zelenskiy used much of his 20-minute address to challenge the west about what had happened to its promise of Nato membership, and asked what message the west had for the two soldiers killed on the frontline on Saturday. Zelenskiy called for world leaders to meet to create a new security architecture. He said: “The security architecture of our world is brittle, obsolete and the rules that were agreed dozens of years ago are no longer working. The security system is slow and failing us time and time again.” He blamed “egotism arrogance and irresponsibility at the global level. Some countries resort to crime and others resort to indifference”. “It is too late to fix the current architecture. It is high time for a new one before we pay with millions of casualties.” But he vowed his country would support itself with or without the help of its partners. The conference heard a plethora of world leaders promise severe economic sanctions on Russia if an invasion went ahead, but also various gradations of optimism about whether talks could still find a path to de-escalation. A meeting of G7 foreign ministers chaired by the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, issued a statement of solidarity. Baerbock said: “We are facing the unimaginable concrete threat of a military conflict at the heart of Europe,” adding the world knows Russia must be made responsible for the steps that were unseen since the cold war. She said Russia was behind an orchestrated false flag operation to provide a pretext to launch an attack in Eastern Ukraine. She said: “We are not talking about days, but minutes and hours.” The meeting was attended by the Ukrainian foreign minister She said she did not know if “an attack was a done deal”. A breach of the integrity of the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine would be sufficient to trigger sanctions, but she did not precisely define this phrase, adding there could be different trigger points. Earlier the EU Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, had been the clearest yet on the sanctions being envisaged. “We – the EU and its transatlantic partners – have been preparing a robust package of financial and economic sanctions, including on energy and cutting-edge technology,” she said. “If the Kremlin strikes, we can impose high costs and severe consequences on Moscow’s economic interests. The Kremlin’s dangerous thinking, which comes straight out of a dark past, may cost Russia a prosperous future.” Harris said the United States would reinforce Nato’s eastern flank to act as a further deterrent to any Russian military action in addition to the threat of sanctions.“We have prepared economic measures that will be swift, severe and united,” she said. “We will target Russia’s financial institutions and key industries.” She added those who support the Putin regime and had aided and abetted the invasion would also be targeted. The full Russian playbook of false flag operations was under way, she said, adding the US commitment to Nato’s Article 5 is ironclad. Security officials have warned that Russia has forces in place to invade Ukraine at any moment, and said Moscow could be seeking to create an excuse to invade with a so-called false flag operation. Baerbock urged more OSCE monitors be sent to the region to establish facts on the ground. Russia opened an investigation on Saturday into Russian media reports that a Ukrainian shell exploded in Russia’s region of Rostov about 1 kilometre (0.6 miles) from the border. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said it was unacceptable that a war in Europe was imminent over Russia’s demand that Ukraine’s path to Nato membership be blocked, when Putin knew such membership was not on the agenda. He also described as ridiculous claims by Putin that a genocide was under way in the Donbass.",News/World news,"Russia ‘must fail and be seen to fail’ if it invades Ukraine, says Johnson",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/19/russia-johnson-munich-security-conference-putin-ukraine
