12/30/2021,"I don’t ever want to hear about Texas A&M’s “12th Man” again after the Aggies pulled out of the Gator Bowl because “we just don’t have enough scholarship players available to field a team,” according to head coach Jimbo Fisher. (Dec. 23, 1B, “Texas A&M pulls out of Gator Bowl due to COVID-19”) If the reason for pulling out of the game was a concern for the welfare and safety of the players, then OK. But to say the reason is a lack of “scholarship players” relegates the “12th Man” to meaningless status and ignores the institution’s football history, dating to Jan. 1, 1922, when a student left the stands to suit up for an injury-depleted Aggies team. - Tom Leferink, Arlington Two articles in the Dec. 22 newspaper declared that the Department of Homeland Security will allocate 20,000 visas for citizens of Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and Haiti but deny requests by Afghans seeking safety in the U.S. (12A, “Thousands more work visas OK’d for Central Americans and Haitians”; “US starts denying Afghans’ requests to enter country”) These Afghans are being persecuted and killed by the Taliban. Afghan citizens have to jump through hoops to show they are being persecuted and face death threats daily, yet these Latin American people can simply say they are afraid of gangs and they are allowed in. What’s wrong with this picture? These Afghans helped our soldiers throughout the war, and President Joe Biden is kicking these families when they need our help the most. - Donna Bierd, Keller Many of us remember one person in our lives who gave us a chance to prove ourselves. For me, that was former House Speaker Jim Wright. In 1982, the Fort Worth congressman hired me as a summer intern, and I became a permanent staffer to the second-most powerful person in the U.S. for nine years. As a result, I was able to finish college and law school at night while working for the man I greatly admired. I ask all of you to think of that one person in your lives and drop them a note of appreciation during the holidays. Let them know how much they have meant to you. - Yong J. An, Houston On Dec. 16, the legitimately elected president awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor to three members of our armed forces, two of whom gave their lives for their country and for those they were serving with. These three, as well as all service members who give their lives or their bodies to serve and protect the United States, are the true patriots. If you have not seen the ceremony, watch it, and keep a tissue at hand. The Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol was not carried out by patriots but by puppets maneuvered by the former president and his minions. Our democracy is at risk if we do not recognize this soon. - Floyd S. Ostrom, Arlington Erin Lowry’s Dec. 22 commentary on the declining financial benefits of marriage was significantly flawed. (13A, “No, getting married isn’t always financially beneficial”) People who get married for financial benefits don’t really have a marriage anyway, just a legal contract. Affection and moral commitments should be the reasons for marriage. The liberal thought process advanced in this column is one reason for the decline of the American family and family values. It even suggests that government benefits don’t favor marriage. God help us. - Ken Sapp, Granbury",U.S./Fort Worth Star-Telegram,"After the Aggies’ Gator Bowl stunt, don’t talk to me about the ‘12th Man’ ever again",https://news.yahoo.com/aggies-gator-bowl-stunt-don-110000411.html
12/30/2021,"BEIRUT (AP) — Satellite images taken this week over the Syrian port of Latakia show the smoldering wreckage after a reported Israeli missile strike, hours after firefighters contained a massive blaze. The raid launched from the Mediterranean Sea Tuesday was among the biggest launched by Israel into Syria, igniting a fire in the container terminal that raged for hours and caused significant material damage in the vicinity. It damaged a nearby hospital and offices, and also shattered windows of residential buildings and cars parked in the area near the port. The explosion could be heard miles away. It was the second such attack on the facility this month. The Latakia seaport handles most of the imports to Syria, a country ravaged by a decade-old civil war and Western-imposed sanctions. Another attack took place Dec. 7, when Syrian media reported Israeli warplanes hit the container terminal, also igniting a major fire. Satellite photos obtained by The Associated Press from Planet Labs PBC Thursday showed heavy smog over the container terminal on Wednesday, likely from the struck container still smoking. The images suggest it was a high precision strike that appeared to hit one container. A Syrian military official said the Israeli missiles were fired from the sea, west of Latakia, hitting the terminal and igniting fires. Maj. Mohannad Jafaar, head of the Latakia fire department, said 12 fire trucks worked for hours to contain the blaze. He said the containers that were hit held spare auto parts and oil but there were no casualties. The Israeli military, which rarely comments on individual attacks or discusses details of such operations, declined to comment on the reported strike. Israel says it targets bases of Iran-allied militias, such as Lebanon’s militant Hezbollah group, which has fighters in Syria. It says it attacks arms shipments believed to be bound for the militias.",World/Associated Press,Satellite images show smoldering wreckage at Syria port,https://news.yahoo.com/satellite-images-show-smoldering-wreckage-112453256.html
