5/10/2022,"Russia is taping basic GPS systems to the dashboards of Su-34 fighter jets, the UK defense minister said. Ben Wallace said this was due to ""the poor quality"" of Russia's own navigation systems. Russia's military hardware, much of which is outdated, is being tested as the invasion drags on. Wrecked Russian fighter jets are being found with rudimentary GPS receivers ""taped to the dashboards"" in Ukraine because their inbuilt navigation systems are so bad, the UK defense minister said. Speaking at the National Army Museum in London on Monday, Ben Wallace commemorated those who died in World War II and called Russia's invasion of Ukraine ""senseless and self-defeating."" He also said there was evidence suggesting Russian military hardware was being pushed to breaking point by the invasion of Ukraine. ""'GPS' receivers have been found taped to the dashboards of downed Russian Su-34s so the pilots knew where they were, due to the poor quality of their own systems,"" he said. ""The result is that whilst Russia have large amounts of artillery and armor that they like parading, they are unable to leverage them for combined arms maneuver and just resort to mass indiscriminate barrages."" The Su-34 was first manufactured during the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, but is still one of Russia's leading fighter jets. Ukraine has shared abundant evidence of what it says are Russia's attempts to patch over issues with old military equipment and bypass equipment shortages. Last month, Ukrainian troops paraded a Russian drone that had been covered in duct tape and fitted with a generic plastic bottle top for a fuel cap. In late March, Ukrainian troops found Russian army bandages dating back to 1978 discarded on a battlefield. In his Monday speech, Wallace also said Russian vehicles ""are frequently found with 1980s paper maps of Ukraine in them"" and that soldiers are using ""pine logs as makeshift protection on logistical trucks"" and attaching ""overhead 'cope cages' to their tanks."" Russia held its annual May 9 ""Victory Day"" military parade in Moscow on Monday, but canceled the air force fly-by due to what it said was bad weather. During his speech, President Vladimir Putin didn't declare all-out war on Ukraine as Western officials including Wallace had expected, instead praising the valor of Russian troops fighting in the eastern Donbas region and slamming NATO and the US.

5/10/2022,"Russian authorities in Ukraine’s occupied city of Donetsk are tossing the bodies of their dead soldiers in a secret dump “by the thousands” and charging their loved ones money to find them. That’s according to a new audio recording released by Ukraine’s Security Service on Tuesday, which is purportedly an intercepted telephone conversation between two Russians discussing how one of their missing friends was finally found. In the two-and-a-half minute recording, an unidentified man tells his female relative that the fate of “Inna’s brother” is finally known after he went missing a month ago. “It’s better that you don’t hear this,” the man says at first, reluctant to spill all the grim details. After more urging, he finally explains that the unidentified dead man’s “sister went to Donetsk, and there, basically, roughly speaking, is a dump.” The Only Winners at Putin’s Victory Day Parade? The Hackers Who Took Over Russian TV “They just toss them there. And then later it’s easier to make as if they disappeared without a trace. It’s easier for them to pretend they are just missing, and that’s it,” he said, noting that “there are thousands.” “There’s nowhere left to place them. It’s a dump. I’m telling you in plain Russian—a dump. It’s as tall as a person,” he said, adding that the site is “fenced off, sealed, they don’t let anyone in.” According to him, the only reason local authorities at the dump site let the woman find her brother was because she paid “good money.” Watch: Wiretaps appear catch Russian soldiers sabotaging their own equipment After that, he said, “they rearranged it until she found [the body.]” “It’s not a morgue, it’s a dump.… They are bringing [bodies] by the thousands,” he said, calling it a “shitshow.” No further details were provided by Ukrainian intelligence on the exact location of the makeshift morgue, and it was not immediately clear if the man heard in the audio was a Russian soldier himself, though Ukrainian authorities described him as an “invader.” The disturbing intercept comes after Al Jazeera on Monday released footage of refrigerated train cars holding the unclaimed bodies of Russian troops killed in Ukraine. Inside, there appeared to be human-size bodies stacked on top of each other in white bags. Ukrainian authorities said Moscow has refused to take the bodies back home, apparently to keep the lid on the sky-high death toll. While Russia has claimed only 1,300 of its troops have died in its “special military operation” to rescue Russian-speakers in Ukraine (by bombing predominantly Russian-speaking areas), Ukraine’s military has put the death toll at about 26,000.

5/10/2022,"Trump's former Pentagon chief claims Trump wanted to punish former top military commanders who criticized him. Mark Esper writes that Trump wanted to court-martial retired Adm. William McRaven and retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal. Esper says Trump's ire was spun up by stories in publications like Breitbart. Former President Donald Trump wanted to take the extraordinary step of reactivating retired US Navy Adm. William McRaven so that he could court-martial the former Navy SEAL commander for criticizing him, Trump's former Pentagon chief claims in his new book. Former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper writes that he and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley had to talk then-President Trump out of a plan to recall both retired US Army Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal and McRaven to active duty as a way to open the two former senior military officers up to court-martial proceedings. ""Doing this 'will backfire on you, Mr. President,' we said,"" Esper wrote of a May 2020 meeting in his book ""A Sacred Oath: Memoirs of a Secretary of Defense During Extraordinary Times,"" which is out today. Trump told Esper and Milley that McRaven and McChrystal were ""so disloyal"" because of what they were doing and had said about him. Esper writes that Trump was ""spun up"" by media stories in Breitbart alleging that McChrystal was advising Democrats on how to use artificial intelligence to ""track down and counter Trump supporters."" Both McRaven and McChrystal had also crossed Trump in the past, which only further inflamed the president. In 2018, McChrystal — who served as the head of the Joint Special Operations Command from 2003 to 2008 and later was appointed head of all international forces in Afghanistan — criticized Trump's decision to remove US troops from Syria and said he believed Trump was immoral and doesn't ""tell the truth."" McRaven, the former head of US Special Operations Command whose military career included leading Operation Neptune Spear targeting al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, was a frequent critic of Trump throughout his presidency. Shortly after Trump's inauguration, McRaven criticized the president's continued attacks on members of the media, arguing it was ""the greatest threat to democracy"" in his lifetime. In a 2017 Washington Post column, McRaven said the Trump White House decision to revoke the security clearance of former CIA Director John Brennan was an effort to ""suppress freedom of speech and punish critics"" and said he would ""consider it an honor"" if his security clearance was also revoked. McRaven gave a number of media interviews and wrote several more op-eds criticizing Trump during his presidency. While it is not uncommon for retired military officers to give their opinion for or against a president, McRaven's comments attracted significantly more attention due to his rank and notoriety. Milley, Esper writes, finally got Trump to back down from his threat by promising to ""personally call the officers and ask them to dial it back."" McChrystal told Talking Points Memo that he did not remember receiving such a call from Milley. A spokesperson for Milley did not respond to a request for comment. Esper writes in his book that the entire episode was emblematic of a White House that constantly pushed, if not sometimes crossing, the line between politics and the management of America's defense. Loyalty purges, Esper writes, targeted both current and former commanders. ""Worse yet, people were removed from positions simply because the White House wanted to replace them with more hard-core Trump loyalists, regardless of qualifications,"" writes Esper, who often drew Trump's ire and was fired and replaced shortly after Trump's loss in the 2020 election. Trump, in response to the publication of Esper's book, repeatedly called his former Pentagon chief ""Yesper"" and claimed that he had to effectively ""run the military"" himself.
