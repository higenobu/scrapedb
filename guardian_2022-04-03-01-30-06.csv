4/3/2022,"Dominic Cummings has accused Boris Johnson of encouraging attacks on junior civil servants over the “partygate” scandal in order to protect himself and his wife Carrie. The prime minister’s onetime senior aide said senior officials had “turned a blind eye” to his behaviour. He referred to briefing against one No 10 private secretary, Hannah Young. It has emerged that her leaving party on 18 June led to the first fines announced this week. Reports after some of the parties involving civil servants included a staff member breaking a swing in the garden belonging to the Johnsons’ son Wilfred, a suitcase of alcohol being purchased from a nearby Co-op and one staff member acting as a DJ. A total of 20 fixed-penalty notices have been issued to staff who broke lockdown rules. Johnson had previously told parliament when the allegations first came to light in November 2021 that “all guidance was followed completely in No 10”. In his latest blog, with an excerpt posted on Twitter, Cummings said: “It is deeply, deeply contemptible that not just the PM but senior civil servants have allowed such people to have their reputations attacked in order to protect the sociopathic narcissist squatting in the No10 flat. “Not just ‘allowed’ – everybody at the centre of events also knows that the PM encouraged the media attacks on junior officials in order to divert the lobby’s attention from him and Carrie breaking the law. Some very senior officials have turned a blind eye.” Carrie is reported to have had parties in their Downing Street flat, while Boris had a surprise birthday party in 2020 attended by up to 30 staff, as well as the couple’s interior designer, Lulu Lytle. Young “did a truly phenomenal job”, and “made us all safer” during Covid and while coordinating a response to a terrorist incident, Cummings said. On Friday officials in Downing Street started to get emails saying they were being fined £50 for attending parties, days after the Metropolitan police confirmed they were handing out the notices. Detectives are investigating 12 events in 2020 and 2021, six of which Johnson is said to have been at. The Met has said it has received more than 300 photographs and 500 pages of documents after a Whitehall inquiry by senior civil servant Sue Gray. In an appearance before a parliamentary select committee and in statements from his spokesperson after the fines this week, Johnson refused to accept that the law had been broken. In response to a question from the Scottish National party MP Pete Wishart during his Commons liaison committee session, Johnson said: “I have been, I hope, very frank with the House about where I think we have gone wrong and the things that I regret, and I apologise for, but there is an ongoing investigation. “I understand the point you’re making, but … I have been very clear I won’t give running commentary on an ongoing investigation.” Cummings also criticised fines for junior officials over Johnson’s then principal private secretary Martin Reynolds, despite having organised and attended a party in the cabinet secretary’s office. “Over the last few days, many junior officials have been fined for attending an event that the PM’s PPS organised. “The PPS … was responsible for ensuring that events in No 10 were consistent not just with the rules but with basic ethical standards.” No 10 has been approached for comment.",News/Politics,Cummings accuses PM of encouraging attacks on junior staff over No 10 parties,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/02/cummings-accuses-pm-of-encouraging-attacks-on-junior-staff-over-no-10-parties
4/3/2022,"The comic actor Jim Carrey has said that he is “fairly serious” about retiring after his latest film in an interview. The actor, best known for leading roles in films including Bruce Almighty, The Mask and How The Grinch Stole Christmas, said his current reprisal of Dr Robotnik in the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 would probably be his last. “Well, I’m retiring. Yeah, probably. I’m being fairly serious,” the 60-year-old told Access Hollywood. “It depends. If the angels bring some sort of script that’s written in gold ink that says to me that it’s going to be really important for people to see, I might continue down the road, but I’m taking a break.” He added: “I really like my quiet life and I really like putting paint on canvas and I really love my spiritual life and I feel like – and this is something you might never hear another celebrity say as long as time exists – I have enough. I’ve done enough. I am enough.” His response was in answer to a question about starring in a film about Dolly Parton’s life, after the country singer said she would like him to play her one-time musical partner, Porter Wagoner. Carrey has previously taken long breaks from acting in major films. Before first appearing in the Sonic the Hedgehog movie in 2020, he had a four-year break from acting since appearing in Dark Crimes and the Bad Batch in 2016. It comes in a week where he said he was “sickened” by the Oscars’ standing ovation for Will Smith when he won the award for best actor for King Richard. The applause came on the same night that he had hit host Chris Rock after he made a joke made about Smith’s wife Jada’s alopecia.",Arts/Film,Jim Carrey ‘fairly serious’ about retiring after latest film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/02/jim-carrey-fairly-serious-about-retiring-after-latest-film
4/3/2022,"This was a game that spiralled into an ill-tempered contest between rivals 12 miles apart but by then Wolves had already wounded Aston Villa and they eked out victory to climb into seventh and maintain their hopes of achieving a European berth. The Wolves support delighted in doing the double over Villa this season, smarting about the 13-point gap between the teams, Steven Gerrard acknowledging anything but victory here would end their hopes of superseding their rivals this season. At full time the Wolves captain Conor Coady jumped into Jose Sá’s arms after his goalkeeper prevented Villa scoring a late equaliser. Wolves collapsed against Leeds last time out and Ollie Watkins ensured an anxious finish after winning and then converting a late penalty but the hosts held on to leapfrog West Ham, who play Everton on Sunday. Bruno Lage had conceded that whether Wolves could cope without both the suspended Raúl Jiménez and the injured Rúben Neves was a question unanswered in his head but the first half provided compelling evidence that he need not fret. Wolves should have had a three-goal advantage at the interval, Leander Dendoncker skewering painfully wide after a counterattack from an Aston Villa corner and Trincão’s unusually poor touch putting pay to his hopes of converting Fábio Silva’s centre on the brink of half-time. Lage was apoplectic but compared to Gerrard, arms folded in the dugout, his complaints would have been relatively trivial. Wolves had to settle for a two-goal lead at the break, Jonny Otto leathering home at the back post on seven minutes before Ashley Young, who replaced Lucas Digne 13 minutes into his return from a hamstring injury, inadvertently converted Marçal’s teasing cross past Emiliano Martínez in the Villa goal. The opener stemmed from Silva knocking John McGinn off balance on halfway, allowing the typically authoritative João Moutinho to drive upfield and float a pass towards Daniel Podence, who looked to make the most of an untimely slip by Ezri Konsa. But while Podence was guilty of overcomplicating things, McGinn able to block his shot before Silva was denied, the ball dropped kindly for Jonny to arrow into the corner. Forty seconds later, Villa were wayward and Silva got the better of Tyrone Mings but his tame shot represented comfortable pickings for Martínez. Villa’s waywardness made a mockery of Gerrard’s early gesturing for calm. Wolves, by contrast, were enjoying themselves. The Sir Jack Hayward Stand rejoiced as Young’s own goal was replayed in slow motion on the big screens. Marçal, a reliable outlet down the left flank, galloped forward and his cross bounced dangerously on the edge of the six-yard box, luring Young into heading past Martinez under pressure from Trincão at the back post. The Wolves substitute Hwang Hee-chan went close to adding a third with 20 minutes to play but pulled his shot wide after Moutinho moseyed forward before a back-pedalling Mings intervened, while Silva, the teenager who grew in confidence, forced Martínez into a fine save with a curled effort late on. Aside from Leon Bailey, one of three changes from last time out against Arsenal, prompting a fingertip save from Sá from distance the Wolves goalkeeper was untroubled in the first half but he should have been fishing the ball out of his net on 56 minutes. A Wolves counterattack broke down and Young fed Watkins in on goal with a wonderful through pass but the England striker fluffed his lines. Watkins attempted to caress a shot into the far corner beyond Sá but dropped his shot wide of a post. Watkins would get on the scoresheet, sending Sá the wrong way from the penalty spot with four minutes to play, but Villa departed empty-handed.",Sport/Football,Jonny Otto on target as Wolves hold on for victory against Aston Villa,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/02/wolves-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report
4/3/2022,"It has been another eventful week in the weird world of Chelsea, where supporter dissent against the Ricketts family’s controversial bid to buy the club shows no sign of dying down, but few people could have imagined that it would end with Brentford turning up here and giving the European champions a footballing lesson. Before the inquest into Chelsea’s failings begin, it is important to stress that Brentford were superb: aggressive in the press, clever with the ball and tactically astute as they earned their first victory in this fixture since 1939. As Thomas Frank will no doubt acknowledge, it was worth the wait. After a lean run of form, this was Brentford returning to their best and rediscovering the zest that made them so compelling to watch at the start of the season. Chelsea simply had no response, even though they took the lead when Antonio Rüdiger finally ended his quest for a goal from long range with a scorching drive at the start of the second half, and in the end the only consolation for Thomas Tuchel was that his side had not lost by more. There could be no complaints from Tuchel. Brentford were simply the better team and the only problem for Frank was working out which of his players had impressed most. It was not just about Ivan Toney and Bryan Mbeumo delivering performances full of craft and athleticism up front. This was a remarkable team effort, enlivened by a dynamic goalscoring display from Vitaly Janelt in midfield, and in terms of romance it was impossible to top the moment when Christian Eriksen found himself all alone in the Chelsea area and lifted the ball over Édouard Mendy to give Brentford a richly deserved lead nine minutes into a wonderfully thrilling second half. It will go down as one of the most emotional moments of the season. Brentford had already shown character after falling behind to Rüdiger’s astonishing opener, Toney and Mbeumo combining to set up an instant equaliser for Janelt, but the best was still to come. They were soon storming forward again after clearing a Chelsea corner and when Mbeumo looked inside for support after tearing away down the left he saw Eriksen all alone in the middle, waiting for the ball and the chance to put them ahead. Happily for Eriksen, who also scored for Denmark during the international break, Mbeumo’s cross was perfectly weighted. It tempted Mendy off his line but the Chelsea goalkeeper could not get there. The moment belonged to Eriksen and Brentford, whose decision to sign the Dane in January after he almost died from a cardiac arrest last summer looks like smart business on this evidence, were ahead. Chelsea could not cope with Eriksen’s clever passing and soon fell apart. They fell further behind when Toney released Janelt to chip Mendy and there would be more pain in the dying stages, Rüdiger’s errant header giving Yoann Wissa the opportunity to make it 4-1 and take Brentford 11 points above the bottom three with seven matches left. Chelsea had been tense from the start. They were uncomfortable under Brentford’s high press, Marcos Alonso a repeat offender when it came to giving possession away cheaply during the early stages, and the visitors had chances. The first came when Mendy sent a stray pass straight to Toney, who wafted his shot over the bar, and another arrived when Eriksen sent Mads Roerslev haring beyond Alonso on the right. The cross reached Mbeumo, who fed Toney to test Mendy. There was another opportunity for Brentford when Rico Henry found space on the left and crossed for Toney to head over at the far post. Chelsea were rockingwith Brentford’s 5-3-2 system causing problems, and Tuchel was growing more animated. The manager was unhappy with Timo Werner’s lack of movement on the left and it was a while before Chelsea gained a semblance of control, Mason Mount and Ruben Loftus-Cheek threatening from the edge of the area. Brentford were defending well, their diligence ensuring that there were few opportunities for Kai Havertz to express himself at the tip of Chelsea’s attack. Only Hakim Ziyech threatened, the Moroccan’s bending effort drawing a fine save from David Raya. Had Brentford’s moment passed? It seemed that way when Rüdiger stepped forward from the back and unleashed a thunderous drive from 30 yards, the ball clipping the inside of the right post as it flew past Raya. Yet Brentford’s response was rapid. They were level immediately, capitalising when Chelsea fell apart in midfield. Toney found Mbeumo and the striker touched the ball on to Janelt, who arrived untracked from midfield to smash an excellent shot past Mendy. Chelsea were stunned. Havertz had a goal ruled out for handball but it made no difference. They will need to improve when they host Real Madrid in the Champions League on Wednesday.",Sport/Football,Brentford stun Chelsea as Christian Eriksen helps inspire wild comeback,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/02/chelsea-brentford-premier-league-match-report
4/3/2022,"Uniforms are one of the most deceptive trappings of military culture. They suggest uniformity but it is often said of the British army that if two officers look the same, one must be improperly dressed. Armies, and especially professional armies, are more often warring tribes of subcultures, and for commanders it is critical to understand how those cultures interact if the force is to be employed effectively in battle. When it comes to Russian military culture, the Russian army has been through a period of significant change, with constant modernisation since 2008. The Soviet Union fielded an army of more than 3.5 million soldiers in 1991. The Soviet army was largely a conscript force and lacked an experienced noncommissioned officer corps. This meant that Soviet units had to be treated with a degree of uniformity, since the personnel rotated so frequently that most line units were necessarily commanded using set formulas that formed the basis for unit training. Today’s Russian military is much smaller with about 1 million personnel across all services. For the army, conscripts today make up only about 35% of the force. The high proportion of contract soldiers should produce a more distinct unit culture. This is reinforced by how units have been fighting. Among Russia’s higher-readiness forces, the wars in Ukraine and Syria have seen fighting being conducted primarily at the level of the company group, producing units with contract troops who have fought together, but rarely in large formations. This process of experience being concentrated into small units of action has been further accelerated by the expansion of Russian special purpose units. FSB (security service) units have for a long time been focused on repressive counter-terrorism alongside Chechen troops, who are well equipped but largely lack experience of heavy fighting. GU and KSO “special purpose troops”, meanwhile, have tended to operate in small teams – sometimes down to pairs – behind enemy lines. Although the Russian officer corps has been rotated through Donbas and Syria, the scale of activity they managed there has been limited. As well as disparities in experience between Russian military units, there is also the different geographic focus of various formations. Russia spans 11 time zones, and consequently its military districts are confronted with very different problems. The Western Military District was positioned to confront Nato. The Southern Military District was set up for expeditionary operations. The Northern Military District is responsible for the high north, and the Eastern Military District guards Vladivostok and the Chinese border. Because formations in these regions are aligned to a variety of threats, they receive different equipment, with the eastern district usually the last to get upgraded vehicles and gear. The challenge that Russia has struggled to address is that while its force has become increasingly fragmented into units where experience is largely confined to company-sized or at most battalion-sized actions, Russia’s political aspirations have far exceeded the capacity of these formations. Battalion tactical groups operating under independent brigades, for example, proved logistically inadequate in 2015, leading to the reintroduction of divisions to manage supply. Preparing for the war in Ukraine, Russia has drawn troops from across its military districts, fielding 190,000 personnel from units that have rarely worked together and that use a wide range of equipment of varying vintage. Further complexity emerges from the mobilisation of raw recruits from the occupied Luhansk and Donetsk enclaves, the deployment of interior riot police and Rosgvardia (national guard) troops, meant for crowd control rather than warfighting, and Wagner mercenaries. Some Rosgvardia personnel have refused to deploy to Ukraine. Wagner include some experienced soldiers, though their track record in offensive operations is poor. They have also not previously participated in large-scale Russian military exercises, making it ambiguous how they are to be commanded in the field. Planning to deploy such a diverse force would usually require careful consideration as to how units with different equipment, experience, culture and training levels would interact and complement one another. The sequencing of which units would attack first would be carefully worked out. Instead, these units have largely been committed piecemeal, using the same roads, with limited efforts to establish effective control measures or assign battlespace. Although units were given markings to indicate their axis of advance, many formations have become intermingled, causing friendly fire incidents and confusion, and cratering morale. Slowly, Russian senior officers have begun to impose order on operations, but with too many troops pushed forward, too few reserves and insufficient logistical support, they are paying a heavy price for early blunders. In many respects, the Russian military has been caught between its political aspirations to fight large wars, and the experience of its soldiers, which has been confined to small ones.

4/3/2022,"Liverpool had a brief time to enjoy the sight of the league table. Then came the confirmation that while overtaking Manchester City was an achievement, finishing above them will be a far greater one. If City had a two-hour sojourn in second, it only took Pep Guardiola’s team four minutes to demonstrate they would reclaim the status they held for four months. Leaders since December, briefly deposed by Liverpool, City’s opener came so quickly that Jürgen Klopp was able to reference it in his post-match interviews after the 2-0 win over Watford at Anfield. Statements of intent are rarely quicker or more eloquent. If City, 14 points clear of Liverpool in January, passed a psychological test as they looked utterly unruffled by the temporary shift in the pecking order, they played with the assurance of a team with little need to worry about scorelines elsewhere. They dispatched Burnley with a performance of elegant dominance. They did it their way: while Klopp has forwards as potent as Diogo Jota, City share the goals around and Kevin De Bruyne and Ilkay Gündogan struck. Perhaps it summed up a team’s ethos that the latter passed the ball into the net. Long before half-time, the visiting City fans were sufficiently confident of victory that their attention turned to past heroes. While they celebrated Pablo Zabaleta and Yaya Touré in song, the current class excelled. Raheem Sterling was a selfless supplier for two goals, running past, beyond and behind Charlie Taylor at will. After his evolution into a scorer, his outings on the right are rarities these days but Sterling rewound the clock to turn provider. His performance lacked only the finish and he miscued a volley, following a delightful pass from Phil Foden, but his crossing was more accurate. Burnley’s narrow tactics also afforded João Cancelo freedom and he was predictably influential, part full-back, part playmaker. In the middle, Rodri ran the game, but he will rarely have an easier match. The Burnley of cliche, the obdurate opponents who frustrate their supposed superiors with abrasiveness and organisation, were nowhere to be seen. Ominously, given the growing probability of relegation, they looked a side shorn of spirit. Such fight as Burnley displayed was of the wrong variety: Wout Weghorst was fortunate to escape with a yellow card for elbowing Cancelo. City have long specialised in swatting Burnley aside in more legitimate ways. This was a 10th straight win against them and as the aggregate score now stands at 34-1, technically it is one of Burnley’s better results in that sequence. Perhaps that miserable record prompted Sean Dyche to change tack. His fondness for 4-4-2 is famous but he opted to include an extra midfielder. If the intention was to keep it tight, the game was gone before Maxwel Cornet was summoned at half-time and Ederson was not tested until the replacement Jay Rodriguez’s 75th-minute shot. Briefly, however, Dyche may have sensed early vindication. Josh Brownhill had the licence to break from deep to join Weghorst and, when Aaron Lennon whipped in a cross, he met it with an emphatic header from the edge of box that flew just wide. Thereafter, Dyche’s plans backfired. While Burnley fielded three largely defensive midfielders, within 25 minutes City’s central trio had mustered five shots, all while essentially unmarked, and scored twice. Rodri twice came close in the opening 10 minutes. His sidekicks found the finishing touch, each after emerging unchecked in the inside-right channel. When Rodri angled a cross to the far post, Taylor allowed Sterling too much room to tee up De Bruyne. His finish was emphatic, rasping and rising. De Bruyne and Sterling combined again for the second, exchanging passes as the England player sped clear to chip in a cross. Gündogan timed his arrival in the penalty box to cushion a volley past Nick Pope. The goalkeeper was required to excel, especially when Foden improvised a backheeled shot. The substitute Gabriel Jesus volleyed over and then struck the post. If the title is decided by goal difference, City may yet regret not turning their superiority into further strikes. Instead, their thoughts turned to Atlético Madrid.",Sport/Football,Kevin De Bruyne and Ilkay Gündogan help Manchester City ease past Burnley,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/02/burnley-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report
4/3/2022,"Jesse Marsch describes Ralph Hasenhüttl as a gentleman, a mentor, a gifted pianist and a good friend. Given that Southampton’s manager is similarly complimentary about about his Leeds counterpart it was perhaps appropriate that no one lost an always entertaining match which leaves Marsch’s side eight points clear of the bottom three. Leeds have clearly improved in the month since the American succeeded Marcelo Bielsa but they have not yet quite banished their relegation fears and could do with winning at Watford next Saturday. The warmth of the managers’ greetings was testament to the seven weeks Marsch, then managing the MLS team New York Red Bulls spent shadowing Hasenhuttl - not to mention listening to him playing the piano - at Leipzig in the winter of 2016-17. Southampton arrived still stuck in a bit of a bleak mid-winter of their own. Aiming to arrest a run of four straight defeats, they swiftly found themselves penned in their own half by the attacking aggression of a Leeds side bolstered by two consecutive wins. At first, Marsch’s players dominated without causing Hasenhüttl’s England goalkeeper Fraser Forster too much real danger. Although Rodrigo’s movement and link play and Dan James’s searing change of pace gave Southampton a few frights Forster remained largely well protected by the impressive Mohammed Salisu and his defenders until the 29th minute. With the visiting backline finally confounded by Raphinha’s right wing cross, the visiting goalkeeper could merely parry that delivery, leaving the ball travelling only as far as Jack Harrison whose scoring half-volley sent Elland Road’s already high decibel level soaring. That explosion of noise possibly woke Southampton up as, almost immediately, they improved appreciably, forcing Illan Meslier into an excellent save involving the Frenchman diving low to his left to deny Che Adams from 10 yards. By this point Leeds had lost a little of their early intensity and it did not come as a total surprise when, four minutes into the second half, Hasenhüttl’s team equalised, courtesy of James Ward-Prowse’s party trick. The midfielder’s latest goal from a free-kick featured a 25-yard dead ball delivery which arced imperiously over the wall before exhibiting fiendish swerve en route to the top corner. Although Meslier got his fingertips in the way the sheer quality of Ward-Prowse’s execution ensured he had no chance of securing any real purchase on the ball. Presumably sensing the game slipping from his team’s grasp, Marsch made a couple of significant changes, introducing, first his young striker Joe Gelhardt and then, to the most raucous of ovations, Kalvin Phillips. The England defensive midfielder had been sidelined by hamstring trouble since early December and his arrival on the pitch seemed to reassure those home fans unnerved by the sight of Armando Broja spurning an excellent chance to put Southampton in front by steering Valentino Livramento’s cross narrowly wide. With Leeds showing signings of re-gaining some momentum Hasenhüttl decided it was time to slow things down whenever possible and his side’s time wasting tactics did not go down overly well with locals.",Sport/Football,James Ward-Prowse earns point for Southampton to stall Leeds’ progress ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/02/leeds-southampton-premier-league-match-report
4/3/2022,"Almost 5 million people in the UK are now believed to have Covid-19, it was estimated last week – an all-time high figure for the disease which first struck the nation two years ago. Hospital admissions and deaths are also rising but not nearly so sharply, scientists added. This sharp jump in case numbers is being driven by the virus variant BA.2 which is even more transmissible than the original Omicron version that swept the UK at the beginning of the year. The latest wave comes just as the government has ended free testing for the virus and as the nation prepares to enjoy its Easter holidays. This prospect raises the fear that further increases in case numbers, followed by rises in hospital admissions and deaths, could afflict the UK. But as other researchers have pointed out, spring has arrived and warmer weather will allow more and more people to mix out of doors where they are less likely to infect each other. The outcome is unclear, in short. So what is the likely trajectory of the disease for the rest of the year? And what key measures should be taken now to limit the spread of Covid-19? Should mask-wearing regulations remain strict? “I don’t think so, unless you are someone who is particularly vulnerable,” says Professor Paul Hunter, of the University of East Anglia. “The latest ONS characteristics survey doesn’t find much benefit of mask wearing any more – though that does not mean masks don’t work. It is probably just that people who haven’t been wearing masks are more likely to have had the infection already and so are less susceptible.” This point was backed by Professor Rowland Kao, of Edinburgh University. “With all other restrictions pretty much removed, we have very little evidence that cloth masks, such as commonly worn, have much effectiveness against Omicron, due to its higher transmissibility.” However, the vaccine expert Peter English argues that mask-wearing still has an important role to play in limiting the spread of Covid. “Masks are particular effective for source control – at preventing an infectious person from infecting others. And there are people who remain at high risk from Covid-19. They cannot protect themselves as well as they need to by wearing a mask themselves. They rely on others to protect them by masking up in enclosed public spaces.” Can we expect UK infections to peak soon? Yes, says Professor Sheila Bird, of Cambridge University. “With respect to Omicron BA.2, it will probably peak in the next couple of weeks in England and Wales to be followed in two to three weeks in terms of consequent Covid-mentioned deaths.” In fact, infections may have peaked already, says Hunter. “My best guess is that they peaked around 21 March, but given that the ONS survey is a prevalence survey and always published a week behind we should not expect to see falling ONS estimates until next week at the earliest and probably not until the following Friday,” he added. However, the picture is likely to be confusing, added Kao. “As testing goes down and surveillance is slowed or stopped, it will become very difficult to tell for sure.” Are we likely to get a Covid-free summer? No, says virologist Julian Tang, of Leicester University. “Covid-19 will persist through summer and into autumn – it has not become fully seasonal yet, unlike flu, which does disappear almost completely throughout spring and summer.” The seasonal behaviour of flu also contrasts with those common colds that are caused by coronaviruses and which persist all year round – albeit at relatively low levels – but with peaks in autumn and winter, he added. This point was backed by Hunter. “Even in the absence of a new variant, I suspect we will continue to see infections at a rate of a few tens of thousands a day, but most won’t be diagnosed and recorded. “We are only diagnosing about one in seven to one in eight new infections now and this may drop. However the rate of hospitalisations per infection is lower than at any time and does seem to be continuing to fall, so hopefully we won’t see many Covid-19 hospitalisations during summer.” Kao also warned that infection numbers were also likely to remain high. “We have to remember that for the bulk of people vaccinated last autumn, there will be a substantial drop in immune protection unless all adults are offered boosters. This combination means that it is likely that there will remain considerable Omicron infection circulating, though we still expect the overall level to drop compared to now.” What direction should vaccine development take to protect us against future rises in cases and new variants? A range of improvements in vaccines was highlighted by English, who pinpointed several key areas where efforts should be directed. “Current vaccines are very effective at preventing serious illness but if we are to prevent transmission, we need vaccines which are more effective at preventing transmission. Ideally, we would also have vaccines which induce longer-lasting immunity,” he told the Observer. In addition, it would be helpful to develop new methods of vaccine administration such as nasal sprays and vaccines that have been updated to match circulating variants as well as Covid-19 vaccines which can be given in combination with flu vaccines. “We may well require an annual vaccination against Covid-19 due to waning immunity – just as we do for influenza. It would make a lot of sense to combine the two in a single annual jab,” added English.",News/World news,"Covid cases at an all-time high, free testing scrapped... so what will happen now?",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/02/covid-cases-at-an-all-time-high-free-testing-scrapped-so-what-will-happen-now
4/3/2022,"Today (Radio 4) | BBC SoundsThe P Word (Radio 4) | BBC SoundsChameleon: Wild Boys (Campside Media) | apple.com Having moved away from the Today programme over the past few years, I find myself a regular listener once more. This is due to the brilliant Lyse Doucet, the BBC’s chief international correspondent, who’s been based in Kyiv since the start of the Russian invasion. At 8.10am, instead of a heavyweight political interview, the programme has been turning to Doucet. Her descriptive, directly worded reports are devastating. On 18 March, she said, of Mariupol, that Russian forces were “choking the city of its life… Russia realised it couldn’t take a city of nearly half a million people with ground forces, so it took the people first, starving them into submission, it hopes… 90% of Mariupol is flattened… Look at the photos of Aleppo in northern Syria. This is Mariupol today.” Doucet’s distinctive voice (she’s Canadian, of Acadian, Irish and Mi’kmaq ancestry) adds to her authority. On Wednesday last week, Today made her a co-host with Mishal Hussein in the London studio. Apart from the occasional crash over each other’s words (co-presenting is tricky when you can’t see each other), this worked well. Somehow, though she didn’t move from Kyiv, Doucet covered almost the whole of Ukraine. She spoke to Jonah Fisher, a BBC journalist in the western city of Lviv (things were OK, though tenser since the Russians bombed local fuel depots); also to a Ukrainian MP, a man who used to be just a politician, but, since the end of February, has become an armed one. He had a gun and a knife on him. Doucet peeked into his car: “Oh my goodness, that is an AK47.” She talked to cafe-goers, a singer and a couple of cyclists, all Kyiv citizens. A passerby told her that she should be in a bunker. The cyclists, who used to ride for recreation, were on their bikes delivering medical supplies and uniforms to soldiers. Doucet spoke to a former Nato deputy supreme allied commander in Europe, she met the mayor of Chernihiv, a town she described as “cursed by geography” (it’s on the way from Russia to Kyiv). “All days are working days,” he said. His job involves trying to find things: fridges for corpses because the mortuaries are full, carpenters to make more coffins, places to bury the dead because the cemetery is inaccessible owing to bombing. If you were to read some newspapers, you might think that the war is going fairly well for Ukraine; there’s an upbeat emphasis that says that the Russian invasion is not going to plan, that its soldiers are deserting, their tanks mired, their weapons out of date. Doucet, veteran of Afghanistan and Syria, makes us understand that in places like Mariupol and Chernihiv, this war is continuing without mercy. Thank goodness for her, for Anna Chornous, the Ukrainian producer working with her, and for all the other journalists giving us the real stories. Also on Radio 4 on Wednesday, an interesting programme about “the P-word”. When I was young, some people called corner shops “P-shops” – P meaning the racial slur used to describe anyone of south Asian descent. Many people still use the word in the same way, unbelievably, as Rajan Datar explained in his documentary of the same name. Datar is Indian, but was called that horrible name throughout his youth. He spoke to several people, including his mother, about it, and hosted a discussion between Aki Nawaz from Fun-Da-Mental, who believes that the word should be eradicated, and a Pakistani teenager who thinks it can be reclaimed, in the way that LGBTQ+ people have taken back “queer” and black people have reclaimed the N- word. As Yorkshire cricket has shown, this discussion is still, sadly, relevant. People are always asking me which podcast they should try. What they mean is: are there any new bingeable true-crime series? Chameleon: Wild Boys is my current fave. It’s not quite true crime, but it is a true story – of two strange teenage boys who appeared in a small Canadian town in 2003, insisting that they had been brought up in a forest. It’s beautifully paced, with excellent cliffhangers and much care in the sound production. Presenter Sam Mullins is great and he, eventually, even talks to the boys themselves, now adults. (A quick warning: this show isn’t for anyone triggered by discussion of eating disorders.) I was gripped and surprised throughout Wild Boys, right up to the final episode. It really doesn’t go where you think it will.

4/3/2022,"Jürgen Klopp said Liverpool welcomed the intensity of their title race with Manchester City after recording a 10th consecutive Premier League win in a hard-fought contest against Watford. Klopp marked his 250th league game in charge of Liverpool with a 160th victory as Diogo Jota scored his 20th goal of the season and Fabinho sealed the points with a late penalty. The win took Liverpool briefly top of the table before City’s win at Burnley, having trailed the reigning champions by 14 points on 15 January, and Klopp admitted there can be no margin for error in his team’s attempt to reclaim the title. The Liverpool manager said: “You can’t give an inch. To keep in the title race we have to win our football games, otherwise it will be really tricky. The next Premier League game is a big one [against City next Sunday], we can’t hide from that, but before then we have an important Champions League game to prepare for at Benfica. “I really appreciate the situation we are in. I said to the boys yesterday that if someone had told us in the summer that in early April we would be in this situation – won one trophy, in three competitions, full squad available - we should all take it. “The only better situation would be to be 20 points ahead of City but that’s not possible. That’s why it is all fine like it is. I don’t think we are favourites in one of the competitions we are in but who cares, we will give it a try. “It’s not about managing the situation or the pressure. People see the situation like pressure – I’m not sure I can change that. We create a basis which we can use but no one knows because opponents have their own targets and go for it. People thought Watford would be an easy game but we saw what happened. We cannot see situations like that.” Klopp admitted Liverpool were far from their best against Roy Hodgson’s well-organised team and had to fight their way through what was a 10th successive league win at Anfield. “It is unlikely after the international break that it will be the best game of the season,” he added. “We had to work through this game. At 1-0 down nothing changed, they still had counterattacks and that makes it uncomfortable, but once we scored we kept it in control and that was important.” Hodgson was unhappy with VAR alerting referee Stuart Attwell to the foul by Juraj Kucka on Jota that led to Liverpool’s penalty. “That was the only sad moment for me today,” the Watford manager said. “Nobody saw it – the referee, Jürgen or me – not one Liverpool player complained, but the game is stopped and Liverpool are given the chance to win 2-0. It leaves an unpleasant taste in the mouth.”",Sport/Football,Jürgen Klopp relishes intensity of Liverpool’s title tussle with City,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/02/jurgen-klopp-relishes-intensity-of-liverpools-title-tussle-with-city
4/3/2022,"The Georgia senate passed a bill on Friday that would limit discussions of race in kindergarten through 12th grade classrooms. House Bill 1084, the “Protect Students First Act”, was approved by the Georgia senate. The measure requires local school boards and administrators to ban discrimination on the “basis of race” by limiting how race can be discussed in classrooms. Under the bill, discussion topics that would be banned include teaching that “one race is inherently superior to another race” or that the US is “fundamentally racist”, reported CNN. “We can teach US history, the good, the bad and the ugly, without dividing children along racial lines,” said the Georgia senate president pro tem, Butch Miller, of the bill that passed 32-21. “We must teach patriotism and that America is good, though not perfect, that America is good,” Miller added. The bill already passed the Georgia house, but will return to that chamber for final approval after small changes were made in the senate, reported the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC). If approved, the measure will go to the Republican governor, Brian Kemp, to be signed into law. Kemp has already signaled support for initiatives like House Bill 1084. During his state of the state address in January, Kemp said that he would support lawmakers trying to stop the “divisive ideology” of “critical race theory”. Despite support from Republican lawmakers, the bill has received sharp criticism, with students and teachers who are leading protests at the state capitol in opposition, reported AJC. “It’s time for us to be able to have these uncomfortable conversations candidly,” said Maurice Brewton, a US history teacher in Georgia, to AJC. “We don’t want to continue to push the conversation back and make the next generation have to deal with it,” added Brewton. Like Georgia, other state legislators have either passed or proposed initiatives censoring education in classrooms. In Mississippi, law makers passed a bill banning the teaching of “critical race theory” in elementary schools, high schools, and colleges throughout the state.",News/US news,Georgia senate passes bill limiting discussion of race in schools,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/02/georgia-race-teaching-schools-bill-governor
