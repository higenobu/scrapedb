3/30/2022,"Jeanine Pirro’s take on Will Smith’s assault of Chris Rock during the Oscars ceremony took a racist turn on Monday. (Watch the video below.) Asked for her perspective on “The Five,” the Fox News host replied: “What do I think? I think that the Oscars are not the hood.” Twitter users let her have it for reducing a confrontation between A-list Black entertainers to “the hood.” One called her a “disgusting racist.” Another cracked: “Will Smith is worth $350 million, and Jeanine Pirro has never been to either the hood or the Oscars.” Smith, who later in Sunday’s ceremony won Best Actor for “King Richard,” strode onstage and slapped Rock, a presenter, after a “G.I. Jane 2” joke about his wife Jada Pinkett Smith’s shaved head. Pinkett Smith has spoken openly about her alopecia, a disorder that causes hair loss. Pirro detoured to praise Pinkett Smith’s beauty as equal to that of Demi Moore, who shaved her head to star in the 1997 military movie “G.I. Jane.” Then she swerved back to Smith, condemning him for his willingness to “take it upon himself to disrupt the event ... to commit violence onstage.” Smith could have been hauled off in handcuffs ― “that was a crime, what he did” ― and should be banned from future ceremonies, she said. And Pirro saw a message for conservatives in Smith returning to his seat after the assault as the awards ceremony continued. “Hollywood proves that they don’t have to follow the rules,” she said. “If you’re on the right and you say something they don’t like, then they can respond with violence.” Watch Pirro’s commentary after remarks by Piers Morgan at the 0:57 mark: Here are other tweets about Pirro’s comments: H/T Media Matters This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

3/30/2022,"New documents reveal what may have gone wrong when a 14-year-old fell from an Orlando thrill ride and died last week. Tyre Sampson’s family released red heart balloons on Monday night at the memorial that has formed at ICON Park. An accident report from the state showed the ride did not malfunction. Documents make it clear that Sampson should not have been allowed to ride the Orlando FreeFall. The report said the 14-year-old was over the weight and size limit for the ride.

According to the ride manual, the maximum weight of a rider should be 286 pounds. Sampson’s father said he was about 60 pounds heavier than that. Family said the teen was turned away from other rides.

You told me he couldn’t get on the SlingShot. So why did you allow him to get on this?” In another section of the manual, it said large people should fit into the seat and the harness should fit properly, otherwise they should not ride. ICON Park is now calling for the owner of FreeFall to suspend operation of the ride and the Orlando SlingShot effective immediately, until the authorities certify the attractions are safe.

3/30/2022,"Amid mounting evidence of Russian war crimes in Ukraine, a young Ukrainian mother is speaking out about what may be the first rape case connected to the 2022 invasion to go before The Hague: She says she was repeatedly raped by Russian soldiers while her 4-year-old son sat just a few feet away. In an interview with The Times of London published Tuesday, the woman, identified only by the pseudonym Natalya, says she still has not been able to bring herself to tell her son that his father was murdered by the Russian soldiers. “We cannot bury him, we can’t get to the village, because the village is still occupied,” the 33-year-old mother said of the family’s home in Brovary, a suburb of Kyiv. It was there that she says Russian soldiers arrived on the morning of March 9 and, despite a white sheet hanging from the family’s home to indicate there were no military targets. They killed the family’s dog before gunning down Natalya’s husband a few hours later. “I heard a single shot, the sounds of the gate opening and then the sound of footsteps in the house,” she was quoted telling the Times. “I cried out, ‘Where is my husband?’ then I looked outside and I saw him on the ground by the gate. This younger guy pulled gun to my head and said: ‘I shot your husband because he’s a Nazi.’” After that, she said, things became only more harrowing. While her son sat sheltering in a dark boiler room at the home, the soldiers set their sights on her. “[One of the Russian soldiers] said ‘You’d better shut up or I’ll get your child and show him his mother’s brains spread around the house,’” she said. “He told me to take my clothes off. Then they both raped me one after the other. They didn’t care that my son was in the boiler room crying. They told me to go shut him up and come back. All the time they held the gun by my head and taunted me, saying ‘How do you think she sucks it? Shall we kill her or keep her alive?’” They brutalized her again less than a half hour later, she said, but she and her son managed to flee when both the soldiers got “so drunk” they passed out. “While I was opening the gate, my son was standing next to his father’s body but it was dark and he did not understand it was his father. He said ‘Will we get shot the same as this man here?’” she said. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, announced last week that Ukrainian authorities had identified one of Natalya’s rapists, and that a warrant was out for his arrest. “We will find every villain and make him answer to the fullest extent of the law,” Venediktova wrote on Facebook. Natalya said the Russian commander who raped her had introduced himself to her by name, and she later managed to track him down on social media. There are unconfirmed rumors that he was ultimately killed by Ukrainian forces, but, she said, “I still do not know for sure if it is true.” While Natalya’s story stands out because she was able to identify one of her attackers, reports of rape by Russian marauders have multiplied since the Kremlin launched its all-out war against Ukraine on Feb. 24. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said he intends to bring such cases before the International Criminal Court. And while evidence of such war-time rapes is typically difficult to collect, Ukrainian authorities say Russian troops have openly talked about systemic rape in intercepted phone calls. Ukraine’s Security Service released audio this past weekend of a man it identifies as a Russian soldier telling a female acquaintance about troops killing civilians and preying on women in an occupied village. “The guys in the neighboring village raped a grown woman and a 16-year-old girl,” he can be heard saying. Authorities did not reveal where the Russian soldier captured in the recording was based. In another audio clip shared earlier this month by Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, a man identified as a Russian soldier laughingly tells a friend about one of his comrades boasting about executing civilians and committing rapes. “‘And they will give me a medal for that,’” he recalled the soldier joking.
