1/11/2022,"Another day, another initiative to stop hospitals becoming overwhelmed by a combination of the Omicron surge and normal winter pressures. NHS England has struck a deal with private healthcare providers whereby their hospitals will be ready to start treating NHS patients who cannot get the Covid or non-Covid care they need because their local NHS hospital is too under the severe pressure. This follows the recent news that “mini-Nightingale” field hospitals are being built in the grounds of eight hospitals, that gyms and education centres in hospitals could be turned into overflow wards and that thousands of Covid patients could be treated at home in “virtual wards”. Any or all of this could happen if the increase in Covid hospitalisations leads to a hospital trust or even entire region of the NHS deciding it needs “surge capacity”.  Announcing the latest tie-up with the private sector on Monday, NHS England’s chief operating officer, Sir David Sloman, who is also the service’s Covid incident director, said: “This deal … means as many people as possible can continue to get the care they need. “It also places independent health providers on standby to provide further help should hospitals face unsustainable levels of hospitalisations or staff absences. Just like the Nightingale hubs being created across the country, we hope never to need their support. But it will be there if needed.” Sloman said the the new arrangement was “struck under direction from the secretary of state”. It is easy to see why Sajid Javid would look to private hospitals to ease the NHS’s burden. First, the waiting list for non-urgent hospital care in England is already at a record 5.83m and may break through the 6m barrier when the latest monthly performance figures come out on Thursday. Downing Street is open about the fact that getting that big number down is a key priority. Second, the number of hospitals that have been forced to cancel elective surgery in the face of intense pressure will increase the headline total when the same statistics come out next month. Third, however one feels about privatisation of NHS care, it is unarguable that people who needed urgent surgery during the pandemic, for a range of serious conditions but especially for cancer, have been able to undergo a procedure in a private hospital that they would otherwise have had to wait an indeterminate length of time to receive on the NHS, because the pandemic disrupted so many non-Covid services, especially in the first wave. The health impact of that is still emerging. Will any part of the NHS need to in effect commandeer their local private hospital(s)? The deal is “another NHS insurance policy”, one health service boss says. The fact that at least 24 trusts in England have had to declare a major alert since New Year’s Day, because they could not cope with the level of demand they were facing, especially with so many staff off sick because of Omicron, suggests the arrangement may have to be triggered, especially with Covid admissions rising in many regions – up 7% in 24 hours on Monday in both the north-west and south-west, for example. But David Rowland, the director of the Centre for Health and the Public Interest thinktank, cautions that private hospitals’ reliance on NHS consultants means the plan “really doesn’t stack up as a way of adding capacity to the NHS”. He also asks whether private hospitals will be paid just the NHS “tariff” rate for any treatment they do provide – the fee they receive when performing a hip or knee replacement on an NHS patient – or whether the health service’s almost desperate need for extra capacity means they will receive a markup as part of the deal. NHS England said only that details about the “pricing and funding of the arrangements” would follow in the next few days. The deal confirms that the sheer scale of the healthcare backlog means the NHS will be looking to private hospitals to undertake as many operations as they can for the foreseeable future. NHS England was budgeting to spend £10bn on them for that purpose over the next four years even before Javid ordered this tie-up. A report by the Commons health select committee last week said the private sector would play a key role in the NHS’s chances of tackling the backlog and that reality was central to NHS England’s finished but still-unpublished “elective recovery plan”. The many people offended by NHS billions being handed to private hospital groups will baulk at what is likely to be a long-term marriage of convenience. But a decade of successive governments underfunding, and ignoring or worsening its staff shortages has left the NHS no choice.",News/Politics,NHS England left with no choice but go private during Omicron surge,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/10/nhs-england-left-with-no-choice-but-turn-to-private-hospitals
1/11/2022,"On the day that one of the prime minister’s most senior aides cheerily emailed more than 100 staff to suggest drinks in the Downing Street garden, a cabinet minister was telling the public they could meet only one person outside their household in an outdoor public place, 2 metres apart. The starkly different advice from Oliver Dowden at the No 10 press conference was less than an hour before the email from Martin Reynolds was sent on 20 May 2020. And that disparity would seem to encapsulate better than perhaps any other alleged No 10 party – and there were many – the “one rule for them” approach that has been so damaging for Boris Johnson.  It puts paid to the different explanations No 10 has offered for each new scandal, and it leaves the prime minister most personally exposed. After the news of the 2020 Christmas party story broke six weeks ago, Johnson himself said he had not attended and that he had been assured by aides the party did not take place. Many No 10 insiders believed that was to give himself scope to sack the senior aides who briefed him before his PMQs appearance before Christmas, should the heat become too great for him. When he was revealed to have attended a winter leaving do and a festive Zoom quiz, he argued the approaches were within the rules. That was the response also taken to the Guardian’s picture of Johnson in the Downing Street garden on 15 May 2020, relaxing with cheese and wine in the company of his wife, Carrie, and their newborn son, as well as Dominic Cummings and Reynolds, his principal private secretary. Despite the aides standing around with glasses, No 10 insisted it was work-related, backed up by Cummings this week – not one to normally cut the PM any slack. And however unbelievable that explanation seemed when compared with the atmosphere in the Guardian picture, the newly revealed Reynolds invitation makes it ever clearer: that explanation will not wash this time. Two defences no longer apply. Firstly, Johnson is said by multiple sources to have been in attendance at the 20 May drinks, meaning there is no distance between him and the lockdown-breaking, and no aides can be blamed for misinformation. Secondly, this gathering cannot be justified as an important work meeting. Reynolds’ jaunty tone makes that clear: “After what has been an incredibly busy period it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening.” Socially distanced they may have been, but the sheer number involved is a clear breach of pandemic rules in place at the time. The tone will be particularly galling as Matt Hancock, the then health secretary, had warned in one of his addresses: “This weekend, with the good weather and the new rules … don’t take risks.” No 10 has a holding position it can take to avoid commenting before the inquiry by senior civil servant Sue Gray concludes. Reynolds has been widely rumoured to be on the way out, heading back to the diplomatic service having previously been ambassador to Libya for six months before Johnson asked him to return as his principal private secretary. One Whitehall source said he was hoping to return to the Middle East. Tory MPs had hoped after new year that the heat would die down on the parties scandal, with the public having been allowed to enjoy a more normal Christmas with loved ones. But the new revelations could prove even more damaging, leaving the prime minister with no shield for his own rule-breaking.",News/Politics,Leaked email about drinks event at No 10 explodes Johnson’s defences,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/10/leaked-email-about-drinks-event-at-no-10-explodes-johnsons-defences
1/11/2022,"Bumper shareholder payouts, soaring profits, booming asset valuations: the oil and gas industry has bounced back from the depths of the pandemic with a vengeance. After a difficult 2020, when plunging demand led in some cases to negative prices, crude recovered in 2021 and wholesale gas prices have soared in Europe and the UK. Gas has risen as much as tenfold to new all-time highs, due to factors including low storage capacity, strong Chinese demand and low wind generation during the summer.  BP boss Bernard Looney said recently illustrated this bonanza when he said the oil and gas giant has become a “cash machine”. North Sea oil and gas companies are expected to report near-record cashflows of almost $20bn (£14.9bn) for the current financial year, according to industry experts at Wood MacKenzie. The revival of the industry’s fortunes has spurred calls for a windfall tax on North Sea producers, with the proceeds used to subsidise energy bills for households facing a cost-of-living crisis. The Liberal Democrats first made the call last week, and Labour also took up the call at the weekend. Rachel Reeves, shadow chancellor of the exchequer, said: “There is a global gas price crisis, but 10 years of the Conservatives’ failed energy policy, and dither and delay, has created a price crisis that’s being felt by everyone. We want to stop bills going up.” The Conservative former energy minister Chris Skidmore has also publicly backed the idea, which has been rejected by the government. Shell, the world’s largest producer and trader of liquefied natural gas (LNG), said last week that profits would be higher than expected thanks to high prices. Unlike gas that arrives via pipelines from fields in the North Sea, LNG is shipped across oceans to the highest bidder, meaning companies like Shell benefit from surging global prices. Shell was already planning to hand investors a $7bn bonus by offering to buy shares back from them but has now said this will happen “at pace”. The largest North Sea explorer isn’t BP or Shell though, it’s Harbour Energy, created via the merger of Premier Oil and Chrysaor earlier this year. In a recent update, Harbour said it expected “materially higher free cash flow at current commodity prices” and announced a $200m-a-year (£147m) dividend for investors. Many firms that drill for oil and gas in the North Sea are private companies, not listed on the stock market, meaning they do not have to publish accounts as promptly as companies such as BP, Shell or Harbour. But some have provided insight into how high gas prices are working in their favour. Rising oil prices have been good news for chemicals group Ineos, which is owned by Monaco-based British multi-billionaire Sir Jim Racliffe and has drilling licences in fields including Breagh and the West of Shetlands area. Revenues increased by 87%, or €2.4bn, to €5.1bn in the three month period ended 30 September 2021. This was “driven primarily by higher prices and increased volumes,” the company said. “The increase in selling prices followed the increase in crude oil prices, which increased to an average of $73 [per barrel] as compared to $43 in the same period in 2020.” In a recent update on trading, Ithaca, owned by Israeli group Delek, said rising prices meant gas revenue per barrel from its North Sea assets, which include the Alba and Alder gas fields, nearly doubled in the third quarter, from $49 last year to $97. As it boosted production to meet demand and cash in on strong prices, revenues from gas more than tripled from $59m to $180m over the three-month period. The industry has warned against a windfall tax, and points out that its own improved fortunes mean a multi-billion pound tax uplift. “[The Treasury] will get an additional £3.5bn taxes in the two years from last April – making a total of more than £5 billion,” said Oil & Gas UK spokesperson Jenny Stanning. “We already pay up to 40% corporation tax – roughly double any other sector.” Graham Kellas, senior vice president of global fiscal research at Wood Mackenzie, said a windfall tax might be counterproductive. “Higher taxes generally dampen investment and the upstream industry is currently under pressure to reduce activity, so this could be exacerbated,” he said. “Some companies may not pay any more tax even if the rate increases,” he added. “If they are investing in new projects, or involved in significant decommissioning operations, the deduction of these costs could absorb most of their revenue. For others, it will reduce their profit margin. “This may not have an immediate impact on activity but will reduce enthusiasm for future investment. Reduced investment will accelerate the decline in North Sea production and this will need to be replaced by imports, unless demand for oil products decreases at a similar rate.” Malcolm Graham-Wood, founding partner of Hydrocarbon Capital, said: “Those suggesting a windfall tax have very short memories, not only did chancellor Osborne have to rescind a windfall owing to a massive drop in activity in the North Sea but that it was only two years ago that oil was trading at a negative number as demand was so weak. “The bottom line is that it has been proved to be counterproductive to windfall tax the oil companies operating in the North Sea.” Green campaigners have also argued strongly that the answer to high energy prices is to generate more green power, and criticised ministers for their lack of action. Tessa Khan, director of Uplift, which campaigns for a fossil-free UK, told the Guardian: “This government has abdicated responsibility for securing affordable energy to profit-driven oil and gas companies, with disastrous results for households. As long the government fails to plan for and support renewable energy at the scale we need, we’ll continue to be reliant on expensive gas imports in this country. Opening up new oil and gas fields in the UK won’t change energy bills and will only lock us into long-term dependency on fossil fuels.” She added: “If you want to know why the government has ceded control to the industry, just look to the the generous oil and gas company donations the Conservative party receives, or the dozens of Lords and MPs that are employed by or have shares in the industry. But really it’s a lack of vision, planning and investment in the UK’s massive renewables potential.”",News/Business,Calls for windfall tax as North Sea oil and gas profits soar,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/10/north-sea-oil-gas-companies-cashflows-windfall-tax
1/11/2022,"Good morning. Novak Djokovic’s visa cancellation saga continues despite his return to centre court ahead of the Australian Open next week. But he’s not the only tennis star in doubt for the grand slam – Nick Kyrgios has tested positive for Covid. Tensions between Russia and Ukraine persist, but security talks between the Kremlin and the US are under way this week. Novak Djokovic has thanked Judge Anthony Kelly for overturning his visa cancellation, but still faces potential deportations from Australia’s immigration minister, Alex Hawke. Hawke confirmed that he is considering the use of discretionary powers to deport Djokovic, which comes with a hefty three-year ban from re-entering Australia. His decision is expected this week. Meanwhile Djokovic’s family have criticised the Australian government and his mother said he was “subjected to torture and harassment” while in detention. But the family abruptly ended a press conference when questioned about why Djokovic, who is not vaccinated, was photographed in public last month without a mask after testing positive for Covid.  The federal government was warned in November that widespread rapid antigen testing was needed to protect vulnerable people in aged care. There are currently Covid outbreaks in almost 500 aged care homes nationally, with 1,400 residents and 2,000 staff infected. Paul Sadler, chief executive of the peak body Aged & Community Services Australia, said that he believed the numbers were under-reported, and that providers were “running real risks” without the assistance of a testing regime. He said if they had rapid antigen tests available it would “make a significant impact in reducing the spread within the aged care homes and keeping people safe.” US and Russian diplomats have recently emerged from a day of negotiations in Geneva over the fate of Ukraine, describing the talks as “useful” and “very professional”, but stressing they had not made progress towards resolving fundamental disagreements. The two sides largely spent the day’s talks presenting their points of view on the situation in Ukraine, currently hemmed in by 100,000 Russian troops, and on European security in general, and deferred further debate to a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday between Russia and all Nato members. Leading Australian academics have criticised the federal government for the “political and shortsighted” decision to reject the Australian Research Council’s recommendations to fund six projects. An open letter and petition are calling on acting education minister, Stuart Robert, to reverse the decision. Labor has preselected Catherine Renshaw, a human rights lawyer, to run against Liberal moderate Trent Zimmerman in North Sydney. The seat is currently held by Zimmerman by a margin of 9.3%, making it one of the Liberals’ safest. Australia food producers are pleading for more government help to cope with Covid disruptions as farm workers are hit by the virus. But rule changes this week will offer some relief with asymptomatic and Covid-negative staff cleared to return to work in Victoria. The EU’s police agency, Europol, will be forced to delete a vast store of personal data that it has been found to have amassed unlawfully by the bloc’s data protection watchdog. One of Boris Johnson’s top officials invited staff to “socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden” during May of the first lockdown, a leaked email shows. The last seven years were the world’s hottest on record, with the first analysis of global temperature in 2021 showing it was 1.2C above pre-industrial levels. Fears are growing among experts about the rise of rightwing extremism in the US military and the potential threat it could pose to American democracy. Our brains really like order, but often our pantries and fridges are a chaos of old herbs and expired condiments. Decluttering can reduce stress, and it need only be done one shelf at a time. “Just do one shelf in the fridge, then throw things out, clean it, put things back,” says Libby Sander, assistant professor of organisational behaviour at Bond Business School. “And then once you have done the whole fridge, or the whole pantry, then you can say, OK, well, maybe I’ll reorganise what shelf everything goes on now that I’ve got more room.” “The Drones’ worst show ever was in York in England on 24 April 2007,” says founding member Gareth Liddiard. “All our equipment broke down. The gig ended with just me, playing through my amp which had somehow survived. I wrapped it up, went off and we went out the back to where the van was, and every window in the van had been smashed. Everything had been stolen. So we were like, for fuck’s sake! How much worse can it get?!” Hate doing the laundry? A few changes in what you wear, when you wear it and what you do once you’ve worn something can help reduce your time spent toiling over dirty clothes. “Thinking in terms of prevention is a good strategy,” says Kate Fletcher, professor at the Centre for Sustainable Fashion. She advises always wearing an apron while cooking; tucking trouser legs into socks to keep hems free from mud when you’re out walking; and wearing a singlet or undershirt beneath shirts and blouses so you only need to wash the bottom layer, not the outer garment. One of our favourite stories of 2021 looks at the career of Australian wheelchair racer Madison de Rozario, which started when she competed at the Beijing Paralympics at the age of 14. Now, the 27-year-old has cemented her place in the history books – breaking multiple records and winning three medals, including two gold, at the Tokyo Paralympics. De Rozario speaks to reporter Kieran Pender about her sometimes bumpy rise to wheelchair-racing fame and the power of the Paralympics as a vehicle for change.

1/11/2022,"Fox News has promoted the controversial host Jesse Watters to a nightly primetime show, in an apparent cementing of the conservative network’s shift even further right.  Watters faced calls to resign in December after he suggested people should “ambush” Anthony Fauci and “go in for the kill shot” by presenting the infectious diseases expert with conspiracy theories. Instead, he will host his own show at 7pm on weeknights, Fox News said on Monday. Jesse Watters Primetime permanently replaces what was once a relatively “straight” news show hosted by Martha MacCullum. As CNN reported, Fox News dropped MacCullum from 7pm after the 2020 election, replacing her with a slate of rotating rightwing personalities. Fox News appeared delighted with the Watters news, with its chief executive, Suzanne Scott, praising his “versatility and hosting acumen” and “deep connection to the audience”. But Watters has a history of controversial statements and poor-taste programming. He rose to prominence after he visited Chinatown in New York City for a segment on Bill O’Reilly’s show in 2016. The video, much of which was set to the song Kung Fu Fighting by Carl Douglas, featured Watters asking locals if he should bow to them before he visited a martial arts studio and played with a set of nunchuks. The video was interspersed with clips of Mr Miyagi, a fictional Japanese character in the movie The Karate Kid. “The vile, racist behavior of Fox’s Jesse Watters in Chinatown has no place in our city,” the then New York mayor, Bill de Blasio, said. Watters addressed the controversy on Twitter, writing: “My man-on-the-street interviews are meant to be taken as tongue-in-cheek and I regret if anyone found offense.” His ascent to primetime comes after the departure of Fox News’ most high-profile “straight news” journalist. Chris Wallace, who had been at Fox News for 18 years, frequently served as a counterpoint to the rightwing opinion that fills night-time schedules but finally left for CNN. NPR reported that Wallace had expressed concerns to management over a Tucker Carlson documentary, Patriot Purge, which attempted to rewrite the events of 6 January 2021 and aired on Fox Nation, Fox News’ streaming-only channel. Watters’ elevation was announced less than a month after Fauci called for him to be “fired on the spot”. Watters told an audience they should approach Fauci in public and present the 81-year-old a pre-prepared conspiracy theory. This, Watters said, would be “the kill shot, with an ambush. Deadly: ’cause he doesn’t see it coming”. Fauci has been subjected to death threats during the coronavirus pandemic. Watters said: “This is when you say: ‘Dr Fauci, you funded risky research at a sloppy Chinese lab, the same lab that sprung this pandemic on the world. You know why people don’t trust you, don’t you?’ “Boom, he is dead! He is dead! He’s done!” In a statement on Monday, Fox News said: “Based on watching the full clip and reading the entire transcript, it’s more than clear that Jesse Watters was using a metaphor for asking hard-hitting questions to Dr Fauci about gain-of-function research and his words have been twisted completely out of context.” Watters also faced backlash after seeming to make sexually loaded comments about Ivanka Trump, an accusation he denied. Fox News remains the most popular US cable news channel by far, with an average of 1.3 million viewers and 2.4 million in the 8-11pm slot, when Sean Hannity, Carlson and Laura Ingraham appear. Over the past two decades, the 7pm hour has largely been reserved for news or analysis, rather than the commentary Watters will provide. Carlson did have a brief spell in the time slot. Fox News, media watchers say, has spent the year since Donald Trump’s defeat further engaging in themes attractive to the right, including hosts and guests advancing vaccine skepticism. Other hosts have told viewers they should consider getting a Covid-19 vaccine. Carlson, the most-watched host, has championed Kyle Rittenhouse, who was acquitted in November after killing two people at a protest. The network has been sued by two election technology companies, over election conspiracy theories.",News/Media,Fox News signals further drift to the right with Jesse Watters’ new show,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/10/fox-news-signals-further-drift-right-jesse-watters-new-show
1/11/2022,"To many, May 2020 may feel like a lifetime ago, so much has happened in the last 20 months of the Covid-19 pandemic. On 20 May 2020, when the prime minister’s private secretary was inviting colleagues to bring their own booze for socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden to “make the most of this lovely weather”, the rest of the country was in a very different position.  There was no mixing indoors, non-essential shops were shut, and pubs and other hospitality businesses remained closed. Such was the strangeness of the times, that people were ecstatically celebrating the reopening of McDonald’s drive-throughs as more than 30 branches trialled a gradual reopening of the fast-food chain. The prime minister had only recently announced a slight relaxing to the lockdown rules – from 13 May 2020, two people from separate households were permitted to meet outside in a public place, such as a park, provided they stayed 2 metres apart. Police forces were actively reminding the public to adhere to the rule, a challenge given 20 May 2020 was the hottest day of the year so far. Have you been enjoying the hottest day of the year so far? 🌞It is important that we all continue to #StayAlertYou can relax, have a picnic, exercise or play sport, as long as you are:➡️ On your own➡️ With people you live with➡️ Just you and one other person pic.twitter.com/LAVe6DScQ5 Just two days later, on 22 May 2020, the Guardian published its first exclusive revealing police had spoken to the prime minister’s former adviser, Dominic Cummings, about breaching the government’s lockdown rules after he was seen in Durham, 264 miles from his London home, despite having had Covid-19 symptoms. The story prompted an outcry. Guidance allowing the “rule of six” outdoors was not brought in until June 2020 and large gatherings remained banned. All of this was reinforced by the then culture secretary, now Conservative party chair, Oliver Dowden, in the daily Downing Street press conference on 20 May. He said: “You can meet one person outside your household in an outdoor, public place provided that you stay 2 metres apart.” But alone, or with your household, “you can now spend time outdoors and exercise as often as you like”. He reminded viewers of the “step one” changes to the rules, which said those who could not work from home should now speak to their employer about going back to work. This was all against a backdrop of the ever-rising statistics many have come to know too well. On 20 May 2020, there were 9,953 people in hospital with coronavirus. A further 363 deaths were announced, bringing the total at that point to 35,704. Dowden announced the launch of the Covid Alert Level System, with its five levels each relating to the level of threat posed by the virus. At the time, the country was preparing to move to level 3 from 4. Twenty months later, we’re back in level 4 after the emergence of the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the virus. Dowden pushed the government’s latest slogan: “stay alert, control the virus, save lives”. He elaborated on how the public might “stay alert” by working from home if possible, limiting contact with other people, keeping 2 metres apart where possible, washing hands regularly and wearing a face covering in enclosed spaces. Elsewhere, the prime minister was enraging Britain’s foreign healthcare workforce with his refusal to exempt them from an NHS visa surcharge. The next day, in the first major U-turn of his premiership, he announced this would no longer apply, capitulating to mounting anger from campaigners and opposition from members of his own party.",News/World news,20 May 2020: what was UK doing while No 10 aide organised a party?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/10/20-may-2020-what-was-uk-doing-while-no-10-aide-organised-a-party
1/11/2022,"When the Woodstock Music and Art Fair was held in upstate New York in August 1969, it was billed as “Three days of peace, love and music”, though nobody could have predicted that it would attract half a million people and become an enduring monument to the 1960s counterculture. Starring the Who, Santana, Jimi Hendrix, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Janis Joplin and many more, Woodstock gave birth to the “Woodstock Nation”, an escapist alternative to the assassinations, racial conflict and Vietnam war casting shadows over the US. One of the key organisers of the festival was Michael Lang, who has died aged 77 of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.  “Woodstock came at a really dark moment in America,” said Lang in a 2009 Rolling Stone interview. “An unpopular war, a government that was unresponsive, lots of human rights issues – things were starting to edge toward violence for people to make their points. And along came Woodstock, which was this moment of hope.” Not everyone agreed – the music writer David Dalton decried Woodstock as “an exercise in consummate narcissism” and “a hippy Disneyland” – but the festival’s significance as a benchmark of its era and a template for festivals to come lives on. Lang had been promoting concerts in Florida and in 1968 had produced the Miami pop festival, featuring Hendrix and Frank Zappa, before he relocated to Woodstock in early 1969. Woodstock had its own community of musicians that included Van Morrison and Richie Havens, and Lang frequently attended the low-key performances by the local artists known as “Saturday soundouts”. Lang became manager of a band called Train, and approached the Capitol Records executive Artie Kornfeld to try to get them a deal. Kornfeld did not bite, but the pair began throwing ideas around, including a proposal to build a recording studio in the town of Woodstock. They approached the entrepreneurs John Roberts and Joel Rosenman – who had advertised themselves in the Wall Street Journal as “Young Men with Unlimited Capital Looking for Interesting and Legitimate Business Ideas” – to participate in the project, but Roberts and Rosenman were more interested in Lang and Kornfeld’s other idea of a Woodstock music festival, whose profits would fund the studio. The foursome created Woodstock Ventures Inc, which would produce the event. However, the Woodstock authorities would not allow it in their town, and the burghers of nearby Wallkill were also loath to be swamped by the hippytide. A deal was then struck to rent Max Yasgur’s 600-acre dairy farm near Bethel for $75,000. Nobody was prepared for the unprecedented invasion of music fans and the local police’s failure to make any arrangements for traffic management created a logjam of abandoned vehicles blocking local highways for miles. Lang, who commissioned the Woodstock logo of a peace dove sitting on the neck of a guitar, said: “Our vision was to create a very positive, a very sort of comforting environment for the audience, not to present confrontation in any way.” He had devised a “Please Force” of unarmed officers to control security, but as the crowds expanded uncontrollably the army and the national guard had to fly in emergency water, food and medical supplies by helicopter. Lang and his partners had anticipated an attendance of about 200,000, a manageable number that would have guaranteed them a profit, but as attendees trampled over fences and swarmed on to the site, they abandoned the attempt to sell tickets. The loss of ticket revenue left Lang and his fellow organisers millions of dollars out of pocket, but they were subsequently rescued when Michael Wadleigh’s film of the festival (in which Lang appeared prominently) became a lucrative smash hit the following year, grossing $50m in the US. The live albums from the festival also sold strongly. The event was memorialised in the song Woodstock by Joni Mitchell (who did not perform there), and in May 1970 it reached number 11 on the US chart in a storming rendition by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young (who did). Lang was born into a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York. His father ran a construction and heating installation company, for which his mother was the bookkeeper. Michael attended New York University to study business and psychology, but dropped out in 1967 and moved to Coconut Grove in Miami, where he opened a “headshop” selling drug paraphernalia. After Woodstock, he became the manager of Joe Cocker, one of the festival’s featured artists, and their partnership lasted more than 20 years. He was also recruited at short notice to assist with relocating the Rolling Stones’ December 1969 free concert in California from Sears Point Raceway to the Altamont Speedway. The event is now regarded as the tragic anti-Woodstock because of the killing of the audience member Meredith Hunter during the Stones’ performance. Lang considered it “a missed opportunity and the result of a lack of planning … what could have been a great day of music degenerated into a horror show”. During the 70s Lang ran his own Just Sunshine Records label, releasing discs by artists including Karen Dalton, Mississippi Fred McDowell and Betty Davis (the former wife of Miles Davis), and in the 80s managed Rickie Lee Jones. However, he remained dedicated to sustaining the legacy of Woodstock, devoting much energy to staging anniversary editions and at one point proposing an annual Woodstock festival at different sites around the world. For its 25th anniversary, Lang co-produced Woodstock ’94 in Saugerties, New York, some 70 miles from the 1969 site. Artists included veterans of the original lineup, such as Crosby, Stills and Nash and Country Joe McDonald, alongside newer names including Nine Inch Nails and Green Day. As a venue for Woodstock ’99, Lang found a former air force base in Rome, New York, to which 400,000 fans flocked in July that year. However, the event was scarred by violence, looting, sexual assaults and over-priced food, while extreme temperatures and insufficient free water caused widespread distress. Disgusted punters referred to the event as “Greedstock”. In 2009 his memoir The Road to Woodstock (co-written with Holly George-Warren) was published, and also that year Lang was portrayed by Jonathan Groff in Ang Lee’s film Taking Woodstock. In 2019 he appeared in the two documentaries Woodstock: 3 Days That Changed Everything and Woodstock: Three Days That Defined a Generation. Lang battled hard to mount a 50th anniversary Woodstock festival in 2019, with the Watkins Glen race track in upstate New York the first proposed venue and funding to be supplied by the multinational media company Dentsu Aegis Network (now Dentsu International). However, Woodstock 50 was plagued by delays and cancellations (and was relocated to Maryland), with grandiose plans to present such icons as Bruce Springsteen, Paul McCartney and a reunited Led Zeppelin all turning to dust. The project collapsed in lawsuits and acrimony, but Lang was unbowed. “What we did in 1969 was in 1969 and that’s what has endured and will continue to endure. We’re not going away,” he told Rolling Stone. His first marriage, to Ann, ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife, Tamara, their daughters, LariAnn, Shala and Molly, and sons, Laszlo and Harry.

1/11/2022,"Boris Johnson has ordered officials to examine plans to cut Covid isolation to five days in England as scientists urged caution over the lack of evidence to support a change. The prime minister came out on Monday in favour of easing quarantine rules if backed by scientific advice. It is understood that the health secretary, Sajid Javid, is also open to the move if clinicians recommend it.  The Cabinet Office has been charged with leading the isolation review with input from public health officials at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and Department of Health and Social Care. Two sources told the Guardian there may be a Covid-O meeting as soon as Thursday to examine any proposed changes. One of the options under consideration is for health and social care workers to have stricter conditions on release from isolation than the general population, it is understood. This would be designed to avoid Covid spreading to vulnerable people in hospitals or care homes and could involve keeping isolation periods at seven to 10 days for that group, requiring more testing or extra PPE. Political pressure has been building for a reduction in isolation after the US cut its quarantine period to five days, although the UK’s system is different in that it requires isolation from the point of symptoms rather than testing positive. Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, and Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, emerged as the first cabinet ministers to back a change if recommended by scientists, with others including Johnson and Javid following suit on Monday. Keir Starmer also said he would back a reduction in the time period if the evidence supported it. It is less than three weeks since isolation was cut from 10 days to seven in England if a person tests negative by lateral flow on days six and seven. It is likely that any move to shorten isolation periods again to five days would have caveats about testing negative and applying to those without symptoms. However, scientists still urged caution over the proposed move. Prof Peter Openshaw, a member of the government’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said while it was “reasonable” to look at reducing the isolation period to five days he had not seen evidence to back such a change. Convincing data could come from experiments that looked at how well LFTs distinguished between people who were still shedding infectious virus and those who were not, even if they still tested positive on PCR tests, he said. Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and a member of the Independent Sage group, said he was willing to be convinced that it was safe to shorten the isolation period but evidence to support the move seemed “elusive”. “The limited available evidence, for example [a] small Japanese study, provides little reassurance, suggesting that a substantial proportion of people infected with Omicron are still infectious at five days,” he said. Openshaw said the study was too small to say that asymptomatic people were not infectious beyond five days. If the isolation time were reduced, McKee said the government was right to consider extra precautions for health and social care workers. The UKHSA estimates that 10-30% of people who self-isolate following a positive Covid test are still infectious on day six, dropping to about 5% after day 10. Their modelling suggests a similar risk of being infectious - about 5% - if people end isolation after two negative tests on days six and seven. The work underpins the existing guidance on Covid isolation, but the thinking may change as more data comes in on the Omicron variant. Recent LSHTM modelling showed that requiring two days of negative LFTs to leave isolation reduced the risk of transmission to almost nil as the likelihood of being infectious after a series of negative lateral flow tests was very low. “But if we find that most individuals test positive for a longer period, this may not address the staffing crisis as desired,” said Billy Quilty, an infectious disease epidemiologist who worked on the modelling. “We urgently need to know how long people are testing positive by lateral flow for on average, and how well this corresponds to the infectious period for Omicron.” Preliminary findings from Japan’s National Institute of Infectious Diseases hint that people who have asymptomatic Omicron infections may stop shedding the virus sooner than those who have symptoms. That asymptomatic infections are typically cleared faster is not unexpected, but the study includes only 21 cases, so the results are considered tentative.",News/World news,PM orders officials to look at cutting Covid isolation period to five days,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/10/pm-orders-officials-to-look-at-cutting-covid-isolation-period-to-five-days
1/11/2022,"Peter Pike, the former Labour MP for Burnley, who has died aged 84, always believed in putting the interests of his constituents before the pursuit of any ambition to achieve personal distinction at Westminster. Such unfashionable altruism for a politician, coupled with diligence and evident decency, won him respect among his parliamentary colleagues and was also duly rewarded by a corresponding 20-fold increase in his majority during more than two decades in the House of Commons. When first elected by a narrow 770 majority in 1983, Pike did realise a personal ambition: to become the Labour MP for the town, an idea that he first articulated as a boy. Born and raised in the Home Counties, he had been evacuated to live with his maternal grandmother in Burnley during the second world war and promised himself that he would return and make it his home in adulthood. When he did so in 1963, he was already politically active in the Labour party and took a job as a full-time party official, first as agent for Burnley’s then Labour MP, Dan Jones, and then, from 1967 to 1973, as a regional organiser in nearby Manchester.  He was born at Ware, Hertfordshire, the eldest of three children of Gladys (nee Cunliffe), who worked as a cleaner, and Leslie Pike, a heating engineer and an active trade unionist. The family lived in Surrey and Peter started his education at Morden Farm school, before transferring to Abel Street school in Burnley. He returned to Surrey and Morden Farm, where he attended the secondary school and then also Hinchley Wood county secondary (now Hinchley Wood school). At the age of 17 he started work as a clerk in the Midland Bank and studied for banking qualifications at evening school at Kingston-upon-Thames Technical College (now Kingston University). After two years’ national service in the Royal Marines (1956-58), he went back to the bank until 1962. Then he spent a year as a clerk with Twining’s Tea before moving to Burnley. Pike had joined the Labour party in 1956 and stood for election to Merton and Morden council in 1960 and 1961, before winning his first council seat in 1962, the year that he married Sheila Bull, who worked as a secretary. He resigned the following year when the couple moved to Burnley, and they swiftly became immersed in local politics there. He consolidated his claim as the eventual successor to Jones by taking a job at Mullards, the local glass factory, where in 1976 he became a trade union shop steward for the GMBATU (General, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied Trades Union; now GMB) and in the same year securing election to Burnley borough council at his third attempt. He was a councillor for the Coal Clough area until 1984 and led the Labour group from 1980 until his election to parliament. There he proved an assiduous committee member. He was appointed first to the environment select committee (1984–90) and subsequently served on committees dealing with procedure (1995-97), modernisation (1997-2005), regulatory reform (1995–2005, of which he was chair from 1997 onwards); and ecclesiastical affairs (2002–05). He was a member of the Commons liaison committee (1997-2005) and the Speaker’s panel of chairmen and chairwomen. On the opposition frontbench he was a spokesman on rural affairs (1990-92) and thereafter on environment and housing, until Tony Blair’s election as leader in 1994. Pike was a Christian Socialist and was in the running for the prestigious post of Second Church Estates Commissioner; in the event, he was deemed too “Old Labour” and out of tune with the dashing modernism of the Blairite vision. Pike’s somewhat dishevelled appearance disguised a hard-working, well-informed and reliable MP. When MPs’ expenses began to be released in 2004 – ahead of the Freedom of Information Act coming into force the following year, and the scandal of 2009 – he was unabashed at being revealed to be the fourth-highest claimant on the list, with expenses of £153,989. He retorted that he worked 70 hours a week, had 1,000 constituency cases in hand and had no problem defending his expenditure. His particular interests, reflecting the concerns of his electorate, lay in housing, environmental protection, road safety and education. He was considerably ahead of his time in expressing anxiety about the need to protect water quality and the damage that he envisaged was threatened by the privatisation of the industry. In his maiden speech he proudly proclaimed himself a socialist, something that, he said, made it difficult for him to conform to the convention of not being controversial, given that the debate he was speaking in concerned the parliamentary programme of Margaret Thatcher’s government. He joined the leftwing Tribune group at Westminster and was a supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the Anti-Apartheid movement, an issue about which he felt particularly strongly. In his first decade as an MP Pike was an active participant in debates about the changes in Sunday trading laws, which led to the Sunday Trading Act 1994, primarily because of his worries about the impact on the community in towns like Burnley with a culture of corner-shop trading. A hugely enthusiastic supporter of Burnley Football Club, he chaired the supporters’ Clarets Trust when he stood down as an MP. He also helped to found the Emmaus Burnley charity for homeless people and was involved in a wide range of local enterprise, church and civic organisations. After just four years as an MP his majority increased tenfold and, at its highest point, when Tony Blair won the 1997 election, it stood at more than 17,000. Pike was succeeded as Labour MP in 2005 by Kitty Ussher. She held the seat for a single term with a majority of 5,778 over the Liberal Democrats, whose candidate then won in 2010. The seat reverted to Labour in 2015 and 2017 but in 2019 was won by Antony Higginbotham for the Conservatives, with a majority of 1,352. Sheila died in 2017, and he is survived by his two daughters, Carol and Jane.

1/11/2022,"Joelle Taylor has won the TS Eliot poetry prize for her look at butch lesbian counterculture in the 1990s, C+nto & Othered Poems, praised by judges as “a blazing book of rage and light”. A mix of memoir and conjecture, the collection, Taylor’s fourth, reveals the underground communities forged by women where they could reclaim their bodies as their own. It was announced on Monday night in London that C+nto had beaten collections by major names including Raymond Antrobus, Selima Hill and Michael Symmons Roberts to the £25,000 prize. The TS Eliot award is one of the most prestigious prizes in British poetry and has been won in the past by Ted Hughes, Carol Ann Duffy and, last year, Bhanu Kapil.  “Every book on the shortlist had a strong claim on the award. We found it extremely hard to choose between 10 superb collections,” said chair of judges Glyn Maxwell, who selected the winner along with Caroline Bird and Zaffar Kunial. “The arguments towards the end were passionate and thoughtful, but the choice of the judging panel is Joelle Taylor’s C+nto and Othered Poems, a blazing book of rage and light, a grand opera of liberation from the shadows of indifference and oppression.” Maxwell said the winning collection was “pretty autobiographical, about her life as a butch lesbian, and the hostility she suffered as a kid in a conventional family”. “But then there’s also imaginative renderings of nightlife – of lesbian clubs, some of which are kind of hellish and some of which are heavenly,” he said. “It’s kind of enraged, but it’s this sort of rage which generates light, and it’s a really vivid read – it’s quite something.” Run by the TS Eliot Foundation, the award is the most valuable prize in British poetry, and the only one judged purely by established poets. Taylor is a former UK slam champion, who founded the UK’s youth slam championships, SLAMbassadors, in 2001. “Joelle originates in performance,” said Maxwell. “This collection proves that at the top level, there’s very little difference between that, and what’s on the page.” The collection, Taylor writes in her preface, is a delve into her own personal history, looking at her “exile as a consequence of my sexuality”, as well as an excavation of others’ pasts through interviews and archives. “It is important that we preserve our history,” she writes. “I interviewed other butch lesbians from that era, and together we began to construct a simple story: exile, friendship, grief, love, courage and threat.” The collection opens as Taylor imagines Soho and its bars as a museum, behind glass: “Everything, vitrine. / Glass cases line the old roads // materialising beside / cruising grounds & cottages // squats & roughs / fishbowl cenotaphs.” In O, Maryville, the narrative follows one night in a lesbian bar, revolving the story around four butch lesbians who observe and protect the space, holding their ground even when the bar is demolished. In “the body as battleground”, she writes of how “you fall miss your body entirely land somewhere / in enemy territory behind the lines your body a / foreign country you cannot get a visa for”. “There is no part of a butch lesbian that is welcome in this world. It was bad when I was a teenager. It is as bad today,” Taylor writes in her preface, revealing that as a young teenager “stepping tentatively out of the closet in the early 1980s”, she was “subjected to constant state-endorsed abuse”. Today, she says, war is “rag[ing] across social media”, and “we spend more time policing each other than protecting”. C+nto, she says, is intended “both to acknowledge the crimes against the LGBT community and reflect back to a time when we had a greater sense of unity, of self”. Published by the Westbourne Press, C+nto has been described as “visionary and powerful” by Hollie McNish, and as “one of the most astonishing and original poetry collections of recent years” by Bernardine Evaristo in the New Statesman.

1/11/2022,"In his old life, Jeremy Clarkson conceded he might have been prepared to pave over the British countryside – but the former petrolhead-in-chief has insisted he is a changed man. As a farmer, he was trying to do his bit to save the countryside by turning his recently built lambing shed into a restaurant serving locally produced food at his Diddly Squat farm in the Cotswolds, he told planning subcommittee officials in the small Oxfordshire town of Witney.  The conversion, along with the 70-space car park, was merely “diversification of a farming business”, Clarkson told the planning officials. But they did not agree. After they pointed out that the restaurant on a prominent spot could cause case “great harm” to the designated area of outstanding natural beauty, councillors rejected the plan on Monday. It will probably not be the end of the matter. Outside the council building, Clarkson said it was “a bad day for farming” and vowed to appeal. The changed man jumped into a Range Rover and took a swipe at one of the council officials, comparing him to the comedian Eric Morecambe – “but not as funny”. Ultimately, win or lose, the saga will, no doubt, be lapped up by the audience of his Amazon Prime reality show, Clarkson’s Farm. The hugely popular show is seen as a mixed blessing in the area. It has brought in business, with fans lining up for hours for the chance to buy produce, or a souvenir, from his farm shop in the village of Chadlington. But it has also caused an unwelcome stir in this most picturesque and peaceful landscape, plus traffic chaos. Appearing before West Oxfordshire district council’s uplands area planning subcommittee, the former Top Gear presenter began by thanking the members for having him along and said he found the experience “nerve-racking.” He said the planners had made much of the fact that his scheme to convert the shed built in 2020 into a restaurant was in an area of outstanding natural beauty – and agreed that it was. But he told the committee: “The reason it is, is because farmers maintain it, farmers look after the woodlands, the hedges, the streams. They keep it beautiful. The farmers are not going to be able to do that for much longer because of the parlous state of their finances. We have been told as farmers to diversify and that is exactly what this proposal is; it’s a diversification of a farming business.” Clarkson said his farm would provide beef to the restaurant while others in the areas would supply other locally produced food. He said local farmers were delighted and that one had recently told him tearfully that she would have gone out of business were it not for the boost his farm shop had provided. The TV star took a swipe at spelling mistakes in the council officer’s report before admitting: “In my old job, I might have paved over the countryside, but I’ve moved on from that and I don’t want to do any such thing.” Clarkson was asked why he had stopped trying to use the lambing shed for sheep. He replied that he had “put a toe” in the water and found that sheep farming was not viable. He was merging his flock with a neighbour’s. There was some support for his cause. One councillor, Alex Postan, pointed out that a nearby caravan park was already a “blot on the landscape”, so another might not hurt so much. He agreed that farmers needed all the help they could, otherwise the world was heading for food and water wars. The local ward councillor, Dean Temple, said people in the area used to have two job choices: farm worker or working in service, “Downton Abbey-style”. But most of those jobs had gone and anything that helped employment was to be welcomed. But he said he had to vote against the plan with “heavy heart” because of the impact on a beautiful area. There were 56 letters of objection and 13 of support. Addressing the meeting on behalf of one resident, barrister Charles Streeten claimed the lambing shed had been a “Trojan horse” for the restaurant. He said Clarkson had a “general disregard” for the planning rules and claimed his conduct was “shameful”, adding: “It indicates a ‘give me an inch and I’ll take a mile’ attitude.”",News/Media,Jeremy Clarkson fails to win approval for Cotswolds restaurant,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/10/jeremy-clarkson-fails-to-win-approval-for-cotswolds-restaurant
