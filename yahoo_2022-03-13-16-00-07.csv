 Alabama residents will no longer be required to hold a permit to conceal and carry a handgun in the state after Gov. Kay Ivey (R) on Thursday signed a bill effectuating the change into law. The bill, which was passed along party lines with major Republican support and Democrat opposition, takes effect in January of next year, according to a press release from the governor's office. Ivey said she was defending Second Amendment rights in her state. ""Unlike most states who are doing everything in their power to make it harder for law abiding citizens, Alabama is reaffirming our commitment to defending our Second Amendment rights,"" the governor said in a statement. ""I have always stood up for the rights of law abiding gunowners, and I am proud to do that again."" Alabama becomes the 22nd state to not require a permit to conceal and carry a firearm, according to the Pew Research Organization. Last year, six states - Arkansas, Iowa, Montana, Tennessee, Texas and Utah - passed bills bypassing the permit process for some firearms. Also this week, Georgia's state House and Senate passed a similar bill not requiring a permit to conceal and carry a handgun, a measure expected to eventually be signed into law by Gov. Brian Kemp (R). In Alabama, the new law eliminates ""the requirement for a person to obtain a concealed carry permit to lawfully carry a pistol,"" according to a text of the passed bill. Some police spoke out against the bill, including the Alabama Sheriff's Association. Edward Delmore, a police chief in the community of Gulf Shore, said ""this bill doesn't comply with common sense,"" during a protest against the measure earlier this year, according to the Alabama News Network. ""No one up here is anti-Second Amendment,"" he said. ""Some have said that, it can't be further from the truth."" But the measure won support from the National Rifle Association (NRA), which said in a Thursday tweet that ""Alabamians are safer for it."" It also had the backing of some GOP former law enforcement officials in the state congress, AL.com reported.",U.S./The Hill,"Alabama joins Georgia, 20 other states in getting rid of conceal carry permits",https://news.yahoo.com/alabama-joins-georgia-20-other-214618754.html
3/13/2022,"A top Google executive in Moscow was threatened by Russian agents last September, per The Washington Post. She was told to remove an anti-Putin app or face going to prison, the newspaper said. Google reluctantly removed the app, used to help Russians register protest votes, The Post said. Russian agents arrived at the home of a top Google executive in Moscow to deliver a frightening ultimatum last September, according to The Washington Post. The unnamed executive was told that she would have to remove an app from the Google app store within 24 hours or go to prison, people familiar with the matter told The Post. The app, according to the newspaper, had angered Russian President Vladimir Putin because it was used to help Russians register protest votes against his United Russia party in the undemocratic legislative election in 2021. The Smart Voting App was set up by Putin's political rival Alexei Navalny, the newspaper said, who was imprisoned in 2021 after a poisoning attempt failed to kill him. After receiving the threat at her home, Google moved the executive to a hotel. She checked in using a fake name to ensure her safety, The Post reported. Company officials assumed that the presence of hotel security guards and other guests might protect her, sources told the newspaper under the condition of anonymity. The same agents later visited her hotel room. They warned her the clock was ticking on the 24-hour ultimatum, per The Post. Google officials believe the agents were from the FSB — the KGB's main successor organization. Human-rights groups have warned that the FSB uses its powers to intimidate and stifle dissent, Insider previously reported. After being poisoned, Alexander Litvinenko, a former FSB agent who died in 2006, accused the agency of running a top-secret hit squad targeting political enemies. Litvinenko later died. Google in Russia had previously resisted removing the app, according to The Post. It held off from delisting it from its search engine following an order from a Moscow court on September 3, the newspaper reported. On September 14, The Post noted, armed Russian police intimidated employees by showing up to the Google offices in Moscow. At the time, The New York Times reported that Russian authorities named specific individuals who would face prosecution if the app wasn't removed. The app was disconnected the morning after the executive was threatened in her hotel room, The Post reported. Removing it from the Google app store was not popular with many employees, and the decision was made reluctantly, the newspaper said. ""We resisted this position for as long as possible,"" an email to staff said, per The Post. ""Nothing is more important to Google than the safety and well-being of our employees."" Insider contacted Google for comment on Saturday afternoon but did not immediately receive a response. Apple's main representative in Moscow was also threatened, said The Post but provided no further information. Russia has continued to crackdown on Western technology amid the invasion of Ukraine. Russia's communications agency Roskomnadzor announced that it would ban Instagram in the country from March 14, according to the agency's website.
