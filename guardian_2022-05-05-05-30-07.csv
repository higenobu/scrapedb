5/5/2022,"Arsenal ensured the destination of the WSL trophy will be decided on the final day of the season, with a 3-0 defeat of Tottenham at the Emirates Stadium keeping them in the hunt for the title. A fourth-minute strike from influential forward Beth Mead and two second-half goals from Caitlin Foord moved the Gunners back to within a point of the league leaders Chelsea with one game to play. In the eight competitive fixtures played between the two sides since Tottenham were promoted to the WSL in 2019, Arsenal have won seven times (including a win on penalties in the League Cup) and lost none, with the sole draw between them coming in the reverse fixture in November. In those eight games, Arsenal scored 29 goals and conceded just five times. The Gunners’ draw with Tottenham in November, with a stoppage-time equaliser from forward Vivianne Miedema required to deny the home team three points at the Hive, signalled that the gap is closing between the women’s football heavyweights and their north London rivals. After a blistering start to the season, the two points dropped at the Hive was the first blemish on an immaculate Gunners league campaign. After that match, the Tottenham manager, Rehanne Skinner, said that Arsenal and England centre-back Leah Williamson had told her that the progress of Spurs was making this “a proper north London derby”. Keen to capitalise on the budding competitiveness between the two teams, Arsenal arranged for the tie to be played at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday 26 March. The postponement then due to a Covid outbreak at Tottenham was frustrating, as the fixture was shunted from a prime weekend slot to Wednesday evening. The turnout was impacted, with half of the open lower tier a fair way under capacity. Within four minutes though, those that had turned up were treated to a first WSL north London derby goal at the Emirates. A purposeful pass from Williamson was latched onto by Mead who ran into the box, shifted the ball onto her left foot and fired low past Tinja-Riikka Korpela. In the buildup, the Arsenal manager, Jonas Eidevall, had pointed to the potential for the tie to be a bruising one. “When you look at it statistically,” he said. “We are the team that has the ball in play the most in the WSL, Spurs are second bottom of that metric. One team wants the ball in play and the other doesn’t. When we played them in November, there were 22 fouls from Spurs whereas we are rarely over 10 fouls. “It’s a physical, gritty side that we’re going to play against that will try to take the tempo out of the game and they are very good at doing that. I respect them for doing that, we want to showcase our football and to create and have the ball in play. It will be exciting to see which style will win the game.” He wasn’t wrong. By half-time Spurs had conceded eight fouls to Arsenal’s one, with midfielder Maéva Clemaron and forward Rachel Williams, scorer of Tottenham’s opener in November, particularly tough in the tackle. Manchester City put themselves in the driving seat for Champions League qualification after a 6-0 victory over Birmingham, who were relegated from the Women’s Super League. Gareth Taylor’s side moved above rivals Manchester United into third, meaning they only need a point in Sunday’s final-day clash with Reading to seal a European spot – barring a huge swing in goal difference. That looks more than likely after they racked up an eighth WSL win in a row, with Georgia Stanway (2), Lauren Hemp, Alanna Kennedy, Chloe Kelly and Laura Coombs getting on the scoresheet in another goal glut just days after putting seven past Brighton. The defeat for Blues ended their stay in the WSL, of which they were a founder member in 2010. All six goals came in the second half as Stanway opened the scoring in the 57th minute with a low drive from 20 yards and Hemp made it two three minutes later with a close-range finish. The floodgates had opened after Stanway added her second with a tap-in just after the hour, with Kennedy then heading home a corner and Kelly converting from close range. Coombs rounded off the scoring in the 88th minute when she found the net from the edge of the area. PA Media Not long after Mead’s opening goal, Spurs went agonisingly close to an equaliser as the ball pinballed around the Arsenal box before Mead blocked Kyah Simon’s effort and Miedema cleared off the line from the Australian shortly after. Simon, who picked up a yellow card was hooked at half-time in favour of Finnish midfielder Eveliina Summanen, who took just 15 minutes to get in the book herself. In the second half the story was similar, with Arsenal controlling possession and pushing for a second but struggling to break through the banks of organised white shirts. In the 71st minute they finally squeezed through. Miedema’s short corner to Mead was played back to the Dutch forward whose shot was saved by the foot of Korpela only for Foord to poke in at the back post. Less than 10 minutes later it was three as Miedema clipped the ball wide to Mead, who did the same to Foord waiting to her left, and the Australian forward took one touch before curling the ball into the top corner. Spurs had the chance of a consolation from the penalty spot in added time as Angela Addison went down, softly, in the area under pressure from defender Lotte Wubben-Moy but Addison’s penalty came back off the upright. Arsenal’s hope of dethroning reigning champions Chelsea remains alive, just. The Gunners must win at West Ham on Sunday lunchtime and hope that Manchester United can deny Chelsea victory at Kingsmeadow to send the trophy north across the river.",Sport/Football,Mead and Foord strike as Arsenal beat Spurs to take WSL title race to final day,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/04/arsenal-tottenham-wsl-match-report

5/5/2022,"Academic Lea Ypi’s “darkly humorous and deeply serious” memoir, Free, which speaks “so resonantly to our lived moment”, has won the Royal Society of Literature’s Ondaatje prize. The award is given for books that “best evoke the spirit of a place”. Free chronicles Ypi’s coming-of-age in Albania at a time when it was one of the last Stalinist outposts in Europe. In December 1990, statues of Stalin and Hoxha were toppled, and life changed overnight for people, who were now able to vote freely, wear what they liked and worship as they wished. But the change also saw jobs disappear and predatory pyramid schemes lead to the country being bankrupted, resulting in violent conflict. As her own family’s secrets were revealed, Ypi found herself questioning what freedom really meant. Chairing the judging panel was poet Sandeep Parmar, joined by YA author Patrice Lawrence and writer and lawyer Philippe Sands. They said of Free: “Reading and rereading Lea Ypi’s Free we felt very strongly that the book’s central concerns – politics, personal history, the very meaning of freedom – spoke so resonantly to our lived moment.” The judges described Ypi as “a master” of juxtaposing grand and personal narratives. They also praised the way her “darkly humorous and deeply serious work” made them “reflect forcefully on the need for truthfulness about the stories we are told and how we negotiate our own lives within them.” Ypi, who has been awarded £10,000 in prize money, is a professor of political theory at the London School of Economics and Political Science and adjunct professor in philosophy at the Australian National University. She was announced as the winner by RSL president emeritus Colin Thubron on behalf of the prize founder and funder, Sir Christopher Ondaatje, at an event at Two Temple Place in London. Free was chosen as the winner from a shortlist of six books. The others in contention were The Manningtree Witches by AK Blakemore, Islands of Abandonment: Life in the Post-Human Landscape by Cal Flyn, Writing the Camp by Yousif M Qasmiyeh, Empireland by Sathnam Sanghera and The Island of Missing Trees by Elif Shafak. The prize was won in 2021 by Ruth Gilligan’s thriller The Butchers. Previous winners include former MP Alan Johnson for his memoir This Boy, and Guardian journalist Aida Edemariam for her account of her grandmother’s life story, The Wife’s Tale.",Arts/Books," Lea Ypi wins Ondaatje prize for ‘deeply serious’ memoir, Free",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/04/lea-ypi-wins-ondaatje-prize-for-deeply-serious-memoir-free
5/5/2022,"Amber Heard took the witness stand in a Virginia court on Wednesday afternoon during Johnny Depp’s defamation lawsuit against her – a make-or-break moment for the actors in a four-week trial that had so far largely focused on Depp’s version of events during their turbulent 15-month marriage. “I struggle to find the words to describe how painful this is … this is horrible for me to sit here for weeks and relive everything, to hear people that I knew, some well, some not, my ex-husband with whom I shared a life, speak about our lives in the way they have,” she said. “This has been one of the most painful and difficult things I’ve ever gone through, for sure,” Heard added. Heard described typical activities from her upbringing in Texas, ranging from breaking in horses to working at her father’s construction company, where she answered phones then working at a modelling agency, where she earned enough to have professional photographs taken, and her move to Hollywood. “I went from slightly bigger role to slightly bigger role, and worked my butt off,” Heard testified. The 36-year-old’s testimony in the US courtroom began as gender stereotyping became the focus of proceedings concerning the two actors on Wednesday. Depp’s attorney, Wayne Dennison, argued that Heard’s witness, Dawn Hughes, had, in almost every instance, referred to a victim of interpersonal violence as she or her, despite warning about gender stereotypes when talking about the matter. Depp, 58, has testified that he never struck Heard, and that, in fact, he was the victim of abuse, and was punched and struck by his wife on many occasions. Depp described Heard to the jury as having a “need for conflict”. Depp’s lawyers were seeking to undercut Hughes’s testimony from Tuesday when she said Heard was subjected to multiple acts of abuse – physical, sexual, psychological and emotional – by Depp during her 16-month marriage to the actor, beginning in 2015. Heard now suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, Heard’s lawyers said. Hughes acknowledged that Heard perpetrated physical violence against Depp but said it did not amount to the scale or frequency of violence she had been subjected to. Jurors were played an audio recording of a fight between Depp and Heard, in which she says “I did start a physical fight” but had hit, not punched Depp. Hughes was asked if what is heard on the tape can be characterized as “reactive” or retaliatory violence that she had previously described. “If it’s true, if she hit him first, then that would not be reactive violence,” she said. The court was shown the image of Depp’s injured finger after a fight in Australia, and of the actor on a gurney in hospital. “What about if you throw a bottle of vodka because your husband fell off the wagon. Is that reactive violence?” Hughes was asked. “If it’s in the middle of an assault, perhaps,” Hughes said. Asked what about if a second bottle of vodka is thrown because the first bottle-projectile misses. “I don’t think throwing bottles is acceptable in any context,” Hughes said. Depp’s attorneys said that despite PTSD symptoms her lawyers claim she suffers from as a result of Depp’s violence, Heard had nonetheless been able to film Aquaman, and had told the psychologist she loved to cook, hike and spend time with friends. Depp’s attorney added that she had also had a baby, exercises every day, and completed level-three sommelier training. “She does does these things, but it’s not like the symptoms aren’t there,” Hughes said. “She has to continue to work, even though she has a panic attack, even though she has an intrusive recollection of the trauma, even though she’s having heart palpitations and sweaty palms when something comes into her mind,” Hughes said. Depp’s lawyers also drew attention to James Franco and Elon Musk, whom Heard met at the Met Ball in New York in early May 2016, during their marriage. Heard and Musk began dating “some time after” she filed a temporary restraining order against Depp on 27 May, Hughes said. Musk is not expected to testify. Ellen Barkin, a former of girlfriend of Depp’s, may offer evidence for Heard. Depp’s team also drew attention to a large knife engraved with “until death” in Spanish that Amber Heard had given her former husband. His lawyers argued that Heard would not have given Depp a knife he she was truly afraid of him. Hughes said it was a gift made while Depp was filming The Lone Ranger and was in “a turquoise phase”. “She purchased him that because she thought it would be a kind gift. The phraseology refers to Mr Depp telling her the only way out of this relationship is death.”",News/US news,Amber Heard testifies in Johnny Depp defamation trial: ‘This is horrible for me’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/04/amber-heard-testifies-johnny-depp-defamation-trial
