5/19/2022,"A landmark bill to legalise voluntary assisted dying in New South Wales remains on track to pass through the state’s upper house, after a marathon debate which lasted until midnight on Wednesday night and will resume on Thursday. The legislation is set to reach a final vote in the upper house this week, after members debated 92 late amendments for 12 hours on Wednesday. . The approval of some amendments means the bill will now need to return to the lower house – six months after it passed there despite the opposition of both the premier, Dominic Perrottet, and Labor leader, Chris Minns, – before it can become law. Although the bill enjoys a clear majority in the upper house - including support from all six Nationals MPs - opponents staged a prolonged filibuster, moving dozens of amendments in a bid to slow the bill’s passage. Many of those had been heard during the debate in the lower house last year, including an amendment which would prevent health care workers from raising the option of voluntary assisted dying with patients. That amendment, as with dozens of others, was defeated. Two technical amendments put forward by the education minister, Sarah Mitchell, were approved, as well as one moved by the Nationals and one from Labor MP Greg Donnelly, who proposed more than 30 amendments. The changes mean the bill will have to return to the parliament’s lower house before it becomes law. Mitchell said she intended to vote in favour of the bill. “It’s important that members have the chance to raise any amendments that they may have,” Mitchell said. “But I would certainly like to see that bill completed this week.” The bill, introduced by the independent MP Alex Greenwich with 28 co-sponsors, limits access to voluntary assisted dying to people with terminal illnesses who will die within six months, or 12 months in the case of a person with a neurodegenerative condition experiencing unbearable suffering. The person must be found to have capacity to make the decision to go ahead voluntarily without duress, and the application would be assessed by two medical practitioners. Donnelly also proposed an amendment that would allow religious residential aged care facilities to ban residents from accessing voluntary assisted dying. He suggested it would allow terminally ill patients to move to facilities that did not oppose voluntary assisted dying, but the amendments were defeated. The minister for regional health, Bronnie Taylor, spoke to oppose that amendment, saying the bill went far enough to appease the rights of aged care institutions. “People in aged care, in any form of residential care and in hospitals, must retain the right to make choices about their life, their life and their options,” Taylor said. “Why would we support a law aimed at substituting their decisions over their life with those of distanced boards and directors?” Taylor, who previously worked as a clinical nurse specialising in palliative care, said she spoke with experience. “I absolutely respect a person’s choice. This is about choice.” The numbers in the lower house mean the bill will almost certainly pass into law following the upper house debate. It would make NSW the final state in the commonwealth to pass voluntary assisted dying legislation. Victoria passed what the premier, Daniel Andrews, described as the most conservative euthanasia regime in the world when it passed in 2017. ​​Kiki Paul, the chief executive of Go Gentle Australia, an advocacy group supporting the laws, said the NSW bill’s progress had been “exceedingly slow”. “But we have been buoyed by the resounding defeat of the first two sets of opponents’ amendments - which augurs well for the final vote,” she said. Opponents of the bill characterised the changes as an attempt to provide additional safeguards. “I am an opponent of the bill, but I believe that we need to deal with the reality that is before us, which is that the Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill will pass this parliament,” the Liberal Party MP Scott Farlow said. “That is not something that I will celebrate but it is reality. In passing the bill, I think that we need to have as many protections in place as possible.” - Australian Associated Press contributed to this report",News/Australia news,Midnight sitting of NSW upper house fails to resolve debate over assisted dying bill,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/19/midnight-sitting-of-nsw-upper-house-fails-to-resolve-debate-over-assisted-dying-bill
5/19/2022,"The White House is braced for a North Korean missile or nuclear test while Joe Biden is on a trip to South Korea and Japan, which begins on Thursday. The national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told reporters on Wednesday: “Our intelligence does reflect the genuine possibility that there will be either a further missile test, including long-range missile test, or a nuclear test, or frankly both in the days leading into on or after the president’s trip to the region.” “We are preparing for all contingencies, including the possibility that such a provocation would occur while we are in Korea or in Japan,” Sullivan added. Biden’s trip is intended in part to signal that he has not forgotten about US strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific despite the focus since February on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “The message we’re trying to send on this trip is a message of an affirmative vision of what the world can look like, if the democracies and open societies of the world stand together to shape the rules of the road, to define the security architecture of the region to reinforce strong, powerful historic alliances,” Sullivan said. Biden is due to leave for South Korea on Thursday for talks with the country’s new president, Yoon Suk Yeol. According to the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, he will not be visiting the demilitarised zone between the two Koreas. The president is then expected to travel to Japan on Sunday for a summit of the Quad, comprising US, Japan, Australia and India. US and South Korean intelligence have been briefing for some days that it is possible North Korea could conduct a nuclear test, which would be its first in five years. In March, the Pyongyang regime carried out its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in four years, and has performed three other missile tests since then. CNN cited unnamed officials on Wednesday as saying new missile launch preparations had been observed at a launch site under satellite surveillance near Pyongyang. Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia nonproliferation programme at the Middlebury Institute for International Studies, said there had been general indications of impending nuclear or missile tests, including activity at North Korea’s nuclear test site. He pointed out Kim Jong-un recently talked about the need to “ simultaneously push ahead with the material and technological preparations to cope with the future threats and challenges in an all-round way”. “This might mean either a nuclear or a missile test,” Lewis said, but added: “I suspect that North Korea’s schedule has more to do with their own political concerns and technical factors more than Biden’s trip.”",News/World news,White House braced for North Korean nuclear test during Biden’s Asia trip,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/18/north-korea-white-house-nuclear-biden

5/19/2022,"Afghan armed forces collapsed last year because they had been made dependent on US support that was abruptly withdrawn in the face of a Taliban offensive, according to a scathing assessment by a US government watchdog. A report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (Sigar) on the catastrophic defeat that led to the fall of Kabul on 15 August, blamed the administrations of Donald Trump and Joe Biden as well as the Afghan government of Ashraf Ghani. “Sigar found that the single most important factor in the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces’ (ANDSF) collapse in August 2021 was the decision by two US presidents to withdraw US military and contractors from Afghanistan, while Afghan forces remained unable to sustain themselves,” said the congressionally-mandated report, which was released on Wednesday. The Sigar account focused on the impact of two critical events that it said doomed the Afghan forces: the February 2020 Doha agreement between the Trump administration and the Taliban, and then Biden’s April 2021 decision to pull out all US troops by September, without leaving a residual force. “Due to the ANDSF’s dependency on US military forces, these events destroyed ANDSF morale,” the inspector general said. “The ANDSF had long relied on the US military’s presence to protect against large-scale ANDSF losses, and Afghan troops saw the United States as a means of holding their government accountable for paying their salaries. The US-Taliban agreement made it clear that this was no longer the case, resulting in a sense of abandonment within the ANDSF and the Afghan population.” The ANDSF were dependent on US troops and contractors because that was how the forces were developed, the report argued, noting “the United States designed the ANDSF as a mirror image of US forces”. “The United States created a combined arms military structure that required a high degree of professional military sophistication and leadership,” it said. “The United States also created a non-commissioned officer corps which had no foundation in Afghanistan military history.” It would have taken decades to build a modern, cohesive and self-reliant force, the Sigar document argued. The Afghan air force, the main military advantage the government had over the Taliban, had not been projected to be self-sufficient until 2030 at the earliest. Within weeks of Biden’s withdrawal announcement, the contractors who maintained planes and helicopters left. As a result, there were not enough functioning aircraft to get weapons and supplies to Afghan forces around the country, leaving them without ammunition, food and water in the face of renewed Taliban attacks. The US had begun cutting off air support to the Afghan army after the Doha agreement was signed. Exacerbating its impact on morale was the fact that the deal had secret annexes, widely believed to stipulate the Taliban’s counter-terrorism commitments and restrictions on fighting for both the US and Taliban. They remain secret, apparently, even from an official enquiry. “Sigar was not able to obtain copies of these annexes, despite official requests made to the US department of defence and the US department of state,” the report observes. The secrecy led to unintended consequences, the report said. “Taliban propaganda weaponised that vacuum against local commanders and elders by claiming the Taliban had a secret deal with the United States for certain districts or provinces to be surrendered to them,” it said. The Sigar report also blames the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, who changed ANDSF commanders during the Taliban offensive, appointing aged loyalists from the Communist era, while marginalising well-trained ANDSF officers aligned with the US. It quotes one unnamed former Afghan government official as saying that after the Doha agreement, “President Ghani began to suspect that the United States wanted to remove him from power.” According to the former official and a former Afghan government Ghani was afraid of a military coup. He became a “paranoid president…afraid of his own countrymen” and particularly of US-trained Afghan officers. Ghani fled Afghanistan on the day Kabul fell.",News/World news,"US withdrawal triggered catastrophic defeat of Afghan forces, damning watchdog report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/18/afghanistan-us-withdrawal-defeat-watchdog-report-sigar
