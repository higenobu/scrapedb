2/23/2022,"Mark Lanegan, who died on Tuesday morning at the age of 57, was perhaps the greatest singer of his generation. His remarkable gift was apparent from his earliest work with Screaming Trees: a worn, soulful burr betraying heavy emotional and physical mileage, but possessed of considerable dignity, vulnerability and heroism. It only deepened as he pursued a lauded solo career, served as floating vocalist-in-residence with Queens of the Stone Age and engaged in collaborations with artists including Isobel Campbell, Greg Dulli, Martina Topley-Bird and Manic Street Preachers. A drug user and alcoholic for many years, Lanegan wove his agonising struggle with addiction into a grim, gripping memoir, 2020’s remarkably frank Sing Backwards and Weep, at the insistence of his late friend Anthony Bourdain. His 2021 bout of Covid-19 – which left him hospitalised for weeks – yielded a further tome, Devil in a Coma, published in December.  The widespread acclaim Lanegan enjoyed through the latter half of his career seemed unimaginable during the years he toiled with Screaming Trees. Lanegan first met the group’s founders, brothers Gary Lee and Van Conner, in the early 80s while working for their parents, repossessing televisions from trailer park residents in his home town of Ellensburg, Washington. Signed to legendary underground label SST Records, and releasing several overlooked, undersold albums throughout the decade, Screaming Trees was fractious from the out, Lanegan resenting guitarist Gary Lee’s creative control of their output and penchant for acid-rock written in a register higher than Lanegan could comfortably sing. Lanegan wrested control for Sweet Oblivion, the Trees’ second album for Epic Records, penning the lyrics and singing them in the forbidding baritone that he’d begun developing on tracks such as Grey Diamond Desert from 1988’s Invisible Lantern, and that became his trademark. Sweet Oblivion arrived in 1992, just as the underground scene of the Pacific north-west suddenly went overground, thanks to the success of groups including Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains. These groups were Lanegan’s friends – “Kurt [Cobain] was like a little brother, [Alice in Chains frontman] Layne Staley was like a twin,” Lanegan told Spin last year – and Screaming Trees were tipped for similar stardom. But while Sweet Oblivion and its 1996 follow-up Dust were majestic records, matching the intensity of Lanegan’s vocals to high-impact heavy rock (grunge never burned with such eloquent, self-lacerating regret as on No One Knows) Screaming Trees seemed doomed by both their in-fighting and Lanegan’s snowballing taste for self-destruction. A fractious 1996 stint supporting Oasis on a high-profile US tour saw Lanegan tangle backstage with Liam Gallagher, an encounter recounted with scathing hilarity in Sing Backwards and Weep. Another Trees tour the following year was sidelined after Lanegan was arrested for possession of crack cocaine, a crack-pipe and a hypodermic needle. Dust was the final album the group would release in its lifetime. Lanegan had been boozing since he was 12 years old, and a doctor had told him at the age of 20 that he wouldn’t live to see another decade if he didn’t quit drinking; he initially turned to heroin “to save me from becoming an alcoholic”. His memoir offers harrowing accounts of the depths to which his addictions pushed him, ruining friendships and debasing himself physically and mentally in pursuit of a fix. His substance abuse accelerated following Cobain’s death, as Lanegan struggled with his guilt over scoring heroin for the Nirvana frontman and ignoring his phone calls in the days before his suicide. The intervention of Cobain’s widow Courtney Love – who once described Lanegan as “Seattle’s Nick Cave” and paid for him to enter rehab – helped save his life. “It was the end of a nightmare that had lasted for years and years,” he told me in 2004. “Nobody likes to believe they need anybody’s help in anything, and the smarter you are – and I’m not smart – or the tougher you are – and I thought I was pretty tough – the more trouble you have. The smartest guys I ever met are not around any more because they thought they could think their way out of an unthinkable situation, and the tough guys have to just be beaten up repeatedly. And some guys just never do make it out.” While living in a post-rehab halfway house, Lanegan recorded Scraps at Midnight, the third in a series of dark, mature solo albums he’d begun with 1990’s The Winding Sheet (on which he’d been backed by Nirvana for a chilling cover of Leadbelly’s Where Did You Sleep Last Night, years before Cobain’s own MTV Unplugged version). On these early solo records, Lanegan channelled his love for folk, country and blues, drawing inspiration from Van Morrison and Cormac McCarthy, and showcasing a complexity that had been overshadowed by the Conner brothers’ guitar heroics. He was at the halfway house when Josh Homme, who’d played second guitar on the final Screaming Trees tours, approached him to join his new band, Queens of the Stone Age. He had to turn the offer down, but later stepped aboard Homme’s unruly alt-rock pirate ship for their 2000 breakthrough Rated R, his weighty growl grounding the album’s abundant debauchery on comedown blues Into the Fade, and delivering highlights of 2002 follow-up Songs for the Deaf like the doomy thrash of Song for the Dead. While he subsequently exited the core group, he remained a member-at-large, guesting on later albums. With his solo work showcasing his skills as a singer and songwriter, and QOTSA scoring commercial success he’d never previously tasted, Lanegan cut loose over the last two decades of his life. He was prolific like never before, and shared his gifts with a list of collaborators both inspired and unexpected. With Belle and Sebastian’s Isobel Campbell, he cut three albums that brilliantly inverted the paradigm set by Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra decades earlier (“I write the songs and he’s the eye-candy,” Campbell told me. “Sometimes, we’ll be on stage, and he’s singing The Circus Is Leaving Town, and it sounds so sad, so true, I want to cry”). With longtime friend and kindred spirit Greg Dulli, he recorded a sublime album of soulful regret as the Gutter Twins. He worked alongside PJ Harvey and Slash, and undertook projects with lesser-known talents including Duke Garwood, Soulsavers and Joe Cardamone. His energy was fearsome, his approach fearless; his later albums embraced electronic music (2012’s Blues Funeral) and icy post-punk (2019’s Somebody’s Knocking), his final album, 2020’s Straight Songs of Sorrow, inspired by the experience of writing his memoir. Fifty-seven is no age to die, especially for a man with a voice that promised only to grow richer and more variegated with age, a voice that had earned a place alongside greats such as his beloved Johnny Cash. He’d outlived so many of his friends – Cobain, Staley, Bourdain – which is a curse all its own. But in those years his doctor had said he’d never get to taste, he created some of the greatest music of his career, found love with his second wife, Shelley Brien, located a unique voice as a prose writer, and lived long enough for his gifts to be recognised. “I feel that the fellas and myself didn’t get our due,” he told me in 2004, the ignominy suffered by Screaming Trees clearly still painful. Eighteen years later, Lanegan was finally accruing those dues, and it’s a tragedy his story ends so soon.",Arts/Music,Mark Lanegan defied darkness to become one of his generation’s most soulful singers,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/23/mark-lanegan-defied-darkness-to-become-one-of-his-generations-most-soulful-singers
2/23/2022,"Another day, another Yorkshire cricket story, only this time it has nothing to do with events at Headingley and everything to do with a very different type of dark cloud. Of the three storms to hit the UK over the past week – Dudley, Eunice and Franklin – it is Franklin that has done the most damage to clubs, due to the huge volume of rain that has barrelled down, especially in the north of the country, specifically in Yorkshire. Early Yorkshire casualties include Bradford & Bingley CC, Ilkley CC, Olicanians CC, Horbury Bridge CC, Mytholmroyd CC, Bridgeholme CC and Greetland CC.  Horbury Bridge is entirely underwater, flooding on Sunday evening. The club president Danny Terry found out around midnight when the landlord of the pub that sits on the corner of the cricket field phoned him to say the River Calder had topped the bank and was flowing on to the field. “It currently looks like a reservoir,” he says, “a metre of water over the entire playing surface. And the square is what we’re worried about most of all – the outfield is not a real concern. We spend a lot of money at the end of each season to make the square ready for the next season, doing the prep work, and now all that work and money has been written off. When the flood water recedes we’ll have to look at a recovery plan which will cost a considerable amount of money, we’re particularly worried about invasive plants, like moss, that come with the flooding. “I’ve been involved in the club for more than 15 years and only in the last five years has the playing surface been underwater – this year and last year.” Last year’s flood happened at around the same time, but the club started the season on the button thanks to Wakefield Metropolitan council pumping the water away. Terry hopes that the council will help them again. “We’re not allowed to pump the water out of the field ourselves and if we just have to wait for the sun to shine, that’s where the risk is, if it doesn’t recede enough for us to start the season in mid-April.” But whereas the Horbury Bridge clubhouse is safe because it is set on slightly higher ground, things are different at Ilkley CC, close to the River Wharfe. Henry Wilson, the first team captain, is down at the ground alongside Look North, who are filming the damage. “Obviously with the weather we had on Sunday, we were nervous,” he says, “with the River Wharfe rising. We’ve now been flooded four times in the last six years. Last year, after the flood, we built a perimeter wall around the clubhouse in the hope that it would avoid water getting in in the future. Unfortunately, you don’t know if it has worked until you’ve had another flood, and the water got over the wall and came through the drains. There’s probably three or four feet of water in the club house: in the carpets, up the walls, in the fridges. The carpets will have to be taken up again and replaced.” “We are insured. We’re hopeful. Most of the water has drained away from the ground, leaving just large puddles. The ground needs clearing of debris and leaves, then hopefully nature will take its course. “ “Like lots of sports clubs, we rely on a willing team of volunteers, we’re very fortunate to have that at Ilkley. So as sad as it is, as heartbreaking as it is, we’ll band together and put the work in.” Edenfield in Lancashire and Hadleigh in Suffolk are also casualties and any clubs near the swollen Severn are at risk. Worcestershire CCC is under water again, 4.5 metres on Monday with levels expected to peak on Wednesday. After so many previous floods – nine in the past two winters – the club hadn’t been flooded this offseason and the ground had been looking in spanking condition. Although no player cars have been washed away from the car park this time around – everyone has now learned their lesson once the flood warnings come – it is currently impossible to get into the pavilion. Kidderminster, Worcestershire’s reserve ground, will be on high alert, with that first game at HQ against Sussex less than nine weeks away. The ECB has been contacted by dozens of clubs who have been hit by flood and storm damage – with some unable to afford insurance after repeated flooding – and their flooding advice is now on the front page of their website. This is the eighth major flooding event to hit cricket in England and Wales since 2007. The most damaging storms were Desmond and Eva in 2015-16, which affected 58 clubs, and resulted in the ECB paying out £3m. Even last year, 38 clubs sought support from the ECB’s emergency pot. Other money is available through the County Grants Fund, which can help clubs become more flood resilient (as well as drought resilient and provide help with energy saving and water management) Although it is hard to link the frequency or intensity of storms to the climate crisis, the number of extreme weather events has increased and will continue to do so. As Dr Ella Gilbert from the University of Reading told BBC news: “We don’t know if we will see more storms in the future as the climate warms but what we do know is that climate change increases the impact of these sorts of storms, particularly when we get so many so close together … so they add up to be greater than the sum of their parts.” Cricket has been warned.

2/23/2022,"Last week, Republican senator Ted Cruz posted a photo of himself alongside UFC legend Chuck Liddell. The photo, which showed the two men posing with raised fists, was the latest example of a politician using an athlete’s star power, in this case to pander to a younger demographic. It also underscored the American right’s ongoing love affair with the UFC. Over the past few years, UFC has become synonymous with rightwing politics due to its well-documented relationship with former president Donald Trump. As previously reported by the Guardian, the organization effectively became the sports arm of the Maga regime and was an ideal platform for Trump to espouse his political agenda.  UFC president Dana White was among Trump’s most boisterous supporters, having campaigned for the former president as far back as 2016. White has since defended Trump’s policies, produced a documentary on him Combatant-in-Chief, and even used his relationship with the former president to defy government mandates at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. During the 2020 presidential election, Trump deployed several UFC fighters as campaign surrogates, placing them in front of crowds at rallies in swing-states such as Florida in order to secure a key demographic that forms the majority of mixed martial arts’ fanbase: young men. And though Trump lost the election, Republicans continued to flirt with the UFC in order to benefit from the organization’s popularity. UFC fighters and executives have become regular guests on conservative shows such as those hosted by Sean Hannity and Candace Owens. Over the past few months, Owens has invited fighters like UFC lightweight Beneil Dariush to discuss the woes of communism while White was brought on to discuss the supposed importance of keeping politics out of sports. “It’s America,” White told Owens in April 2021 when asked about the UFC’s supposed political apathy. “That’s the way it’s supposed to be. And you shouldn’t have to go to work and listen to that shit.” While White’s assertion is tenuous at best due to his own history with Trump, his comments endeared him to conservative audiences dissatisfied with the rise of social justice narratives in leagues such as the NFL and NBA. By taking saying the UFC does not support so-called “woke politics,” White is essentially positioning the organization as a fitting alternative for the American right. This, in turn, has warmed conservative pundits and politicians to the organization, which they now view as a market for their ideology. Among the politicians who embraced the UFC over the past year is Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, who invited the organization to host UFC 261, a capacity-crowd event in Jacksonville, Florida, in April 2021. DeSantis, who is viewed as a contender for the Republican nomination in 2024, has been criticized for using his state’s limited Covid restrictions to increase his political clout. Hosting a capacity-crowd UFC show during a particularly difficult period during the pandemic was a clear show of defiance. “This is going to be the first [indoor] full-throttle sports event since Covid hit anywhere in the United States and I think it’s fitting,” DeSantis said to a cheering crowd at the UFC 261 pre-fight press conference. “Welcome to Florida. You guys aren’t the only ones looking to come to this oasis of freedom.” It is worth noting that UFC 261 was celebrated by the likes of Steve Bannon, as well as user wrote on a QAnon Telegram channel with more than 20,000 subscribers. “Watch UFC.” UFC fighters have also stepped into the political arena in recent months. In December 2021, lightweight contender Michael Chandler spoke at Turning Point USA’s Americafest event alongside conspiracy-monger Tucker Carlson, Donald Trump Jr, and alt-right personality Jack Posobiec. Chandler first made his political leanings clear when he questioned the results of the 2020 presidential election, tweeting at the time “is Joe Biden really just taking the mic to talk about how ‘patient’ we have to be and how ‘long’ we are going to have to wait AKA we are going to contest these results…hard #wakeupsheep.” The fighter deleted the tweet shortly thereafter. Other UFC fighters such as Colby Covington, whom the Guardian described as the athletic embodiment of Trump’s politics, continues to strengthen his ties to prominent conservatives such as Trump Jr and Owens. In fact, Owens revealed that it was Covington who helped her become a fan of the UFC and that she plans to attend his upcoming fight against fellow Trump loyalist Jorge Masvidal at UFC 272 next month. “I will definitely be there [at UFC 272],” Owens said on Full Send podcast. “100% will be there. I love Colby.” Owens previously called for the UFC to replace the NFL as America’s national pastime, a term that was once reserved for baseball. “[The UFC] is exploding right now and it’s because they do not get involved in politics. They are not woke and they do not bend the knee,” Owens said, adding that the UFC is the “only real sport left.” It is perhaps no surprise many on the right identify more with the UFC than the NFL. Although the league is currently being sued for racial discrimination in a high-profile lawsuit, it has at least paid lip service to social justice in recent years, particularly after the police murder of George Floyd. According to a recent survey, approximately one-third of those polled stated that they were less of a fan of the NFL now than they were five years ago. The poll found that those who did not approve of the NFL’s current stance on social justice were disproportionately Republican, and that 45% of those who identified themselves as Republican believed the NFL was doing “too much” to show respect for Black players. Whether this disapproval is actually making a difference to the NFL’s bottom line is debatable. Viewing figures for the 2021 regular season were up 7% on the year before, so some Republicans are clearly still tuning in. Nevertheless, since the NFL’s policies no longer coincide with Republican ideals, the American right has since shifted much of its attention to the UFC, a hyper-masculine sport that is popular among young men. As Republicans forge ahead with shaping the GOP’s post-Trump future, they will continue to rely on the UFC as an ideological incubator and a breeding ground for future supporters.",Sport/Sport,‘They do not bend the knee’: US right courts UFC as NFL nods at social justice,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/23/they-do-not-bend-the-knee-us-right-courts-ufc-as-nfl-nods-at-social-justice
2/23/2022,"At some point half a decade ago I did the sensible thing: I packed away into boxes the dust-caked piles of CDs (largely unplayed for quite a while) that had followed me through various houseshares. In the following years I lugged those boxes to another rented home and on into storage as I moved to a different country. But I couldn’t truly let the CDs go, even though Spotify had been my main music source for at least 10 years. I no longer even own a fully functioning CD player. I sometimes half-joke that CDs are due a revival, largely to justify the above state of affairs. But it doesn’t seem to be beyond the realms of possibility, given 20-year nostalgia cycles and rolling waves of revivals for things from the 1990s and early 2000s; perhaps the CD could now be carried along in the flotsam.  Cassettes and vinyl have been revived to varying degrees. The tape resurgence seems a perennial staple of the music press, but it remains a going, if minor, concern. The vinyl revival has been much more widespread (and extensively documented). When vinyl seemed dead in the water in the 1990s, many ditched extensive collections and let record players slide into obsolescence. But now interest in vinyl crosses several types: the serious crate-diggers seeking original pressings and obscure sounds; the audiophiles and gearheads happy to drop cash on Klipsch speakers; the casual buyer who likes to own a few records; the lifestyle collector tastefully pairing a record with a bottle of natural wine. All of these have combined to create a robust ongoing market for vinyl, as the increasing number of independent record shops in many towns and cities will attest to. Demand has even begun to outstrip supply, while UK sales last year were at the highest level in 30 years. Vinyl sales are now on course to overtake CD sales according to figures from the Entertainment Retailers Association. This would suggest the vital signs are not good for CDs, but buried within that report was a sliver of hope for the unloved disc: the decline in sales has slowed – well, OK, it’s not much, but it’s a start. And in the US, CD sales increased last year for the first time in 17 years, though this was almost entirely due to the Adele album. Pitchfork has also reported more anecdotal hints to a mild CD revival, while Discogs, the key resale market for music online, showed big leaps in the number of CDs sold over the past two years, with some younger fans gravitating to the format as well. All this, of course, doesn’t amount to a full-scale comeback of anything; proof of a revival for CDs may come merely in the shape of comment pieces wondering if CDs are due a revival. And yet I have taken some solace in the idea of reverting to physical music formats during the Neil Young/Joni Mitchell contretemps with Joe Rogan and Spotify. Though the former were just two figures in a losing battle with a streaming giant, it hinted at the unspoken precariousness of streaming music: you may not be a Neil Young fan but what if your favourite artist gets in a row with Spotify? What if Spotify gets in a fight with a record label? What if Spotify ever goes down, or goes under? Granted, it now seems to be in the “too big to fail” category, just as the major labels were, until they weren’t. (God help us all if Apple Music is the answer.) The music analyst Ted Gioia recently asked, “Is old music killing new music?” Most of the money made is in old songs, so all the energy of the music business is being directed there, at the expense of new music, with various other factors compounding the issue. I’ll throw another theory into the mix: often when listening to some new artist I am reminded of an older artist – as is often the nature of music – at which point I’ll think, “Why don’t I just listen to the older band instead?” and then find myself swiftly drawn away from the new to the comforts of the old without difficulty. In a previous era you probably didn’t have the privileged, easy access to an artist’s entire output, but there might be one cherished record you engaged with deeply. Back when I used to buy CDs there would be a single-minded focus on each album: it was less easy to click away if you didn’t like the first two songs. I would listen repeatedly to something because I’d spent money on the sucker. In the Spotify age, my easily distracted brain is unlikely to stick with new music that doesn’t immediately grab me. Streaming remains unrelentingly dominant, but vinyl shows there are still gaps to be filled. Last year, the “bicoastal elite” duo How Long Gone, who make a semi-winking podcast about culture with a contrarian eye on being ahead of the curve, signed to the independent label Jagjaguwar to release an album of sorts – a compilation of the label’s music interspersed with conversation from the pair. They released it solely as a double CD. “It’s just a fun thing to do,” co-host Chris Black told the New York Times. “Tapes are corny. Vinyl is corny. CDs are cool.” I took that to mean both tapes and vinyl require an amount of earnestness – tapes in DIY sensibility, vinyl in studied connoisseurship – and both are over-valorised to boot, whereas CDs may have a certain casualness that appeals. Perhaps this then points to a future for CDs: an occasional tangible object for people who don’t want to try all that hard. Maybe someone could start selling a small, elegant, cheap-ish CD player that connects to a Bluetooth speaker? Either that or I just need to admit defeat and finally get rid of those neglected boxes of musical relics.

2/23/2022,"Amere 2,155 days after the US women’s soccer team filed a complaint with the USA’s Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and 1,082 days since the team filed a lawsuit against US Soccer, the team and the federation announced a settlement on Tuesday. Unusually for legal action, the terms of the settlement were immediately made public: $24m, with $2m of that money earmarked for “USWNT players in their post-career goals and charitable efforts related to women’s and girls’ soccer.”  Now comes the hard part. The deal is contingent on the ratification of a new contract between the federation and the players. That new contract is tied up in part because US Soccer president Cindy Cone has insisted that the men’s and women’s national teams come together with the federation to figure out the pesky problem of how to pay both national teams equally when Fifa’s prize money for World Cups is hugely unequal – $440m for the men in 2022 against a proposed $60m for the women in 2023. On a related note, all parties that take women’s soccer seriously would very much like Fifa to even out that prize money. Today. Yesterday. It’s money Fifa could afford to, considering the organization made around $3.5bn in profit from the 2018 World Cup alone. “We’re not wondering if the women’s game can make money,” Megan Rapinoe said of Fifa on a Tuesday conference call. “It’s just willful discrimination and willful negligence.” Since 2018, the US men have been playing under the terms of an expired collective bargaining agreement. The women agreed in December to extend their current deal through March. Players on Tuesday’s conference call said they’ve been working with the men’s team on CBA talks, and Becky Sauerbrunn noted that lawyers have been coming up with creative proposals. But representatives for the men’s players association did not return a request for comment from the Guardian, nor has the association posted anything on its Twitter feed, which instead focused on the match-up of two USMNT stars in the Champions League tie between Chelsea (Christian Pulisic) and Lille (Timothy Weah). The lawsuit settlement seems rather generous given the team’s losses in court. Last year, US district judge R Gary Klausner granted a partial summary judgment in favor of the federation, accepting the argument that the women had actually been paid more than the men, albeit in a cycle in which the World Cup champion women were considerably more successful than their male counterparts, who failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. A more damning argument: In their 2017 collective bargaining agreement, the women had accepted not just a different pay scale but a completely different structure. Given the lack of professional opportunities throughout most of women’s soccer’s history, the federation has long paid salaries and benefits to most of the team’s most frequent players. Klausner wrote that the women’s team rejected an offer to go to the men’s “pay-to-play” structure and therefore couldn’t “retroactively deem their CBA worse.” And even if the men and women manage to coordinate on their CBAs, the teams will still have some differences. Sauerbrunn said on Tuesday that the team still wants to negotiate issues such as maternity leave, which will be tricky as coach Vlatko Andonovski expands the player pool rather than following the precedent of sticking with the same faces. On the other hand, from the federation’s point of view, $24m is certainly less than $67m, the figure cited by an economist filing a brief on behalf of the women’s team. Cone, herself a longtime player for the national team, argued that such a payout “would likely bankrupt the federation.” That dramatic statement might not be literally true. The pandemic and other factors brought the federation’s spending plans to a screeching halt and, paradoxically, resulted in a surplus in the fiscal year ending March 2021. The federation, which had previously planned to spend that pile of assets down to $42m by March 2023, is now targeting $102m by that date. But the federation has a lot on its plate, not the least of which is building up national teams that have either aged (women) or underachieved (men). Since landing a $50m windfall with the hosting of the Copa America Centenario in 2016, US Soccer has been under pressure to invest in many areas – coaching education, extended national teams (disability soccer, beach soccer, futsal), the US Open Cup (including a new competition for women) and grassroots grants programs. The settlement also surely removes a sizable chunk of legal fees from the budget, though the federation still faces interminable lawsuits from the NASL and sports promoter Relevent Sports – both represented by Jeffrey Kessler, who also represents the US women and once represented MLS players in an ill-fated legal action against the league and federation. Also still suing the federation – Hope Solo, the longtime US women’s goalkeeper who wound up going her own way in court. Perhaps most important of all for the federation is a rare bit of good PR, or at least an interruption in the drumbeat of bad PR. The women found little trouble attracting sympathetic reporters, influencers and documentarians who eschewed numbers and even touted “equal pay” deals in other countries that are, in fact, not equal and pay both men and women considerably less than US Soccer does. “Management,” even when it’s a volunteer-driven nonprofit, is never the popular side in a labor dispute. The federation’s former legal team and former president Carlos Cordeiro took that bad hand and made it worse. Cordeiro was tone-deaf in public statements, even at a parade for the women after their 2019 championship. The legal team argued that women lacked not just the speed and strength of men’s players but also the skill and effort, an argument that was all the more insulting because it was hardly necessary, given the strength of the federation’s other arguments. Cordeiro is running again for his old gig, and Rapinoe noted on Tuesday’s call that he didn’t have her vote. She doesn’t officially have a vote, but Sauerbrunn and Morgan do, along with several recent national team players who are part of the Athletes Council. The settlement surely bolsters Cone’s case for re-election. But she still has to deal with negotiations with men’s and women’s players who have grown accustomed to being paid more than their peers. Cone is hopeful things will be nailed down before the women’s extension expires on 31 March. “Are we close?” Cone said on Tuesday’s call. “It depends on your definition of close. Are we going in the right direction? Yes.”",Sport/Football,The USWNT got $24m in their equal pay battle.

2/23/2022,"Here is a luxuriously sleazy-sentimental melodrama about the Mumbai underworld, directed with gusto by Sanjay Leela Bhansali, the powerhouse Bollywood film-maker who 20 years ago had a Bafta nomination for his mighty epic Devdas. It is an adaptation from a tale in the true-crime reportage bestseller Mafia Queens of Mumbai by Hussain Zaidi: the story of Gangubai Kathiawadi, who in the 60s was tricked and trafficked into prostitution in Mumbai’s Kamathipura red-light zone, but through her survivor’s ruthlessness and shrewd cultivation of political connections rose to become an underworld madam involved in drugs and violent crime. She then parlayed this gangland prestige into a media profile, campaigning for sex workers’ rights, even – according to legend – meeting to discuss these with India’s first prime minister Nehru himself. Alia Bhatt plays Gangubai, the innocent provincial girl who dreams of movie stardom and believes the sinister smoothie boyfriend luring her to the big city. Then she is imprisoned, raped and savagely brutalised in the brothel, but becomes a kind of unofficial union rep for the other women and pleads for justice from a local chieftain of city politics: Karim Lala (Ajay Devgn) to whom she extends the brothel’s onsite booze franchise in return. And so her upward climb begins, which involves a political duel with a rival, trans madam Raziabai, played by Vijay Raaz.  This fictionalised version omits any violence in which Gangubai was reportedly involved and drugs are demurely replaced with alcohol being sold on the premises; when Gangubai finally evolves from being a mafia queen into a revered Mother India figure, blessed by smiling sex workers all around Mumbai, the movie loses a bit of its voltage. But there is terrific verve and audacity in this picture and some spectacular fantasy-musical setpieces. In fact, it is the streak of schmaltz within the gruesomeness which gives the story its outrageous energy.

2/23/2022,"American cowboy James Abbott McNeill Whistler and his flame-haired Irish lover Joanna Hiffernan go on a wild rampage and shoot the art world of Victorian Britain to bits in this hugely enjoyable artistic and biographical romp. It’s such a well-told story it will doubtless inspire a so-so film coming to a streaming service near you soon. Don’t wait for that, go to the Royal Academy and enjoy a life-affirming adventure with the mothers and fathers of modern art. To appreciate how new and subversive the double act of Hiffernan and Whistler were in 1860s London you have to realise how clogged Victorian art was. A wall of it suffices to set the airless scene. Dante Gabriel Rossetti’s Annunciation is claustrophobic, a narrow picture of a small room where the figures are bled of life in their pseudo-medieval aesthetic prison. Then you look at the opposite wall and a raw, boozy, sexual slice of real life startles you awake.  Whistler’s painting Wapping is disorientating. We are in London’s docklands in the early 1860s. Charles Dickens had recently published Great Expectations. We picture Victorian London through a Dickensian gothic fog – but Wapping depicts it with harsh yet sensual realism. This is a modern city, where a group of bohemian types hang out at a riverside bar overlooking a grey and green vista of tangled sailing boats and clippers. In the middle of the party, Hiffernan throws back her hair. It’s as if she and Whistler think they are in the free and easy world of the Paris avant garde. That was where Whistler learned to see, when he lived in Paris in the 1850s and got to know such radical observers as Gustave Courbet, Édouard Manet and Charles Baudelaire, whose essay The Painter of Modern Life was published when Whistler was working on Wapping. The creamy palette and ironic accepting eye he brings to a modern moment by the Thames translates the feeling of Manet’s masterpieces Le Déjeuner sur l’Herbe and Olympia to London. All the fun of the French is transplanted to the England of Gladstone and Disraeli. What do we know of Hiffernan outside Whistler’s art? Born in Limerick in 1839, she was 21 when she met the dandified artist. She didn’t have much formal education but her reading was wide and her opinions astute, said contemporaries: she may have been an aspiring artist as well as model. The three scandalous celebrity paintings Whistler did of Hiffernan wearing a long white dress are all brought together here and they can be seen as a true collaboration. This is modelling as performance art. The pure white dress, you see, is a joke. There’s nothing virginal about Hiffernan in Whistler’s 1862 icon Symphony in White, No 1. She stands above you confidently, and Whistler makes the supposedly modest dress suggest her nakedness underneath. That’s because she is standing on a bearskin rug whose soft fur leads your eyes to the rim of the dress, to picture her naked feet nestling in it – a traditional image of sensuality in sculpture that goes back to Renaissance images of the triumphant David with his foot in Goliath’s hair. The painting’s first audience may not have been prepared to imagine this but were sufficiently shocked by Hiffernan’s loose red hair and relaxed manner. It flaunts a love all too ready to speak its name. Whistler wittily parodies the pre-Raphaelites with their “muses” and fetishistic allusions to repressed desire. He might as well have written on the canvas: “I’m sleeping with her.” The second Symphony in White shows her in a double image: she poses elegantly against a fireplace like a living decoration for the stylish bourgeois home – Japanese fan and all – yet we see her face, turned from us, meditating ambiguously in the mantlepiece mirror. This is a deepening effect Whistler gets from Velázquez’s Rokeby Venus. Whistler and Hiffernan set out for Madrid to study Velázquez together but got distracted when they found a love nest in the Pyrenees. Whistler watches Hiffernan naked in the studio in an unfinished scene. He shows her sleeping, and contemplating glistening Chinese porcelain while posing in a kimono. He imagines her as a woman from the “floating world”. His mother – as in Whistler’s Mother – urged him to make an “honest woman” of Hiffernan: his response was not to marry but to make a will in which he left her everything. In the event she died before him, in her mid-40s in 1886. The story this show tells, however, climaxes at Trouville in Normandy where they stayed with Courbet in autumn 1865. Eating seafood in a half-empty hotel, painting on the beach, listening to Hiffernan sing Irish songs at twilight – Courbet remembered it as a romantic time. This part of the story really would make a great little film, if François Truffaut was still around to direct it. Courbet painted Hiffernan, too. He kept the original with him always, painting replicas to sell. But which of the three versions on show is his treasured possession? It has to be Jo, the Beautiful Irish Girl from the Nationalmuseum, Stockholm, with its nostalgic passion. There are rumours it all went further: that Hiffernan might even have been the model for Courbet’s outrageous painting The Origin of the World. But the curators haven’t found any evidence that she was in Paris. Besides, Courbet was struck by her red hair. As a ginger, I can point out that she would also have had red pubic hair, which the model for The Origin of the World didn’t. In fact, the Jo Hiffernan who haunts this exhibition is never objectified, never a piece of artist’s meat. It’s a surprisingly tender love story that also brings to life one of the most revolutionary moments in the story of art, when cobwebs of hypocrisy and pretension were swept away by life itself.

2/23/2022,"For a while, the four teenage boys, Alex, Filmon, Osman and Mulue, did a reasonably good job of looking after each other. Filmon and Mulue had met in Eritrea before they embarked on their long, dangerous journey to Britain; the others became friends en route or in London, in a park near a Home Office registration centre for unaccompanied child refugees. Their similar backgrounds drew them together, as did the shared experience of travelling 3,300 miles in search of safety. Mulue and Alex had both spent time in foster care before moving into independent accommodation; Osman and Filmon were living in a hostel in north London. They had all become used to surviving without parents, instead leaning on each other for support. All of them were also struggling with the unsettling reality of their precarious new lives, which was so different from the expectations they had clung to during their traumatic journeys.  They battled against homesickness. Sometimes they would try to ward it off by cooking meals together, but having left home aged 13 or 14, their skills were basic. “Once Filmon got very hungry during the night and wanted some food. He had no idea how to cook, and neither did I, so we just boiled potatoes with salt and ate together,” another friend, Abel (not his real name), remembers. Sometimes they danced together. The young friends worried about each other, and tried to ensure they all remained on the straight and narrow – getting cross if they thought one of their group was drinking too much or behaving badly. Osman, who was Muslim, invited his friends to his house to celebrate Easter because they were Orthodox Eritrean Christians. “He did this for us, even though he didn’t celebrate Easter. I remember thinking how kind this was,” Abel said, in an inquest statement. “We all washed our clothes and dressed in some of Osman’s clothes. I still have some of Osman’s clothes now, which makes me very sad to think about.” But in the end, the stress of their experiences and the lack of consistent support in the UK proved too much. In the space of 16 months, all four of the boys killed themselves: first in November 2017, Filmon Yemane, 18; then a couple of weeks later, Alexander Tekle, 18; then in May 2018, Osman Ahmed Nur, 19; and finally, in February 2019, Mulubrhane Medhane Kfleyosus (Mulue), 19. Their deaths shone a spotlight on the systems Britain has in place for supporting vulnerable child refugees. A series of inquests, the last of which concluded last month, drew critical conclusions about failings in the care that the state provided to a group of boys who desperately needed help. Robel, 17, knew all four boys. He is also a refugee from Eritrea; the quartet treated him like their younger brother. He wants them to be remembered, he tells me, when we meet in a west London cafe – and he hopes their deaths will trigger change. Robel (who has asked for his full name not to be printed) was only 12 when he left his family in Eritrea. Like his four friends, he was fleeing Eritrea’s poverty, human rights abuses and its harsh conscription, which begins at 18 and is open-ended – it usually lasts for between five and 10 years, but can last up to 20. He met Alex at the refugee encampment in Calais; the older boy immediately took him under his wing. Robel keeps a photograph of the two of them eating together in a tent in the camp, both looking strikingly young. “He was kind to me. He teased me a bit, because he was three years older, but he was quite small too, a kid, like all of us,” Robel remembers. They spent an afternoon playing football with other teenagers near the slum-like settlement on the town’s outskirts. Neither of them was very good. “We lost, but we had a really good time. He made jokes that would make everyone laugh. He was a really caring person.” Alex’s father, Tecle Tesfamichel, told the inquest the same thing about his son, describing by phone how, when his son watched him work at his carpentry job, he would remind his father to wear gloves so he didn’t injure himself. Alex didn’t much like maths, but was good at geography; as a child he had dreamed of becoming a professional cyclist. Tecle knew that Alex’s journey to the UK had been really difficult, but also that his son had shielded his family from the most disturbing details. “When he was living in a tent [in France] he didn’t have enough food or warm clothing, and it was freezing. During one conversation he told me he had shaved his head because he had caught head lice … But he would tell us not to worry, that once he had got his papers and found a job, he would send money to help and support us.” Robel bumped into Alex again after they had both managed to make their way to London (Alex in a refrigerated lorry, Robel in the back of a van), and was delighted, and relieved, to see a familiar face. They would meet to play table football and listen to music together after school at a Refugee Council support group. Later Robel was introduced to Mulue, so they could attend the Eritrean Orthodox church together. He remembers Mulue sticking his head out of the window and throwing his keys down, so Robel could come up and join him; Robel was impressed by how relaxed and friendly he was. At that time Robel was being looked after by foster carers and had no pocket money, so was always hungry after school. “Mulue used to look after me; he’d buy me chicken wings,” he remembers. Robel met Filmon only a few times, in the park near the Home Office, but knew Osman better. Osman borrowed his hat, a black woollen number decorated with a star, and liked it. “I gave it to him.” He remembers that his friends were worried about Osman, who had become increasingly paranoid and was scared by the voices he heard in his head. “I didn’t feel I could ask him if he was OK; I didn’t know him well enough to talk to him about it,” he says. The four boys didn’t often talk about their experiences on their journeys, but details that came out at the inquests reveal some of their horrific ordeals: people traffickers attempting to kidnap them to sell them on, routine violence from rival smuggling gangs, travelling with 150 people in the back of one lorry, friends drowning in the Mediterranean, experiencing torture in a migrant holding camp in Libya, going for 11 days without food, contracting malaria, along with constant thirst and hunger. After surviving all this came the disappointment of arriving in the UK. “I had an idea we would come to a really good place, where people have everything,” Robel says, laughing at his naivety. “But you arrive here and it’s not what you imagined, and you can’t accept that. You don’t have a home. You’re worried about your family. It’s really difficult.” Abel echoed the point in the statement he gave at Alex’s inquest. “When we were travelling from Eritrea to the UK, we thought the UK was like heaven. We thought everything would be OK once we got here.” Swedish research suggests the risk of suicide among unaccompanied child refugees is nine times that of children of the same age in the Swedish population. There is no equivalent research in the UK, but campaigners are aware of at least 13 deaths of teenage refugees in the past five years. Most of them have been Eritrean, possibly because Eritreans and Ethiopians have together recently made up the largest nationality group of unaccompanied minors to arrive in the UK. About 80% of Eritrean asylum claims are granted – a reflection of the seriousness of the threats they face at home. But it takes, on average, 550 days for applications to be approved – a period of uncertainty that leads to heightened stress. The circumstances of each of the boys’ deaths are very different, but all fell through the cracks of the system, and the coroners acknowledged that none of them received the full care and attention they should have. A coroner noted that staff at the sheltered housing where Filmon was living were aware that his condition was deteriorating, but failed to escalate concerns about him being suicidal to the correct teams. When he died, Osman, who was learning English and training to be a carpenter, was known to be worried about whether his refugee status was going to be revoked. He had started to self-medicate with alcohol and cannabis, and the coroner found he had not received the support he should have done when he described feeling suicidal. The coroner at Mulue’s inquest said the seriousness of his mental health issues had not been recognised. Alex’s inquest concluded that he had wrongly been assessed as being an adult by Home Office staff. As a result, rather than being sent to live with a foster family, he was moved to accommodation for adult asylum seekers, where he was violently assaulted and began drinking heavily. The mistake was rectified but even then overworked social workers struggled to get him the help he urgently needed. His inquest noted that this mistake contributed to the “destructive spiral” that led to his death. Robel says there was a key difference between the way he and his four, now dead, friends were cared for on arrival in the UK. Robel, who was 13 when he arrived, was allocated foster parents. They kept a close eye on what he was doing – if on a school night he wanted to stay out late with his Eritrean friends, they would bombard him with anxious text messages, instructing him to come home immediately. If he ignored them, they said he wouldn’t be allowed to play football in the Sunday league. “They would tell the coach to keep me on the bench. I really loved football,” he says. He resented it at the time, but now recognises how important it was to be treated as a child who needed boundaries and support like any other. “I was being annoying, but they made me come back on time and go to school. It would have been helpful for the others to have someone like that in their lives.” Last year dozens of charities called on the government to make a string of policy changes to support young refugees, after these deaths and a number of others among teenage asylum seekers who fled persecution. But, given funding cuts to local authorities and the government’s determination to appear tough on asylum seekers, there is a weary recognition in the refugee sector that sweeping change looks unlikely. Campaigners would like the Home Office to be more sensitive in the way that age assessments are conducted on teenage asylum seekers when they arrive in the UK. Child refugee campaigners say the well-documented culture of disbelief within the Home Office means officials often launch age assessments with the premise “that this kid’s telling a lie, so we should work on the assumption that they’re probably an adult”. In December, the chief inspector of prisons expressed serious concerns about how staff at the Home Office reception facilities in Dover attempted to establish the age of new arrivals without professional interpreters. “We observed staff attempting to establish ages by use of hand signals,” he wrote. Instead the Home Office is planning to take an even tougher line on age assessments of refugees. In December the home secretary, Priti Patel, said the nationality and borders bill would put an end to the “appalling abuse” of “grown adult men masquerading as children” to claim asylum, and said new funding would be given to enable checks on teeth, fusion of bones in the wrist and MRI imaging to “stop these abuses”. Campaigners want child refugees to be housed away from hostels, and to get continued care when they turn 18 because, often, they are not yet equipped to live independent adult lives and the drop-off in support can be catastrophic. Better mental health provision should be given in recognition of the unimaginably difficult experiences they have endured during their journeys. Benny Hunter, a campaigner for migrant and refugee rights, met Alex as a volunteer refugee worker in Calais, and tried for months to get him help. He remembers that some social workers were very impressive, but says: “The logic of the hostile environment is so entrenched that some social workers feel it is their job to protect overstretched services rather than protect children from harm.” In a statement, the Home Office acknowledged that “unprecedented pressure” on asylum accommodation means that young refugees are being housed in hotels and hostels. It added: “We take the welfare of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children extremely seriously. These incidents are absolutely tragic, and our thoughts go out to all of their families.” But it is at the grassroots level that some positive action has stemmed from the boys’ deaths. Dehab Woldu, who has worked with child refugees for 20 years, met Alex and Mulue through her work, and liked them both. Mulue was shy and reserved with her initially, but came to treat her as a mother figure, delighted to find someone he could talk to freely in Tigrinya (the main language spoken in Eritrea). “He was ambitious, he wanted to learn, he talked about his education. I felt he was someone who was going to be OK here,” she says. She was equally fond of Alex. “I’d say: ‘Be a good boy, concentrate on your education.’ And he’d say: ‘Yes, I’ll make you proud!’ He was a really pleasant, likable young boy.” She remembers too the surge of frustration as she prepared food for one of the memorial services. “I thought: ‘What’s the point of doing the shopping for the wake if I can’t even help them before they die?’” she says. So she rallied the support of the older Eritrean community and, with Hunter, set up the Da’aro Youth project in south London. Every week, dozens of teenagers who have arrived from Eritrea (mostly boys, but a few girls) meet to eat a hot meal and play table football and three-a-side football. “I was very distressed by the deaths. I couldn’t sleep. We wanted to draw a line, and say this cannot be allowed to happen again,” Woldu says. She and a team of adult colleagues and volunteers are present to help teenagers discuss their asylum problems and college applications. Sometimes they help teenagers who have become homeless, or whose ages have been disputed by the Home Office, or who need extra mental health support. “The three hours every week is very useful. It gives them confidence. They leave the club with a swagger they don’t have when they arrive.” The group has been a huge success locally, but it’s clear that a national support programme is needed. Last September, Robel was horrified to discover another Eritrean teenager he had met, Ermias Brhane, 19, had killed himself, the fifth acquaintance to do so. “We’d played football together a few weeks earlier. I laughed when he turned up in jeans, and asked: ‘How are you going to play football dressed like that?’ That night I noticed he spent a long time sitting by himself, in deep thought. I remember an older man asking me if he was OK; I said I didn’t know. I should have asked him what the matter was. Maybe I could have helped,” he says, adding that the deaths make him feel sad and angry. “I don’t want to see this happen again.” There was no family at the one-hour inquest held into Ermias’s death in December. “These kids are just dying and no one is asking why or even how many,” Hunter says. “It’s horrendous.”In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

2/23/2022,"Britain will stop Russia selling sovereign debt in London as part of a “very serious package” of sanctions that will “inflict pain” on Vladimir Putin, Liz Truss has said. As the Conservative party came under increasing pressure to sever links with wealthy Russian donors, the foreign secretary announced that a ban on the sale of sovereign debt, issued as bonds by governments in foreign currencies to finance growth and development, was part of a package of measures announced after Putin deployed military forces into two regions of eastern Ukraine on Tuesday.  “We’ve been very clear that we’re going to limit Russian access to British markets,” Truss told Sky News. “We’re going to stop the Russian government with raising sovereign debt in the United Kingdom. “There will be even more tough sanctions on key oligarchs, on key organisations in Russia, limiting Russia’s access to the financial markets, if there is a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.” The prime minister and the Treasury had called in finance bosses and regulators to discuss how to ensure recently announced sanctions against Russia were effective, the BBC reported. In order to limit sovereign debt sales in London, Britain would need additional legislation, according to western officials. Boris Johnson revealed a package of asset freezes on five Russian banks and three wealthy people on Tuesday but faced criticism from Conservative MPs for not going further. Truss said the government was taking an “escalatory approach” with international allies, adding that she believed Putin was “hell-bent” on a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, including the capital, Kyiv. “We will agree a further package in the event, which we think is highly likely, of a full-scale invasion into Ukraine,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We don’t want to be in the situation … where we’ve got nothing left in the locker. She added: “Nothing is off the table in terms of who we’re targeting.” The former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt told the Today programme that if the UK was to avoid “being two steps behind in the diplomatic chess game” it had to take Putin by surprise. “The most important is to do sanctions – economic and financial sanctions – that are tough enough and last long enough to reduce the ability of the Russian state to finance the Russian military. And that means we have got to be prepared to dig in for the long term.” The Conservative party is also coming under increasing pressure to break links to Russian oligarchs who have donated more than £2m to the party. On Wednesday the shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, said there was “too much connection between Russian oligarchs” and donations to the Conservative party. “Give it back [and] send a message that we’re serious,” Lammy told Kay Burley on Sky News. “It sends a statement. If the money is Russian-linked, if there’s any suggestion that some of it has come from oligarchs who might be close to Putin – give the money back.” But Truss told Today that the accusation the UK was not tougher on Russia because the Conservative party had taken donations from people close to the Putin regime was “completely wrong”. Asked by Burley on Sky News if the party would be returning the donations, Truss avoided the question and said all donations were made by British citizens and were properly declared. Pushed on whether there were sanctions on the oligarch Roman Abramovich, as Johnson stated in parliament, Truss said the prime minister “misspoke” and the record would be corrected. Asked whether the Champions League final – due to be held in St Petersburg on 10 June – should go ahead in Russia in light of the crisis in Ukraine, Truss said: “I’m very clear it shouldn’t be.”",News/World news,"UK will stop Russia selling sovereign debt in London, says Liz Truss",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/uk-russia-ukraine-liz-truss
